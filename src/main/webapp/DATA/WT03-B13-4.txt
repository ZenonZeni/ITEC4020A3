The United States remains deeply concerned about the
ongoing violence and killing in Burundi. Too many
people have lost their lives because extremist forces
have chosen to settle their differences through
violence rather than dialogue.

We continue to call on all Burundians to reject
extremism and to resolve their differences through
peaceful means. A constructive dialogue involving all
key political leaders is necessary to begin the
process of ending the violence in Burundi and
fostering national reconciliation.

The United States is watching events in Burundi
closely and will continue to work with the
international community to defuse tensions in Burundi
and prevent further violence. As we approach the new
year, the United States calls on the people of
Burundi to renounce violence and demand peace from
all parties.

The President is disappointed that the Congress has
chosen to override the veto of H.R. 1058, the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As he said
in his veto message, he supports the goals of
securities litigation reform and believes that there
should be an end to frivolous lawsuits, but is
concerned about how this legislation might affect
small investors with legitimate complaints. The
President hopes that the unintended consequences of
the legislation do not materialize, but if they do,
he will work for administrative and/or legislative
rememdies to protect small investors.

Remarks by the President at Congressional Meeting

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President at
Congressional Meeting
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 12:52 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: I hope -- as you see, we're running a
little behind today, so I hope you'll forgive us if
we don't do a lot of questions; we have a lot of work
to do. But let me just say from my point of view, I
am pleased that our representatives met yesterday.
They did make some progress. Obviously, a lot of the
biggest issues remain. But the process seems to be
working and I'm encouraged, and I want to continue to
do it until we reach agreement on a balanced budget.
That's what I think clearly we all want. 

I would say here that two days before Christmas I
hope some way can be found to get the check for the
three and a half million veterans and the aid to the
8 million children who need it just to exist. And
there are almost half a million federal workers who
have been working who won't get their paychecks today
that they would otherwise get. So I think those
problems need to be addressed. 

But on the other issue, I at least believe that we
made some good progress yesterday and I'm looking
forward to the report today and continuing this
process until we succeed, until we get this job done.
 
Q Can we ask the leaders, Mr. President, if they will
get the checks out and --
 
Q Do you think the Congress should go home when
millions are denied subsistence checks over
Christmas?
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just say, if I could
for a second, Mr. President, I think both the House
and Senate hope to get those bills down here today so
that the -- the AFTC and the -- as the President
mentioned the other day on television.
 
Q What are the chances of reopening the government,
Mr. Speaker?
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: I think we're going to talk about
that now.
 
Q Mr. Speaker, do you feel like a dog being wagged by
its tail? (Laughter.)
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: It's amazing you guys get paid for
some of these questions, on the eve of Christmas.
Merry Christmas. 

Q No, it's not my expression, it's the President's
analysis.
 
THE PRESIDENT: I never called the Speaker a dog.
(Laughter.)
 
Q No, I know you didn't.
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: And I'm deeply grateful.
(Laughter.) 

Q Mr. President, do you think you can get a framework
of a deal by Christmas?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I'm prepared to -- let me just say,
I'm prepared to just keep working. I think all of us
want to have Christmas with our families, but beyond
that, I'm prepared to keep working, and I'm going to
do everything I can to succeed, and that's what we're
going to talk about.
 
Q Mr. Speaker --
 
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. We really need to go to
work.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
photo opportunity with congressional leaders
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 9:50 A.M. EST

Q Mr. President, are you close to a deal today? 

THE PRESIDENT: Let me tell you where we are today. We
had a very long discussion yesterday. We discussed
almost all the issues where we had differences on our
plans financially, in terms of the dollars. And this
morning we're going to have an extensive discussion
of the Medicare policy. And then we're going to give
our staffs some instruction. We're going to meet
again on Tuesday and we're going to do our best to
work through this and come to an accord. 
 
My New Year's wish is that we'll get this balanced
budget plan and we'll do it in a way that protects
the things that we care about -- the Medicare, the
Medicaid, the education and environment, the other
issues, and we've been working at it. I've been very
well pleased and I think we've been somewhat
successful because we haven't said very much about
it. We've just got to keep working until we reach an
accord.
 
Q Mr. President, will you touch on -- negotiations -- 

Q Will you leave town today without reopening the
government, of the three --
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: I'm sure we'll be talking about
that, that's one of the things we want to get done
and get agreed to. So we're trying to work out how to
get the federal employees back to work -- we'd also
like to get them paid, I think that's an integral
part of getting them back to work. But as the
President said, I think, frankly, most of our success
so far has been that we've been in this room talking
with each other and not getting involved in
negotiating in public, and I think we've made a lot
of progress. 

Q To follow on that, sir, is it healthy to have the
House speakers talking on CNN yesterday on the --
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: Oh, that is nonsense. I told the
President on Friday that I was so favorable about him
in answering their big question on Evans & Novak that
I thought he'd want to see it. The fact is we're
working very well together. I was asked a question
about the campaign next year, and I suspect if you
ask Mr. Gephardt or Vice President Gore about how
they'll campaign next year, they'll give you similar
answers. We're negotiating very well from a
government standpoint in here and I think we have a
lot to be proud of. Our New Year's wish ought to be
that we get this done and give the American people a
balanced budget and the government paid for and back
to work.
 
SENATOR DOLE: The Senate is going to meet at noon,
we'll try to pass something to help the federal
employees. 

Q Are you closer?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Oh, we're about six feet apart.
(Laughter.)
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: We'll be a lot closer in a couple of
hours. (Laughter.)
 
THE PRESIDENT: We're working at it steady. Happy New
Year everybody.
 
THE PRESS: Happy New Year.

(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 9:25 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. 
 
Q Mr. President, do you hope to go to Bosnia in the
next month or so?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I want to go when the Secretary of
Defense and General Shalikashvili tell me it's an
appropriate thing to do. I don't want to interrupt
the deployment in any way. You know, we've had a few
weather delays, but I'm here to get a briefing on the
deployment and what's going on and how we're doing.
I've got a few questions I want to ask. If it were
solely up to me, I would go tomorrow -- literally
tomorrow. But I think it's very important that I not
do anything which interrupts the deployment. I can go
as soon as it's consistent with the military mission,
and I will do that. 
 
Q What have you heard so far, even before this
briefing, on how the operation is going in Bosnia? 
 
THE PRESIDENT: I think our people are doing a very
good job. I think the others in IFOR are doing a good
job, and I think the people there, so far, are
receiving them well. But I've got some specific
questions, and that's why I want this briefing.
 
Q Do you think Senator Dole should go if you can't
go?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I think that all of us should consult
with the military leaders and do what is consistent
with the interest of our troops and the mission. 
 
Q That means no?
 
Q Mr. President, do you worry about casualties? 

THE PRESIDENT: Every day I worry about that, but I
think they're doing a very good job. They're showing
their training and their discipline and the integrity
of the plan in the way that they are working to
minimize casualties and maximize the effectiveness of
the mission.
 
Q Do you think the American people understand that,
understand the risks that are involved?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Interview of the President
by armed forces radio
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

THE PRESIDENT: First let me say that I have just come
from a briefing here at the Pentagon with our senior
military officials who are working on the mission in
Bosnia. We've also had a teleconference with General
Joulwan, getting the latest up-to-date briefing on
the conditions of the deployment. And I would say --
I should emphasize to you two things.
 
One is that notwithstanding some weather problems and
a few delays occasioned by Christmas traffic on the
rails in Germany, we're pretty much on schedule. And
secondly, and even more important, the attitude
toward compliance thus far in Bosnia by all parties
has been quite good. Now, it's early in the mission,
but so far the attitude toward compliance has been
very good and we're encouraged by that. And we think
we can stay on schedule for the separation of the
forces and the other elements of it.
 
And also, in this Christmas season, I'd like to
remind the people who serve our country that we are
doing this essentially for three reasons. First of
all, because we can do it, and when we can do
something like this it's consistent with our values
to stop suffering and slaughter on the scale we've
seen it in Bosnia. 

Second, because it's very much in our interest to
contain and end this war, to prevent it from
spreading in a way that can involve our NATO allies
on opposite sides and many other countries that are
critical to the stability of Europe. It's also
important for us to do what we can to promote a
stable and democratic and free Europe. We, after all,
have fought two world wars because we did not have
such a Europe; we had a long Cold War because we did
not have such a Europe. So it's in our interest.
 
And finally, it is critical to our ability to lead
the world for the next 10 or 20 years as we sort out
what the security arrangements of the post-Cold War
era will be. I can tell you that our leadership of
NATO specifically, and in general, our ability to
lead in the world toward peace and democracy is very
much tied to our willingness to assume a leadership
role in this Bosnia mission. 

I could see it on my recent trip to Europe -- whether
it was talking to prime ministers in Great Britain or
Ireland or Germany or Spain, or just to people on the
street. It means a lot to them to know that the
United States is still there working and leading and
being a good partner.
 
So, for all these reasons, I think this is a very,
very important mission to our country.
 
Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President -- after Operation
Joint Endeavor, what do you see as the U.S. role in
that area, formerly known as Yugoslavia? What will be
our role there? 

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think, first of all, we'll
still be there through NATO and whatever role that
NATO assumes in the general area beyond our NATO
member nations. But more importantly, I would expect
after this mission is over we will continue to have
American citizens, both people who work for and
represent our government, and people in the private
sector, going in and out of there helping in the
reconstruction effort, contributing to that,
supporting the political process in whatever way we
can.
 
But I think it is quite important that the NATO force
not become an occupying army. We're not dealing with
Berlin here. We're not -- all we're trying to do is
to give this peace agreement a chance to take hold.
And we have a very clear and limited mission. In
fact, I want to make sure that all of our folks know
that, as far as I know, this peace agreement is the
first one ever where the military annex to the
agreement was actually written by the military
commanders who were going to be expected to implement
it.
 
That is, the parties actually ask our military people
to fashion the military annex to the agreement that
was initialed in Dayton so that there would be a
limited, defined, strictly military mission.
 
Q Mr. President, do you agree with the premise that
Bosnia is really the first test of post-Cold War
policy?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's been tested in
other ways, but it's certainly the most significant
military test of our post-Cold War policy if you
accept the premise that what happened in the Gulf at
the Gulf War could have occurred during the Cold War
as well as afterward; that this is literally a
post-Cold War problem. Then it is the biggest
military test.
 
Q Does that mean that -- what is the success or
failure of this then mean to American foreign policy
10, 15 years down the line?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just say I think the most
important thing here is that the United States was
prepared to lead and to work with our NATO allies. If
you remember, in the beginning when the Bosnian War
broke out, a lot of our European allies said, well,
we ought to take the leadership role here, we'll do
this; we'll do it through the United Nations. And
we've played a very strong supporting role through
NATO. After all, it's important that the United
States never forget that during these last four,
tough years we led in the conduct of the largest
humanitarian airlift in history; we led in enforcing
the no-fly zone, keeping the war out of the air, and
a lot of other things that were done, including
NATO's willingness to use air strikes to, first of
all, bring about a relatively peaceful 1994, and then
to bring about the conditions in which a peace
agreement could be made in 1995.
 
But what I believe this means, if we make this effort
and if we succeed in our military mission, even if,
God forbid, after we're all gone the thing should
come apart, at least we will be united in doing what
we can do to promote stability in Europe and to take
a stand for peace in the post-Cold War era.
 
If you remember when I sent our troops into Haiti
with a U.N.-led mission, and then when I left a
smaller number there when the United Nations took
over on schedule, I always said that we could not
guarantee the people of Haiti a future, they would
have to do that for themselves. The same is true for
the Bosnians. We cannot guarantee for them a future
without war. What we can guarantee for them is a year
without war, during which they can implement their
own agreement and in which time they can have
elections, they can begin the economic
reconstruction, they can begin to see the benefits of
peace, and then some equilibrium within the country
can be established from a security point of view.
 
But think it would be a mistake for the United States
or for NATO to believe that we should be going around
anywhere guaranteeing the results of peace agreements
which have to be guaranteed in the minds and hearts
of the people who are making them. 

So this will be a success for our alliance, for our
leadership, just by doing the mission. Obviously, it
will be a much, much greater success if the
humanitarian relief, the refugee relocation, the
economic reconstruction all are completely successful
and Bosnia has a permanent peace. That is the real
measure of success. But the main thing is we have to
define together where we must try and where we must
stand against chaos. And I think we've done a good
job of that here.

Q Mr. President, under what circumstances would you
order the U.S. forces to withdraw from Bosnia within
the next year, before the one-year mark?
 
THE PRESIDENT: The only circumstance that I can
imagine doing that is if the mission no longer
existed. That is, keep in mind, we are there not to
fight a war, we are there not to stop a war, we are
there to implement a peace agreement. We anticipate
that there will be violations of this agreement, but
that the leaders will not abandon it and that the
vast bulk of the people will not abandon it. So we
have to be prepared for some violations; we even have
to be prepared for some casualties, although I think
our people have trained and planned as hard against
problems for this mission as they ever have for any.
 
But that would not cause me to withdraw. If -- I
believe that NATO would determine, if all the
factions decided they wanted to go fight again, that
there was no longer a mission to perform.
 
Q Switching a little bit to the defense authorization
bill -- you have said you are going to veto it. The
bill includes a pay raise and a housing allowance
increase for military people. Since some of them are
headed off to Bosnia, are you concerned that not
getting the pay raise, not getting the housing
allowance increase would be detrimental to morale?
And is there some alternative? 

THE PRESIDENT: Very much. Yes, there is an
alternative. The Congress could send me a separate
bill with the pay raise and the allowances in it and
I would sign it in a heartbeat. I think, indeed I
hope that they will do one of two things -- I hope
they will either do that, or when I veto this bill,
assuming my veto would be sustained, which I believe
it would because there are some unconstitutional
restrictions on the President's authority as
Commander in Chief in this bill which compels me to
veto it -- so they can either send me the pay raise
and the allowance increase in a separate bill, or
they could delete the offending portions of the
defense authorization bill and send it right back to
me. They can do either one of those things. And I
would hope the Congress would promptly act to do
that.
 
I do not want any erosion of morale and spirit among
not only our people in uniform, but their family
members. I believe that we are completely united in
supporting the full pay raise and the allowance
increase. And I have done my best to budget for these
things over a period of several years.
 
I have visited a large number of our military
facilities, both in the United States and beyond our
borders. I have talked to a lot of people in uniform
about this. And I think it is a very important issue.
If we want to keep the very best people in our
military, we're going to have to see to the
quality-of-life issues. We've allocated a lot of
money for it over the next budget cycle, and I want
to release it, starting with these two issues.
 
Q Mr. President, on a slightly longer-term budget
issue, the Republican seven-year budget plan, while
it has more money for defense in the first couple of
years, actually targets less money towards defense
spending in the out-years 2000 and beyond. Secretary
Perry said earlier this week that that would force
him into the difficult decision of actually cutting
force structure to pay for modernization.
 
You've talked a lot about social spending in the
budget debate, but I haven't heard you talk much
about defending defense spending. Is that something
you're willing to give away to get a deal?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say that I still hope
that I can work with Congress in a way that that
choice won't be necessary. It is true that they
front-loaded more defense spending than we did, which
made it very attractive to all the people who wanted
it in these years. But what we tried to do was to
have a balanced commitment. 
 
I think the worst thing that can happen to the
military is to be jerked around with these up and
down budgets and unpredictability. What we tried to
do is to get our folks together here and to say,
okay, what do we need over the next five years; what
do we need over the next seven years. The only thing
I can say to you, and I would say with some sense of
assurance is that our political system has shown a
willingness now to respond if there's a problem
created for our forces in uniform and for our
national defense.
 
I mean, I think -- one of the things you see that in
the last three years is we've had a remarkable
bipartisan ability to maintain a strong defense as a
part of our continuing engagement in the post-Cold
War world. And I think that everyone knows that the
military went through a significant downsizing with a
remarkable maintenance of excellence and morale, and
that now we have to sustain the system that we have
created. 
 
And so I would say to our forces, I'm going to get
the very best budget agreement I can. I hope we can
get an agreement. But if there is an alarming tailoff
in years six and seven I think it can be corrected in
the future. And I believe if we balance the budget,
get interest rates down, the economy will grow more
quickly. And one of the big differences between me
and the Republican Congress is that they have now
given me an economic plan which says if we do
everything they want, at the end of six or seven
years, interest rates and unemployment will be higher
than they are now. I find that very hard to believe.
I think that we're going to be better off, not worse
off if we do this, and we'll have more money,
therefore, to invest in defense.
 
So I would not worry too much about the out-years.
Whatever happens in this budget agreement, at least
as long as I am here -- and I can't conceive of
anyone else coming into this job, or anyone coming
into control of the Congress that would not try to
sustain a long-term plan for the military, because
that's what we've learned -- that if the military has
a plan they can do nearly anything, but we can't jack
around the plan. And we don't want to play games with
people's lives or with the national security. 

Q Mr. President, can I jump back to Bosnia for a
second and politics? How important do you consider
the success of the Bosnia operation to your own
political prospects? Is it a defining moment for you?
And secondly, from a tactical point of view, would
you mind if Senator Dole was the first senior
political presence in Bosnia on Christmas?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me answer the first
question. If you look at recent American history, the
evidence is that the success of the Bosnia operation
may not have much to do with the election in 1996,
but the failure of the Bosnia operation or the
sustaining of significant casualties could have a
great deal to do with it in a negative way. And
that's all. The conventional political wisdom is why
would the President do this; there's no up side and
tons of down side?
 
But I have to say, when you take a job, you have to
do what you -- you have to do the job. And to be
President at the edge of the 21st century, in a time
of dramatic, dramatic change in the way we work and
live and relate to each other, means that you can't
predict the future, and you just have to do what you
think is right. So for me, this was not -- once I
became convinced we could train for this mission,
that we could define the mission in the peace
agreement, that we could minimize the risks to our
troops, then the decision to me was not so difficult,
no matter what the political down side, because I
believe, in a time like this, you have to ask
yourself which decision would your rather defend 10
years from now when you're not in office if it goes
wrong? 
 
I would much rather explain to my child and my
grandchildren why the United States tried to stop
slaughter, prevent the spread of the war, maintain
NATO instead of destroy it, maintain the leadership
of the United States in the world for peace and
freedom. I would much rather explain why we tried to
do that than why, because of the short-term political
problems, we permitted the war to resume, it
expanded, NATO's alliance was destroyed, and the
influence of the United States was compromised for 10
years. 

I think it's obvious if you look at it that way --
what do you want to tell your grandchildren 10 years
from now -- that the United States is doing the right
thing. And the political risk is part of the price
you pay for being President. Anybody who doesn't want
to take any political risk at a time like this should
not run for the job.
 
Now, in terms of who goes to Bosnia when, I don't
think we should politicize it. Senator Dole and I
worked together to get the support that the Senate
gave to this mission. He expressed his reservations
about it, but he supported my decision as
Commander-in-Chief. I appreciated that. And
obviously, at the appropriate time, I have no
objection to either Senator Dole or anyone else, for
that matter, going to Bosnia.
 
The question is, when is the appropriate time. If I
had my way I would be spending Christmas Eve and
Christmas morning there. That's what I wanted to do.
But our commanders made it clear that when a
President comes into Bosnia, if I fly into that
airport at Tuzla, and then I go down to Sarajevo when
they're in the middle of this deployment, it would be
exceedingly disruptive. So even though I wanted to go
there to say to the American people I believe this
mission is on the right track, and most importantly,
to support the troops and to reassure their families,
I'm taking the advice of the military commanders. I
do not want to interrupt this mission. 

The mission's success is the most important thing.
And that's what I believe should guide everyone. I
think everyone -- there are different levels of
disruption that different trips would cause, and I
think we ought to try to just keep it nonpolitical. I
hope anybody that wants to go there that has a reason
to go, including Senator Dole, will be able to go at
the appropriate time. And that's the determination
that needs to be made.
 
Q Mr. President, you mentioned the safety of the
troops as being part of your decision a couple times
in that last answer. We're sending quite a large
force involved in the Bosnia mission. Some might say,
awfully large for a peaceful mission. How extensive
do you think the danger is to our troops there?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think there is -- let's look
at what the sources are. No one can -- the extent of
the danger depends on factors that we can't fully
predict. But I believe that we have minimized the
risks -- what are the possible problems. First of
all, if you look at what the United Nations went
through over the last four years, I think something
over 200 people lost their lives in Bosnia. But more
than half of them lost their lives in accidents. So
we have really worked hard to train against
accidents, to prepare -- to look at the roadways, to
look at the railways, to look at the airfields. We've
worked hard to minimize the loss of life or serious
injury due to accidents.
 
Then we know there are a lot of land mines there. I
got a very encouraging report today that the parties
themselves in many places are assisting us in
removing the mines. But there are a lot of places
where there are a lot of mines laid where the land
was first in one hands and then another, where we
don't have records of the mines, where people don't
have memories of them. So we have trained very hard
to deal with land mines. I think that's the next
biggest danger after accidents.
 
Then the third problem is people who fought in that
war who are either from the country or who came in
from without the country who may have either a
specific grudge against the United States or, more
likely, will just be frustrated because they don't
agree with the peace agreement that the leaders made,
and therefore, some -- and then, fourthly, there is
just the possibility of encounters that go wrong. The
only casualty we sustained in Haiti had nothing to do
with opposition to our being there. It was a man who
was literally a common criminal who ran through a
barrier, and there was an incident and he shot one of
our soldiers dead. 

So I would say that those are the dangers in order. 

Q Mr. President, I think that's all the time we have. 

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you and merry Christmas. I
appreciate what you do.

of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 6:10 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Hi. I wanted to appear briefly with my
colleagues here and give you a very short update
based on the guidance that we just got from the
budget principals, who obviously continue their hard
work in the Cabinet Room, sleeves rolled up, sheets
of paper flying back and forth, and coffee being
produced in copious quantities. I'm doing my color
since I don't have much substance to report.
 
Q How many --

Q Was it being consumed in copious quantities? 

MR. MCCURRY: The President, the Majority Leader, the
Speaker, the minority leaders and the others
participating agreed that they would work about
another hour tonight. They are working through a
series of difficult budget issues, but they clearly
are very serious about addressing those issues that
are on the table. They expect to work about another
hour tonight, take a break. 

The budget advisors group, which consists of Mr.
Panetta, Chairman Domenici, Chairman Kasich, and the
two ranking members -- Mr. Sabo and Mr. Exon -- will
reconvene on the Hill at approximately 8:00 p.m. or
roughly a half hour after they conclude here. They
will continue to do the type of work that they did
today, working through some of the issues that
they're attempting to analyze for the benefit of the
principals. And then, according to the President and
the others, they expect to reconvene tomorrow as
early as possible based on the advice they get from
the budget advisors who will meet later this evening.
We don't have a time or --
 
Q The principals?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The principals will meet again tomorrow.
We don't have a time set, although the preference is
to begin as early in the morning as they can based on
however late the advisors group works tonight. 
 
That's about all I am afraid I can report at this
point. By agreement, we're not going to attempt to
summarize any of the substance. As one participant
said, we obviously wouldn't be continuing to meet if
we thought it was going poorly. But other than that,
I don't want to characterize any --
 
Q -- no chance that the House or Senate would take up
the proposals that they mentioned in --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I really don't want to speak to that. I
think it would be more appropriate for you to direct
that to either the Speaker's or the Majority Leader's
-- but if you want -- 

Q Are there any plans for the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think you know the President's view.
The President's view is that it would be good to get
the federal government up and running, federal
workers back at their desk. 

Q But what about back pay?
 
Q But wait a minute, wait a minute. Can we get them
to answer the question of whether the House or Senate
will take up the issue tonight of --
 
MR. BLANKLEY: It has to be taken up in the Senate
first -- 
 
Q Could you go to the mike?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Sure. I like that. (Laughter.)
 
MR. MCCURRY: Don't get used to it. (Laughter.) 

MR. BLANKLEY: It would have to be taken up in the
Senate first, and it's not clear whether the Senate
Democrats would be supportive. So we have to be
checking on that before we can move it --
 
Q Why wouldn't they?
 
Q They voted for it last time.
 
Q Why wouldn't they?
 
Q Is this because of the expedited --
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Well, it's not clear. That may be an
issue. So we're still checking.
 
Q What about the House?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: It will have to start in the Senate, so
we can't get out of the Senate.
 
Q But as of now, it is still the plan of the
leadership to try to push it through both chambers --
 
Q Tonight?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: We're trying to, but as I said, it
would have to start with the Senate. You need
unanimous support on both sides of the aisle there.
 
Q The Senate is still --
 
Q What is it that you would try --
 
Q I don't get this --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Would you guys calm down? One of you at
a time will ask a question.
 
Q What are you trying to put through tonight in the
Senate?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: What the Speaker mentioned earlier at
the photo op, which is to have basically the
provision that passed in the Senate last week, which
is attached to the Middle East act, that would bring
-- designate all government employees essential and
would not pay them, but would guarantee their pay
once there is a government up and running again, and
would also have an expedited procedure rule for the
Senate so that we could get whatever agreement we get
out of here moved to the Senate with alacrity. And
there's some speculation that the Senate Democrats
may not want to consent to unanimity on that point.
 
Q Do you know what the state of play in the Senate
is?
 
MR. HINE: The Senate is still in session, prepared to
deal with it, and Senator Dole may have more to say
on the floor once we're done here.
 
Q Logistically, Mike, what would you anticipate that
will happen at the end of the principals meeting?
Would you come out and say something or will they
return to the Hill, have -- 

Q Yes, what happens in an hour?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We did not cover that point. We will
either provide another brief readout which will not
be much different from this readout, or
alternatively, have some type of joint statement as
we did at the conclusion of the meeting last Friday. 

Q You wouldn't expect an appearance by the principals
here?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't expect an appearance by them
here, and I'm not aware of any plans by the
Republican leaders or the Democratic leaders to
attempt to do any type of readout tonight on meetings
or make any type of comment. There obviously -- this
is a work in progress, and the work will continue
tomorrow.
 
MR. HALLEY: On the continuing resolution -- I work
for Senator Daschle -- when this bill comes up, the
Democrats will object because of the fast track
procedures that are being attached to it that would
affect consideration of any budget bill. But at the
same time, we will offer a clean continuing
resolution to fully open the government, as we've
been trying to do for days. So the one that is being
considered by the Republicans, we will object to that
because of the expedited procedures that have been
attached to it. But we will offer a clean continuing
--
 
Q Does that mean you won't give unanimous consent
tonight to that?
 
MR. HALLEY: That's correct.
 
Q What's wrong with the expedited procedure? 

MR. HALLEY: It violates basically most of the
procedures of the Senate in terms of amendments and
debate, et cetera.
 
Q But hold on for a second. Didn't you vote for
something just like this before Christmas --
 
MR. HALLEY: No, that was the Middle East part of it.
There's three parts to this thing that's being put --
 
Q No, we're talking about just calling all the
workers essential. Do you have an objection to that?
 
Q That passed last Friday evening.
 
MR. HALLEY: No. There are three pieces to the thing
that are being put together by the Republicans. One
is deeming workers to be essential, which we agree
with that. Two is the Middle East initiative, which
we agree with that. What we will be objecting to is
the legislating of expedited procedures to -- that
would harm our ability to both amend and debate the
budget bill. And so we will object to that vehicle,
but then we will offer a clean continuing resolution
to open the government.
 
Q Well, when you mean a clean continuing resolution
do you mean to --
 
Q -- what the prospects for that?
 
Q Michael, what's the White House position on this
legislation with the three parts? Do you support the
Senate Democrats or the House --

MR. MCCURRY: The President indicated that, earlier
today, he wants federal workers back at their desks
and working. He wants the services of the government
available to the American people. And we understand
that there will have to be discussions on Capitol
Hill to make that happen quickly. We hope that that
will happen as quickly as possible.
 
Q In other words, he sides with the Republicans, not
the Democrats on this?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. In other words, I very artfully
ducked the question. (Laughter.) 
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Let me just point out that the
provision that apparently the Senate Democrats are
going to block is the same expedited procedure that
you have on a reconciliation bill. And, obviously,
their concern would be that they wouldn't -- it would
get an agreement here that certain Democratic
senators might not be able to destroy the agreement
by a filibuster on the floor after the members here
have worked it out. So there's -- that's a procedural
question.
 
Q Tony, the Speaker is still against a clean CR, is
that not correct?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Listen, I want John to do -- and this is
-- our purpose here is -- my colleagues are here to
give you an update on the meeting that's going on
here. I think if they want to talk about the
procedural issues, which are important, and the
rights of individual senators to raise points, which
the White House acknowledges is a very important part
of the procedure on Capitol Hill, they should really
brief you up on Capitol Hill about those procedures.
 
Q But he has the right of rebuttal.
 
MR. HALLEY: Yes, thank you. But to restate, the
Democrats, as we've tried to do for weeks, are fully
supportive of opening the government and fully
supportive of that -- the piece of this, which is to
deem workers as essential. And so that's not the
issue.
 
The reason we'd be objecting to this procedural
notion is, again, because it would deny the ability
to amend and debate fully. And as we did in 1990,
there is a way to reestablish a reconciliation bill.
As you may recall, in 1990 after the agreement was
reached, we did another budget resolution that would
then trigger a reconciliation bill under the full
procedures of reconciliation. And so that option is
open to us. And we felt that, therefore, we did not
need to run around completely the entire budget
process with something that we'd do this evening.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay, anything more on the meeting going
on now before we exit?
 
Q Yes, Mike. Does the President intend or feel he
will need to before Senator Daschle and Senator Exon
leave the White House tonight, make the point to them
that apparently if everything is so close to
reopening the government, they should set aside --
does he intend to have a separate thing with them,
saying set aside your objection to this; I really
want you to do it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he has such good working relations
with them that I don't think he feels that there's a
need to cover that point.
 
Q There were briefings on the Hill earlier about the
areas that were covered at the budget advisory
report, or whatever it's called. Can you say whether
the leaders here essentially worked within that
framework? Did they go in it or out of it or -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Based on what I know -- I don't have a
complete readout of their entire discussions tonight.
They did review some of those issues that the
advisers dealt with today. They also moved into what
are referred to in their argot now as the tier three
issues, which are more difficult issues that are --
where the differences are more fundamental between
the sides.
 
Q Which one? Medicaid --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm just not -- we're not authorized to
get into the substance of their dialogue.
 
Q Mike, can you explain what the benefit would be of
this piece of legislation that's having its
difficulties this evening? It sounds as though what
you're talking about doing is essentially bringing
260,000 people back who then will join a bunch of
other people who aren't getting paychecks. They'll
all be getting their paychecks, there still will be
money for their designated agencies to --
 
MR. MCCURRY: We would prefer, obviously, any type of
continuing resolution that would reopen the
government. That's been the President's view all
along. We believe the government should be open. We
have believed for a long time there should be a clean
CR that would do so. But we're dealing, and we have
to be realistic about the environment we're dealing
with. And these gentlemen can speak better than I can
on the attitudes on the Hill. 
 
On the other hand, the effective legislation that
would except federal employees who are currently
furloughed from the furlough would be to incur a
legal obligation to pay them. That legal obligation
would be very useful to federal workers that need any
type of short-term loan to make mortgage payments or
who can produce that as evidence to a creditor that
they got the ability to pay bills that are due. I
think that would be at least some comfort to federal
workers. It would be far better for them to get a
paycheck, far better for them to go back to work, far
better for them to provide services to the American
people. That at least it's something, and something
is better than nothing.
 
Q So you don't mind if they try to amend -- they
block the ability to amend the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: As I just heard, that -- I could tell
from their discussion, that's way over my head. I
think there is some work, clearly, that Congress will
have to do on this. The President's view he stated
very clearly earlier; he would like to see those
federal workers back to work as quickly as possible. 

Q Any guidance beyond talks tomorrow?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I don't have anything for the days
beyond that or what time they might finish tomorrow,
or would they finish in time for various people to
make travel plans. I don't have any guidance on that.
 
Q How are you going to let us know, Mike, if they're
going to meet and what time in the morning? All-call
or -- 

MR. MCCURRY: We will do an all-call tomorrow and also
put in on the recording as soon as we know what the
time is. But I would check in here. I think the
President still plans to do the radio address live
tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., so you will -- at
least at that point --
 
Q Live from the talks?
 
Q You wouldn't expect it before the radio address,
would you, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, let me amend that. Just in
case they want to start earlier, if they end up
deciding they want to start earlier, there's some
chance that we might have to pretape the radio
address earlier in the morning. So check here
tomorrow morning.
 
Q What is it going to be on?
 
Q If Senator Dole give the rebuttal, will he do that
live --
 
Q Pass the mike around the table.
 
Q Is he going to do that from here?
 
MR. HINE: I think we're operating under the same
conditions that Mike on that. It's entirely possible
--
 
Q Mike, just to clarify -- you're not suggesting that
this measure that's being conducted this evening
would restore the government to full functioning.
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, it would -- our understanding is it
would allow federal workers to return to their work,
it would allow them to do certain accepted activity
that would be authorized by their individual
agencies. That would be some progress. It would allow
in some cases, my understanding is, for applications
to be processed. For example, one example is it's
conceivable to me under this legislation, unless my
colleagues disagree, that they might be able to begin
issuing passports again for people who wish to
travel, just as one example. 
 
Now, that's an activity that doesn't incur any
additional obligation to spend money on the part of
the government, but it allows some measure of
government services to be restored to the American
people. And that would be better than nothing, as I
said earlier.
 
Q Can you open the national parks under this? 

MR. MCCURRY: I don't know the answer to that. I don't
know the answer.
 
Q Sometime this evening could you get us a reaction
to -- the President's reaction to the Senate
Democrats stopping that process that you just
outlined?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think I commented on that already.
They didn't say they were stopping it --
 
MR. HALLEY: We're not. We're -- 
 
MR. MCCURRY: They've got a plan to reopen the
government by a clean continuing resolution, which is
something, as you know, the President is strongly
supportive of.
 
Q What's the chance of getting a clean CR? 

Q Do you have any idea what the mood is in the room? 

MR. MCCURRY: Unless my colleagues would dispute this
characterization, they clearly are very serious in
purpose. As I said, many of them have their coats
off, they've got their sleeves rolled up, they've got
pens out and --
 
Q Why didn't they do that before?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- they're working very seriously on the
relevant issues.
 
Q Is the Senate essentially in town?
 
MR. HINE: Yes, we're in session. We're in recess
subject to the call of the chair. 
 
Q So if there had to be a roll call -- you don't
expect a roll-call vote tomorrow, for example? If the
majority found it necessary to have a roll-call vote
to tamp down the Democrats thinking --
 
MR. HINE: I'm not certain that that's how events are
going to unfold.
 
Q Mike, why couldn't all of this have been done
Tuesday or Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tuesday or Wednesday -- you mean earlier
in this week? The process that was defined by the
principals last Friday, a week ago today, called for
the staff-level discussions and analysis to begin on
Tuesday and Wednesday, which occurred. It clearly was
very useful for that to happen because it's been the
premise for a lot of the work that occurred today,
and that the principals are doing now.
 
There was an alternative procedure that had been
discussed a while back. That was not available to the
President or the principals for reasons everyone in
this room knows. This is the process that was
available. This is the process that at the moment
appears to be working. 
 
Q A question for John, just to clear up the Senate
action. Does the Senate action -- say, it happened
tonight or tomorrow -- does that have to be by
unanimous consent, or can there be a vote on it,
which presumably could override the Democrats'
objection? And then could the Democrats, say,
filibuster to prevent a vote?
 
MR. HALLEY: No -- I mean, our intent is to -- I mean,
you would need consent at this time of day. Again,
our intent -- we've tried I'd say 10 times in the
last two weeks to pass a continuing resolution that
would open the government, and that's our position.
 
Q A continuing resolution, not just this deeming
measure? 
 
MR. HALLEY: Right.
 
Q You're talking about a real, live CR?
 
MR. HALLEY: Right, a complete opening. A real, live
put-people-back-to-work and pay them, and open the
agencies. 

MR. MCCURRY: This meeting will be over before the
briefing ends if we don't move on.
 
Q John, can you spell your last name?
 
MR. HALLEY: H-a-l-l-e-y.
 
Q Any idea when you might be able to give us some
guidance about Hilton Head?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It won't be tonight, and it will be late
in the day tomorrow. I just don't have any way to
give you any guidance.
 
Q Can you say how early could these talks -- 7:00
a.m.-8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I believe that will depend entirely on
how late Mr. Panetta, the chairman and the
congressional group works this evening. I think their
intent is to work rather late and that might make the
start not at the crack of dawn, but somewhat around
mid-morning tomorrow.
 
Q At 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.?
 
MR. MCCURRY: And then I would suspect that the
President and the other principals would commence
shortly after that. So I don't -- my guess is around
mid-morning, but we'll wait and see and give you
guidance as we've got it.
 
Q Tomorrow the principals meeting would be back here,
not at the Capitol?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It sounded to me like the intent is to
meet here.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Letter from Pres. to Speaker of
House of Reps & Pres. pro tempore of Senate

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Text of a letter from the
President to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives and the President pro tempore of the
Senate
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

December 21, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. President:)

I last reported to the Congress on December 6, 1995,
concerning U.S. support for the United Nations and
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) efforts to
bring peace to the former Yugoslavia. In that report
I noted the success of our diplomatic efforts at
Dayton, Ohio, to assist the parties to reach a
negotiated settlement to the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia and reported the deployment of a NATO
"enabling force" and U.S. support forces in order to
lay the groundwork for the deployment of the main
body of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR). I
am now able to report that on December 14, 1995, the
peace agreement that was initialed in Dayton was
formally signed in Paris.
 
Following the formal signing of the peace agreement
by all the parties, and consistent with our
consultations with the Congress, United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1031, and the North
Atlantic Council (NAC) decision of December 16, 1995,
I have ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000
U.S. military personnel to participate in the IFOR in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, principally
in a sector surrounding Tuzla. Approximately 5,000
U.S. military personnel will also deploy as part of
the IFOR in other states of the former Yugoslavia,
principally Croatia. The IFOR, including U.S. forces
assigned to it, will be under NATO operational
control and will operate under NATO rules of
engagement. In addition, a total of approximately
7,000 U.S. support forces, under U.S. command and
control and rules of engagement, will deploy in
Hungary, Croatia, Italy, and other states in the
region in support of IFOR. These force levels are
those stated by U.S. commanders to be appropriate for
the missions assigned to them. 

The IFOR's mission, as outlined in more detail in the
summary of the operation plan (OPLAN), which I sent
to the Congress on December 11, 1995, is to monitor
and help ensure compliance by all parties with the
military aspects of the peace agreement. In
particular, IFOR will ensure withdrawal of the forces
of the parties to the agreed inter-entity borders
within an agreed period and enforce establishment of
agreed zones of separation between forces of the
parties. IFOR will also create secure conditions for
the safe, orderly, and speedy withdrawal from the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of those elements
of the U.N. Protection Force not assigned to NATO.
Finally, within the strict limits of its key military
tasks, IFOR will endeavor to create secure conditions
for the conduct by other agencies and organizations
of tasks associated with the peace agreement. NATO
and U.S. military commanders believe, and I expect,
that the military mission can be accomplished in
about a year. 

Many of the U.S. forces that will deploy to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be drawn from
the U.S. Army's lst Armored Division stationed in
Germany, including two mechanized brigades and an
aviation brigade. Other participating U.S. forces
include special operations forces, airfield
operations support forces, naval and air forces
previously assigned to support NATO's Operations
Sharp Guard and Deny Flight, and an amphibious force
in reserve in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, a
carrier battle group will provide support for IFOR's
air operations.
 
All of our NATO allies are contributing forces as
well (except for Iceland, which has no military).
Non-NATO nations whose offers to provide forces to
IFOR are under consideration include Austria, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia, Sweden, and Ukraine. These forces also will
be under NATO operational control and rules of
engagement. In total, approximately 60,000 military
personnel are expected to be deployed by IFOR to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the U.S.
case, the non-U.S. contingents in Bosnia will in most
cases be supported by forces of their respective
countries at home and in nearby countries and waters.
 
I authorized these deployments and U.S. participation
in IFOR in conjunction with our NATO allies and other
troop contributing nations following the relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions and NAC decisions
and as part of our commitment to secure the peace and
halt the tragic loss of life in the former
Yugoslavia. I have directed the participation of U.S.
forces pursuant to my constitutional authority to
conduct the foreign relations of the United States
and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. 

I am providing this report as part of my effort to
keep the Congress fully informed about developments
in the former Yugoslavia, consistent with the War
Powers Resolution. I remain committed to consulting
closely with the Congress and I will continue to keep
the Congress fully informed regarding these important
deployments of our forces.
 
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 7:25 P.M. EST
 
MR. MCCURRY: Second verse, same as the first. Bye.
(Laughter.)
 
Q Do you know now how the President feels about the
Democratic move in the Senate?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President believes that we'll able
to work -- given the cooperation shown today, we can
work something out that will allow federal workers to
resume their diligent service to the American people.
 
Q Tonight?
 
Q What's that mean?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be up to senators and leaders on
the Hill to resolve those issues, but we hope they
will.
 
Q Well, does he agree that the Democrats have a
point?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He understands the concerns the senators
have to make sure they've got the right protected to
debate very important budget matters and the very few
hours of hearings and debate devoted to aspects of
the Republican budget. And he well understands why
people are protecting the right to have further
debate. At the same time, he will encourage all
members of Congress from both parties to act quickly
to allow federal workers to return to their posts.
 
Q Mike, when you say work something out, does the
President -- is the President given to understand
that there will be something done today or tomorrow
to work something out to return furloughed federal
employees back to the job -- to their jobs? 

MR. MCCURRY: The sense the President got is that
congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle are
working urgently to solve the matter.
 
Q -- conciliatory to me.
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- let me tell you what I know about
tonight. They're taking a break. Mr. Panetta and his
group from the White House will return to Capitol
Hill, begin meeting with the so-called budget
advisers group, approximately 8:00 p.m. It's my
understanding they do not plan any further readouts
this evening. They are continuing to work through
issues that they then prepare for discussion by the
budget advisers. I anticipate that staffs are going
to be working throughout the evening and into the
morning to prepare discussion documents that will be
used by the principals tomorrow. They've agreed to
reconvene here at the White House at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow. That's the principals group.
 
Q How does that affect the radio address? Still be
done live?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The radio address is going to be done
taped just to protect -- make sure we don't have any
-- because the President may be involved in
pre-briefs prior to the meeting. 

Q What's the subject?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be about the budget.
 
Q When will that be available, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's taping it tomorrow morning, and we
expect it will be available just shortly before air
time.
 
Q Mike, the Republicans all left tonight without
comment. Did the meeting end in an atmosphere of --
 
MR. MCCURRY: It ended very amicably. And the
President, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the
Democratic leaders agreed that the readout that you
heard earlier this evening would suffice for the work
that they did between roughly 6:00 p.m. and 7:20 p.m.
 
Q -- resolution tomorrow, Mike? What does it look
like?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Say again.
 
Q For the prospects of a resolution tomorrow. 

MR. MCCURRY: A resolution -- you mean a resolution of
issues or --
 
Q Yes.
 
MR. MCCURRY: They will make progress tomorrow, but I
don't -- the work they're doing, it would be very
hard at this point to predict that they would arrive
at any final agreements tomorrow. They've got a lot
of work to do tomorrow.
 
Q Do you this going, then, into Sunday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Conceivably, yes. But that's not been
decided yet.
 
Q Do you have a reaction from the President to the
Daschle blocking this plan that --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, we talked about that earlier. 

Q Is there a meeting with Panetta and the budget
advisers tomorrow morning before the principals
meeting? There was some talk about a 9:00 a.m.
meeting on the Hill before the principals came down
here. Was there any talk about that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They may -- the budget advisers group
may reconvene tomorrow morning, but they -- that
would be prior to the 10:30 a.m. meeting --
 
Q Why did the President cut off a reporter from
asking Gingrich whether he had caved?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President -- (inaudible) -- felt
that there had been any indication by the Speaker
that he had, quote, unquote, caved -- (inaudible) --
the President also thought he might give a better
answer than the Speaker might. (Laughter.)
 
Q What?
 
Q He wants peace to reign.
 
Q -- single issue was set aside as agreed upon or
anything narrowed substantially --
 
MR. MCCURRY: The procedure they've been using for
these discussions is that any element discussed and
any element that they reach consensus upon would not
change the admonition that nothing is finally agreed
until everything is agreed.
 
Q Your sense, Mike, about any travel plans the
President may have that could be tomorrow or more
likely Sunday now? 

MR. MCCURRY: I have no sense, but the President
seemed to be enjoying himself here as much as he
would in South Carolina. (Laughter.)
 
Q You have no sense of that?
 
Q -- answer to that question that nothing is agreed
until everything is agreed -- what you're saying is,
whatever differences they narrow today have no
permanent status because everything has to be agreed
to or--
 
MR. MCCURRY: As a common negotiating device, they
usually -- even as they work through complicated
issues, that they reserve the right at the end of the
discussion to go back and look at the entire package.
And they have done so here, and I suspect they will
continue to do so -- that they will go back and look
at the final package that they get, if they in fact
get one, before they agree that they've got a final
agreement.
 
Q But you -- as you agree, you guys are just checking
it off and moving on to the next one, and then --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, but what they're doing -- they're
doing -- I mean, without getting into the substance,
because I'm not authorized to get into the substance,
they are working through a set of issues that have
been identified. The budget advisers today met, dealt
with a series of budget issues, not all of them, but
many of them. They were analyzed in some detail,
discussions papers were prepared. They were reviewed
today. The budget advisers will now go back up to the
Hill, continue to address elements of the budget
discussion. They will be analyzed, discussion drafts
will be prepared, and they'll work again on it
tomorrow. They're taking these issues serially as
they work through a series of contentious issues that
range from the -- starting with the less
controversial and moving to the more controversial.
And they clearly now are moving into areas that are
more controversial.
 
Q On the Hill tonight do you think there will be
action to get the workers back to work?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I cannot predict that. You've heard the
discussion of the representatives and the
congressional leadership earlier, and it will be up
to them to --
 
Q Mike, are there going to be simultaneous meetings
with the budget leaders up on the Hill, meeting at
the same time that the meetings down here are taking
place, or do they complete -- 

Q I think Tony Blankley said --
 
Q He did indicate -- Tony indicated that they'd be up
on the Hill, you know, working on churning stuff out
even for future issues -- even as --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Oh, yes, they have -- well, we have --
there have been staff -- staff work has continued
even while the principals are meeting, yes. In fact,
there's some -- staff has been available in the
Roosevelt Room in case there is a need for expert
advice on budget related issues, and they continue.
 
Q With Cabinet-level people? Will they be meeting
also at the same --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I wouldn't rule it out, but mostly the
people who are there are more staff level experts.
 
Q -- radio address subject?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be the budget situation
generally. It will also be, because it's the last
radio address of the year, it will be a review of
1995.
 
Q Mike, unrelated, is the policy out here changed at
all, or was that just a mis --
 
MR. MCCURRY: That was a regrettable misunderstanding,
and I believe we have got meetings going on right now
to straighten out --
 
Q That's not the first time it's happened today. It's
happened several times. 
 
MR. MCCURRY: I understand, and there's --
 
Q Some people decided not to provoke a fight and -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Right. They're working to clarify what
the ground rules are on -- (inaudible) -- because
they obviously -- 

Q Is the President going out tonight?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Say again.
 
Q Is the President going out tonight?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Not that I'm aware of. Is he? He is?
Pool alert -- that he may go out for dinner
apparently. 
 
Q Where?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay, see you all tomorrow.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Agricultural income
and finance

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Agricultural income and finance
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:271295

Net Farm Income May Rise in 1996, While Net Cash
Income Declines 
Net farm income is forecast at $37-$47 billion for
1996, compared with the $39 billion forecast for
1995. Both forecasts are below the 1990-94 average of
$44 billion. Expected high crop cash receipts and a
forecast increase in inventories of unsold feed
grains underpin the 1996 forecast. Net cash income is
forecast at $43-$53 billion, compared with $51
billion forecast for 1995. An important reason why
the net farm income forecast is generally upward and
the forecast for net cash income is generally
downward is that, in contrast to net farm income, net
cash income excludes changes in inventory. The degree
and direction by which inventories change can swing
widely depending on production and marketing
patterns.

Cash receipts from farm marketings are projected at
$184-$192 billion in 1996, up from the $184 billion
forecast for 1995. Both forecasts would be a record;
the previous high was $180 billion in 1994. Expected
large feed grain production and strong feed grain
prices stemming from tight world supplies explain
much of the higher 1996 forecast. Livestock receipts
are expected to remain flat.

Direct government payments for 1996 are forecast at
$3-$5 billion, while the 1995 forecast is for $6
billion. Expected high feed grain prices are the main
reason for the reduced forecast. Projected government
payments for both 1995 and 1996 would be the lowest
in the 1990's.

Total production expense, used to calculate net farm
income, is forecast at $169-$177 billion in 1996, up
from $168 billion in 1995. Part of the forecast
increase is tied to the expected rise in planted
acres. High forecast feed grain prices and fewer
requirements to idle acreage in order to be eligible
for government farm program benefits should encourage
heavy plantings. High feed grain prices could
increase feed expense for livestock producers, which
is of special importance because U.S. cattle numbers
in 1996 could approach the large levels last seen in
the mid-1980's. Higher nitrogen fertilizer prices
could increase costs for crop producers.

The value of agricultural assets is forecast at
$985-$995 billion for 1996, up 3 to 4 percent from
1995. About four-fifths of the increase is due to
rising real estate values. Expanding cash receipts,
generally good returns to assets, and favorable
interest rates are supporting continued growth in
farm sector capital investments. Farm business debt
could rise above $155 billion by the end of 1996, the
highest level since 1986. However, interest expense
could decline, as lower rates offset the rise in
debt. Overall farm debt in 1996 should be about 60
percent of what farm income can support, also the
highest level since 1986.

Given trends developing for 1996--higher crop cash
receipts, flat livestock receipts, smaller government
payments, and slightly lower net cash income: 
* Net cash income could decline proportionally more
on the smallest farms than on the largest ones. The
smallest farms traditionally earn a larger proportion
of their income from livestock sales and government
payments. 

* Farms that specialize in red meat production could
have proportionally larger dips in their net cash
income than other types of farms. Because they depend
on livestock for about 90 percent of their income,
farms specializing in red meat likely will face
higher feed expenses.

* Midwestern farms could have proportionally smaller
declines in their net cash income compared with farms
in other parts of the country. The Midwest is by far
the Nation's largest producer of corn and soybeans,
the crops for which cash receipts are forecast to
increase the most.

A special article in this issue looks at the
financial performance of U.S. farm business in 1994.
USDA's latest Farm Costs and Returns Survey, shows
that even though 1994 saw none of the adverse weather
that decreased production the year before, net income
from farming for the average commercial farm business
was up less than 1 percent. While the year-to-year
variation in average income was not statistically
significant, the composition of net income did
change. Government payments were down significantly.
The reduction in cash expenses offset the decline in
gross cash income and was enough for income to rise
from an average of $37,997 per farm in 1993 to an
average of $38,284 in 1994. In 1994, 6 percent of
commercial farm businesses were in a vulnerable
financial position based on their combined net farm
income and debt-to-asset ratios.

A second special article outlines the issues involved
in accounting for forestry product sales in farm
income estimates.

General's Christmas message
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

We are now approaching the end of what has been a
very important year. It is during this year that we
observed the first anniversary of the birth of our
new democracy - an occasion marked by both
celebration and reflection.

1995 was no less significant a year for all our
people. It give us a glimpse of what the future holds
in store. This years achievements have provided us
with insight into the opportunities that await South
Africa in the coming years. It has at the same-time
given us a better understanding of the magnitude of
the task of reconstruction and development that still
lie ahead.

The African National Congress has always admitted
that no major transformation process can ever succeed
without the solid support of the majority of our
people in their organised formations and sectors. We
shall continue to ensure the constructive involvement
of all these in the reconstruction and development
programme. 

For indeed without their involvement the
reconstruction and development programme will lack
the mass content critical to its realization.

The single issue uppermost in people's minds, which
will continue to impede the effective implementation
of the RDP, and generates a negative perception of
our country in the outside world - is that of crime.
Antisocial behaviour - be it murder, both political
and criminal; car-hijackings; rape; robbery; child
molestation; or some other - must be seriously
addressed and eliminated. The sheer size of the
problem dictates that piecemeal methods will be
ineffective. It requires a comprehensive national
strategy for the prevention of crime. At the core of
such an approach is addressing the root causes of
crime.

The ANC, in government and outside government,
remains firmly committed to creating a safe and
secure environment in which families can bring up
their children; mothers can feel safe in their homes
and on the streets; and breadwinners can go about
their business without fear.

The Government of National Unity has already set in
motion a National Crime Prevention Strategy, linked
to the Community Safety Plan initiated by President
Nelson Mandela. These and other initiatives must
continue to draw the unequivocal support of all our
communities if we are to uproot.

On the economic front, we draw inspiration from the
economic growth and development hitherto unknown in
our country in the past twenty - three years. The
economy is now geared towards servicing the needs,
not of a section but all our people.

The constitution is being shaped by the need to move
from the inequities of the past and towards a climate
of peace, reconciliation and nation - building -
issues so close to our President's heart.

Our country, has effectively been transformed from a
pariah to a darling of nations of the world. We have
now taken our rightful place in all international
platforms: socially, economically, sporting,
cultural, diplomatic and in all other forms of
international relations.

The African National Congress, extends its heartfelt
congratulations to all South Africans who helped
shape the destiny of our country into the envy of the
world. In this season of goodwill we express our
condolences to those who lost their loved ones
throughout this year.

The ANC extends a message of peace and harmony, a
Happy Christmas and Prosperous New Year!

-BELL ATLANTIC: Maryland files rate plan to address
competetion -- Plan caps prices until 1998

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BELL ATLANTIC: Maryland
files rate plan to address competetion -- Plan caps
prices until 1998
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

BALTIMORE, MD -- Bell Atlantic today proposed an
alternative regulatory plan that would regulate Bell
Atlantic's prices rather than the company's earnings.
The plan was filed with the Maryland Public Service
Commission and comes on the heels of legislation
passed earlier this year by the General Assembly
giving the Commission the power to adopt such a
regulatory approach.
 
"Our plan is a logical next step to replace
Maryland's current incentive regulation plan," said
Dan Whelan, president and CEO of Bell Atlantic -
Maryland. "It recognizes the competitive nature of
our industry today. It is pro-consumer,
pro-competition and pro-economic development."
 
Under the plan, services would be divided into five
categories: Access, Basic-Residential, Basic-Other,
Discretionary and Competitive. The Access category
includes services that provide connections to
long-distance networks. Basic-Residential includes
residential dial-tone lines, while Basic-Other
includes business services. Discretionary includes
optional services like Call Waiting, and Competitive
includes services provided by other vendors, such as
Speed Dialing.
 
Under the Bell Atlantic proposal, the rates for
Basic-Residential services would be capped for a
period of two years, and many business services for
one year. After that, rates for these services could
be increased or decreased annually, under a formula
that is based on changes in the Gross Domestic
Product-Price Index. 
 
"Our residential rates have been stable since 1985,
and this plan ensures that this stability will be
maintained," Whelan said. 

The plan is also designed to give Bell Atlantic
additional flexibility in pricing Discretionary and
Competitive services categories. For example, rates
for discretionary services, such as Call Waiting and
Caller ID, could be increased up to 25% annually or
could be reduced at any time, provided rates are not
reduced below costs. Competitive services such as
Speed Dialing, which compete with services offered by
Bell Atlantic's competitors, would be subject to full
pricing flexibility.
 
"This plan preserves the PSC's regulatory authority
to oversee telecommunications in Maryland, and
focuses on prices paid by customers, rather than
regulation of Bell Atlantic's earnings," Whelan said.
"The plan also guarantees that we will follow the
commission's service quality standards and maintains
relevant safeguards, such as pricing services above
costs to prevent anti-competitive behavior." 

Whelan said that Bell Atlantic's plan is also aimed
at keeping Maryland competitive with neighboring
states. Numerous studies have shown that regulatory
policies which allow a company to retain its earnings
can lead to a more aggressive deployment of new
telecommunications services--services that would
support Maryland's economic development goal of
attracting and retaining businesses and jobs. 
 
"Although Maryland is leading the nation in
introducing telecommunications competition, we are
the only state in our region that has not adopted a
more modern regulatory structure. It is therefore
important that we move forward prudently, but
quickly," he added.
 
Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at the
forefront of the new communications, entertainment
and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,
the company is the premier provider of local
telecommunications and advanced services. Globally,
it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth
wireless communications marketplace. Bell Atlantic
also owns a substantial interest in Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing
high-growth national and international business
opportunities in all phases of the industry.

of the Press Secretary --Section 1511 of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
Section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (hereinafter the "Act"),
requires that the sanctions imposed on Serbia and
Montenegro, as described in that section, shall
remain in effect until changed by law. Section
1511(e) of the Act authorizes the President to waive
or modify the application of such sanctions upon
certification to the Congress that the President has
determined that the waiver or modification is
necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to
the parties.
 
In accordance with this provision, I have issued the
attached Presidential Determination stating that the
suspension of the sanctions described in section
1511(a)(1-5) and (7-8) and in conformity with the
provisions of United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 1021 and 1022 is necessary to achieve a
negotiated settlement of the conflict. As described
in the attached Memorandum of Justification, this
sanctions relief was an essential factor motivating
Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and
Herzegovina initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November
21, 1995 (hereinafter the "Peace Agreement").
 
I have directed the Secretaries of the Treasury and
Transportation to suspend immediately the application
of these sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro and have
authorized the Secretary of State to suspend the arms
embargo at appropriate stages consistent with United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1021. The first
stage would be 91 days after the United Nations
Secretary General reports to the United Nations
Security Council that all parties have formally
signed the Peace Agreement.
 
The measures taken to suspend these sanctions may be
revoked if the Implementation Force (IFOR) commander
or High Representative determines that Serbia and
Montenegro or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting their
obligations under the Peace Agreement.

-THE TENAGRA CORPORATION: New year could usher in big
computing problems

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE TENAGRA CORPORATION:
New year could usher in big computing problems
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Brampton, Ontario, Canada -- Peter de Jager is one of
a growing number of computer experts that isn't
looking forward to New Year's day in the year 2000.

That is because 12:00:01 AM, January 1, 2000 could
mark the beginning of a serious problem for many of
the world's computer systems.

Most computers track the date by using a two-digit
notation system. The date January 1, 1996, for
example, would be recorded by a computer as:
01/01/96. This notation system, according to de
Jager, is the problem. 

"The two-digit date notation affects data
manipulation, primarily subtractions and
comparisons," explains de Jager. "For instance, I was
born in 1955. If I ask the computer to calculate how
old I am today, it subtracts 55 from 93 and announces
that I'm 38.

"So far so good. But what happens in the year 2000?
The computer will subtract 55 from 00 and will state
that I am minus 55 years old. This error will affect
any calculation that produces or uses time spans,
such as an interest calculation."

De Jager believes a number of Year 2000 related
problems may well manifest themselves in 1996.

"A large number of business processes, such as credit
cards, operate on a four year cycle. In 1996, it will
be interesting to see if any banks issue credit cards
with '00' as an expiration year. What could happen is
that ATM machines may think that the card expired in
1900 if only '00' is used to signify the year 2000."

While year 2000 problems are often associated with
large computing systems, it will affect desktop
computers as well. Many people that shut off their
personal computers on December 31, 1999 could be
surprised when they turn them on the next day to find
their computer's clock set at January 4, 1980 -
another strange error that experts predict will occur
because of the way internal clocks in computers
handle the rollover to a new year. 

Some experts estimate that the costs of reprogramming
computers to rid them of this flaw in the next four
years could total hundreds of billions of dollars.

Peter de Jager is an industry speaker on the topics
of managing the impact of technological change. He
was the first to actively speak about on the Year
2000 computer crisis to those outside the computer
industry. 

In April, 1995, de Jager partnered with The Tenagra
Corporation to develop the Year 2000 Internet
Information Center (http://www.year2000.com/) - an
Internet web site devoted to raising awareness of the
Year 2000 computer crisis. The web site contains
extensive information on the impending crisis,
including 10 white papers and nine vendors providing
Year 2000 solutions. Individuals visiting the site
can also download a free software patch to help PCs
cope with the date transition.

Founded in 1993, The Tenagra Corporation
(http://arganet.tenagra.com/) is Houston, Texas
company providing Internet marketing, public
relations, consulting and web site development
services.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 3:55 P.M. EST
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay. All clear, right?
 
Q Yeah, right.
 
Q How come there's no meeting until next Friday? What
happened?
 
MR. MCCURRY: As you can tell from our statement, as
--in fact, can I have a copy in my statement so I can
just keep repeating what's in the statement?
(Laughter.)
 
Q We heard the President say that he's willing to
stay every day, work hard and so forth to get an
agreement. What happened?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He is. The key thing -- I'll do an
exegetical of reading this statement for you. The
good meetings that they had today refers to the two
meetings they had. They had a larger meeting in the
Cabinet Room and then the private meeting that the
President had with the Speaker, the Majority Leader,
the two Minority Leaders and Mr. Armey, too, I
believe -- George? Armey was there -- in the Oval
Office.
 
They build on the progress in yesterday's
discussions. That's an important observation because
you will recall that Mr. Panetta and Mr. Domenici and
Mr. Kasich designed a process yesterday by which we
dealt with some of the less controversial issues in
this budget dispute. That generated over a seven-year
period some $40 billion in savings in some of these
secondary areas. That was presented to the principals
today, and I think there was agreement that while
there's nothing agreed until everything is agreed,
that represented some progress and served as a useful
model of how we might resolve some of the larger
issues.
 
So the President and the other leaders agreed that
that process by which staff develops an analysis,
presents it to the budget advisors -- which is the
Panetta, Domenici, Kasich, Sabo, Exon group -- they
ought to work through this analysis beginning right
after the holiday and then present that back to the
principals a week from today, as they just did
yesterday in looking at the issues that they looked
at. And I think that's useful. 
 
There have been different ideas on how we might
advance this discussion, ranging from face-to-face
meetings to whatever, but they had a process, they
designed a process yesterday. It seemed to be
working. I think there was agreement, as you can tell
from this statement, that they ought to continue to
use that process to see if they could make progress
on these other issues.
 
Q No sense of urgency at all?
 
MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of urgency.
 
Q How can you say that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of a sense of urgency. This
President would, above all else, like to see the full
services of the American government restored to the
American people. But everybody in this room knows
that's not going to happen because you've been
following -- presumably, you've been following the
debate in the House and the Senate today. So you just
know where we are on that. 

Now what we are going to do, since we can't get the
full services of the government restored, they are
going to deal with the most urgent situations that
exist. Those range from benefits checks for veterans
to income support checks for children who are
dependent on AFDC, to federal workers who are not
getting their pay. That was an area of very great
concern raised by the President and agreed to by most
of the leaders in the room.
 
And they are looking now at ways in which they might
be able to address that situation, despite the fact
that there doesn't seem to be agreement on Capitol
Hill for a CR that would be fully fund the
government. Everyone here knows that Democrats today
have offered on Capitol Hill clean versions of the CR
that would re-open this government. And you all know
what's happened to those measures. 

Q Well, would it come to a vote at all?
 
Q Mike, at the very least, does this mean that
there's no end in sight for the shutdown, at least
not until next Friday when the next meeting takes
place?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are ways in which we will
attempt to address the consequences of the shutdown.
We will continue our work day by day at OMB to
address the consequences of the shutdown. I believe
you will see as a result of this meeting today on
Capitol Hill efforts by the leaders to address some
of the specific consequences.
 
It certainly appears that there will be some
agreement on trying to get veterans' checks out on
time and trying to get income support payments to
children out on time. But we'll have to deal with the
most urgent consequences of the shutdown on a
day-by-day basis, doing what we can, working with the
Hill and getting legislation passed and doing what we
can do administratively under law as we did in the
last shutdown to address the consequences that
threaten life and health of the American people.
 
Q Well, so, the President -- this is a club over the
President which he is accepting, basically?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. The club over the President that
they tried to swing was to insist upon him tabling a
seven-year balanced budget proposal scored by the CBO
in order to have exactly this type of discussion. And
that did not happen.
 
Q But, Mike, he has repeatedly said he would not
negotiate with a gun to his head, this sort of threat
of shutting down the government. But now he's doing
exactly that.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, it's the result of this
conversation today, while not removed, the gun was
clearly uncocked. 
 
Q Huh?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've taken some of -- whether
it's veterans' benefits or welfare payments or now
we've got some forward movement as a result of this
meeting on the issue of payments to workers who are
furloughed -- they're going to try to work through
some of these issues, and they've instructed staff to
look at ways that they could deal with that.
 
Q -- half-cocked, right?
 
Q Mike, was there a definite agreement that this
meeting today from the Republicans to go ahead and
move through on a limited CR basis all these urgent
matters as they come up? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, it would be better given the
agreement that we've reached not to try to
characterize or spin the results of this meeting, for
you to direct that question to the Republicans.
 
Q And was there agreement to continue to -- 

MR. MCCURRY: The President was encouraged -- the
President raised those as urgent issues, and the
President was encouraged by the response.
 
Q What was the tone of the meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Workman-like. Workperson-like.
 
Q What is the President going to be doing this
weekend?
 
Q Were there any women there?
 
MR. MCCURRY: In other words, they rolled up their --
they did, this was, in fact, exactly a meeting where
they rolled up their sleeves and went to work.
 
Q Did he ask them to open the government and they
refused?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He has done that repeatedly.
 
Q I take it the House is going to go into recess, but
there are different versions of this very narrow --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I cannot help you sort out what's
happening in the House and the Senate. We're
following that and trying to make heads or tails out
of that ourselves, but it's a very fluid situation.
I'd ask your congressional correspondents. 

Q What does the President do this weekend? How does
he advance it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he's confident that those who will
be working through some of the analysis of the issues
will be at work. There will be some staff level work,
but to be candid about it, the budget staffs at both
the CBO and the OMB have been working 24-hour days
for several weeks, and the President is going to give
our OMB staff and economists the Christmas holiday
off. They'll come back after Monday beginning working
on this analysis of issues. They'll present that to
the budget advisors group. That's the Panetta,
Kasich, Domenici, Exon, Sabo group. I expect they
will meet late next week and prepare the agenda and
the discussion for the principals a week from today.
 
Q What is the guidance on what he's going to do? Is
he still going to go to Camp David next week?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Since this is just developing, he
probably was looking for an opportunity to talk to
the First Lady about their plans. His plans are still
to be here through the 26th at least, and then the
option of going to Camp David from the 27th he'll
have to explore. I don't have an answer for you.
 
Q Is Hilton Head out?
 
MR. MCCURRY: If he goes down, I think -- he still has
an interest in going down and having a party with his
friends on New Year's Eve. But I don't know whether
he's going to be able to do that, or not.
 
Q Mike, in today's meeting, did the President ask
them to put the government back to work?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He addressed his concern as he did
publicly for all of you at the -- I mean, the answer
to that, obviously, is yes, because he did it with
all of you present at the beginning of the meeting. I
mean, he stressed that concern, he raised that
concern. They talked about it during the meeting. 

Q And they said no still?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The no came from the action on Capitol
Hill today, as you know.
 
Q Mike, the $40 billion that you talked about, did
the principals all agree to where that was coming
from and did they reach any agreement about where to
put it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- again, I would stress,
because I don't want anyone to misunderstand what the
White House is saying that nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed. They were satisfied they made
some progress on those roughly $40 billion worth of
savings generated by discussions they had on the wide
range of things they dealt with yesterday from
spectrum to banking, to financial, to transportation
issues, some of the other issues that they've dealt
with. That's a useful model. And then that goes into
further discussions. I don't have any detail breakout
of that. I can't specify that, and I won't specify
that.
 
Q Mike, is the President --
 
Q -- there's no Medicaid agreement?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Santa?
 
SANTA CLAUS: Ho-ho-ho-ho.
 
MR. MCCURRY: It's very good to see you.
 
SANTA CLAUS: Merry Christmas.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Merry Christmas. Let's do a couple more
questions, and then I'll turn the podium over to
Santa.
 
Q Is the President comfortable with the way this
thing ended? Would he have preferred more talks
tonight, obviously, on the weekend? Is it just done
now until next Friday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President would prefer to see the
government open, prefer to see the balance -- the
budget balanced now. But we are into a process that
we hope will resolve some of these issues and resolve
some of the differences that exist. These differences
still exist. It's not possible to achieve either of
those objectives today.
 
Q But this timetable is to give everybody a Christmas
at home, isn't it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: This timetable is to allow people to
work through issues that are deeply divided at the
moment and that apparently were not reconcilable
today.
 
Q Was the President willing to work --
 
Q Just one other thing, Mike, on another matter. As
you know, as a result of the compromise, those
Whitewater notes were released, went to the Hill.
Senator D'Amato and others have reacted. What's the
sense here about what the effect of this is? Does it
make things better, make things worse, prolong the
controversy, end it --what?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I concur fully on Mr. Fabiani's
statement. 

Q Mike, just to be clear here, are you saying that
the President was willing to work, but the members of
Congress wanted to go back home? I mean, who was it
who said we shouldn't -- 

MR. MCCURRY: The issue was not the desire to go back
home. The issue was the desire to try to make some
progress on these issues. And they clearly were not
going to write a seven-year balanced budget plan at
this meeting today. That was not in the expectations
for the meeting.
 
Q Well, how about next week?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What they have done is designed a
process by which we can get to that objective. 
 
Let me just take one or two more.
 
Q So the President was unwilling to work on Tuesday.
I just want to find out --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Look, that is not the case. The
President is more than -- would have been willing if
it was some prospect that this would have led to a
successful result to have worked all through the
holiday. That's not going to happen. It was clear in
this meeting that they're not going to bridge these
--
 
Q Well, did they tell him, we won't do it? 

MR. MCCURRY: It's clear that they weren't going to
bridge all the differences that exist and write a
budget that is a very complex document in the course
of a weekend.
 
Q Mike, explain what is the goal here now? Is the
goal to produce, as the Republicans want, as Armey
has said repeatedly, a bill -- a bill in the end that
they send to him that puts the government back to
work and it's a done deal? Or is the goal to get far
enough along to where the Republicans finally give in
and pass a CR? What's -- I mean, it's got to be one
or the other. 

MR. MCCURRY: The goal we have is to see the services
of the government fully restored. We can't achieve
that goal right now. What we can do right now is to
address the most urgent consequences of the
government shutdown. And we will do that, and we
believe today we've got some sense of cooperation
from the leaders in trying to address those most
urgent issues. I cannot predict for you now when the
continuing resolution or full funding or full
appropriations measures will pass that will fully
restore government. But I do know the President is
committed to working towards satisfactory solutions
that deal with the most urgent consequences of the
shutdown. 

Q But does the President believe that a CR will be
passed before there is a final agreement on the
budget deal? 

MR. MCCURRY: The President doesn't rule out that
possibility.
 
Q Mike, a follow-up --
 
Q Why?
 
Q -- do you think that federal workers will get paid?
Some of them have been told to start filing for
unemployment next week.
 
MR. MCCURRY: The one positive thing that came out of
the meeting is it was very clearly on the part of
everyone in the room concern about the status of
federal workers who are furloughed, federal workers
who are working as excepted employees who are not
going to get paid until there is funding. And also --
well, those are the two categories. And they -- in
both categories, there seems to be willingness on the
part of the leadership to explore remedies that would
allow them to be paid despite the shutdown. And that
was encouraging. We don't have an answer to that
problem yet, but there is some agreement that they
will look for ways to try to get paychecks to those
people, especially during this holiday season. 

Q Armey has said that they're not going to have any
votes at least until Wednesday evening, as they were
shutting down on the House floor. Given that you
wouldn't quarrel with the notion that the government
is going to stay shut down at a minimum, at least
until Wednesday night, or at least until Thursday
morning? 

MR. MCCURRY: I would not quarrel with that. I mean,
and he knows the House schedule better. That's
exactly the situation we're in. They're not going to,
despite the efforts by Democrats on the Hill to pass
a continuing resolution today, that's not going to
happen.
 
Q Mike, to follow on, do they go ahead, though, and
apply for unemployment, which will cost the
government even more? 

MR. MCCURRY: They will have to take the best advice
they can get from the Office of Personnel Management,
and they will know best the situation. Federal
workers should contact personnel advisers at their
agencies or look for notices from OPM on how to
handle those circumstances.
 
Q But are they all furloughed? I mean, how do they --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are 470,000 federal workers
who are working now. The federal government is
incurring a legal obligation to pay them. And what we
agree at the very least is that we ought to figure
out how to get paychecks to those people since we are
legally obligated to pay them one way or another. We
also are very concerned about people who are
furloughed. And we encourage that the Republican
leadership on the Hill have pledged to make sure
those people do get their pay restored. And we will
look for ways that we can do that, even advance full
appropriations or a continuing. There's no -- there
was no answer or solution to that problem today, but
there is some willingness to explore a way to deal
with that situation.
 
Q I don't want to go over old ground, but what you
may be hearing from us is you say there's a very
discernable sense of urgency, and yet here both sides
are taking several days off, and no meeting scheduled
until next Friday. And that's hard for us to put the
two and two together and --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there clearly are some divisions
that exist here. You've been hearing them expressed
publicly all day. And having meetings throughout the
weekend that weren't going to resolve those
differences wouldn't be a fruitful exercise. But
they've designed a process here that they believe
will work. This is the one that worked yesterday, and
they believe it will work now. 

Q Were there any food fights?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't think they served any beverages
or refreshments.
 
Q When you say they believe, do you mean the
principals believe?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, as they say in their statement,
they believe that the process that they used
yesterday to reconcile some of these issues worked.
And they believe that if they try to employ it for
the larger issues, they might get somewhere.
 
Q Mike, what's next up on the table? I mean, I assume
you're moving from the easiest or least controversial
issues to the tougher --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Substantively, I can't -- I can't answer
that question substantively.
 
Q Just one final process question. Did the form of
the discussions that have occurred so far suggest
that there's a kind of a component-by-component,
issue-by-issue approach to this budget in which,
while everybody may have a complete budget on the
table, those complete budgets become less relevant as
this process goes forward?
 
MR. MCCURRY: That's a very good question, Brit. I
can't -- since I did not participate in all of the
meetings and especially the Oval Office one, I can't
answer that completely. I can tell you that the
central elements of this budget discussion are now so
well-known to the participants in these discussions
that they can look at individual elements from some
of the different proposals out there -- whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's coalition, whether it's
Senate Democrat, whether it's the President's plan,
whether it's the original congressional resolution --
and know, based on what they -- take the element,
look at it, know, based on whatever the number is how
it would fit into an overall final agreement. 

So it's an interesting question and it probably is a
useful observation. There may be, if there's a final
agreement to be made, it's going to draw on a lot of
the different ideas that are out there.
 
Q Can I follow up on that Mike?
 
Q Is the President still going to pre-tape the radio
address?
 
Q There was a sense at the beginning of the week that
if this was bumped up to the principals --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Radio? We're going to do it live now. Do
we know the subject yet? Budget. 
 
Q If I could ask you a question to follow on Brit --
There was a sense at the beginning of the week that
if this was bumped up to the principals -- the
President, congressional leaders -- they took over,
they might be able to resolve it faster. Is it the
feeling now that the process you're talking about
would -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I don't know that I accept that
characterization. I don't believe that I've ever said
that. I don't know that anyone here at the White
House has ever said that. I believe it's been said
elsewhere that if the principals would get involved,
they might be able to resolve these issues quicker.
But that was always --
 
Q Well, they said --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think that's correct. But I don't know
that that's ever been entirely clear.
 
Q Is it your feeling that the process that involves
the Chief of Staff and the chairs of the committees,
the process that they're developing works better?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the point I'm making is that it
worked yesterday. We had an agreement -- remember, we
had an agreement to conduct some face-to-face talks
without preconditions, and that process failed
because it was not acceptable to a portion of the
House Republican caucus. Now we've got a process.
That process seemed to work yesterday in narrowing
some differences. And it's encouraging that they now
are going to employ this process as they work through
next week and then to prepare for the meeting -- 

Q What's the process?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It's the one that's defined in the
statement. And we've been through that four or five
times already. 

Q One thing you haven't said in the good meeting is
whether or not the principals themselves made any of
the decisions they were talking about having to make
going into the meeting. Everybody talked about making
tough decisions. Did they make any decisions today or
just agree on --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the toughest decisions are those
that are dealing with the most controversial items in
the budget. And as you know, they didn't attempt to
resolve those today. 

Okay, anything else?
 
Q Yes, there's one more important point on
contractors. Contractors are not getting paid. What
happens -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I can't help you at that level of
detail. 

THE PRESS: Thank you.

-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE: Catfish
processing -- Highlights

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Catfish processing -- Highlights
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Estimates refer to November 1994 and 1995. Catfish
Processing Down 5 Percent Farm-raised catfish
processed during November totaled 34.1 million pounds
round weight, down 5 percent from November 1994. The
average price paid to producers was 78 cents per
pound for November 1995, unchanged from the last two
months and 1 cent above a year ago. Net pounds of
processed fish sold during November totaled 16.7
million pounds, an increase of 2 percent from the
comparable month in 1994.

Sales of fresh fish, at 6.91 million pounds, were up
6 percent from November 1994 and represented 41
percent of total sales. Frozen fish sales, at 9.77
million pounds, were down 2 percent from a year ago
and accounted for the remaining 59 percent of total
fish sales. Sales of whole fish represented 24
percent of the total, fillets accounted for 54
percent, and the remaining 22 percent were mostly,
steaks, nuggets, and value added products. The
November 1995 average price received by processors
for total fresh fish was $2.20 per pound, down 5
cents from last year. Prices for fresh whole fish
decreased 7 cents per pound to $1.63.

Prices for fresh fillets decreased 1 cent to $2.90
per pound. Total frozen fish averaged $2.48 per
pound, unchanged from November 1994. Prices for
frozen whole fish decreased 7 cents per pound to
$1.95, while frozen fillets at $2.82 per pound were
down 6 cents from $2.88 a year ago. Freshwater
catfish imports during September 1995 totaled 402
thousand pounds, up 25 percent from the 322 thousand
pounds imported the previous year. Ninety- six
percent of imports were from Brazil, with the
remaining 4 percent coming from Canada and Vietnam.
No exports were reported for September 1995. October
data were not available at the time of this release
due to Government furlough. If available they will be
included in the release on January 23, 1996. Import
and export data are compiled by the U.S. Bureau of
Census.

Catfish Processing Estimates Survey Procedures: 
Survey data for catfish processing are collected from
approximately 30 processors. All participating
processors must meet the minimum criteria of having a
capacity to process at least 2,000 pounds live weight
of catfish per 8-hour shift. The survey is conducted
entirely by NASS Headquarter's staff in Washington,
D.C. NASS field offices, however, are responsible for
keeping Headquarters informed of any new processing
operations in their state to ensure that the survey
coverage is as complete as possible. Processors are
contacted either by mail or telephone. Diligent
effort is made to ensure that all operations are
accounted for in the estimate. Estimation Procedures: 

The "Catfish Processing" report refers strictly to
farm-raised fish and excludes wild, captured fish.
Prior to summarization, questionnaires are compared
with the previous month's reports for comparable
placement of data, reasonable price levels, and
reasonable inventory carryover given the sales and
processing totals reported. Estimates are made for
those processors whose reports are not available in
time to be included in the release. These plants are
identified by an asterisk on page 5 of this release.
Estimates are normally based on the processor's
previous report and current conditions. Published
totals are a straight summation of the individual
reports and estimated data. Price items are weighted
by the associated volumes to compute weighted average
prices.

The published price for total whole fish, however,
reflects an adjustment to the round and gutted only
price to bring it to an equivalent dressed weight
price. If a plant uses a fiscal accounting system,
proration is used to convert reported data to a
calendar month basis. Only national level estimates
are published due to the limited number of plants
involved. Generally, individual items are not
published if there are less than three plants
reporting, or if any one plant has 60 percent or more
of the total.

One unique feature of the "Catfish Processing" report
is the listing of cooperating processors by name on
each month's release. This feature originally was
used to solicit industry cooperation in maintaining
coverage, but it has continued because of the
processors' overall acceptance of this policy. Import
and export data for frozen catfish fillets, which are
compiled by the Department of Commerce, are also
included in this report. Reliability: Catfish
processing estimates are based on a census of all
known active processors and, therefore, have no
sampling variability. However, estimates may be
subject to errors such as omissions, duplication, and
mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing of
the data. These errors are minimized through strict
quality controls in the edit and summarization
process, and a careful review of all reported data
for consistency and reasonableness.

Revision Policy:
Revisions may be necessary following a review of late
reports received from plants. Revisions of less than
2 percent of the existing published levels of any
category will normally not be made.

Definitions Used For Catfish Processing:
Average Price Paid to Producers - Refers to the price
of fish delivered to the processing plant door. Price
includes charges for any services provided by the
processing plant, such as seining and hauling, but
does not include any adjustments based on year-end
settlements.

Fillets - Boned sides of the fish, cut lengthwise
away from the backbone.
Fresh Fish - Fish intended for immediate consumption.
Also referred to as ice-packed.

Frozen Fish - Fish which are individually quick
frozen and glazed (IQF) or individually bagged and
bulk frozen.

Nuggets - Small fillets cut from below the rib
section of the fish. Usually includes breading or
added ingredients.

Round & Gutted Only - Fish with no processing done or
viscera only removed.

Round Weight - A term for fish live weight.

Steaks - Cross-section cuts from larger dressed fish.

Strips - Finger size pieces of fish cut from fillets.
Usually includes breading or added ingredients.

Whole Dressed - Weight of whole fish with only head,
viscera, and skin removed. Generally, 60 percent of
the live weight remains as dressed fish. Processing
data were compiled in cooperation with the following
processors:
* America's Catch Guidry Catfish Processors, Inc.
Amite River Industries Harvest Select Aqua Farm
Catfish, Inc. Lake's Farm Raised Catfish, Inc.
Carolina Classics Catfish, Inc. Pride of the Pond
Confish, Inc. Prime Line Catfish Co. Corbin Fish Farm
Seabrook Seafood, Inc. Delta Pride Catfish, Inc.
Simmons Farm-Raised Dorey Fish Co. Southern Farm Fish
Processors Farm Fresh Catfish Co. Southern Pride Fish
Breeders of Idaho Southfresh Farms Franklin Catfish
Superior Fish Processors Freshwater Farms, Inc.

* Estimated The next "Catfish Processing" report will
be released at 3 p.m. ET on January 23, 1996. The

-COMPUSERVE: CompuServe membership hits 4 million
worldwide

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-COMPUSERVE: CompuServe
membership hits 4 million worldwide -- Heading into
the holidays, online service expects unprecedented
growth to continue
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- CompuServe Incorporated, the
industry s most extensive online information service
provider and the largest Internet access provider in
the world, today announced that its worldwide
membership to the CompuServe Information Service has
surpassed 4 million individuals. With more than
200,000 new members joining the service each month
and local dial-up access in more than 140 countries,
CompuServe officials are optimistic about prospects
in the new year.

New computer owners are realizing the value of the
online service and the Internet, said Bob Massey,
CompuServe s president and chief executive officer. A
computer that is not connected to cyberspace is like
a television without sound and color. People know
they need to be online, and CompuServe offers the
best value in the industry.

We are in an excellent position to continue our
unprecedented growth, Massey said. We have the most
extensive, most reliable global information network
in the world, and we are the world s largest Internet
access provider. We offer the deepest, broadest
content for new computer users and online veterans
alike. Plus, we keep making the service better. We re
adding outstanding content like TIME magazine,
exciting events like Mick Jagger online with voice
and video, and localized information for our members
around the world. 

Traditionally, the holiday season is one of the
biggest times of year for member acquisition in the
online industry. This year, more than 3 million
people are expected to get new computers. Our goal is
to reach 5 million members next spring, and we will
reach that goal, Massey said. For just $9.95 a month,
CompuServe members get 5 hours of access to more than
3,000 services, plus the Internet. Additional hours
are just $2.95 each. This announcement comes just one
day after CompuServe surpassed 500,000 members in
Europe, with 200,000 in the United Kingdom alone.
CompuServe is an H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) company.

Founded in 1955, H&R Block is a diversified services
company and the world's leader in tax preparation and
online information services. H&R Block Tax Services
handled almost one in every seven returns filed with
the Internal Revenue Service in 1995, serving 17.1
million taxpayers in more than 9,500 offices
worldwide. CompuServe operates the most comprehensive
online network in the world, providing services to
nearly 900 corporate accounts and more than 4.0
million users in more than 140 countries.

-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ETHICS: NIE claim theres no
excuse for not preventing police corruption

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
ETHICS: NIE claim theres no excuse for not preventing
police corruption -- Biggest problem is city hall,
not bad cops
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

Orlando - Neal Trautman, Executive Director of The
National Institute of Ethics, states today that there
is no excuse for not preventing police corruption.
The true root cause of most of the scandals seen
throughout the nation today does not even lie within
the police department. In fact, the vast majority of
law enforcement officers are victims, not villains. 

Contrary to what the media has portrayed, the New
Orleans Police Department is not filled with greedy,
corrupt, drug dealing cops. The 100 officers I met
are some of the most sincere, dedicated officers I
have ever had the honor to instruct. The officers
here are not villains. They are victims. 

Political Cause #1 - Pressuring departments to hire
new officers without conducting an effective
background investigation. Many agencies, having had a
scandal, have been forced to hire people without a
thorough background investigation. History has taught
us that this usually becomes a "root cause" for
future corruption.

In addition to forcing the department to hire
officers without an effective background
investigation, other political influences led to the
destruction of their law enforcement. Money is
usually a very poor way to motivate employees. It
ceases to motivate people the moment they receive it
and often results in decreasing levels of dedication.

Political Cause #2 - Not supporting officers with a
fair salary. When officers are not paid enough to
support their families, common sense dictates that a
small percentage of normally good officers will give
in to the stress of being poor and the temptation of
easy drug money being so prevalent.

Political Cause #3 - Officers are understaffed and
overworked. Months and years of such pressure often
means that their original motivation of sincerity
evolves into the feeling that they are being used and
manipulated. 

Political Cause #4 - Politicians take actions that
demoralize officers. Unfair salaries, being
understaffed, not having enough time to provide
effective training, seldom being told that you are
appreciated; all create an internal culture that is
negative, cynical, suspicious and resentful. This, in
turn, leads to employees committing unethical acts. 

Political Cause #5 - Public officials created an
"internal culture" that causes unethical acts. Role
modeling is the greatest way to influence anyone's
behavior. When elected officials role model dirty
politics and hidden agendas, the police department
will usually have the same degree of shamefull
politics and hidden agendas which lead to corruption. 

The Solution:
1. Provide effective leadership training to replace
dirty politics with fair, respectful leadership.

2. Implement state-of-the-art, video and audio tape,
ehtical dilemma simulation training.

3. Implement an administrative process that prevents
unethical acts as opposed to simply reacting after
corruption occurs. 

Training is the vehicle that leads to the prevention
of scandals. The elected officials who created
circumstances that led to these events may have done
so because they didn't appreciate the consequences of
their actions. If so, then their education should
prevent the continued betrayal of integrity.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

SUBJECT: Presidential Certification to Suspend
Sanctions Imposed on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section
1511(e)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160) (the
"Act"), I hereby determine that the waiver or
modification of the sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro that were imposed by or pursuant to the
directives described in section 1511(a)(1-5) and
(7-8) of the Act, in conformity with the provisions
of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1021
and 1022 of November 22, 1995, is necessary to
achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in
Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to the parties.
 
Therefore, I hereby direct the Secretary of the
Treasury to take appropriate action to suspend the
application of the sanctions imposed on Serbia and
Montenegro pursuant to Executive Order No. 12808 of
May 30, 1992, Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5,
1992, Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993,
and Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993,
effective upon the transmittal of this determination
to the Congress. The property and interests in
property previously blocked remain blocked until
provision is made to address claims or encumbrances,

Public Notice 1427 of July 11, 1991, at the
appropriate time in conformity with the provisions of

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to
publish this determination in the Federal Register.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Memorandum of Justification for Presidential
Certification Regarding the Modification of the
Application of U.S. Sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro

The Serbia and Montenegro sanctions program is a key
element of the President's policy aimed at bringing
about a settlement of the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. The United States has continued to strive
during the past three years to ensure strong
enforcement of the sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro. This has maintained the effectiveness of
the sanctions program, motivating the Serbian
leadership to come to the negotiating table. 

The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, signed in Paris on December 14,
1995, produced agreement among the warring parties to
establish a single state of Bosnia-Herzegovina within
its pre-1992 borders. Bosnia will be governed by a
central government with constitutionally enumerated
powers over internal and international affairs and
will contain two entities. Along with resolution of
many thorny territorial issues, the parties agreed to
regional stabilization measures as well as to protect
human rights and fundamental freedoms and to hold
elections within the next year.
 
The agreement required more than two weeks of
intensive negotiations in Dayton. During the talks,
all sides were forced to make concessions on a range
of deeply held issues. The likelihood of sanctions
suspension was one of the key factors contributing to
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's agreement at
the talks. As the representative of Bosnian Serb
interests at Dayton, Milosevic's role was crucial in
reaching agreement. Sanctions relief was clearly
anticipated as a consequence of accord, and has
already taken the form of the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 1021 and 1022, adopted by the
Council on November 22, 1995.
 
Before agreeing to sanctions suspension, we insisted
on a credible reimposition mechanism to ensure no
backsliding on the commitments made by the Serbs. If
the IFOR commander or High Representative determines
that the FRY or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting
their obligations under the Peace Agreement, economic
sanctions may again go into effect against the Serbs.

Accordingly, we plan to leave the Sanctions
Assistance Mission infrastructure and monitors in
place.

Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:311295 12:40 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Let me just tell you what's going on
right now. The President of the United States is
thanking individually the various members of the
budget staffs that have been supporting the
administration team during these discussions, folks
from Health and Human Services, Treasury, OMB, the
National Economic Council, Mr. Panetta's staff, those
that have done extraordinary work over the last week
and, as you'll be able to tell in a moment, have got
an extraordinary amount of work today and tomorrow.
 
The budget discussions today led to an agreement by
the principals to instruct staff to really summarize
the discussions they've been able to have over the
last several days, which resulted in exploring the
differences that exist in a range of areas from
income support programs to welfare, to tax issues, to
health care finance issues -- to really summarize
those discussions and draw together the places where
there appeared to be some agreement between the
Republican side, the administration and the
congressional Democrats; and then, also set forth in
more precise detail the areas that there clearly are
still differences. 
 
That will lead to a meeting that will happen here at
the White House Tuesday evening, either late
afternoon or early evening -- I suspect more early
evening -- between the budget principals. They will
reconvene, review the discussion document that is
prepared by staff over the next day and a half, and
they will begin, I think they all believe, the more
serious discussions of tradeoffs that exist on the
large issues that will be fundamental to a final
agreement. But they all clearly remain committed to
this process and the process is working. They are
making progress because they are defining the areas
of agreement and disagreement more clearly. And the
President's satisfied that they're making progress. 
 
The President also strongly encouraged the
congressional leaders to find a way to pass some
measure that would restore federal workers to their
rightful places of employment. He also wants them to
be paid, but he understands that those are -- there
are different points of view on that issue. He hopes
they can resolve some of these issues.
 
Q What's his point of view on that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He believes they should be working, they
should be paid, and the government should be fully
open, as he said over and over and over again.
 
Q Any suggestion, any hint that they were close to
working some deal today?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They worked on it a lot. There was
considerable side-bar discussion during this meeting
between House and Senate staffers, and Senate
staffers between the Republican and Democratic side,
and that will lead to whatever action occurs on the
Hill shortly.
 
Q Did Dole and Daschle say they would --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm not going to comment on the business
that they need to do themselves on the Hill.
 
Q Mike, Tony Blankley said that there was one area
that was not covered in the walk-through. What is
that area? He said it was one major area.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I suspect -- can you run and check on
this? I suspect the answer to that is Medicaid. But
Barry will run that down.
 
Q They didn't act on that at all?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They spent a lot of time discussing
Medicare. The almost entire discussion today was
devoted to Medicare and different options. And what
the President and congressional leaders asked for is
something that really defines more clearly what the
policy choices are in Medicare given the respective
positions of the various budget proposals that are
out there.
 
Q Mike, in the event that there is some kind of deal
in the Senate, will there be any briefing here on
what -- the technicalities of what that means for the
government?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, if there's a final agreement in
Congress that would restore federal workers to their
jobs, OMB staff will be available to talk about how
that will affect any restart activities that they
have. But we'll direct that to OMB because they'll be
in the best place to analyze that.
 
Q Mike, can you confirm that as of yesterday they had
an agreement in principle to at least a packet of
savings of $100 billion in social spending?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that would be -- that requires
some rough eyeballing that I don't think you can
really do under the circumstances. There are
different ways that you can look at the categories of
things they've done here. There are some areas where
there are clear agreements and they should be able to
rather quickly write the legislative language that
would lock in some of the things they've agreed to. 
 
There are other areas where it's a little fuzzier,
where there are some different options that exist and
you could get a range of savings depending on how you
calculate it. But my guess is -- I saw that comment
in one of the stories today; I think that was
probably a rough eyeball guess that someone made that
would try to put a numeric value on some of the work
they've done. Frankly, I'd caution people here
against using that kind of calculation because the
ranges are so large when you look at the big ticket
issues. There could be considerably more in savings,
depending on how you judge the progress they made on
some of these discussions. 

Q What are the differences on Medicaid without going
into detail? Are they financial or are they
philosophical? 

MR. MCCURRY: Both. 
 
MR. TOIV: Medicaid is the issue, but it was discussed
in the context of block grants, the whole block grant
issue, but not separately as a --
 
MR. MCCURRY: The fundamental dispute there is the
guarantee of health care coverage and the federal
entitlement and what happens if you block-grant it.
Now, that's a large issue and one of the issues
covered particularly as they dealt with domestic
discretionary spending, which they did both yesterday
afternoon and yesterday evening.
 
So I think that they've touched on that aspect of
Medicaid, but they haven't gone through all the --
they haven't gone through it in the same detail and
precision on that issue as they have some of the
other areas that they've looked at. Now, that will be
covered by some of the staff work. They are going to
take some look at issues related to that as they work
over the next day and a half. They'll be preparing
some side-by-side analyses of how the different
issues play out.
 
Q Are they working from the same base numbers? 

MR. MCCURRY: They're working from the same
calculation of what the budget impact is based on CBO
numbers, yes.
 
Q What's the point of all these hours of walking
through this? It seems to me we all know what the big
differences are.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not necessarily true. I
mean, everyone knows what the big differences are and
what the big numbers look like on a single sheet of
paper. But remember, every one of those large numbers
is premised on fundamental policy decisions that have
a great deal of nuance and complexity associated with
them. And I think it's encouraging and the principals
are encouraged at how detailed these discussions have
been. They have looked item by item at these policy
implications of the large numbers. 
 
I think many Americans think, well, gee, you get
together in the room and you split the difference in
a simple arithmetic. That's not policymaking.
Policymaking requires attention to the detail that
underscores each of those numbers. And that's the
work they've been doing. 
 
Now, based on the very intense discussions they've
had, the staff can now summarize in a much more
detailed fashion what the specifics of a legislative
approach to a final budget agreement would look like.
That's encouraging because it means if they do reach
an agreement on a final budget package, the work of
assembling that and putting it in legislative
language would be considerably easier based on the
discussions they've had here. In a sense, one
participant compared this to something like a
conference committee on the Hill; they're doing much
the same thing they would do in a House-Senate
conference committee, looking at big issues,
discussing the policy differences, and then making it
possible for staff to write what amounts to a
conference report.
 
Q Are they getting a sense of how far away they are
from reaching some kind of final agreement? Are they
getting a sense of the kind of time frame they're
looking at?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They could be so near or so far away
because it will depend in part on what types of
tradeoffs they make on the large issues. They have
not attempted to take the big issues, as Hillary just
said that everyone knows are out there, and reconcile
them. They've approached this from saying, let's
narrow as closely as we can the differences that
exist and define better what types of tradeoffs will
exist once you've reached those big decisions. But I
suspect that by Tuesday night when they meet again,
they're going to start moving to those more
fundamental issues that will have to be embraced if
there's going to be a final agreement, which is why
right now it's impossible to say one way or another
whether they will actually reach an agreement.
 
Q -- an agreement in the order in which they'll take
up the big issues? Because, as you've said in the
past, you would prefer that the spending and the
final decisions on spending determine the size of a
tax cut.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't believe -- they have given a
list of specifics to the staff to address, but I
can't say for certain that the principals will work
through those issues in the same order -- that they
go from income maintenance through health care
finance issues to discretionary spending issues to
revenue issues. But I don't guarantee that that's the
order in which they will be addressed on Tuesday
night.
 
Q Would you say that they have finished stage one,
the walk-through process, then and are getting -- are
heading into stage two, the decision-making process?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They finished the walk-through process
during the course of the day yesterday, with the
exception of the more detailed discussion of Medicare
that they wished to have today. They are now
preparing for what amounts to the tradeoffs that will
have to occur.
 
Q Is the President ready to compromise and trade off? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, the President is ready to continue
to discuss these issues in good faith.
 
Q In what context have they discussed Social
Security?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It has been related to many of their
discussions of health care finance, Medicare in
particular, and related in some respects to their
AFDC discussions since they're all covered by the
various titles of the Social Security Act.
 
Q Did they talk about it in terms of --
 
MR. MCCURRY: They've had -- I believe they had a very
brief discussion of the CPI issue, and there was not
instant resolution of that.
 
Q You said that there's a day-and-a-half discussion
beginning on Tuesday evening that concerns --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, it was a day and a half for
work now. The staff is going to be working -- one of
the reasons the President wanted to spend some time
with our courageous and noble staffers is they are
now going to work for the rest of the day today and
they're apparently going to start about 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow and they'll be able to work all day long
tomorrow. That's not going to be any -- we're not
going to arrange any press coverage of that, that's
just the work they're going to be doing, both
informal and probably getting together at various
points.
 
Q Going back to -- how would you characterize the
agreement so far money-wise? You won't say $100
billion. How would you characterize it -- issue-wise,
money-wise?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've made good progress. It's a
large sum of money, but it's not satisfactory --
wouldn't be sufficient to reach the balanced budget
goals. That would require some additional
decision-making that obviously wouldn't happen before
Tuesday night.
 
Q Can you offer any color or anecdotal details of
today's meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they continued -- we do the best
on food more than anything else. (Laughter.) They had
the traditional congressional meeting donuts back
today, for some reason. We were on a health food kick
yesterday, but today -- normally, when the bipartisan
congressional leadership meet with the President they
have wonderful donuts available. And they reappeared
and quickly disappeared during the meeting today.
 
There was a lot of kibitzing. As the result of being
together over the couple of days, there were moments
where the partisan sides are able to tease each other
or get little quips in on each other from time to
time, and there was a fair amount of that going on. I
don't have a specific example of that that I can
think of off my head, but there's some of what I
would describe as general ribbing back and forth.
 
The Speaker was concerned that we all make sure that
--he was concerned about a question he got in the
pool session this morning and he was nervous that we
not over-interpret those -- the appearance on the
Evans and Novak Show. Some of us watched that and
some of us managed to stay awake through it.
(Laughter.)
 
Q As he shouted Ron down -- did they discuss that? As
he shouted Ron down, did he and the President then
discuss that? 

MR. MCCURRY: No, they didn't. They didn't, although
the Speaker reached that with some of us and we
didn't take any offense at his remarks.
 
Q You didn't take any offense at the remarks at all? 

MR. MCCURRY: No. Compared to other things that he
says, they -- (laughter.)
 
Q Dole and Gingrich have said before that they see
Wednesday as sort of a deadline; they're going to be
adjourning Congress and reopening Congress. Is there
any sense that you'll know by Wednesday that you're
going to have a deal or you're not going to have a
deal?
 
MR. MCCURRY: You mean on this question of federal
workers and --
 
Q No, no, no. No, over the budget deal, the budget
negotiations.
 
Q The CR would expire -- I mean, they're saying that
you're supposed to have it finished in the first
session, which is --
 
MR. MCCURRY: In the statutory and in the first
session is on Wednesday, and clearly one reason
they're meeting Tuesday night is with that deadline
in mind. But I wouldn't predict at this point it
would be possible to get an outline of agreement by
Wednesday. Certainly everyone hopes to get an
agreement on a balanced budget as quickly as
possible.
 
Q I watched the back-and-forth there. The money that
we're not supposed to put a numerical figure on
that's not necessarily $100 billion, but is something
-- what does that concern? 

MR. MCCURRY: I made that so absolutely, magnificently
impenetrable, there would be no way you could answer
that. (Laughter.) Look, the reason is as you look
through these issues it could be -- they've got --
$100 billion is a rough estimate of some of the work
that were in the so-called tier two issues that were
being handled at the budget advisors level. That's
where it has come from.
 
Now, if you look at some of the other issue areas --
the so-called tier three issues -- where they've
identified some agreement in policy approaches,
they've got considerably more than that, I would
guess. But I can't put a dollar figure on that, nor
should I, because it's subject to further discussion.
And in any event, as we've said all along again, they
have to get agreement on a whole package before it
all matters.
 
Q Tier two is what? Tier two is nonentitlement,
discretionary --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tier one -- they've defined issues as
they worked at both the staff and budget advisor
issues as tier one, tier two, tier three issues, as
they rank order some of the policy questions. And
just, for example, in the area of revenues I think
there were, what, Barry -- 70 separate issues that
they needed to examine.
 
Now, they range from -- tier one would be something
which there is a common approach both in the balanced
budget act, in the President's approach on policy
terms that's reflected in some of the other
discussion documents they've looked at, whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's Daschle, whether it's the
coalition budget, that there's some commonality
approach and they think they can lock in language
that would satisfy everybody. So, in other words, a
done deal; it looks like that will be easy to do. 

Tier two are areas where there are differences, but
they're fairly close. They can be significant policy
issues, but there are ways in which you could bridge
the gaps. And they concentrated a lot of work on the
tier two issues. And I think that's where they found
agreement that would take you beyond this mythical
$100 billion that was reported somewhere today.
 
And then tier three issues are the more fundamental
differences that really are central to getting final
agreement. And as I say, those are ones in which they
agree to sharpen up the discussion by really looking
for how you define and analyze the tradeoffs that
would have to happen in order to reconcile those two
or three issues. But that's work that will have to go
on on Tuesday. 

Q Does it have to be balanced down to a penny? I
mean, it has to be actually -- the numbers have to be
coinciding totally?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- it's more -- the more
important issue and then more of these discussions
have been around the policy has to be agreed to, how
do you -- what's the policy going to be.
 
Q Are tax cuts on the table?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tax relief for working families has
always been on the table.
 
Q I didn't ask that. I asked would tax cuts -- 

Q When this is all finished, for each of the major
topics they talked about will there be a figure for
each of seven fiscal years that will be the limit
leading to a zero deficit? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, when it's all said and done and
they have a final agreement they will have a document
that then can be scored by CBO that could produce
that type of analysis, sure. 

Q Going back to -- can you characterize at all this
-- without the figure, what kind of subject areas
there are agreement? How will you characterize the
areas they have agreement on? You don't want to do it
money-wise. Subject-wise, anything besides --
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, that's a -- I mean, substantively
we're not -- that just is more fuel for a lot of
incorrect speculation. And as the Speaker made the
point today, that it has helped them that they've not
tried to score points in the public discussion of
these deliberations.
 
Q I just want to clarify -- if, for purpose of
discussion the President is talking about CBO
assumptions in all of these discussions, is he then
acquiescing to CBO's growth predictions, its interest
rate predictions?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Not necessarily. I mean, that might be
that the issue of how you define assumption, will
look at assumptions -- and more importantly, how you
decided when certain budget features would trigger on
or trigger off.
 
Q I'm sorry, could you run that past me one more
time? You're saying he is not in agreement with the
CBO -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I said that -- the question is about
assumptions, has he agreed to lock in the CBO
assumptions. I think that's still an area that the
principals could explore as they look at issues like
when certain budget features trigger on, trigger off,
how you measure that and how you look at impact. For
purposes of these discussions they have agreed to a
CBO evaluation on what the budget options are. I'm
not going to get any more specific than what I just
said, although I just gave you a very good hint.
 
Q In talking about Medicare today and trying to talk
about their differences of viewpoint on medical
inflation, what are they -- whose numbers are they
utilizing?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, for an informed discussion they
use -- they were relying on budget experts at CBO, at
HHS, they were looking at different types of
analysis.
 
Q Oh, this is the last tier thing where if you save
money on discretionary in the last years then you
have to trigger off, based on if you beat the CBO
assumptions?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, trigger-on, trigger-off is an
aspect of various budget proposals that are out
there. There are some in the coalitions, there is one
in the President's most recent offer. 

Q What's he going to do at Hilton Head?
 
MR. MCCURRY: In Hilton Head he's looking forward to
seeing his friends, first and foremost; spending time
with his family; having dinner with his friends
tonight and spending some time outdoors tomorrow.
It's been raining --
 
Q What time do you expect --
 
Q Mike, will he say anything on going out to the
helicopter?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I think he wants to just get down
there and see his friends and have New Year's Eve
with people he's spent New Year's Eve with for the
last 12 years.
 
All right, happy New Year, everybody. Have a safe and
prosperous 1996.
 
Q Did they all wish each other a happy New Year? 

MR. MCCURRY: They did. Actually, they said goodbye to
each other, happy New Year to each other. There was a
little bit of discussion about travel plans for
everybody. I think, as you know, Senator Dole after
the senate session is going up to New Hampshire. 

Q Did the President wish him well?
 
MR. MCCURRY: There was some good natured discussion.
He's going for the first eve festivities, or
something like that. I would say that there continues
to be a good atmosphere in these discussions, but
everybody is realistic enough to know that there are
sharp differences that still exist and that there's a
lot of hard work ahead.
 
Q Any idea when they're going to actually be done
with any sort of an agreement on the seven-year plan
-- to they have a time -- can't do it by Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I think -- I think that everyone
understands -- the President is very cognizant of the
Speaker's concern about doing this within the
statutory calendar of the first session. In fact, the
President, at several points when it was suggested
there's going to be a lot of work that would have to
be done to get this discussion document together,
that it might not be done by Tuesday, the President
admonished everybody again and said it was very hard
to ask people to work on the holiday. But that
because of the Speaker's concern about January 3rd
and that date, that it was important to have a
meeting during the day on Tuesday, even if it had to
be late in the day. So we understand the importance
of that and that's why everyone is committed to
trying to work this through as quickly as they can.
 
Q Do you think there will be meetings between the
principals Wednesday, Thursday -- every day until
there's -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I can't predict. I'm taking it a day at
a day. I'll tell you what I know, they plan to meet
Tuesday night and we'll see where we go from there.
 
Q So they have until midnight Wednesday night,
Thursday morning -- or is that --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not -- I want to make it
clear that's not a -- that's a date that's important
to the Speaker, for reasons that the Speaker can tell
you because it relates to the statutory deadline of
the first session, and it also relates to the
continuing resolution issue. But I think we need --
you know, from our point of view we just need to
continue to work to try to resolve the issues and do
it as expeditiously as possible.
 
Q Is it midnight Tuesday or midnight Wednesday -- 

MR. MCCURRY: You should ask the House Speaker. It's
their deadline, not ours. 
 
Thank you.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: The returning without approval of
H.R.1530

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- The returning without
approval of H.R.1530
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R.
1530, the "National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1996." 

H.R. 1530 would unacceptably restrict my ability to
carry out this country's national security objectives
and substantially interfere with the implementation
of key national defense programs. It would also
restrict the President's authority in the conduct of
foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief, raising
serious constitutional concerns.
 
First, the bill requires deployment by 2003 of a
costly missile defense system able to defend all 50
States from a long-range missile threat that our
Intelligence Community does not foresee in the coming
decade. By forcing such an unwarranted deployment
decision now, the bill would waste tens of billions
of dollars and force us to commit prematurely to a
specific technological option. It would also likely
require a multiple-site architecture that cannot be
accommodated within the terms of the existing ABM
Treaty. By setting U.S. policy on a collision course
with the ABM Treaty, the bill would jeopardize
continued Russian implementation of the START I
Treaty as well as Russian ratification of START II --
two treaties that will significantly lower the threat
to U.S. national security, reducing the number of
U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by
two-thirds from Cold War levels. The missile defense
provisions would also jeopardize our current efforts
to agree on an ABM/TMD (Theater Missile Defense)
demarcation with the Russian Federation.
 
Second, the bill imposes restrictions on the
President's ability to conduct contingency operations
essential to national security. Its restrictions on
funding of contingency operations and the requirement
to submit a supplemental appropriations request
within a time certain in order to continue a
contingency operation are unwarranted restrictions on
a President's national security and foreign policy
prerogatives. Moreover, by requiring a Presidential
certification to assign U.S. 

Armed Forces under United Nations operational or
tactical control, the bill infringes on the
President's constitutional authority as Commander in
Chief.
 
Third, H.R. 1530 contains other objectionable
provisions that would adversely affect the ability of
the Defense Department to carry out national defense
programs or impede the Department's ability to manage
its day-to-day operations. For example, the bill
includes counterproductive certification requirements
for the use of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) funds and restricts use of funds for
individual CTR programs. 
 
Other objectionable provisions eliminate funding for
the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrict the retirement
of U.S. strategic delivery systems; slow the pace of
the Defense Department's environmental cleanup
efforts; and restrict Defense's ability to execute
disaster relief, demining, and military-to-military
contact programs. The bill also directs the
procurement of specific submarines at specific
shipyards although that is not necessary for our
military mission to maintain the Nation's industrial
base.

H.R. 1530 also contains two provisions that would
unfairly affect certain service members. One requires
medically unwarranted discharge procedures for
HIV-positive service members. In addition, I remain
very concerned about provisions that would restrict
service women and female dependents of military
personnel from obtaining privately funded abortions
in military facilities overseas, except in cases of
rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. In
many countries, these U.S. facilities provide the
only accessible, safe source for these medical
services. Accordingly, I urge the Congress to repeal
a similar provision that became law in the
"Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996."
 
In returning H.R. 1530 to the Congress, I recognize
that it contains a number of important authorities
for the Department of Defense, including authority
for Defense's military construction program and the
improvement of housing facilities for our military
personnel and their families. It also contains
provisions that would contribute to the effective and
efficient management of the Department, including
important changes in Federal acquisition law.
 
Finally, H.R. 1530 includes the authorization for an
annual military pay raise of 2.4 percent, which I
strongly support. The Congress should enact this
authorization as soon as possible, in separate
legislation that I will be sending up immediately. In
the meantime, I will today sign an Executive order
raising military pay for the full 2.0 percent
currently authorized by the Congress and will sign an
additional order raising pay by a further 0.4 percent
as soon as the Congress authorizes that increase.
 
I urge the Congress to address the Administration's
objections and pass an acceptable National Defense
Authorization Act promptly. The Department of Defense
must have the full range of authorities that it needs
to perform its critical worldwide missions.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295 5:20 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Several people said they needed more
than the paper that you now have available, so have
at me.
 
Q I need something on the budget.
 
MR. MCCURRY: You need something on the budget? Well,
we need a budget, period, so we can put the
government back to work --

Q Gingrich said a little while ago that he thought
that maybe you should negotiate every day until they
got an agreement. Is the President willing to do
that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I thought the idea was that they were
going to lock everyone in a room and --
 
Q That was the freshmen --
 
Q What's your reaction to all that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Whether we would be willing?
 
Q -- marathon talks?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We would be willing to lock the
President and the Speaker, the Majority Leader and
the Democratic leaders in a room until they get a
deal so long as we could lock the House Republican
freshmen out.
 
Q I may need Q-tips, Mike, but I can't hear what
you're saying.
 
Q Can you talk up, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Their approach has not been
constructive, because they had been insisting on no
compromises. For a negotiation of that nature to work
there has to be a give-and-take attitude and a
good-faith negotiation. We keep getting -- we've got
a particularly interesting idea here from Senator
Dole and from Speaker Gingrich that we just go ahead
and accept unacceptable appropriations bills and we
can talk about it later. That's putting the cart
before the horse and allowing them the opportunity if
they so choose to get up and walk away and leave us
stuck with bills that are not in the interest of the
American people. So there's a lot of -- the President
is concerned that we're getting back into a cycle of
shenanigans here rather than serious, good-faith
negotiations that will move us forward. 
 
The President has been working hard today, as you
know. He's withheld comment on some of these more
boisterous remarks. And he just wants to work
tomorrow, see if we can make progress on budget
issues, achieve the goal of a balanced budget, and
above all else, get our government open so the
American people get their government back. The
President was disappointed today to hear that the
Republican leadership assessment is that they will
force the American people to go at least six more
days with a lack of full government services as we
negotiate these budget issues. The President has
consistently demonstrated that he is conducting these
discussions in good faith. And he believes that
that's reason enough for the Republicans in the House
of Representatives to lift this shutdown of
government services.
 
Q Mike, have you heard back from your officials who
are at the budget talks today?

MR. MCCURRY: I don't -- I believe they're still
working. At last report, they were still working. And
the only thing we've heard is that they continued to
work in a productive environment. And they continue
to focus on how they can help the decision-makers
narrow differences tomorrow.
 
Q What time is the budget advisers meeting set for
tomorrow, and where will it be held?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We believe it's going to be around 10:00
a.m., 10:30 a.m. and on the Hill, we think.
 
The Congress is hosting tomorrow, so it will up to
them to announce. But we're planning for 10:00 a.m.
to 10:30 a.m. on the budget advisers meeting. Then we
intend to host the Democratic leaders here at roughly
2:30 p.m. tomorrow; and the full principals group,
including Representative Armey, the Speaker, the
Majority Leader, who will then be joined by the
Democratic leaders at approximately 3:15 p.m., 3:30
p.m., in that neighborhood.
 
Q And do you have an agenda for those talks? Is it
going to be on narrow items or broad-ranging policy?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What the team of staff people from the
Congress and the White House have been doing are
really shaping those discussions by looking at what
the different proposals are. Remember, this is about
more than dollar figures. It's also about the
policies that underscore those numbers. When you pick
a number and put it in a budget outline, it's not a
number picked out of thin air. There are policy
assumptions that underpin those numbers. And what the
-- what we believe the staff people have been doing
is looking at where those policy differences are and
sharpening up that discussion so the budget advisers
and the principals can have a more enlightened
conversation.
 
Q Are you saying he's going to meet Dole and Gingrich
at 2:30 p.m. and then broaden the meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I'm sorry, he's going to meet with
Senator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt at
approximately 2:30 p.m., and then they'll be joined
by the rest of the group later. 

Q And, excuse me, is there a session with the
President and Panetta here before Panetta goes to the
Hill? 

MR. MCCURRY: They will be talking at some point.
We're not certain when that will happen, but we
expect Mr. Panetta back in town sometime later
tonight.
 
Q Mike, both Gingrich and Dole seem to be talking
about tomorrow's principals talks carrying over until
Saturday and maybe even beyond that. Is that an
expectation the White House has? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, we -- we hope they're right,
because that would reflect and be some sense of
optimism, and that would indicate that they are hard
at work and moving towards the goal of a balanced
budget, which is what the President desires.
 
Q Is it incorrect to say that the President's team,
having reviewed kind of what ought to go on the
table, has some new markers to lay down or has some
new ideas?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I believe that we are prepared to have
good-faith discussions. And, you know, we're willing
to bridge differences that exist as long as there's a
willingness on the other side to reciprocate.
 
Q Has the President done anything himself today to
personally move the process along -- like has he
talked to any of the Republican leaders on the phone?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's continued to work on this
extensively. And he would prefer that we keep any
conversations that he may have had private.
 
Q So what's he done?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What?
 
Q So what's he done if he's been working so hard? 

MR. MCCURRY: He's been working with Director Rivlin.
He's been having some conversations. He's been
working hard. 

Q Are you denying he -- I mean, how do you say it --I
mean, you prefer not to -- I mean, you're saying he's
had some, but you just won't say who?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I said I would prefer to keep any
conversations that he may have had private, at his
request. 

Q Well, we're not asking you for the -- what the
conversation is; who did he talk to?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he didn't --
 
Q Did he talk to Dole and Gingrich?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He would prefer that I not say.
 
Q Did he protest the fact that they don't meet again
-- the House doesn't meet again until Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's very concerned --
 
Q -- to them?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- very concerned by the statements from
the Republican leaders today that made it clear that
they don't really have any intention of moving
forward to open the government before next Wednesday.
The President believes the government ought to be
reopened now. And he believes the fact that they are
involved in good-faith negotiations to balance the
budget should be reason enough for Congress to pass
the necessary continuing resolution that would reopen
the government.
 
Q Gingrich says it won't pass the House -- just the
intention.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the Speaker -- probably a very
candid assessment of the Speaker's read of the
sentiment of some his members. But he also pointed
out that 79 members apparently can hold hostage the
majority of the House, which is unfortunate.
 
Q What was the read here on the freshmen press
conference today where they said -- they sort of took
the stance of we just want to stay and get this done;
everything's on the table and so forth? Is that a
shift in your opinion?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It was a shift from the position they
took after we met with the Speaker and the Majority
Leader and worked through a way that we could both
reopen the government and have good-faith
negotiations and developed a formula to have the
President -- remember, the President agreed with the
Speaker and the Majority Leader to have exactly those
around-the-clock discussions. And that agreement fell
apart when those same House Republican freshmen
objected. So it sounds like it's a change of tune on
their part -- 

Q But what's going on?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- and if it's a more constructive
attitude on their part, we welcome it.
 
Q Mike, is the President willing or unwilling to
compromise on funding levels for Medicare, Medicaid
and the size of a tax cut?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President has always indicated that
he's willing to have good-faith negotiations. And he
understands that he can't rule out compromises. On
the other hand, he has repeatedly and consistently
made clear his fundamental priorities in this
discussion. They are now a matter of law because
they're in the continuing resolution. They have been
adopted by the Congress presumably. And they include
providing and continuing necessary funding for
Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Q What is the White House expectation tomorrow
afternoon that with Gingrich and Dole saying, you
know, if we can meet for two or three days we get
this hammered out, that tomorrow afternoon will be
the beginning of long negotiations over the weekend?
I mean, what's the White House expectation?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We share their abundant hope that they
can reach that --
 
Q Dole also said he was going to New Hampshire
Sunday, so --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, I noticed that the Speaker of the
House seemed to criticize him for that, but we
certainly wouldn't. 

Q Mike, Senator Dole also talked about bringing the
welfare --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Harold, how am I doing? (Laughter.) 

Q Terrible. (Laughter.)
 
MR. MCCURRY: All right, let's wrap this up -- our
intent is to give you a full lid when we're done
here, right? Have we checked on a full lid?
 
Q Mike, Dole also said that he was thinking about
bringing the welfare bill here tomorrow in the hope
that the President might sign --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Look, welfare reform is now a subject
we've had enormous volumes of discussion about with
this Congress. They know very clearly what the
President considers welfare reform. And they know
very manifestly that this ain't it.
 
Q Mike, why did the President not go ahead and sign
the executive order on the military pay raise today?
Is there's some technical issues he's waiting --
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he did.
 
MS. TERZANO: -- it may have been signed already. It
wasn't signed immediately because we were changing
the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: We were conforming the text and doing
some other things necessary to make sure they had an
accurate submission. But as our statement earlier
indicated, he intends to put that forward. We should
have the -- we do have the text out now. 

Q Dole started talking about sending the
appropriations back and changing them a little bit.
Is that a -- I mean, he said it before, but he's
never said about changing them. 

MR. MCCURRY: I took that idea on a little bit
earlier, Kevin. I just said that that's not -- that's
not a constructive approach here. They're asking the
President to put the cart before the horse, to accept
unacceptable appropriations bills as a condition for
having discussions -- it seems. And that's not the
environment of good faith discussions that we've had
up to this point. 

Q But if they were willing to take out some of the
provisions in some of these bills that the White
House has objected to --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that -- they need to do a lot to
fix these appropriation bills, and they know that.
And most of what they need to fix are very essential
to the budget discussions that are being held; that's
why the President vetoed these appropriations bills
in the first place.
 
Look, they are feeling -- and rightfully so --
feeling a great deal of heat now for keeping this
government shut for 14 days. And they're trying to
indicate that they're doing something about that and
they're suggesting that, you know, if Clinton had
just signed these appropriations bills -- and I think
the American people know the President cast these
vetoes because he can't accept what he thinks are not
in the best interests of the American people. 

Q Didn't he take the defense appropriation and veto
the authorization?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He vetoed an authorization bill for the
specific reasons that he cited.
 
Q Right, but he took the appropriation bill, even
though it was $7 billion more than he wanted.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he took a defense appropriations
bill and accepted it and signed it for the reasons
that he set forth. A defense authorization bill
establishes long term national security policy; and,
in this case, very clearly would commit the President
to an unrealistic and unnecessary Star Wars program.
And also, simultaneously, various elements that
infringe on his constitutional responsibilities --
unlike an appropriations bill that provides mirror
funding for programs that have already in many cases
been authorized in law.
 
Q My understanding of the budget negotiation process
was that they were going to deal with technical,
easier to resolve issues first, and then sort of
center in on the big core issues. Is that still the
case? Or are they now going to try to deal with --
because, I guess Dole said the opposite, we need to
get these core issues resolved now, then the rest of
the stuff will fall into place fairly easily.
 
What's the expectation of the order?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't want to dispute the Majority
Leader's interpretation. I mean, there are
fundamental core issues that everybody understands
and they are -- there are differences that exist
there and that's where the bulk of the hard work will
have to occur -- as when they get to the principals
level. 
 
In a sense, they are working through these issues
that we hope the staff has made progress on that
today. We hope the budget advisors can make further
progress to codify some of that work tomorrow. And
then that will have to be considered by the
principals because one agreement that they do have,
based on their prior conversations, is that none of
this package can be agreed to until all the elements
are agreed to.
 
But I think what the Majority Leader was suggesting
-- look, we've got to resolve these other issues and
the other parts of the puzzle fit into the final
agreement.
 
Q What is this business on good faith? Every time
either side opens his mouth they start -- if the
other would only operate or negotiate in good faith.
Is there no good faith at this table?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, we believe there is. We don't like
some of the things that happened today publicly, but
the President chose to withhold his fire and didn't
answer back some of these more boisterous remarks.
 
Q He sent you out --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I've been very temperate.
 
Q Has the President expressed to the White House
staff his strong and irrevocable preference --
everything else being equal -- to go to Hilton Head
for at least New Year's Eve, if he can so do without
being irresponsible in deserting -- ending
negotiations?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. He said -- you know, he said on
balance he'd like to go and have a party with his
friends on New Year's Eve. But he'll only do that if
it seems like the right thing to do and it makes
sense at the time.
 
Q Does he have --
 
MR. MCCURRY: But he doesn't sound like it's
irrevocable and he has a lust for Hilton Head that is
insatiable and incurable. (Laughter.) I wouldn't be
surprised if he goes, I wouldn't be surprised if he
doesn't go.
 
Q Saturday is he clearing the decks to stay here and
work on budget?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He plans to be here on Saturday, at this
point. He would like -- I mean, his original -- as I
told some of you, his original desire was to try to
go down to South Carolina Saturday night. But he's
willing to delay that or cancel that if it's
conducive to getting a budget agreement.
 
Q But does he expect to spend much of Saturday
working with --
 
MR. MCCURRY: You know, we have no way of knowing. I
don't -- ask me tomorrow, this time tomorrow night
and we might have a better idea.
 
Q Mike, one last one. When you said that the
President chose to withhold his fire, that makes it
sound like he was at least angry at what Dole and
Gingrich were saying?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he just -- you know, look, they sent
welfare reform down with great fanfare today, but the
world knows where President Clinton is on reforming
welfare. He wants to do it, but he wants to do it the
right way. He doesn't want to do it in a way that
takes it out on kids and makes it harder to get
people back onto work. And everyone knows that the
President's view of welfare reform, as he clearly
stated it to the Congress, does not make it possible
for him to embrace this type of measure. 
 
So they passed this with great fanfare, as if it was
actually going to mean something. And, you know, they
know it doesn't.
 
Q Will he continue to exercise this kind of
discipline about holding his fire by keeping the pool
outside the doors to cover --
 
MR. MCCURRY: When he feels it's the appropriate thing
to do, yes. If you prefer not to have the picture we
can, you know, cancel that kind of opportunity.
 
Q Well, it was humiliating.
 
MR. MCCURRY: We try to make sure everyone doesn't
have to stay cold.
 
Q If there was this goodwill that you talked about on
both sides, is it really a two or three day process
to work this stuff up?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, no. I mean, he -- let's not
misinterpret what the Majority Leader said. He said
we could -- he said we could get an outline by two or
three days. No, there -- because of all the work, we
hope that some of the work the staff is doing will
make it possible to get a final agreement in a form
that can be passed by Congress quicker. But that's a
lot of hard work that goes into just doing that.

And even if the principals agree to the framework of
a budget, there will be -- take some time to draft a
final measure.

Q How long -- what's a more realistic assessment of
how long it would take?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I've heard Dr. Rivlin say it would take,
you know, maybe a week. I don't think anyone has ever
pinned it down. But our hope is that some of the work
that this -- that, you know, what the staff has been
doing in the last day is looking at exactly those
types of questions: What are the policy differences
that exist in that type of measure.
 
Q I'm sorry, when you say a week, do you mean from
the time they have an outline we can expect some sort
of -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Yes, that's a rough -- I mean, that's
not -- that was just a rough estimate at one point,
and she -- you know, it would depend on the
complexity of any agreement they reached or -- you
know, getting a --
 
Q But a week to do what? I didn't quite follow you. 

MR. MCCURRY: To actually draft the bill that would
have to be passed. They just have to be put in
legislative form and -- an outline is not the same
thing as specs they can write a bill off of. But
that's apparently what we think the other folks have
been making some progress on.
 
Q But it's your understanding that once there's a
plan in hand that they'll be willing to go ahead and
do a CR, correct?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We -- based on the Speaker's comments
today, it seemed to me that -- he said that if it was
clear to members of the House that there was an
agreement, that he would be able to proceed on
unanimous consent to get a CR.
 
You know, our view is that they know that when it's
working towards this end then they ought to decouple
the question in keeping the government open. But
that's been our view all along and it's been ignored
by the House of Representatives.
 
Q Do you think their feeling the heat more than you
are?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think everyone is feeling the heat
because this is an outrageous situation. It's been
two weeks worth of government services lost to
Americans who need them. I calculated today, there
are 32,000 American families that have got their -- 

Q Oh, here he goes.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'll do the whole list for you.
 
Q No, no, no. You can post it. (Laughter.) 

MR. MCCURRY: But just one example: 32,000 American
families who went -- you know, the end of this year,
looking forward to next year -- in many cases
probably giving up leases on apartments because
they're moving into their first homes, don't have
anywhere to go because they can't get their FHA
mortgages closed. That's not a good situation. I
think people in this room have probably been up
against, you know, a mortgage closing before -- and
these people are losing those opportunities.
 
And that's -- you know, that's one more small slice
of life in this shutdown, not to mention all the
federal workers and their families who aren't getting
paid -- all the contractors now who are losing
services, and they'll never regain -- there's no
legislation pending in Congress that restores
contracts or restores economic livelihood to people
who provide services to the government. 

So it's a bad situation and it's -- you know, one
thing that the Speaker said today which is manifestly
true, it was all unnecessary.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: President vetoes defense
authorization bill; Raises pay for military

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- President vetoes defense
authorization bill; Raises pay for military
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

The President today vetoed the fiscal 1996 defense
authorization bill, but took steps to ensure that the
military's uniformed men and women receive the full
2.4 percent pay raise that he had requested.

The bill would have constrained the President's
ability to carry out national security policy; forced
the deployment of a costly and unnecessary ballistic
missile defense system that would threaten the ABM
treaty; and interfered with his management of key
national defense programs. Moreover, certain
provisions would have raised serious constitutional
issues by restricting the President's authority to
conduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander in
Chief.

"I am anxious to have Congress delete the
unacceptable provisions in this bill and to return it
to me for my signature," the President said.

The bill would have provided for a 2.4 percent pay
raise for uniformed men and women. In light of his
veto, the President wanted to ensure that uniformed
men and women were not harmed as he worked to resolve
differences with Congress on the bill. 

Consequently, he is issuing an Executive Order today
that provides for a 2 percent pay raise, the most
that the law allows him to do. He also is sending
legislation to Congress today to implement a full 2.4
percent pay raise, giving the military full
comparability with civilian pay raises since civil
servants benefit from locality pay increases as well.
(The legislation also would increase two pay-related
allowances for uniformed personnel -- one for
housing, the other for food).

"I welcome separate action on the pay raise; I want
it to be effective on January 1 and I will sign it as
soon as I get it," the President stated. "We are
committed to giving the troops a full pay raise and
we ought to do so immediately."

Unacceptable provisions in the authorization bill are
numerous. Among the most important are the
requirement to deploy a costly, unnecessary ballistic
missile defense system in the U.S. by the year 2003,
which would put U.S. policy on a collision course
with the ABM Treaty. Also, the bill would restrict
the President's ability to conduct contingency
operations and require certifications to Congress of
command over such operations that infringe on his
authority as Commander in Chief.

The bill also would unwisely restrict the Nunn-Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction programs, direct
procurement to specific contractor facilities, force
unwarranted discharge of HIV-positive service
members, and restrict the ability of female service
members and dependents of military personnel to
obtain privately-funded abortions in military
facilities overseas. 

The President did note that the bill contains
important authorities for military construction,
family housing, acquisition reform, and management of
information technology which he hoped to see return
in an acceptable bill.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Statement by the President

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Statement by the President
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Today I have signed into law House Joint Resolution
136, which ensures that the Government makes
veterans' benefit payments to 3.3 million veterans
and their survivors without further delay. 
 
The resolution also provides funding for several
vitally important programs for children and families.
It continues funding for Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), ensuring that nearly 9
million children receive benefits vital to their
well-being. It funds child care for about 600,000
children whose parents are trying to work their way
off welfare. And it continues funding for State child
support enforcement agencies to ensure that "deadbeat
dads" do not get a reprieve from supporting their
children.
 
In addition, H.J. Res. 136 provides authority for the
District of Columbia to continue full operations. The
resolution contains an objectionable provision that
would single out poor women by prohibiting the use of
District funds for providing abortion services. I
have opposed including this provision in the regular
fiscal year 1996 District of Columbia appropriations
bill. Nevertheless, H.J. Res. 136 allows the District
government to continue to operate without disruption. 

Although I welcome H.J. Res. 136, it is a poor
substitute for what the Congress should do
immediately -- that is, send me an acceptable
continuing resolution to reopen the departments and
agencies that are at least partially shut down
because they lack fiscal year 1996 appropriations.
Along with the Departments of Veterans Affairs and
Health and Human Services, they include the
Departments of Education, Labor, Housing and Urban
Development, Commerce, Justice, State, and the
Interior; the Environmental Protection Agency; the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the Small Business Administration. 

To be sure, H.J. Res. 136 prevents the serious impact
that the partial shutdown could have had on 3.3
million veterans and their survivors as well as
nearly 9 million low-income children. But the
shutdown continues to hurt millions of innocent
Americans -- from the 20,000 parents and students
each day who cannot apply for student aid, to the
2,500 moderate-and low-income working families each
day who cannot get their Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) mortgage loans processed.
 
The shutdown also has forced the affected departments
and agencies to furlough a total of about 280,000
Federal employees, throwing their lives into
disruption and raising their fears just as the
holidays approach. Federal workers, who are already
being asked to do their jobs more efficiently as we
downsize the Government, deserve better.
 
The congressional majority apparently wants to use a
partial Government shutdown to force me into
accepting their extreme budget plan. It did not work
last month, when the majority prompted an earlier
shutdown by not sending me an acceptable continuing
resolution. And it will not work now. 

The Congress should send me an acceptable continuing
resolution to reopen the Government, return to work
the 280,000 Federal employees who were furloughed
through no fault of their own, provide back pay for
these workers, and give the American people the
services they expect from their Government.

-HUMMINGBIRD COMMUNICATIONS LTD: Hummingbird acquires
Intranet solution provider Common Ground Software 

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-HUMMINGBIRD
COMMUNICATIONS LTD: Hummingbird acquires Intranet
solution provider Common Ground Software Inc. --
Acquisition provides Hummingbird with advanced
portable document technologies for building
organizational Intranets and information systems
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

North York, Ontario, Canada -- Hummingbird
Communications Ltd. (TSE: "HUM" and NASDAQ: "HUMCF"),
a worldwide technology and market leader in PC to
UNIX integration software, announces that it has
acquired Common Ground Software Inc., a leading
developer of advanced electronic document
technologies for organizational Intranets (Intranet-
an internetwork of Web servers and clients within the
company firewall). 

The acquisition significantly broadens Hummingbird's
product line by adding Common Ground's premier suite
of document authoring, management, and collaborative
documentation development technologies. The addition
of Common Ground technology further enhances
Hummingbird's ability to service the future needs of
its customer base, many of whom are building
Intranets. 

Hummingbird had previously licensed Common Ground's
technology for inclusion in Columbus, Hummingbird's
Intranet/Internet desktop suite. The combination of
Columbus, an advanced Intranet desktop suite for PCs,
with Common Ground technology and Hummingbird's
existing PC internetworking software products enables
Hummingbird to offer customers a highly functional
suite of tools and applications for building
enterprise-wide information systems and
organizational Intranets. 

"Common Ground technology is the missing link in our
Intranet strategy, and will form an integral
component of our advanced Intranet desktop suite,
Columbus. Common Ground's electronic document
technology offers more than just document authoring
and archiving tools(it provides organizations with a
highly functional platform for information management
and workplace collaboration," stated Fred Sorkin,
Chairman, President, and CEO of Hummingbird.

"The whole context for electronic document technology
has been changed by the explosive growth in
networking. As a leader in internetworking
technology, Hummingbird is ideally suited to the job
of marrying Common Ground's existing technology with
Intranets," said Nick Gault, VP of Engineering and
founder of Common Ground Software.

The total purchase price, payable in cash, is
approximately US $6.0 million. Under terms of the
agreement, Common Ground's key development and other
personnel will continue to be employed by
Hummingbird.

Common Ground's product suite includes a
platform-independent electronic portable document
technology, DigitalPaper, a collaborative document
authoring environment; Intranet/World Wide Web
publishing and archival tools; and utilities that
enable legacy documentation to be easily converted to
a portable electronic document format for
enterprise-wide and/or Intranet/Internet
distribution. 

Collaborative document authoring tools were found to
be highly desirable in a recent report by Zona
Research Inc., of Redwood City California that
surveyed organizations developing Intranets.
According to International Data Corporation, of
Framingham, Massachusetts, the compound annual growth
rate for advanced Internet/Intranet suites is 39.7%,
and is expected to reach US $134.1 million by 1996. 

Hummingbird Communications Ltd. specializes in the
development of PC-to-enterprise internetworking
software products and Intranet software solutions

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Livestock, dairy,
and poultry monthly

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Livestock, dairy, and poultry monthly
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Dairy Prices To Be Mixed
Average farm milk prices in 1996 are expected to rise
slightly from this year. Skim solids prices are
projected to decline as production outstrips
commercial use, largely offsetting higher milkfat
values. Prices will average above a year earlier in
first-quarter 1996 as prices adjust downward from a
higher seasonal peak this fall. But are projected to
be near a year earlier during the second and third
quarters and are not expected to reach this year's
peak in the fall.
 
The support price for manufacturing grade milk will
rise 25 cents per cwt to $10.35 effective January 1,
1996. The increase was required under current
legislation because projected 1996 net removals,
adjusted for the increase in 1994 imports from the
1986-90 average, fell just under the trigger of 3.5
billion pounds, milk equivalent, total solids basis.
This is the first triggered increase since triggers
became a common feature of dairy legislation in the
early eighties.
 
Strong export demand for butter was the main reason
the projected surplus fell below the trigger level.
However, the support purchase price for butter cannot
legally be increased. Therefore, the support purchase
price for nonfat dry milk must increase 3.1 cents to
$1.065 per pound. The support purchase price for
cheddar cheese will rise 2.5 cents to $1.145 per
pound for 40-pound blocks and $1.115 for barrels. 

The increase in the support price is not expected to
affect average milk prices much, as higher nonfat dry
milk prices are not expected to affect cheese prices
significantly. Milk prices have averaged more than
$1.50 per cwt above the support price each year since
1992.
 
The early December crash in butter prices probably
was much sharper than needed to move surplus butter
into export markets. Aided by domestic stock
building, butter prices already recovered slightly
and are expected to run 20-35 cents per pound below
November's peak. Even though milkfat currently
accounts for less than one-third of the manufacturing
value of milk, potential swings in butter prices
could affect cheese prices.
 
Cheese prices are expected to decline gradually
through early spring but probably will have to remain
high enough to attract milk away from butter-powder
operations. This will make cheese prices particularly
sensitive to butter prices and milk output in cheese
areas. 

Nonfat dry milk prices rose considerably in November,
triggered by seasonally low production and possibly
low user stocks. However, expected expansion in milk
production in 1996 and smaller allowable Dairy Export
Incentive Program (DEIP) exports will keep powder
prices weak during most of the year.
 
Since 1990, retail dairy prices have risen about 1
percent annually, less than half the increase in all
food or all consumer items. This year, prices of
manufactured dairy products rose more than fluid milk
prices, largely because of continued relatively
sizable increases in prices of frozen desserts and
miscellaneous products. Retail dairy prices are
expected to rise 1-3 percent in 1996, following an
increase of less than 1 percent in 1995. Prices of
products containing more milkfat will tend to rise
faster than skim-based products.
 
Moderate Beef Expansion Continues
Preliminary cow slaughter estimates for 1995 strongly
suggest that moderate herd expansion will continue in
1996, resulting in higher beef production at least
through 1997. In spite of the sharp downturn in
lightweight feeder cattle prices this year, cow
slaughter as a percent of the January 1, 1995,
inventory was only 13.6 percent, up only marginally
from 1994 and below the industry liquidation level of
15 percent or higher.
 
Both beef cow and heifer slaughter rose 8 percent
from 1994, indicating a slowdown in the rate of
expansion is underway. Steer slaughter, on the other
hand, was up less than 1 percent, which is somewhat
surprising given the large number of Mexican feeder
steers imported from late 1994 through this past
summer.
 
Calf slaughter increased nearly 12 percent in 1995,
reflecting this year's larger calf crop and the
dramatic decline in lightweight feeder cattle prices.
Heifer calves may have accounted for a sizable
portion of the increased calf slaughter.
 
Beef exports are expected to remain strong in 1996,
insulating the domestic market from larger beef
supplies. However, continued high grain prices,
particularly if exacerbated by drought, would force
larger beef supplies on the market and increase
downward price pressure. 

Higher grain prices and poor winter wheat grazing
prospects are putting additional pressure on lighter
weight stocker-feeder cattle prices. But favorable
forage conditions in most areas and record hay
production are allowing these cattle to remain on
pasture or forage for additional weight gain.
 
Fed cattle prices in December were down about $2 per
cwt from a year earlier, with 750- to 800-pound
feeder cattle prices down $9 and 500- to 550-pound
stocker calves down more than $22. With larger feeder
cattle supplies carried over into 1996, and a larger
expected calf crop, good planting conditions next
spring and favorable crop development next summer
will be critical if lighter stocker cattle prices are
to avoid further declines. 
 
Choice beef supplies remain tight, with retail prices
up 6 cents per pound from a year earlier in November,
reflecting the strong hotel-restaurant and export
demand. All fresh beef prices were up less than 2
cents, with prices for most non-Choice cuts used in
calculating the composite price down from a year
earlier.
 
Pork Prospects Viewed Favorably 
Rising grain and protein meal prices over the past
month will add about $3 per cwt to the cost of
producing hogs. Cash breakeven costs when these
animals are marketed in the spring will approach
$43-$45 per cwt, compared with about $40 in December.
Each 10-cent-per-bushel increase in corn prices adds
about 40 cents per cwt to the cost of producing hogs.
 
Higher grain prices have not curbed recent optimism
in hog futures contracts. In early December, the
April, June, July, and August 1996 hog futures
contract were trading near $50 or above, offering
producers an opportunity to more than cover recent
grain price increases. Corn prices would have to
approach $5 per bushel for producers to view the
current market climate as overly bearish.
 
The premium currently carried on spring futures
assumes pork production is slated to trend lower over
the next 6 months. Using historical price- supply
relationships, estimated production next spring would
have to be held to about 4.175 billion pounds. That
is 275 million pounds or about 1.5 million head below
current production/slaughter projections. This would
have to be accomplished by either reducing
September-November 1995 sow farrowings or the average
number of pigs saved per litter. 

Both cases may be argued. Pig survival rates this
fall may have been lower due to heat stress last
summer. Higher grain prices may have squeezed
operating margins and caused farrowings to fall below
reported intentions for September-November. The
December 1 Hogs and Pigs report will be released on
December 28 and should provide additional insight
into 1996 production.
 
Egg Prices Exceptionally Strong
Lower egg production in the fourth quarter has led to
sharply higher wholesale and retail prices. Wholesale
prices are continuing strong in December. The 2- to
3-percent decline in egg production this quarter
should have caused prices to rise 10-15 percent
rather than 20-25 percent. Seasonal strength during
the holidays has probably contributed to a stronger
than usual increase in prices as retailers strive to
assure supplies will be available.
 
The number of eggs in incubators on November 1 for
egg-producing birds was 13 percent higher than a year
ago. These birds will be ready to enter the laying
flock in April and May, suggesting flocks will
continue expanding next summer. A return to 1995
flock size is expected by spring, with about 1-2
percent more eggs expected to be produced in 1996.
 
Egg exports are projected to increase slightly in
1996, as egg product exports increase more than the
decline in shell egg exports. Decreases in Export
Enhancement Program funds for shell egg exports are
mandated to decline under GATT.
 
Turkey Prices Weakening
Larger cold storage stocks of turkey parts in
November and slower movement of whole birds during
Thanksgiving have contributed to seasonally declining
turkey prices. Prices remain above a year ago, but
the difference has narrowed.
 
December production is projected to decline 2-3
percent from a year earlier based on one less
slaughter day. However, weekly production during the
month will be higher due to heavier slaughter
weights. 

Cumulative placements of turkey poults for
first-quarter 1996 slaughter are fractionally above
last year. Larger increases in poult placements in
early 1996 will be necessary to reach the forecast
4-percent production increase.
 
Broiler Production Forecasts Lowered
Production estimates for early 1996 have been lowered
100 million pounds because of the impact of last
summer's heat stress on the broiler hatchery supply
flock. Production of pullets for placement in the
flock appears to have been affected. Also,
hatchability of eggs continued to lag behind normal
levels into the fall. These factors have limited
pullet placements and are expected to limit
production increases in early 1996. 

U.S. poultry exports to Hong Kong are expected to top
1 billion pounds in 1995, up over 40 percent from a
year earlier. Hong Kong is the second largest market
for U.S. poultry products. Most of these exports were
transhipped to China. However, starting in late
November, the Chinese government cracked down on
poultry imports from Hong Kong, which had been
exported illegally or undervalued to limit tariff
payments. 

U.S. poultry exports to China are growing, but are
only forecast at 80 to 90 million pounds in 1995.
These products also include broiler parts such as
wing tips, feet, and necks, as well as bone-in dark
meat.

-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO: Concern
grows over  provocation of war in Chiapas'

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR
DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO: Concern grows over  provocation
of war in Chiapas'
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

The National Commission for Democracy in Mexico is
extremely alarmed by the Mexican government's growing
efforts to provoke a war in Chiapas. While the
Zapatista indigenous communities have worked to build
cultural centers to promote the dialogue with the
national and international civil society and to
strengthen the process for peace with dignity and
justice, the Mexican military has mobilized convoys
of armaments and soldiers and sought to provoke the
Zapatistas. 

The position of the Mexican government is that the
mobilizations are maneuvers related to the normal
rotation of deployed troops. However no one in the
area believes this. For example the Congressional
Committee set up by Zedillo and Bishop Samuel Ruiz'
committee, CONAI, have been carrying out marathon
negotiation sessions with the government regarding
its provocations in Chiapas.

The United States government is complicit in what is
happening as it has continued to provide
unquestioning economic and military support to the
Zedillo government in much the same way that it
supported former President Carlos Salinas,--Zedillo's
predecessor and mentor, and who has now been linked
with one of the largest international drug cartels.
This unquestioned support for the Zedillo government
is tantamount to cover-up of serious human rights
abuses, including the lack of any action by the State
Department regarding the attack on Cecilia Rodriguez,
a US citizen who on October 26th was raped by armed
men in Chiapas as a political act of intimidation. In
large part this cover up is to hide the failure of
NAFTA and the resulting profound social and economic
upheaval in Mexico. 

In response to this critical situation, the National
Commission has organized a U.S. delegation to
Chiapas.

Originally set up to participate in the Zapatista New
Year festivities, the delegation will now also serve
as human rights observers to document the Mexican
military's provocations and violations of human
rights laws. The Commission is also preparing a
Freedom of Information Request to bring to light the
extent and nature of US involvement in the
low-intensity war in Chiapas.

Cecilia Rodriguez' New Year Message
CHALLENGE FOR 1996
THE CONSTRUCTION OF CENTERS OF RESISTANCE

"These buildings being raised represent the work of
many people. They will be a place for cultural
events, where different communities can share as
brothers, share their customs. A center where all can
walk freely, as true brothers, sharing their
happiness and their presence. A place which allows
them to have exchanges of their social life,
expressed through a song or a dance.

That is why they are important. They sustain a sense
of community, brotherhood, unity, resistance. They
are also a space where the whole world, no matter
their place of origin can be received as a brother,
regardless of whether or not they are indigenous.
Honest people who wish to participate in the path of
our people.

We have never had a center like this. We did not have
them because each community felt separated, each
followed its own path to find the solution to its
problems. But now, with this new consciousness, the
need to become organized is necessary. We must build
something together. It is the truth that before among
our people, we saw each other as enemies, or as
strangers, without relationship to one another. Now
that barrier has been broken.

There has always been a common condition, but the
circumstances of an unjust social system during so
many years made our communities feel isolated,
destroyed its social base, its values. Now we have
recovered our unity. That is why they come from many
parts, tzotziles, tzeltales, choles and tojolabales,
to collaborate in the construction of a space which
we say is for peace... we do not hide the truth..we
are speaking of peace."

Comandante David
Clandestine Indigenous Revolutionary Committee EZLN
on the construction of the Centers of Resistance,
Chiapas, Mexico, 12-27-95
by Cecilia Rodriguez

It is now the practice of the Zapatista communities
to come together in gigantic democratic assemblies.
To organize themselves into massive human chains of 4
to 500 people to travel to a distant place in order
to construct hope. Together they agree to leave
behind their "personal" lives, because they know that
hope lies in the organization of each other, and the
concentric organization of others. They are
accustomed to walking patiently for ten or twelve
hours to come to a humid, rough-hewn auditorium and
then to sit and listen to one another, without
interruption, without self-destructive emotional
outbursts that sabotage a collective discussion,
without posturing and exaggeration. It is their
practice to wait, and wait and wait until together
they can give birth to a good decision, and then it
is their practice to work together, to surrender
their "individuality" so that it is possible to carry
out that decision.

That is their proposal for a "new democracy", a
living process which has worked well for them for
hundreds of years. They are able to carry it out
because their culture builds and reclaims a set of
common values and a shared belief system. This is not
an argument for cultural superiority, it is an
acknowledgement of the strongest reason for their
success and their continued survival.

It is the dusk of the old year, another small step in
humanity's crawl towards the 21st Century. Most
natural in all of us is to stand still for a moment
and reflect on the days that have slipped through our
fingers, on the decisions and plans and thoughts that
have guided our steps. From this examination should
come wisdom, skills for the good fight in the days
that come, inspiration and strength in order to
confront the difficulties of new undertakings.

For those of us who have worked together for a peace
with dignity in Mexico each day which has passed
since January of 1994 has been filled with
uncertainty, and joy in the midst of simultaneous
pain. The hands of the clock have always spun out of
control ticking off events and changes which slip
past us like objects in the swollen river of history.

We should congratulate one another for our tenacity
in denouncing an invisible war in spite of the
studied indifference of the mass media. We have as
well managed a modicum of faith, because while time
has worn away those driven by sheer emotion and
romanticism, many of us continue to work in the
simple belief that the work itself will teach us
better ways of doing things. Sometimes, by the seat
of our pants we have managed to gather the financial
and human resources necessary in order to fight back,
in order to say to the powers-that-be "We are here!
We reject your global project! We demand, together
with the Zapatistas, the power to decide our own
destiny!"

In spite of these accomplishments; we have failed
miserably at the most important and transcendental
lesson of the Zapatistas, their sense of community,
their willingness to work at one another's and our
side and build a new global project together, their
sovereignty and sense of self and independence in the
face of projects they consider deadly to their human
nature. Our ability to understand this, to undertake
certain tasks with clarity and patience will be the
elements which will determine whether we can move
forward in our struggle for peace with dignity in
Mexico in 1996.

Together, whether we like it or not, we confront this
global economic system where financial capital is
dominant. It is the portion of the economy most
dependent upon speculation, and corruption, it feeds
on mergers, and the concentration of power. It
provokes the elimination of national borders,
identities, spheres of production and governments
creating a global environment where vast financial,
industrial and political power can be concentrated in
the hands of a few. It is a profoundly undemocratic
economic system.

Its parasitic state has deteriorated to the point
where it can no longer afford, the "benevolent
capitalism" inherent in Keynesian economics. It
regresses, returning to the dramatic contradictions
and extreme vacillations dictated by the forces of a
market "liberated" by technocrats who argue that all
this suffering is "temporary", and that, upon the
integration of certain populations into the market
the benefits will befall all who can live that long.

Civil discontent and social change is anathema to
this economic hallucination, so it invests millions
in sustaining armed forces capable of controlling the
kind of discontent inherent in starvation, misery,
and extreme poverty. Financial capital has played a
dominant role for the past 50 years in the world, and
its phenomenal impact is manifest in the pillage of
entire continents in the pursuit of a quick profit
procured through short-term investments. We live in a
world where bankers prey on its resources like hordes
of locusts. We are mostly overwhelmed by its size and
its power.

Not so the Zapatistas. As hundreds of indigenous
communities organize to construct not just one, but
many new Aguascalientes, the government and the
military watch with extraordinary fear. They fear the
continuation of this intense dialogue which they have
maintained with the world since they emerged on
January 1st of 1994. They fear that this strange
disease called dignity, and the euphoric freedom
derived from risking everything in order to find
something new, will spread.

They watch in terror as hundreds of indigenous people
traipse to and from, machete in hand, lumber on their
shoulders, and smiles on their faces. They pace and
wonder as hundreds more prepare food for the
others--they have no inkling of how to explain such
extraordinary movements. Haunted by the spectre of
their own brutality they accuse them of military
preparations--how else does one elicit victory, how
else does one win this slow and silent war? What
could possibly result from a "dialogue", from such a
cultural exchange? They await, terrified that they
will be blown up by a corrido, their skulls crushed
in by hundreds of people dancing to La Valentina--
barracks disguised as cultural centers, unarmed
children brazenly confronting their tanks and
artillery... what a danger to their omnipotence!

They parade in their tanks bristling with their
weaponry, faces scrunched beneath their concave
helmets, yelling and waving their guns "we want war,
we want war now!" --and the Zapatistas continue to
mobilize, to build, to invite people to come and
exchange ideas and hopes and proposals for a new
nation, and indeed a new world. What the hell is to
be done with them anyway?

Follow their example. Take history by the horns and
say "No 70,000 people will die as they did in El
Salvador, no 250,000 as in Bosnia...we will seek the
path of reason until all avenues are exhausted, we
will force the path of reason because there are
millions of us and a few of them, we will disable a
war driven by rage and despair." Respond to their
call, strengthen that path of reason by not leaving
them alone. Help them build these cultural centers,
these Towers of Babel where we can bow and beam at
one another because although we do not share the same
language, we share the same dream, and that makes us
silly with happiness.

The cultural centers that the Zapatistas are now
building can provide us with the opportunities and
examples we need in order to go about a new path for
peace. Some can claim that pieces of this path were
pioneered during the war against Vietnam, and the war
in Central America, but just as we learned so did the
opposition.

We must rise to the challenge of imaginative
strategies. As the first people to rebel against this
global project, the Zapatistas have also pioneered
new strategies. That is why together, we must find a
way to implement them, and allow that experience to
nurture effective international strategies. That is
why these centers of resistance are an important
investment in peace and in the future.

UPON MY RETURN TO CHIAPAS
The success of the strategy of low-intensity warfare
hinges on the continued isolation of the EZLN and its
base communities. It is clear to me that the United
States State department is complicit in this
strategy, that behind the backs of the American
people, this country participates in the preparation
of a war.

In a recent story in the National Catholic Reporter
an anonymous source in the State Department
supposedly stated that they had offered to accompany
me to file a police report with the appropriate
Mexican authorities but that "I had refused". It must
be public knowledge that there has been no such
offer, there has been no communication of any nature
between myself and the State Department in regards to
the rape I was subjected to on October 26th of 1995.
It should also be public knowledge that Todd
Robberson of the Washington Post interviewed me under
the guise of publishing a full report on the
phenomenon of rape in Chiapas a few weeks after my
return. In spite of his continual assurance that a
report would soon appear none has ever materialized.
The latest information is that Robberson's post on
the Mexico City desk has apparently ended.

The advice of books and therapists tells me that a
full year is required to recover from this kind of
trauma. It has always been my theory that the State
Department would like for Mexico to appear serene and
under control until after the next administration is
put into office. Neither party can afford another
Bosnia-like disaster on their hands. I wish it were
possible to afford a full year of recovery. I wish I
could pretend that I am separate and better than
those thousands of indigenous women who labor under
the cruelest of conditions, who hope and dream as
fervently as I do for my own children, who suffer the
continual sexual harassment of military checkpoints,
and the humiliation of body searches.

I wish I could turn my head in indifference upon
learning that the Border Patrol now constructs
"holding pens" in preparation for what they assume to
be "hordes from Mexico" escaping the chaos which the
U.S. Treasury Department itself has created. I wish
pretend the Border Patrol does not chase our people
down the street as though they were animals. I wish I
were unable to feel the deep sense of shame that
comes when I listen to the level of corruption and
the cynicism which reigns in the party-state system
of Mexico.

If there is nothing else I can do with what is left
of me, I can say to this stupidity that rules both
our countries "You have not won. You may use
psychological terror, rape, torture, death, and media
manipulation but your time is limited. Your reign is
coming to an end, its end is inevitable, because it
is illogical, unproductive, contradictary to nature
and to humanity. We have also learned about
low-intensity warfare, and reached deep into our
souls to find the spirit of those who have lived on
this earth for thousands of years, to find that human
spirit that hungers for progress and for freedom,
that values human dignity above possessions.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANC: President Mandela's
message on Christmas Day
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:251295

I am delighted to speak to all South Africans on this
Christmas Day.

Just as this period of goodwill is the time to thank
the Lord for the blessings on our nation in this past
year, it is also a moment of deserved relaxation with
our loved ones, especially the children. It is a time
for sharing.

As we enjoy this great moment, we should also
remember the children who do not enjoy the care of
parents or loved ones. There are many citizens, too,
who cannot fend for themselves, confined in hospital
or disadvantaged in many other ways. Let us show them
compassion during this period and beyond.

Each one of us should draw pride from our efforts to
bring sunshine into the hearts of others.

Let this Christmas period be the time for us to renew
our commitment to work together as one nation to
build a better life for all South Africans.

I send a message of love and peace to all fellow
citizens and our friends across the globe. Let us
embrace one another and build on the spirit of
reconciliation that has become the hallmark of our
rainbow nation.

As we rejoice in the wonderful year we were blessed
with, let us pray to be peacemakers and builders of a
harmonious nation. 

Let peace reside in all our hearts!

-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE: Hogs and
pigs -- Highlights

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Hogs and pigs -- Highlights
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

U.S. Hog Inventory Up Slightly U.S. inventory of all
hogs and pigs on December 1, 1995, was 60.2 million
head. This was slightly above December 1994 but 1
percent below the September 1, 1995, inventory. This
is the highest December inventory since 1980.
Breeding inventory, at 7.13 million head, was up 1
percent from both December 1, 1994 and September 1,
1995. Market hog inventory, at 53.1 million head was
slightly above last year but 2 percent below last
quarter.

*****

Beginning March 1996 the line up of the quarterly
estimating states will include Arkansas and Oklahoma
but will exclude Tennessee. The report will contain
an estimate for the each of the quarterly states, the
17 state region, the 33 annual state region, and the
U.S. total. Mt An 4 (12-95) The September-November
1995 U.S. pig crop at 24.9 million head was 2 percent
more than 1994 and 4 percent more than 1993. Sows
farrowing during this period totaled 2.99 million
head, only 9,000 head below last year. Litter rate
increases continue at a record level, with an average
of 8.34 pigs saved per litter for the
September-November period.

Last year the litter rate averaged 8.18 pigs per
litter. Hot weather late last summer did not
significantly reduce farrowings or litter rates. This
is largely due to increased production by larger
operations with environmentally controlled facilities
which minimize the affects of adverse weather. In
addition, market hog prices, relative to corn prices,
provided little incentive for herd reduction. Pigs
saved per litter by size of operation ranged from
7.45 for operations with 1-99 hogs to 8.64 for
operations with more than 2,000 hogs and pigs.

U.S. hog producers intend to have 2.92 million sows
farrow during the December 1995-February 1996
quarter, 1 percent more than the actual farrowings
during the same period last year and 1994. Intended
farrowings for March-May 1996, at 3.31 million sows
are 2 percent above 1995 but 2 percent below the 1994
period. The December-May intentions utilize 87.4
percent of the breeding herd, compared to 87.0 for
actual farrowings last year and the 5 year average of
86.7 percent. The number of operations with hogs
totaled 182,700 during 1995, down 12 percent from
last year and 19 percent below 1993. Places with
2,000 or more hogs on hand accounted for 3 percent of
the operations and 43 percent of the inventory. A
year ago 2 percent of the operations had inventories
over 2,000 head and accounted for 37 percent of the
inventory.

Considering all hog operations, currently 6 percent
control 60 percent of the total inventory. Revisions
All inventory and pig crop estimates for 1994 and
1995 were reviewed using final pig crop, official
slaughter, import, and export data in U.S. level
balance sheets. Based on the findings of this review,
no revisions were made to the inventories for June
and September 1995 along with the 1995 March-May pig
crop. This report was approved on December 28, 1995,
by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture and the
National Agricultural Statistics Service's
Agricultural Statistics Board.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Remarks by the President in photo
opportunity with Congressional leaders

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
photo opportunity with Congressional leaders
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:301295 11:35 A.M. EST
 
THE PRESIDENT: I want to be brief today because we're
getting off to a little late start. We've got a lot
to do. I have three things to say. I think we made a
good start yesterday, we're making progress, and I
believe we need to open the government. I hope we can
agree to do all that.
 
Q Sir, do you know any more information on the
soldier who was wounded in Bosnia?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Our reports are sketchy and I have
tried to get an update, but what I do know is that
there were apparently two vehicles and four soldiers
involved. Only one was seriously hurt and he has been
medivacked to Croatia in a hospital there, and we
understand he's in stable condition.
 
But mines have always been our biggest concern and
we're working very hard on it, but that's what
happened. And we'll continue to monitor it and do the
best we can. The mission itself is going very well.
The people have received our soldiers very well and
I'm very well satisfied with the progress. And I'm
obviously very sorry this happened, but they're
making good progress on the mine problem, but it's
going to be difficult to get rid of them all. 

Q -- the measure to get the workers back that's going
to get through Congress?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Well, it passed the House. We hope we
can pass in the Senate today, so make some progress. 
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: We tried to pass a clean CR, one
without any conditions. And that was objected to, but
I hope we can work something out.
 
Q But isn't the fact now that the Democrats are
holding things up?
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: Not at all. As a matter of fact, as
I said, we passed a continuing resolution -- we had
no conditions. It sent people back to work, and that
was objected to. So we're not trying to hold anything
up here. We hope we can get some sort of an agreement
as early as today.
 
Q Well, what's it going to take to get a deal? 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just something. I
think the President had a right -- we're glad to have
you all in. We have a lot of work to do. We made, I
thought, real progress last night. It is not easy. We
have very significant areas we have to work on, but I
thought the spirit was very positive. We don't just
want to get the federal workers back, we want to get
them paid. And in order to do that, I think we've got
to get this whole thing worked out. But I thought we
had a great start last night. And with you all's
permission, I think we can get a lot more done in the
next few hours. 

Q Mr. President, is the message from the Democrats
basically that they don't trust you?
 
THE PRESIDENT: We've got to go to work. Thank you
very much. 
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Dole and Speaker Gingrich

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President
Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 3:40 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: I want to welcome the congressional
leaders back here after Christmas. We're going to
have, I think, a good meeting today, based on the
work that has already been done this morning. I
expect us to make further progress.
 
We will begin to deal with some of the difficult
issues today involving how we can balance the budget
and protect things like Medicare and Medicaid and
education and the environment, which I think are very
important. I believe we're proceeding in good faith
and I think we're making progress.
 
I do believe that we ought to move to reopen the
government. As you know, I feel very strongly about
that. The public services will begin to be
significantly curtailed. And, of course, I'm
concerned about the federal employees -- those that
aren't working who want to work, who are going to get
paid regardless, and those who are working who
haven't gotten paid who are going to run into some
very serious financial problems with their mortgages
and other things soon. So I hope we can get some
agreement to reopen the government so that these
problems can be averted.
 
Q Is there some room for compromise now that you've
had a little bit of time to think it over over the
holidays?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're -- I've gotten a
preliminary report. I think we'll have some more
progress this afternoon and then I expect we'll work
all day tomorrow. I'm prepared to spend whatever time
it takes to move as quickly as we can move. But some
of these issues are quite complicated in terms of
their impact on the American people. But I'm ready to
go and I think that all of us are.
 
Q Mr. Speaker, do you see any way of having an
agreement that can reopen the government without the
--
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll discuss it this afternoon.
And I think that Senator Dole and Congressman Armey
and I have been trying to work out a way to both get
the currently nonessential employees deemed
essential, which Senator Dole began to work on last
week after our meeting here, and also to find a way
to possibly get everyone paid. We feel strongly that
federal employees ought to be back -- all the federal
employees ought to be at work. We know they want to
be, and it's not fair to them. And we also feel
strongly we ought to try to find some way to get
everyone paid. We also have an obligation under the
continuing resolution that was adopted about six
weeks ago to get a balanced budget by next Wednesday
morning, at the latest, at the end of the first
session of Congress.
 
So I agree with the President. I think there are
reasons to be cautiously optimistic. I wouldn't
exaggerate them, but I think we've made some progress
over the last few days, and I would hope in the next
two or three days we could basically get this done
and then have everything up and running and everyone
paid for while the staff work was finished out on the
actual technical details. 

Q Let me clarify, though, sir -- is there any way to
get the people back to work without resolving a
balanced budget plan? 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: There might be a way -- yes.
 
SENATOR DOLE: Yes.
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: We're going to explore today some
ways to get that done by unanimous consent over the
next two days. But I think it takes working it out
together, and we haven't done that yet. 

SENATOR DOLE: Just let me add that we're sending --
we're in recess now in the Senate, subject to call of
the chair, and I hope to be able to give Senator
Daschle some language to look at this afternoon. And
I want to congratulate Congressman Armey for his
leadership on the House side with the Speaker,
because if we can work this out it could be done yet
today.
 
Q And have people back to work?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Well, it would go down to the President
as quickly as we could. It's a Middle East peace
facilitation act. It's the same language we passed
last Friday in the Senate deeming people essential.
And the third element of the package would be
expedited procedure, if we get an agreement, so we
can get it through the Senate in less than 60 days, I
guess. We just take the budget reconciliation
language and shorten the time and put that in the
resolution. 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll try to get that down here by
sometime this evening if we can get it all worked
out. It's all got to be done -- our system is
complicated even at best, and it takes a little
while, but we hope to get it worked out today.
 
Q President Clinton, what's your reaction to that,
sir? 

THE PRESIDENT: I think the people ought to go back to
work and I think they ought to be paid. And I think
if we don't do it we're going to see some very
serious consequences that should not -- that neither
the public, nor the public employee should have to
endure. And I think we need to keep working at this
until we get an agreement. I'm prepared to work until
we get an agreement. We've just got to keep working
through it.
 
But these are complex issues. To protect Medicare and
Medicaid, education and the environment, the things
that are at the core of the resolution we adopted,
and get the budget balanced in seven years is not
easy to do. We're going to have to work at it.
 
Q -- the Republicans rejected last time? You thought
you had an agreement on something like this and the
House Republicans rejected it?
 
Q Why did you change your position, Mr. Gingrich? 

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. Let's don't ask any
more questions like that. We're trying to work this
out and I think -- give us a chance to meet today and
give them a chance to do their work; let's see what
happens.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Radio address by the President to the Nation

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Radio address by the
President to the Nation
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:301295 10:06 A.M. EST
 
THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Tomorrow is New Year's
Eve, a time for celebration, friendship and hope.
Nineteen ninety-five has been a good year for our
country, and the coming year can be even better.
 
In Washington, we all know this has been a year of
serious differences and profound debate over our
nation's future direction. But if we remain true to
our values, we will prove once again that in America
we can have serious differences without leaving deep
divisions. We know our nation is strongest when we're
true to our fundamental values, giving every American
the opportunity to make the most of their lives,
remembering the duty we owe to our parents and our
children, preserving our families and our
communities, keeping America the strongest force of
peace and freedom in the world.
 
In our effort to advance these values, 1995 has been
a time of real progress and concrete achievement. The
key to our strength is economic opportunity for every
American. In 1995, the ingenuity and hard work of our
people has kept the economy growing, steady and
strong. In the past 12 months the economy created
1.75 million new private sector jobs. In every month
the unemployment rate has been below six percent. All
told, since 1993, we Americans have created nearly
eight million new jobs. The stock market has broken
every record. The deficit dropped for the third year
in a row, for the first time since Mr. Truman was
President. Long-term interest rates continue to fall,
bringing lower mortgage payments for working families
and more affordable credit for small businesses and
consumers.
 
A growing economy and lower interest rates are why a
million new Americans became homeowners for the very
first time in 1995. There were more new businesses
incorporated this year than in any previous year. And
here in Washington, in spite of all of our
differences, we made some real progress on an
important issue -- political reform. At long last,
Congress passed a law which applies to themselves the
same laws they oppose in the private sector. And at
long last, after three years of effort, the Congress
passed lobby reform legislation, banning gifts to
congressmen and requiring extensive disclosure about
the activities of lobbyists.
 
Most important, our communities all over America are
coming together around our values again. In city
after city, in state after state, violent crime is
down; the welfare and food stamp rolls are down; the
poverty rate is down; even the divorce rate is down.
And for two years in a row now, the teen pregnancy
rate has dropped.
 
It hasn't always been an easy year for America. There
have been moments that tested our national community.
In the wake of the terrible bombing in Oklahoma City,
which took the lives of 169 people, our nation
reached out and recognized the bonds that hold us
together. Out of the ashes of that tragedy a new
sense of national spirit took hold. We affirmed once
again that all Americans are in it together. We
recognized once again that we can't love our country
and hate our government.
 
And a strong America has been the world's strongest
force for freedom, peace and democracy in 1995. Our
brave men and women today are in the snows of Bosnia,
helping to uphold the peace agreement to end the
worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. And
from the cobblestone streets of Northern Ireland to
the sands of the Middle East, a strong America has
helped to bring peace to regions long torn by strife.
 
Yes, 1995 has been a good year for America. Our
people have accomplished a lot. And it goes without
saying, we still have one major task to finish to top
off the accomplishment of this year. We have to
finish the job of balancing the budget and to do it
in the right way.
 
As you know, for the last two weeks the Congress has
refused to pass legislation that would keep the
federal government open to serve the American people.
This has never happened before for this length of
time in the whole history of the republic. And it's
been very hard on three-quarter of a million public
servants who have to pay rent and utilities and
mortgage payments and buy food. And they're losing
pay at holiday time. And it's also cut off services
for millions of Americans who depend upon them.
 
This Tuesday, if the government is not open, clean-up
efforts will be stopped cold at 32 toxic waste sites
in neighborhoods around our country. Next week,
federal funds for unemployment insurance will begin
to run out, forcing states to scramble to find ways
to keep helping workers who have lost their jobs. And
the Meals On Wheels program to our senior citizens
won't go forward. Every day, nine of 10 work place
safety complaints go unanswered. And every day 2,500
people can't get guaranteed home mortgages. Every
day, thousands of young people looking for college
loans can't apply for them. If ever we needed a
reminder that our government is not our enemy, this
is it. 

Let me be clear: I am committed to balancing the
budget. Our administration already has cut the
deficit nearly in half, and I am determined to finish
the job. For weeks I've been working in good faith
with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to find
common ground, to balance the budget in a way that
reflects our values. Yesterday I met well into the
evening with Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader
Dole. And in just a few moments I will sit down with
them again, along with the Democratic congressional
leaders.
 
We are making real progress. We know that our work is
not done. We know we have much to do, so that the
American Dream will remain alive for every citizen,
and so that we can come together as a people, and so
that America can remain the strongest force for peace
the world has ever seen.
 
So on this New Year's, let's resolve that we will
balance the budget, but that we'll do it in a way
that will keep our country growing and that will be
true to our basic values. That is, we'll balance the
budget without gutting Medicare and Medicaid, without
deeply cutting education or the environment, without
raising taxes on working families. Let's resolve to
reopen the government and do it now. And let's
resolve to act without rancor or partisan bitterness
in the spirit of the new year and in the interests of
the American people. 

Nineteen ninety-five has been a year when we've been
true to the best of America. If we'll just work hard
and work together and follow our values, 1996 can be
even better. Hillary and I want to wish you and your
families a happy and health New Year. Thank you for
listening.

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
On September 21, 1994, I determined and reported to
the Congress that the Russian Federation is in full
compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria of
sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This
action allowed for the continuation of
most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Russia and
certain other activities without the requirement of
an annual waiver.
 
As required by law, I am submitting an updated report
to the Congress concerning the emigration laws and
policies of the Russian Federation. You will find
that the report indicates continued Russian
compliance with U.S. and international standards in
the area of emigration.

Christmas Eve message to the troops in Bosnia

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
Christmas Eve message to the troops in Bosnia
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:241295

THE PRESIDENT: Merry Christmas, and best wishes to
all of you on this Christmas Eve. I am honored to
speak today to the men and women of Operation Joint
Endeavor -- in Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary and Italy; on
ships at sea and skies overhead; and those preparing
to deploy. I know that all around the world Americans
who wear our nation's uniform are listening, and I
want to wish all of them well, just as I know they
wish you well as you embark on this historic mission.
 
With me today are the families of seven Americans
serving in and around Bosnia: Lieutenant Colonel Bob
Norman of the 621st Air Mobility Control Squadron in
Tuzla; Command Master Chief Jim Sirles on the USS
America in the Adriatic; Sergeant William LeBright of
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit on board the USS
Whidbey Island; Warrant Officer Willie Wade with the
586th Assault Bridge Company; Lieutenant Colonel
O'Malley Smith of the 353rd Civil Affairs Group;
Sergeant Mark Ackerman with the 114th Public Affairs
Detachment; and Linda Carsey, an Army Civilian
Contract Specialist on her way to Tuzla.
 
These families here remind us all of the Americans
we're sending to Bosnia. They're leaving their
families behind. And many of them are already far
from their loved ones this Christmas Eve. I want to
extend a special greeting to those families today. I
know that when we call on our troops to protect
America's interests and values, we also call on their
families. Their families' special sacrifice may not
make the headlines, but we could not be successful
without it, for as our troops stand up on America's
behalf, it is their families who stand behind them,
who keep them strong with confidence, support and
love.
 
These thoughts are especially close in our minds this
time of year. As Americans come together in this
season of peace, we know that you, the men and women
of Operation Joint Endeavor, are serving on a mission
of peace, the noblest mission of all. The pride your
families have in each of you is shared by all your
fellow Americans all across our nation. 
 
Ten days ago in Paris, the presidents of Bosnia,
Croatia and Serbia signed an agreement that turns
their troubled region from war to peace. Our nation
has an important interest in seeing that peace take
hold for the people of Bosnia, who have suffered so
much for so long; for the stability of Europe, which
is so crucial to our own stability; and for the
safer, stronger world we want to leave for our
children.
 
There is too much at stake in Bosnia today for our
nation to sit on the sidelines, and that's why we've
turned to you, our men and women in uniform. You
provide us with the power to meet threats to our
security. You have the strength to bring hope and
stability to people exhausted by war. We know, and
the people of Bosnia know, that you will get the job
done and that you will do it right.
 
Each side there wants NATO to help them safeguard the
peace they have agreed to make, and to help them live
up to their commitments to one another. They trust
you to create a secure environment so they can seize
this chance to rebuild their lives and their land.
They see in you how much can be achieved when people
find strength in their diversity. That is the power
of America's example.
 
I know this will be a demanding mission, but I know,
too, that you are up to the task. General Joulwan and
General Nash have assured me of that. And I have seen
it for myself. 

Earlier this month, I visited with the men and women
of Task Force Eagle in Germany. I saw in them the
qualities that all of you share, the qualities that
have earned our nation the respect and trust of the
entire world. Your training, equipment and
preparation are unequalled. Your reputation precedes
you. The most advanced technology protects you. But
just as important, you are strong in your character.
Time and again, without pause or complaint, you step
forward to serve our nation. 
 
In this new era of challenge and change, America's
obligation to lead for peace and human dignity has
remained as important as ever. In Bosnia, you, the
men and women of our Armed Forces, will bear that
charge with great honor. You will make the difference
between horror and hope, between a war that resumes
and a peace that take hold. 
 
I am proud to be your Commander in Chief and to thank
you on behalf of your nation. Your mission of peace
and goodwill in Bosnia reminds us all what this
season is all about for all people everywhere.
 
Tomorrow, on Christmas Day, and as long as you are
there, Hillary and I will have you in our thoughts
and prayers. May God bless and protect you and your
families and bring you success and a very safe
return. And may God bless America, the nation you do
so much to serve.

-RCMS: RCMS adopts DSDM methodology to implement
client/server projects in short time scales

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-RCMS: RCMS adopts DSDM
methodology to implement client/server projects in
short time scales
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

RCMS Computing Services Limited has announced that
its team of consultants has adopted the DSDM
Consortium methodology for the implementation of
Rapid Application Development (RAD) projects. RCMS
was a founder member of the Dynamic Systems
Development ethod (DSDM) Consortium which has laid
down a framework which enables organisations to make
up to 80 per cent time savings on client/server
implementation projects. 

RCMS has carried out several successful DSDM-based
RAD projects involving over 35 consultants. Examples
include projects for BUPA, the UK's leading
independent healthcare provider and Black Horse
Relocation Services, the UK market leader in
relocation anagement.

The DSDM approach to Rapid Application Development
assumes that no implementation project is built
perfectly the first time around but that it is
possible to produce 80 per cent of a solution in a
fraction of the time it takes to produce a whole
soluti n using traditional methods. The approach
takes advantage of an iterative approach which
encourages any previous implementation step to be
revisited as business requirements change at any
stage in the project. The DSDM Consortium was formed
in November 1993 to find a way of using RAD methods
more effectively to deliver business benefits.
Version 1.0 of the DSDM RAD methodology, launched in
February 1995, draws upon the collective development
and implementati n experiences of a large number of
companies involved in IT development projects. In
addition to RCMS, other founder members include
Oracle, IBM, Abbey Life, British Airways, and
Software AG. 

RCMS Computing Services Limited is one of the UK's
fastest growing systems and services integrators. The
company recently acquired the document management
company NBI Information Management Services Limited,
as part of its corporate growth objectives. 

RCMS specialises in developing client/server
enterprise-wide solutions for the corporate
marketplace and has achieved particular success in
the financial, manufacturing, retail and oil sectors,
with customers including The Royal Bank of Scotland,
Macro Group, Eagle Star, Black Horse Relocation
Services, BUPA, Abbey National, Amerada Hess and Bass
Taverns. RCMS is a major UK partner for leading IT
organisations, including Gupta, Thomson Software
Products, Oracle, Lotus, Platinum Technology, and
Micros ft.

Radio address by the President to the Nation

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Radio address by the
President to the Nation
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295 10:06 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. As you know, I have
spent the last week in intense discussion with
congressional leaders over how to balance the budget
in seven years. It's important to balance the budget
to lift the burden of debt from future generations. 

In the last three years, we've cut our deficit in
half, and we need to finish the job. But we have to
balance the budget in a way that reflects our most
fundamental values: increasing opportunity; asking
everyone to assume responsibility; strengthening our
families and the economy; and recognizing the duty we
owe to each other -- to our parents, our children,
and those who need and deserve our help. That's how
we've reduced the deficit since I took office --
cutting unnecessary programs, reducing the size of
the federal government by 200,000, reducing red tape,
but investing in education, the environment, research
and technology, protecting Medicare and Medicaid,
reducing taxes on the hardest-pressed working
families. It's worked. It's given us more jobs, more
new businesses, low inflation, and record economic
performance in the stock market and in many other
places. 
 
Now, that's how I want to finish the job of balancing
the budget. But even as we continue talking, I hope
Congress will agree to open the government and open
all the agencies that have closed so that we can end
the financial and emotional turmoil for more than
280,000 furloughed federal employees and 460,000
working but not getting paid federal employees.
 
In the spirit of the holidays, we should do
everything we can to put these people back to work
and to resume critical services the American people
need and deserve. Just last night, I signed
legislation that Congress passed yesterday to allow
3.3 million veterans and 13 million needy children
and their mothers to receive their benefits by
January 1st. That's a good start. I hope we can
resume all services as we work together to balance
the budget. 

Our talks are making progress. Yesterday we agreed to
resume our negotiations next week with the goal of
reaching an agreement as soon as possible. I am
confident we can end this impasse and pass a
seven-year balanced budget.
 
As we look back at this year, in this season of hope,
I think we ought to take just a little time to
reflect on the progress and accomplishment of
America. It should give us real optimism that we can
finish this budget job and go on to greater things in
1996. 

Nineteen ninety-five was a year in which our country
had the opportunity and the responsibility to play
our role as the world's premier peacemaker. Our
efforts opened the door to peace in places where only
rancor and war had previously existed. As a
peacemaker, not a policeman, we have helped the peace
process finally begin to take hold in the Middle
East, while we joined the world in mourning the
tragic assassination of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. We have done what Prime Minister Rabin
would have wanted us to do -- we've kept moving
forward.
 
And finally, it looks like Israel and Syria will sit
together in the United States to seek a way to
resolve their differences and live together
peacefully. We're also helping to bring peace to
Bosnia. The Dayton agreement and our decision to join
in the international effort to secure the peace in
Bosnia has given the people of the former Yugoslavia
a chance to rebuild their lives. After four long
years of horrible violence, America now has the
opportunity to lead in the effort to bring lasting
peace to that war-torn country and to stabilize
Central Europe as well.
 
In Northern Ireland, I saw thousands and thousands of
children beginning to celebrate their second
Christmas season of peace. And in Haiti, they will
soon celebrate the very first peaceful transfer of
power from one democratically-elected president to
another in the history of the country. And American
leadership helped to make both those celebrations
possible.
 
The seeds of peace are also sinking deeper roots
right here in America. We just learned that last year
our murder rate dropped 12 percent, the largest
decline in 35 years. Violent crime overall is down
five percent. Now, we know our work is far from done
on too many of our mean streets -- too many of our
children still are raising themselves, not being
taught right from wrong. There is still too much
crime and violence, and it's still rising among
teenagers in many parts of the country. But we are
beginning to turn the tide. And we do know what
works.
 
Much of the success is due to efforts in communities
throughout our country to get guns off our streets
and put more police on the streets, and to give our
young people something to say yes to as well as
something to say no to. More importantly it is due to
the outpouring of grass-roots community involvement
in all these efforts in the comprehensive fight
against crime and violence. 

People are getting the message that community
policing works. And it's up to every citizen to rise
up, reach out and link arms with local police to keep
their own neighborhoods safe and their schools safe.
Now, the progress we've seen is cause for hope. We
just have to keep working on it here at home.
 
From the Middle East to Northern Ireland, to our
troops in Bosnia, to our toughest neighborhoods,
America is leading the way to peace and
reconciliation. All around the world billions of
people look to America as a model of democracy and
freedom. And we should see ourselves as others see
us. We should finish the job of balancing the budget
and reopening the government in the spirit of
cooperation and unity so that we can continue to grow
and prosper together and be a force in the world for
peace and freedom. That is the spirit of the season
and the spirit of America.
 
Let each of us resolve to do what we can to be
peacemakers. Let us bring peace to every child who
deserves to be free from violence and full of hope.
And as we celebrate the birth of a child whose only
shelter was the straw of a manger, let us remember
the words of the Prince of Peace who said, "Blessed
are the peacemakers." We ask the blessings of this
peace for everyone. That is our prayer this
Christmas.
 
Thanks for listening.

-CHARLES RIVER MEDIA: Internet WatchDog - Internet
and computer monitoring software

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-CHARLES RIVER MEDIA:
Internet WatchDog - Internet and computer monitoring
software -- Charles River Media releases tool to
assist parents, teachers and employers in monitoring
appropriate use of computers and the Internet
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

Rockland, MA - Charles River Media announces Internet
WatchDog for PC and Macintosh computers. Designed for
managers, parents and teachers, Internet WatchDog is
a productivity and monitoring tool for the Internet
and personal computers. Internet WatchDog does not
censor what is being displayed, rather it makes a
record for later viewing by authorized individuals.
This multipurpose utility provides detailed
monitoring of any PC or Macintosh. For the first
time, parents, teachers and employers will be able to
view the activities taking place on their computers
without arbitrarily limiting access to the Internet
or creating a false sense of security by simply
"blocking" certain sites or keywords. As new sites
are added to the Internet everyday, it is impossible
to "block" unsuitable Internet activity. Internet
WatchDog allows the parent, teacher or employer to
monitor computer use - much like a telephone bill
enables the caller to see a listing of phone numbers.

Developed by Algorithm Inc., Internet WatchDog
functions by capturing screen and other information
"intelligently" while the computer is running. You
will be able to review a grid-like screen with a
series of thumbnail screen captures. For a closer
look, you can see any screen capture full-size just
by clicking on it. In addition, Internet WatchDog
records usage of all software applications - Internet
related or other computer activity. A password is
required to access the monitoring capabilities of the
program, and any attempt to circumvent or tamper with
the Internet WatchDog is also recorded. 

Features
* Helps you monitor the complete Internet -- Internet
WatchDog shows you all activity, regardless of the
type. Visit the World Wide Web (WWW), e-mail, file
transfer protocol (FTP), gopher, Internet relay chat
(IRC), or the ever popular material in UseNet
Newsgroups -- the Internet WatchDog is alert and
ready to go;

* Compliments existing blocking software -- Internet
WatchDog can monitor your PC computing system for
access to any of the current and/or future Internet
sites containing questionable material; 

* Includes "Tips for Parents" section on children's
use of the Internet;

* Internet WatchDog will "intelligently" determine
when to take snapshots of your screen so that
regardless of the activity (whether on-line to the
Internet or not), you will know how your computer is
being used;
* Runs in the background without interruptions;

* Tamper-evident with password protection monitors
and records any attempt to disable or elude the
program;

* Records which software applications were used and
when - Internet WatchDog can help you to determine
which programs are in use on a particular system.

* Locates graphics files - Internet WatchDog scans
the extent of your hard disk to help you find
suspicious graphics files, whether or not they are
hidden!

* Learning to use Internet WatchDog is simple - the
software includes a guided tour of features and
instructions;

* Free Technical Support - 800 number or e-mail
address.

AGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners -- Situation and
outlook
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Summary
World sugar production and consumption for 1995/96
are forecast at record levels of 117.9 and 116.6
million metric tons, respectively. The implied
surplus of 1.3 million tons for 1995/96, together
with a somewhat smaller surplus estimated for
1994/95, allows a modest rebuilding of global stocks
and puts downward pressure on world prices. The
surplus in 1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar
deficits.
 
Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation and
Outlook report, world sugar production and
consumption were revised downward by 380,000 and
450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downward
adjustment in global production reflects reduced
production prospects for the United States, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offset
the improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, and
Thailand. Also, downward revisions in key consuming
countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, more
than offset increased consumption prospects by other
leading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand.
 
With world stocks and the stocks-to-consumption ratio
expected to rise, world prices could face downward
pressure. The spot price in late 1995 is more than 2
cents a pound below a year ago. Prices averaged 11.94
cents a pound (Contract No. 11, spot basis) in
October, 11.96 cents in November, and 12.39 cents for
the first 11 market days of December (through
December 15). 

Brazil's sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
a record 13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last
season because more cane is being used for sugar and
less for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar
production, driven by the demand for exports,
occurred in the Center-South region. Sugar production
in the Northeast is forecast unchanged from last
season. Many processing facilities that had produced
only alcohol have been converted to regular sugar
mills with annexed distilleries for fuel alcohol
production. Brazil now has 370 processing facilities
to produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.
About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce only
fuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.
Brazil's sugar consumption is forecast at 8.1 million
tons, the highest in Latin America and the fifth
highest in the world behind only India, the European
Union (EU), the United States and China. Brazil's raw
and refined sugar exports are forecast at a record
4.8 million tons, the world's largest.
 
U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96
(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million short
tons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the record
outturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeet
production is expected to total 28.9 million tons, a
decrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,
at 1.42 million acres, is 1.2 percent below last
year. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons per
acre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet spring
got the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start and
lowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problems
in Michigan and late season harvest problems in parts
of the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, have
caused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast from
the September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 million
tons, raw value, 393,000 tons less than the record
1994/95 crop. 

The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partially
offset by an increase in the forecast for cane sugar
production to 3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from
earlier forecasts due to the improved outlook for
sugarcane yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite
these upward revisions, the overall outlook for cane
sugar is expected to be down slightly from 1994/95,
reflecting a further contraction in the Hawaiian
sugar industry.
 
The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchanged
at 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tons
or about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand growth
appears to be running only slightly ahead of
population growth, compared with the 1.6 percent
growth rate of recent years. Reduced demand growth is
attributed to encroachment of high fructose corn
syrup (HFCS) into traditional sugar markets and
weaker demand for confectionery and bakery
products--major industrial users of sugar. Sugar use
expanded an average of 164,000 tons per year over the
last decade (fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), following the
major contraction in sugar use in the early 1980's
due to the substitution of HFCS for sugar in soft
drinks.
 
Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,
the Secretary of Agriculture, on November 9,
increased the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ)
for raw cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000
metric tons). This action raised the TRQ to 1.56
million short tons, and total supply (carryin stocks,
production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,
comparable with the 11.1 million forecast in
September. 
 
U.S. raw cane sugar prices averaged 23.21 cents a
pound in September and 22.67 cents in October
(Contract No. 14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent
above the level for the same months in 1994. Since
the quota increase, prices have remained firm,
averaging 22.60 cents a pound for November and 22.64
cents for the first 11 market days of December. As
indicated in USDA's press release of November 9
announcing the quota change, USDA will continue
monitoring import requirements and will adjust the
TRQ accordingly. 

Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach
11.2 million tons in fiscal year 1995/96 of which
U.S. production is expected to supply 98 percent. The
United States supplements domestically produced corn
sweetener supplies with imports, mainly from Canada.
USDA forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons,
up 3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecast
for HFCS is based on projections of deliveries from
domestic production and imports. Using a U.S.
population of 269.2 million (including Puerto Rico),
domestic HFCS use is forecast at 59.3 pounds in
fiscal 1995/96, up from 57.7 pounds for last year,
and 45.2 pounds a decade ago. Per capita sugar
consumption is forecast somewhat higher at 64.6
pounds, refined basis.

HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and
16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis, respectively,
for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For the
June through September period, prices for HFCS-55
averaged 18.51 cents a pound, and HFCS-42 prices
averaged 16.62 cents. In the past, prices moved up
sharply during the summer due to the high demand for
HFCS from the beverage sector which pushed processing
capacity to the limit. However, this past summer,
while demand was strong due to unusually hot summer
temperatures in many parts of the country, prices did
not move up. This reflects added corn sweetener
processing capacity--as much as 25 percent according
to some estimates--that has come on line in the last
year. With the very sharp downturn in this season's
corn crop, higher HFCS prices have increased. HFCS-55
prices averaged 19.68 cents a pound in October, and
20.84 cents in November and for the first 2 weeks of
December. For fiscal 1994/95, wholesale HFCS-55
averaged 18.81 cents a pound compared with 25.26
cents for refined beet sugar. The 6.45 cent price
spread between HFCS and refined beet sugar for
1994/95 contrasts to the 2.73 cents the year before.
For fiscal 1995/96, it is likely that the price
spread between HFCS-55 and sugar will narrow
somewhat. 
 
World Sugar
Overview
World sugar production and consumption for 1995/96
are forecast at 117.9 and 116.6 million metric tons,
respectively. 1/, 2/ The implied surplus of 1.3
million tons for 1995/96, together with a somewhat
smaller surplus estimated for 1994/95, allows a
modest rebuilding of global stocks. The surplus in
1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar deficits (figure
1). With world stocks expected to be higher coupled
with a higher stocks-to-consumption ratio, world
prices could face downward pressure. Current spot
prices are 12.4 cents a pound, more than 2 cents
below a year ago. 
 
Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation and
Outlook report, world sugar production and
consumption were revised downward by 380,000 and
450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downward
adjustment in global production reflects reduced
production prospects for the United States, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offset
the improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, and
Thailand. Also, downward revisions in key consuming
countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, more
than offset increased consumption prospects by other
leading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand.
 
Production
World Record Production Forecast 
 
The 1995/96 estimate of world sugar production is a
record 117.9 million tons, raw value, 2 percent above
the revised 1994/95 outturn of 115.6 million, and 1
percent above the previous record of 116.4 million
set in 1991/92. This production forecast is less than
many other analysts are forecasting because USDA
expects India's output to decline. Sugar produced
from sugarcane is estimated at a record 81.5 million
tons, up marginally from a year ago. Sugar processed
from sugarbeets is estimated at 36.4 million tons, up
5 percent from last season.
 
Over the past decade cane, sugar production has been
trending up. The expansion from an average of 66.4
million tons annually during the second half of the
1980's, to more than 80 million tons the last 2
years, is largely attributed to growth in harvested
area. In contrast, yields and recovery rates have
been fairly steady at around 60 to 61 tons per
hectare and 10 percent, respectively. For 1995/96,
USDA estimates that a record 12.8 million hectares of
sugarcane for sugar will be harvested around the
globe compared with 10.9 million in the late 1980's
(figure 2). Among the major producing countries
contributing to the global expansion have been
Australia, Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Thailand.
 
Beet sugar area, in contrast, has generally declined
to a decade low of 7.7 million hectares in 1995/96,
compared with 8.6 million in the second half of the
1980's. The downturn was largely in the Russian
Federation and Ukraine. Higher recovery rates
reflecting improved seeds, heightened use of
production inputs, and greater factory efficiencies
somewhat offset the area decline. 

Production Prospects in Selected Countries:
Mexico--Sugar production during 1995/96 is forecast
at 4.3 million tons, down 7 percent from last
season's record output of 4.6 million. The decrease
primarily reflects the return to a more normal cane
yield of 72.5 tons per hectare, following last
season's unusually high yield of 78.4 tons per
hectare.
 
Brazil--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last season
because more cane is being used for sugar and less
for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar production,
driven by the demand for exports, occurred in the
Center-South region. Sugar production in the
Northeast is forecast unchanged from last season.
Many processing facilities that had produced only
alcohol have been converted to regular sugar mills
with annexed distilleries for fuel alcohol
production. Brazil has 370 processing facilities to
produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.
About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce only
fuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.
 
Cuba--The 1995/96 estimate pegs sugar output at 4.0
million tons, up 21 percent from last season's 50
year low of 3.3 million. The turnaround is due to the
increased availability of inputs, such as fuel,
fertilizers, chemicals, and replacement parts for
machinery. The inputs were financed by foreign loans,
secured by the anticipated increase in sugar output. 

European Union (EU)--Sugar production during the
1995/96 season is estimated up 3 percent from last
year, to 17.0 million tons, because of a 2-percent
increase in harvested area and improved yields. In
France, sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up
5 percent, to 4.6 million tons, accounting for 27
percent of the EU total. The increase is due to a
5-percent increase in harvested area. For the second
consecutive year, France suffered through a hot, dry
summer which hit the sugarbeet growing areas
particularly hard. This limited beet growth and
resulted in a smaller-than-average beet weight.
However, because planting conditions were nearly
ideal, a record number of beets were sown per
hectare. In Germany, the EU's second largest
producer, sugar production during 1995/96 is
estimated at 4.2 million tons, 5 percent above last
year. The upturn reflects a 3-percent increase in
harvested area and a 5-percent increase in the
average beet yield. Although the hot summer weather
throughout the EU did not cause major damage to the
bulk of the beet crop, beets grown in the sandy-soil
regions of northern and eastern Germany were
adversely affected by the heat. Rains during the
latter part of August helped to offset part of the
moisture deficit.
 
Russia--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
1.9 million tons, 15 percent above 1994/95. Sugarbeet
production for 1995/96 is forecast at 19.0 million
tons, up 36 percent from a year ago. The increase in
sugarbeet production is due to a 38-percent increase
in beet yield per hectare compared with 1994/95,
which returns Russia's average beet yield to a more
normal level.
 
Ukraine--Sugar production for 1995/96 increased from
last season's drought-reduced crop, but remains well
below pre-independence levels because of a shortage
of farm equipment, low availability and high price
for farm chemicals, and poor maintainence of
sugarbeet factories.
 
China--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up 8
percent, to 6.5 million tons, because of a
significant expansion in sugarbeet and sugarcane
area. In Guangxi, the province in China that produces
the largest volume of sugarcane, the area planted to
sugarcane increased 53,400 hectares; in Yunnan,
another major producing province, planted area is up
15,400 hectares. In total, the area harvested for
sugarcane is estimated up 8 percent from last season,
and sugar from cane is estimated up 6 percent to 5.3
million tons. China's 1995/96 sugar production from
beets is estimated up 20 percent from last year to
1.2 million tons. Harvested beet area is forecast up
16 percent over last year, to 672,000 hectares. The
increase in sugarbeet area is taking place primarily
in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Provinces. With a per
hectare yield 4 times higher than that of
Heilongjiang Province, Xinjiang is expected to
replace Heilongjiang as the largest producer of
sugarbeets this year. 

India--Sugar output is forecast to decrease in
1995/96 to 15.2 million tons, down 7 percent from the
record 1994/95 sugar crop of 16.3 million tons. A
month delay in the onset of the 1995 monsoon season
in many areas, combined with variable rainfall in key
growing states will likely lower cane yields. Also,
in 1995/96, the Indian government is expected to lift
gur (crude brown non-centrifugal sugar) stock holding
limits, which will likely decrease the volume of cane
diverted to centrifugal sugar production. Moreover,
cane diversion to the production of khandsari (a low
recovery centrifugal sugar) is expected to decrease
again in 1995/96, due to reduced demand for this
product from the alcohol industry. Overall, undefined
market and policy factors, such as those that
determine the diversion of sugarcane between gur and
centrifugal sugar, including khandsari, will play a
significant role in determining the final mill sugar
production level in 1995/96. Despite the expected
downturn, India is forecast to be the world's largest
sugar producer (excluding the EU).
 
Thailand--Sugar production for the 1995/96 season is
estimated at a record 5.7 million tons, up 5 percent
from 1994/95 because beneficial rainfall is likely to
result in a record-breaking sugarcane crop of 54.0
million tons. Additionally, crop quality is improving
in Thailand as growers increasingly switch to new
varieties that have higher sucrose content. The
number of factories in Thailand remains stable at 46
because the Government banned construction of
additional mills. However, the Government has given
permission to expand crushing capacities and to
relocate mills. As a result of this policy,
Thailand's milling capacity has greatly expanded. In
addition, a number of mills have been relocated from
cane-deficit zones in the Central and Eastern regions
to cane-surplus zones in the Northern and
Northeastern regions.
 
Australia--Sugar output for 1995/96 is estimated at
4.9 million tons, down 3 percent from last season's
record of 5.1 million. The area harvested in 1995/96
is pegged at 373,000 hectares, up 9,000 hectares from
last season. However, dry weather in some growing
areas reduced the volume of sugarcane produced. And,
unseasonal rains, which closed more than half of
Australia's mills for nearly 3 weeks midway through
the processing season, reduced the sugar content of
the harvested cane. Nevertheless, the decline in
sugar production in the drought-affected southern
growing regions during 1995/96 will be more than
offset by increased production in the expanding
Burdekin and northern growing areas (figure 3).
 
Consumption
Global Consumption Forecast Lowered
World sugar consumption in 1995/96 has been revised
down to 116.6 million tons, about 450,000 tons below
the September forecast. Slower than expected growth
in domestic sugar demand in Brazil, Russia, and
Indonesia account for most of the revisions.
Nevertheless, the revised record 1995/96 world sugar
consumption forecast is 2.1 million tons or 1.8
percent above the 1994/95 estimate. Increased sugar
consumption is expected in countries in Central and
South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The
rise is due to a mix of factors, including lower
prices, higher consumer incomes, population growth,
and rising demand for sugar containing products such
as soft drinks and processed foods. In Asia, which
today accounts for over 30 percent of world sugar
use, sugar consumption has increased more than 20
percent over the last decade, from 27.8 million tons
in 1985/86 to a forecast of 40.0 million in 1995/96
(figure 4).
 
Over the last decade, global sugar consumption growth
has been about 1.2 percent per year, down from 2
percent from the previous decade. In contrast to the
overall growth in global sugar consumption,
year-to-year growth has been weak or non-existent in
many of the world's industrialized economies in North
America, Europe, and Japan where population growth is
slow, sugar markets are mature, and alternative
caloric sweeteners and high intensity sweeteners are
popular. For 1995/96, sugar consumption growth in the
United States is forecast at only 1 percent, while
Canada's use is expected to decline due to increased
use of lower priced corn sweeteners and a fall-off in
exports of sugar containing products. The EU's sugar
use is relatively stagnant at 14.0 million tons, as
is Japan's at 2.4 million. 
In Central Europe and the countries of the former
Soviet Union, sugar consumption forecasts are
relatively unchanged between 1994/95 and 1995/96, but
are sharply lower compared with the late 1980's or
early 1990's. Many of these formerly centrally
planned economies continue to undergo painful
economic transitions, increased retail sugar prices,
and high unemployment. 

Trade
Trade Forecast Raised
The 1995/96 world sugar trade forecast was revised up
2 percent to 31.3 million tons. Increased export
prospects in Brazil, Ukraine, Thailand, and Cuba
account for most of the higher 1995/96 sugar trade
forecast, which is almost 1 million tons more than
the revised 1994/95 trade estimates. World sugar
trade in 1994/95 was revised due to higher export
availabilities in the EU and India.
 
Larger sugar export supplies in 1995/96 in Brazil,
Thailand, Cuba, Ukraine, and Guatemala will likely
account for most of the increase in world sugar
exports this season. These countries' higher exports
should offset lower forecasts for leading exporters
such as Australia and the EU. Anticipated lower sugar
production in Australia could hamper its export
availabilities, while the need to rebuilt stocks will
limit the EU's sugar shipments. In recent years,
Brazil, Thailand, and Australia have substituted for
decreased Cuban sugar exports in world markets
(figure 5).
 
Increased sugar imports in the United States, Russia,
and the Philippines will be a major factor in the
anticipated increase in world sugar trade in 1995/96.
China will continue to be a major importer.
 
The structure of world sugar trade continues to be
highly concentrated on the export side compared with
imports. The top six exporters for 1990/91-
1994/95--EU, Australia, Brazil, Thailand, Cuba, and
Ukraine--accounted for about 70 percent of world
exports. The top six importers--Russian Federation,
EU, China, United States, Japan, and South
Korea--accounted for about 40 percent of global
imports.
 
Total sugar trade over the past decade has oscillated
within a fairly narrow band between 27 and 33 million
tons. Nonetheless, sugar continues to be among the
world's most heavily traded agricultural commodities.
In 1994/95, about 26 percent of world sugar
production was traded, compared with 5 percent of
paddy rice, 21 percent of wheat, 14 percent of corn,
and 25 percent of soybeans. In contrast, 81 percent
of coffee production was traded. By volume, the 30
million tons of sugar traded in 1994/95 was exceeded
only by wheat (96 million) and corn (58 million), and
was about equal to soybean trade (31 million).
 
Of the roughly 30 million tons of sugar traded last
year about half was raw cane sugar and the other half
refined beet and cane sugar. Major raw cane sugar
exporters are Australia, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa,
and Thailand. Their markets include the United
States, Japan, and the EU and a wide set of other
countries--some of which import raw cane sugar and
reexport refined sugar--such as China, South Korea,
and also the United States. The EU has been the major
supplier of refined sugar, but in recent years
countries such as Brazil and Turkey have become
important sources of supply. Leading markets for
refined sugar continue to be the Middle East and the
Russian Federation. Over the past decade, refined
sugar trade has grown from about 9 million tons or 35
percent of world trade to about 15 million tons or 50
percent of the global sugar market last year.
 
Stocks and Prices
USDA forecasts stocks at the end of 1995/96 at 20.8
million tons, the highest since 1992/93. The
stocks-to-use ratio is forecast at 17.9 percent, up
from a low of 16.4 percent 2 years ago (figure 6).
Prospects of large crops this year will facilitate
the rebuilding of stocks in a number of countries,
including the EU, particularly France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Argentina, Colombia, and Zimbabwe. China
and India's stocks are expected to be large, allowing
China to reduce imports and India to export.
 
World spot prices for raw sugar (f.o.b. Caribbean
contract No. 11) averaged 12.39 cents a pound for the
first 11 market days of December (through December
15), compared with 11.94 and 11.96 cents a pound in
October and November. This compares with prices a
year ago of 14.57 for the first half of December, and
12.75 and 13.88 cents for October and November. 

Prices are likely to weaken into the spring due to
the outlook for a record 1995/96 global sugar crop,
and a further buildup in world sugar stocks. A
forecast record 1995/96 crop in Thailand and reduced
sugar consumption in Russia will make them key
countries to watch. Prospects for record 1995/96
global sugar consumption, relatively low world sugar
carryover stocks, possible higher imports by Russia,
larger 1995/96 imports by the United States, and
strong Middle Eastern import demand, could provide
support to futures prices in the next few months.
 
Analyzing world sugar prices for the past decade,
USDA data indicate years of low prices--6.0 cents a
pound in 1985/86 and 1986/87--coinciding with a
build-up of world stocks and 2 years--1989/90 and
1994/95--when prices moved up to near 14 cents a
pound when stocks were drawn down. However, a major
price spike did not occur, in fact the last major
price increase occurred in 1981/82 when world prices
averaged around 23 cents a pound. USDA believes the
conditions which led to past world sugar price spikes
have been largely removed since 1982. These changes
include:
 
* The bulk of import demand on the world market is no
longer from high-income, price-inelastic countries
but from poorer, price-elastic countries; i.e., they
have to stop buying when the price rises. o Corn
sweeteners now provide a viable substitute to sugar
in many countries (such as the United States, Japan,
and Canada). High intensity sweeteners are also a
factor in the United States, Japan, Western Europe
and China (i.e. unusally high use of saccharin in
recent years in China). The increased availability of
substitutes has greatly increased the price
elasticity of sugar demand; i.e. customers can switch
to the substitute if the prices rise. o Policy reform
has occurred in many countries (such as Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Eastern Europe and
Mexico) which has increased price transmission to
internal markets.
 
Previous world sugar price spikes led to expansion of
global sugar capacity and periods of relatively low
prices. If there are no future world price spikes,
there also will not be the tendency for prices to go
as low. 

Colombia: Growth in Production and Exports
by Nydia R. Suarez*
 
*The author is an agricultural economist in the
Commercial Agriculture Division, Economic Research
Service, USDA.
 
Colombia has displayed strong sugar production growth
in the last 10 years, underpinned by expanded area,
improved yields, and increased use of varieties with
high sucrose content. Production jumped from 1.2
million tons raw value in the mid-1980's to a record
2.04 million tons in 1994/95. USDA's production
forecast for 1995/96 is 2.07 million tons. This
forecast assumes normal weather conditions and
yields, and only 1 percent growth in area. Expansion
may be slowing, as Colombian producers anticipate
lower world prices in the next few years.
 
Colombia's sugar production is concentrated in the
Cauca Valley where cane is planted and harvested year
round and cane milling is spread evenly throughout
the year. Thus, a relatively small cane milling
infrastructure is needed to produce the same amount
of sugar produced in other countries, giving Colombia
a competitive advantage. Colombia, Hawaii, and Peru
are the only places in the world that cultivate
sugarcane year round, Colombia being the largest
producer. Colombian farmers have continued their
efforts to raise yields to boost overall production
with the aid of the Cenicana Research Institute.
Sugar area cannot be expanded much more without a
drop in average yields. This is why the trend toward
greater use of disease-resistant cane varieties
continues. Experts in the field forecast that by the
year 2000 more than 60 percent of the centrifugal
sugarcane area will be planted to a variety that is
highly resistant to both rust and smut diseases.
Also, cane and sugar yield for this variety are
higher than the older varieties, and sugar extraction
yields are reportedly 12 percent higher. Colombia has
one of the highest productivity rates and one of the
lowest costs in the world. Colombia has consistently
been among the world's most efficient producers and
possesses one of the world's most competitive sugar
industries. According to cost data developed by LMC
International, Colombia ranked 6th among 62 world
sugarcane producing countries during the period
1987/88-91/92. From 1979/80 to 1991/92, Colombia
enjoyed total production costs that were nearly 25
percent lower than the global cane average.
Colombia's average factory costs were the lowest in
the world in 1987/88-91/92 due to its year-round
milling. Colombia also performs well at the field
level. Average field costs in 1987/88 to 1991/92 were
the 8th lowest among 62 world sugarcane producing
countries. This compared with a ranking of 26th from
1983/84 to 1987/88.
 
Besides centrifugal sugar, Colombia produces crude,
non-centrifugal sugar called panela. Although area
planted to cane for panela is almost 2 times larger
than the area for centrifugal sugar, panela
production is only two-thirds of the amount of
centrifugal sugar. Cane for panela production is
grown mostly by small farmers using traditional
methods. Their yields cannot compare with those
obtained by large commercial producers of cane for
centrifugal sugar who have access to modern
technology, equipment, and disease resistant
varieties. 
 
Colombia's centrifugal sugar consumption for 1994/95
is estimated at 1.22 million tons, up 3 percent from
the previous year and 6 percent higher than the
1985/86-89/90 average. In addition to the population
growth, sugar use increased because sugar retail
prices increased less than the growth in the consumer
price index. For 1995/96 and the next 3-5 years,
consumption is expected to increase about 2 percent
per year, the same as the population growth rate. In
addition, Colombia consumed more than 1 million tons
of panela. This amount varies with the price of
panela vis-a-vis white sugar. In September 1991,
panela and white sugar prices were the same, but 2
years later, the panela price was 24 percent lower
and by 1995, the difference is forecast at 40
percent. Another factor that affects consumption is
the unemployment rate. As it declines consumption of
white sugar increases as disposable income increases. 
 
Colombian sugar exports currently account for about
one-third of total output. Colombia began exporting
raw sugar in 1961 when world prices were attractive
and the country had plenty of exportable sugar.
Stimulated by favorable world prices, Colombia's
sugar exports grew steadily until 1982, and then
began to fall as world prices dropped. In 1987
exports were only 96,000 tons or 55 percent lower
than the previous year. Sugar exports during 1985-89
averaged a little more than 230,000 tons per year,
with the United States receiving almost two-thirds of
the total.
 
A shift in export distribution occurred in 1991 when
the Andean-Pact countries opened their borders to
certain products, including sugar. Exports to
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela represent more than 50
percent of Colombia's exports for 1990-94. The United
States dropped to 26 percent. In January 1992,
Colombia and Venezuela established the Andean
region's first binational custom union to apply a
common external tariff. Colombia and Venezuela's
bilateral trade accord for several agricultural
commodities was expanded by the Group of Three (G3)
Agreement to include Mexico. Under this Agreement,
the Colombian Government is negotiating with Mexico
over the possibility of exporting Colombia sugar to
Mexico duty free in exchange for a gradual reduction
of Colombian import tariffs for fruits, vegetables,
pulses, and orange juice imported from Mexico. Major
changes in Colombia's trade policy orientation are
expected from either future NAFTA accession or
participation in a Western Hemisphere Trade
Agreement.
 
U.S. Sweeteners
Overview
U.S. Sweetener Market Expands
 
The U.S. caloric sweetener complex, the world's
largest and most diverse in terms of consumer
products, continues to expand in quantity and
variety. Use of refined sugar, corn sweeteners (HFCS,
glucose, and dextrose), honey, maple syrup, and
edible molasses in 1995, will likely total 19.7
million short tons, compared with 19.3 million last
year, and 15.5 million in 1985. This expansion
reflects growth in the U.S. population (including
Puerto Rico) to over 269 million in 1995, up from 242
million in 1985; increased income; and changes in
consumer lifestyles and tastes.
 
Total per capita use of caloric sweeteners in the
United States is forecast at 148 pounds in 1995,
compared with 146 last year, and 128 in 1985. Refined
sugar use in 1995 is expected to account for 43.7
percent of the total per capita use or 64.6 pounds,
while corn sweeteners should represent 55.3 percent
or 81.8 pounds. Growth of corn sweetener use per
capita continues to outpace the growth of sugar use,
a trend established over the last decade. 

In addition, caloric sweeteners are increasingly
supplemented by high- intensity (low-calorie)
sweeteners, mainly aspartame, saccharin, and
acesulfame-k. This segment of the industry is
changing rapidly because of new uses for high
intensity sweeteners approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the prospective introduction of
new high intensity sweeteners, and growth in the
number and availability of "light" foods sweetened
with high-intensity sweeteners.
 
Domestic supplies of sweeteners are also supplemented
with imports of sugar, HFCS, honey, maple syrup, and
aspartame. Import levels change from year- to-year,
largely based on weather-related production
conditions, prices, and Government policy. U.S.
sweeteners are also exported in significant
quantities. For calendar 1994, U.S. exports of
refined sugar totaled 480,000 tons, raw value; HFCS,
118,000 tons; honey 8.3 million pounds; and maple
syrup, 569,000 gallons. 
 
The U.S. sweetener industry also generates valuable
byproducts. From the U.S. beet and cane sugar
industry, the key byproducts are molasses, beet pulp,
and bagasse from sugarcane milling. Domestically
produced molasses is used as an animal feed. Imports
supplement domestic supplies. Imports of industrial
or feed molasses were at a record 1.8 million tons
last year, but are expected to fall in 1995 due to
increased demand and higher prices in Asia and
Europe. A large share of beet pulp production is
shipped to Asian markets. Bagasse is mainly used as
mill fuel. The corn wet milling process, in addition
to sweeteners, produces the byproducts of corn oil,
corn gluten meal, and corn gluten feed. Corn gluten
feed, in particular, has a large market in the EU.
 
U.S. Sugar
Production
Beet Sugar Production Lower
U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96
(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million short
tons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the record
outturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeet
production is expected to total 28.9 million tons, a
decrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,
at 1.42 million acres, is down 1.2 percent from last
year. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons per
acre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet spring
got the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start and
lowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problems
in Michigan and late season harvest problems in parts
of the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, have
caused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast from
the September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 million
tons, raw value, 55 percent of U.S. sugar production
and 393,000 tons less than the record 1994/95 crop. 

The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partially
offset by an increase in the cane sugar forecast to
3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from an earlier
forecast due to the improved outlook for sugarcane
yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite these upward
revisions, the overall outlook for cane sugar is
expected to be down slightly from 1994/95, reflecting
a further contraction in the Hawaiian sugar industry.
 
Over the past decade (fiscal 1985/86 - 1994/95), the
growth trend for U.S. beet sugar production has been
128,000 tons per year, while the growth trend for
cane sugar production has been 20,000 tons per year
(figures 7 and 8). Beet sugar has increased its share
of U.S. sugar production from 49 percent in 1985/86
to a record 57 percent in 1994/95. Growth in beet
acreage in the upper Midwest States of Minnesota and
North Dakota has been a major contributing factor in
the expansion of U.S. beet sugar production (figure
9). Cane sugar's reduced share is largely due to the
sharp contraction in Hawaii's production (figure 10).
 
Developments in the Beet Sugar Producing Region
For the 1995 Crop 3/

3/ The sugarcane harvest is still underway in all
sugarcane producing States. Detailed analysis of the
crop will appear in the March 1996 Sugar and
Sweetener report.

The 1995/96 sugarbeet harvest has been completed with
the exception of the upcoming spring harvest in
California. As of mid-December, beet processors
outside California are continuing their slicing
campaigns largely from piled beets. The major
remaining threat to the crop would be possible
deterioration of sucrose levels in beet piles over
the next several months due to alternating freezing
and thawing of piles which can occur during wide
swings in temperatures. This season's harvested
tonnage and sucrose levels were adversely affected by
weather and crop disease problems. Developments in
the various growing regions are as follows:
 
Great Lakes--Sugarbeet acreage in Michigan and Ohio
for 1995/96 was 204,200 acres, up marginally from
last year due to increased acreage in Michigan that
offsets a decline in Ohio. Yields were expected to
average 16.0 tons per acre, comparable with last
year, but 4 tons below the national average. Industry
sources indicate that sucrose content was 16.4 to
17.5 percent. USDA estimates total tonnage to be
processed at 3.28 million tons. Regional sugarbeet
processing plants concentrated in the Saginaw Valley
of Michigan (five) and Fremont, Ohio (one) began
their slicing campaigns in early October and will run
through the end of January in Michigan and
mid-December in Ohio. 

Agronomically, the 1995 crop proved challenging.
Significant spring rains in April and May delayed
plantings. However, beet emergence was excellent and
combined with closer seed spacing, provided above
average beet populations. Climatic conditions through
the summer months provided below normal precipitation
and above normal temperatures. Coupled with a heavy
infestation of root aphids in the Michigan growing
area, these conditions had a negative effect on
yields and beet quality. Despite wet conditions and
temperatures that were alternately too warm or too
cold, about 80 percent of the harvest was completed
by November 1. Most of the remaining beets were
harvested under wet and freezing conditions during
the first 3 weeks of November.
 
Red River Valley and Southern Minnesota--Sugarbeet
harvested area in Minnesota and North Dakota is
estimated by USDA at a record 625,000 acres for
1995/96, up 2 percent from the previous season and
equal to 44 percent of the national beet acreage.
Yields, however, are down in Minnesota by 10 percent
to 18.5 tons per acre and 9 percent in North Dakota
to 19.3 tons reflecting generally adverse conditions
both at planting and harvest. Total beet tonnage
harvested for the two States is estimated at 11.7
million tons versus 12.7 million tons for 1994/95.
Processing of the crop is underway at six beet
factories in the Red River Valley and one at an
adjacent area in southwestern Minnesota. The last
processing plant in the region is expected to
complete its slicing campaign by mid-April.
 
In the Red River Valley the 1995 planting season
experienced a late start due to excessive soil
moisture and wet spring weather. To offset expected
yield reduction due to late plantings, acreage was
increased 3 percent. After planting was completed in
late May, warm, humid weather with frequent rains
prevailed through August and September. Reflecting
the warm and moist soil conditions, root rot diseases
such as aphanomyces and rhizoctonia were more
prevalent this year. Also, cercospora leafspot
infections were reported to be the most severe since
the early 1980's. Restricted harvest started in
mid-September and full harvest started the first week
of October. Sugar content was negatively influenced
by excessive rainfall during harvest, an early
killing frost (September 23), and heavy cercospora
pressure. 

In the southwestern Minnesota growing area, wet
conditions in the spring delayed plantings. For
example, by May 2 only 13 percent of the crop was
planted versus the normal 52 percent. As a result,
yield expectations were reduced due to a lack of
significant early planted acres. Compounding the slow
start of the crop, heavy rains during late June and
early July caused severe retardation of root
development. In the summer months, temperature and
humidity conditions were ideal for development of
cercospora leafspot. Despite multiple applications of
fungicides, significant leaf damage resulted from the
intense infection which further reduced yield and
sugar accumulation.
 
Harvest was delayed until mid-September to allow the
crop additional time to mature. October was
punctuated with additional rainstorms, and finally
three snowstorms near the final week. Several growers
were unable to complete harvest before the soil froze
to a depth of 4 to 6 inches. This resulted in
additional lost acres and reduced tonnage, not all of
which are reflected in current USDA data.
 
Northwest--The Idaho and Oregon 1995/96 sugarbeet
crops were harvested from 216,000 acres, marginally
lower than 1994/95. Yields are estimated at 25 tons
per acre, down more than 2 tons from last year. USDA
estimates beet tonnage at 4.95 million tons for
Idaho, down 12 percent from last year's record, and
464,000 tons in Oregon, comparable with last year.
The slicing campaigns got underway at the region's
four plants (three in Idaho and one in eastern
Oregon) in mid-September and are expected to be
finished by early February.
 
A wetter-than-normal spring delayed plantings
somewhat. However, the wet conditions were favorable
for germination and crop establishment, resulting in
very good stands and high per-acre populations.
Cooler-than-normal temperatures prevailed throughout
the growing season and resulted in considerably
below-normal heat unit accumulation for the season.
While this retarded crop development, it also reduced
irrigation water demand. In addition, the season's
coolness created conditions less favorable for
yield-reducing rhizomania's development. Weather
during harvest was nearly ideal, facilitating a
relatively smooth harvest season and enabling beets
to go into storage piles for processing in good
condition.
 
In addition to the traditional growing areas, the
Northwest has a relatively new growing area in the
Moses Lake section of central Washington.
Approximately 7,500 acres were harvested in the Moses
Lake area starting in mid-October. Yields are
reported to be over 30 tons per acre, reflecting the
area's highly fertile soil.
 
Since this growing area does not have a mill close
by, beets are shipped by rail to Nampa, Idaho, and
Hamilton City, California, for processing. But a
November 3 industry press release indicated that this
mode of processing will change in the near future.
Columbia River Sugar Company, a grower owned
sugarbeet production cooperative based in the Moses
Lake area, announced that it has completed
negotiations with Holly Sugar Corporation, to
construct and operate a sugarbeet factory in the
Moses Lake area. The factory's initial slicing
capacity when it commences operations in 1998 will be
6,000 tons per day, and its design provides for
incremental expansion should market conditions
warrant. This will represent the first new beet
processing plant to be built in the United States
since 1975. 
 
Great Plains--Sugarbeet production results in the
Great Plains are mixed. Regional sugarbeet area
harvested, including the States of Colorado, Montana,
Nebraska, Texas, and Wyoming, totals 250,600 acres,
down 2.6 percent from last year. Yields are expected
to be somewhat below normal for the region, averaging
19.5 tons per acre. Total sugarbeet tonnage is
estimated by USDA at 4.88 million tons, 17 percent of
the national total, and 9 percent below last year.
The beet slicing campaign began in late September at
the region's 11 processing facilities: Colorado, 2;
Nebraska, 3; Wyoming, 3; Montana, 2; and Texas, 1.
 
In Montana the growing season was marred by a cold,
wet spring which delayed the emergence of the
sugarbeet crop. Hail storms plagued the area during
the summer months and freezing temperatures in late
September kept sugar content from reaching the record
levels of recent years, and yields were 15 percent
below the most recent 5-year average. Total tonnage
for the State is estimated at 1.22 million tons, 6.6
percent below last year. 

The sugarbeet crops in northern and central Wyoming
were subject to similar spring conditions, but the
summer growing season was nearly ideal. However, in
southeast Wyoming poor spring planting conditions,
coupled with adverse weather through the growing
season adversely affected the sugarbeet crop, and
harvesting results were poor. State-wide sugarbeet
production for Wyoming is estimated at 1.30 million
tons, up 18 percent from last year. 

This season proved to be particularly difficult
agronomically in Nebraska and Colorado, with
year-to-year yields falling 19 percent to 16.5 tons
per acre in Nebraska and 17.7 tons in Colorado. In
both States a cold wet spring accented disease
problems with higher incidence of seedling stress,
fusarium, and rhizoctionia. At harvest both areas
were hard hit by frost in late September, especially
to the growing area in western Nebraska. With the
short crop, processing campaigns will wind up during
the first 2 weeks of January in both States. 
 
In the southern part of the Great Plains, very little
moisture was received in the growing area around
Hereford, Texas during the summer months. Yields were
slightly below normal and due to a fall-off in
acreage--19,500 acres this season versus a high of
41,000 in 1990--total sugarbeet production is
expected to be only 429,000 tons compared with nearby
500,000 tons last year and an average of 837,000 tons
for 1990-93.
 
California--Sugarbeet agriculture in California
spreads from the Imperial Valley on the border with
Mexico through the Central Valley and to the Klamath
Basin straddling the Oregon line. Sugarbeet acreage
harvested continues to decline in California and is
estimated at 114,000 this season, compared with
annual averages of 151,000 for the first 5 years of
the 1990's and 201,000 acres during the 1980's. The
downturn this year is explained by heavy rains last
spring which delayed plantings and caused some plant
loss, especially in the Sacramento Valley, and the
availability to growers of more remunerative
alternative crops.
 
The decline in area will be offset somewhat by yields
that are the highest in the nation at 27 tons per
acre. Total harvested tonnage from California grown
beets is estimated by USDA at 3.1 million tons, down
25 percent from 1994. Sugarbeets in California are
processed at six plants, one located in the Imperial
Valley and five others located in the Central Valley.
These plants also process sugarbeets from the Klamath
Basin in Oregon, Central Oregon, and Washington.
 
In the Imperial Valley, the beet crop got off to a
good start as soil temperature remained above average
until early spring. The 1995 April-July harvest was a
record, yielding over 5.5 tons of sugar per acre
compared with a national average of 3.0 tons per
acre. In the Central Valley, the fall tonnage and
sucrose content were slightly below average. Next
spring's crop will be short due to rain delays that
prevented planting. In addition, the State has
experienced its driest fall on record along with
unseasonably warm temperatures, and these
developments could affect yields.
 
Consumption
Sugar Use Growth Slows
The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchanged
at 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tons
or about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand is forecast
to run only slightly ahead of the 0.8 percent annual
population growth, compared with the 1.6 percent
growth rate of recent years. The lower rate of growth
is attributed to encroachment of high fructose corn
syrup into traditional sugar markets and weak demand
for confectionery and bakery products--major
industrial users of sugar. Following the major
contraction in sugar use in the early 1980's due to
the substitution of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)
for sugar in soft drinks, sugar use has expanded an
average of 164,000 tons per year over the last decade
(fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), (figure 11). 
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995 sugar
consumption is estimated at 9.34 million tons, about
the same as use in 1993/94. Industrial users' switch
from traditional stocking patterns to just-in-time
delivery systems, which may be causing a one-time
reduction in apparent sugar deliveries. Crystalline
fructose use, while small, also may be taking some
sugar markets. Reduced transfers to sugar-containing
products for export also was a factor in 1994/95.
 
Sugar deliveries for confectionery and cereal/bakery
products in 1994/95 totaled 1.88 and 1.34 million
tons, refined value, respectively. Together these two
categories accounted for 64 percent of industrial use
and were down slightly from the year before. Growth
in sugar use by the bakery/cereal and confectionery
sectors had underpinned the growth in total sugar use
in recent years. The decline in growth in these two
key use categories is attributed to sluggish demand
for cookies, sweet goods, and confectionery,
including lower confectionery exports (figure 12).
 
Trade
Sugar Import Quota Raised
Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,
the Secretary of Agriculture on November 9, increased
the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for
raw-cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000 metric
tons) after the release of the monthly WASDE report.
This action raised the TRQ to 1.56 million short
tons, and raised total supply (carrying stocks,
production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,
comparable with the 11.1 million forecast in
September as the reduction in the sugar production
forecast largely was offset by the TRQ increase.
 
According to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, TRQ
imports for the first 2 months of fiscal 1995/96
(October 1-December 1) totaled 91,116 short tons. At
the request of several countries, USDA allowed early
entry of 1995/96 TRQ sugar. These early entries,
arriving before October 1, 1995, totaled 82,960 tons.
As of December 1, 1.395 million tons of TRQ sugar
were available for entry into the United States prior
to September 30, 1996.
 
As of December 1, 1995, all but about 200 tons of the
refined sugar tariff-rate-quota for 1995/96 set at
24,251 short tons (22,000 metric tons) had been
filled. There are also specialty sugar quotas for 23
countries, each allocated 79 tons. These specialty
quotas are not usually all filled. At the present
time several countries, including Japan and United
Kingdom, are not eligible to fill their specialty
sugar import quotas, since they have failed to give
assurance that no Cuban sugar will be transhipped in
their quota.
 
Over the past decade, the United States has remained
a major importer of sugar as growth in consumption
needs has largely offset upward trending domestic
sugar production. Total U.S. sugar imports averaged
2.0 million tons annually from 1985/86-1989/90.
Imports were composed largely of TRQ imports
averaging 1.45 million tons, and 511,000 tons of
quota-exempt imports for reexport as refined sugar or
in sugar-containing products. For the period
1990/91-1994/95, U.S. sugar imports averaged 2.1
million tons of which TRQ imports accounted for 1.6
million and quota-exempt imports 548,000 tons. 

Starting October 1, 1995 the United States has a
commitment, under the Uruguay Round Agreement, to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow import access
for at least 1.256 million short tons per year at the
low tariff level of the TRQ.
 
The United States also remains a small, but
consistent exporter of sugar. These exports are
largely refined sugar produced from quota-exempt raw
sugar imported, refined, and reexported. For 1994/95
total exports were 502,000 tons of which reexports
were 445,000 tons. Despite the changes in trade with
Canada, U.S. sugar reexports in 1995/96 are expected
to drop only slightly because of favorable markets
for refined sugar in other countries, and currently a
large differential between raw and refined sugar
prices on the world market. Over the last decade,
(1985/86-1994/95), U.S. sugar exports averaged
494,000 tons annually of which reexports accounted
for over 95 percent of the annual total.
 
U.S. Canada Sugar Trade Developments
On November 6, 1995, the Canadian International Trade
Tribunal (CITT) ruled that sugar imports from the
United States, certain member States of the European
Union (EU), and Korea are being dumped in Canada.
Revenue Canada found dumping and subsidies in a final
ruling in September or October. The CITT ruled in
November that the dumped and subsidized sugar
threatened to injure the Canadian sugar industry. The
CITT also found that sugar imports from the EU are
being subsidized. The investigation was initiated in
March 1995 following a petition from the Canadian
Sugar Institute, and in July, Revenue Canada
announced a preliminary finding of dumping and
subsidizing in the case and imposed provisional
anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The CITT
ruled in November that, although the imports threaten
the livelihood of Canadian sugar refiners, no damage
had yet occurred. Any duties paid since July were
refunded, but the tariffs will apply from November 6. 

The anti-dumping duties on U.S. companies exporting
sugar range from 69 to 85 percent. The duties against
Korea were dropped due to the small volume of trade
involved. It is possible that this ruling may be
appealed by parties in the United States and/or in
Canada. The ruling effectively eliminates U.S. sugar
from the Canadian market. In 1994/95 the United
States exported 158,000 tons, raw value of refined
sugar to Canada including approximately 101,000 Tons
under the reexport program.
 
Stocks and Prices
Stocks Forecast Lower
U.S. sugar stocks at the end of fiscal 1995/96
(September 30, 1996) are forecast at 1.19 million
tons, down about 3 percent from the revised estimate
for fiscal 1994/95. Stocks reflect a projected total
supply of 11.01 million tons and total use of 9.82
million. The fiscal 1995/96 stocks-to-use ratio is
forecast at 12.1 percent, compared with 12.5 percent
for 1994/95. According to USDA's stocks and price
model, a 1-percent drop in the ending stocks-to-use
ratio has historically corresponded to a 0.3-cent a
pound rise in the New York price for domestic raw
cane sugar.
 
For the year ending September 30, 1995, stocks are
estimated at 1.23 million tons. This compares with
1.45 million tons estimated in September. The 217,000
ton decline in the stock estimate can be attributed
to downward revisions in supply variables, such as
production, and upward adjustments to use variables
such as exports. From 1985/86-1994/95, end of year
stocks and the stocks-to-use ratio averaged 1.42
million tons and 15.4 percent, respectively.
 
Sugar Prices Remain Firm
U.S. raw cane prices averaged 23.21 cents a pound in
September and 22.67 cents in October (Contract No.
14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent above the level
for the same months in 1994. Since the quota
increase, prices have remained firm averaging 22.60
cents a pound for November and 22.64 cents for the
first 11 market days of December. As indicated in the
November 9 press release announcing the quota change,
USDA will continue monitoring import requirements and
will adjust the TRQ accordingly.
 
U.S. prices of raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar
have remained relatively stable over the last decade
because of the U.S. sugar program (figures 15 and
16). Raw cane sugar prices averaged 21.96 cents a
pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a low of 20.46
cents in 1985/86 and a high of 23.29 cents in
1989/90. Wholesale refined beet sugar prices averaged
25.74 cents a pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a
low and high of 23.30 in 1985/86 and 30.14 cents in
1989/90, respectively. U.S. retail refined sugar
prices averaged 39.31 cents annually over the 10 year
period, ranging from a low of 35.12 cents in 1986/87
to a high of 43.08 cents in 1990/91. The spreads
between the low and high years for raw cane sugar
were 2.45 cents a pound, for wholesale refined beet
sugar 6.85 cents, and for retail refined sugar 7.96
cents.
 
Costs
New USDA Estimates on Processing Costs
In the winter and spring of 1994-95, ERS contacted
all beet and cane sugar processors to collect
processing cost information for the 1992 crops. Based
on these data, processing costs for the 1993 and 1994
crops have been estimated and previously published
processing costs for 1992 have been revised. For
beets, the traditional East (Red River Valley and
eastward) and West (all other) processing regions
have been maintained. For cane, however, Louisiana
and Texas have been combined to prevent disclosure of
confidential accounting data for the one factory in
Texas.
 
In fiscal 1993/94, a record 4.55 million tons of raw
beet sugar were produced, an 11-percent increase over
1993. Costs of processing this sugar rose 3.6
percent, averaging $35.06 per net ton sliced.
However, after accounting for credits for byproducts,
net processing costs averaged $26.50, a 2.7-percent
drop from 1993. This difference is explained by
increased returns from pulp and molasses offsetting
higher, primarily fixed, processing costs. Similar
relationships were found on a cents-per-pound basis.
Total processing costs rose in 1994 but were offset
by higher credits, even with a slight drop in sugar
recovery.
 
Over the 1992-94 period, total costs per ton of beets
sliced were consistently higher in the East than in
the West. However, this can be offset by the higher
sugar recovery rates in the East. On a
cents-per-pound basis, total beet sugar processing
costs were lower in the East. In 1994, recovery rates
narrowed and, while recovery was still higher in the
East, processing costs per pound of sugar were lower
in the West. 

Raw cane sugar production for fiscal 1993/94 was up
nearly 2 percent. U.S. total processing costs for the
1994 sugarcane crop averaged $19.22 per ton, up 2.3
percent from 1993. Most of the increase was due to
increases in the costs of materials and supplies for
cane transportation and factory repairs and
maintenance. On a cents-per-pound basis, costs rose
even more (5.1 percent) due to a 2.7-percent drop in
the average sugar recovery rate. 

There was considerable cost variation across the
major sugarcane regions. Florida is the major
producer and had costs of 6.98 cents per pound,
compared with Louisiana/Texas costs of 8.26 cents and
Hawaii costs of 11.345 cents. On a percentage basis,
Louisiana/Texas had the largest increase for the year
due to a nearly 9 percent drop in recovery rate.

After subtracting credits for molasses and other
byproducts, net processing costs ranged from 6.30
cents in Florida to 9.3 cents in Hawaii, averaging
7.22 cents at the U.S. level.
 
Adjustment to Production Costs
USDA has revised its sugarcane costs and returns
estimates published in the Sugar and Sweetener report
in September to account for yields on a net ton per
harvested acre basis rather than a gross ton basis.
This change will bring the estimates into conformity
with yield estimates published by USDA's National
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in Crop
Production reports. 

The change has two effects:
* Gross value of production (price times yield) was
revised to reflect the change in yield. This also
affects the returns estimates which are the
difference in gross value of production and either
total cash expenses or total economic costs.
 
* Costs for land were reduced in the Louisiana-Texas
region. This is due to a change in the share rent
cost which is based on the imputed gross value of
production. Per acre cash costs were not affected.
 
The estimates for 1994 still remain preliminary in
that regional sugarcane prices will not be published
by USDA until January, 1996. When 1994 prices are
published, estimates will be revised to reflect the
new estimates. Until then, 1994 prices have been kept
at their 1993 levels.
 
USDA's latest costs of sugar crop production and
processing estimates, as well as sugar crop loan
rates, are provided in tables 31-39. 

U.S. Sugar Import Duties 1/
by Ron Lord*
 
1/ The words duty and tariff are used
interchangeably.

U.S. import duties on sugar agreed to during the
Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) generally became
effective on January 1, 1995. 
 
October 1, 1995, the United States has agreed to set
an access level for sugar imported under the low duty
and the time period of the import quotas is fixed as
of October 1 through the following September 30. The
minimum low-duty tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for raw cane
sugar is 1.231 million short tons, and for refined
sugar, 24,251 short tons, raw value. With either the
raw or refined sugar quotas, the Secretary of
Agriculture may reserve a TRQ quantity for the
importation of specialty sugars as defined by the
United States Trade Representative. The Secretary of
Agriculture has authority to set a TRQ higher (but
not lower) than the above minimum levels. For
example, on November 9, 1995, the Secretary announced
an increase in the raw cane sugar import TRQ for
1995/96 of 331,000 tons above the minimum level.
 
The low duty for raw cane sugar under quota, as
determined under Additional U.S. Note 5 of Chapter 17
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS), is 0.625 cents a pound, raw value.
This duty is waived for countries under the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the ANDEAN
trade pact. Thus the low duty on TRQ imports is
waived for all countries currently allocated a share
of the U.S. sugar import quota except Australia,
Brazil, Gabon, and Taiwan. There is a polarization
adjustment (i.e. an adjustment of the duty for
quality differences) on the low duty. For the
purposes of subheadings 1701.11 and 1701.12, "raw
sugar" means sugar whose content of sucrose by
weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a
polarimeter reading of less than 99.5 degrees.
 
The low duty for refined sugar under the quota is
1.66 cents a pound for 100-degree sugar. There is a
polarization adjustment for refined sugar testing
less than 100 degrees.
 
Any amounts of sugar imported in excess of the
announced TRQ levels pay the high duty. The high duty
is based upon a tariff equivalent to the quotas in
place during the period 1986-88, and is scheduled to
decline by 15 percent over 6 years to the year 2000.
For raw cane sugar, the base period duty was
established at 18.08 cents a pound, and the first 2
-percent reduction which took effect January 1, 1995,
resulted in a duty of 17.62 cents a pound for 1995.
The duty will fall to 15.36 cents a pound in the year
2000. The high duty on refined sugar is about 1 cent
higher, and will fall to 16.21 cents a pound in the
year 2000. There is no polarization adjustment for
the duties on sugar imported above the TRQs, but the
United States is considering a technical revision of
the HTSUS to provide for such polarization
adjustments. 

U.S. duties on sugar imports from Mexico are covered
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
which became effective January 1, 1994. The duty on
Mexican sugar imported under the access provisions of
NAFTA is zero, and the duty for sugar above the
access provisions is 15.20 cents a pound in 1995.
This NAFTA high duty will decline to zero by the year
2008. 

Sugar imports from Canada are composed entirely of
refined beet sugar, since Canada's export control
regime only allows domesically produced sugar to be
exported. Sugar imported from Canada under the
provisions of HTSUS Additional Note 5 faces a duty of
0.20 cents a pound in 1995, and this will fall to
zero in 1998 as agreed to in the U.S.-Canada Free
Trade Agreement which became effective in 1989. The
available TRQ for refined sugar for 1995/96 is 22,426
tons, which is the announced total TRQ for refined
sugar of 24,251 tons minus 1,825 tons set aside for
specialty sugar allocations for 23 countries. In
fiscal 1996, this refined sugar TRQ is available on a
first-come, first-served basis.
 
Duties on HFCS between the United States and Canada
are low and scheduled to decline to zero in 1998. The
Mexican duty on HFCS from the United States is
scheduled to decline from a base of 15 percent (prior
to the implementation of NAFTA in 1994) to zero over
10 years, and in 1995 is 12 percent. Between October
1, 1990 and January 1, 1995 sugar imports from Canada
were not subject to quota. 
 
World and U.S. Corn Sweeteners
World Production
World Production Growing But
Remains Highly Concentrated
The world's leading non-sucrose caloric sweetener is
high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS is a liquid
sweetener which can be produced from a variety of
feedstocks provided they contain sufficient amounts
of starch. The most prominent source of starch in the
United States is corn, but some producers in Asia use
sweet potatoes or tapioca. In Europe, wheat and
potatoes are also used as starch feedstocks.
 
Globally, HFCS first started to make an economic
impact in the mid-1970's when sugar prices soared and
new technologies became available. The global sugar
price boom of the mid-1970's provided a much needed
protective umbrella for the first attempts to produce
HFCS on an industrial scale. Global sugar prices
boomed again in the early 1980's, at about the same
time that further major technological breakthroughs
occurred and proved that this alternative caloric
sweetener was commercially attractive even when lower
sugar prices prevailed.
 
While sugar prices have historically been the leading
reference value for determining the market
penetration of HFCS, sugar and HFCS are not perfect
substitutes. For example, sugar has a number of
bulking, texture, and browning characteristics which
make it the sweetener of choice for the
confectionery, bakery, and cereal industries.
World-wide, HFCS is competing primarily with liquid
sugar in carbonated soft drinks. The availability of
HFCS in liquid form creates constraints for storage
and trade. Transport of HFCS is costly and therefore
trade has been restricted to short-distance
exchanges.
 
According to leading international sweetener
analysts, some combination of five prerequisites are
usually necessary for successful development of an
HFCS industry.
* Import status for sugar and a high internal price
for sugar o Sufficient supplies of starch at a
reasonable net price o Well developed food production
and consumption infrastructure o Capital for
investment in research and development (R&D) and
plant and equipment
* Favorable government policy
 
A decade ago world HFCS production was estimated at
5.4 million metric tons, dry basis. By 1987,
production had expanded to 6.8 million tons, and for
1995 the forecast is 9.4 million tons, up 22 percent
since 1990. Globally, production remains
concentrated, with the United States accounting for
75 percent (7.1 million metric tons) of the world
total in 1995, Japan 8 percent (750,000 tons), and
the EU 3 percent (303,000 tons), followed by Canada,
Korea, Argentina and Taiwan at between 2 and 3
percent each. Together these seven countries are
expected to account for 96 percent of global HFCS
production this year.
 
While this year-to-year growth in global HFCS
production has been significant, its production and
use remains small compared with sugar. For example,
USDA's global sugar consumption forecast for 1995/96
is 117 million metric tons versus 9.4 million for
HFCS. Moreover, the outlook for the short run is that
the substitution of HFCS for sugar will remain
confined to a small set of countries and largely to
liquid sweetener markets. 

U.S. Production
U.S. Corn Crop Lower;
Corn Sweetener Output Continues To Grow
 
The 1995/96 (September/August) U.S. corn crop is
estimated at 7.37 billion bushels, down 27 percent
from the record high 1994 corn crop, due to reduced
area and lower yields. According to USDA's November
Crop Production report, 1995/96 corn harvested
acreage is estimated at 64.8 million, down 11 percent
from last year. The reduction reflects prolonged wet
conditions in the Midwest this spring which prevented
some plantings and delayed others. Based on
conditions as of November 1, the average corn yield
is forecast at 113.7 bushels per acre compared with a
record 138.6 bushels in 1994/95. The sharp decline is
due to a very hot dry summer in many leading
production States as well as production losses this
fall. For example, yield estimates were reduced in
Kansas due to damage from early frost. In Nebraska
and some other areas, high winds led to reports of
lodging and ear droppage. With generally favorable
conditions, farmers made rapid progress harvesting
corn in October. As of November 5, 87 percent of the
crop was harvested in the 17 major producing States
accounting for 94 percent of estimated production.
This compares with an average of 74 percent.
 
This year is shaping up as one of the tightest ever
for U.S. corn. With importers' buying continuing at a
breakneck pace, limited corn supplies and higher
prices are expected to have a larger impact on
domestic users despite strong potential demand.
 
According to the December World Agriculture Supply -
Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, domestic corn use
for 1995/96 is forecast at 6.28 billion bushels, with
feed and residual use taking 73 percent or 4.58
billion bushels, and food, seed, and industrial (FSI)
use the remainder, 1.70 billion bushels. Within the
FSI use sector, the corn grind for corn sweeteners is
forecast at a record 705 million bushels, 19.7
million short tons, up 1.7 percent from 1994/95. Corn
sweeteners represent about 9.6 percent of the
forecast domestic use of the 1995/96 crop, and 41
percent of FSI use. Over the last decade, corn use
for sweeteners have climbed from around 500 million
bushels annually to a record of over 700 million
expected this year. 

U.S. corn sweetener production in fiscal 1995/96
(October/September) is forecast to total 12.1 million
tons, dry basis, up 3.9 percent from the year that
ended September 30. This forecast reflects expanded
industry capacity and is based on recent growth
trends. Figure 19 provides a detailed flow-chart of
the corn wet-milling process yielding corn
sweeteners. 

HFCS production is forecast at 8.1 million tons, dry
basis, up 4.2 percent from 1994/95 and accounting or
about two-thirds of expected total corn sweetener
production for the coming year. For fiscal 1994/95,
HFCS production totaled 7.8 million tons, up 4.4
percent from the corresponding period in 1993/94.
 
Glucose syrup and dextrose are the other primary corn
sweeteners produced by the U.S. corn wet milling
industry. Combined glucose and dextrose production
for fiscal 1995/96 is forecast at 4.0 million tons.
This is up 125,000 tons from the fiscal 1994/95
estimate and accounts for about a third of total
expected corn sweetener production during fiscal
1995/96.
 
U.S. Consumption
HFCS Use Higher
Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach
11.2 million tons of which U.S. production is
expected to supply 98 percent. The United States
supplements domestically produced corn sweetener
supplies with imports, mainly from Canada. USDA
forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons, up
3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecast
for HFCS is based on projections of deliveries from
domestic production and imports. On a per capita
basis, and using a U.S. population of 269.2 million
(including Puerto Rico), domestic HFCS use is
forecast at 59.3 pounds in fiscal 1995/96, up from
57.7 pounds for last year, and 45.2 pounds a decade
ago. Glucose syrup and dextrose deliveries are
forecast at 3.3 million tons, up 2.6 percent from
1994/95.
 
HFCS deliveries for fiscal 1994/95 totaled 7.68
million tons, up 3.5 percent from the preceding year.
HFCS-55 use is driven largely by demand by the
nonalcoholic beverage sector which normally accounts
for 90 percent of its total use. Tables 44 and 45
provide a breakout of HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 use by
major food use categories and beverages. For HFCS-55,
there appears to be only small growth in food
categories such as processed foods; with beverages
remaining the leading category of use. HFCS-42
depends on beverages for only about 40 to 45 percent
of its total use. Other food use categories in total
are more important and expanding, especially use in
processed foods, and the cereal and bakery category.
For 1995, soft drink use growth is estimated at 3 to
4 percent, somewhat below increases in recent years.
While summer soft drink use was reported to be
strong, price increases--mainly due to increased
costs for plastic and aluminum packaging--earlier in
the year dampened demand somewhat.

U.S. Prices and Costs
HFCS Prices Remain Low Through Summer
HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and
16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis respectively,
for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For the
June through September period, prices for HFCS-55
averaged 18.51 cents a pound and for HFCS-42, prices
averaged 16.62 cents. Normally, prices move up
sharply during the summer due to the high demand for
HFCS from the beverage sector and because of tight
processing capacity. However, this past summer, while
demand was strong due to unusually hot summer
temperatures in many parts of the country, prices did
not move up. This reflects added corn sweetener
processing capacity, as much as 25 percent according
to some estimates, that came on line in the last
year. With the very sharp downturn in this season's
corn crop, HFCS prices have increased.
 
HFCS prices are consistently lower than refined sugar
in the U.S. market. For the 10 year period
1985/86-1994/95, wholesale HFCS prices averaged 20.76
cents a pound, dry basis, compared with 25.74 cents
for refined beet sugar. This price spread of nearly 5
cents is one major reason for the substitution of
HFCS for sugar in beverage and certain food markets.
Moreover, these HFCS prices are "list prices" and
likely do not reflect significant price discounts
received by major buyers.
 
Fundamental also to the growth of the corn sweetener
industry in the United States has been the abundant
availability of corn coupled with its relatively low
cost. The cost of corn as a raw material input can be
viewed either on a gross or net basis. The
wet-milling process creates three valuable
byproducts: corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal, and
corn oil. Sale of these byproducts generates revenues
that reduce the gross cost of corn. When corn prices
rise, so usually do the byproduct prices, partly
offsetting the effect of higher corn prices on corn
sweeteners. In the calculation of byproduct credits,
it is assumed 1 bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds and
produces 1.55 pounds of crude corn oil, 13.5 pounds
of corn gluten feed, 2.65 pounds of corn gluten meal,
and 33.33 pounds of corn sweetener, dry weight. Table
51 provides net cost of corn starch data through
November 1995. 

The Midwest price of number 2 yellow dent corn, the
grade used by wet millers, averaged $2.28 per bushel
for the first 9 months of fiscal 1994/95, compared
with $2.67 for the corresponding period in 1993/94.
The lower corn prices in 1994/95 reflected the record
corn crop. But corn prices have been rising in recent
months averaging $2.77 per bushel July-September,
$3.12 in October and $3.22 in November, reflecting
the forecast sharp downturn in corn production in
1995/96. The December WASDE forecast corn prices for
1995/96 to range from $2.95-3.35 a bushel, compared
with $2.26 per bushel for the whole season of
1994/95.
 
Net corn cost averaged $1.67 per bushel in October
1995 versus 1.27 per bushel for the first 9 months of
1995. For the previous decade (1985-1994), net corn
costs averaged 90 cents a bushel.
 
U.S. Honey and Maple Syrup
Production
Honey Output Unchanged
U.S. honey production in 1995 is estimated at 216
million pounds (108,000 short tons), practically
unchanged from 1994. Production of honey in the
United States have been hampered by a continued
decline on bee colonies. The number of commercial bee
colonies in the United States has gradually declined
from a peak of 5.9 million in the late 1940's, to 4.3
million in 1985, and to an estimated 2.7 million in
1995. Declining colony numbers are mainly due to
fewer easily accessible floral sources, increased use
of pesticides, increasing losses from mites, rising
production costs, and declining net income.
 
In addition, the migration of Africanized bees into
the southern United States may have contributed to a
decline in beekeeping, and therefore, reduced bee
colonies. Although the number of producing colonies
has declined over the past years, honey yields per
colony have increased. Yields per colony averaged 35
pounds in 1985, 62 pounds in 1990, and compared with
an estimated 78 pounds in 1994. The lower colony
numbers and higher yields likely reflect structural
adjustments in the U.S. honey industry in which
smaller producers continue to leave the industry,
while larger apiaries continue technological
improvements. More than one-third of all colonies in
the United States are located in California, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Florida. These
States continue to account for over half of U.S.
honey production.
 
Maple Syrup Lower
Maple syrup production for 1995 is estimated at 1.1
million gallons, down 17 percent from 1994. The
downturn is largely attributed to a fall-off in
production in Vermont, the largest producing State,
from 435,000 gallons in 1994 to 365,000 gallons this
year, due to less than optimal weather. To generate
the best sap flows, freezing conditions at night
followed by warm days are required. Production was up
somewhat in Maine, the second largest producer but
down in New York, the third largest producer. In New
York, the first sap run was reported March 4 and the
last April 1, with an average of 47 gallons of sap
per gallon of syrup. In 1994, the first and last run
were March 16 and April 11, respectively, average
yields were 41 gallons of sap per gallon of syrup.
 
Consumption
Honey Use Expected Lower
U.S. honey consumption has been increasing in the
last few years, due to population growth and
increased use by bakery, cereal, and health food
manufacturers. However, U.S. domestic demand for
honey in 1995 is forecast to decrease by 4 percent
based on lower supplies and higher prices. Household
consumption accounts for approximately 40 percent of
total U.S. honey domestic use. Honey for table use is
generally liquid, light color, and with mild flavor.
The United States is also one of the world's largest
markets for industrial honey, which accounts for
about 45 percent of total domestic consumption. The
food manufacturing industry, primarily bakery, health
food, and cereal manufactures, is the major user of
industrial honey. The food service industry, which is
comprised of restaurants, schools, hospitals, and
other institutional operations, accounts for the
remaining 15 percent of the honey consumed annually
in the United States. 

Maple Syrup Demand Trading Up
Maple syrup use continues to grow in popularity.
Total use was estimated at 4.0 million gallons in
1994, compared with 2.5 million in 1985. The upturn
in use can be attributed to wider marketing of
domestic output increasingly supplemented by imports. 
 
Trade
U.S. Net Honey Importer
Exports of U.S. honey in 1994 were 8.3 million pounds
or 4,171 short tons, 2 percent below 1993 shipments,
mainly due to increased competition from low priced
Chinese and Argentine honey in international markets.
U.S. honey exports in 1995 are forecast at 9.3
million pounds or about 12 percent above 1994
shipments. Although U.S. honey supplies are expected
to be lower in 1995, higher international prices,
combined with continued promotion campaigns in
principal U.S. markets, like those in the Middle
East, have improved U.S. honey export prospects this
year. Total U.S. honey shipments during the period
January-August, 1995, reached 5.7 million pounds, up
25 percent from exports during the same period last
year. Moreover, exports to date to important markets
such as Germany, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia are also
running ahead of last year.
 
About 55-60 percent of U.S. honey is exported in bulk
form, with the remaining 40-45 percent directed to
the retail consumer-ready market. Exports of
high-quality, consumer-packed honey have been
increasing in recent years due to increased world
demand and to promotional efforts under the Market
Promotion Program, which is administered by the
National Honey Board. 

U.S. imports of honey in 1994 were 123.2 million
pounds or 61,615 tons, 8 percent less than imports in
1993. Anti-dumping investigations regarding honey
imports from China, the major supplier to the U.S.
market, discouraged exports of Chinese honey to the
United States last year. Still, U.S. honey imports
from Argentina in 1994 increased for the sixth
consecutive year to 40.3 million pounds. 
 
U.S. imports in 1995 are forecast to decrease further
to 84.0 million pounds based on a new agreement
reached this year with China, which will restrict the
amount of Chinese honey imported into the United
States. Moreover, decreased world honey supplies and
higher international prices will likely discourage
U.S. honey imports in 1995. U.S. honey exports during
the period January-August 1995, were 58.6 million
pounds, compared with 85.8 pounds during the same
period last year. Moreover, imports from China and
Argentina, the two top U.S. suppliers, are running
behind last year's pace by 64 and 33 percent,
respectively. China, Argentina, Canada, and Mexico
have been the leading suppliers of honey to the
United States, accounting for nearly 90 percent of
U.S. honey imports. Honey imports account for about
30 to 35 percent of U.S. honey consumption. Over the
past decade (1985-94), U.S. honey imports have
exceeded exports by about 90 million pounds annually. 

Maple Syrup Exports Small,
Imports Growing
U.S. maple syrup exports continue to be small,
totaling only 569,000 gallons in 1994, and averaging
364,000 annually for the previous 5 years. In
contrast, imports of maple syrup, mainly from Canada,
were a record 3.3 million gallons in 1994 with annual
imports averaging 51.5 million gallons for the
previous 5 year average. The upturn in imports
reflects increasing demand for maple syrup in the
United States and the need to supplement domestic
supplies.
 
Programs and Policies
Honey Support Program Changed
The U.S. Honey Price Support Program was amended by
the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1993. The 1993
Act reduced the minimum honey loan rate from 53.8
cents a pound for the 1991-95 crops, to 50 cents a
pound for the 1994 and 1995 crops, 49 cents a pound
for the 1996 crop, 48 cents for the 1997 crop, and 47
cents a pound for the 1998 crop. The 1993 Act also
dropped the 1 percent (0.538 cent) nonrefundable
marketing assessment, which growers paid on each
pound of domestically produced honey. However, the
funding for the price support portion of the honey
program was eliminated for the 1994 and 1995 honey
crops. Also, the loan portion of the program is now
operating as a recourse, interest-charged loan
program. Loans are available for 9 months to provide
interim financing while a producer markets the honey.
Table 62 provides data on loan activity.
 
Chinese Imports Restricted
U.S. honey imports from China expanded steadily from
about 26.5 million pounds in 1989 to 75 million in
1993. In response to a petition from the American
Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey
Producers Association, the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) instituted an anti-dumping
investigation on imports of honey from China in
October 1994. On November 14, 1994, ITC voted
unanimously to pursue a complaint that Chinese honey
was being dumped in the United States and harming
U.S. honey producers. After the ITC decides to accept
a case, the actual anti-dumping investigation is done
by the International Trade Administration, Department
of Commerce. After ITC found that honey from China
had been dumped in the United States, anti-dumping
duties on imports from China were established. 

In August 1995, the U.S. Department of Commerce and
the Government of China reached an agreement, which
suspends punitive U.S. anti-dumping duties and places
quantitative and a price limits on Chinese honey or
shipments to the United States. The agreement, which
covers 5 years beginning in 1995, will allow China to
export 44 million pounds (21,982 short tons 19,942
metric tons) of honey annually to the United States.
The agreement also established that Chinese honey
cannot be sold at a price lower than a reference
price, equivalent to 92 percent of the average unit
value of honey imported by the United States from all
other countries. The reference price will be updated
quarterly. Tables 58-64 provide supply use and price
statistics for honey and maple syrup.
 
World and U.S. High Intensity Sweeteners
World High Intensity Sweetener Use Continues To
Expand
World production and use of high intensity (low
calorie) sweeteners continues to expand around the
globe. While USDA does not have an independent
production survey system for high intensity
sweeteners, a prominent market analyst places
combined production of saccharin, aspartame, and
acesulfame-k at about 37 million pounds (table 65).
No public data are available for the other major high
intensity sweeteners cyclamate, sucralose, and
alitame. The approximate sugar sweetener equivalent
(SSE) to the major high intensity sweeteners is as
follows: cyclamate (30), aspartame (180),
acesulfame-k (200), saccharin (300), sucralose (600),
and alitame (2,000). 

The growth in the use of high intensity sweeteners
reflects their cost economics compared with sugar and
HFCS. One of the most notable features of the world
intense sweetener sector in recent years has been the
growing trend towards the blending of different
sweeteners with one another. From a commercial point
of view, one of the most important advantages of such
blends is their sweetening synergies. The sweetness
intensity delivered by a blend is nearly always far
greater than the sum of the sweetness potencies of
the individual sweeteners, enabling food and drink
manufacturers to realize substantial sweetener cost
savings. Moreover, blending often results in taste
synergies and enhanced stability.
 
For markets to grow, these products must first gain
approval by food safety authorities in various
countries. For example, both sucrolose and alitame
were approved for use in Mexico and Australia this
past year. In contrast, both products are awaiting
approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for use in the United States.
 
Saccharin is one of the most widely used high
intensity sweeteners. It is approved for use in the
EU, Japan, China, Canada (for table top use and
pending approval in soft drinks and food), and the
United States. Saccharin has been low priced
averaging about 1 cent a pound SSE, in the United
States. It is widely used in China and Indonesia as a
substitute for sugar in soft drinks and other foods.
In the United States and Europe, saccharin is also
widely used in non-food uses such as toothpaste and
pharmaceuticals. 

One of the oldest and most widely used blends is that
of saccharin with cyclamate. Used on their own, the
taste profiles of these sweeteners are poor, both
having slight metallic after tastes. However, when
used together, the overall taste profile is much
improved. Moreover, because of sweetening synergies
that exist between the two sweeteners and low costs,
the potential cost savings are significant. However,
in some of the world's largest sweetener markets
regulatory barriers prohibit the use of one or either
of these sweeteners. For example, in the United
States and United Kingdom cyclamate have been banned
for use since 1969.
 
Aspartame has achieved wide-approval in the EU,
Canada, Japan, and the United States. Applications in
the United States include carbonated soft drinks,
refrigerated and non-refrigerated ready-to-drink
beverages, table top use, frozen desserts, yogurt,
and candies. Aspartame gradually loses its sweetness
in liquids as a function of time, temperature, and
pH. It also loses its sweetness when exposed to high
heat, as in baking. A new encapsulated form of
aspartame was recently approved by FDA for baking.
Encapsulation protects aspartame under high heat and
releases the sweetener only during the final stage of
baking.
 
Aspartame's advances in the U.S. market were spurred
largely by growth in demand for "diet" soft drinks,
despite its high cost--in 1989 $60-$70 per pound, or
36 cents a pound SSE. Since NutraSweet's patent on
aspartame expired in December 1992, the price has
fallen and currently is estimated at about $20-$35
dollars a pound, or 17 cents a pound SSE. While most
of the aspartame used in the United States is
produced domestically, dependence on imports is
growing. In 1994, the United States imported a record
5.9 million pounds (2,683 tons) valued at $92.4
million, most of it from Japan. The unit import value
was $15.62 per pound, or 8.68 cent a pound SSE (table
66). 

Acesulfame-k has broad approval for use in food and
beverages in the EU and Canada. It has not been
approved yet in Japan. In the United States it has
been approved for a number of food products such as
baked goods, yogurt, dry drink mixes, and as a table
top sweetener. Approval is pending for its use in
carbonated soft drinks. In the United States, its
price on a sugar equivalent basis is about 17 cents a
pound. In Europe an increasingly popular blend is
acesulfame-k and aspartame.
 
Competition in U.S. Soft Drink Market Between High
Intensity Sweeteners, Sugar, and HFCS
 
During the 1980s, U.S. sweetener analysts generally
believed that aspartame was not having much negative
impact upon the market for caloric sweeteners such as
sugar and HFCS. Instead, aspartame was competing with
saccharin. It was also felt that aspartame had played
a major role in revitalizing the diet beverage
market, but that these extra sales represented a new
form of soft drink demand, which was largely in
addition to the existing large non-diet or regular
soft drink sales. More recently, this view has been
changed. Analysts now believe that there is some
"cannibalisation" or substitution of the regular soft
drink market by diet products--that is, high
intensity sweeteners are competing directly with the
caloric sweeteners, sugar, and HFCS.
 
Ukraine's Sugar Industry: Recent Developments and
Prospects by Peter Buzzanell, Yuri Markish, and Roger
Hoskin

Note: This is the second in a series of three
articles on the republics of the former Soviet Union
that will appear in the Sugar and Sweetener Situation
and Outlook report. The first article, "The Russian
Federation: Sugar Industry in Transition" appeared in
March 1994. 

Abstract: Four years after the end of the Soviet
period, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest
sugar producers despite declines in area, yield, and
production. The processing industry is plagued with
outmoded equipment and production practices which
hamper productivity. To date, government
privatization efforts have meant no real change in
administration. High prices and falling incomes have
lowered Ukrainian sugar consumption. The country
remains self-sufficient in sugar and exports about
half of its production, mostly to other FSU
countries. Current tariff regimens, especially in
Russia, could favor the resurgence of raw sugar
imports for refining and reexport. 
 
Introduction
Ukraine's sugarbeet industry ranks as one of the
world's largest in terms of area harvested,
processing capacity, beet sugar production, and
trade. However, field and factory performance
continues to be constrained by high prices and
shortages of agricultural inputs, fuel, machinery,
spare parts, and low capital investment. The industry
is struggling with policy reforms as it adapts to the
country's shift from state planning to market forces.
The outlook for Ukraine's sugar industry, a key
component of the nation's rural economy and export
earnings, is being shaped by the lack of initiatives
to increase production efficiencies and the slow
reform of the industry's organizational structure.
 
Structure of Production and Processing--
Sugarbeets is a Leading Crop
Ukraine is the world's fourth largest producer of
sugarbeets and beet sugar behind France, the United
States and Germany. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts
Ukraine`s sugarbeet harvest from an estimated 1.43
million hectares, the largest of any country in the
world (table A-1). USDA forecasts Ukraine's 1995/96
sugarbeet production at 33.0 million tons yielding
4.0 million tons of beet sugar, raw value (table
A-2).
 
In recent years, sugarbeets have been processed in 19
of the Ukraine's 25 oblasts (similar to states in the
United States or provinces in Canada). Ukraine's
sugarbeet crop is sown in the spring and harvested in
the fall. Of more than 1.6 million hectares sown to
spring crops in 1995, sugarbeets accounted for about
6 percent. More than half of spring planted area was
devoted to grain crops such as barley, corn, and
fodder crops. Sunflowerseed plantings were also
somewhat larger than sugarbeets at 1.8 million
hectares. Although sugarbeets occupy less than 10
percent of cultivated land, the crop accounts for
about 30 percent of gross farm income and 15 percent
of net farm profits. Moreover, the byproducts of the
sugarbeet crop (beet tops, beet pulp, and molasses)
provide valuable animal feed to supplement fodder
crops.

Sugarbeets are grown on an estimated 7,500 to 8,000
agricultural collectives and farms spread across the
country. Key producing oblasts are located in the
central and western parts of the country, generally
near sugarbeet processing facilities (figure A-1).
Among the leading oblasts in terms of sugarbeet area
are Vinnytsya, Cherkasy, Khmel'nyts'kyy, Kiev, and
Sumy. Together these five oblasts account for over 50
percent of the total area in sugarbeets.
 
The Ukraine has excellent natural advantages for
growing sugarbeets, including fertile soil and a good
climate. Sugarbeets are grown in rotation with other
crops, particularly grains, and year-to-year changes
in beet area planted reflect the relative prices
received by farmers for sugarbeets compared with
other crops. Planted area in 1995 was 11 percent
below the average 1.66 million hectares harvested in
the late 1980's (table A-2). In part the decline
effects the disappearance of Soviet Union's central
planning schemes, under which the Ukraine was
obligated to produce sugar to meet the needs of other
republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU). The lower
acreage also reflects a shift to more profitable
grains or sunflowers, problems between sugarbeet
growers and processors, and removal of subsidies to
sugarbeet processing plants. While some traditional
sugarbeet areas have gone out of production, new
areas have come into production in the Crimea,
Dnipropetrovs'k, Luhans'k, and Kherson oblasts. Only
Zaporizhzhya oblast does not currently grow
sugarbeets.
 
In November, Ukraine's sugarbeet yields for 1995/96
were forecast at 23.2 tons per hectare, up from the
drought-reduced yields of last season but well below
the average 30.4 tons of the late 1980's. Recent
reports indicate the final result may have been
somewhat lower. Yields in the Ukraine in the late
1980's were about 5 tons below the world average of
about 35 tons (figure A-3). France and Germany
typically average yields of 42 to 45 tons per
hectare. Quantity and quality of agrochemicals and
other industrial inputs in these countries
historically have been several times higher than in
Ukraine. However, Ukrainian yields have tended to be
higher than in some neighboring East European
countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, and the Russian
Federation.
 
Ukrainian yields have declined since the end of the
Soviet period because of the declining use of
fertilizers and plant protection products. The end of
government subsidies of these inputs has led to
sharply higher prices and reduction of input use.
This season's production upturn represents a recovery
from 1994's severe drought.
 
In recent years, the productivity of Ukrainian
sugarbeet agriculture has been constrained by
problems with seeds, field equipment, chemicals, and
fuel. For example, sugarbeet seed has not been
available in sufficient quantities. Average annual
sugarbeet seed production is estimated at 17,000
tons, which is enough to plant 1.1 million hectares.
The three sugarbeet seed factories in Ukraine
(Vinnytsya, Lebedyn and Buryn) all are reportedly in
need of modernization. Foreign hybrids were planted
on about 60,000 hectares in the spring of 1995, 4
percent of total plantings.
 
Efforts to modernize the seed industry are underway.
To support breeders, each beet factory has to
contribute to a special breeding fund of the
Ukrainian Sugar Concern (Ukrsakhar), a
quasi-government agency. Five new Ukrainian-developed
hybrid seed varieties are expected to be released
soon. Domestically produced sugarbeet seeds were
given by the government to sugarbeet factories
without advance payment for the 1993-95 planting
seasons, and then distributed to farmers, also
without any advance payment. In 1995, seeds will be
reportedly paid for after the crop harvest at a cost
of 200 kilograms of sugar per hectare. Higher
yielding, foreign hybrid seed costs about three times
as much as Ukrainian varieties.
 
Fertilizer and pesticide applications have fallen
since the Soviet era due to higher prices, and
removal of subsidies to growers to purchase inputs.
Fertilizer applications to sugarbeet fields have
fallen from 300 to 450 kilograms per hectare in the
mid 1980's to 80 to100 kilograms in some areas for
the 1994/95 crop. Pesticide use has fallen to 20 to
30 percent of the amount applied during the Soviet
period. In the future, the rate of fertilizer, and
chemical use will be determined by their economic
benefit. Application rates are unlikely to return to
Soviet-period levels. Like the seed problem, the
reduced use of production-enhancing inputs has shown
up in lower sugarbeet yields.
 
Growers initially were unable to obtain credit for
the spring planting campaign in 1995. However, the
Cabinet of Ministers decided to ignore the Government
anti-inflation guidelines and requested the Ministry
of Industry to give fertilizers to sugarbeet farmers
last spring without prepayment. Final settling is
supposed to be done after growers sell their 1995
harvest, but is unlikely to happen. Given the
inflationary environment in Ukraine, the government
decision to delay payments represents a subsidy to
growers. 

Harvesting of sugarbeets normally begins in September
and lasts about 60 days, while processing can last up
to 100 days. According to Ukrainian government
sources, average losses from the previous five crops
averaged 22.5 percent. This staggering loss estimate
includes beets unharvested and those dug but not
delivered to factories. Despite the agronomic and
capital equipment problems, a return to more normal
weather helped Ukrainian farmers in 1995/96 to
harvest and deliver an estimated 33.0 million tons of
sugarbeets to processing facilities. While more than
20 percent below the 45 million ton average of the
late 1980's, the volume will exceed that of any other
country in the world. Harvests in France, Germany,
and the United States, for example, each are expected
to range around 26 million tons this season.
 
Grower-Processor Relationship
Currently Ukraine regulations presume that all
sugarbeets and byproducts (molasses and beet pulp)
are owned by the growers. Growers pay sugar factories
a processing fee ranging from 19 to 42 percent with
money, beets, or sugar. Sometimes shares of molasses
and pulp also remain with the factories. Payment is
done according to quality and quantity of beets,
taking into account data on sugar content and average
sugar losses at the factory through the entire beet
processing campaign. 
 
This season, for the first time, there appears to be
little or no state or government mandated contract
between growers and processors, and procurements
continue to be scaled back. Growers and factories
have to find their own markets for their output and
have to find supplies of inputs and equipment. The
contracts between farmers and processors are
understood to include pricing alternatives such as:
1) growers pay a fee to cover the processing and
storage costs of sugarbeets, and 2) sugar produced,
as well as molasses and pulp, remains the property of
the grower (after deducting storage losses) and the
factory retains part of the finished sugar as payment
for processing costs.
 
There are major disagreements between beet growers
and processors regarding the amount of sugar
processors should receive under barter agreements.
Processors want to implement a new regulation
stipulating that 51 percent of the sugar processed
belongs to the growers and the remainder to them. The
growers, in contrast, want a 70-30 percent split. As
a point of comparison, in the United States there is
generally a 60-40 percent grower-processor split,
with grower payments based on their individual sugar
content and the market price of sugar received by the
processor. In the western U.S. contract model, the
processor keeps returns generated from byproducts. 

Processing Facilities Need Modernization
Ukraine has one of the world's largest sugarbeet
processing industries. According to the latest
available statistics, there are 195 beet processing
plants located in 19 of the country's oblasts,
although several are not operational this season.

Total daily sugarbeet slicing capacity is about
500,000 tons, and beet sugar production capacity is
about 50,000 tons per day. In addition, Ukraine has
five raw cane sugar refineries strategically located
throughout the country, the largest of which is
situated at the Black Sea port of Odessa.

Sugarbeets are shipped to processing plants generally
located near growing areas. A large share of the
plants are clustered in the central and western part
of the country with the highest concentration in the
oblasts of Vinnytsya (41), Cherkasy (23),
Khmelnytskyy (17), and Kiev (15). By world standards
Ukraine's beet processing plants tend to be small.
For example, in the oblast of Vinnytsya, 9 of the 41
beet plants have a daily capacity under 1,500 tons;
25 have capacities of between 1,500 and 2,500 tons; 7
have capacities of between 2,500 to 5,000 tons; and
only 1 has a capacity of over 5,000 tons per day.
Only 17 plants, 9 percent of the total, have
capacities over 5,000 tons; and the national average
is 2,623 tons per day. In contrast, the U.S. beet
sugar industry's plant capacity averages 5,375 tons,
and 18 of the 34 U.S. plants have capacities over
5,000 tons per day. About 50 of Ukraine's beet
processing plants are characterized as in good
mechanical condition, 50 are in poor condition, and
the remainder are characterized as very poor. 
 
Ukraine's beet processing campaign usually starts in
mid-September and runs through mid-December. The
national average length of the processing campaign is
90 to 100 days, with some regional variation. While
portions of the industry tend to run efficiently,
large segments do not. By western standards
processing losses are high. Capacity utilization
levels during the short processing season tend to be
low due to endemic problems of insufficient beets and
lack of fuel to maintain plant operations. In recent
harvests, increasing transportation delays and lack
of coordination between growers and processors have
contributed to below-optimum throughput in factories.
High energy consumption has became a major problem
for the industry. Ukraine's exports of sugar to
Russia are tied to reciprocal arrangements for oil
imports, so the more oil required for each ton of
sugar, the more sugar that must be bartered to
Russia.
 
According to statements by Ukrsakhar, the Ukrainian
beet processing industry extracts about 72 percent of
the sugar content of sugarbeets entering the factory.
The vintage of equipment, lack of repairs and
maintenance as well as management practices in
handling beets from the field to the factory, all
contribute to lower recovery rates in Ukrainian
plants. While this extraction rate is similar to that
achieved in Soviet times in the late 1980's, it is
well below western standards. For example, in the
United States, plants normally extract over 80
percent of the sugar in beets, and if desugaring of
molasses is added, the figure goes to over 90
percent. However, the sugar content of Ukrainian
harvested sugarbeets is comparable to those of
western countries--over 16 percent. Thus, increased
efficiencies in the factories would reduce losses and
decrease costs. A good index to compare both field
and factory productivity levels is sugar produced per
hectare. As figure A-4 reveals, Ukraine's sugar per
hectare is well below levels achieved in France and
nearby Poland.
 
Yet, the sugar per hectare level in the Red River
Valley of the United States is closer to that of
Poland than France. This highlights the difference
between technical and economic efficiency. If inputs
or outputs are subsidized, then agriculture will
become very technology intensive; this may explain
the high sugar per hectare figure for France. If
product prices and inputs are not subsidized then it
may not be economically profitable to attain a higher
technical level of productivity. Ukraine's industry
is currently undergoing the removal of assets and
inputs that results when subsidies are ended, hence
the value of fixed assets is low, perhaps excessively
so. What the "optimal" use of these inputs is will
depend on costs and returns in a restructured
industry.
 
However, there is no evidence that reported changes
in ownership arrangements have meant any changes in
day-to-day administration. The Ukrainian government
scaled back procurement more out of an inability to
finance the program than out of conviction that it
should be ended. Presently, domestic sugar prices are
high, $700 to $800 a ton, well above world prices,
and stocks are ample. The fact that prices have not
fallen, suggest that growers and processors are
holding stocks because they believe that they will
eventually convince the government to ratify the
industry's high cost structure by some form of
subsidization or renationalization. 

Processing Facilities Privatization
Until 1991 all of Ukraine's processing facilities
were state owned and all the major strategic
decisions concerning plant investment and
modernization were made in Moscow and passed to Kiev
for execution. The state guaranteed a supply of
financial resources, raw material, energy, and
machinery to run the facilities. After the collapse
of the Soviet Union, central planning ceased, but the
state still owned the factories. 
 
To help solve some of the endemic problems of the
processing sector, the Ukrainian government has begun
to privatize plants and seek foreign investment to
help modernize the industry. As of the first half of
1995, 31 beet factories were reportedly privatized,
16 percent of the total. These sugar factories were
first leased, then privatized. An additional 72
factories have been leased.
 
Since early 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament has
shifted away from leasing to a direct
open-joint-stock company privatization method, with
participation of sugarbeet farmers. Regulations
require a 51-percent majority ownership by sugarbeet
farmers. However, there have been some problems with
this approach due to a lack of "farmer privatization
certificates." Moreover, there are some proposals to
renationalize factories already privatized because
the distribution of their shares does not correspond
to the recent regulations set up by the Parliament,
(i.e. farmers should hold at least 51 percent of the
shares). Ukrainian State Certificates are documents
provided by all Ukrainian state, private and
cooperative enterprises to each employee in these
organizations. Certificates are supposed to be able
to be sold for cash or traded for shares in other
enterprises. Some enterprise certificates are worth
more than others depending on the value placed on the
enterprise's assets. Some enterprises and farms are
prohibiting the use of certificates by their
employees for purchase of assets in other than the
employer's enterprise. Also the problem has arisen
that often there are not enough farmers at collective
farms with certificates to cover the required 51
percent of the factory assets. 

A major stumbling block to privatization is that the
government has set the price of these "assets" too
high and producers know it. Consequently, it is their
preference to invest their certificates in paper
assets rather than factories. Moreover, there is no
incentive to own factories that are virtually
bankrupt nor is there any incentive to buy if growers
and workers perceive that the government could be
persuaded to continue subsidization in one form or
another.
 
Foreign companies have shown little interest, to
date, in participating in joint ventures designed to
privatize beet factories. However, Ukraine is getting
some foreign investment for its raw cane sugar
refiners. Tate and Lyle Inc. of the United Kingdom,
has invested $15 million in a joint venture to
upgrade the Odessa refinery. The plan is to increase
sugar output from 750 tons per day to 1,500 tons. One
attraction of the project is that under current
regulations, Tate and Lyle can avoid the Russian
Federation's 25 percent import duty on refined sugar
by supplying refined sugar made in the Ukraine from
imported raw sugar.
 
Lack of foreign interest in Ukrainian processing
plants re-enforces the notion that the asking price
is too high given the uncertainty of the business
climate. Furthermore, given Russia's import duty
schedule for refined sugar, refining raw sugar could
be the most profitable segment of the industry,
depending on domestic sugar prices in Ukraine and
Russia, hence the foreign interest in refineries.
 
Marketing--Domestic Consumption and Exports
Per Capita Use Remains High
 
USDA forecasts 1995/96 sugar consumption in the
Ukraine at 2.25 million tons, raw value, down 50,000
tons from last year and 610,000 tons lower than the
annual average for the late 1980's and early 1990's
(1987/88-1990/91). For 1995/96, Ukraine's sugar
consumption is expected to account for 56 percent of
its production, not unlike the recent trend. Although
Ukraine is consistently a surplus producer, the
downturn in sugar use also has come at a time of
declining production.

Underlying the aggregate estimates are important
changes in per capita use. Ukraine's sugar
consumption averaged over 50 kilograms, refined, per
capita during the late 1980's, compared with 55 in
the EU and 20 worldwide during the period. The high
per capita sugar use reflected heavily subsidized
prices to consumers. Since the early 1990's sugar
consumption has fallen more than 20 percent because
of lower real income, higher prices, and increased
availability of sugar-containing product imports. 

The sources of sugar demand in Ukraine differ from
western countries. Commercial food processing and
other manufacturing account for about one-third of
total sugar use, compared with two-thirds or more in
the United States. In Ukraine, retail sales and
noncommercial home use account for about two-thirds
of total use. For example, a large share of
nonindustrial use goes for home preservation of
fruits, berries, and vegetables. In addition,
Ukrainians traditionally use sugar for homemade vodka
production. Some estimates show that about 5 percent
of the total sugar consumption goes for home
production of alcohol in Kiev, with a higher figure
in the countryside.
 
In 1991, after the demise of the Soviet structure,
the Ukrainian state sugar agency, Ukrsakhar, was
created. Ukrsakhar is responsible for sugar
distribution in domestic and export markets.
Currently, Ukrsakhar issues shipping notices to sugar
factories for sugar to be procured under state
contract.
 
Because both growers and processors are paid in
sugar, the amount remaining for disposal by the state
has been declining. Increasing shares of the sugar
crop are in the hands of farmers or processors on a
free market basis. For example, the volume of free
market sugar handled by farmers totaled nearly
300,000 tons, refined value, in 1992; 600,000 tons in
1993; and around 1.0 million tons in 1994. These
developments have created multiple domestic markets
for sugar.
 
World Ranking Exporter
Despite the downturn in export availability in recent
years, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest
beet sugar exporters, and only the European Union is
larger. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts that Ukraine will
export about 2.0 million tons, up 300,000 tons from
the previous year, but down sharply from the 4.2
million-ton-average achieved during 1987/88-1990/91.
The exports are expected to be composed of about 1.5
million tons of domestically produced beet sugar and
300,000 tons of imported raw sugar refined for
reexported sugar.
 
Sugar exports account for about one-quarter of
Ukraine's total agricultural exports, ranking second
only to grains, which account for about one-half of
total exports. Ukraine's other major agricultural
export commodity is sunflowerseed.
 
Of total beet sugar exports for 1995/96, 1.76 million
tons, or nearly 90 percent, are expected to be
shipped to Russia and other republics of the FSU. The
remaining 10 percent is expected to be exported to
neighboring countries. According to International
Sugar Organization (ISO) statistics for 1994, Ukraine
supplied nearly 40 percent or 1.5 million tons of the
total sugar imports of the FSU-12 and Baltic States.
The Russian Federation, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and
Azerbaijan were the major destinations in terms of
volume. For several FSU republics--Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Moldova, and Tajikistan--Ukraine accounted
for two-thirds or more of their sugar imports.
 
Non-FSU markets for Ukraine in recent years have
included Bulgaria, Romania, and China. With
Turkey--Ukraine's major regional export
competition--shifting from a net exporter to a net
importer position this season due to a fall-off in
production, Ukraine could capture an increased share
of the import markets in Albania, Romania, the former
Yugosolvia, Iran, and Iraq, as well as Turkey. In
1993 and 1994, Turkey exported 90,711 and 62,492
tons, respectively, to the FSU-12 republics of
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation, Tajikistan,
and Uzbekistan. However, Ukraine likely will be
unable to fill the void left by Turkey in 1995/96
because of insufficient availability. USDA forecasts
1995/96 sugar imports by FSU-12 (excluding Ukraine
and Russian Federation) and Baltic States will total
about 1.8 million tons, raw value.
 
Ukraine's major trading partner has been Russia,
which mainly trades oil for Ukraine's sugar.
Traditionally, Ukraine has exported to Russia, the
world's largest sugar importer, a combination of
domestically produced beet sugar as well as imported
raw cane sugar refined in Ukrainian facilities.
During the 1980's, around 2.0 million tons of
imported raw sugar were refined annually. This raw
cane sugar, mainly of Cuban origin, was tolled in
Ukraine as part of the FSU's barter exchange of Cuban
sugar for Russian oil. In recent years, sugar
refining has been largely a commercial activity, with
volume depending upon the level of the refined
premium--the difference between the prices of refined
and raw sugar. As table A-2 reveals, imports of raw
sugar into Ukraine dropped sharply since the late
1980's, reflecting the fact that the refined premium
has generally not been high enough for toll refining
to be commercially viable.
 
USDA expects Russia's sugar imports to increase from
2.7 million tons in 1994/95 to about 3.0 million in
1995/96. According to Russian Customs Committee data,
in calendar year 1994, Russia imported 2.2 million
tons of sugar, of which Cuba accounted for 911,711
tons or 42 percent and Ukraine 681,502 tons or 31
percent. For the first half of 1995, (January-June),
Russia's raw sugar imports from Cuba totaled 364,757
tons, 59 percent of total raw imports. Ukraine
provided 508,439 tons of Russia's refined sugar, 81
percent of the total of refined imports.
Historically, Russia imported raw and refined sugar
in about equal amounts, but the share of raw sugar
has increased in the last 3 years, with 1995/96 raw
imports forecast at about 55 percent compared with 48
percent in 1993/94. The reason for this change is a
higher import tariff for refined sugar (25 percent)
compared with raw sugar (1 percent). Also since April
1995, imports of refined sugar have been subject to a
10-percent value-added-tax (VAT) and a special tax of
1.5 percent. The VAT on raw sugar, however, is 20
percent. However, the refined sugar import tariff of
25 percent does not apply to other FSU republics such
as Ukraine.
 
It is expected that 200,000 to 300,000 tons of raw
sugar will enter Ukraine during 1995/96 for refining
and reexport. Under Ukraine's tolling and reexport
regulations, imports of raw sugar for tolling have to
be re-exported within 90 days or be subject to the
Ukrainian import tax. Ukraine applies a 10-percent
import duty on either raw or refined sugar. A
20-percent VAT is also applied to raw sugar imports,
unless they are re-exported.

Ukraine's sugar import flows are controlled by
Ukrsakhar under an import license system. Ukrsakhar
is also responsible for export deliveries against
intergovernmental agreements with other FSU republics
and for refined sugar exports from imported raw sugar
based on tolling contracts with international sugar
trade houses. Export licenses are issued by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade.
 
Prospects for the Future
Industry in Transition
Ukraine's sugarbeet growers, processing sector
officials, and government policy makers continue to
try to bring greater economic incentives, production
efficiencies, and market reform to the country's
sugar industry. The outlook is uncertain with respect
to production, consumption, trade, and the
reorganization of the industry.
 
Production--The data clearly point to a significant
gulf between the technical performance of Ukraine's
sugar industry and those in Western Europe and the
United States. While this indicates the generally
poor state of Ukrainian sugarbeet agriculture, it
suggests that with application of appropriate
technologies (i.e. seed, fertilizers, chemicals) and
financial support, Ukraine could increase sugar
production. For example, assuming current area in
sugarbeet, a 15-percent increase in beet yields from
the late 1980's level to 35 tons per hectare--still
well below the level regularly achieved in western
Europe--would raise sugarbeet production to around 50
million tons. Assuming average recovery rates for the
past four seasons of 12.7 percent, beet sugar
production could total about 6.0 million tons, up by
nearly 50 percent from recent levels.

While a larger volume of sugarbeets would help the
general throughput problem of Ukraine's processing
sector, the industry is clearly in need of capital
investment and restructuring. One plan mentioned with
this focus concerns the building of a 12,000 ton
plant in Zhytomyr oblast and closing five small
nearby mills.
 
There are several factors that are likely to
determine the direction of production over the next
few years. On the positive side there are factors
that would encourage an increase in Ukraine's sugar
production. These include greater export
opportunities in Russia, other FSU countries, and the
world market. On the negative side there are factors
that could cause further contraction. These include
the immense needs in capital investments, the
increasing energy costs of the processing sector, and
a view that sugar production should be only large
enough to meet domestic consumption needs, and
resources should be shifted to more remunerative
crops or activities. 

Consumption--Ukraine's per capita sugar consumption
remains high. However, high sugar prices and low
consumer purchasing power are likely to continue to
curb demand growth until incomes improve. Ukraine's
population, now estimated at 52 million, is growing
slowly, so no significant increase is foreseen in
total sugar consumption. What may change over time is
a use pattern from one dominated directly by
consumers to one of greater consumption of
sugar-containing food products from an expanding
western-style food processing industry.
 
Trade--It is very likely that Ukraine could expand
sugar exports if it is able to raise production.
Assuming no change in consumption, production of
around 6 million tons would leave an annual
exportable surplus of around 4.0 million tons, the
same level achieved in the late 1980's. Markets are
available to Ukraine both within the FSU and in
neighboring countries. The magnitude of these exports
will depend ultimately upon such factors as the
industry's production costs, the price it receives
from world market sales, and the price it receives
from domestic sales. Moreover, the need to improve
the general quality of sugar for export will also
determine how competitive Ukraine will be in
international markets.
 
The role of tolling raw sugar for Russia is a
question mark. Russia will remain a large importer of
sugar. Ukraine has sugar refinery capacity and a
developed infrastructure for unloading raws and
shipping refined products. The level of exports to
Russia is likely to continue to depend on
intergovernment agreements on fuel and sugar, the
raw-refined price premimiun, and border taxes--such
as the waiving of the import tariff on refined sugar
from other FSU countries. 
 
Policy Reform--Ukraine's sugar industry faces many
underlying structural problems that have not been
addressed in the initial transition from the old
Soviet command economy. The privatization initiative
is an important first step for a long term
development strategy. However, it remains to be seen
whether this launches a new restructuring process
that will encourage investment and improve
availability of some of the inputs and technologies
available to beet sugar industries in Western Europe
and the United States. 

Unresolved is a comprehensive policy concerning the
country's sugarbeet factories. To cut the high cost
of sugar production, a large number of the small, old
sugar factories with low efficiency would have to be
closed. However, a sizable shut-down of factories
would increase rural unemployment. Clearly the
privatization and potential factory modernization
strategies will be pivotal to the future vitality of
the Ukrainian sugar industry. In addition, seeming
contradictions among different Ukrainian
Parliamentary acts pertaining to enterprise
privatization could seriously limit privatization of
Ukrainian agricultural enterprises.
 
Moreover, transition to a domestic market where
prices are based on supply and demand forces and
payments are made in currency is also essential.
These programs and policies will not be easy to
formulate or implement and the temptation to solve
the industry's underlying structural problems by
government intervention will remain strong.

-TELEGRAFIX: Telegrafix brings lightning-fast
multimedia to Internet for under $100

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-TELEGRAFIX: Telegrafix
brings lightning-fast multimedia to Internet for
under $100 -- Free communications software and Web
access offered during release of new "RIP-2" online
publishing technology
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- Online publishers can create
television-style multimedia presentations that fly
through the Internet and ordinary telephone lines
with new software available now for under $100 from
TeleGrafix Communications Inc.

RIPaint-2 "universal online multimedia" publishing
software is based on the second generation of
TeleGrafix's world-standard RIPscrip (Remote Imaging
Protocol script) multimedia technology. Following two
years of development, RIP-2 technology brings
unparalleled speed and quality to online graphics.
Complex graphical information such as World Wide Web
pages can be transmitted and displayed at dazzling
speeds over low-bandwidth residential telephone lines
using low-speed modems. 

"RIP-2 is a telecommunications marvel that brings
sizzle to cyberspace. The graphics are gorgeous and
they travel through networks like greased lightning,"
said TeleGrafix President/CEO Patrick Clawson. 

RIP-2 technology dramatically speeds up transmission
and display of online multimedia by encoding graphics
as hyper- compressed ASCII text files that are as
little as one-tenth the size of other graphics
formats. RIP-2 also introduces many new elements to
online publishing, including multiple-column screen
layouts. RIP-2 is the only online multimedia
technology that can transmitted via the Internet or
any communications link without special protocols,
dedicated servers or other custom software. 

TeleGrafix also has released its new "shareware"
RIPterm v2.2. multimedia communications software, a
general-purpose communications program that also
operates as a HTML-3 and Netscape-compliant Web
browser when used with TeleGrafix's upcoming RIPweb
World Wide Web access technology.

A demonstration of RIP-2 multimedia can be viewed on
TeleGrafix's Vector Sector BBS at +1 714 379-2133.
RIPterm v2.2 and technical information can be
downloaded there and at http://www.telegrafix.com on
the World Wide Web.

RIP-2 COMPATIBLE WITH ANY COMPUTER ONLINE SYSTEM
RIPaint-2 is a powerful online publishing tool that
makes it simple for anyone to create multimedia
electronic newspapers and information services with
point-and-click and drag-and- drop simplicity. Online
publishers can create television-style production
effects with a powerful, easy-to-use WYSIWIG
multimedia editor that integrates JPEG photographic
images, complex SVGA graphics, text and digital WAV
sound into a single screen. The technology supports
16.7 million colors and can use Adobe and TrueType
style fonts. It uses the device-independent bitmap
(BMP/DIB) icon format to make screen images appear to
be virtually identical when viewed on both PC and
Macintosh computers.

The initial release of RIP-2 software is in DOS
format for speed, with a unique Windows-style
interface for point-and-click simplicity, and for use
with BBS and corporate online information systems.
Windows and Macintosh versions of RIP-2 products are
scheduled for release in early 1996, along with
"plug-ins" for Netscape and other popular Internet
browsers that will permit the viewing of RIP-2
multimedia on World Wide Web pages.

RIP-2 technology has been designed to operate with
any online system regardless of whether a particular
BBS or Internet server system manufacturer provides
support in its internal system architecture. Unlike
proprietary imaging systems, RIP-2 is fully
compatible with the Internet and any wired or
wireless communications networks that use 7-bit or
8-bit ASCII text. TeleGrafix will publish the RIP-2
multimedia language specification for use as an
international online multimedia standard in the first
quarter of 1996.

RIPAINT IS INEXPENSIVE, LIBERAL UPGRADE POLICY
RIPaint-2 multimedia publishing software is available
for US$99.95 through January 31, 1996. Customers
ordering during the introductory period will receive
a bonus of 25 complimentary copies of TeleGrafix's
new RIPterm v2.2 "universal client" multimedia
communications software, valued at $500, along with
free Internet and World Wide Web access. Customers
are free to resell the bonus copies of RIPterm and
keep all proceeds. On February 1, 1996, the price of
RIPaint-2 will increase to US$199.95, and the bonus
RIPterm gift will be discontinued.

Customers who purchased RIPaint v1.54 after March 1,
1994 are eligible for a free upgrade to RIPaint-2
with electronic documentation. Printed documentation
is available for an additional fee of US$20.
Customers who purchased RIPaint v1.54 prior to March
1, 1994 may upgrade to RIPaint-2 with electronic
documentation for US$34.95, and with printed
documentation for US$49.95. All RIPaint-2 orders will
be shipped in North America via Federal Express. A
shipping and handling fee of US$15 must accompany all
new orders and upgrade requests for U.S. domestic
customers. International orders and those from Alaska
and Hawaii are subject to higher shipping and
handling fees. TeleGrafix accepts American Express,
Visa and MasterCard. 

RIPTERM GOES SHAREWARE, SYSOPS & WEBMASTERS TO PROFIT
RIPterm v2.2 is being distributed as DOS "shareware"
for individual and non-commercial users, with a
US$19.95 registration fee. Commercial and government
organizations must license RIPterm prior to use, and
inexpensive site licenses are available.

Sysops and webmasters who join the new TeleGrafix
Associates Program prior to January 31, 1996 can
receive sales commissions by distributing RIP-2
software on their online systems, with no financial
risk on their part. 

Each TeleGrafix Associate will receive special
RIPterm shareware containing a unique identification
number for public posting on their BBS or Web system.
They will receive a sales commission of US$5.00 for
each copy of RIPterm originating from their system
that end-users register with TeleGrafix. A 10%
commission will be paid from sales of RIPaint-2 and
other TeleGrafix software products. Commissions will
be paid monthly in U.S. Dollars. No commissions will
be paid on the initial 25 complimentary copies of
RIPterm v2.2 that are included with all RIPaint-2
sales. There is no charge to enroll in the TeleGrafix
Associates Program. 

FREE WEB ACCESS TO TELEGRAFIX CUSTOMERS
Finally, TeleGrafix is providing free World Wide Web
access to customers who want to test drive the
company's experimental RIPweb WWW access technology
through January 31, 1996. RIPweb integrates Web
services into existing BBS and online systems,
providing speedy low-bandwidth connections over
ordinary residential phone lines. By eliminating the
need for consumers to have TCP/IP connections (such
as SLIP or PPP accounts) as a prerequisite for
Internet access, electronic publishers can greatly
expand their potential audiences.

Developed in partnership with X-Telnet Oy of Espoo,
Finland, RIPweb automatically translates HTML to
RIP-2 "on the fly," and supports HTML-3, including
tables, background images, text color and background
color specifications. The initial version of RIPweb
is written in Linux, and other UNIX versions are
under development.

To experience RIPweb's capabilities and enjoy free
World Wide Web access, RIPterm v2.2 users may dial
714-379-2134, and login as "guest." After an icon
download lasting about five minutes, users can travel
the World Wide Web without paying any Internet access
or time charges. Normal telephone toll charges do
apply.

RDATE:251295

HIGHLIGHTS:
Heavy snow from an early-week winter storm fell from
the Texas plains to Pennsylvania, bringing
much-needed moisture to small grain fields. Rain in
the southern Great Plains provided some relief to
wheat fields that were not already damaged from the
extended dry weather. In Florida, brief durations of
below-freezing temperatures did negligible damage to
citrus trees.

Low-volume irrigation continued in citrus groves
where leaf curl and wilt were evident. Harvest of
oranges for processing was active throughout
Florida's citrus region. Freezing weather burned some
of Florida's vegetable crops' leaves, but the extent
of the damage had not been determined. In the
southern Great Plains and the Delta States, minor
insect problems in small grains were reported in some
early wheat fields. Wheat in the Midwest was in
mostly good condition before the snow arrived. A dry
week was welcomed in the Pacific Northwest where some
standing water remained in low-land fields from last
week's storm. Light rainfall limited fieldwork in
northern California, while farther south, citrus
growers continued to pick fruit.

National Weather Summary Volume 82, No. 52 December
17 - 23, 1995 For additional information, call (202)
720-7917.

Highlights:
Quiet weather prevailed along the West Coast after
last week's major storm, owing to the development of
a jet-stream split over the eastern Pacific. Energy
coursing into the southern branch of the split jet
spurred the development of a significant storm. The
early- to midweek system eased drought in the central
and southern Plains, delivered heavy snow from the
Southwest to the Northeast, and dropped heavy rain on
the Gulf Coast States. In the storm's wake,
temperatures showed a remarkable uniformity,
resulting in above-normal readings in the North and
below-normal values across the South. Early in the
week, 4 to 10 inches of rain fell from eastern Texas
to northwestern Florida, causing widespread flash
flooding and minor river flooding. Two-day (December
17-18) totals reached 8.89 inches in Beaumont, TX,
8.84 inches in Lafayette, LA, and 7.68 inches in
Mobile, AL.

In addition to the heavy rain, severe weather,
including more than a dozen tornadoes, raked the
region. Meanwhile, urgently needed precipitation fell
across the central and southern Plains. In Lubbock,
TX, 0.45 inches of rain on Sunday ended a 75-day dry
spell, leaving the city 2 days shy of its
February-April 1972 all-time record. Dodge City, KS
measured 0.48 inches (5.0 inches of snow),
quadrupling their October 1 - December 15 total.
Storm-total snowfall on the southern Plains, whipped
by wind gusts in excess of 30 mph, reached 2.7 inches
in Amarillo, TX and 4.0 inches in Oklahoma City, OK.
Las Vegas, NM reported a maximum depth of 7 inches.
The northwestern half of the central Plains remained
critically dry, however. In Tribune, KS, only 0.13
inches of precipitation fell during the astronomical
autumn (September 23 - December 22), breaking a
record that had stood since 1939, when 0.18 inches
fell. Farther east, heavy rain fell as far north as
the lower Ohio River Valley, with heavy snow and ice
accumulations observed from the Midwest into the
Northeast.

December 18-19 snowfall topped 8 inches from central
Indiana to New England, driven by
north-to-northeasterly wind gusts that reached 43 mph
in Cleveland, OH (15.3 inches of snow) and 39 mph in
Indianapolis, IN (8.0 inches). In Youngstown, OH, an
11.6-inch total on Tuesday was their greatest
single-day December snowfall. The storm boosted the
astronomical-autumn snowfall to a record 25.4 inches
(three times normal) in Harrisburg, PA. Elsewhere in
the Northeast, snowfall included 10.0 inches in
Bridgeport, CT, 15.0 inches at New York City's La
Guardia Airport, and 15.7 inches in Portland, ME. The
storm dislodged remnant arctic air from northern
Maine that, on Sunday, resulted in minima as low as
-14 degrees F in Caribou and -9 degrees F in Houlton.
Although the storm stalled over southeastern Canada
after midweek, the resultant northwesterly flow
failed to deliver bitterly cold air.

East of the Rockies, the Nation's lowest temperature
after midweek was -12 degrees F, recorded on Friday
morning in Williston, ND. But the persistent flow
chilled the South, where on Thursday, Atlanta, GA
marked the first of 4 consecutive days with a high of
40 degrees F or below. On Saturday, the Nation's
highest reported temperature was 68 degrees F, in Key
West, FL. Farther north, cloudy, squally weather
plagued the Great Lakes States, where Pittsburgh, PA
spent 94 of the week's last 111 hours engulfed in
snow showers. Arctic air also remained absent from
the West, although in high-elevation valleys, lows on
Saturday morning dipped to -4 degrees F in Gallup, NM
and -12 degrees F in Ely, NV. Farther south,
late-week moisture streaked eastward, whitening the
southern Rockies and dampening Florida and southern
Texas. By Saturday morning, 4 inches of new snow
covered Red River, NM. Additional southern-stream
energy moved through southern California on Saturday,
delivering 0.77 inches of rain to Los Angeles.

-BELL ATLANTIC: Bell Atlantic ushers in new year with
$8 million in customer savings

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BELL ATLANTIC: Bell
Atlantic ushers in new year with $8 million in
customer savings -- Touch-Tone price decreases by
one-third; other prices reduced
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- Bell Atlantic-West Virginia
customers will ring in the new year with $8 million
in savings, as the company is cutting by one-third
its prices for Touch-Tone service. Prices for two of
the company's local service plans also are
decreasing, and customers in several locations will
enjoy expanded unlimited calling within their local
calling areas.

Residential customers of Bell Atlantic-West Virginia
now will pay $1 a month for Touch-Tone service, down
from $1.50 a month. Business customers will pay $1.84
a month, down from $2.75 a month. These prices will
decrease by another third on Jan. 1, 1997, and will
be eliminated on Jan. 1, 1998.

In addition, prices will decrease for two residential
basic local service plans, Community Caller and
Frequent Caller. Community Caller, which offers
customers unlimited calling within their own
exchanges and measured calling to other exchanges in
their local calling area, now will cost $15 a month,
down from $15.80 a month. Frequent Caller, which
offers unlimited calling to all exchanges in a
customer's local calling area, will cost $29 a month,
down from $36.15 a month.

"These reductions are great news for hundreds of
thousands of our West Virginia customers whose
telephone bills will decrease," said Dennis Bone,
president and CEO of Bell Atlantic-West Virginia,
Inc. "These cuts, combined with price reductions
earlier this year for Bell Atlantic-carried long
distance calls and reductions as a result of prior
regulatory agreements, will save customers more than
$35 million a year by the end of 1998."

The latest price reductions are part of a 1994
agreement reached by Bell Atlantic, the West Virginia
Public Service Commission [PSC] staff and the PSC's
Consumer Advocate Division. This agreement provides
for continued price stability, with several price
reductions, through January 1998 while maintaining a
regulatory framework that provides Bell Atlantic with
incentives to continue to invest in its advanced
Mountain State telecommunications network.

With the current regulatory agreement, prices for
local service and Bell Atlantic-carried long distance
calls will have decreased or remained stable from
1985 through early 1998 -- nearly 13 years. 

Unlimited local calling areas expanded for certain
customers

In another change that becomes effective Dec. 31,
Bell Atlantic will expand local calling for its
Community Plus Caller customers in the following
exchanges:

* Calls between the Gilbert [664] and Iaeger [938]
exchanges. 

* Calls between the Fairmont [363, 366, 367, 368,
534] and Grafton [265] exchanges.

* Calls between the Hinton [466] and Meadow Bridge
[484] exchanges. 

* Calls made by customers in the Griffithsville [524]
exchange to the Hamlin [824] exchange.

Customers in these areas who subscribe to Bell
Atlantic's Community Plus Caller local service will
have unlimited local calling between these exchanges.

Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at the
forefront of the new communications, entertainment
and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,
the company is the premier provider of local
telecommunications and advanced services. Globally,
it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth
wireless communication marketplace. Bell Atlantic
also owns a substantial interest in Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing
high-growth national and international business
opportunities in all phases of the industry.

December Prices Received Index Continues to Rise The
All Farm Products Index of Prices Received in
December was 107 based on 1990-92=100, up 1 point
(0.9 percent) from November. Price gains from
November for corn, hogs, soybeans, and eggs more than
offset price declines for broilers, turkeys, lemons,
and lettuce. The seasonal changes in the mix of
commodities farmers sell also can affect the overall
index level, but these changes were essentially
offsetting in December. Higher relative seasonal
marketings of wheat, tobacco, milk, and cotton offset
the effect of relatively lower seasonal marketings of
cattle, corn, soybeans, and grapes. Compared with
December 1994, the All Farm Products Index was 9
points (9.2 percent) higher. Higher year over year
prices for corn, hogs, wheat, and soybeans more than
offset lower prices for virtually all vegetables,
cattle, and calves. 

Prices Received by Farmers The December All Farm
Products Index was 107 percent of its 1990-92 base,
up 0.9 percent from November and 9.2 percent above
December 1994. All Crops: The December index, at 117,
was up 0.9 percent from November and 10 percent above
December 1994. Higher grain, oilseed, and cotton
prices in December more than offset lower vegetable
prices.

Oil-Bearing Crops: The index was 118, up 4.4 percent
from November and 20 percent above one year ago.
Higher prices for soybeans and peanuts more than
offset lower prices for cottonseed and sunflowers.
Soybean prices averaged $6.71 per bushel, up 32 cents
from the previous month. Dry weather concerns in
South America and good export demand are supporting
prices.

Food Grains: The December index, at 162, was up 3.2
percent from the previous month and 33 percent above
December 1994. Prices were higher for wheat and rice.
The December wheat price averaged $4.92 per bushel,
the highest since March 1974. Lower projected world
supplies and good export demand are supporting
prices.

Feed Grains & Hay: The December index was 132, up 5.6
percent from the previous month and 38 percent from
December 1994. Prices were higher for all feed
grains. The December corn price averaged $3.08 per
bushel, the highest since August 1984. The December
sorghum price averaged $5.66 per cwt, the highest
since November 1974. Tight supplies and strong export
demand continue to support feed grain prices.
Commercial Vegetables: The December index, at 93, was
9 percent below November and 42 percent below
December 1994. Contributing most to the monthly index
decline were lower prices for lettuce, celery, and
tomatoes pressured by ample supplies.

Fruit & Nuts: The December fruit and nuts index, at
84, declined 13 percent from the previous month but
was 17 percent above December 1994. Price increases
from November for apples, grapes, oranges, and
strawberries were more than offset by the effect of
lower grape marketings coupled with higher orange
marketings.

Livestock & Products: The December index was 96, up
2.1 percent from November and 6.7 percent above a
year ago. Higher hog and egg prices in December more
than offset lower poultry and cattle prices.

Meat Animals: The December meat animals index, at 84,
was up 2.4 percent from November and 1.2 percent from
December a year ago. The December hog price, at
$44.30 per cwt, increased $4.40 from November and was
$13.50 above the previous year. December weekly hog
slaughter levels have been running 5-10 percent below
year earlier numbers. December beef cattle prices
dropped slightly in December to $60.60, 10 cents
below a month earlier and $3.80 below December a year
ago.

Poultry & Eggs: The December index was 118, down 1.7
percent from November but up 15 percent from a year
earlier. Broiler and turkey prices declined
seasonally as demand typically increases for pork in
December. Both broiler and turkey prices are at
higher December levels than in recent years. Egg
prices continued to climb on strong seasonal use and
also are considerably higher than recent year levels.
Reliability of Prices Received by Farmers Estimates
Definition: Prices received represent sales from
producers to first buyers. They include all grades
and qualities. The average commodity price from the
survey multiplied by the total quantity marketed
theoretically should give the total cash receipts for
the commodity.

Survey Procedures: Primary sales data used to
determine grain prices were obtained from probability
samples of 2600 mills and elevators. These procedures
ensure that virtually all grain moving into
commercial channels has a chance of being included in
the survey. Generally, States surveyed account for 90
percent or more of total U.S. production. Livestock
prices are obtained from packers, stockyards,
auctions, dealers, and market check data from
AMS-USDA, private marketing organizations, and state
commodity groups and agencies. Inter-farm sales of
grain and livestock are not included since they
represent very small percentages of the total
marketings. Grain marketed for seed is also excluded.
Fruit and vegetable prices are obtained from sample
surveys and market check data from AMS-USDA, private
marketing organizations, state agencies, and
universities.

Summary and Estimation Procedures: Survey quantities
sold are expanded by strata to state levels and used
to weight average strata prices to a state average.
State prices are then weighted to a U.S. price based
on expanded marketings. Recommendations are prepared
by the State Statistical Offices and reviewed by the
Agricultural Statistics Board in Washington, D.C.
State recommendations are reviewed for reasonableness
with survey data, other States, and recent historic
estimates.

Revisions: For most items, the current month's price
represents a 3-5 day period around the mid-month.
Previous month's prices represent actual dollars
received for quantities sold during the entire month.
Revisions are published in monthly issues of
"Agricultural Prices" and in the annual summary
published in July. A schedule of monthly revisions is
published in the December issue of "Agricultural
Prices" and in the July annual summary.

Reliability: U.S. price estimates generally have a
sampling error of less than one half percent for the
major commodities such as corn, wheat, soybeans,
cotton, and rice. To assist users in evaluating the
reliability of prices received estimates for major
grain commodities, the "Root Mean Square Error" is
shown in the table on the next page. The "Root Mean
Square Error" is a statistical measure based on past
performance and is computed using the difference
between first and final estimates. The "Root Mean
Square Error" for the 5-month corn price is 0.2
percent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 that
the current 5-month price of $2.47 per bushel will
not be above or below the final 5-month price by more
than 0.2 percent, or about half of a cent. Chances
are 9 out of 10 (90% confidence interval) that the
difference will not exceed 0.3 percent, or about
three-fourths of a penny.

respond to customer needs and to communicate the
values that characterise the company and its
commercial offer: freedom, ease of use, courtesy and
transparency. 

The new chain of stores is distinctly unique in both
its internal and external designs.  The floor plan
has been carefully laid out to ensure that customers'
pre and post sale needs are efficiently dealt with by
Omnitel staff.  Thus the store not only offers
handsets, accessories and an activation area but more
important, information and consulting. One corner is
dedicated to the company's                      
cellular service where customers can learn more about
Omnitel's tariff plans (Free Time, Night & Day,
Business Time); there is a display area for both
handsets and accessories; a counter dedicated to
service activation; a service area for post-sale
assistance where customers can pick up their
"complimentary emergency phones" should theirs
require maintenance.  In addition, customers can try
the Omnitel service by making a free telephone call

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MERCURY: Mercury comments
on Oftel licence review
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Mercury Communications responded positively to
today's publication by Oftel of proposals to amend
Mercury's operating licence.

Christopher Weston, Mercury's strategy manager said:
"Competition in the UK telecommunications market has
grown enormously since the end of the duopoly in
1991.  A 'slimline licence' will put us on an equal
footing with other operators in the market, give us
the freedom to compete more effectively and the
flexibility to meet our customers' individual needs.

"We also support the principle of replacing numerous
detailed licence obligations with a general licence
Condition to prevent and deter anti-competitive
behaviour. This would, in our view, provide
sufficient regulatory control in both the domestic
and international markets."

-SINGAPORE TECHNOLOGIES/SINGAPORE TELECOM: Singapore
& Chinese parties sign Asia Pacific comms agreement

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-SINGAPORE TECHNOLOGIES
TELEMEDIA/SINGAPORE TELECOM: Singapore and Chinese
parties sign agreement to provide mobile satellite
communications services in the Asia Pacific
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

Singapore Technologies Telemedia, Singapore Telecom
and four organizations from the People's Republic of
China today signed the Founders' Agreement for the
approximately US$640 million Asia Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications (APMT) project.

The four Chinese organisations are China Satellite
Launch & Tracking Control General, China Aero-Space
Corporation, China Unicorn Satellite
Telecommunication Co Ltd and China Telecommunications
Broadcast Satellite Corp.

Mr Lee Theng Kiat, President of Singapore
Technologies Telemedia, Mr Lim Toon, Executive Vice
President (International Services) of Singapore
Telecom, Mr Li Baoming, Director of China Satellite
Launch & Tracking Control General, Mr Zeng Qinglai,
Chief Engineer of China Aero-Space Corporation, Mr He
Feichang, Deputy Director of China Unicom Satellite
Telecommunication Co Ltd, and Mr Zhou Zehe, President
of China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite
Corporation, signed the Agreement on behalf of their
respective companies.  The signing was witnessed by
Mr Mah Row Tan, Singapore's Minister for
Communications, and General Shen Chun Nian, Vice
Minister of China's Commission of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defence. 

Seamless communications
APMT is a regional mobile satellite project providing
seamless mobile telecommunications services, through
National Service Providers in each country, in the
Asia Pacific region via a geostationary earth orbit
satellite system and a network of ground gateway
stations, The services include voice telephony,
facsimile and data transmission,

Communication is via handheld, vehicular or
fixed-site terminals.  Handheld terminals, the size
of normal cellular phones, will have dual-mode
facility to access either the APMT network or the
local cellular network.  The service will operate
through terrestrial cellular links where they are
available and satellite links where they are not. 
Users thus have the convenience of using their phones
almost anywhere in the region.

Residents and frequent visitors of areas where
cellular and fixed-line services are not available
will find APMT services most useful.  Frequent
business travellers in the region are also expected
to use APMT for roaming purposes.  Coverage will be
available from India in the west to Japan in the
cast, and from China in the north to Indonesia in the
south. 

Service to be launched in 1998
The APMT system is expected to be ready in the middle
of 1998.  A tender has been called for a turn-key
satellite system with a back-up satellite and
associated ground segment facilities.  The bids are
being evaluated and a decision will be announced
soon.

APMT services will be administered by Asia Pacific
Mobile Telecommunications (APMT) Satellite Pte Ltd, a
company incorporated in Singapore.  Initially,
Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Singapore
Telecom will share equally one third of the equity
stake, and the four Chinese parties will share two
thirds of the equity stake in the company.

APMT Satellite Pte Ltd will launch and operate the
APMT satellite system, coordinate with the National
Service Provider (NSP) of each country to set up the
necessary ground communications facilities and sell
air time to the NSPs.  Each NSP, licensed by the

-DUN & BRADSTREET: More than 41,000 businesses
collapse in 1995

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-DUN & BRADSTREET: More
than 41,000 businesses collapse in 1995
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

The drop in the annual rate of business failures in
Britain is disappointingly small accordingly to the
latest statistics on business failures in 1995
published today by Dun & Bradstreet, the business
information service.

41,303 business collapsed during 1995 as compared
with 43,598 during 1994.  The 5.3% drop is small when
compared with the 16-3% recorded between 1994 and
1993.  There was also a 4.6% increase in larger
company liquidations (from 16,335 to 17,280).  This
is the first increase in company liquidations for the
past three years.

More than 6,000 larger companies in London were
liquidated compared to 4,700 in 1994 an increase of
28%.  This large increase was in pan compensated for
by a 20% decrease in smaller business bankruptcies. 
But overall annual business failures in the capital
rose by 14%. 

NU Philip Mellor, D&B's Senior Analyst, said:
"There are worrying signs in these figures that
company liquidations are beginning to rise again in
the North and Scotland as well as in London, For the
past nine months we have witnessed an increasing
trend in company liquidations in the capital which
has now spread to other parts of the country.  It
remains to be seen in the coming months what impart
this will have on smaller companies."

During the last quarter of the year the number of
business failures in the North West increased by a
quarter from W to 1,054 and in the North East they
increased by 16% from 847 to 986, The disappointing
last quarter's figures meant there was little decline
in the overall business failure rates in both these
regions during the year.

In Scotland the business failure rate increased by
22% but because the law relating to bankruptcy in
Scotland differs to that in England and Wales, no
valid comparisons can be made between business
failure rates in Scotland and those in the rest of
Britain. 

Wales emerges as the region of the country with the
biggest decrease in business failures.  During 1995
the business failure rate dropped by 19% and there
were big falls in the business failure rate in the
south west (18.5%) and the South East (16.6%),

-INDUSTRY CANADA: Real gross domestic product at
factor cost by industry -- October 1995

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDUSTRY CANADA: Real
gross domestic product at factor cost by industry --
October 1995
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Economic activity declined after growing moderately
during the summer months. Gross domestic product at
factor cost fell 0.3% in October, as domestic and
foreign demand retreated. The drop left production
0.3% below its most recent peak in January 1995. The
weakness was widespread, spanning several industrial
sectors.

Retailers suffered lower sales for a second
consecutive month. The weakness in consumer spending
was also evident in community, business and personal
services, as reflected in lower sales by lottery
corporations. Lower housing resales restrained growth
in the finance group.

Two sectors dropped the most: transportation and
storage services; and mining. These two sectors
accounted for approximately 45% of the overall
decline. Wholesale trade and the output of utilities
also receded. Manufacturing production and
construction activity were unchanged. 

Consumers reduced their spending once more
Retail sales fell 0.7% in October, after slipping
0.3% in September. Sales dropped in 11 of the 18
trade groups in October. Motor vehicle dealers posted
lower sales for a second consecutive month; after
slowing in September, the number of new vehicles sold
slumped 7.4% in October. Purchases of clothing
continued to fall, while spending on furniture and
household appliances eased for a second month in a
row.

Note to readers
The gross domestic product (GDP) of an industry is
the value added by factors of production when those
factors transform inputs purchased from other
industries into output.

Monthly GDP by industry is valued at 1986 prices. The
estimates presented here are seasonally adjusted at
annual rates. 

Widespread decline in wholesale trade
Wholesalers lost ground (sales fell 0.8%), after
gaining ground in August and September. As in retail
trade, sales of motor vehicles and parts and of
household goods deteriorated. Lower sales of
machinery and equipment and petroleum products
accentuated the overall decline. By contrast, grain
merchants and wholesalers of farm machinery posted
strong gains.

Mining sector slumped
After strengthening in each of the previous four
months, output in the mining sector fell 1.3% in
October. Production of crude oil and natural gas
decreased 0.6%. Natural gas production, which dropped
only marginally, has remained at almost the same
level since April 1995. With generally weak demand,
the price of natural gas has fallen steadily
throughout 1995. Although demand for natural gas
continued to weaken on domestic markets in October,
foreign demand has been firming up since August.

Coal production dropped 2.8%, following peak levels
of production between July and September. In October,
exports of coal returned to normal levels, but output
by thermal electric utilities fell sharply again.

Less drilling activity and lower production in base
metal mines also contributed to the weakness in the
mining sector.

Growth in manufacturing production paused
Manufacturing production was unchanged in October,
after improving during the previous three months.
Output was still 1.0% lower than its peak in January
1995. Production of primary metals and of electrical
and electronic equipment fell the most. Manufacturers
of paper and refined petroleum products also cut
their output.

Output in the wood industries continued to improve;
some of the production-mainly lumber-was accumulated
in inventories. Elsewhere in the wood industries, a
recent increase in the backlog of unfilled orders may
signal higher production in the coming months.
Manufacturers of chemical, plastic and metal
fabricated products were also among the producers who
raised output the most. Production of transportation
equipment advanced despite a decline in motor vehicle
assembly.

Output of primary metals fell 3.6% in October. The
weakness reflected a 6.6% decline in smelting and
refining of non-ferrous metals; production of primary
aluminum was affected by a labour dispute. Lower
nickel production accentuated the drop in the primary
metals industry.

Production of electrical and electronic equipment
fell 1.7%, reflecting a sharp decline in production
of office machinery. The decrease coincided with a
sharp drop in exports of office machinery and
equipment.

Manufacturers of pulp and paper products were
responsible for a 1.4% decline in the paper and
allied products industries. Foreign demand for pulp
tumbled in October, while shipments of newsprint to
the United States fell significantly. Despite the
strong declines in exports, manufacturers of pulp and
newsprint maintained production and accumulated
inventories.

Production of motor vehicle parts led a 0.8% gain in
transportation equipment production. However, part of
the production went into inventory, as motor vehicle
assemblers reduced their demand. In October,
production of motor vehicles fell in Canada and the
United States. Production in the aircraft industry
continued to gain momentum, however.

Growth in transportation services eased
Growth in transportation and storage services eased
(-1.5%), reflecting declines in air, rail and truck
transport. In rail transport, carloadings of most
commodities fell-especially alumina, coal and
containers-while carloadings of grain rose
substantially. A 2.4% decline in the transportation
of natural gas added to the overall weakness.

Activity in construction remains uncertain
Activity in construction was unchanged in October.
Declines in home-building and non-residential
construction offset a gain in engineering
construction. Home-building fell 0.9%, due mainly to
weakness in the construction of apartments.
Construction of single dwellings inched ahead and,
for the first time since June 1994, improved for two
consecutive months. In October, the number of
building permits issued rebounded, mainly for
multiple dwellings. Activity on non-residential
building projects fell marginally following strong
growth during the summer months. In October, activity
on industrial projects continued to rise, but
activity eased on commercial projects. 

Other industries
Output in the finance group advanced 0.2%, after
slipping 0.2% in September. Real estate sales fell in
several provinces for a second month in a row;
however, advances by securities brokers, mutual funds
and stock exchanges were enough to offset the drop.

The output of utilities fell a further 1.3%, as
demand for electricity and natural gas continued to
sag.

The October 1995 issue of Gross domestic product by
industry (15-001, $14/$140) will be released in
January 1996.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDUSTRY CANADA:
Employment, earnings and hours -- October 1995
(preliminary)
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

The number of people employed by businesses was
unchanged in October at 10,746,000. Employment
increased in business services and in finance,
insurance and real estate, but declined in retail
trade and miscellaneous services. Since January 1995,
businesses have added on average 12,000 employees to
their payrolls each month. This pace of growth was
50% slower than in 1994. Since the beginning of the
year, employment gains have been led by community,
business and personal services; manufacturers; and
retail and wholesale trade establishments. Public
administration was the only industry to report a
substantial employment decline during this period.

Provincially, the gains in employment since the
beginning of the year have been focussed mainly in
Ontario and British Columbia; to a lesser extent,
there have been gains in Quebec and New Brunswick.

Table: Employment gains from January to October 1995

Ontario                           51,000
British Columbia                  41,000
Quebec                            29,000
New Brunswick                      8,000

Employees' weekly earnings, after increasing by $4.75
in August, have since remained stable. During the
past year, employees' earnings have increased by only
$5.96 per week (+1.0%). During the same period, the
rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price
index rose 2.4%.

Higher than average earnings increases were
registered for employees in finance, insurance and
real estate as well as mining, quarrying and oil
wells. Employees in public administration and in
logging and forestry services saw their earnings
decline.

Manufacturers maintained recent gains
Manufacturers employed slightly more workers in
October, maintaining the strong gains of the previous
two months. This easing of employment growth
coincided with a dampening of manufacturers'
shipments, a contraction in unfilled orders and an
expansion of inventories. Manufacturers have been one
of the stronger sectors maintaining growth in the
economy in 1995. They have added 4,200 employees on
average to their payrolls each month since January
1995, compared with an average of 3,700 employees per
month in 1994. Average hours for manufacturing
employees paid by the hour have strengthened in
recent months, after following a declining trend
since the start of the year. Similarly, strong
earnings growth in August and September was
maintained in October, as earnings were unchanged.
These recent gains more than offset the drop in
earnings during the first seven months of the year. 

Growth stalled for retailers
Following no change in September, the number of
employees in retail trade fell by 11,000 in October.
The recent movement in retail trade employment has
run counter to the increasing trend observed since
October 1994. It also coincides with retail sales,
which fell in October after remaining stable in
September. The drop in retail employment and sales
was most evident in Ontario. Employees' weekly
earnings rose 0.4% in October to $346.06. Following
substantial monthly fluctuations, earnings in retail
trade returned to the April 1995 level.

Fluctuations continued in miscellaneous services
Fluctuations in the number of employees in
miscellaneous services, which began in the fall of
1994, continued in October with a decrease of 7,000
employees. (Miscellaneous services includes
amusement, recreation, personal, and household
services, membership organizations and other
services.) These strong monthly fluctuations left
employment down slightly from its August 1994 peak.
In October, the drop was concentrated in British
Columbia, and affected mainly amusement and
recreation services.

In October, weekly earnings for employees continued a
growth trend that began in April 1995. Average
earnings in miscellaneous services rose 0.8% in
September, to $394.45.

Employment declined again in public administration,
but at a slower pace 
The declining trend in public administration
employment accelerated between January and July 1995.
On average, this sector reduced employment by 3,000
employees per month during this period. Since then,
the rate of decline has slowed; the number of
employees declined by only 700 since July. During the
past three months, declines continued in federal and
provincial administrations. These were partly offset
by increased employment in local administration.
Weekly earnings for public administration employees
were 0.6% less than in October 1994.

Special trade contractors reduced employment
Construction companies cut employment by 4,000 in
October. The decline was concentrated among special
trade contractors, who reduced their number of
employees by 6,000. The declining trend in
residential construction employment since the start
of 1995 appears to have halted, as the number of
employees increased for the fifth time in six months.
This coincided with recent growth in the value of
residential building permits.

(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

A second edition of a directory that has been
described as 'essential for decision-makers' has just
been published by telecommunications consultants,
Analysys. 

The World Telecoms Marketplace, 1996 opens a window
onto one of the world's fastest-moving industries. 
The directory and databook contains details of the
world's telecoms operators, service providers,
manufacturers and regulators, including the names of
senior staff.  More than 1900 organisations, 6500
named contacts, and over 135 countries are covered. 
It also has invaluable market data segmented by
product, region or company type. 

Dr Pekka Tarjanne (Secretary-General of the
International Telecommunication Union) states in his
Foreword to the directory that it supplies, "the
information which is essential for decision-makers
who need to make their way around the labyrinth of
the telecoms industry." 

Information is provided in a flexibly accessible
manner via cross-referenced indexes.  These allow the
user to discover information on the basis of product,
service category, geographical region, or individual
organisation.

It is the only directory of its kind produced by
dedicated telecoms consultants.  Editor Michael
Denmead said:
"The World Telecoms Marketplace 1996 has its roots in
the wealth of contacts and experience our consultancy
work has produced.  It is a single-source reference
for telecoms professionals, procurement managers, and
sales and marketing teams."

The World Telecoms Marketplace 1996 does not just
cover the major players and global service providers. 
It is a source of primary information on the small
and medium sized enterprises which increasingly
comprise an important part of the telecoms sector. 
These include the emerging mobile and new network
operators who are attracted by the opportunities
around the world which are being created by
liberalisation.  Also to be found within its pages
are the service providers and software development
companies which have sprung up to provide support
services based on the development of intelligent
telecoms networks.

-INFORMIX: Informix to acquire Illustra Information
Technologies

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INFORMIX: Informix to
acquire Illustra Information Technologies --
Combination to give significant technology lead in
database market
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

Informix, the open distributed data management
company, today announced an agreement to acquire
Oakland, Calif.-based Illustra Information
Technologies, Inc., the leading supplier of dynamic
content management database software and tools for
managing complex data in the Internet,
multimedia/entertainment, financial services and
earth sciences and other markets. 

Approximately 12.9 million shares of Informix common
stock will be issued to acquire all outstanding
shares of Illustra.  An additional 2.1 million
Informix shares will be reserved for issuance in
connection with the assumption of Illustra's
outstanding stock options.  Informix currently has
approximately 135 million shares of stock
outstanding.  The acquisition of Illustra will be
accounted for as a tax free pooling of interest. 

The acquisition will enable Informix to integrate
Illustra's dynamic content management system into its
core parallel database technology, Dynamic Scalable
Architecture (DSA). Informix believes that this
technology integration will give the combined
organisation a significant market advantage over
competing database vendors in providing a powerful
database engine to support the next wave of database
applications - such as Web applications - which
require high-performance and scalability coupled with
dynamic content management capabilities.

Both companies realise that the Web is driving a
large and rapidly-growing new market for information
management.  This new market, which is driving a
shift from static and fixed data types to dynamic and
rich content, requires users to interact with
three-dimensional graphics, video, audio, HTML,
spatial data, and other complex data.  To effectively
manage this new content, users are demanding a
sophisticated database engine that combines the
robust, scalable, enterprise solutions offered by
relational databases with the flexible, extensible,
content management capabilities pioneered by
Illustra.  The integration of Informix and Illustra
products will offer users the ideal solution.

"This acquisition gives Informix a significant lead
over any other database vendor in capturing the
expanding market of content management, especially in
the Web space," said Phil White, chairman and CEO,
Informix.  "In addition to our shared visions and
markets, the synergy with Illustra's technology gives
us a significant time-to-market advantage.  Customers
who had a hard time choosing between the two
companies now have the clear choice for selecting a
database that will take them into the twenty-first
century and beyond." 

"With this agreement, no other database vendor is
better positioned in the Web market and the overall
information management market today," said Dick
Williams, president and CEO, Illustra.  "The
combination of Informix and Illustra technology will
create the database of choice for cyberspace because
it is the ideal coupling of unique strengths."

Industry Comments on Informix/Illustra Announcement
"In looking for an information management solution to
support our Internet products, we surveyed the entire
database market and concluded that Illustra was way
ahead of the pack in terms of understanding and
supporting this emerging class of complex multimedia
data types. We needed an architecture that could be
adapted and extended to include any type of complex
data. both now and in the future.  Illustra was the
only company able to deliver this kind of extensible,
dynamic content management.  With the number of
online users growing 30% per month, we also needed a
high performance, scalable data management solution. 
Informix is the ideal complement to Illustra because
of its proven parallel processing capabilities and
ability to deliver very high performance.  Together,
they are truly the database for cyberspace."

Linda Dozier
Chief Scientist, NaviSoft division
America Online

"The emergence of multimedia and other complex data
types is driving the need for more processing power,
from the home, to the desktop and up through the
enterprise.  With this comes the need for a database
management system that can control all this rich data
and facilitate the development and deployment of
multimedia.  Both companies have been important
partners for us because of their technologies.  We
see Illustra as a primary enabling technology for
this next generation of computing applications. 
Informix has the scalability and parallel processing
features essential for making dynamic multimedia
content ubiquitous, whether its delivered on an
interactive entertainment appliance to the home, or
on a massively parallel computer to the enterprise."

Dave House
Senior Vice President and General Manager,
Enterprise Server Group
Intel

"This announcement is a major step forward for the
industry.  Historically, relational database
companies have done a great job with structured data
but haven't addressed unstructured content.  The
Internet revolution makes handling and manipulating
documents, images, video, and a wide range of other
unstructured media types extremely important.  The
combination of Informix and Illustra shows that
Informix is really stepping up to the plate on
providing state-of-the-art systems for handling
unstructured content to its customers and partners. 
In addition, the Netscape LiveWire Pro visual
environment does a great job of connecting Web
servers to relational databases such as Informix and
Illustra.  Netscape LiveWire Pro, in conjunction with
the Informix/Illustra database technology, will make
storing and manipulating data on the net easier than
ever."

-PSION: PSION HC120 handheld computers used by Thames
Water maintenance engineers

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: PSION HC120
handheld computers used by Thames Water maintenance
engineers, meter readers and water quality staff
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

It's a tough world for the Psion HC120 handheld
computers used by Thames Water's maintenance
engineers, meter readers and water quality staff. 
The HCs have been dropped down manholes, flung from
the roofs of speeding vans and even stolen.  Yet so
far, Thames has not lost any data as a result of
these testing conditions. 

In 1991, Thames carried out a study into the new
systems the business needed to improve efficiency and
quality of services.  It found three areas collecting
water and waste water samples, meter reading, and
scheduling distribution work where portable computers
would help to streamline the process.  The company
talked to as many suppliers of handheld computers it
could find up to 30 and was impressively thorough. 

Psion met the three key criteria.  The first was the
functionality of the HC series.  The second was the
modularity of the Psion approach: applications and
hardware options such as modems, bar code readers and
memory packs could be added easily.  And third was
value for money.   The Psion HC was the only product
we looked at that met all our selection criteria,'
says Dr Mike Hanbury, manager of Business Systems
Division, a group set up within Thames Water's
Management Services Division.

Thames has developed its own software for its field
applications.  In November 1991 it began work on the
Mobile Job Management System, the handheld
counterpart of an application that ruins on an IBM
mainframe.  Essentially, it's a field engineer
management system adapted for the water industry.  It
allocates work, such as checking for leaks and other
possible problems. 
A customer agent at the Thames Customer Centre takes
reports of leaks and other problems of supply, and
raises a job on the mainframe if appropriate.  The
system allocates the job to a network services
technician, (the water board inspector of old).  It
is then downloaded to the technician's HC, either
directly, or from a supervisor's HC in the field. 

The technician completes the job, and enters the
details into the HC, from which they are transferred
to the supervisor's HC.  The supervisor returns to
the depot, and uploads the details to the main
system.  Within 24 hours full details are on the
mainframe, so if the person who reported the. fault
rings again, they can be told what has been done. 
The network services technician also collects
information from data loggers, supplied by Radcom,
which record water flow rates in the mains for
leakage control and similar data. 

Thames intends to transfer the data from the HC to
the mainframe over radio, an approach already used by
other Psion clients such as Bass Leisure Machine
Services for its field engineers.  "The things the
Bass engineers are doing in the field are obviously
totally different, but there isn't much difference in
the approach," says Hanbury. 

Full roll-out of the Mobile Job Management System was
complete by the beginning of this year, with 400
technicians handling more than 4,000 jobs every day. 
Water sample collection, with software once again
written by Hanbury's Field Information Systems team,
went live in October 1993.  Used by water quality
inspectors, this system interfaces with TAPS the
Thames Advanced Pre-scheduling System.  Inspectors
enter details of the sample collection point, time
and date.  Bottles containing the samples are bar
coded, and all internal bar code scanner in the HC is
used to link the bottle to the record.  Eighty of
these are now in use.

70 Thames meter readers began to use HCs on 19 July
1993.  The meter readers work from home, and use the
HC's internal modem to get details from the depot of
next day's 'walk' using their home telephones.  On
the walk itself, they record meter readings and ally
problems.  Once home, they send this data to the
Thames customer information system, where it is
available for billing and analysis.

Thames is now looking at another application, its
Planned Maintenance Services (PMS) system, for
mobile, paperless operation using the Psion HC.  Job
management and planned maintenance are quite similar. 
"If you were there on day one, you would probably
only build one system for both jobs, but they were
taken in as packages, serving different parts of the
business," says Hanbury.  "The PMS looks after fixed
assets such as pumps and other electrical or
mechanical systems."

Mobile planned maintenance will be used by those
servicing one of Thames' most exciting projects, the
London Ring Main.  Longer than the Channel Tunnel and
deeper than London Under-round, this huge main has a
bore of between 100 and 125 inches. The relationship
between Psion and Thames is important to both
companies.  'Bearing in mind that we've now got more
than 600 units out there, it's very important to our
business that we get the working relationship with
them right in terms of support, says Hanbury.  'It's
important that if we have a hardware problem, Psion
will fix it and fix it fast.  But to date, we haven't
had a true hardware fault.

The planned maintenance and job management systems
are good candidates for a mobile geographical
information system, using digitised large scale maps
of streets, mains, hydrants and manholes.  The Psion
HCs have the potential to display maps should Thames
decide to take this approach.

-PSION: Need a new pump sir?  We'll be round in
thirty seconds

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: Need a new pump
sir?  We'll be round in thirty seconds
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

In the fast moving drinks market, having an edge over
the competition is vitally important.  In many cases,
this means investing in the very latest technology. 
But new machines bring their own problems and both
the customer and the consumer have to be convinced of
the benefits.

Landlords or pub managers may find that more and more
of their keg technicians arrive armed with computers
instead of pen and paper.  HP Bulmer Limited were one
of the first to "go techno" equipping their staff
with the top selling Psion handheld range.  And the
customers, initially reticent about the new
technology, became swift converts to the new system
when they saw the benefits it could provide. 

Bulmer's IT Manager, Robin Flower, tells the story of
a moody landlord who phoned the telesales desk of
Bulmer to ask for a Strongbow pump to be fitted in
his pub.  He put the phone down and saw a man
standing at the bar with a hand-held computer.
"Bloody yuppies," the landlord mumbled to himself and
strode forward to serve the computer-toting gent.
`Good afternoon," said the man, "I'm from Bulmer.  I
understand you're looking for a Strongbow pump?"

As the telesales staff had been typing in the details
of the landlord's request, a keg technician 200 yards
up the road from the pub had been accessing the
company's database at the same time from his Psion
handheld computer.  A coincidence?  Yes, but it shows
the customer service benefits computers can bring to
a company. 

Bulmer are the world's largest cider manufacturer and
they hold 45% of the cider market in the UK. 
Strongbow and Woodpecker are the top two cider brands
respectively and are served in some 60,000 pubs,
clubs and bars.  The company's database which holds
all of this information is affectionately known at
Bulmer as the "pub universe".  This database contains
vast quantities of information ranging from a retail
outlet's history right up to plans and profiles for
marketing future products. 

With only 33 keg technicians to manage their 60,000
outlets, the task of scheduling a day's work at
Bulmer was a huge one.  Apart from new installations,
there are maintenance audits to be carried out.  The
sheer size of Bulmer's "pub universe" - they have GBP
33 million worth of equipment in pubs and clubs -
makes it very difficult to manage and there were
instances where some of their equipment hadn't been
seen for over a year!

Bulmers sought a technological solution to the
problem. "We are the No. 1 cider manufacturer in the
world," says Flower.  "We want to stay one step ahead
of the pack to remain No. 1. With the Psion handheld
computer the whole scheduling process has been
simplified and streamlined, and the "pub universe" is
put to much better use." 

Nowadays there is no need for keg technicians to make
costly phone calls to the office to find out their
next jobs.  Using the Psion and a modem, up to three
days work can be scheduled, including suggested ways
to get there.  These more flexible routes not only
start and end as close to the technician's home as
possible, but have allowed the scheduling of spot
audits to check up on the company's "missing"
equipment. 

The benefits of using the "Keg Technician System" are
greater efficiency leading to cost savings.  "With
better journey planning and scheduling, Bulmer's keg
technician's call rate has increased from five to
nine calls daily and as a result, Bulmers can now
provide better customer service," Flower continues. 
Further benefits have been due to more regular audits
in the field helping reduce Bulmer equipment losses
from 10% to 7% per year.

Overall, Bulmer's has saved an estimated GBP 1m so
far on its investment of GBP 250,000 and is expected
to save a potential GBP 3m in total by using the
Psion "Keg Technician System".

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: PSION to exhibit
at Service Management Europe
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Psion PLC, the international manufacturer of portable
computers and datacommunications products, will be
exhibiting at SERVICE MANAGEMENT EUROPE 1996, (stand
121). 

In April 1995, the Workabout product range was
launched for corporate industrial markets. This
product family provides a cost-effective solution for
applications at the lower end of the corporate market
place complementing the HC range and building oil the
success enjoyed for so many years by the Organiser
family in this area.  Initial market reaction to the
Workabout has been positive.  The Organiser 11 family
continued to sell well for a range first brought to
the market in 1986.

The outlook for HC Corporate products is for stronger
growth in 1995-6, with applications for railway
ticketing, field service, transport and inventory
management.  Interim results (for the six months
ended 30th June 1995) showed sales of the HC
Corporate products were ahead at GBP 3.98m (1994 -
GBP 3.60m).

Highlights are as follows:                            
                    1995        1994          CHANGE
                    GBP '000    GBP '000          %
Turnover            39.82       28.28         +41%
Profit before tax    5.15        2.92         +76%
Profit after tax     3.45        1.96         +76%
Earnings per share  14.97p       8.65p        +73%
Dividend per share   1.50p       1.10p        +36%

* International sales up 46% to GBP 18.55m (1994 -
GBP 12.71m)
* Turnover in the US was up 65% at GBP 4.76m (1994
GBP 2.88m)
* Sales in the United Kingdom rose 37% to GBP 21.27m
(1994: GBP 15.57)
* Sales of the Series 3 and 3a were up 48% at GBP
24.74m (1994 GBP 16.73m) 

David Potter, Chairman, said today:
"During the first half, trading was at record levels,
margins improved and significant cash was generated. 
However, stronger growth was constrained by limited
supplies of certain semiconductors.  During the
second half, higher deliveries are promised but there
will also be substantial investment in both marketing
and research and development.  Demand levels are
strong and in August a third high-capacity
surface-mount production line was added at a cost of
GBP 1.1m. The outlook for the rest of the year is
good."

1990s

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: Bass - facing up
to the challenges of the 1990s
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

The humble slot machine has become a permanent
feature in pub entertainment.  BLit behind the bright
lights, whirring reels and endless "nudges" lies a
highly sophisticated business. One of the major
players is Bass Leisure Management Systems (BLMS),
part of the Bass drinks group.  They have 42,000
machines spread across 10,000 sites and every week
400 of their staff count a staggering GBP 3 million
in cash from machines all around the country. 

Traditionally, when the cash was collected, the split
between BLMS and the pubs had to be calculated
manually.  "This process was open to errors as large
as 25 per cent," said Mike England, Computer Services
Manager at BLMS.  "We felt the answer was to automate
the collection system." BLMS examined some of the
finest high tech solutions available and chose the
Psion HC.

At the user end, the BLMS system consists of a small
hand-held terminal - no bigger than a calculator with
an in-built modem - and a till-roll printer with a
specially designed case. Information about the
machines to be visited and the terms and conditions
which apply to them is downloaded each night to a PC
at the BLMS depot.  The collectors then transfer this
information onto their Psion terminals either
directly from the PC or via the telephone. Collected
information is then up-loaded to the computer in the
same way. 

The immediate benefit was to the collectors. 
Chrissie Holt, the first collector to use tile system
said: "Psion have made our jobs so much easier. 
Everything we do now is self- explanatory.  We can
now do more work, cover more machines and it is much
easier to get things right first time!"

The biggest benefit to BLMS is cost savings with the
initial investment being recouped within two years
but other pluses have emerged also.  Psion terminals
provide managers with important information on
efficiency and we are able to identify problems early
and take appropriate action, for example, by
providing further training." 

The full benefits for BLMS are yet to come.  As well
as speeding up the process, it will produce cost
savings of GBP 80,000 a year on stationery alone.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: New look innovation and
technology transfer news letter

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: New
look innovation and technology transfer news letter
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

The Innovation and Technology Transfer newsletter
published by the European Commission has been
relaunched.  The newsletter, which aims among other
things to help disseminate R&D information more
widely amongst potential users, now has separate
editions for English, French and German speaking
readers.  It presents its vast range of information
in a bright, accessible format that should open new
areas of interest to every reader.

Innovation and Technology Transfer is published six
times a year by the European Commission's Innovation
Programme, which aims to strengthen Europe's
innovation infrastructure and disseminate research
results to industry.  The emphasis is on providing
timely news relevant to these objectives and in-depth
case studies about successful projects.  This enables
readers to gain an insight into topics that directly
reflect their own concerns and requirements.

Readers who are not involved with the Innovation
Programme's work are given a chance to see how
successful and potentially useful that work can be;
those who are already benefiting from the initiatives
can gain from the cross-fertilisation of ideas and
results that characterises the nature of the
programme.  Innovation and Technology Transfer offers
subjects as diverse as 'cleaner magnesium
production', 'designing energy efficient offices' and
'planning for the future in IT'.  Some topics are
weighted towards industrialists and some towards the
research laboratory.  In all, it is a broad, lively
view of the wealth of EU research and technological
development activities, with the accent on
exploitation of these activities' results. 

The newsletter also publishes more general
information that is relevant to the Innovation
programme.  The Policy News section discusses new
initiatives and legislation.  The articles here bring
out the impact of policy changes across the EU; they
also provide a forum in which new programmes can be
announced. Innovation Programme News covers the
latest news from this programme, including details of
new measures to promote an 'innovation-friendly'
environment in Europe, and publications and
information services to assist with technology
transfer, as well as news on funding possibilities
offered by the programme. 

Summaries of important new publications and
announcements of conferences take up the final part
of each issue of the newsletter.  Availability
details are given for the publications and sources
for obtaining more information given for the
conferences. In fact. a feature of Innovation and
Technology Transfer is that throughout the newsletter
contact points are cited at the end of each article,
so that readers can easily see how to obtain further
information.  With the accessibility offered by
Innovation and Technology Transfer there is no excuse
for readers not to participate fully in the disparate
fields which come under the Innovation Programme
umbrella.

acronyms

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  A
guiding hand through EU acronyms
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

A new publication from the European Commission offers
help to those whose interest in European Union
research is sometimes hindered by the use of
acronyms.  An increasing part of research and
development vocabulary, the use of acronyms helps
reduce long-winded terminology and enables complex
ideas to be contained in simple phrases.  However,
where acronyms come together in large numbers, the
aim of offering simplicity is often overturned and
the meaning of the information can become confused.

'European Union R&D Acronyms' is a single desktop
reference tool for those wanting to know more about
EU RTD activities.  It is a facet of the EU's
commitment to spreading the message about its
research activities and opening up information to an
ever-increasing target audience.  The intention is to
ensure that as many people as possible have access to
the core information about EU research, to encourage
exploitation of results and participation in current
programmes. 

Within the dictionary the 4,900 entries are explained
in alphabetical order.  The entry for each acronym
also identifies the originating body and the general
programme area to which the acronym belongs.  This
extra information helps set the acronym in context
and provides a clearer idea of the background to the
project or programme to which the acronym refers. 
Users can not only establish the meaning of an
acronym but can ascertain the wider context implied
by its use. 

The dictionary is based on the information held in
one of the databases of CORDIS, the Community
Research and Development Information Service which is
operated under the European Union's Innovation
Programme.  It also serves as a means to alert
potential users to CORDIS and the other information
products offered by this service.  For existing users
of CORDIS the dictionary also offers a concise
explanation of the various subject codes found in the
databases and can thus be used as part of the query
forming process when interrogating CORDIS. Absolute
newcomers to EU RTD are recommended to register with
CORDIS for a more complete and current information
resource, although the content of 'European Union R&D
Acronyms' has a potential value for everyone
interested in this area of activity.

'European Union R&D Acronyms' is published by the

-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION: Viewing of cable
channels on the increase

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION
COMMISSION: Viewing of cable channels on the increase
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

Cable and satellite channels have regained some of
the audience share lost in 1994, according to the
ITC's most recent survey of viewing in broadband
cable homes.  The share of viewing taken by cable and
satellite channels increased between October 1994 and
October 1995 from 34.9% to 39.6%, while BBC1's share
fell from 24.3% in 1994 to 21.2% in 1995.  Viewing
shares remained fairly constant for ITV and BBC2 over
the two years but Channel 4's share also fell by one
percentage point.

Sky One remained overall the most popular cable
channel, with a share of 4.8% although this share has
fallen from 6.6% recorded in 1994 and 9.6% in 1993. 
Indeed, in the league table of audience shares (table
1) Sky One dropped to third cable place for the first
time behind the Movie Channel (5.8%) and Sky Movies
(5.2%) within homes receiving these channels.

1995 has been a successful year for cable and
satellite channels targeted at the child audience. 
Children's viewing of cable and satellite channels as
a whole accounts for over half of their total viewing
(54.4% of 2 to 15 year olds viewing in October 1995
compared to 47.3% in October 1994).  The preference
for the "new" channels is even more pronounced
amongst the younger age groups with viewing of cable
and satellite channels accounting for 63.9% of
viewing amongst 2 to 9 year olds.  Most notably, the
viewing share for the Cartoon Network has risen
across all individuals from 2.0% in 1994 to 4.5% in
1995.

Amongst 2 to 9 year olds this share reaches 30.5%.
The recently launched Disney Channel accounts for
1.8% of total viewing rising to 6.2% of all
children's viewing (2 to 15 year olds), and 10.1% of
the younger age group (2 to 9 year olds).  The
Children's Channel, one of the longest running cable
and satellite channels. now re-launched as TCC, also
fared well in 1995.  Viewing shares amongst all
individuals doubled (from a 0.6% share in 1994 to a
1.3% share in 1995), while amongst children (2 to 15
year olds) this share rose to 5.1% of all viewing.

Other key results from the study are:
* The proportion of viewers with 2 or more decoders,
giving television sets in different rooms access to
the range of cable channels, increased from 28.4% in
1994 to 34.8% in 1995.  This benefits the more
specialised channels which may appeal to individual
members of the family.  Thematic channels such as the
Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and The Cartoon
Network, achieved greater audience shares in homes
with multiple set connections.  This increased both
the total amount of viewing in those homes, by 2.8
hours a week per viewer, and the cable and satellite
share, which rose to 41.9% compared to 38.3% in
single connection homes.

* Viewers in higher socioeconomic groups continue to
remain lighter viewers of cable and satellite
channels although this characteristic has become less
pronounced (a 33.2% share amongst AB viewers in 1995,
compared with a 24.1% share in 1994).  Cable and
satellite channels disproportionately favoured by AB
viewers in 1995 were Sky One, Sky Sports and
Nickelodeon.

* The socio-economic difference in viewing patterns
has become less marked over the years.  The heavy
skew towards DE viewing of cable and satellite
channels has declined from 54.1% in 1993 to 34.7% in
1994 and 38.1% in 1995 compared to an overall average
viewing of 39.6% in 1995.  DE viewers watched
proportionally more of Sky Movies, The Movie Channel,
UK Gold, The Cartoon Network and The Disney Channel.

* The amount of self-reported time spent viewing
television in broadband homes overall has decreased
slightly to an average of 25.13 hours per week in
1995, compared to 25.32 in 1994.  Amongst children
this tendency has been dramatically reversed with
overall viewing amongst 2 to 15 year olds increasing
from 19.95 hours in 1994 to 22.47 hours in 1995. 
This is largely accounted for by increased viewing of
child-friendly channels such as The Cartoon Network,
The Disney Channel and TCC, together with the
continued appeal of Nickelodeon.

* The level of expressed satisfaction with cable
television services remains very high overall,
although slightly lower than in 1994 (86.4% said they
were very or quite satisfied/pleased with the
services in 1995, compared with 87.2% in 1994). 
Satisfaction is higher amongst viewers in homes
subscribing to premium channels, with 92.3% of
respondents in homes receiving all three Sky Movie
Channels plus Disney stating that they were very
(32.1%) or quite (60.2%) pleased with the service.

Technical Notes
The ITC's study was undertaken by Continental
Research over a two week period in October.  It was
based on a total of 1,306 one- week diaries derived
from 653 respondents aged 2 years old and over
representative of broadband cable viewers in 39 cable
franchises in different parts of the country.  The
diaries covered the two weeks from Monday 16 October
to Sunday 29 October 1995.

This is the latest in a series of similar studies,
conducted by Continental Research for the Cable
Authority in 1990 and for the ITC in 1991, 1992, 1993
and 1994.  The ITC plans to publish a review of these
studies early in 1996.

Tables giving more detailed information are attached. 
Copies of the full report are available from
Continental Research priced GBP 150.00.

-WARRANTECH: Warrantech moves into UK

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-WARRANTECH: Warrantech
moves into UK
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020196

Warrantech Corporation, the rapidly-expanding
provider of extended guarantees, service contracts
and database management services which has operations
in the USA, Canada, Mexico and Japan, has opened a
European headquarters in Marylebone Road, London. 

The move follows the acquisition by Warrantech of
Southwark-based Home Guarantee Corporation Pie and
the formation of Warrantech Europe Plc, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Warrantech Corporation. 
Home Guarantee Corporation plc provides UK homebuyers
and sellers with a range of extended warranty
products through members of The National Association
of Estate Agents (NAEA). 

In addition to Home Guarantee Corporation, Warrantech
Europe will comprise four other UK divisions -
Warrantech Automotive, Warrantech Consumer Product
Services, Warrantech Creditor and Warrantech Training
and Motivation.

From their Grove House headquarters in Marylebone
Road, the divisions will provide extended warranty
products on a wide range of equipment including cars,
business equipment, office and home computers, mobile
telephones, and major domestic appliances. 
Warrantech Europe will also provide a full database
management, marketing and customer care service for
clients in the automotive, financial, manufacturing,
retail and service sectors.

Major UK clients already include the NAEA, Office
World and the Hartwell Motor Group and the company is
currently in negotiation to provide extended
warranties and other marketing services to a number
of major UK and Continental companies.

One of the leading publicly-quoted warranty companies
in the U.S. (NASDAQ symbol: WTEC), Warrantech
Corporation is an associate company of American
International Group, one of the world's largest
insurance companies with global assets of more than
$100 billion.

Warrantech Corporation Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Joel San Antonio said the decision to
establish Warrantech Europe with a headquarters in
London was part of the Corporation's stated objective
to become the global leader in the provision of
innovative marketing and administrative services for
business. 

He said:
"We see the UK and the Continent as the next logical
step in our expansion programme.  As consumers become
more demanding about the products and services they
purchase, our range of extended warranty products
will give greater financial security to customers,
particularly on items such as homes, consumer
electronics and computers."

Donald Alcorn, Managing Director of Home Guarantee
Corporation, has been appointed Managing Director of
Warrantech Europe.  Mr Alcorn, who has worked in the
UK insurance industry for 30 years, said:
"Warrantech Europe is committed to providing
manufacturers., retailers and service providers with
a range of marketing and administrative services
which will enhance the value of the products they
provide to their customers." 

During the year ended March 31, 1995, Warrantech
Corporation increased gross revenues from nearly $47
million to over $71 million, whilst in the six months
to September 30, 1995, net revenues were a record
$43.41 million - a 40 per cent increase on the same
period last year.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Background report -- Small
businesses in the European Union

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:
Background report -- Small businesses in the European
Union
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

INTRODUCTION
Small businesses account for a major share of the GDP
and employment of the Community and thus make a
significant contribution to its economy.  The
Community has long recognised their importance for
creating employment and stimulating growth.  Indeed,
the Treaty on European Union makes a specific
commitment to "encouraging an environment favourable
to initiative and to the development of undertakings
throughout the Community, particularly small and
medium-sized undertakings". 

The best way for the Community to stimulate
entrepreneurs and businesses is by improving and
simplifying the environment in which they operate. 
They need an environment which a@lows them to be
competitive in world markets, particularly vis a vis
the US, Japan and the fast-emerging economies of the
Far East. 

The Commission has drawn up a report' which gives a
comprehensive view of the measures taken at EU level
to improve the business environment and to support
the development of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).  The report also looks at collaboration with
the Member States, professional organisations and
other European institutions.

IMPROVING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
A recent study from the European Observatory for SMEs
has estimated that the total annual costs of
administrative burdens for business in Europe were
between 180-230 billion ECUs, the equivalent of 3-4%
of EU GDR There is therefore a serious economic cost
which needs to be reduced. 

Assessing the impact of legislation on small business
The role of DG XXIII at the Commission, which is in
charge of enterprise policy, is to ensure that the
Commission is taking appropriate account of the
impact on enterprises, and in particular small
businesses, of any legislative proposals.  Account
must be taken not only of the compliance costs and
other burdens of a regulation but also the
administrative procedures or requirements which stem
from it.! Where appropriate, a business impact
assessment is undertaken which involves full
consultation and the setting out of often conflicting
interests of different business sectors.

The fiscal environment
The Commission has identified three priority problems
for small businesses as far as their fiscal position
is concerned: their capacity to attract adequate
financial resources, their capacity to respond to
administrative complexity and finally the problem of
change of proprietor.  A Recommendation on the
taxation of SMEs aims to ensure greater equity in the
fiscal treatment of retained or reinvested profits
between sole traders, partnerships and limited
companies and to lift the fiscal obstacles in the
transformation from sole trader or partnership to
limited company.  The Commission has also been
working on the transfer of ownership of SMEs. 

The financial environment
Amongst the initiatives to improve the financial
environment, a Round Table of bankers and small
businesses has been set up to improve small business
access to finance.  A Recommendation on payment terms
for commercial transactions aims to combat delays in
payment and a Directive has been proposed on
cross-border payments.  Directives on insurance have
been adopted which simplify the conditions of access
to insurance markets as well as the operating
conditions.  Two new financial instruments have been
put in place: subsidised loans for job-creating SMEs
and the European Investment Fund, (see below). 

The Internal Market
Efforts to improve the business environment are also
under way in other policy areas.  In general, the
Internal Market is seen as having a positive effect
on the business environments of small business.  It
is seen as providing a stimulus to overall demand and
business development and allowing for a reduction in
average production costs as a result of mark-et
expansion.  On the other hand, it has led to keener
competition and greater pressure on costs and price
as factors in competitiveness.  It may lead to a
certain, amount of restructuring in the short-run
while the positive effects materialise in the medium
to longer-term. 

Competition
SMEs have been freed from unnecessary administrative
burdens with exemptions and special regulations in
competition policy.  As far as state aid is
concerned, the Commission's traditionally favourable
attitude to state aid for SMEs was formalised by the
adoption in 1992 of a specific framework, to be
reexamined in 1995.  This framework provides Member
States with the option of granting aid, within
certain set limits, designed to encourage investment
by SMEs and to encourage them to improve their
competence through advice and information.  Member
States are dispensed from notifying the Commission of
very small sums of aid which it considers to have a
negligible impact on trade between Member States and
on competition. 

Energy policy
The Union's energy policy has a direct effect on the
development and Operation of SMEs since its
objectives are to meet the needs of individual and
industrial users at less cost and under circumstances
which ensure security of supply and environmental
protection.  The availability of energy at best
prices and on the best terms is a determining factor
in strengthening the overall competitiveness of the
economy and of SMEs in particular. 

Environmental policy
In November 1994, the Commission presented a
Communication on Economic Growth and the Environment
which underlines the need for market-based
instruments in the area of environmental policies,
such as eco- labelling, tax rebates for green
investments etc.  The idea is for companies to be
able to integrate environmental considerations in
their policies in a more flexible way.

PROGRAMMES AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A large part of Community support comes through
financial instruments, in particular the Structural
Funds, as well as Community programmes, such as the
research and vocational training programmes. 

Financial instruments
The European Investment Bank (EIB)
The EIB finances large-scale investments through
individual loans and modest investments, in
particular those of small businesses, indirectly
through its global loans.  Those global loans are
concluded with financial intermediaries operating at
the national, regional or even local level.  This
puts the EIB in a position to support smaller
investments which it would not be able to finance by
individual loans, for reasons of management
efficiency.  The field of application of global loans
has been progressively increased in order to adapt to
the development of needs and the diversification of
Community policies.  They usually concern investments
of small businesses in industry, services (notably
tourism and agriculture) and small-scale
infrastructure projects contributing to Community
objectives in the areas of regional development,
environmental protection, energy or transport.

In 1994 the EIB concluded global loans totalling ECU
3.281 million and credits on current global loans
amounted to ECU 2.763 million. 60% of this amount was
devoted to supporting SMEs, 90% of which employed
less than 50 people.  Since 1990 the EIB has provided
significant support to the financing of SMEs.  Nearly
36,000 have benefited from credits in a total of over
ECU 9.4 billion.  Over 80% of them are enterprises
employing less than 50 people and 90% less than 250
people. 

The EIB will now not only accelerate the financing of
infrastructure but it will also help job-creating
SMEs. 

The SME facility: subsidised loans for job-creating
SMEs
A mechanism for interest subsidies relating to ECU 1
billion in global EIB loans in favour of small
businesses was approved in April 1994 by the Council
of Ministers.  The interest subsidy of 2% per year is
applied for five years on a maximum loan amount of
ECU 30,000 per job created.  The SME facility should
allow 30,000 jobs to be created.  The mechanism was
implemented in September 1994 and by the end of April
1995, 48% had been allocated to some 2,100 businesses
and more than 23,000 new jobs are planned. 96% of the
volume of loans was granted to SMEs with less than
250 employees.

The European Investment Fund: loan guarantees for
SMEs
At the Edinburgh Council in 1992, it was decided to
create a European Investment Fund (EIF) aimed at
granting loan guarantees for projects relating to
trans-European networks! and for small business.  The
EIF concentrates its attention on those areas where
it can be complementary to existing sources of
finance.  It offers two main types of financial
products, financial guarantees and equity.  The
initial ceiling on the overall commitments of the
Fund has been set at 3 times its subscribed capital
but this may be raised at a later stage once adequate
reserves have been established.  The Fund will work
through appropriate financial intermediaries in the
Member States rather than providing direct guarantees
to individual SMEs. 

Structural Funds
Regional initiatives
On average 10% of the total resources of the European
Regional Development Fund are devoted specifically to
measures dealing with the promotion and improvement
of the economic environment of SMEs.  Funds go to
encouraging demand for services from small businesses
as well as to the supply of services to them. 

A so-called SME Community initiative, allocated ECU 1
billion for 1994-99, aims to contribute to the
internationalisation of small businesses and to
promote improvements in their competitiveness. 

Seven priority areas have been identified:
improvement of production and organisation systems;
environment and rational use of energy; cooperation
with research centres; access to new markets;
cooperation networks; strengthening vocational
qualifications and improved access to the financial
system. 

Twelve other Community initiatives also contribute to
the development of small businesses.  Amongst these
are REGIS which is concerned with the most peripheral
regions of the EU, RETEX which is designed to assist
enterprises in the textiles sector, URBAN which
targets urban areas and ADAPT which helps the labour
force to respond to the changing needs of the labour
market.

Other innovative forms of Community support include
global development subsidies.  These were introduced
in 1988 and are granted to an intermediary body for
carrying out a territorial development strategy which
it negotiates with the Commission and implements
under its own responsibility.  Between 1988-1993, 31
agreements were established for a total combined
amount of ECU 687 million. 

Social funding
Recognising that small businesses are a major source
of new employment, the Commission aims to encourage
entrepreneurial activity to stimulate the creation of
more SMEs.  The European Social Fund (ESF) has three
priorities: to improve education and initial
training; to increase competitiveness and prevent
unemployment by adapting the workforce to change with
continuing training; and to improve the employment
opportunities of the long-term unemployed.

The promotion of a more systematic approach to
continued training is planned to involve about ECU 6
billion during 1994-1999, or some 14% of total Social
Fund allocations. 

Other funds
Small businesses benefit from other Funds, such as
the Agricultural Funds and they are principal
beneficiaries of Community structural interventions
in favour of fisheries. 

Research and technological development (RTD)
Increased efforts are being made to facilitate the
participation of SMEs in Community research
programmes. Under the 3rd Framework Programme
(1990-94) a total of 6368 small businesses
participated in RTD programmes with a budgetary
commitment of ECU 1035 million or 22% of the total
Community financial commitment.

Within the Brite-Euram Programme (Industrial and
Materials Technologies) the Commission introduced two
schemes specifically for small businesses: the
feasibility awards which are aimed at SMEs with RTD
capacity who wish to play a major role in a large
multi-partner project and CRAFT which targets those
with little or no RTD means, enabling them to engage
third parties to carry out RTD work on their behalf.
80% of SMEs taking part in CRAFT are total newcomers
to EU RTD and 50% have no previous RTD cooperation
experience at all. 

About 920 separate SMEs participated in the
Information Technology programme ESPRIT III, with a
bud-et of ECU 1532 million for the period 1991-94. 
They carry out about 31% of the total of the relevant
work of the programme, up from 21% during the
previous programme.  In the next programme, running
from 1994-98, participation of SMEs will be further
encouraged.

The VALUE programme is aimed at promoting the spread
and effective use of results of scientific and
technological research in order to strengthen the
competitiveness of European industry.  SMEs have been
involved in 69% of the projects as contractor, 39% as
partner and 38% as participant. 

Under the fourth Framework Programme special budgets
have been allocated within the different programmes
for specific SME measures totalling over ECU 700
million, or 9% of the total budget of these
programmes.  In addition, SMEs will participate in
other actions within the mainstream research
programmes. 

SPRINT aims to stimulate innovation and technology
transfer, particularly in small businesses. 
Altogether 162,600 SMEs have benefited from the
SPRINT programme, either by purchasing, testing or
keeping informed of the new technologies.

EUROTECH CAPITAL is an initiative to encourage the
financing by private capital of high technology
transnational projects.  In 1994 the Eurotech capital
network comprised 13 members, covering the majority
of Member States, who had undertaken to invest a
total of ECU 202 million. 

From 1974-1989 half of the projects under the THERMIE
energy programme involved SMEs in a total of 2450
projects representing ECU 1.2 billion of financial
support.  The THERMIE programme for 1995-1998 gives
financial support to projects implementing innovative
energy technologies and to a whole series of
complementary activities including technological
stimulation of SMEs. 

While more than half the funds from the EURET
programme, which supports research in transport, has
gone to large enterprises, SMEs come second among
beneficiaries with 19% of the budget and 25% of the
number of participants.

Vocational training
In addition to the resources from the European Social
Fund (some ECU 20 billion for the period 1989-1993),
there are a number of programmes aimed at raising the
level of qualifications throughout the Community,
such as EUROTECNET, COMETT, FORCE and PETRA.  These
programmes were completed at the end of 1994 and
replaced by the LEONARDO programme which will run
from 1995-99. 

The EUROTECNET programme aimed to promote innovation
in vocational training resulting from technological
change and 18% of projects from 1990-94 targeted
SMEs.

The COMETT programme encouraged intra-Community
cooperation between university and business in the
field of technologies, particularly advanced
technologies.  About 75% of enterprises involved as
partners in one or more COMETT projects were small
businesses and 80% included at least one small
business.  Alto-ether it is estimated that 40,000
SMEs will have benefited directly from COMETT II
(1990-94), including at least 15,000 which have
received students on placements from different
countries.  As far as continuing training is
concerned, it is estimated that 200,000 small
business employees have taken a training course or
are using training materials. Furthermore, over 1000
SME intermediary organisations, such as chambers of
commerce or trade associations have participated in
the COMETT partnerships with a multiplier effect on
small businesses. 

FORCE had the objective of encouraging enterprises,
particularly small ones, to invest in continuing
vocational training.  Between 1991-93 2,250 small
businesses or groups of small businesses participated
in this programme as partners in more than two thirds
of the projects, directly or indirectly. 

The LEONARDO programme (1995-99) takes up three main
types of trans-national cooperation measures of the
earlier programmes: pilot cooperation projects,
exchange programmes and surveys and analysis.  It
includes an important innovation in that all measures
should have a trans-national character and a stronger
accent is put on disseminating and analysing the
results.

Environmental programmes
Out of 99 projects co-financed in 1993 under the LIFE
financial instrument for the environment, it is
estimated that 43 involved small businesses,
receiving 38% of the total granted. 

A number of actions have been pursued to help inform
small businesses about improving health and safety. 
The Commission has drawn up a document on risk
assessment in the workplace with one part
particularly devoted to small businesses.  A
self-audit method for health and safety at work has
been prepared to help heads of SMEs to do their
assessments.  A conference entitled "Taking risks and
working safely" was principally geared towards small
businesses and the European Agency for Health and
Safety at Work, which should come into operation in
1995, will pay particular attention to the special
problems of SMEs.  A proposed programme called SAFE
(Safety Action for Europe) will support projects to
promote improvements in safety, hygiene and health at
work, to improve work practice and to influence
attitudes in order to reduce accidents and
occupational diseases. 

The information market
The IMPACT programme(1991-95), targeting the single
market for information services, has undertaken
several actions in favour of small businesses.  In
1994 it implemented over 700 actions on awareness and
promotion of electronic information services.  Small
businesses need advanced methods of access to and
processing of information to become and remain
competitive.  Also the productive industry of
electronic information services is itself largely
composed of small businesses.

Out of the 160 contracts under the TEDIS programme
(Trade Electronic Data Interchange Systems) half of
the prime contractors are SMEs.  TEDIS promotes
electronic data interchange (EDI) standards and has
developed a network of 40 centres in various European
regions to stimulate the knowledge and use of EDI to
help small businesses.  TEDIS is also active in
several international cooperative ventures. 

Providing information for business
The network of Euro-Info Centres (EICs) provides
information for businesses in their region on the
various Community programmes and policies.  EICs have
played an important role in providing information on
public tenders and on research and technology
programmes.  The information and advice mission of
EICs puts them in a special position to understand
the actual problems encountered by SMEs in
implementing legislation or in participating in
certain programmes.  The Commission therefore
consults them directly or asks them to carry out
specific studies based on questionnaires circulated
to the SMEs in their region. Promoting business
cooperation and partnership

The Business Cooperation Network (BC-NET) was
established to encourage an awareness of increasing
business opportunities across Europe.  Its primary
task is to help identify other business partners. 
Other initiatives to promote business cooperation and
partnership include the Business Communication Centre
(BCC) and the Europartenariat and Interprise
programmes.  Europartenariat establishes contacts
between SMEs in different regions of the Community so
that they can conclude technical, commercial and
financial agreements. 

The European Enterprise and Innovation Centres
(EEICs), launched in 1984, are public/private
partnership structures which identify and select
entrepreneurs and projects which offer the most
complete range of services to enterprise and
accompany the firm during the start-up period.  There
are 70 fully operational EEICs throughout the EU
which have contributed to the creation of more than
2,800 businesses representing 16,000 direct jobs.

Pilot schemes
A number of pilot schemes are being undertaken by the
Commission in areas such as access to research and
technological development, access to public
contracts, standardisation and certification,
commerce and distribution and the craft sector and
small businesses.  The Commission will be supporting
the creation of 7 cross-border offices to help the
craft sector and small businesses develop
cross-border activities and overcome existing
barriers.

Following an audit of 842 small businesses, a report
produced by AFNOR (Association Francaise pour
normalisation) showed that the principles of the
single market and standardisation are generally very
poorly understood because of difficulties getting
access to information and because of the low
participation rate of SMEs in the work on European,
or even national, standards.  Small businesses have
difficulty formalising their quality procedures and
often make over-complex interpretation$ of standards
and set up cumbersome and expensive systems.  As
regards certification, there is still much work to be
done in completing the single market, in particular
on mutual recognition.  SMEs are often unfamiliar
with EC markings and see the cost of obtaining
certificates as a problem.

The Commission launched a pilot scheme in 1989 to
stimulate the creation of start-up capital funds.  It
has supported the establishment of 23 start-up funds
whose aim is to make capital available to firms which
are in the embryonic stage of existence and which
have great difficulty obtaining this on the market. 

Another pilot programme, Commerce 2000, aims to
encourage cooperation between small businesses by
establishing modern methods of management and new
technologies. 52 feasibility study projects and 6
pilot projects were selected in 1994, the results of
which should become available in the course of 1995. 

The Community has a multi-annual programme of work
for cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and
foundations in the EU.  The programme provides a
formal framework for EU action and aims to preserve
diversity in the sector, to encourage solidarity and
to help cooperative enterprises to respond to
economic development and social progress.

With a view to improving the available statistical
information, Eurostat, the EU's statistical off ice,
in conjunction with national offices, has begun to
collect all the financial information available on
enterprises in order to highlight the importance of
small business for production and employment.  In
conjunction with DG XXIII, Eurostat has published at
regular intervals its report "Enterprises in Europe"
which contains detailed information by sector of
economic activity and by payroll size on all the
enterprises in the EU. 

International cooperation
Programmes have been set up to stimulate and support
cooperation between enterprises in the EU and those
in EFTA countries, Central and Eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union and Georgia, Asia, Latin America
and the Mediterranean.

In the context of the PHARE programme, the Commission
has supported the development of SMEs by providing
technical assistance in many countries.  Between
1990-93 the EU made a contribution of ECU 320 million
to countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

Within the framework of TACIS, which fosters links
between the EU and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) and Mongolia, ECU 19 million has been
allocated to support small businesses in 1992, ECU 20
million in 1993 and ECU 12 million in 1994, a total
of ECU 51 Million.  The programme has been based on
the need to build up intermediary agencies to provide
assistance to existing entrepreneurs and those who
wish to set up businesses.

MEDINVEST is a programme to support the development
of small businesses in Mediterranean countries and
has a budget of ECU 12.2 million for 1993-95. 
ALINVEST, with a budget of ECU 18.5 million, aims to
facilitate commercial exchanges, technology and
know-how transfer and financing to the mutual benefit
of Latin American and European enterprises.

The ECIP (European Communities Investment Partners)
is a financial instrument for the developing
countries of Latin America, Asia and the
Mediterranean which facilitates the creation of joint
enterprises.  The orientation of the ECIP scheme is
towards SMEs.

Initiatives to develop contacts between SMEs are also
underway with China and Japan.  Given the importance
of the private sector for the development of African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, the Fourth Lome
Convention provides for a vast range of instruments
which can be used to support SMEs in those countries. 
A large part of these programmes are also of direct
or indirect interest to European SMEs. 

COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATION
Consultation with business organisations
The Commission regularly consults and informs
associations representative of small businesses, the
craft sector and commerce at the European level on
Community activities specifically directed towards
them as well as on all subjects that may concern
them, like the Structural Funds, RTD programmes and
legislative proposals.  In return, these
organisations inform the Commission of their opinion
and a good partnership is established which allows
the viewpoints of business to be taken into account. 
In the commerce and distribution sector the
Commission systematically consults the Committee on
Commerce and Distribution, which was created in 198
1. 

Social dialogue
The Agreement on Social Policy which forms part of
the Maastricht Treaty requires new procedures for
consultation with the social partners as well as
conditions by which these collective agreements are
concluded. The list of social partner organisations
includes the European Association of Crafts, Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), amongst
others.  The Commission has been in contact during
1994 with numerous organisations expressing
particular interest in SMEs, both at the
inter-professional level and at the sectoral level. 

The commerce and distribution sector, over 90% of
which is mad up of enterprises with less than 10
people, is represented by EUROCOMMERCE.  The
Commission has also enlarged its consultation to take
into account the needs of SMEs in the implementation
of the Structural Funds. 

Partnership with Member States
By mutual consultation and cooperation between the
Member States and between the Member States and the
Commission it is hoped that actions can be targeted
at SMEs so that their potential for growth and
employment can be better mobilised.

Collaboration with the other institutions
The European Parliament has emphasised that the
Integrated Programme in favour of SMEs and the Craft
Sector' is the result of the good collaboration that
it maintains with the Commission and that there is
now a global commitment and a strategy towards small
businesses.  It has also created an
Inter-Parliamentary Group on commerce and
distribution.

The Economic and Social Committee proposes carrying
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of existing
measures and an institutional strengthening,
according the political weight necessary to implement
Community policy in favour of SMEs.

The Committee of the Regions emphasises the
importance of coordination between the Community
programmes so as to facilitate access for SMEs and
the craft sector to research and training programmes. 
This is to be achieved by information, a
simplification of procedures, greater participation
of SME representative organisations and a
decentralisation of measures to the regional or local
level. 

Conclusion: In its report the Commission has
attempted to present the links and coordination
between the actions carried out under various Union
policies.  The coordination of Community activities
implies several levels: first within the Commission
services; then with the Member States and the other
European institutions; and then with business
circles.

The Commission will monitor the implementation of
programmes so that the declared objectives of greater
support for SMEs are effectively transformed into
concrete advantages for them.  The Commission intends
to ensure good cooperation with the other
institutions of the Union.  However, given that SME
policy is principally the business of national or
regional authorities, the role of the Commission in
coordinating the policies of the Member States is
limited to stimulating or orchestrating mutual
consultation and cooperation between them and with
the Commission with a view to ensuring more
effectiveness and a certain convergence of actions. 

Effectiveness of measures also implies good
coordination and a permanent dialogue with SME
representative organisations.

The Commission will reinforce coordination with all
its partners, the Member States, the European
institutions and the business organisations so that
the efforts of the Union in favour of small
businesses are converted into growth, competitiveness
and employment.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Background report -- EU
relations with the Baltic States

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:
Background report -- EU relations with the Baltic
States
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Introduction
The Baltic region, as well as being a major
commercial gateway to Russia, is a growing economic
zone in its own right.  A vigorous and open Baltic
Sea(1) economy will Provide new trading and
investment opportunities.  The political, economic
and security interests of the EU and the region will
be served by the fullest integration of the region
into the European and world economy.  To this end, EU
relations with Scandinavia have progressed with the
recent inclusion of Sweden and Finland as members of
the Union and relations with the three Baltic States
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continue to expand. 

EU relations with the Baltic States have progressed
significantly over the last two years.  Relations now
cover much more than simply trade agreements in
certain sectors.  The European Union has recognised
the wish of the Baltic States to become part of the
Union when the necessary preconditions for membership
are fulfilled.  To this end, the European Union has
signed Europe Agreements with all three Baltic
States.  As a consequence, the Baltic States now take
part in the pre-accession strategy in preparation for
eventual accession to the Union.  Latvia and Estonia
have already applied for membership of the European
Union(2).  The pre-accession strategy covers such
divers fields as Home and Justice Affairs, Foreign
and Security policy, political dialogue, internal
market and trade. 

Against all precedent, the future accession of the
Baltic States to the European Union will in many ways
not be as easy as the accession of any of the current
Member States.  Before accession, the new Member
States(3) already had enough expertise in specific
areas, for example law, to meet the requirement for
membership.  The application of the new legislation
and policies will be the most difficult thing for the
Baltic States.  Without detailed assistance from the
EU, the entire process threatens to take much longer
than necessary.  As a precondition to accession,
therefore, the EU underlines the importance for the
European Union to provide assistance in order to
enable these countries to establish the necessary
structures, introduce measures for implementation and
lay out an optimal set of policy and economic
incentives for economic operators(4).

Background
The Baltic States joined the Central and Eastern
European Countries (CEEC) strategy in 1992.  European
Union relations with the Baltic States, therefore,
falls under the Central and Eastern Europe pre-
accession strategy, under which many of the measures
are applicable to all CEE countries, including the
Baltic States.

The Agreements on trade and commercial and economic
co-operation concluded in 1992 with Latvia and
Lithuania entered into force on 1 February 1993.  The
Agreement with Estonia entered into force on 1 March
1993.  These agreements cover trade in certain
sectors.  The trade arrangements were supplemented by
framework agreements.  Annual arrangements for
fisheries Protocols and on trade in textile products
were also signed with Latvia and Lithuania. 

At the request of the Copenhagen European Council,
the Commission asked the Council for authorisation to
negotiate with the Baltic States to convert the
agreements on trade, commercial and economic
co-operation into Free Trade Agreements, with the aim
of concluding Europe Agreements when possible.  The
Free Trade Agreements would fit in with the
enlargement negotiations and would preserve
compatibility between Community acquis (established
Community law and practice) and the existing
agreements between the Nordic countries and the
Baltic States.  Free Trade Agreements for the three
States were signed on 18 July 1994 and came into
force 1 January 1995(5), replacing the trade aspects
of earlier agreements, as well as including political
dialogue. 

In order for the Baltic States to be included in the
preparation for accession, certain conditions had to
be met.  These include being able to satisfy the
three basic conditions of European identity,
democratic status and respect for human rights as
contained in the Treaty on European Union(6).  In
addition certain other conditions had to be met: the
existence of a functioning market economy, the
capacity to compete in the internal market of the
Union and the ability to take on the obligations of
membership including the adherence to the aims of
political, economic and monetary union. 

As early as 29 May 1995 the Council recorded that the
conditions had been met for the Baltic States to be
included in the strategy to prepare for accession as
defined by the European Council meeting in Essen. 
This has had the effect of allowing the Baltic States
to participate in the joint meetings under the
structured dialogue with the associated CEEC(7).

A key element of the strategy to prepare for
accession is the narrowing of the gap in preparation
of the associated States for integration into the
internal market of the EU.  Preparation for the
internal market is backed up by a variety of measures
designed to promote integration through the
development of infrastructure and of co-operation in
fields having above all a trans-European dimension
(including energy, environment, transport, science
and technology, etc.), and in the fields of common
foreign and security policy and of justice and home
affairs.  The PHARE programme, appropriately funded
within a multiannual financial framework in
accordance with the preparatory strategy agreed upon,
will provide support for this purpose.

PHARE and TACIS Democracy Programme
The process of trade liberalisation in the Baltic
States is one of the purposes of the PHARE and TACIS
programmes.  Projects under these two schemes include
measures to improve the ability of local
administration to handle trade flows, and by
developing export, credit and insurance facilities to
encourage regional trade.  The move towards
assistance to improve infrastructure and attract
investment is another priority of the PHARE
programme.  PHARE assistance to eliminate border
crossing obstacles in the Baltic region remains a
major instrument, for example, through the
development of the Via Baltica and the Helsinki-St
Petersburg corridor(8).

Aid from the PHARE programme continues to expand as
the following figures for 1993(9) and 1994(10)
demonstrate.

Financing from PHARE to Estonia amounted to 12 mECU
in 1993.  This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D      1.5 mECU
* General technical assistance;
  miscellaneous                   10.5 mECU 

In 1994 this figure rose to 22.5 mECU and breaks down
as follows: 
* Private sector, SMEs             8   mECU
* Environment and nuclear safety   2.5 mECU
* Education, training and R&D      4.5 mECU
* Infrastructure:
  energy, telecommunications,
    transport, etc.                   6 mECU
* GTAF(11) & others                 1.5 mECU

Financing from PHARE to Latvia amounted to 18 mECU in
1993.  This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D       2   mECU
* General technical assistance;
  miscellaneous                    16   mECU

This figure rose to 29.5 mECU in 1994 and breaks down
as follows: 
* Financial sector                 14.5 mECU

* Environment and nuclear safety    5.5 mECU
* Education, training and R&D       5   mECU
* GTAF & others                     4.5 mECU

Financing from PHARE to Lithuania amounted to 25 mECU
in 1993. This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D       2.5 mECU
* General technical assistance,
  miscellaneous                    22.5 mECU

This figure rose to 39 mECU in 1994 and breaks down
as follows: 
* Financial sector                 14.5 mECU
* Environment and nuclear safety   1    mECU
* Education, training and R&D      6    mECU
* Infrastructure:
  energy, telecommunications,
    transport, etc.               16.5  mECU
* GTAF & others                    1    mECU

At the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1995
certain priority concerns as regards financial
assistance under the PHARE scheme were laid down. 
PHARE has been redirected towards supporting the
strategy for preparation for accession, so its
programming is being carried out on a multiannual
basis. Technical assistance must take into account
implementation of the White Paper on preparing for
integration into the internal market(12).  Assistance
under the programme has been extended to include
investment activity in the field of infrastructures.

One example of how the PHARE programme has recently
helped Latvia is through the provision of an
emergency assistance package of 2.5 mECU in order to
assist efforts to stabilise the banking sector
following the collapse of Latvia's largest bank, Bank
Baltija(13).  This programme is designed to assist
the sixteen banks in Latvia which are still trading -
following the effective closure of 31 other banks and
to provide assistance to the Bank of Latvia in its
on-site supervision activities in order to help
prevent any further deterioration in the current
situation.

The TACIS Democracy Programme forms part of the
European Democracy Initiative of the European
Parliament.  It seeks to support the activities and
efforts of non-governmental bodies (NGOs) in
promoting a stable open society and good governance. 
It also focuses on the difficult or unpopular aspects
of political reform and democratic practice.  The
general objective is to contribute to the creation of
a human rights ethos in the countries concerned
whereby the general public is made aware of the rule
of law.  It supports the acquisition and application
of knowledge and techniques of parliamentary practice
and organisation by cross-party groups of
politicians(14) and by parliamentary staff.  The
Democracy Programme also covers the strengthening of
non-governmental bodies and associations which by
their vocation and specific activities can make a
continuing contribution to the promotion of a
pluralist society, as well as the transfer of
specific expertise and technical skills about
democratic practices and the rule of law to
professional groups and associations in the countries
concerned(15). 

Europe Agreements
The Europe Agreements establish bilateral
associations between each of the European countries
and the EU. They are based on shared understanding
and values, and set the path for progressive
convergence in a very wide range of activities.  They
are valid indefinitely with short transition periods
for Latvia and Lithuania.  Because of the progress of
economic and political reform in Estonia there is no
transitional period for this country.

As each agreement is the result of a separate
bilateral negotiation, there are a number of
differences of detail.  The objectives and main
elements are however the same.  The Europe Agreements
cover approximation of legislation, economic
co-operation, financial and political and cultural
co-operation as well as including provisions on the
prevention of activities such as illegal immigration,
drug trafficking and illegal trade in industrial
waste.  The Agreements include matters of both
Community and Member State competence.  Each
agreement contains a clause on observance of
democratic principles and human rights and a clause
enabling either party to suspend the agreement at
short notice if the obligations attached to it are
not respected.  The Europe Agreements additionally
take account of developments in certain sectors and
accordingly recognise the increased importance of
multilateral political dialogue and contain a new
heading on co-operation in crime prevention and
provisions for the three Baltic States to take part
in framework programmes, in specific programmes and
in projects or other schemes set up by the Community
in various areas.

Europe Agreements with the three Baltic States were
signed on 12 June 1995(16).  Following ratification
by all parties, including each individual Member
State, the agreements will enter into force.  Since
the signing of the Europe Agreements the three Baltic
States take part in the pre-accession strategy. The
main elements of the Europe Agreements are:

* political dialogue
* recognition of the importance of the involvement of
the Baltic States in WEU, the NATO Partnership for
Peace Initiative and the European Stability Pact;
* bilateral political dialogue in the framework of EA
as well as multilateral political dialogue;
* structured relationship with EU institutions, as
defined by the Essen European Council. 
* economic activities
* free trade in industrial goods;
* preferential treatment of trade in agricultural
products including those already processed;
* liberating trade in many services;
* national treatment for establishment and operations
of enterprises;
* national treatment for bidding for public contract
awards according to Community procurement rules;
* movement of workers: prevention of discrimination
against workers from any partner country legally
employed in the other country;
* co-ordination of social security systems for
legally employed workers and their families; 
* right of establishment of companies and national
treatment or MFN status(17); free movement of goods;
* transport.
* rules and approximation of laws

Commitments by the Baltic States to introduce similar
legislation as that applying in the EU - where this
is not already the case - concerning:
* competition rules and public undertakings(18),
including a safeguard clause in the event of
balance-of- payments difficulties; protection of
intellectual, commercial, industrial property;
* liberalisation of payments and capital transfers in
respect of trade and investments(19); approximation
of laws in other areas affecting the implementation
of the Agreements. 
* co-operation(20)
* economic co-operation;
* industrial co-operation;
* environmental co-operation;
* educational and training co-operation;
* monetary policy co-operation;
* financial co-operation (continuation PHARE aid and
other financial support);
* cultural co-operation.
* crime prevention co-operation.
* institutions
* Association Council at ministerial level to
regularly examine progress in the process of economic
reform;
* Association Committee at senior officials level;
* Parliamentary Association Committee.

Structured Relationship
The Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 agreed
that the associated countries will become members of
the Union when these countries are able to assume the
obligations of membership.  The Essen European
Council of December 1994 adopted a strategy to assist
the CEEC in preparing for their accession.  This
includes, amongst other things, a series of regular
meetings at ministerial level ('structured
relationship with the institutions of the European
Union') and the elaboration of a White Paper
identifying what the CEEC need to do (legally,
regulatory, institutionally, administratively) in
order to participate in the open internal market.

Political dialogue has been on-going since 1993.  For
example, on 19 April 1993 the Community 'troika' had
a meeting in Copenhagen with the foreign ministers of
the Baltic States, in December 1993 Latvia's Minister
for External Trade and EC Affairs, Olgerts
Pavlovskis, met Commissioner Van den Broek in
Brussels.  Under the structured relationship,
however, meetings at higher levels have intensified. 

A number of ministerial meetings have been held in a
variety of areas, for example: the meeting of
Ministers for Foreign Affairs on 10 April 1995 gave
rise to exchanges of views on several political
issues of mutual interest.  Meetings at the level of
Political Directors and European correspondents were
organised, as well as numerous meetings at expert
level

* the meeting of ministers with responsibility for
the internal market met in June 1995 along with
Baltic State representatives.  The meeting discussed
and exchanged views on the Commission White Paper on
the preparation of the associated countries for
integration into the internal market;

* the meeting of the Research Council in June 1995,
at which stock was taken of the progress on
scientific and technical co-operation with the CEEC,
the alignment policy implemented by the associated
countries and the forecasts for their participation
in Community research programmes; 

* the Heads of Government and State of the associated
States were invited to meet alongside the Cannes
European Council in 1995;

The structured dialogue has continued under the
Spanish Presidency in the following fields: 
* Justice and Home Affairs;
* Transport;
* Agriculture;
* Education;
* Foreign Affairs.

Stability Pact(21)

The European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993
discussed the French proposal for an initiative to be
taken by the European Union in favour of a Pact on
stability in Europe.  This initiative is directed
towards assuring in practice the application of the
principles agreed by European countries with regard
to respect for borders and rights of minorities.  The
European Council agreed that recent events in Europe
have shown that action in these areas is timely and
appropriate.  It welcomed the idea of using the
instrument of 'Joint Action' in accordance with the
procedures provided for in the Common Foreign and
Security policy.

In the Common Foreign and Security Policy framework,
the Pact on Stability in Europe is intended to
promote preventive diplomacy and therefore is not
concerned with countries in conflict.  Initially, it
will be directed at those countries which have the
prospect of becoming members of the EU and with which
the Union has concluded or negotiated agreements. 
This includes the Baltic States.  The aim of the
initiative is to contribute to stability by averting
tension and potential conflicts in Europe, fostering
neighbourly relations and encouraging countries to
consolidate their borders and to resolve problems of
national minorities.

The inaugural meeting took place in Paris in March
1994.  The documents setting in train the process
which will lead to the conclusion of the Pact on
stability in Europe were concluded following a round
table discussion(22).  Countries participating were
those which make a particular contribution to the
initiative, countries immediately bordering on the
countries having association agreements and countries
with an interest in stability, in Europe by virtue of
their defence commitments(23).  Representatives of
international organisations concerned by the
initiative also participated(24). 

The European Union reaffirmed its will to mobilise
its economic and financial instruments as its
contribution to the success of this undertaking at
the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1994. At
the Cannes European Council meeting in June 1995, the
European Union further specified some of the
accompanying measures to be taken under PHARE along
side the Stability Pact.  These include, projects
concerning regional transboundary co-operation,
issues relating to minorities, cultural co-
operation, including, language training and
administrative training, and environmental problems. 

White Paper(25) on preparation of the associated
countries of Central and Eastern Europe for
integration into the Internal Market of the Union(26) 

The White Paper marks the beginning of a process.  It
provides a guide for the associated countries in
adapting their legal structures to those which are
needed for future participation in the internal
market. It sets out a logical sequence for adopting
the necessary measures and will enable associated
countries to draw up internal market work programmes
adapted to each country's own economic and reform
priorities.  It will also enable the European Union
to provide the kind of support which is most needed,
drawing on the necessary expertise in the Union's own
institutions, in the Member States and in the private
sector.

The White Paper(27) focuses on legislation which is
essential for the functioning of the internal market.
It shows the key measures in each sector and those
measures which should be tackled first, without
setting up priorities as between sectors, including:
* free movement of goods;
* free movement of services;
* free movement of persons;
* freedom of capital movements;
* competition policy;
* state aids.

It also describes in detail the administrative and
organisational structures which are required in each
sector if the legislation is to be effectively
implemented and enforced. 

The EU recognises that certain assistance needs are
common to all associated countries.  To this end the
Commission intends to establish a Technical
Assistance Information Exchange Office supported
through the PHARE programme.  The Office will be
located in Brussels and managed by the Commission. 
It will provide for the exchange of information and
will help ensure the adequate delivery of services to
the associated countries.  This includes Community
legislation, its transposition into national
legislation, legal terminology, translation, training
and exchanges.

The White Paper also highlights the current state of
play in the relationship between the CEEC and the
European Union, detailing the progress made to date
with legislative approximation and specific sectors,
including:
* company law;
* financial sector;
* agriculture;
* transport;
* competition policy;
* telecommunications;
* intellectual property.

Conclusion
The relationship between the European Union and the
three Baltic States has changed dramatically over the
last few years.  It has progressed from simple trade
arrangements to trade agreements and, this year, to
Europe Agreements.  All three states have expressed a
desire to become part of the European Union, Latvia
and Estonia have formally applied for membership. 
The IGC will address some of the questions
surrounding the accession of new Member States to the
Union in 1996.

and does not prejudice any aspect of such
negotiations.  Accession negotiations will cover the
entire field of Community legislation and policy,
whereas the White Paper focuses on those Community
measures which create and maintain the internal
market.  In addition, the White Paper does not change
the contractual relationship between the EU and the
Baltic States, which is based on the Europe
Agreements.  As detailed in these agreements, the
approximation of legislation is monitored by a
specific Sub-Committee
(27) The annex to the White Paper provides a
comprehensive and detailed presentation of current EU
legislation relating to the internal market. 
Twenty-three different areas of legislation are
examined in turn

-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION: ITC statement on
ITN shareholdings held by Carlton and Granada

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION
COMMISSION: ITC statement on ITN shareholdings held
by Carlton and Granada
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The ITC has considered a proposal drawn up on a
contingency basis under which both Carlton Television
and Granada Television would create two new
deadlocked companies owned by them to hold shares in
ITN which are in excess of the levels allowed in the
Broadcasting Act 1990.  After scrutiny of the plan
and taking account of legal advice, the ITC has
concluded that such a scheme, if completed by 31
December 1995, would not breach the provisions of the
Act.

However, the Members of the Commission believe that
such arrangements raise not only legal but also
important policy and regulatory issues.  It is the
view of the Commission that the proposed structure is
contrary to the spirit and intention of the
Broadcasting Act 1990.

As a consequence of the acquisition of Central
Television by Carlton Television and LWT by Granada
Television, the holdings of 18 per cent held by each
company increased to 36 per cent. The Act established
that there should be a limit of 20 per cent on any
individual shareholding by a deadline to be set by
the ITC.

The original deadline of 31 December 1994 for selling
the excess shares was extended by one year pending
the completion of a review by Ministers of a range of
ownership issues.  The Secretary of State for
National Heritage confirmed earlier this year that
the Government did not propose to raise the existing
limits on shareholdings in a nominated news Provider
and the ITC has stated that it expects disposal to
take place by the stipulated date of 31 December
1995.

The ITC regrets that Carlton and Granada are giving
active consideration to interpreting the ownership
rules of the Broadcasting Act in a way which in the
ITC' s view was not originally intended by
Parliament.

David Glencross, Chief Executive, ITC said:
"We have urged Carlton and Granada to reduce their
shareholdings to the level envisaged by the Act as
soon as is practicable, and in a way which is
consistent with both the spirit and the letter of the
legislation.

"We very much hope that the new broadcasting
legislation will address avoidance mechanisms of this
kind".

-PHILIPS: Czech Telecom uses technology from Philips
to increase the number of telephone lines

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PHILIPS: Czech Telecom
uses technology from Philips to increase the number
of telephone lines -- Philips awarded order worth DM
2 million for PCM MULTI multi-channel transmission
system
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The Czech network operator SPT has awarded Philips
Transmission Networks in Nuremberg, Germany, an order
for the delivery of PCM MULTI systems.  The order is
valued at some DM 2 million.

PCM MULTI, the new multi-channel transmission system,
will enable the network operator SPT to make multiple
use of existing two-wire telephone lines.  This
capability is especially important wherever, due to
poor infrastructure, only one telephone line is
available, and yet a much larger number of lines is
required. 

Using the PCM MULTI system, up to eleven independent
analogue voice channels can be transmitted digitally
using the HDSL transmission technique via one
two-wire line.  The echo cancellation procedure with
the internationally standardised 2B IQ line code is
used for direction separation.  The PCM MULTI system
comprises a connection unit at the subscriber's
premises and one at the exchange.  PCM MULTI can be
used in both analogue and digital telecommunications
networks.  In the ISDN, a maximum of five telephone
lines are available.

The PCM MULTI units are powered via a central 48/60 V
exchange battery.  A power supply is therefore not
required on the subscriber side.  The bridgeable
distance between the connection unit at the
subscriber's premises and the exchange depends on the
subscriber line diameter.  Using cable with a
conductor diameter of 0.4 mm, a distance in excess of
3 km can be bridged.  Being so quick and easy to
install in existing telecommunications
infrastructures, PCM MULTI represents an affordable
way of extending the number of telecommunication
lines.

-PHILIPS: DM4 million high-bit-rate SDH and broadband
digital TV transmission system order from PTT Telecom

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PHILIPS: Dutch operator
PTT Telecom awards Philips of Nuremberg order worth
over DM 4 million for delivery of high-bit-rate SDH
and broadband digital television transmission systems
-- The systems are ideal for the cost-effective
installation of broadband distributive networks
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The Dutch operator PTT Telecom has awarded Philips
Transmission Networks in Nuremberg, Germany, an order
worth over DM 4 million to deliver SLE-16 SDH systems
with transmission rates of 2.5 Gbit/s and DIMOS
digital television transmission systems for bit rates
of up to 140 Mbit/s.

Using this combination of equipment, PTT Telecom will
be able to expand the coverage of its broadband
distributive networks still further at a
cost-effective price. TV and radio channels will be
transmitted in digital format via fibre-optic cable. 

DIMOS, the digital television transmission system, is
able to transmit one or more TV channels in PAL,
NTSC, SECAM or D2-MAC.  It can also be used to relay
radio channels and data.  The signals are transmitted
at a data rate of 140 Mbit/s.  As a result of the
high transmission quality, DIMOS is equally ideal for
exchanging channels between TV studios as it is -
when used in combination with SDH transmission
equipment - for feeding channels into broadband
distributive networks. 

Transmission in the long-haul network is achieved
using the SLE-16 SDH transmission systems.  These are
each capable of accepting sixteen DIMOS systems
simultaneously at the central feeding point.

Factors encouraging the network operator to deploy
the DIMOS and SLE-16 systems for setting up new
network structures include the quality of the video,
audio and data transmission, as well as cost
considerations.  By using different coding boards,
DIMOS can be adapted for a host of applications.  In
suitable networks, up to sixty TV and sixty FM
channels, plus two DSR packages (32 digital radio
channels), can be broadcast, for example.

-BTRIEVE TECHNOLOGIES: Btrieve Technologies launches
fastest ever solution for Open Database Connectivity

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BTRIEVE TECHNOLOGIES:
Btrieve Technologies launches fastest ever solution
for Open Database Connectivity
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020196

* Btrieve solution 7 to 15 times faster than current
products
* Supports immediate integration with third party
products
* Windows interface
* 50% price reduction offer

Btrieve Technologies, Inc (BTI), a leading supplier
of database engines, today announced that it has
launched to the market its own ODBC drivers (Open
Database Connectivity) which will enable users to
maximise the performance of applications using ODBC. 
With its solution, Btrieve will enable developers to
benefit fully from a generic application interface
whilst maintaining all the attributes of Btrieve and
Scalable SQL.

Btrieve's ODBC drivers - functionalities explained
Following a high number of in-house tests, the
solution offered by Btrieve Technologies has proved
to be 7 to 15 times faster than the ODBC products
currently available on the market.  Reasons for this
marked performance are: 
* An ODBC driver which fully utilises the syntax
analysis (parsing) technology, as well as all the new
functions available in the latest generation of
database engines and the MicroKernel database engine
architecture.

* The ODBC interfaces for Windows 3.11 and Windows
95/Windows NT are 16 Bits and 32 Bits respectively.

* Btrieve's ODBC drivers support immediate
integration into third party products such as:
Microsoft Access, Visual Basic, PowerBuilder, Delphi,
Crystal Reports, etc.

* A configuration which supports the client/server
methodology of Btrieve's relational database,
Scalable SW and navigational database, Btrieve.

* The ODBC interface conforms to all the following
standards:-
 - it completely supports all the functions of ODBC
Application Programming Interface (API) Level 1, plus
certain functions of Level 2;
 - it will provide ODBC minimum and core grammar. 
Certain extended grammar functions are already
supported.

ODBC - special offers available
Until January 31, 1996, it will be possible to obtain
Btrieve Technologies' ODBC Commercial Development Kit
at a 50% reduced price, and Scalable SQL or the
Btrieve workstation engine (for a user) bought with
each dopy of the ODBC Interface at a reduction of
30%.

The ODBC Commercial Deployment Kit includes the ODBC
Interface for Windows 3.11 and Windows 95, and the
distribution licence.  It gives developers the right
to deploy up to 1,000 ODBC drivers with an
application.

Product information
Btrieve's database engines are built on its
'model-independent' MicroKernel Database
Architecture.  This separates the classic model
functions of a database, and allows users to benefit
from all the advantages of new applications with
different kinds of database without having to invest
in the costs of migration.  Thereby a
business-critical operation can be managed without
impact on the original system, by applications using:
the 'navigational' database model (Btrieve), the
'object oriented' database model, or the 'relational'
database model (Scalable SQL.

About Btrieve Technologies
Founded in April 1994, Btrieve Technologies Inc (BTI)
is based in Austin, Texas, with European headquarters
in Paris, France.  This private company, partner of
both Novell and Microsoft, is a leading provider of
high-performance, multi-platform database engines. 
BTI's mission is to develop and deliver advanced
information management solutions, offering intuitive
control over large amounts of distributed, complex,
heterogeneous data.  Current BTI products include the
first navigational client/server database, Btrieve 6,
and the relational database, Scalable SQL.  Both
products are built on BTI's MicroKernel Database
Architecture, which manages data in a common,
model-independent format and allows both types of
applications - navigational and SQL relational -
simultaneous access to data.

-MESSE MUNCHEN: Munich trade fair boss Dr Werner
Marzin retires

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MESSE MUNCHEN: Munich
trade fair boss Dr Werner Marzin retires
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:191295

* The Minister-President of the Free State of Bavaria
presented the President of Messe Munchen GmbH on the
occasion of his retirement with the Knight
Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany

On November 30th 1995, Dr Werner Marzin, the longest
serving trade fair boss in Germany, celebrated his
departure from active professional life and his
transition into retirement in the company of
colleagues, partners and friends in Hall 23 of the
Munich Trade Fair Centre.

The importance of his work for the trade fair
business in Munich and worldwide was underlined in
speeches given by the Minister- President of the Free
State of Bavaria, Dr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian
Minister of Economics, Transport and Technology, Dr
Otto Wiesheu, the Lord Mayor of Munich, capital of
Bavaria, Christian Ude, and by the President of the
Chamber of Trades and Crafts for Munich and Upper
Bavaria, Heinrich Traublinger.  On this successful
evening, attended by more than a thousand guests, the
Bavarian Minister-President awarded the Knight
Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany to Dr Marzin for his
"decades of successful work for the benefit of Munich
as a trade fair location and in the interests of the
trade fair business throughout Germany".

In 1964 Dr Werner Marzin joined the recently founded
Munich Trade Fair and Exhibition organisation, and he
has remained loyal to it for over 30 years.  Since
1968 he has also held the office of President of the
GHM, Gesellschaft for Handwerksausstellungen und
-messen mbH (Handicrafts Exhibitions and Fairs,
Organisation), since 1978 that of President of Messe
Munchen GmbH, and since 1981 also that of President
of IMAG, Internationaler Messe - und
Ausstellungsdienst mbH (International Exhibition and
Fair Service Ltd.). In this role he formed the
promotional umbrella organisation, MMI - Messe
Munchen International - and thus created a distinct
identity for Munich as a trade fair location. 
Honorary offices were also conferred upon him, such
as, for example, Member of the Steering Committee of
the UFI - Union des Foires Internationales (World
Federation of the International Trade Fair and
Exhibition Industry), Vice-President of the
Ausstellungs- und Messeausschuss der Deutschen
Wirtschaft (AUMA e.V., (Confederation of German Trade
Fair and Exhibition Industries), Member of the
Landesvorstand des Bayerischen Handwerkstages
(Regional Board of the Handicrafts Convention of
Bavaria) and Vice-President of the Export club of
Bavaria.  He was also honoured with many awards from
Germany and abroad for his services in the trade fair
business.

Dr Marzin will continue to put his long years of
professional experience at the service of Messe
Munchen through his involvement primarily in
neighbouring countries in Central and Eastern Europe
through the regional office of Messe Munchen in
Vienna.

The fact that Munich, a comparatively recently
developed trade fair location, now has a
comprehensive programme of major international trade
fairs and is at the forefront of worldwide
competition, is due in large part to the efforts of
Dr Werner Marzin.  Yet he has also fought for the
future of trade fairs in Munich.  His was the
initiative behind the building of the New Munich
Trade Fair Center, a modern trade fair site that will
secure the competitiveness of Munich as an
international trade fair location through into the
next millenium.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-IPC MAGAZINES: Robert
Powell -- Cured by a carrott! in this weeks Woman's
Own
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020195

They say carrots are good for you, but comedy cop
Robert Powell has revealed that his Detectives
co-star Jasper Carrott has much more serious healing
powers.

In this week's issue of Woman's Own, Robert reveals
for the first time how Jasper's touch cured him of a
painful ailment whilst filming one of their shows. 
He says: "I had something wrong with one of my eyes -
it suddenly became incredibly sore.  But Jasper
managed to get rid of it just by the laying on of
hands.  I was up and running very quickly."

But Jasper himself is very modest about the incident
and says: "It was probably a coincidence, although I
do believe everybody has the ability to heal.

"It's not a matter of belief, it's a physical fact. 
There's nothing particularly mystical or spiritual
about it.  Everybody has the ability, but some people
are better than others.  I wouldn't want people to
get the wrong idea about it, either - I'm not going
around healing people all the time.  But I really do
think that anyone can do it.  A mother instinctively
heals a child's knee by rubbing it, and it's just an
extension of that."

-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE: Men's Health Awareness
Campaign -- Lose your gut in six weeks

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE:
Men's Health Awareness Campaign -- Lose your gut in
six weeks
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

More than half of all men in the UK are overweight,
but losing you gut is simple, says MEN'S HEALTH
Magazine.

The average beer gut - the type that's just creeping
over your trousers and making you wear your jacket
open - is about 6lbs of excess fat and if you aim to
lose 1lb a week you'll be back to the taut stomach of
your youth within six short weeks.

If you have a bigger belly problem, you'll just have
to keep repeating your six-week plan until you don't!

Now for the bad news.  To shift 1lb of fat you have
to lose 3,500 calories. This may seem a depressing
statistic, but if you see your beer gut as half -
pound packets of butter hanging around your middle
and picture losing two of those packets a week, a lb
a week suddenly seems like quite a lot! says MEN'S
HEALTH Magazine.

The equation for losing your beer gut is
straightforward - calories in versus calories out
through exercise.  Just work out how much exercise
you are willing to do and the rest of the calories
you have to cut from your diet. 

But remember, diet and exercise COMBINED is the most
efficient way to lose weight, so aim to lose 50% of
your calories from your diet and burn off 50% through
exercise, says MEN'S HEALTH.

Now get out your calculator and do your sum.  Firstly
work out how many calories you need to maintain your
weight.  An easy guide is to multiply your body
weight in kilograms by 35.  So, for example, if you
weigh 76 kilos, you need 2,660 calories to keep your
weight steady.

You already know that to lose one lb of fat you need
to lose 3,500 calories a week and that's 500 a day. 
This could mean you burn-up an extra 250 calories
through exercise and you cut 250 calories from your
daily diet. 

To find out how many calories you are going to burn
from exercise, consult the following table and
multiply the number beside your chosen exercise (s)
by your body weight in kilos to find out your hourly
calorie burn. 

Rowing                         9.5
Cycling (road 10mph.)     6 to 8
Cycling (stationary)      3 to 5
Stairmaster                    6
Weight-lifting                 3
Running (6mph)                10
Swimming                      10
Skiing                         7
Social football                2.5
In-line skating                7
Speed-walking                  4.5
Tennis                         7
Golf (carrying clubs)          5.5
Aerobics (low-impact)          5

For example, if you decide to cycle to work three
times a week and it takes half an hour, multiply the
figure for cycling (6) by your body weight and you
will find out your hourly calorie burn.  IE: Cycling
: 6. So 6 x 76kg (body weight) = 456 calories burned
per hour.  Therefore 1 1/2 hours a week cycling 684
calories burned.  As you need to lose 3,500 calories
a week, that still leaves 2,816 excess calories which
you will have to take out of your diet. That's 402
calories a day.  So, subtract 402 calories from the
amount you should be eating to maintain your weight,
2,660, and you will find out your new calorie intake
should be 2,258 calories a day.

To achieve weight-loss as well as cardiovascular
fitness, you should ideally aim to exercise three or
four times a week for around 30 to 40 minutes,
advises MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  If you do less than
this, you will have to train very hard to get enough
calorie burn and you will be more likely to give up.

And remember, if you have been fairly sedentary for a
while, start exercising gently and build up
gradually.  Walking, cycling a-id swimming are ideal
starting off exercises because you can achieve a good
calorie burn without much risk of injury.

Food wise, you need to reduce your fat intake by
choosing low-fat versions of the basic foods (butter,
milk and cheese) and only eat lean meat cooked
without any added fat.  Make sure you cut right back
on pastry dishes, pies and chips and eat lots more
vegetables, energy-giving complex carbohydrates
(pasta, rice, potatoes and bread) and switch to fresh
fruit instead of fattening puds.

Be very wary of takeaways because they can be laden
with fat - even a lunchtime sandwich my be burdened
with high-fat butter and mayonnaise - and cut back on
beer.  At around 180 calories plus per pint, a
lunchtime pint plus a couple in the evening can mount
up to about 550 calories in a day!  Dry white wine
has far less sugar than beer or try spirits with a
slim-line mixer. 

Francis Cottam, the Editor of MEN'S HEALTH Magazine
says:
"It's not difficult for a man to lose his gut, but it
does take an organised effort.  Most men want to be
fitter, healthier and sexier.  A flabby out of shape
body signals poor health and low self-esteem.  A
well-toned physique radiates good health and
self-confidence. 1996 is the year for men to shape-up
for a better life. We'll show you how.`

-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE: Reasons to be cheerful! -- 10
ways men can make themselves happy in 1996

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE:
Reasons to be cheerful! -- 10 ways men can make
themselves happy in 1996
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

* TAKE A 'HAPPY DAY' OFF WORK
"For many British workers, the sneaky day-off under
the pretence of flu, migraine or botulism is me of
the most popular routes to temporary happiness," says
MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  "And it's almost always
happier than a legitimate holiday, because there is
no pressure to have a great time, it's a day just for
you." In fact, a lot of sickness absence is simply a
stress-relieving exercise - you've worked hard m a
project and you need a day-off.  In Sweden, workers
are given a number of 'mental health days' by their
employers, which they can take without having to
phone in to say they've got the lurgy.

So next time you genuinely feel the need for a
stress-busting day-off, don't call it a 'sickie'.  Be
positive and call it 'a happy day'.

* HAVE A LAUGH
The very act of laughing helps you feel happy.  And
the sillier, the better, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. 
Research shows people who are most happy seem to be
eccentrics who don't care what the world thinks of
them.  Monty Python had it right all along. "When you
laugh, your whole body benefits from an internal
massage," says MEN'S HEALTH. "This relaxes muscle
tension, reduces stress in the nervous system, you
breathe deeper, you have greater circulation and
endorphin 'happy' chemicals are released." 

* DO THINGS THAT MADE YOU HAPPY AS A KID
Research has found that in average kids smile 400
times a day, whereas adults only times a day - so try
reverting to your childhood pleasure, says MEN'S
HEALTH Magazine. "Fly a kite, play Scalextric, go to
the seaside and build sandcastles or go ride your
bike.  For many of us, the times we remember being
happiest were Saturday mornings, with no school to go
to, the world to explore and a Raleigh Chopper to do
it on" 

* SMELL A 'HAPPY SMELL'
Of the five sense, smell is the me most directly
linked to the brain, says MEN'S HEALTH.  "The
olfactory nerve goes into the part of the brain that
deals with emotions, moods, hormone release and
primitive instincts.  Even by simply making you
breathe more deeply, essential oils can have a
beneficial effect.  Breathing well and feeling
relaxed is a pretty happy state to be in."

Choose an essential oil that is classified as
'uplifting' such as rosewood mixed with lime or a
coriander and lemon mixture - but don't heat ails
over a candle, you will simply cook up all the
residue and give yourself a splitting headache! 
Instead, invest in an Aroma Diffuser from the chemist
or evaporate the oils over a pan of boiling water.
You could also try frying some bacon and then
tantalise your sense of taste with a bacon buttie!

* GET FILTHY
It's not often nowadays that a man can enjoy the
honest pleasure of getting caked in filth.  But in
our modern world of order, cleanliness and desk
tidies, there's spiritual renewal to be had from
simply getting mucky, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

* DRIVE A TANK FOR THE DAY
Give a new meaning to road-rage.  Off-road centres
around the UK offer the experience of driving a range
of 4WD and ex-military  vehicles and a few have
tanks!  Driving a 55-ton Chieftain tank is
'absolutely brilliant' says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. 
"You sit in a very small cab with your head poking
out of the top.  There is a real sensation of power
and control as you accelerate and all you see if you
go uphill is the sky."

* EAT HAPPY FOOD
If you really fancy a flake, have one.  The power of
chocolate is legendary, it's the all-purpose
happiness drug, says MEN'S HEALTH.  It contains
phenylethylamine, or PEA, a substance that is turned
into noradrenalin in the brain and could have an
addictive effect.  It has even been likened to the
feeling of 'being in-love'.  Chocolate is also high
in sugar and because many people suffer from low
blood-sugar which makes them feel mentally and
physically sluggish, lethargic and possibly fed-up,
chocolate can give you a quick lift for an hour or so
which can be positively mood enhancing. "A one or two
day detox can also work wonders, both mentally and
physically, but don't go on a water-only fast.  Eat
fresh fruit, vegetables and brown rice all weekend
and by Sunday evening, you will really feel on form. 
Your mental clarity will be good and your aches and
pains will have cleared up," says MEN'S HEALTH
Magazine.

* GET A NATURAL EXERCISE ENDORPHIN HIGH
Endorphins are naturally occurring morphine-like
opiates within the body and they are linked to
feelings of happiness.  Certain enjoyable activities
- love and sex, drinking alcohol and eating - can all
be linked to the production of endorphins, but none
is as effective as vigorous exercise. 

* GO AND LOOK AT SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
Visit an art gallery.  Art provides mental
stimulation.  If you are feeling low, go and learn
something, expand your mind - it is a key to
happiness, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

- WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, INDULGE YOURSELF!
There are times when even the fittest, most
spiritually pure triathlon runners find true
happiness with a couple cans of beer, a chicken
Biriyani from the local takeaway and a night on the
sofa with a Van Damme video. "It's only one meal in a
week that might contain 21 of them so enjoy it and
don't feel guilty," says MEN'S HEALTH, "but don't
make it the norm." 

And remember, me of the highest causes of stress is
that people are waiting for happiness to happen, says
MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  It's the Puritan Work Ethic -
we work hard now in order to buy future shares in
happiness.  For a man, it's part of the no-pain,
no-gain, no-such-thing-as-a-free lunch philosophy. 
So stop waiting for happiness to happen and think
about what makes you happy NOW.

PA group company, Two-Ten Communications' decision to
open a Web-site to carry all the traffic from its UNS
NewsWire service has opened a 'window' for
journalists who, up to now, have had to plough
through mountains of paper and fax press releases to
find their stories.

The Internet service - currently up to 50 stories on
weekdays and almost 90 on Budget Day - will gradually
extend to include all releases sent out by Two-Ten on
paper and fax on behalf of its 2,000 PR clients.

Until now, UNS - which carries general and business
news, features and advisories has only been available
to national and regional daily newspapers and major
news agencies and broadcasters.  Now, any journalist
can access it on the Internet, making the service
available to magazine journalists and freelance
correspondents and also to staff with a PC and modem
working from home.

"UNS on the Net" can be found at
www.twoten.press.net.
The Netscape facility 'client-pull' allows news
organisations to keep to up-to-date with news stories
as they are transmitted.  Managing Director, Paul
McFarland explains "Internet users recognise that a
drawback is the need for the user to go hunting for
news and updates.  Our service is designed so that if
a PC is connected to the Net and tuned to the Two-Ten
index, the page will automatically update itself
whenever a new story is released.  So, as with wire
services and Teletext, journalists can keep an eye on
the news without having to keep re-accessing." 

NOTE TO EDITORS:
Two-Ten is part of the Press Association group, which
includes PA News and PA Sport, the UK's leading news
and sport agencies.  Two-Ten's UNS news and picture
wire service is delivered via the PA satellite
network to national and regional daily newspapers and
major news agencies and broadcasters.

Two-Ten is the leading provider of media and
financial information and distribution services to
the Public Relations industry, employing 125 people
at its central London operation.  In addition, the
company has another 80 staff at its Wetherby
operational centre in West Yorkshire, which provides
a wide range of fulfilment and response services,
including subscription management, telephone
order-taking, storage, packaging and distribution.

-THE SCOTTISH OFFICE: The secretary of state's new
year message

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE SCOTTISH OFFICE: The
secretary of state's new year message
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

In his New Year message to the people of Scotland,
the Rt Hon Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for
Scotland, writes:- 
"My most striking memory of the past year is of the
first public engagement I carried out as Secretary of
State, when I attended the VJ Day ceremonies.  I was
privileged to meet some of the veterans whose
sacrifices won our freedom.  They were so unassuming
that it was difficult to realise that they had -
quite literally - save  the world from tyranny.  But
that is precisely what they did.

"VE Day and VJ Day left a lasting impression on me
and I found myself wondering during the following
weeks what fitting memorial we could create in
Scotland, in the 50th anniversary year of the
victorious conclusion of the Second World War, to
those who fought and in many cases lost their lives
in that conflict.  Then I became aware of the history
of the former Rowardennan estate on the east bank of
Loch Lomond.

"Because of its outstanding quality, this land was
purchased by the Government in 1950 under the terms
of the National Land Fund 'to preserve the natural
beauty of the area, safeguard public access and
utilise the land for forestry and agriculture'. 
Today the land is owned by Forest Enterprise and the
National Trust for Scotland.  At my request, these
bodies have agreed to undertake the management of the
area in partnership, with a view to creating a major
national monument. 

"I am pleased, therefore, to announce our intention
to establish the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park,
dedicated to the memory of all those who served our
country in the Second World War.  The Memorial Park
will be based on conservation principles, giving
priority to landscape, nature conservation and quiet
recreation.  An integrated management strategy will
include a project for increasing the native woodland
areas within the park.  It is our objective to ensure
that the Memorial Park is protected for all time as
an inalienable national property, permanently
dedicated to this purpose.

"We shall also be launching a national competition to
devise a memorial to the fallen as a focal point to
the park.  Future generations will be able to enjoy
this superb environment, while recalling the
sacrifices that were made to secure for us our
present liberties and quality of life.

"That inheritance can no longer be taken for granted. 
Once again our way of life is threatened - this time
by an enemy within.  The drugs epidemic is a scourge
as terrible as any medieval plague.  This country
strove in unity, as one nation, during the Second
World War to defeat tyranny.  We must find that unity
again to crush the drugs menace. 

"Let us, as a nation, make a New Year resolution that
1996 is the year in which we will turn back the tide
of drug abuse which is engulfing our young people and
threatening our civilisation.  Our aim is nothing
less than to win back Scotland from the drug culture
and liberate a generation.  That is of far more
importance than any party political objective.  We
must unite across party lines and across every age
group to drive the drug barons out of our
communities.  This is not a campaign: it is a
crusade.

"We must rediscover the spirit of wartime unity.  I
am delighted that the leaders of all the political
parties in Scotland are keen to join forces to launch
a major new national initiative against drugs. 
Scotland Against Drugs will seek to unite communities
in fighting drugs misuse. The success of local
anti-drugs campaigns, notably those run by the
Glasgow Evening Times and the Paisley Daily Express,
has paved the way to a nationwide effort.  Its
purpose will be to educate and dissuade young people
from taking drugs.

"It will be launched in January under the auspices of
the Health Education Board for Scotland, linking into
the work of agencies which are already involved in
the fight against drugs.  I hope that it will enjoy
the active support of every MP in Scotland, all the
media, the business community and the country at
large.

"Scotland Against Drugs will publish the facts about
drug misuse; support efforts against local drug
dealing; promote drug-free activities for young
people; and stimulate community attempts to combat
drugs. If we are to divert young people from drugs,
we must spell out one simple message: drugs are for
losers.  But that message will only have credibility
if young people see a real prospect of becoming
winners. We must work together to provide
opportunities for the next generation and the key to
that is partnership.

"In all our endeavours we shall gain strength from
working together. 1 have enjoyed the six months I
have served as Secretary of State, despite the heavy
workload, because I have discovered that, in this
office, you can make a difference - you can make
things happen. Scotland has huge reserves of talent
and enterprise.  But they need to be encouraged and
unleashed.  That is my objective: to help Scotland
fulfil its potential.

"I should like to thank all the people who have
already helped me in this task: the staff of St
Andrew's House and everybody across Scotland who
contributed to my consultation exercise.  Highland
Region and local activists gave invaluable help in
saving the Fort William sleeper service.  The Scotch
Whisky Association were doughty lobbyists and the
fruits of their work were seen in the Budget. All my
Scottish Conservative parliamentary colleagues stood
united, without exception, against the Bill to
introduce Double Summer time which would be very
unwelcome in Scotland; this united stance was clearly
decisive in depriving the Bill of Government support. 

"And there were many other partnerships: with the
doctors and others in the NHS who helped to shape the
policies that led to the rescheduling of Temazepam;
Locate in Scotland's success in securing the Chungwha
inward investment project; Scottish Screen Locations,
on a shoestring budget, helping to create a promising
Scottish film industry; and many more - too many to
be listed here.

"The Scottish economy is a success story.  The latest
export figures, for 1994, show a leap of almost 24
per cent over the previous year to more than GBP 14
billion.  We now export more per head than Japan -
who would have imagined that ten years ago?

"During the last year unemployment fell below 200,000
to its lowest level in 15 years; that means a happier
New Year for many Scottish households than was the
case in previous years.  Scotland's unemployment rate
has now been below that of the United Kingdom for
almost four years and long-term unemployment is
falling. 

"If I had one wish for 1996 it would be that all of
us in politics should realise we do not have a
monopoly of good ideas in any one party and that we
should try to find common ground.  I have tried to do
so in 1995.  One example is Campbell Christie's
suggestion of revamping the Scottish Economic Council
to serve Scotland better.  It was a good idea and we
took it on board.  Similarly, many good ideas on
devolution of power to local government were
contained in the paper submitted by COSLA last month. 
In 1996 we will make some of these ideas reality.

"My own resolution for 1996 is to make our country
safer.

Maintenance of law and order is the first duty of
government.  That is why, in the year ahead, we shall
be ensuring that the punishment fits the crime and
that criminals do not walk out of prison half-way
through their sentences.  Drugs can never be
tolerated in prisons; random drug testing is our
answer.  We must give strong support to the police. 
That is why we are putting 500 more officers onto the
streets and giving them the technological help they
need, such as DNA. testing facilities and automatic
fingerprint reading machines.  Let us make a
resolution that 1996 will be a very bad year for
criminals in Scotland. 

"The successes of 1995 point the way ahead for 1996. 
In a spirit of partnership rather than dissension we
must persevere in securing Scotland's interests and
liberating the talents and enterprise of our people
to make our country stable and prosperous.  That is
the spirit in which I ask you to join with me in
striving to make 1996, for everyone in Scotland, a
truly happy New Year."
