<H2> THE POWER OF CAT'S CLAW </H2>

<p>   Cat's Claw, also referred to as "u&#241;a de gato" and "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest," is the new leader in naturally occurring anti-inflammatories and immune-supportive agents. All Cat's Claw utilized in Life Plus products is of the highest quality and is harvested in the Peruvian Rainforest in a sustainable ecological friendly manner. Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated from the inner bark of this wonderful plant. These oxindole alkaloids have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system as well as have a profound effect on the ability of white blood cells to engulf and digest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter. This natural process is called phagocytosis. Other alkaloids and phytochemicals present in Cat's Claw have been shown to provide natural support against many viri. When included in the diet, they naturally  insure  normal  blood  pressure  and  help  prevent inflammation, plus act as anti-mutagenic agents.</p>
 <p>   Life Plus CATS CLAW FORTE Drops contain the highest quality u&#241;a de gato available worldwide and is standardized. As a true daptogen with almost unlimited therapeutic applications, Cat's Claw has been called by experts as a "World Class Herb," a "Miracle Herb" and a "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest." Health care providers are now using it successfully with their patients in the prevention of many conditions such as arthritis, cancer, AIDS, Crohn's Disease, viral infections, respiratory infections, allergies, herpes, prostrate problems, lupus, Epstein Parr, rheumatism, chronic fatigue syndrome, PMS, diabetes and a variety of stomach and bowel disorders.</p>

<h2>MAXIMIZED BIOAVAILABLITY</h2>
 <p>  Dr. Klaus Keplinger's group in Austria are, by far, the most knowledgeable in the subject of Cat's Claw. They have researched Cat's Claw and its extraction methods for over fifteen years.  The following is quoted from an English translation from some of Keplinger's published information to Doctors and Pharmacists. Quoted from an English translation of "Radix Uncaria Tomentosae: Informative Literature by Klaus Keplinger" by the title of "Der Krallendorn Tee": 
<blockquote>"The active substances in the Cat's Claw Tea are alkaloids, which occur in the plant and its watery extract as a complex bound to tannins. In this form, only little of them can be activated. The complexes get split by the acidic milieu of the stomach; the alkaloids get transformed into their hydrochloride form and, in this way, get well absorbed."</blockquote></p>
<p>   It is well known that plants containing both alkaloids and tannins form complexes that Keplinger refers to which eliminate their bioavailability. Therefore, any health promoting benefits of these phytochemicals are not realized because they are not absorbed. Many herbalists will not combine different plants with active constituents of both alkaloidal and/or tannic forms in a herbal formula for this reason.</p>
<p>   Many Cat's Claw extracts are dark red to dark reddish-brown and consumers incorrectly believe that "the darker the color, the more concentrated the extract." This is not true! A darker Cat's Claw extract means more tannin is present and beneficial alkaloids are locked up with tannins, which have formed a non-bioavailable and poorly absorbed complex.</p>
<p>   When a concentrated liquid herbal extract is taken by mouth, the active ingredients are absorbed in the mouth, throat and upper stomach and very little reaches the lower stomach and the stomach acid.   Consumers believe that sublingual absorption of these extracts will expedite the active constituents to become absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream. However, with these other high tannin extracts this is not correct. The sublingual absorption of Cat's   Claw alkaloid-tannin complexes greatly reduces bioavailability and the benefits and desired results that the alkaloids can provide.</p>
<p>   CATS CLAW FORTE Drops are very different than all other liquid extracts. In addition to developing and utilizing a proprietary extraction method, it utilizes organic apple vinegar in place of water or alcohol. This natural acid releases the alkaloids from the tannins and very little tannin is extracted. This makes the extracted alkaloids 100% bioavailable, which can be evidenced in the light golden color of Life Plus CATS CLAW FORTE Drops. For this reason also, the assayed alkaloid content of CATS CLAW FORTE Drops is 4-6 times higher than other available water/glycerin or alcohol extracts, which for the most part aren't bioavailable, and provides 10 milligrams of pure bioavailable oxindole alkaloids per 30 drops. Using vinegar in the process not only releases the alkaloids from the tannins, it actually extracts more alkaloids.</p>

<h2>NEW PROCESS - SYNERGISTIC EFFECT</h2>
<p>  The immune system is equally involved in many other protective processes in the body.  These include its response to allergy producing substances, controlling the rate and aspects of aging, protection from free radicals and protection against degenerative diseases such as arthritis, cancer, arteriosclerosis and others. Probably the most well understood and studied is allergies and cancer.  Nutritionally supporting the immune system with natural substances like alkoxyglycerols has much more value than just helping the body fight off infections.</p>

<h2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>   Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest tribes. CATS CLAW FORTE Drops, of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, reveals the ancient secrets to improved immune function, preventing inflammation and supporting energy.</p>

<h2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</h2>
 <p>  The herbal extracts in CATS CLAW FORTE Drops have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Only the alkaloid-rich inner bark is utilized.  The alkaloids and phytochemicals in the inner bark are almost identical to those found in the root of Cat's Claw and harvesting this way preserves the plant and provides for the future of the rainforest. Life Plus does not endorse harvesting Cat's Claw root and endangering our future supply of this important plant. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting sustainable natural resources, including plants found in Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</p>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<h2>HOW T0 USE CATS CLAW FORTE DROPS</h2>
<p>   Take one dropperful (30 drops) once or twice a day. During times of special need, dosages can be increased to two dropperfuls two to three times per day.   Each dropperful contains approximately 30 drops.  Each 2 ounce bottle of CATS CLAW FORTE Drops contains approximately 60 dropperfuls.  For maximum absorption and bioavailibility, do not dilute in water or juice.</p>
