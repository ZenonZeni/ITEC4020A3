Attorney?</B></FONT></FONT>
<H3>Does this seem familiar?
</H3><P>It starts out seeming simple.  You have an auto accident, and the
insurance adjuster for the at-fault driver is really friendly and helpful
so you begin working with her about getting payment for your car.  You don't
feel like you get top dollar, and you were kind of mad that they didn't pay
all of your rental car bill, but you figure you'll make up for it later when
you settle your injury claim.
<P>You decide to go it alone and negotiate a settlement of your injury claim,
so you talk with a friend who was in an accident last year, and you pick
up one of the books that are out on the market about handling your own injury
claim.  That should be all you need.
<P>The insurance company wants you to give them a recorded statement, and
you're not sure if that's right, but you go ahead.  Then some issues come
up about PIP coverage, and calculating your lost wages. Next thing you know,
the insurance company wants you to be examined by a doctor they choose. You're
not certain what to do, but you figure it will all work out in the end, so
you go ahead, but then they tell you that they won't pay any more of your
medical bills.
<P>After a couple of months your back still hurts some, but you want to settle
and get this behind you.  The medical bills keep coming, and you are getting
past due notices, so you get the insurance company to make you an offer.
 Then it occurs to you that you have a lot of nagging concerns, and don't
know where to turn.
<UL><LI>Should I settle now even though my back still hurts?
<LI>What about future medical bills?
<LI>What if I miss more work when I have to go back to physical therapy?
<LI>Was it right that the adjuster told me they didn't have to pay for my
chiropractic care?
<LI>What happens if I sign this form called a "Release?"
<LI>Is the amount of money the insurance company offers me fair?
</UL><H4><B>That is why numerous auto accident victims have used Michaelsen
Mix &amp; Rodrigues, L.L.C. </B>
</H4><P>Auto accident claims can be complex. It is often to your advantage
to have an attorney handling your claim who is knowledgeable in this type
of claim and who can advise you about how to protect your rights. Without
an attorney, you run the risk of making serious and costly mistakes.
<H4><B>What can Michaelsen Mix &amp; Rodrigues, L.L.C. do for you?

</H4><UL><LI>Evaluate your bodily injury claim to determine the amount of

<LI>Relieve you of much of the worry, inconvenience and paperwork involved

<LI>Lay the groundwork for a good settlement, and avoid mistakes before they
are made.
<LI>Resolve complex issues. Our firm is aware of what state laws apply.
<LI>Work with your doctors to  obtain your medical records, reports &amp;
billing statements, and notify medical providers who to bill.
<LI>When necessary, have our investigator immediately interview witnesses,
take  statements from the investigating police officer, and take photographs
of the accident scene.
<LI>Skillfully negotiate a maximum fair settlement for you.
<LI>File a lawsuit and present your claim to a jury, if necessary. Using
this leverage with the insurance company can add to the value of your claim.
