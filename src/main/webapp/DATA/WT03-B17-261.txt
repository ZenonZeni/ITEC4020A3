<STRONG><H1>Compost Production</H1></STRONG>
     Using  rock dust in compost production increases its energy  level
by  adding  minerals,  and  increasing the activity  of  bacteria.  The
increased  bacteria stimulates the composting process.  Rock dust  also
helps  heat up the compost pile. Add a thin layer of rock dust  to  the
compost  pile,  alternating between layers of grass clippings,  manure,
kitchen  wastes,  etc., Water as needed. As rock dust  has a high PH
level,  use small amounts and add something acidic like leaves or  pine
needles. Never add chemicals to the compost. To lower PH level if it is
too  high,  add one quart vinegar with five gallons water and  sprinkle
over pile once per week.See chapter on compost for more information.

<STRONG><H2>Pest Control</H2></STRONG>
     Rock  dust  is  also very effective in controlling pests  such  as
snails,  because of its high silica content (67%). Dust  lightly  around
the garden, allow to sit for 24 hours, then  water  well.

<STRONG><H2>
</H2></STRONG>On Trees
     Trees  also  love rock dust. Always use small amounts  as  the  PH
level  can irritate high acid based trees. A large tree should be given
four  coffee  cans full of rock dust spread evenly beneath its  canopy,
starting two feet from the trunk to ten feet past the furthest reach of
its  branches. Sprinkle evenly then spray down with hose. Use a  garden
filter to filter out the chlorine from the water.

<STRONG><H2>In The Garden</H2></STRONG>
     Dust  around  the  vegetable plants, allow to sit overnight,  then
spray down with filtered water. Mix into a liquid form and add seaweed.
Spray this on the plants leaves, this increases the energy level of the
plants,  assisting  them  in  fighting off  pests.  Use  peat  moss  or
composted  aged  wood to maintain a balanced PH level. Your  vegetables
will  have  increased  mineral and vitamin content  and  will  be  more
nutritious.

<STRONG><H2>For the Lawn</H2></STRONG>
     When  used  on lawns , rock dust will increase color and encourage
deeper root systems. Using rock dust will decrease your need to add any
high  nitrogen  .  Rock  dust will also increase the  effectiveness  of
compost applications. Add 50 pounds of rock dust per 1,000 square  feet
of lawn. Apply twice yearly.  After dusting lawn, water well. Take care
not to breathe in the rock dust when you are dusting your garden, lawn,
trees, etc.
