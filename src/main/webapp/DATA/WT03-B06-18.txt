CONTE AND HIS REFORMS LOOK SECURE

     Allowing opposition parties and a partially free press,
President Lansana Conte has engineered both his own presidential
election in 1993 and a Parliament controlled by his party in June
1995.  Despite the widespread opposition he has stimulated, none of
the forces arrayed against him control enough resources to topple
him.  The most serious threats to his continuing in office are poor
health or assassination.  In case of unexpected economic decline or
if the opposition is able to put aside its differences and unite, a
national conference could emerge that leads to a civilian regime.
Despite past military involvement in politics, a coup is unlikely.
Conte will continue to support limited austerity and liberalization
measures and the economy is expected to improve as a result of more
raw material exports, especially an improvement in the current
account.  A national conference regime would spend more but would
liberalize the economy.  A military government would limit
liberalization.

CHRONOLOGY:  GUINEA

March 31, 1995      The Interior Ministry announced that the long-
                    delayed parliamentary elections would take place
                    on June 11.

May 16, 1995        A monthly shipping service opened between Conakry
                    and Lagos, Nigeria.

June 2, 1995        Soldiers arrested approximately 100 members of
                    Alpha Conde's RPG party.  The arrests took place
                    in the north, near Mandiana, as RPG supporters
                    headed to a rally.

June 11, 1995       The ruling Party for Unity and Progress captured
                    71 seats in legislative elections, while
                    opposition parties won 38 seats.

June 21, 1995       Employees of six private banks launched a strike
                    for higher wages, training, and better working
                    conditions.

August 9, 1995      Five armed robbers were sentenced to death
                    following a trial of more than 70 people
                    broadcast on national television and radio.

August 28, 1995     President Conte, during a broadcast in his native
                    Soussou language, said there would be no
                    extraparliamentary dialogue with the CODEM
                    alliance of opposition parties.

August 30, 1995     Opposition deputies of the CODEM alliance, formed
                    in July, participated in the installation of the
                    new National Assembly despite a boycott threat.
                    Alpha Conde, however, was absent.

September 15, 1995  Seven Guinea soldiers were killed in Sierra Leone
                    by Sierra Leone rebels.  The deaths were the
                    first in the Guinean deployment.
