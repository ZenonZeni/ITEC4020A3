Although the CDA has been found  unconstitutional by a Philadelphia 
Federal Court, the fight for free speech online is only just beginning.  
The government is widely expected to appeal the case to the Supreme 
Court.  If you haven't done so already, please take a moment to join the 
Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) by filling out the form 
below. Join over 47,000 of your fellow netizens in showing the court, the 
press, and Congress that the Internet community stands behind its ideals...

<p>
<h3>What is the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition?</h3>
<p>
The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC - pronounced "seek") is a 
coalition of Internet users, businesses, non-profit organizations and civil 
liberties advocates formed to challenge the constitutionality of the 
Communications Decency Act because they believe it violates their free
speech rights and condemns the Internet to a future of burdensome
censorship and government intrusion. <p>
<h3>How Can I Help Protect the Internet and the Future of Free Speech in the Information Age?</h3>
<p>
You can participate in a landmark effort that will determine the fate of the Internet and the future of free expression in the Information Age.
<p>
Every user of the Internet is a content provider under the Communications Decency Act (CDA) and could be subject to fines and prison sentences under the new law. If you post messages to an open listserv, Usenet newsgroups, participate in IRC or chat sessions, or maintain your own personal Web Page, ftp or gopher archive, you may be subject to fines up to $250,000 or 2 years in prison under the CDA if someone, somewhere, finds the material you post to be "indecent" or 'patently offensive".
<p>
If you are concerned about the impact of the Communications Decency Act, you can join the fight to overturn it.  Join the CIEC today! 
<p>
<h3>Instructions for Joining the CIEC</h3>
<p>
Joining the CIEC as an individual Internet user is a simple as filling out the form below. Individual CIEC members will also be invited to join a private listserv for announcements and status reports on the progress of the case.
<p>
<h3>Statement of CIEC Principals</h3>
<p>
As an individual user of the of the Internet, I join the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition to challenge the Communications Decency Act because I believe in:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting the continued development of the Internet as a forum for the 
free exchange of valuable information and ideas.
<p>
<li>Promoting the ability of parents and other individual users to 
supervise and assist their children in accessing the wealth of 
information resouces available on this global communications medium, 
free from government censorship.
</ul>
<p>
As an individual user of the Internet, I am subject to the restrictions 
imposed by the Communications Decency Act. While it is clear that I am 
subject to criminal penalties under this law, I neither understand what 
materials would be illegal nor how I can avoid prosecution.  
<p>
I believe that the CDA will restrict my rights to free speech under the 
United States Constitution and destroy the Internet as a viable means of 
free expression, education, and commerce.
