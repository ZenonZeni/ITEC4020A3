<H2>Dwarf Elephants Invade San Diego!  Film at 11</H2>

<p>SAN DIEGO - It's funny.  Just the other day, on one of the listservs I subscribe to, we were talking about the sci-fi novel <i>Footfall</i> - which, if you haven't read it, is about an invasion of Earth by a race of intelligent miniature elephants who'd actually be kind of cute and comical if they weren't trying to enslave humanity.
<p>And here I am now, at the 1996 Republican National convention, watching as San Diego is invaded by a race of intelligent miniature elephants who'd actually be kind of cute and comical if they weren't trying to - 
<p>Naaah.  Cheap shot.  I promise, no more elephant jokes for the duration of the convention.
<p>Still, there is a certain science-fiction aspect to the whole thing.  Political conventions and sci-fo cons are a lot alike - both, for example, are full of people who wear outlandish clothes, have geeky conversations no one else can follow, and spend lots of time thinking about screwing and getting screwed.  Literally <i>and</i> figuratively, in the case of political conventions.
<p>Even the San Diego Convention Center looks like the ancient remains of a crashed alien spacecraft - either that, or an all-Plexiglas Nazarene church from the early 1980s.  In any event, it's an otherworldy spectacle.
<hr>
<p>A few words about San Diego.
<p>This city is Republican Heaven.  Not the Biblical kind, with puffy white clouds and angels in gossamer robes and jukeboxes with nothing but songs by Pat Boone and Marie Osmond - the Christian Coalition can have that one (although they might have to go north to Escondido and duke it out with Pat Buchanan to get it).  No, the Republicans who own this town have more earthly concerns, and they've realized them here, in the Happy Hunting Ground of middle-of-the-road conservatism: the city government is in bed with big business, the local media have been lulled into sun-dried complacency, and the poor and minorities do nothing that interferes with profits - for which, in exchange, they are largely left alone.  The cops here have the scary paramilitary strut typical of most SoCal police departments, but they're laid-back about it - they're not racists like in L.A., they just have a lot of rich people to protect.
<p>As far as Republicans go, the most prominent one with roots in San Diego is the former mayor, the aggressively bland Pete Wilson.  That says it all, pretty much.
<hr>
<p>A few fun facts: Several dozen sign-language interpreters will be working in shifts during the convention, either at several stations throughout the convention hall or roving the floor on call for conferences or caucuses.  All of the convention materials - and I mean all of it, we're talking truckloads of paper, here - are being transcribed onto audiotape or computer disk or into braille.  The convention hall itself has been fitted with portable elevators at each corner so that wheelchair users can reach the skyboxes or the upper tier of the bleachers.
The 1996 election could very well be a critical one for persons with disabilities.  The fact that the GOP's Presidential candidate is a gimp has made the party ultra-sensitive on the issue.  If a delegate gets his wheelchair stuck in a toilet stall, and then goes complaining to CNN about it, the GOP will be really embarrassed.
<p>But don't worry.  If I can't take a piss, you'll hear it here first.
