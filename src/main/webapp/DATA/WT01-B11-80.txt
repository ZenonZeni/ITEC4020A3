        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Molloy Parent-Child Center </h3>
        <p>One out of every 400 babies born in the United States
        suffers a significant hearing loss. Often, medical
        science cannot identify the cause of deafness, let alone
        prevent or cure it. </p>
        <p>The diagnosis of a child's deafness is a most painful
        time for parents, but also the time of greatest hope. The
        earlier a child's residual hearing is stimulated by
        speech, the faster and further language skills progress. </p>
        <p>That is why, in 1981, St. Joseph Institute for the
        Deaf established its Molloy Parent-Child Center. The
        Center works exclusively with young children from birth
        to five years of age, offering formative language therapy
        in the auditory/oral philosophy. The Center also helps
        hearing children who have delayed speech and language. </p>
        <p>But this is truly a parent-child program. Parents are
        supported and counseled as they cope with the normal
        range of emotions and demands accompanying their child's
        diagnosis. The Center's staff instructs parents in their
        role as the child's first and most important teachers of
        language. </p>
        <p>For toddlers up to age three, parents and children
        attend weekly one-hour sessions together in the Molloy
        Center. Parents learn to assist the child in developing
        auditory-verbal communication skills through social,
        motor and cognitive activities which the parents can
        continue at home. Additional sessions are conducted with
        the child and therapist to reinforce and expand the
        language growth. </p>
        <p>Children ages two to three attend the Center's Nursery
        program in very small groups or private sessions to
        receive age-appropriate therapy. SJI's pediatric
        audiological services are available to all Molly Center
        children. </p>
        <p>Molly's setting is distinct and purposeful. In a
        quaint stone cottage on the wooded campus of St.
        Joseph's, the Center is a small replica of a home,
        featuring a kitchen, bedroom and family room. This warm,
        home-like setting is comforting to children and parents
        alike. But it also serves an important learning function
        by allowing the infants to associate concepts and sounds
        with the object and environment of their homes. </p>
        <p>The Molloy Center has helped more than 500 children
        and their parents lay the early, critical foundation for
        future listening and speaking skills. How important can
        this type of program be to a child? </p>
        <p>In 1993, the National Institutes of Health determined
        that early detection of a hearing loss and immediate
        language therapy such as that offered by the Molloy
        Center can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>increase the child's high school reading level by
                four grades, and</li>
            <li>increase the student's lifetime earning power by
                as much as $800,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Molloy Parent-Child Center was founded by Sr.
        Arline Eveld, M.Ed., P.Dipl., who, in developing this
        model program, drew upon her 30 years of training and
        experience in deaf education and the Institute's 150
        years of success in helping deaf children. </p>
        <p>The Molloy Center annually provides evaluation and
        referral services to hundreds of parents throughout the
        nation, assisting them in identifying the professional
        and educational options available for their children. </p>
        <p>Those wishing to contact the Molloy Center by
        telephone can do so through St. Joseph's or by calling
        the Center directly at (314)991-3773. </p>
