<H3>Opening Doors: Housing Needs And Housing Policy:An Analysis Of The Impact Of "Elderly Only" Designated Housing Policies</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>It seems clear that any federal housing policy, if it is to be based on documented housing needs, fairness, and an equitable distribution of resources, must address the critical and increasing shortage of housing for people with disabilities.  During the past few years, despite their documented worst case housing needs, the direction of federal housing policy regarding very low income people with disabilities has been to dramatically reduce, rather than to expand, the supply of federally funded subsidized housing available to them.

<P>Since 1992, tenant selection policies governing all efficiency and one-bedroom HUD subsidized housing resources in assisted and public housing programs (so-called elderly housing) have been modified to exclude or reduce the number of people with disabilities who are eligible and to permit housing providers to designate "elderly only" housing.  Through the implementation of Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, and Section 10 of the Housing Opportunities Program Extension Act of 1996, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that the number of federally assisted housing units available to people with disabilities in HUD's public and assisted housing may be reduced by 40-50% or more during the next five years. 

<P>
<h4>The Loss Of Federally Subsidized Housing For People With Disabilities</h4>
<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has used HUD 1995 occupancy data to estimate the impact of designated housing policies on the distribution of HUD assisted and public housing units. Assuming a very conservative unit turnover rate of 8% per year, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that between 1994 and the year 2000, 62,250 of the 117,000 units of HUD assisted housing previously occupied by people with disabilities will eventually be occupied by elderly households - a reduction of 53%.  For HUD public housing, the CCD Housing Task Force assumed the same 8% turnover rate but applied it only prospectively from the year 1996 through the year 2000.  Based on these assumptions, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that 45,000 of the 112,500 units of HUD public housing currently occupied by people with disabilities will be occupied by elderly households by the year 2000 - a reduction of 40%.

<P>The table above clearly illustrates that elderly households benefit significantly from "elderly only" designated housing policies, since the supply of housing lost to younger people with disabilities represents an increase in the supply of subsidized housing available for households age 62 and over.  Elderly only designated housing policies result in elderly households increasing their utilization of public and assisted housing by more than 10% - an increase in supply of 120,750 units.  This shift in supply away from people with disabilities and to elderly households comes at a time when, according to HUD's <i>1994 Worst Case Housing Needs Report, </i>"[e]lderly families and individuals were <i>least</i> likely to have worst case needs (34%) and most likely to live in public or assisted housing (36%)."

<P>The shift of federally subsidized housing resources away from the group identified as having the highest incidence of worst case needs, to the group identified as having the lowest percentage of worst case needs, raises serious public policy issues regarding the impact of designated housing policies and the allocation of future federal housing resources.   Moreover, these statistics do not take into consideration the thousands of people with disabilities who were on public and assisted housing waiting lists and who would otherwise have been assisted were it not for designated housing policies.  

<P>
<H4>Adverse Impact On Housing Waiting Lists</H4>
<P>Because HUD does not collect data on the Public Housing Authority (PHA) or assisted housing waiting lists, it is difficult to estimate the number of people with disabilities on waiting lists that have been, or will be, displaced by "elderly only" designated housing policies.  However, the CCD Housing Task Force has used very conservative assumptions to estimate that at least 163,664 people with disabilities will be displaced from waiting lists due to designated housing policies, including 92,820 from HUD assisted housing lists, and 70,844 from public housing lists.

<P>During the "mixing" debate in 1992, PHA officials testified before Congress that one-third to one-half of the households on public housing waiting lists were people with disabilities under age 62.  Given the fact that there are approximately 537,000 units of  public housing for elderly and disabled households, it is reasonable to assume that PHA waiting lists contain at least that number of households, and that one third, or 162,878, are people with disabilities.  Assuming turnover of 8% per year over a five year period, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that 70,844 people with disabilities currently on waiting lists will be deprived of public housing units due to designated housing policies.  [See <a href="/housing/appendix.htm">Appendix</a>]

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has also estimated the impact of designated housing policies on HUD assisted housing waiting lists using slightly different assumptions. Unlike public housing, HUD assisted housing developments operate with project based lists.  As a result, people with disabilities have had more difficulty accessing these units, and their representation on waiting lists is undoubtedly lower.  Assuming that the total number of people on assisted housing waiting lists is at least equal to the total number of units available (663,000), that 25% of the waiting list is made up of people with disabilities, and a turnover rate of 8% since 1994, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that 92,820 people with disabilities who were on HUD assisted housing waiting lists have been displaced due to designated housing policies. [See <a href="/housing/appendix.htm"> Appendix</a>]

<P>
Taken together, the data on the loss of housing units previously occupied by people with disabilities through turnover, and the loss of housing due to waiting list displacement, results in a conservative estimated loss of 273,954 federally subsidized housing units for people with disabilities.  This substantial loss of housing opportunity, which is a direct result of recent federal housing policies,  requires an immediate response from the federal government.
