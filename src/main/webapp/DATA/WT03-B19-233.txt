<P>
The value of tourism exports has almost doubled in the past decade, rising from 
6% of total export earnings in 1983-84 to 12% in 1993-94. The number of foreign 
tourist visits to Australia has increased at an average annual rate of 8% over 
the past eight years to the current annual level of three million.
<P>
Spending by foreign tourists in Australia in 1994-95 will be around $7 billion.
Sales to foreigners by Australian transport operators will be an additional $2.5
 billion. Foreign tourism will contribute just over 2% of national GDP compared
with domestic tourist spending of $15 billion or 3% of GDP.
<P>
The rapid growth of foreign tourism began with a decline in the Australian dollar in the mid 1980s and has benefited from economic expansion in Asia and improved marketing by the Australian tourism industry.
<P>
More tourist visits are originating from Asia. Japan is the major source of tourists (30% of the total). Other Asian countries now account for 25% of the total.
 The number of tourists from New Zealand, Europe and North America is rising more slowly.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</I></B>
<P>
Spending by foreign and interstate tourists in Victoria is around $2.3 billion or 2% of Gross State Product. Spending by foreign tourists accounts for 40% of the total and domestic tourism makes up the remaining 60%.
<P>
In 1993-94, Victoria attracted 800,000 visitors from overseas and two million 
visitors from other Australian states. Foreign tourist visits have grown 
consistently faster than domestic tourism since the mid 1980s.
<P>
Victoria has over 30,000 hotel and motel rooms. Takings from accommodation in 
Victoria in 1993-94 were $432 million, almost three times the level of ten 
years ago.
<P>
Investment in the tourism sector in Victoria has rebounded and is set to increase further over the next few years. The construction of the Melbourne Casino hotel and other new tourism-related projects and events such as the Grand Prix will see investment activity return to high levels during 1995 and 1996.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</I></B>
<P>
The Bureau of Tourism Research forecasts tourist visits to average growth of 7%
over the rest of the 1990s and reach six million by the year 2000.
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics has forecast spending by foreign tourists in 
Australia to average growth over the period to 2005-6 of 8%.
<P>
Rapid economic growth in Asia is expected to be the main driving force behind 
the expected growth in tourism.
