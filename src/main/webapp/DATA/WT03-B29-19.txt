industry in dealing with the varied and complex problems of handling
hazardous wastes.
   The book has fourteen chapters and six appendixes. The chapters cover
the following topics: Introduction to hazardous wastes; toxicology and risk
assessment; environmental legislation and regulations; hazardous waste
characterization, sampling, and analysis; pollution prevention and waste
minimization; chemical and physical treatment; biological treatment;
thermal processes; treatment process and facility siting; transportation
and storage of hazardous wastes; groundwater contamination; landfill and
injection well disposal; environmental audits and site assessment; and site
remediation.
   The topics included in the appendixes are: Priority pollutants;
hazardous wastes from nonspecific sources; hazardous wastes from specific
sources; listing of EPA hazardous wastes from commercial chemical products,
intermediates, and residues; useful conversion factors; and periodic chart
of elements, atomic numbers, and atomic weights.
   Most of the chapters contain questions or problems, and all have fairly
up-to-date bibliographies. Many, especially the ones on treatment
processes, contain much useful information.

ENVIRONMENTAL FIRMS REACT TO A COOLER MARKET
New demands, slower growth, and uncertainty are reshaping environmental
services

By:
Nicholas Basta, with David Veasey

MERGERS SIGNAL INCREASED COMPETITITON

In response to customers' demands for consolidated services, more companies
have been joining forces. Some linkages have been between two
environmental service firms. Others, such as Fluor's merger with
Groundwater Technology, allied an environmental remediation specialist with
$178 million in 1995 revenues, with an expert in engineering and
construction whose revenues last year topped $8.5 billion. Dow Radian
(Austin, Tex.), Dow's merger with Radian, similarly, combined two companies
with different areas of expertise. The company expects some $400 million
in bookings this year.
   Other acquisitions and mergers colored the U.S environmental services
market last year. OHM Inc. (Findley, Ohio), for example, expanded its
hazardous-waste remediation business by acquiring the hazwaste and radwaste
divisions of Rust International, a subsidiary of WMX Technologies (Oak
Brook, Ill.). As part of the deal, WMX will own part of OHM.

In addition:
-- Geraghty & Miller (Plainview, N.Y.) bought Piedmont Olsen Hensley, a
Greenville, S.C., E&C firm.
-- Earth Tech (Long Beach, Calif.) bought Barett Consulting Group (Menlo
Park, Calif.), a water and infrastructure firm.
-- Roy F. Weston (West Chester, Pa.) formed a partnership with The Eicon
Group, a bioremediation firm in New Haven, Conn.
-- Tetra Tech, Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.) bought PRC Environmental Management
(Alexandria, Va.).
-- Allwaste (Houston) bought Ecova Corp.'s In-Plant Service business.
-- Thermo Remediation Inc. (Waltham, Mass.) plans to buy Remediation
Technologies, Inc. (Concord, Mass.) for $33.3 million. Thermo Process
Systems bought Lancaster Laboratories (Lancaster, Pa.) for about $25
million. r



Even though their revenues set records last year, environmental equipment
and services companies know that the days of double digit U.S. market
growth are over. For one thing, their business has matured, and, as CPI
plants better control and reduce their emissions, there is a less urgent
need for their products.
   In addition, customers' demands are becoming more sophisticated. 
Instead of asking for simple environmental project management, downsized
government agencies and companies now want a full array of consulting
resources to help them stay competitive. ``Our clients want help managing
the whole problem, not just effluents at the end of the pipe,'' says Ellen
Leinfuss, vice-president for marketing for Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.
(Branchburg, N.J.), which is moving into an integrated environmental and
resource-management position.
    In response, more companies in the environmental sector are linking up
with each other, or with engineering and construction firms, to meet
changing needs in a future that still looks unclear (Box, p. 39). The trend
to ``one stop'' consulting is evidenced by last quarter's merger between
Radian Corp. (Austin, Tex.) and Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, Mich.),
combining process design and remediation knowhow. Similarly, last month's
merger between Fluor Daniel, Inc. (Irvine, Calif.) and Groundwater
Technology, Inc. (GTI; Norwood, Mass.) united engineering and construction
with remediation expertise. As Walter Barber, president of the new
company, Fluor Daniel/GTI, explains, the merger came mainly in response to
the changing needs of the U.S. Dept. of Defense (Washington, D.C.), a major
force in the soil remediation market. ``They want to deal with engineering
companies much larger than most environmental firms.''

Market growth slows
No doubt, slowing market growth is also helping to shape environmental
equipment and service companies' strategies. As more of their business
segments top out, conditions will soon become cutthroat if the current
trends continue. Take the flat, but sizeable, $9-billion market for soil
and groundwater remediation. If demand dips to $8 billion, says Barber,
``We'll see a real identification of winners and losers.''
   Clearly, U.S. demand for environmental products and services sector has
been increasing, but, since 1993, its growth has been slowing, and it has
been shrinking as a percentage of capital spending. In its 1995 member
survey, the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Assn. (CMA; Washington, D.C.) found
that, while overall capital spending increased by 25% between 1993 and
1996, spending on the environment dropped from 16.8% of all capital
spending in 1993 to 13.3% last year. In 1996, members expect it to drop to
10% of spending.
   Some analysts see the U.S. environmental market doing only about one
percentage point better than the overall economy. Between 1993 and 1998,
growth should stand at 3.9%/yr, with overall revenues moving from $133.5 to
$162.1 billion (Table, p. 39), according to Environmental Business
International (EBI; San Diego, Calif.).
   One standout among types of pollution spending has been air pollution
control, although EBI notes that growth has been slowing and revenues
declining since 1993. Last year, the analysts say, the market totalled $12
billion, as opposed to $13.5 billion for water pollution control equipment
and chemicals. Between 1993 and 1994, demand grew by 1.7%, and it should
continue at 2% until 1998.
   In the air-pollution-control equipment segment, volatile organic
compound (VOC) recovery systems, particularly regenerative thermal
oxidizers, have been a stellar product, according to Bob McIlvaine,
president of The McIlvaine Co. (Northbrook, Ill.). Demand for the units,
which burn flammable VOCs, sometimes with the use of supplemental natural
gas, has gone from $8 million to over $350 million.

Exports: uncharted territory
An unexplored market for many U.S. companies is exports, according to EBI. 
``The very size of the U.S. market has bred complacency and an
unwillingness to expand beyond U.S. borders,'' notes EBI president, Grant
Ferrier. In addition, management of water, sewage, and other municipal
works has not been privatized in the U.S. Other factors, he says, are lack
of sufficient market intelligence and government support, although the
picture is starting to change (p. 46).
   A closer look at the numbers shows that hazardous waste management and
waste management equipment will shrink during the five-year period. The
stand-out growth prospect is ``process and prevention technology,''
expected to leap by 15% -- but from $800 million, the smallest base of any
of the categories analyzed.
   Combined, resource recovery -- primarily municipal waste incineration --
and environmental energy sources, including biomass and other alternative
energy sources, will grow from just over $17 billion to $23 billion in
1998. While this growth is respectable, it wasn't so long ago that
forecasts called for municipal waste incineration to reach the $100-billion
mark by the year 2000.
   Meanwhile, the hazardous waste disposal sector is bearing the brunt of
pollution prevention efforts, with disposed volumes having declined now for
several years. ``There are fewer regulatory drivers to waste disposal that
fueled the industry growth in the 1980s, and the tremendous emphasis on
waste reduction has impacted our landfill and incineration facilities,''
says Kevin Igli, vice president for environmental management at Chemical
Waste Management, a subisidiary of WMX Technologies, Inc. (Oak Brook,
Ill.).
   But, reflecting the current trend, CWM, too, is getting into the waste
reduction business, he says. ``Previously, we simply picked up the waste at
the plant gate; now, we're going into the plant to help companies develop
waste- reduction schemes.''
   Igli also sees a potentially dramatic change looming in proposed rules
from EPA concerning waste definitions and delisting. A new Hazardous Waste
Identification Rule (HWIR) has been issued that combines risk analysis with
chemical analysis of waste streams, along with a strategy for treatment.
``Waste generators will be in a position of trying to decide whether they
want to handle qualified materials as industrial, rather than hazardous,
waste streams, and deciding what level of treatment they want.''
   If more wastes get delisted, and sent to regular landfills rather than
secured hazwaste fills, the business could take another hit. But the same
companies might be expanding their waste-treatment operations, or their
analytical and consulting work.

Regulatory uncertainty's a factor
Looming in the background is the antiregulatory climate in Washington that
has been intensifying since Republicans gained control of Congress in late
1994. While there shouldn't be a dramatic drop in environmental spending,
and most observers say companies will still have to meet existing or
tougher standards, Congress has been sending clear signals that it wants
regulators off industry's back, and chemical manufacturing companies aren't
complaining. ``Our members continue to find that you get back only about 10
cents on the dollar invested in environmental activity,'' notes Alan Lenz,
chief economist for the U.S. Chemical Manufacturing Assn. (CMA; Washington,
D.C.). And this, he says, takes into account lower disposal costs,
recovered byproducts and other benefits.
   Instead of celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Washington, D.C.) spent a good part
of last year worrying about its survival. Only a veto by President
Clinton in December saved its enforcement budget from a 21% funding cut
that, according to assistant EPA administrator Fred Hanson, would have left
it ``unable to ensure continued protection of the environment.''
   At a time when Clean Air Act amendments call for hiring new enforcement
personnel, EPA has had to cut staff. ``We have to do more with less, but
the solution is to work smarter [and not simply cut funding],'' Hanson told
CE at a press conference at the Environmental Champions awards (CE,
November, p. 54) presentation in New York last month.
   Overshadowing Congressional debate has been some nasty confrontation
over the budget, and the drive for a balanced budget by 2002. One way that
Republican legislators have made their views known is by sponsoring riders
on budget bills or other unrelated legislation. So far, they have proposed
such measures as stopping EPA review of Army Corps of Engineers' wetlands
permitting, preventing expansion of the Toxics Release Inventory, and
delaying application of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)
air-emission standards for petroleum refiners. These and other riders
continuously appeared during the summer and fall despite a House vote to
omit riders from agency appropriations. However, this year, MACT standards
are expected to be issued for air emissions from refineries.
   Another potential blow to environmental enforcement was the passage last
year of the Unfunded Mandates bill. By blocking enforcement programs whose
funding has not already been assured by individual state budgets, the bill
could have a significant impact on a number of environmental regulations.

Legislation in limbo
At the same time, key pieces of legislation remain suspended in Congress,
and it is still too soon to tell whether Superfund, the Safe Drinking Water
Act, the Clean Water Act, or Regulatory Reform will pass next year. The
Clean Water Act (CWA) reauthorization bill (H.R. 961) passed the House last
spring, but is hung up in the Senate as debate continues over non-point
pollution sources, and whether the agricultural sector should be included.
Eventually, CWA could become primarily an enforcement program.
   For Superfund, the big sticking point is retroactive liability, while
the Safe Drinking Water Act, once bolstered by bipartisan support, has also
run into objections. A Senate reauthorization bill has been called ``one
large, unfunded mandate'' by critics, who expect it to double or triple the
costs of water systems nationally. Although the bill has been passed by
the House, it remains stalled in the Senate.
   The Takings Bill, which would have the government pay landowners whose
property is devalued because of regulations, was approved by the House and
has passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Endangered Species Act
reauthorization, which would cut protective regulation, has been passed by
the House, but has not yet been acted upon by the Senate.
   Industry representatives and conservative policymakers who support
Republican-sponsored environmental regulatory reform say that their goals
are to rationalize environmental policies in an age of limited public
resources. ``We seek to streamline the process, to make it less oppressive
and wasteful,'' says Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum
Institute (Washington, D.C.), in a speech at the association's annual
meeting last November.
   Clinton Administration officials use similar reformatory terms in
describing their goals, but draw a line at EPA funding. ``Congressional
proposals to slash EPA budgets are absolutely unacceptable,'' says Elaine
Kamarck, senior policy advisor to Vice President Al Gore. The key to
effective policy, she adds, is making enforcement more selective by
identifying problem generators, and emphasizing compliance, rather than
``ticket-writing.''
   Many in the environmental business are calling for more-rational
environmental planning, grounded in economic reality. ``There [are more
than enough] laws on the books for protecting the environment,'' says Fluor
Daniel/GTI's president Barber. ``Over the next five years, we should shift
away from regulatory, and toward economic, drivers.''
   The current regulatory climate could help foster useful activities, he
says. Among examples he cites are recovering value by reclaiming
chemicals, either from waste streams or as part of pollution-prevention
programs, using remediated sites, or ``brownfields'' for industrial
purposes, rather than restoring them to pristine conditions, and reducing
liability for insurance purposes.
   Environmentalists, meanwhile, are gravely concerned about the fallout
from the Republican agenda. ``[Reform is] a blatant repeal of environmental
protections that would provide many opportunities for legal challenges, and
would tie regulations up in bureaucratic red tape,'' says John Kostayack,
an attorney with the National Wildlife Federation (Washington, D.C.).

Consensus on risk assessment?
One area where some consensus is shaping up is in risk assessment and
management. EPA itself has several programs in the works to allow for
greater use of risk assessment in making priority choices in pollution
control, and in evaluating hazards.
   A risk assessment provision that would call for detailed risk versus
benefit analysis before any environmental regulation is issued, passed the
House last February as part of a regulatory reform bill (H.R. 1022). The
Senate version (S.343) has since been bottled up in committee.
Nevertheless, the House bill offers a sound scientific way to calculate
potential risk from chemicals, says Dr. George Gray, deputy director of the
Harvard University School of Public Health's Center for Risk Analysis
(Cambridge, Mass.). ``We need to get away from a single number [for
calculating risk] and consider the range of potential effects.'' EPA's
reliance on worst-case scenarios and linear dose-responses tars many
chemicals with the same brush, he says, and does nothing to allay public
fears about risk.
   Of course, it remains to be seen whether risk assessment and other key
elements of Republican reform actually wind up changing any environmental
regulations. U.S. environmental firms are not waiting to find out, though,
as they prepare to face a very different business in the future.

MOLECULAR MODELING IT'S NOT JUST FOR CHEMISTS ANYMORE
More chemical engineers are using new models to speed up product design and
testing

By:
AGNES SHANLEY
Gerald Parkinson with Ken Fouhy


Imagine dreaming up the perfect chemical product, feeding its properties
into a computer and getting, not just a model of that product, but
blueprints of the whole process for making it. Sound futuristic? It's
already happening, as more chemical engineers tap into molecular modeling
and combinatorial chemistry techniques (Box, p. 33) to speed up product
design and to avoid the costly trial and error of physical tests.
   Molecular modeling was once the exclusive domain of chemists, who apply
the concept on the microscopic, structural level. Now, chemical engineers
are modeling on the macroscopic level, examining chemical groups rather
than elements, explains Rafiqul Ghani, head of the University of Denmark's
(Lyngby) Computer Aided Molecular Design program. The results are already
showing up in better products, environmentally benign processes, and
improved equipment, at a fraction of the typical product development cost.
   This new market, in turn, is driving the development of more
user-friendly modeling packages, incorporating expert systems and extensive
databases. It has also played some part in the merger between California
based Biosym Technologies and Molecular Simulations, Inc. (MSI; Medford,
Mass.) last August. The new company, Biosym/MSI, Inc. (San Diego), is
strengthening its push outside the pharmaceutical market into new materials
development.
   Reverse engineering or ``retrosynthesis'' (CE, July, 1995, p. 33) is the
basis of molecular modeling, which starts with the concept for a new
product, then works backward to develop a way to make it.
``Computationally, this becomes very intensive,'' says Jeremy Winter,
manager of Courtaulds plc's (Coventry, U.K.) theory and modeling group,
which is applying the concept to design polymers for synthetic fibers.
   For complex molecules, which can require gigabytes of data storage
space, supercomputers are still needed, but they're no longer a
prerequisite for modeling. New packages running on workstations and even
PCs are taking modeling far beyond the laboratory.
   Illustrating the trend are two PC-based packages that will be introduced
commercially this month: Cranium (diagram, p. 31), which features a
built-in database and expert system to calculate physical properties, is
offered by Molecular Knowledge Systems (MKS; Nashua, N.H.), while
BatchDesign-Kit, a proces synthesis program for pharmaceuticals and
specialty chemicals, is offered by Gensym Corp. (Cambridge, Mass). Built
onto Gensym's G2 expert system, it allows users to optimize the
environmental performance of their processes as they do simulations and
develop flow and recipe sheets.

Environmental modeling
Such products are sure of a market, as more companies in the chemical
process industries (CPI) turn to molecular modeling to cut development
costs and time. Environmental pressures have driven many of their projects.
DuPont Co. (Wilmington, Del.), for example, used software from Gaussian,
Inc. (Pittsburgh, Pa.) and other programs to come up with routes to
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes.
   Far from research oddities, the results include such molecules as
HFC-134a, which is now in commercial production at several plants. Modeling
a typical set of thermodynamic calculations took under a week and cost
under $5,000, less than one tenth the cost of physical experiments, says
David Dixon, former research leader in computational chemistry at DuPont. 
He is now associate director for theory, modeling and simulation at
Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (Richland, Wash.), which
is modeling cleanup methods for mixed wastes containing radioactive and
chlorinated organic compounds.
   Others have used modelling to design the right catalyst for their needs.
  Catalytica, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), for example, used software
developed by Biosym/MSI to design a catalyst to eliminate unwanted
byproduct.
   Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Allentown, Pa.), which has used
molecular modeling to screen fluorinating reagents, is modeling catalysts
that will allow it to make polyethylene foam without freon. Where it
usually takes weeks to test a new chemical, modeling takes only minutes and
minimizes lab work, says Air Products engineering associate, Paul Mathias.

Modeling and equipment design
Equipment design is also poised to benefit from increased use of molecular
modeling. At Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, Mich.), chemists and chemical
engineers are using Gaussian's program to calculate heats of formation and
reaction of materials, to aid in reactor and heat exchanger design.
Meanwhile, Engineered Software Inc. (ESI; Lacey, Wash.) has just finished
beta testing Cranium to size piping and pumps for mixed fluids. MKS will
now offer the software to ESI's customers. ``Cranium makes process
simulation data available to plant designers and operators,'' says ESI
president Ray Hardee, ``and not just process simulation specialists.''
   In chemical product development, Union Carbide Corp.'s Thermophysical
Properties Skill Center (Charleston, W.Vs.) is using MKS's Synapse
molecular design program to measure vapor-liquid and other phase
equilibria, mainly to select solvents for liquid-liquid extraction or
azeotropic distillation. Shell Development Co. (Houston) is using Biosym's
Insight and Discover to develop new products, including a solvent tailored
to a new plastics recycling process.
   There are still some kinks to work out with molecular modeling
technology. One complaint is that the programs are time consuming. Another
is that most of today's models work best with small molecules. ``It should
take at least another three years before programs can routinely model
complex polymer processing systems,'' says Chan Chyun Chen, AspenTech's
business manager for polymer process modeling. In process simulation, data
from molecular modeling aren't quite ready for routine use, says Suphat
Watanasiri, product manager for physical properties at Aspen Technology,
Inc. (AspenTech; Cambridge, Mass.).
   But ``the pieces are starting to come together,'' says MKS president Ken
Joback, who designed both Cranium and Synapse packages. Operating companies
have been combining commercial programs with others they've developed
inhouse. DuPont researchers, for example, began their quest for the
ultimate CFC substitute by using, among others, Gaussian's program, which
applies quantum mechanical methods to electronic structure problems. To
design the right molecule, they fed into the computer ideal physical
properties and data on unwanted elements, such as chlorine.
   Once they had a basic molecular geometry, they then calculated the
molecules' vibrational frequencies and, using a Cray supercomputer and the
company's own atmospheric modeling codes, the molecules' potential
contribution to global warming. At this point, data could be fed into a
commercial process simulation program.
   Dow is also mixing and matching its own and vendors' programs, both for
its heat data project, and to build databases of energies for reactive
intermediates. So far, its efforts have achieved results that would be
difficult or impossible to do experimentally, says Nelson Rondan, technical
leader in the company's Computing and Information Technology Lab.

Inhouse and vendor software
First, Dow researchers use Biosym's Insight program to design molecules. 
They then turn to Synthia, a pogram developed inhouse and then licensed to
Biosym, to predict mechanical and other properties, such as solubility and
glass transition temperature, for polymer structures. At that point,
Gaussian's program is used for more- detailed analysis.
   Shell Development Co., meanwhile, is augmenting its use of commercial
modeling software with its own statistical thermodynamic model. Based on
equations of state, the model can calculate phase behavior or solubility.
The company is now looking for a partner to help it develop the program.
   Generally, molecular modeling programs are either derived from
experimental data, or from theoretical principles. Leading in the
development of empirically derived models is the University of Denmark's
Lyngby research group, whose Computer Aided Molecular Design package is
based on the theory of ``group contribution*'' (CE, November 1994, p. 82).
In simple terms, using this theory requires developing a database in which
molecules are divided into groups of related atoms and assigned values,
based on existing data. The data then allow properties to be predicted.
First used to predict activity coefficients, the technique has since been
extended to predict isomeric properties and solubility, and to develop
correlations between predictable properties and toxicity.
   The goal is not to present a single solution but rather to narrow the
search to a number of promising alternatives that can be evaluated further,
says Lyngby group research director, Gani. ``In some cases it's led to
solutions that companies would never have otherwise found.'' Union
Carbide, DuPont, Toyo Engineering, Simulation Sciences and Hyprotech are
among 23 companies now working with the group.
   Now, more programs are combining elements of both empirically and
theoretically derived models. Dow's Synthia, for example, uses empirical
correlation techniques, but bases predictions strictly on local polymer
structure, focusing on polymer chain segments.
   Other examples of programs using both techniques include Biosym's QSPR
(Quantitative Structure Property Relationahip) and MKS's Synapse, both of
which run on Silicon Graphics workstations. With Synapse, users specify
constraints on physical properties such as vapor pressure, flash point or
viscosity. The program then generates the molecular structures of
chemicals that satisfy those constraints. Cranium can then be used to
calculate the physical properties data needed to make a product, such as
activity coefficients, enthalpy of formation, Gibbs energy, density and
thermal conductivity.

Consortia spread the word
To develop the technology in pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical markets,
vendors and developers of modeling software are stepping up their efforts
to reach potential end users. The Lyngby Computer Aided Molecular Design
group offers companies membership in consortia for $7,500/yr.
   Biosym has also formed consortia with industries that have common
problems, a practice that Biosym/MSI is continuing. Participants typically
make a three-year commitment and invest up to $250,000. So far, consortia
are in place to study catalysis and adsorption, as well as polymer
structures, properties and behavior.
   A consortium of private pharmaceutical and chemical companies funded 
development of BatchDesign-Kit by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor George Stephanopoulos. Pollution prevention was a key part of the
program, which is why EPA and the National Science Foundation helped with
funding, while New Jersey Institute of Technology's (NJIT; Newark) Emission
Reduction Research Center provided some technical input.
   Clearly, molecular modeling's marketplace is expanding beyond its
traditional R&D base. Gaussian's program, for example, which costs about
$20,000 per site license, and requires a supercomputer for some
applications, is finding more CPI customers. Proponents are optimistic
about modeling's future in engineering. Says MKS's Joback, ``In less than
ten years, the [software] pieces will be in place to take a new chemical
product all the way from initial concept to a three-dimensional plant
layout.''

COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY WINS CONVERTS

While molecular modeling, or computational chemistry, has assumed a major
role in drug design, traditional laboratory research has been given a boost
by the advent of combinatorial chemistry or synthesis. It allows
researchers to make and test many compounds simultaneously, speeding up the
discovery process. The technology has been under development for about five
years, but only in the last few years have the CPI started to use it.
   Interest is clearly growing. Recently, for example: Parke-Davis
Pharmaceutical Research Div. of Warner-Lambert Co. (Ann Arbor, Mich.) has
spun off its Diversomer organic synthesis technology as a commercial
venture; ArQule Inc. (Medford, Mass.) has set up a joint development
venture for pharmaceuticals with Solvay Duphar B.V. (Brussels, Belgium)
using ArQule's combinatorial chemistry techniques; and a new company has
been formed to commercialize a combinatorial synthesis method for new
materials, developed at Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in California.
   Combinatorial chemistry arose out of the need to speed up the discovery
process, notes Sheila DeWitt, an inventor of the Parke-Davis process and
now vice-president, technical development for the spin-off company,
Diversomer Technologies Inc. Computational chemistry is good for an initial
screening, she says, ``but it didn't live up to the expectation of being
able to use it for to design an active drug directly.You still have to do a
lot of syntheses and tests.''
   At ArQule, up to 4,000 compounds/d can be synthesized by the company's
Automated Molecular Assembly Plant (AMAP; diagram, above), compared with
two or three a week by a researcher using traditional methods. AMAP
consists of tiny, glass-lined reactors, ranging in size from one to 10
milliliters. They are arranged in modules up to about 1 ft2, which can be
heated or cooled as necessary. Compounds are produced from multiple
combinations of reagents by dissolving the reagents in solvents and feeding
different combinations to each minireactor.
   The solvents may be removed by various methods, such as evaporation, or
by binding the reagent on beads, then removing the solvent. ``We need to be
flexible,'' says David Boulton, senior director for automated chemical
synthesis.
   The entire process is computer-controlled, with robotic arms feeding the
reactors and removing samples for analysis. ``We run it like a plant,''
says Boulton. ``Most of the operators are chemical engineers, and we have
process and analytical chemists, mechanical engineers, and systems
engineers to handle the networking.'' He adds that the facility can also be
used for process development.
   ArQule does R&D at the facility in collaboration with partners, such as
the arrangement with Solvay. Although pharmaceuticals are the main area of
interest at present, the technology could be applied to virtually any
chemistry, says Boulton. ArQule also has an agreement with Pharmacia LKB
(Uppsala, Sweden) to develop new affinity ligands for biotechnology
applications in liquid chromatography, and is working on a process for
catalyst development.
   Diversomer Technologies is offering the Parke-Davis system as a product
line. It uses a set of parallel test tubes, filled with sand-like beads
(200-400 mesh). The beads are typically polystyrene, which is stable for
most organic molecules, says DeWitt, and they have functionalized sites to
permit molecule growth. Diversomer has a 40-PIN synthesizer, as it is
called, that can make 40 compounds simultaneously.
   Reagents, dissolved in solvents, are poured into the tubes and react
with the functionalized sites. Different combinations of reagents are fed
to each tube in a preprogrammed, automatically controlled sequence. The
beads are washed between steps and all fluids exit through the porous tube
bottoms. Finally, the products are recovered from the beads by an acid
wash.
   DeWitt points out that the system can also be used for process
development tests on a selected product. In this case, the same product
would be put in all the tubes and different reagents or solvents tested
simultaneously to determine which works best.
   Others use variations of the bead system. Affymax Inc. (Palo Alto,
Calif.), for example, starts with three pots of 10-micrometer-dia
polystyrene beads, which are given identification tags, then mixed
together. They are redivided, randomly, into three lots, each of which is
bathed in a solvent that contains a different chemical building block.
After every step, each lot is split into three more lots, thereby
multiplying the combinations.
   Lawrence Berkeley's process, in contrast with the others, is designed
for making and testing complex metal materials in parallel. Compounds are
created by sputtering individual components, in series, onto specific sites
on a substrate. The laboratory has made superconductors and
magnetoresistive materials, and is now working with phosphors,'' says Peter
Schultz, a professor of chemistry and a principal in Symyx Technologies
(Palo Alto, Calif.), which was set up to commercialize the technology.
Initially, Symyx will develop phosphors for flat panel displays, he says.

A CASE FOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AUDITS

By:
Richard Zanetti, Editor in Chief

Since the mid 1970s, companies in the chemical process industries have been
conducting compliance audits for environmental, health and safety (EH&S)
regulations. Today, a few are going beyond compliance and incorporating
management systems under their auditing umbrellas.
   Management systems audits evaluate processes that achieve management's
EH&S objectives. Rather than measuring the output of a process - usually
defined as a compliance audit - a management systems audit appraises
process strengths and weaknesses.
   Management systems audits aren't new, especially in the European
Community, which has been using British Standard 7750 for about two years
and EMAS, the Eco Audit Management Scheme, since April 1995 (CE, March, p.
49). And next year when ISO 14000 is issued, it will probably include some
criteria for management systems audits, especially on corporate policies
and procedures and senior management commitment.
   Events in Europe have spurred interest among North American CPI firms;
and so have the Canadian and U.S. Responsible Care initiatives - good
examples of management codes and standards that go beyond compliance.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn't address management
systems audits in its Interim Policy Statement on auditing in the April 3,
1995, (Vol. 60, No. 63) Federal Register. But the Agency says it is
considering putting some voluntary criteria into its final policy
document.
   One of the U.S. pioneers, Arco Chemical, initiated its management
systems auditing in early 1991. It formed committees to develop
requirements in such areas as training, operations, maintenance, and EH&S.
   It then measured those management systems' strengths and weaknesses.
``The key was having the people that were going to be evaluated intimately
involved in establishing the requirements,'' says James Garland, director
of manufacturing auditing. ``The audits have contributed to tremendous
improvement throughout the company.''
   But not everyone is sold on management systems audits. One problem is
that they foster resentment among managers, says Ralph Rhodes, director of
health, safety and environmental audits at AlliedSignal. ``Many managers
say, `Tell me what's wrong. I know how to fix it. '''
   Rhodes believes that management systems audits are a ``softer'' kind of
audit than compliance ones. ``You don't have the basic criteria to evaluate
the program as in a compliance audit,'' he says. ``So it's much more
difficult to do, and to convince management of its value.''
   Still, AlliedSignal will be developing a series of management systems
audits next year. The reason: The audits will be useful in finding root
causes of EH&S problems, bring greater attention to management systems'
deficiencies, and communicate across the company's large organizations.
   Management systems audits can build a valuable knowledge base as well.
Because audit teams have done so many audits and visited so many
facilities, they accumulate a wealth of information that can be used to
provide workable solutions to a wide range of company problems.
   Meanwhile, management systems audits are moving beyond traditional EH&S
topics. They are incorporating issues such as product safety, and 
including non-owned facilities.
   We urge all CPI firms to conduct management systems audits. Companies
must have good management systems in place because they set the standards
that drive performance. And good performance always drives compliance.

A NEW METHANOL-TO-OLEFINS ROUTE IS READY FOR COMMERCIAL USE

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Norsk Hydro A.S. (Oslo) and UOP Inc. (Des Plaines, Illinois) are offering
the process for license after completing tests that started last June in a
0.5-m.t./d (methanol feed) demonstration plant at Porsgrunn, Norway. The
methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process was developed as a second step in a
two-step conversion of natural gas to ethylene and propylene and can be
combined with any commercial methanol-production process, according to the
companies. For remote locations, where the cost of liquefied natural gas
ranges from 50 degrees C to $1 per million Btu, the cost of the MTO process
is comparable to that of ethane cracking and can be as low as half the cost
of naphtha cracking, says Henning Reier Nilsen, Hydro's technical director
for base chemicals.
   Methanol is converted in a fluidized-bed reactor at a pressure between 1
and 5 bars and a temperature between 350 and 500 degrees C. The process
converts 80% of the carbon to ethylene and propylene, and can be operated
to yield 50% ethylene and 30% propylene, or a 50:50 mixture. UOP developed
the zeolite-type catalyst of silicon-aluminum-phosphorus oxide.

FIXED-BED CATALYSTS SPEED UP HYDROGENATION

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Degussa AG (Frankfurt) has developed a fixed-bed process that uses new
Raney catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, where suspended
powder-catalysts or nickel-supported catalysts are traditionally used. The
new catalyst types have up to 400% higher activity than the traditional
suspended ones. Also, they can easily be recycled because they contain no
binders or carrier metal, and are significantly harder than conventional
carrier-based catalysts, an indication of longer life, says Roland
Burmeister, development manager. The new nickel-type catalyst, for example,
has a hardness in excess of 300 newtons, compared with less than 50N for
the traditional carrier-based catalyst.
   Nickel, cobalt, copper and iron-type catalysts can be produced by
Degussa in tablet form from the corresponding metal alloy, with pore sizes
up to 0.08 mL/g, which improves catalyst performance, says Burmeister. Like
conventional Raney catalysts, the tablets are then activated in a caustic
solution. In their first commercial applications, the cylinder-shaped
hydrogenation catalysts are already being used in German chemical and sugar
plants, says Burmeister. He adds that the system is economical for plants
running upwards of 10,000 m.t./yr.

REMOVE VOCS WITH A SIMPLER CARBON ADSORPTION SYSTEM . . .

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A single vessel, rather than parallel beds, is used in a new carbon
adsorption system that has been introduced by Vara International (Vero
Beach, Fla.), a division of Calgon Carbon Corp. (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Unlike
the conventional method, in which two or more carbon beds alternately
adsorb and desorb solvents and volatile organics, Vara's Revolver system
has one vessel in which the carbon is divided into four chambers, using
insulated partitions. A cam rotary valve, on a central shaft, continuously
directs the flow of two streams: the solvent-laden inlet air (SLA), which
is introduced by an inlet blower; and regenerant air or steam.
   When a chamber is being regenerated, a pipe that swivels on the shaft
seals off that chamber against SLA, while the valve directs the regenerant
stream to the chamber. Vara says the single-valve assembly, instead of
multiple valves and controls, cuts the installed cost by 50%, compared with
a conventional, dual-fixed-bed system of similar volume.

 . . . OR WITH AN ENERGY-EFFICIENT SORBENT-CATALYST BED

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including chlorinated species, are
adsorbed and destroyed on a single sorbent-catalyst bed that is being
offered for license by the University of Akron (Ohio). Because of the
method's simplicity and energy efficiency, the capital and operating costs
are expected to be only 60% as much as conventional systems that use carbon
adsorption, steam-stripping and thermal destruction, says the inventor,
Howard Greene, a professor of chemical engineering.
   The key element is that the sorbent also serves as a catalyst for
oxidizing the pollutants. The university uses metal-exchanged or
metal-impregnated zeolite pellets, packed in a column. Adsorption is done
at ambient temperature by passing a VOC-laden stream through the bottom of
the column.
   Desorption and catalytic destruction are achieved by electrically
heating the top of the column to the oxidation temperature of 300-400
degrees C, then sequentially heating lower sections. During desorption, the
stream continues to enter the column -- unlike activated carbon systems,
which have parallel beds for adsorption and desorption. In tests, says
Greene, the process has destroyed 99.99% of VOCs.

ENICHEM'S CATALYST BOOSTS CUMENE THROUGHPUT

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A new cumene process, developed by Enichem S.p.A. (Milan), will be
commercialized in March at Enichem's Porto Torres site, where it will
increase the capacity of existing units by 30-40%, to 50,000-60,000
m.t./yr. This will reduce production costs by 20-30%, says Francesco
Pignataro, phenol technology manager. Investment costs for a grassroots
facility are also expected to be lower, he says.
   Cumene, a raw material for making phenol, is produced by reacting
benzene with propylene. Enichem will achieve the increased capacity by
substituting a new beta-zeolite catalyst, which also avoids the toxic waste
generated by the conventional phosphoric acid catalyst. The reaction
conditions, in a fixed-bed adiabatic reactor. are similar to those of the
phosphoric acid route, which operates at 700 kP, except that the
temperature is ``considerably lower'' than the conventional 250 degrees C,
says Pignataro.
    However, the big difference is that the required benzene:propylene
ratio is only 4:1, compared with 7:1-8:1 for the conventional process,
hence the capacity increase (the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1). The total
yield and selectivity are over 99%, says Pignataro.

MICROWAVES CUT FINE CHEMICAL DRYING TIMES BY UP TO 95%

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

By combining a microwave source with a novel Nutsche filter design, the
Belgian company ProCept (Zelzate) claims that it has not only cut the
drying times for pharmaceutical and fine chemical powders by 80-95%, buthas
also eliminated the need for costly supplementary drying with heated
nitrogen. The capital cost is about 40% higher than that of a standard
Nutsche filter with similar peripherals, but this is more than offset by
the advantages, says ProCept.
   Developed as part of the European Union-sponsored Craft program, the
process has been piloted at Solvay's Weesp, Netherlands, plant to dry a 28%
solids slurry of fluvoxamine. It cut the time to achieve a 99.9%-dry powder
from 5 h with a conventional filter dryer, to less than 1 h, says ProCept.
   As with a conventional Nutsche filter, the slurry is charged to the
batch vessel and dewatered to about 20% humidity by the unit's rotating
mixer. A 30- to 200-millibar vacuum is then applied to remove more
moisture. Depending on the need, a single 2.4-GHz microwave source of 6 or
12 kW supplements the vacuum drying. The method is now limited to polar
solvents, but ProCept plans to extend it to non-polar solvents, which do
not absorb microwaves.

A QUICK WAY TO ASSESS HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATION OF SOIL IN THE FIELD . . .

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A field-testing method which measures hydrocarbon contamination in soil in
less than 30 minutes has been developed by Shell Research Ltd.
(Sittingbourne, England). Present practice requires soil samples to be sent
to a laboratory for spectroscopic or chromatographic analysis, which takes
several days and costs 30-50 British Pounds ($47-$78) per sample, notes
development engineer Gordon Lethbridge. The field test requires no
experienced operator and costs 5-10 British Pounds ($8-$16) per sample. It
also reduces the number of samples needed for confirmation.
   Contaminants are extracted from the soil by a proprietary organic
solvent, which also reacts with the aromatic hydrocarbon residues to form a
colored complex. The concentration of the complex is measured by a portable
colorimeter operating at 420 nm. The device has been tested in all types of
soil, including sand, clay and peat, and has a sensitivity of 50 mg/kg of
soil for diesel or gasoline fuel, according to Lethbridge. Shell is
currently negotiating with an undisclosed company to commercialize the
method.

 . . . AND A CHEAP METHOD TO REMOVE THEM

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A mobile processing plant, developed by Umwelttechnologie Terra GmbH
(Treffurt, Germany) is designed to remove hydrocarbons (HCs) and aromatics
from soil or sewage sludge. Compared with incineration processes, which
destroy HCs and fuse and sterilize the soil, the vacuum process operates at
low temperature and recovers the HCs for possible reuse. Treated soil can
be reused for agriculture.
   Contaminated soil is conveyed into an ``okotruck'' (ecotruck).
Hydrocarbons (HCs) are evaporated at 50-60 degrees C under a vacuum of 1-8
millibar, then the HC-laden exhaust is dedusted and condensed at -10 to +5
degrees C. Tests show a reduction of hydrocarbons from 6,300 mg/kg to 14
mg/kg, and BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) from 300 mg/kg to 0.36 mg/kg,
according to Terra. Up to 30 1-m.t./h units will be built within the next
20 months for use on the contaminated sands of Kuwait, as a result of
successful pilot trials with a 1-m.t./h unit. Treatment costs for a
1-m.t./h unit are about DM 35/m.t. ($23), compared with DM 80/m.t. ($54)
for alternative technologies, says Terra. Units up to 17 m.t./h can be
built.

ULTRASONIC `SALAMANDER' DETECTS CRACKS IN PIPELINES

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A battery-operated instrumentation package that checks for cracks as it is
borne along by the fluid inside a pipe, has been developed by Pipetronix
GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), Fraunhofer-Institut fur zerstorunsfreie
Prufverfahren (IzfP; Saarbruchen), and the
Fraunhofer-Technologie-Entwicklungs-Gruppe (Stuttgart). Until now, cracks
could be found only by pressurizing a pipe with water, says IzfP's Gerd
Dobmann, while ultrasonic gages could only measure wall thickness
reductions caused by corrosion.
   The RiBprufmolch (literally, crack-inspecting salamander), uses 896
ultrasonic transducers, which emit ultrasonic waves at a frequency of 2-4
MHz. Echoes from cracks as small as about 0.5 mm are registered and stored
in a computer, says Dobmann. The unit fills most of a pipe's diameter and
has plastic seal rings to maintain its position in the pipe. Up to 100
kilometers can be covered per inspection before the unit's memory becomes
full or the battery needs recharging. For a crude-oil pipeline, a typical
speed is about 1 m/s.

CATALYST GIVES A CALORIE BOOST TO TOWN GAS

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A catalyst developed by NEC Corp. (Tokyo) increases the calorific content
of town gas, derived from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), while
simultaneously removing the entire poisonous carbon monoxide component. In
Japan, LPG is normally converted to a mixture of hydrogen and carbon
dioxide, using an iron-chromium or copper-zinc catalyst. The mixture
contains 2% CO impurity. As the calorific content of this gas is low --
about 2,600 kcal/cubic meters -- butane is added to increase the energy to
5,000 kcal/cubic meters before supplying it to households.
   Instead of adding butane, NEC uses a palladium-rhodium-alumina catalyst
to convert the H subscript 2-CO subscript 2-CO gas mixture to methane and
water at 340 degrees C and 1 atm, at the same time converting all the CO to
methane. The methane yield is 100% and the calorific content of the gas is
10,500 kcal/cubic meters. All the H subscript 2 is converted, but not all
the CO subscript 2, because for every mole of CO subscript 2 there are only
three moles of H subscript 2 (four are needed for complete conversion).
   NEC says the additional cost for supplying gas to 100,000 households
equates to only 93/household per year (U.S.90 cents). NEC plans to
commercialize the process, in conjunction with gas companies, but this is
not expected for at least two to three years.

THIS SORBENT CARES ONLY FOR OXYGEN

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

An adsorbent that reversibly binds twice as much oxygen from air as
materials now used commercially in non-cryogenic air separation, has been
developed by Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (Allentown, Pa.). It also
employs chemical discrimination, adsorbing only O subscript 2, the company
says.
   The new material, a lithium pentacyanocobaltate -- specifically, Li
subscript 3Co(CN) subscript 5.2DMF -- has adsorbed 55 cubic centermeters/g
(2.3 mmol/g) in 10 min under ambient conditions, the highest reported O
subscript 2 capacity for a solid carrier, says Guido Pez, chief scientist
for inorganic and organofluorine chemistry. For comparison, carbon
molecular sieves (CMS) have an equilibrium O2 capacity of about 1 mmol/g
and both CMS and zeolites have an equilibrium nitrogen capacity of about 1
mmol/g. Both are popular for commercial air separation via pressure swing
adsorption (PSA).
   Pentacyanocobaltate salts have long been known for their ability to bind
dioxygen, says Pez, but irreversibly. In Air Products' formulation, the
lithium changes that. The company makes the compound by adding a cobalt
chloride-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution to a lithium cyanide-DMF
solution, causing a reaction that produces single crystals. These are
heated to about 160 degrees C under nitrogen to reach the final product. In
tests, the material has lost 15% of its reactivity over 545 cycles, or
about 17 days. For commercial use it needs to have a half-life of at least
one year, so Air Products is planning further tests.

NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM ACCELERATES HEAT-TRACING DESIGN

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Heat-tracing systems can be designed in a fraction of the time needed for
standard methods through a new software program that has been introduced by
Raychem Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.). The menu-driven program, TraceCalc
Plus, is an improvement over an earlier one marketed by Raychem.
   A key feature is that it provides the capability to design for hazardous
areas, says Chet Sandberg, Raychem's engineering computing manager. It
incorporates the electrical codes of the U.S., Canada, and the European
zone system, and automatically calculates such things as the maximum sheath
temperatures allowable under those codes. It also covers high-temperature,
mineral-insulated cable heaters (as well as self-regulating polymer cable
heaters), and it specifies control and monitoring equipment to meet design
criteria specified by the designer. A single line that includes all these
requirements can be designed in 3 min., compared with 30 min. for the old
program or up to 1 h for manual calculations, says Sandberg.

A HOT BATH CLEANS UP MIXED RADIOACTIVE WASTES

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

The first two commercial-scale plants to use a molten metal bath to treat
mixed radioactive wastes (hazardous wastes contaminated with low-level
radioactive wastes) are now being started up by Molten Metal Technology
Inc. (MMT; Waltham, Mass.). MMT's process, called Quantum-CEP, uses the
catalytic and solvent properties of a molten-iron bath at 3,000F to
dissociate complex wastes to their original elements.
   One plant, operated by MMT for Westinghouse Electric subsidiary
Scientific Ecology Group, Inc. (Oak Ridge, Tenn.), is designed to treat
3,000 tons/yr of ion exchange resins contaminated by low-level radioactive
elements. The other, also at Oak Ridge, will be operated by a limited
partnership between MMT and Lockheed Martin Corp. It will process up to10
million lb/yr of mixed radioactive wastes from government and industry
sources.
   MMT notes that wastes partition into different phases when they 
dissociate, depending on their composition. This allows non-radioactive
materials to be recovered, some as useful products. In the case of
radioactive elements, those that are volatilized and go into the gas phase
may be recovered for disposal. Others, such as uranium, are concentrated
into a stable, glassy material.

PHILLIPS PLANS TO COMMERCIALIZE A NEW 1-HEXENE PROCESS

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

An ethylene-based process for making 1-hexene that produces about 95% of
the desired product, instead of a range of olefins, will be commercialized
by Phillips Petroleum Co. (Bartlesville, Okla.). 1-hexene is a comonomer
used for making high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density
polyethylene (LLDPE). Phillips, the largest single U.S. producer of HDPE,
is piloting the process in a 90-m.t./yr plant and is currently pondering
whether to commercialize it alone or through a joint venture, says Jeffrey
Burkinshaw, director of business planning for Phillips' Chemicals Group.
   The common route to 1-hexene is the oligomerization of ethylene. There
are several variations, using different catalysts, says Burkinshaw, but
they all yield only 10-15% 1-hexene, along with a slate of products ranging
up to C subscript 30 s. Phillips' process uses a much more selective
chrome-based catalyst. The exothermic reaction is done at 80 degrees C and
about 550 psig, using cyclohexane as a diluent.

A `CLEAN' CATALYST FOR ALKYLATION

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A superacid alkylation catalyst that is non-hazardous, in contrast with the
environmentally challenging hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids currently used,
has been developed by Hydrocarbon Technologies Inc. (HTI), a
research-and-development company located in Lawrenceville, N.J. The
catalyst can be retrofitted into existing plants that use HF or H subscript
2SO subscript 4, says Vivek Pradhan, a senior research scientist. He adds
that while the catalyst's expected cost of close to 50c/lb may be slightly
higher than those of current products, the net cost will probably be lower
because it will avoid the problems of storing and handling large volumes of
liquid acids.
   HTI's catalyst is a Bronsted-acid-treated transition metal oxide that is
stable up to 650 degrees C and has shown no noticeable deactivation after
72 h, which is when most catalyst degradation occurs, says Pradhan. In
tests with a laboratory-scale, continuous-flow unit, it has converted more
than 80% of a C subscript 3-C subscript 4 olefin-isobutane feed into C
subscript 5-C subscript 9 multi-branched paraffins, with over 95%
selectivity, he says. The reaction takes place at ambient pressure and less
than 170 degrees C. HTI is seeking partners to build a pilot plant.

A RECYCLING PROCESS FOR SPENT ALUMINUM POTLINER

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Portland Aluminium Co. (Portland, Victoria, Australia), will build a
12,000-m.t./yr plant to recycle spent potliner from its smelter, using a
process developed by Ausmelt Ltd. (Dandenong, Victoria) in cooperation with
Portland. Spent potliner (SPL), from the electrolytic cells or ``pots'' in
which aluminum is produced, is a hazardous material that can no longer be
landfilled. It is mostly carbon, but is contaminated with up to 15% each of
fluorine and sodium and up to 0.5% cyanide. Various methods have been
devised to deal with it (CE, May 1994, pp 44-52).
   In Ausmelt's process, SPL and flux are smelted at 1,100-1,200 dergees C,
while oxygen is blown into the melt through a submerged lance to fuel the
process. O subscript 2 is used, rather than air, to increase the
concentration of hydrogen fluoride in the offgas. This makes it easier to
treat the HF, points out Peter King, executive director of Ausmelt. Some
fluoride combines with the sodium, and sodium fluoride is filtered from the
baghouse and returned to the furnace. Cyanide is destroyed and the carbon
is burned, leaving an inert slag. Everything left can be recycled, says
King. Ausmelt is reviewing options for the slag, including roadfill, and is
developing a process to convert the HF to aluminum fluoride, used as a
smelter additive.

PULSE COMBUSTOR HELPS TO GASIFY BLACK LIQUOR

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A steam-reforming process for gasifying black liquor in pulp and paper
plants and recovering byproducts will be commercialized by ThermoChem Inc.
(Columbia, Md.) and Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. (Boston, Mass.),
following a successful demonstration at the New Bern, N.C., plant of
Weyerhaeuser Co. (Tacoma, Wash.). Currently, black liquor is burned in
chemical-recovery boilers, which capture sodium carbonate and sodium
sulfide for reuse in the mill. However, the boilers' recovery efficiency is
poor and they emit sulfur compounds, says Gary Voelker, ThermoChem's chief
operating officer.
   In ThermoChem's process, black liquor (70 wt.% solids) is steam-reformed
at 1,050-1,150F in a fluidized bed that is indirectly heated by the exhaust
tubes of a pulse combustor. Pulse combustors burn fuel rapidly, producing
pulses that resonate along an exhaust tube. The fluidized bed in the
2.5-ton/h demonstration plant has three combustors, each with 72 tubes that
resonate at 60 Hz. This improves heat transfer into the bed, says Voelker.
   The gasifier produces a 300-400-Btu/scf, hydrogen-rich gas for plant
fuel and for the pulse combustor. Sodium sulfate in the liquor is converted
to hydrogen sulfide and sodium carbonate. A solution of the latter is used
to scrub H subscript 2S from the product gas, regenerating green liquor for
use in the mill.

THE GROWTH RATE IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING GRADUATIONS ACCELERATES

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

On the heels of a 12% increase in the size of the U.S. graduating class in
1994, the 1995 figure was up 16%, to 6,153. The numbers come from an annual
report on degrees awarded, published by the Engineering Workforce
Commission (Washington, D.C.). The increase contrasts starkly with the
total number of all types of engineering graduates, which has remained flat
for the past two years. For 1995, that figure was 64,749, virtually
unchanged from the year before.
   ``These trends are very similar to what was reported last year,'' says
Richard Ellis, research director of EWC's parent, the American Assn. of
Engineering Societies. ``Over the years, chemical engineering has tended to
show a wavelike pattern of peaks and troughs'' in enrollments, and the
numbers reflect an upward swing that began in 1991. He attributes the
popularity to high starting salaries -- just under $40,000, according to
the National Assn. of Colleges and Employers (Bethlehem, Pa.), the highest
of any baccalaureate graduates currently.
   The number of M.S.Ch.E. degrees rose 5.2%, to 1,214. Doctorate Ch.E.
degrees were 636, down 9% from the year before.

CHLORINE RECOVERY PROCESS MAY SAVE WASTE AND MONEY

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Technology to recover chlorine from waste hydrogen chloride that has been
piloted at Carburos Metlicos S.A. (Barcelona, Spain), an affiliate of Air
Products and Chemicals Inc. (Allentown, Pa.), will be further developed by
a consortium of major chemical companies headed by Air Products. It could
save chemical companies millions of dollars, as 25-33% of chlorine
production ends up as waste HCl from chemicals production (CE, June 1992,
p. 21).
   Developed by Ronald Minet, an adjunct professor of chemical engineering
at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), the process reacts
HCl over a copper oxide catalyst at 5-10 psig and about 200 degrees C,
forming copper chloride and water vapor. The CuCl subscript 2 is reacted
with air or oxygen at 5-10 psig and 360 degrees C, releasing the chlorine
and regenerating the catalyst. The consortium plans further testing in
Spain, followed by a technology demonstration if an engineering evaluation
proves favorable.

COAL REPLACES COKE IN IRONMAKING PROJECT

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Full-scale tests of a technology that could reduce significantly the volume
of pollutants produced by the iron and steel industry have begun in
Chesterton, Ind., where Bethlehem Steel Corp. (Bethlehem, Pa.) has
partially substituted coal for coke in two blast furnaces. In ironmaking,
about 1,000 lb of coke is used per ton of metal, but because cokemaking
produces a lot of air pollutants the industry is seeking ways to avoid its
use (CE, Mar. 1995, pp 37-41).
    Coke is used as the reductant because it has more carbon than coal,
but oil or natural gas are injected as fuel. In the tests, coal is
replacing those more-costly fuels, but because it helps with reduction it
also offsets coke use, notes Douglas Jewell, project manager for the U.S.
Dept. of Energy in Morgantown, W.Va., which is supporting the tests. Also,
the coal is being injected in granular form, saving 50% in grinding costs.
The technology for handling granular coal was developed by British Steel
Corp., says Jewell, but so far has been used at less than half the scale of
the Bethlehem tests. Bethlehem is injecting 225 lb of coal per ton of hot
metal in two 7,000-net tons/d blast furnaces, and may increase that to as
much as 400 lb/ton during the 32-month tests.

EPA INCREASES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITTING

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Companies planning to start up hazardous-waste facilities will have to be
more diligent about informing the public in future. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA; Washington, D.C.) has issued a final rule that
requires a prospective operator of such a facility to hold a public hearing
in the community before submitting a permit application under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The meeting must be advertised in
local media and other outlets to assure maximum public participation in the
process.
   The rule, says EPA, will give the permitting agency ``the authority to
require a facility owner or operator to set up an information repository at
any time during the permitting process or the permit life.'' It will also
require the operator of a combustion facility to notify the public prior to
a trial burn.

HUNTSMAN POLYPROPYLENE CORPORATION RECEIVES FACILITY WIDE PERMIT

By:
Peter Silverberg

On December 14, Huntsman Polypropylene Corp.'s 32-year-old facility in
Woodbury, N.J., became the third plant in New Jersey to receive a
``facility wide'' permit from the state's Department of Environmental
Protection (N.J.D.E.P.). The new permit, the first of its kind in the U.S.,
is designed to streamline and make pollution prevention an integral part of
the plant permitting process.
   Now being evaluated by New Jersey, the program focuses on the total
amount of pollutants generated by a facility, using a holistic approach. A
number of environmental agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada are
considering the new permitting approach. ``It is quickly becoming a
national model for regulatory reform,'' says N.J.D.E.P.'s assistant
commissioner, Catherine Cowan.
   A facility wide permit (FWP) is a single permit issued by N.J.D.E.P. to
the owner or operator of a priority* industrial facility, incorporating
permits, certificates, registrations and other approvals. The draft permit
replaces all existing facility permits and can be renewed after five
years.
   Huntsman's FWP covers over 200 individual sources of air emissions,
discharges of storm water through four permitted outfalls, and the storage
and management of hazardous waste in three tanks. For Huntsman, the single
permit will replace 80 different permits for individual process units, and
reduce 10 thick binders' worth of paperwork into a 1.5-in packet.
   More importantly, the process evaluation that Huntsman went through to
apply for the permit has resulted in the elimination of 8.5 million lb of
emissions per year. It will also remove the need for titanium
tetrachloride, isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen chloride, diethyl aluminum
chloride, cyclohexane, triethylamine, and isopentane.
   The critical first step in the permitting process is running a complete
materials account and chemicals inventory. Emissions from every process
line in the plant must be measured, and the results tabulated, either in
pounds per hour, or tons per year.
   Taking one inventory for the entire plant, instead of individual
accounts for separate process units, gets operators in touch with what is
actually going on. ``In many plants, data are old, and no one knows exactly
what is flowing in every pipe,'' explains Jeanne Herb, director of the
N.J.D.E.P.'s Office of Pollution Prevention.
   The next step is to design process modifications, and tabulate the new
emissions levels that will result from those changes. Numbers of prime
interest are pounds of waste before treatment and pounds of waste per pound
of product, says Brian O'Reilly, a chemical engineer with N.J.D.E.P.'s
Office of Pollution Prevention.
   Plant operators can then calculate reduction levels for five years. At
this point, they submit their first application to the N.J.D.E.P. for
review. The Environmental Protection office then makes recommendations,
the plant operators alter their permits, resubmit it, and the process
continues.
   Designed to replace the old adversarial interaction between plant
operators and enforcement officers, the new permit fosters open
communication. It is just this kind of two-way feedback that has made the
program a success so far, says N.J.D.E.P.'s Herb. ``Top down commitment is
required,'' she says, and Huntsman's modernization team leader Frank Gorski
worked closely with N.J.D.E.P.'s O'Reilly to get the process moving.
   The consulting firm, Environmental Resources Management Group (Ewing,
N.J.), also helped, by organizing data from existing environmental permits
into the new format, completing an inventory of air emissions that had
never been inventoried before, evaluating reasonable available control
technology for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the plant's wastewater
treatment unit, and monitoring and reporting on decreasing air emissions at
the unit. For Huntsman, getting final approval took two years. It also
resulted in a plan for significant improvements to the 325-million-lb/yr
facility, for $25 million.
   The biggest change will involve altering the polymerization process by
using a new, high-activity catalyst. According to Huntsman staff engineer
Charles Augustine, the new catalyst harmlessly disperses itself into the
product as it deactivates, so there is no disposal problem. It is also ten
times as active as the old catalyst, which had required a separate disposal
and polymer cleaning unit. In addition, the modernization process
eliminates the need for 107 out of 350 pieces of plant equipment.
   New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman and N.J.D.E.P. Commissioner, Bob
Shinn, who presented the permit to company vice-chairman, John Huntsman
Jr., and president, Ronald Rasband, enthusiastically support the new
permitting approach. ``It will save New Jersey jobs,'' Whitman said.
   So far, Huntsman is the third company in New Jersey to receive this type
of permit. The first was Schering-Plough in Kenilworth, which receive an
FWP in December, 1994. The second, Frigidaire Corp. in Edison, also
received an FWP last month. Next month, Jim Kiel, manager of environmental
affairs for The Geon Co. (Pedricktown), says his company expects to receive
an FWP for an expansion of its polyvinyl chloride resin and compound
plant.
   In March, N.J.D.E.P. will issue a report to the State Legislature
recommending that the program be made permanent. For Huntsman, the permit
helped make the difference between having to shut down the nation's oldest
polypropylene unit, and being able to keep it running efficiently. ``We're
celebrating the lack of bureaucracy in New Jersey,'' said Huntsman
president Rasband.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WRAP UP THE BUSINESS YEAR

The mergers and acquisitions that marked last year continued in December,
which saw the launching of Fluor Daniel/GTI, a merger between Groundwater
Technology (Norwood, Mass.) and the California-based engineering and
construction firm (p. 37). Late last month, the industrial gas producer,
Praxair, Inc. (Danbury, Conn.) extended its tender bid for CBI Industries
until January 16, and raised its offer from $32 to $33/share.
   Last month's mergers and purchases included:
-- Honeywell, Inc.'s (Minneapolis) acquisition of Leeds & Northrup
measurement and control and sensor businesses from General Signal Corp. In
November, the company had acquired Control Systems Consultants, Inc.
(Ashland, Ky.).
-- A.P. Green Industries, Inc.'s acquisition of 51% interest in Lanxide
ThermoComposites, Inc.
-- Rhone-Poulenc's purchase of Dow Chemical Co.'s (Midland, Mich. )

INDIA ATTRACTS THE WORLD'S ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANIES

By:
R. Rajagopal

India is emerging as a major market for environmental technologies, as
more environmental equipment and services companies from the U.S. and
Canada explore new opportunities opened up by ongoing reform and tighter
environmental controls. German companies are also offering technology
packages meeting European Union standards, according to Hartmut Krebs,
deputy minister of North Rhine Westphalia's Ministry of Economics,
Transport and Technology Division.
   According to a recent report by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce (Washington,
D.C.), India is soon to become a major market for U.S.
environmental-service and equipment-manufacturing companies, with annual
demand expected to grow by 25%/yr through the end of the decade.
Technologies tailored to the energy and transportation sectors, solid waste
management and recycling will be India's main areas of interest.
   For U.S. firms, composting, pelletization, waste-to-energy conversion,
and water treatment will all be target areas. As of last month, when U.S.
and Canadian environmental trade delegations visited India, nearly 300 U.S.
companies were seeking joint ventures and collaborations, as well as
licensing agreements, with Indian companies, says one delegation member,
Jay Novak, Commissioner of Minnesota's Dept. of Trade and Economic
Development.
   In addition, roughly 40 Canadian environmental equipment suppliers have
shown interest in collaborating with the Indian companies, according to
international consultant, Richard Denham. Among the most active are
Anderson Operations, Inc. and RV Anderson Associ-ates, Ltd. (Ottawa), and
the Ontario National Trade Corp. Effluent and sewage treatment will be an
area of focus for Ontario International Trade, says the company's assistant
director, Murray Jans. In one project, the Canadian firm will collaborate
with PHE Consultants (Bombay) on a range of water-pollution-control
options.
    Ontario International will also execute a six-year-old, $3-million
contract with the Bombay Municipal Development Corp., funded by the World
Bank. Anderson Operations, Inc. will provide a $500,000 (Canadian) grant
to help fund the project, according to Sanjay Devnani, business development
manager with AOI India, the Canadian Energy Corp.
   Reusing flyash is the focus of other international environmental
projects in India. Working in this area is India Ash Products, Ltd., a
consortium of the U.S. -based ReUse Technologies, a subsidiary of Cogentrix
Energy, and India's India Ash Products LLC and Birla Institute of Technical
Services. India generates 45 million m.t./yr, of which only 2.5% is reused,
according to Birla Institute vice president, D. Chatterjee. The Indian
government has already begun programs designed to replace conventional
industrial boilers with circulating fluidized bed boilers.
   Some Indian-U.S. ventures are already up and running, including the
Bangalore based Kirloskar Ltd., a joint -venture between India's Kirloskar
Group and Snyder General, Inc. of the U.S. The venture has recently signed
a collaborative agreement with Malaysia's Hiong Leong Industrial Group, to
execute turnkey environmental projects in Asean nations and the Far East.

ISO UPDATE, JANUARY 1996

ISO NEWS
Certification: a must for plastics firms? Plastics companies that don't
meet ISO 9000 quality-management standards could be more vulnerable to
product liability suits, according to Sheila Millar, general counsel for
the Plastics Industry Risk Retention Group, an insurer owned by plastics
companies. The standards could affect a company's liability exposure if
those standards become recognized as the generally accepted standard of
care as a matter of law, she says. For more information, or a copy of
Millar's brief, contact Julius Aebly at Risk Retention Management
(800)533-3097, Ext. #113.

Push from Uncle Sam - U.S. government agencies are said to be strongly
urging suppliers to comply with ISO 9000 standards, rather than U.S.
government standards of the past, such as MIL-Q-9858A. In addition, a
consortium of 13 agencies, including the Dept. of Defense, the National
Aeronautics and Space Admin., the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine
Corps, are working on a single quality standard based on ISO 9000

GETTING MORE MILEAGE FROM DISPERSANT
Understanding how solids and liquids interface at the molecular level is
key to boosting efficiency and enhancing multifunctionality

By:
DEBORAH W. HAIRSTON

Whether dispersants are used to suspend pigments in paints and coatings, to
prevent flocculation in pulp slurries, or to improve adhesion of fillers in
polymers, there is no doubt that they work. Exactly how dispersants work
and what else they can be made to do are questions that suppliers are
scrambling to answer.
   For companies that make and market dispersants, such information is
vital to the development of surfactant and polymeric dispersing agents that
are environmentally friendly, cost effective and multifunctional. The
search for clues has them investigating the molecular behavior of solids in
liquids, trying to unravel the secrets of their surface interactions.
   Several factors are driving suppliers to extract more mileage from their
products. Traditionally, formulators have relied upon their technical
know-how to make dispersants. But there is an element of art in what they
do, too. While chemists dabble with different compounds to achieve desired
results, the trial-and-error method is an imperfect one that may have
unforeseen consequences for the process, the product, or the environment.
   To optimize production and reduce contaminants, such risks have to be
minimized. Furthermore, a more thorough knowledge of dispersants would
allow formulators to eliminate the bad actors, upping purity and
performance.
   ``Previously we sold products in unit operations, but now we have to
look at the impact on the total operation,'' says Terry Say, director of
technology for paper and textile chemicals at Rhone-Poulenc Inc. (Cranbury,
N.J). ``At the very least, we want to be sure that the solution doesn't
have a detrimental effect downstream. Preferably, we would like the
dispersant to have some beneficial effect.''
   The challenge of finding those solutions is only intensified by
environmental regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certain
chemicals in dispersants and dispersions. For example, many solvent-based
dispersions are being replaced with aqueous ones.
   This changeover is increasing demand for dispersants that can perform in
water. And existing chemicals are expected to be the primary source of any
new dispersants. ``There is a lot of synergy that we don't exploit,'' says
Say. ``We can use that information to solve customers' problems.''
   Typical of the research underway is that being done at the Polymer
Interfaces Center at Lehigh University (Bethlehem, Pa.), which is
supported by ten industrial companies. Work there is focused on three areas
-- adsorption, wetting and adhesion, and mechanical behavior.
   Currently, the center is studying pigment dispersants and thickeners to
learn exactly what the molecules are doing and how to stabilize them in a
medium, usually water, against settling and flocculation, and maintain this
stability in the dry state. ``The world has known for a long time how to do
this with solvents, but water-based materials offer new and more demanding
challenges to develop good adhesion, especially under wet conditions,''
says Andrew Mercurio, the center's associate director for knowledge
transfer.
   Novel formulations of organometallic coupling agents based on titanates
have been shown to act as dispersants and as catalysts in unfilled and
filled polymers, says Salvatore Monte, president of Kenrich Petrochemicals,
Inc. (Bayonne, N.J.). Monte cites an IBM patent for magnetic recording
disks containing an iron oxide-filled resin treated with the firm's KR 38S
pyrophosphate titanate. The coupling agent disperses and chemically bonds
the iron particles to the resin. And the agent ``catalyzes the resin to
provide strength and durability without alumina particulate
reinforcements.''
   In another case, Asahi Chemical Industry has used Kenrich products to
improve the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene. This and other
research has led Monte to speculate that titanate coupling agents can be
used in situ like metallocene catalysts.
   Industry observers are skeptical. ``Organometallics have some dual
functionality, but their application as metallocene catalysts may be
stretching it a bit far,'' says Say.

Environmentally friendly
The range of applications for dispersants is as varied as the industries in
which they are used. But across-the-board, they are being formulated to be
compatible with environmentally friendly processes.
   For example, demand for copolymer dispersants for water treatment is
growing at about 5%/yr, diminishing the popularity of homopolymers, for
which demand is now virtually flat. The trend reflects the move away from
heavy-metal corrosion inhibitors and the growing use of alternatives, such
as phosphates. ``The chemistry that worked with old programs doesn't work
now,'' says Bob Zuhl, business manager for water-treatment chemicals at BF
Goodrich Co. (Akron, Ohio).
   Last fall, BF Goodrich introduced two general-purpose dispersants for
boiler-water treatment. Good-Rite K-765 and 766 fill a gap in the company's
product line for dispersants based on sodium polymethacrylates. Free of
formaldehyde and ammonia, the products are ``greener and safer than some
comparable products,'' says Zuhl. The dispersants meet U.S. guidelines for
boiler-water additives, and are chemically acceptable as boiler-water
treatment compounds proposed for use in meat and poultry plants.
   Under pressure to recover and reuse water, chemical processors are
looking for high-performance dispersants that can work at higher cycles of
concentration, says Zuhl. The type of dispersant required for a cooling
tower will vary, depending on the source of the makeup water. The use of
recycled municipal wastewater, for example, may require a treatment
program, including dispersant, that is tailored for organic, nutrient-rich
water.
   To help pulp mills ease the bottlenecks encountered as they attempt to
close up their water systems, BetzPaper Chem Inc. (Jacksonville, Fla.)
custom-blended surfactants and dispersants. The formulation, CustomSperse
improves pulp mill washing by more than 50%, says Darin Pekarek, a product
specialist for the company. The wash aid lowers the carryover of organics,
saltcake, total dissolved solids as well as pitch.
   Efforts of paint formulators to eliminate solvents from their systems
prompted Air Products and Chemicals (Allentown, Pa.) to include
solvent-free dispersants and grind aids in its line of of Surfynol
surfactants. For example, CT-131 is a grind aid for aqueous pigment wetting
and dispersion.
   Also in the Air Products surfactant line are other dispersants that
provide multiple benefits. For example, CT-136 is recommended for grinding
and dispersion of pigments in aqueous media. But the product is also
suitable for universal-type dispersions, including glycol solvent-tint
bases for water-based or solvent-based inks and coatings. In addition, the
company makes CT-141, a low-molecular-weight dispersant for aqueous pigment
dispersions.

Multiple benefits
Similarly, Rhone-Poulenc sells a full line of dispersions, including
polymeric formulations for aqueous systems. Based on carboxyl functional
polymers in a range of molecular weights, these products are particularly
promising, says Rhone-Poulenc's Say. The company is currently looking at
different types of monomers that can be incorporated into the
low-molecular-weight polymers.
   As a major producer of paints and coatings, PPG Industries (Pittsburgh,
Pa.) can draw on its considerable inhouse resources. The firm's Mazsperse
agents are available for organic and inorganic pigments, as well as solvent
and water-based coatings. Mazsperse 85B, which is good for dispersing
carbon black, is formulated for applications where low foam is required.
   Three fluorochemical surfactants developed by the Specialty Chemicals
Div. of 3M (St. Paul, Minn.) are useful as dispersants. However, Fluorad
FC-129, 143 and 118 are applicable only for the manufacture of
fluorochemical-based polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), says
Leo Gehlhoff, a technical service specialist for the company. The advantage
of FC-118, a 20% active, anionic solution of ammonium perfluorooctanoate in
water, is that it can be reclaimed and recycled from the fluoropolymer
manufacturing process.
   Meanwhile, much of the new research will determine how a dispersant sits
on the surface of a polymer. Knowing this will allow producers to design
greater functionality per molecule. Says Lehigh's Mercurio: ``That will go
a long way towards improving a dispersant's efficiency and cost
structure.''

A MICROWAVE DEVICE MEASURES HIGH-PURITY AND AGGRESSIVE LIQUIDS

This noncontact instrument measures liquids, pastes, oils and slurries.
Accuracy is + or - 1 cm over a distance of 0-30 m. The Nautic-Level-Radar
device is based on the frequency-modulated continuous wave radiated from an
antenna within the tank and reflected from the product. The reflected
signal is received and mixed with part of the transmission signal,
resulting in a frequency that is an exact indication of the distance from
the surface of the product liquid level. The device, which operates over a
temperature range of -20 degrees C to 150 degrees C, uses
corrosion-resistant gaskets made of DuPont's Kalrez or Viton
fluoroelastomer. -- Krohne Messtechnik GmbH & Co., Duisberg, Germany

THE SECRET'S OUT: CLEAN IN PLACE THE
Well known in pharmaceutical and food plants,CIP is further taking root in
the CPI

By:
Jesse C. Stewart and Dale A. Seiberling, Seiberling Associates, Inc.
Edited by Jayadev Chowdhury

  CIP for the CPI
The CIP design techniques discussed here have been recently applied to an
industrial chemical process, and its success establishes CIP's potential
for cleaning a wide variety of equipment. The success is due to the client
taking a prudent risk to apply a technology that's new, and by integrating
CIP and process design efforts up front.
   The client wanted an integrated process and CIP system capable of
sequentially producing seven highly potent compounds with very-low
cross-contamination limits. The original cleaning objectives were:
  Control cross-contamination between products to less than 10 ppm.
Existing systems could achieve no lower than 200 ppm cross-contamination
through flushing, boil-up, water-blasting and hand-cleaning
  Achieve a changeover from one product to another in less than three
days.
  The existing plant required 14 days
  Improve safety by eliminating water blasting, vessel entry, and extensive
dismantling of equipment
  Reduce aqueous and organic waste by 80%
  Reduce labor required for changeovers

   The CIP system and overall process were designed and integrated right
from the beginning. The result is a CIP-able plant that includes the
required vent lines to an incinerator and an accompanying dry-vacuum system
for handling spills. To date, there have been 12 product turnarounds in the
plant, and the CIP results have exceeded objectives.
   Figure A shows this multi-product plant with bulk-powder handling,
reactions in glass-lined vessels, centrifuging, drying, and dust
collection. The final products are very potent (active in small
concentrations), and so the equipment is vented through primary, secondary
and final HEPA filters.
   All the piping and equipment (including three dust-collection systems)
are cleaned by a single skid-mounted CIP unit (Figure B), with line
circuits and fixed sprays for vessels, heat exchangers, screws, bins, dust
collectors, centrifuges and ducts. During cleaning, the CIP solution is
recirculated at around 300 gal/min, and sequenced through the plant via
supply and return valves controlled by a distributed process-control
system.
   The process fluid is corrosive, so most of the equipment is constructed
of Hastelloy, or glass- or polytetrafluoroethylene-lined steel. Figure C
shows how Hastelloy spray balls and supply tubes are installed in vessels,
and interfaced via a flanged joint to less-expensive PTFE-lined pipe.
   The first drum of the new material exiting the dryer is analyzed for
cross-contamination of the previous product. In the majority of cases,
there has been no detectable cross-contamination. The maximum contamination
that has been detected is 1.5 ppm.
   The CIP system's high performance is causing the company to consider
extending CIP techniques to two new products. These products are highly
sensitive to cross-contamination, but now can now be produced in the same
multi-product facility, cancelling millions of dollars in investment that
was previously planned for a new plant.


Clean In Place (CIP) is an essential production tool that's saving
companies in many chemical process industries (CPI) millions of dollars in
operating costs and investment. CIP is an automated method of cleaning
process plants, involving little or no dismantling of piping or equipment.
   In the cleaning cycle, CIP brings flushing, washing, rinsing and (often)
sanitizing solutions into continuous and close contact with all wetted
equipment surfaces to remove product ``soil.'' The cleaning process
involves both chemical and physical aspects, and generally requires
recirculation to minimize water, chemical and waste-treatment costs.
   CIP has been widely applied in dairy, brewing, food and wine processing
for more than 35 years; more recently, CIP has found acceptance in
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other batch-processing operations.
However, other CPI sectors, including industrial chemicals, agricultural
products, petrochemicals and petroleum refining, have paid little attention
to this highly effective cleaning technique.
   The primary reasons include a lack of knowledge and understanding of
CIP-based cleaning technologies, and a reluctance to change. As a result,
these industries continue to carry out their cleaning chores using
``boilups,'' flushing, high-pressure water blasting, and manual scraping
and vacuuming.

Why CIP?
There are three primary reasons for using CIP. The first - and most
important - is that CIP is far superior to any other cleaning method. With
CIP, each cleaning program is the same as the previous one; this
repeatability, in turn, translates to reliability.
   Offspec or contaminated products, which result in lost production or
costly rework, can be eliminated using CIP. The steps or sequencing in CIP
cleaning are fully automated through programmable logic controllers (PLC),
distributed control systems (DCS), or other automated controllers. Thus,
human errors associated with manual cleaning are eliminated.
   The driving force for CIP's rapid adoption in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries lies in the more-stringent validation requirements
of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. CIP makes FDA validation and ISO
9000 accreditation easier to accomplish than is possible with other
cleaning methods, which exhibit a greater degree of variability.
   The second reason for using CIP is lower operating costs. With CIP,
labor costs are reduced because cleaning is fully automated and there is
minimal or no dismantling of equipment. The turnaround time required for
cleaning is reduced, increasing plant capacity.
   Also, water and solvents for cleaning are significantly reduced. This is
particularly important if pure (and costly) water is used for cleaning, or
if the solvent wastes have to be incinerated.
   The third reason for using CIP is safety improvement. Plant personnel no
longer have to dismantle equipment, using ladders or temporary supports.
Time-consuming and dangerous vessel entry is not required, nor are such
inherently hazardous activities as manual scraping, vacuuming and
high-pressure water blasting.
   Safety is also improved when cytotoxic products are cleaned from
facilities. CIP greatly reduces any possible exposure of personnel to such
products, compared with disassembly and manual cleaning of equipment.

CIP's basic concepts
An integral part of the earliest ``automated'' CIP installations is
permanently installed supply-and-return piping that is separate from the
facilities' process piping. For example, in dairy processes (Figure 1),
some food plants, and in portions of some pharmaceutical facilities, it is
necessary to be able to clean process and storage vessels during the
production run. A number of the vessels may contain product when the
process piping is subsequently cleaned in place.
   The 3-A Accepted Practices for Permanently Installed Sanitary Pipelines
and Cleaning Systems require that ``All connections between the solutions
circuit(s) and the product circuit(s) shall be constructed as to positively
prevent the co-mingling of product and solution during processing.'' This
regulatory requirement is generally complied with by installing dedicated
piping to convey flush, wash and rinse solutions from a central CIP
recirculation unit to all of the plant's tanks, transport tankers, and
product-piping circuits.
   Dedicated CIP supply and return piping. The supply of cleaning solutions
to the storage-tank sprays is controlled with air-operated valves and
U-bend cleaning hookup stations (floverters), thus ensuring that only one
tank is connected at a time to the cleaning system. The flow of
post-cleaning solutions from the storage tanks is generally carried out by
positioning a movable elbow between the tank's outlet valve and a permanent
CIP return header connected to a return pump.
   Tankers are cleaned with drop-in spray devices or permanently installed
sprays, supplied with a hose; tanker return flow is carried out via a hose
to a return pump. Check valves in the return system ensure the continuous
movement of flush, wash and rinse solutions from the return pumps to the
recirculating unit.
   Integrated process and CIP piping. The evolution of the above concept to
a modern, high-capacity dairy process is illustrated in Figure 2, which
includes a high-capacity high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization
system with a plate heat exchanger (pasteurizer), homogenizer and
self-cleaning centrifuge (the latter is in the background and not visible
in the photo). The ``all welded'' piping to and from the remainder of the
process is cleaned from a central, automatic CIP system.
   The HTST process is cleaned with the available process pumps, valves,
controls and heat-exchange equipment that are configured and controlled to
clean at the end of the production run. The required manual connections are
facilitated by two U-bend transfer panels (center left, Figure 2). In many
``extended shelf-life'' milk plants in the U.S. and Canada, all piping,
flow-control valves, pasteurized surge tanks and fillers downstream of the
HTST process in Figure 2 are cleaned in a single high-volume circuit after
each days' processing and packaging.
   Since integrated process-and-CIP piping systems use product piping to
convey flush, wash and rinse solutions to the tanks and packaging machines,
capital and operating costs, water and chemical usage, and labor are
greatly reduced. At the same time, quality is substantially improved by
eliminating the recontamination that accompanies manual connections.
   The CIP equipment in modern dairies is installed in centrally located
CIP equipment rooms (Figure 3). The equipment for supplying the alkaline
and acid chemicals, water conditioners and sanitizing solutions are
generally located adjacent to the CIP recirculating units.
   Varied applications. Whereas CIP cleaning was initially used only for
liquid food processes, the labor savings and the high reliability and
performance of the CIP systems eventually led to the redesign of several
dry, granular processes. A generic food process for dry granular process,
shown in Figure 4, is a small-scale representation of some very successful
applications.
   Here, the entire process is designed to be CIP-able, by allowing
materials to drain to one or more collection points. Each spray shown in
Figure 4 represents a multiplicity of sprays, supplied by a common valve
from the primary CIP supply line. Flush, wash and rinse solutions are moved
progressively through the process, from top to bottom, under automatic
control.
   For instance, a major food plant was designed to permit simultaneous
internal CIP (food-product contact surfaces) and external CIP (non-food
contact surfaces, support structures, service lines, and so on), using
separate CIP recirculation units. Further, a sanitary floor was employed to
collect the CIP solutions for the external systems.
   CIP has also been applied to large and complex process systems, such as
milk and whey evaporators, and dryers. These concepts, found suitable for
the food spray dryers, were later proven equally applicable to typical meat
smokehouses (Figure 5).
   In pharmaceutical and biotechnology plants, well-engineered CIP systems
can help achieve controlled cleaning, freedom from recontamination,
improved product containment, and higher operator safety. CIP systems can
also contribute to the required degree of automation of both batch
processes and the accompanying tank-to-tank transfers. The generic process
shown in Figure 6 represents one of a multiplicity of similar tanks of
varying sizes, and shows how automatic valves can be combined with U-bend
transfer panels to satisfy the process automation, flexibility and
isolation requirements of such plants.
   These techniques are transferrable to most CPI plants, as has been
demonstrated in many liquid, slurry and solids processes in the last few
years. However, to ensure proper results, it is critical that the plant's
equipment must be designed for CIP.
   To date, most types of equipment have been cleaned successfully by CIP,
including:
-- Vessels with agitators, baffles and auxiliary equipment
-- Pumps, valves and piping, centrifuges and filters, dryers, evaporators
and heat exchangers
-- Dump stations, dust collectors and bins
-- Rotary valves and slide valves
-- Sifters, mills and blenders
-- Screw and belt conveyors
-- Distillation columns
-- Packaging machines

Design criteria
CIP is most effective when the process and CIP systems are designed and
integrated early in a project's development. Equal consideration should be
given to CIP and process design. Process equipment and piping designed to
be CIP-cleanable should meet the following minimum criteria:
All the equipment that comes into contact with cleaning solutions should be
made of corrosion-resistant and cleanable materials, such as stainless
steel, or lined with glass or polytetrafluoroethylene. Less-exotic
materials will be corroded by cleaning solutions, which normally contain
such chemicals as caustic, acid and sodium hypochlorite.
   The equipment must be designed to confine the cleaning solutions.
Typical dust-handling equipment may not be water-tight, which would allow
CIP cleaning solutions to spill onto the floor and on the outside of
equipment.
   The equipment, must be drainable with no pockets or ledges. The bottoms
of flat vessels should pitch not less than 1/4 in. per ft, from rear to
front outlet, and 1/2 in. per ft from side to center, to provide reasonable
flow across the surfaces for moving suspended solids.
   All corners - whether horizontal or vertical - should be rounded, with a
minimum radius of 1 in.
   Gaskets and seals should be crevice-free, non-absorbent, non-reactive,
non-porous, and positioned to eliminate non-cleanable crevices. Gaskets and
seals used in the dairy, food and pharmaceutical industries must be made of
FDA-approved elastomers.
   Flanges and interconnecting fittings in piping should be minimized
   Piping dead ends and branches should be employed sparingly
   All valves should be cleanable. Generally, only two types of valves are
considered CIP cleanable: air-operated, sanitary compression valves (Figure
7), and air-operated diaphragm valves.
   Depending on the cleanliness required, other types of valves, such as
butterfly, rotary, check, slide and ball valves have also been cleaned
successfully with CIP. Special CIP solution-injection ports must be
provided to clean the seal areas of several of these valves
   Mass, vortex and magnetic flowmeters are considered CIP cleanable
   Use of hoses should be minimized, and the best location for gages are in
vertical pipe runs
   All piping and ducts should be pitched 1/16 to 1/8 in. per ft to drain
ports
   A detailed list of CIP design criteria is available in References 3, 4
and 6.

Controllable factors
The most important factors influencing the effectiveness of CIP cleaning
are cleaning time; cleaning agent temperature, concentration and chemistry;
degree of turbulence of the cleaning solution (physical action); and the
characteristics (cleanability) of the surface being cleaned. These factors
have a synergistic effect on cleaning performance. The right chemistry
combined with the right concentration, temperature and time will yield a
cleaning regimen that best fits a system's needs. The variables are best
evaluated in a laboratory setting before commercial facilities are
designed.
   Selection of cleaners. CIP is greatly dependent on chemical action. As a
general rule of thumb, most residues are easily removed with a dilute (1%
or less), formulated alkaline cleaner. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are the
building blocks for most of the chemicals produced today, and these bonds
are easily broken apart in hot alkaline conditions.
   The most common and aggressive alkaline cleaner is sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and is typically used in 0.15-0.5% concentrations for
non-heat-transfer surfaces, and at 1-5% for plate-type and tubular heat
exchangers, and other heavily soiled surfaces.
   Depending on the water quality and soil, several types of additives are
often integrated into the cleaning solution. Chelating agents are used in
systems where hard water is a problem. Sodium hypochlorite is added to
alkaline solutions at levels of 30-100 ppm, to enhance the removal of both
fat and protein soiling.
   A lightly acidified final rinse aids in removing all traces of alkaline
product from equipment surfaces, enhancing draining and drying, and
providing bacteriostatic conditions that delay the growth of organisms
found in most sources of water supply. Strong, hot acid solutions may be
applied in sequence before or after alkaline solutions to clean
heat-exchange equipment.

A typical CIP cleaning cycle
Cleaning cycles and the choice of cleaning chemicals depends on the type of
soil. While many variations exist, the following is a typical cleaning
cycle:
  1. Pre-rinse with the lowest grade of water available or with recovered
solution. The purpose of this step is to remove as much ``loose'' soil as
possible prior to the formulated alkaline wash. Pre-rinsing of most organic
fat, carbohydrate or proteinaceous soil is generally accomplished with
ambient temperature water or warm recovered solution
  2. Alkaline wash with recirculated, formulated solutions. This sequence
brings hot (typically 55-80C), chemical-laden solution into intimate
contact with all soiled surfaces. Since relatively long contact times are
required for this primary cleaning step, recirculation of the cleaning
solution is essential for economical operation
  3. Post-rinse with water, normally at ambient temperature. This step is
to rinse away most of the residual alkaline cleaner. This solution is
sometimes recovered for the pre-rinse in the next CIP cleaning program.
  4. Acid rinse, normally at ambient temperature with recirculated acid
solutions. The purpose of this step is two-fold:
   The acid rinse will neutralize and remove residual alkaline cleaner.
Alkaline cleaners form ``films'' on equipment that are not readily removed
by a simple post-rinse with water
   The acid rinse will also remove mineral deposits, left by the water used
in the chemical solution and rinses, from the cleaned surfaces
  5. Post-rinse with water or recirculated sanitizing rinse, used to apply
a bactericidal agent to all cleaned surfaces. The post-rinse is often
heated to permit fast drying of equipment. Some plants follow the
post-rinse with heated air, blown through the CIP sprays or separate supply
ports, to aid in equipment drying

The CIP circuits
In some applications, an entire process, or an easily isolated portion of a
large process, is shut down and cleaned in its entirety. Other processes
may require a vessel or transfer line to be cleaned while the remaining
process equipment is used to manufacture product. In this situation, U-bend
transfer panels (Figure 8) with interlocked proximity switches are used to
separate the cleaning solution from the product.
   Swing elbows, leak-protection valves and double block-and-bleed
(mix-proof) systems are other methods of isolating the cleaning solution
from the product or from the equipment that must be kept dry. With proper
product isolation, CIP solutions can be circulated in various types of
cleaning circuits even while product processing continues. Cleaning
circuits typically have the following characteristics:
   CIP solutions are normally pumped through process piping that is 4 in.
in diameter, or less. This is because cleaning effectiveness is enhanced by
physical action due to turbulent flow.
   Piping systems can be effectively cleaned by recirculating CIP solutions
at velocities of 5 ft/s or more in the largest-diameter piping in the CIP
circuit. The 5 ft/s is a general standard for CIP systems, but lower
velocities may be effective with increased circulating times, temperatures
or chemical concentrations.
   Line circuits may include equipment such as pumps, colloid mills, heat
exchangers, centrifuges, homogenizers and filters that are CIP-cleanable,
and so able to withstand the required flows and pressures. A typical
circuit for cleaning transfer piping connected via U-bend transfer panels
is shown in Figure 6 (bottom center)
   Vessels and other large process equipment, such as basket centrifuges,
dryers, conveyors, evaporators, pipes or ducts, and shell-and-tube heat
exchangers are generally sprayed rather than flooded, to reduce pumping
requirements. Figure 6 shows a typical circuit for a biotech process vessel
(lower right)
   The CIP solution-return system is designed to maintain a very small
puddle of product in the bottom of a vessel, to reduce the amount of
cleaning solution required, and to prevent the ``bath tub'' deposit of soil
at the liquid-air interface. Vessels can be effectively cleaned by
distributing CIP solution on the upper surfaces at flowrates of 2.0-2.5
gal/min per foot of circumference for vertical domed vessels, or at 0.2-0.3
gal/min per square foot of internal surface for horizontal and rectangular
tanks, mixers, bins, dryers, cyclones and ductwork
   In many applications, the vessel may be cleaned as part of a combination
circuit where process piping and pumps are engineered to serve the CIP
solution supply or return function, or both (the integrated process and CIP
design)

The CIP recirculating systems
The components of a CIP recirculating unit are typically skid-mounted on a
frame, to simplify the installation of the electrical wiring, and utility
and drain connections. The units typically consist of:
   A recirculation tank with supply pump, to recirculate solution to the
process piping and equipment
   A heat exchanger to heat the cleaning solution
   A programmable logic controller (PLC), instrumentation and valves, to
control sequencing, solution flowrate and temperature, and monitor
conductivity or resistivity, or both (these indicate cleaning solution
strength and rinse water purity)
   Additional auxiliary equipment, such as an eductor, automatic strainer
or water tanks. A strainer can be used to automatically discharge suspended
oversized solids to the drain. The strainer will discharge when the
pressure drop across the strainer exceeds a pre-determined value
   A chemical-feed system. Most often, chemicals are metered volumetrically
from drums to the cleaning system by diaphragm pumps mounted in a separate
cabinet. Cleaning chemicals can also be fed from bulk-storage tanks through
meters

Selecting CIP equipment
A single-use eductor-assisted (SUEA) recirculator is shown in Figure 9.
This unit has a motive pump and eductor mounted on the skid. The eductor is
capable of producing about 15 in. of vacuum, to pull returned solution back
to the recirculation tank. The eductor may act alone to return the
solution, or can operate in series with a CIP return pump near the process
vessel or other equipment being cleaned.
   The required pumping rate for supplying solutions is determined by the
size of the transfer lines and vessels to be cleaned. Again, the optimum
velocity in lines being cleaned needs to be 5 ft/s. If a single CIP
recirculation unit is applied to clean lines and tanks, the CIP
requirements for the largest tanks will generally establish the maximum
delivery rate.
   Vessels less than 5 ft in diameter require a supply of 40 gal/min; tanks
of 8 to 12 ft in diameter will require 80-90 gal/min. It is desirable to
clean as much of the equipment and piping as possible with a relatively
small variation of flow. A turndown from high to low flow of more than 50%
causes difficulty in properly sizing flow-control valves, heat exchangers
and chemical pumps.
   The CIP pump's discharge head must exceed the head loss through the
longest piping circuit, and it must supply the sprays in the largest and
most-distant tank at the required operating pressure. Since most commonly
applied sprays operate at 25-30 psig, and the approximate head loss through
sanitary tubing is in the magnitude of 5 ft per 100 ft of length, pump
discharge pressures are normally in the range of 50 to 80 psig, well within
the capability of sanitary centrifugal pumps. If the CIP delivery rate is
to be controlled by a flow valve, then the pump discharge head should be
about 1.2-1.3 times the maximum circuit loss (including spray supply
pressure for tank CIP circuits), for effective rate control with sanitary
flow-control valves.
   The recirculation tank is often as small as 60 gal. If the plant water
supply is substantially lower than the CIP pump's delivery rate, then the
CIP unit must contain one or more water tanks to supply the required water
flow. A physical break or ``double block and bleed'' valve is often used
between the water supply and the water tanks to ensure no contamination of
the water source. If the available water supplies permit the use of a
single recirculation tank and no water tanks, the water should be delivered
to the recirculation tank through a spray designed to rinse all the tank's
upper surfaces and sidewall areas.
   A shell-and-tube heat exchanger is normally part of the CIP unit. The
pre-rinse to remove most fat, carbohydrate or proteinaceous soil is carried
out with water at ambient temperature, or below 45C, to avoid ``cooking''
or setting the soil on the equipment surface.
   The cleaning solution is recirculated and heated with a shell-and-tube
heat exchanger, to temperatures between 55 and 80C. Hot-water sanitizing
may require delivery of water at 90C. Steam should be available in
sufficient capacity to heat the recirculated solution and the equipment
being cleaned to the desired temperature in 5-10 min, to keep cleaning
times reasonably low.
   Shell-and-tube heat exchangers must be insulated for safety reasons.
But, for sanitary reasons, it is desirable to avoid insulating CIP tanks,
solution lines, pumps and valves. Safety is also improved by limiting the
access of non-essential or untrained personnel to the facilities during CIP
operation.
   CIP solutions can be returned by several methods:
   A CIP solution return pump can be installed near the vessel being
cleaned. Low-speed (1,750 rpm), return pumps will provide effective return
flow to the CIP recirculation unit's tank, if the return line pitches
continuously from the tank being cleaned to the pump inlet, and if a static
head of 18-24 in. of water is available.
   The pitch permits air to escape the pump and return to the tank being
cleaned. On long return lines, or on CIP return headers, an air-relief
valve located at the pump inlet will provide improved performance. ``Self
priming,'' sanitary return pumps will more easily handle entrained air than
conventional pumps, but they are also more expensive. High-speed (3,450
rpm), return pumps have a greater tendency to become ``air bound'' than
low-speed pumps
   Gravity flow by itself will remove rinse and wash solutions from the
vessel being cleaned if the tank outlet, valve and return piping is
sufficiently large and the static head is adequate. This method generally
requires the CIP recirculation unit to be 12-16 ft below the outlet of the
vessel being cleaned. Return piping should be pitched continuously from the
vessel being cleaned to the recirculating unit
   An eductor will handle both air and water, and can be used alone or with
a return pump. If used alone, the head loss in the system must be limited
to the vacuum produced by the eductor, generally being in the magnitude of
14-15 ft of water pressure drop.
   Eductor performance may be affected by solution flashing if the
temperature is too high. Those systems that combine eductors and return
pumps (eductor-assisted CIP systems) can effectively use high-speed (3,450
rpm) high-head pumps. The eductor continuously primes the high-head pump.
The high-speed pump is usually less expensive than an equivalent low-speed
pump, and the higher discharge head permits the use of smaller diameter
return-side piping, of lesser volume
   Top pressure may be used in place of gravity or a return pump to induce
flow from a pressure-rated vessel through the return piping to the
recirculating unit. A hold-back valve may be required in the return line to
control the weight of the cleaning solution puddle being maintained in the
vessel being cleaned, and to prevent loss of top pressure by blowing the
puddle out of the vessel, except at the desired times at the end of each
major program step

Selecting spray devices
There are two basic types of sprays used for CIP: static and dynamic-head
sprays. Figure 10 illustrates three variations of the static spray
including a pumpkin-shaped ball; a tube spray with many directionally
drilled ``bubble'' spray heads; and a ``bubble'' spray. All the sprays are
removable via tri-clamp connections or slip joints for inspection and
cleaning.
   The balls are used in such equipment as vessels; the ``bubble'' sprays
are used in ductwork and equipment where the spray device must be recessed
to prevent contact with product and other special applications. The tube
sprays are used in a variety of applications, such as difficult-to-reach
areas or where the number of nozzles for mounting multiple balls is
limited.
   These sprays have found wide acceptance for permanent installations in
pharmaceutical, dairy and other industries. The static sprays have been
found to be effective and reliable cleaning devices when used in
combination with properly controlled chemical cleaning programs. The sprays
are sanitary, there are no moving parts, and spray performance is not
affected greatly by minor variations in supply pressure.
   Dynamic head sprays produce a rotating pattern and are driven either
electrically or by the solution being sprayed. The sprays are not
considered self-cleaning and sanitary because their intricate internals,
such as threaded parts, bearings and seals, are difficult to clean. Dynamic
sprays produce jet streams that help remove hardened soils; such impact is
not normally required in CIP, which is primarily chemical in nature.
Devices to detect rotation and constant supply pressure are essential for
the sprays to perform effectively.

for the actuator housings; the plug, stem seals and body gaskets are made
of Buna N, Viton, steam-resistant Viton, EPDM or butyl rubber. ``Mix
proof'' valves of similar design now provide ``double block and bleed''
capability in a single device

The personal computer has had a profound effect on access to information
for engineers throughout industry. Nevertheless, the information systems
needed to run a complex CPI plant such as a refinery have not changed:
operations management, maintenance, crisis management, warehouse,
engineering, laboratory, business, and scheduling, among others.
    Various control or data processing systems are currently used to manage
these data needs, but computer technology and business economics are
unifying these requirements into one, all-encompassing system -- the
industrial desktop computer. The industrial desktop is an evolving concept,
but at this stage, several components are clear:
  -- It is based on personal computers, or workstations that are compatible
with these computers
  -- It has ready access both to plant-floor data (the conventional purpose
of process control computers) as well as a variety of business applications
and telecommunications capabilities
  -- It makes use of the software conventions centered around Microsoft
Corp. (Redmond, Wash.)
   Engineers, plant managers and others want an industrial desktop because
it promises to give them ready access to vital information. This is
critical not just during emergencies (when, in fact, lives are at stake)
but also in the pell-mell competition to get and keep customers, to reduce
costs and to improve productivity.
   Many computer and automation vendors are making a concerted effort to
serve this technological need. At the same time, users themselves are
helping to shape it by the demands they put on equipment and software
developers.

Getting the best
The rationale for the version of the industrial desktop comes from three
sources. First, the lower cost and greater power of the latest PCs allows
workers to handle tasks that had required large, expensive computer systems
in the recent past.
   Business managers have been comfortable in equipping office workers with
this power for word processing, spreadsheets and communication. Plant
engineers, however, have not enjoyed the same benefits.   They have the
same basic requirements as the office workers plus plant-related needs.
   Second, current business conditions force manufacturers to make do with
a minimum staff. Whether fair or not, the reality is that companies are
succeeding in carrying out their duties with drastically reduced staffing.
The days when plant engineers ran plants, sales engineers sold products and
executives ran the business are passing; now all are involved with these
activities.
   Third, the current evolution of PC software points to the dominance of
one company, Microsoft, with its various Windows operating systems, and
with a growing collection of de facto protocols or conventions in how
programs should be structured. This system is supplanting older proprietary
or Unix-based programs in industrial applications, most notably in
distributed control systems. The longterm benefits of such a concentration
of, or reliance on, one company's products is debatable; what seems
indisputable is the efficiency and reliability of working today in the
Microsoft environment.

Borrow from office automation
There are similarities in the industrial desktop and the office desktop
infrastructure, but there are also differences. The similarities are
important because the industrial desktop is too small and too specialized
to generate its own applications and standards. We must ``borrow''
technology from the office environment or wherever it springs.
   The industrial desktop works for supervisors, planners, quality
managers, and many others -- each with unique informational needs.  The
industrial desktop provides a common window for all of them.
   There are five considerations when constructing the industrial desktop:
  -- Three-tier computing
  -- Scope and definition of industrial desktop computing
  -- Evolution of OLE (to be defined later) technology
  -- Single window operation
  -- Migration of legacy (old, obsolescent) systems

   Much has been written about three-tier computing in the business world,
but it is equally appropriate in industry. The philosophy, shown in Figure
1, is that the best way to manage large, complex operations is to separate
data (orders, process conditions, employee records) from applications
(scheduling, maintenance-management or training programs) and from the
presentation (the screen or text output).
   Figure 2 is a more realistic diagram of the tiers where there are
several applications, each with a database, each with an application layer
that presents its data and methods to the presentation layer, and parallel
application layers. The desktop has the presentation layer and usually uses
data and methods from  parts of the application layer.  The  application
layer makes data accessible and updates easy  while ensuring their
integrity.
   Several methods are used to generate the application layer. The concepts
that describe these methods are: the transaction processing monitor; stored
procedures; and objects. The transaction processing monitor performs a
two-phase routine to ensure that data, after an update, are still
consistent. The stored procedure allows users to update via a script or
program. The object approach hides the details of the actions from the
applications, and has advantages in the three-tier setup.
   To see how three-tier computing works in a plant, consider the example
of 24-h production, one of the most basic performance calculations. Say
there is a tank and a flow where the company needs consistent numbers for
production. This may seem easy, but now consider the dataset. There are
many questions and ambiguities in the computation for 24-h total:
  -- What flow correction is used?
  -- What is the proper time stamp of the manual inputs or lab data?
  -- How are missing data handled?
  -- How are small negative or positive numbers handled?
  -- How are redundant data used?

   It is clear that people could get many different answers while computing
the 24-h total, which could be misleading. Comparable calculations are
performed in business offices on spreadsheets, but much of this is
essentially unvalidated, unchecked program code handed from person to
person. This is clearly a problem in the office, but in the plant could
lead to  people or equipment in jeopardy.
   The role of three-tier computing is to address squarely the methods used
to present information in a consistent fashion. This has the very desirable
result of protecting the integrity of both the data and the methods by
having documented in only one place both the information and how it is
used. As configurations or data or methods change, the application layer
can implement the management of change at a single location.
    Objects are a formal method for implementing the three-tier
architecture. We can expose an interface that permits any application to
ask a question and get the same answer. In this example, what is needed is
a real-time data object with an exposed interface for calculating the 24-h
average.
   Other advantages of the three-tier architecture with objects include:
  -- Avoiding the ``fat clients.'' Many applications treat the PC as if it
were the only computer, so that if other workstations need the same data or
methods, those data or methods must be duplicated in another PC. A properly
networked system  smoothes out these burdens
  -- Minimizing bad information. With all data coming from a single source,
the likelihood of bad information being presented is far less and, if
errors are found, corrections are easier and need be done in only one
place
  -- Standardizing definitions of process information. Since there is only
one definition, inconsistencies are eliminated at the source

   The construction of a three-tier architecture to support the industrial
desktop is a big job. The ideal would be to have an agreement between
vendors so that applications share objects and methods. Microsoft has
launched a project called OPC (OLE for Process Control; CE, November 1995,
p. 53) that adds real-time objects to the Microsoft OLE environment. This
project could accelerate  cooperation on a standard.

Connecting  the desktop
Consider the analysis of an oleum spill that occurred a few years ago in an
urban area. The incident investigators determined that a helper, because of
absence of a sick operator, was elevated to operator and began loading the
tank car. The helper had no formal training in the loading procedures. A
vent that would have prevented the gas release was not used.
   The problem here was not the lack of training; it was that unplanned
changes (to accommodate an illness) and information for those making the
change did not match. The individual assigned the task did not have
sufficient training, and thus did not maintain the required level of
safety. The data were there, but lost somewhere in the plant, and not
readily available to the managers.
   Most companies are in this situation, relying on people's memory and
experience. But this does not work as organizations are downsized and these
people leave the scene. In order to avoid this problem, the workstations of
those scheduling or managing personnel need to have convenient access to
tasks, skills, procedures and equipment required in the facility.
   Consider Figure 3 as a possible hardware configuration for the
industrial desktop with a few of the possible servers commonly found:
  -- Local-area network (LAN) for files, printers, fax, modem, and so on
  -- Plantwide information management (PIM) system, for process information
and history
  -- Relational database (RDB), storing plant configurations and
``warehousing'' data
  -- Private branch exchange (PBX) -- a telephone network supporting voice
and some data-based communication. This may be complemented with a computer
telephony server to support unified messaging for fax, e-mail, phone mail
and others, remote access, call director, teleconferencing, wide-area
networks (WANs) and an Internet interface
  -- Workgroup (discussion groups, Web page, e-mail,  document database)

   It is worth noting here that even organizations that do not consider
themselves at the leading edge of information technology can already have
hundreds or thousands of workstations in place -- really a staggering
number. The surprising observation about applications for the industrial
desktop (Table) is that most of these are not on the office desktop. The
clear message is that to construct the industrial desktop for all the
thousands of users is not a single project. A continuous-improvement
implementation must be used.

Evolution of OLE technology
``Objects,'' which have been referred to several times in the text, are the
preferred way to work with computer programs these days (CE, July 1995, p.
86). An object combines data (such as a text or drawing) with instructions
on how to interpret them. There are many advantages of object technology
for developers, primarily in the reuse, rather than constant rewriting, of
code. There are also benefits to the users:
  -- Common user interface
  -- Single window presentation
  -- Migration of legacy systems

   OLE originally meant Object Linking and Embedding, and it was only able
to house an icon  that could be clicked on to launch an application. At
that time, the entire application that supported the object was launched in
order to use it. Later Microsoft began to develop software that allowed the
programs to be edited in place and this evolved to the OLE 2.0 - In Place
Activation. OLE was redefined to be a generic term for the technology
implemented with the Microsoft objects. The Microsoft definition of objects
is called COM (common object model) and DCOM (distributed COM).
   OLE technology is expanding at a rapid pace with announcements from
Microsoft. As the PC becomes part of bigger systems, OLE technology
provides a roadmap to more complex program designs.
   For forward-looking developers, OLE technology will give immediate
access to the 32-bit capabilities of the PC and, according to Microsoft,
the 64-bit VLIW (very long instruction word) technology coming with the P7.
(P7 is the next generation of microprocessor, and is being designed by a
joint venture between Hewlett Packard and Intel Corp. Due in 1997, it may
use a new design called Precision Architecture. VLIW and Precision
Architecture are both technologies to boost the speed of instruction
processing.)
   The  software features of a Microsoft OLE desktop that will greatly
influence its ``look and feel''   will be:
  -- ODBC (open database connect) data access
  -- Object manipulation (OLE Automation)
  -- Scripting

   ODBC is a nonproprietary standard supported by Microsoft and all major
database vendors. It is the ``calling mechanism'' for a way to interact
with databases called structured query language, or SQL.
   There are two enhancements that will make ODBC the standard tool for
constructing a three-tier system on the desktop and application servers:
JOIN and Stored Procedures. Microsoft added JOIN to ODBC to allow SQL
queries to use information from several different databases, local or
remote. If the batch data were in a business database and production data
were in a data historian (both supporting ODBC access across the network),
the PC can issue a query to do a JOIN between the two for reporting things
like ``get average quality vs. specification WHILE Grade = Grade X over the
last month.''
   The addition of Stored Procedure to ODBC will allow a user to create
custom applications. Data will be handled in a prescribed manner even
though they are in different databases.
   Object manipulation and scripting allow the interaction with the screen
to be ``programmed'' by the users (similar to spreadsheet macros). These
scripts are triggered by the so-called ``OLE automation events.'' The
industrial desktop then acts like a call center for plant personnel. If you
want to pop a window when there is a process alarm, the systems would have
to have an event created by the application software on change of state of
a variable, and then run a script (written in Visual Basic) to put the
window on the screen -- a very common function in workstations.
   Some of the companies providing software for industrial process control,
including ours, are in the process of obtaining Windows 95 certification.
In our case, the relevant products are  ProcessBook (a real-time database)
and PI System (a desktop interface). To reach this level, work began in
early 1993, with a beta version being tested by selected customers a year
later. A prototype of the OLE Automation version was ready in March 1995.
   But this is merely the beginning of the race that industrial software
developers must run in the next several years. Consider the number of
enhancements to the desktop that must yet be implemented:
  -- OLE DB--virtual data base including ODBC, JOIN, Stored Procedures
  -- OPC--process control including real time data
  -- Network OLE--distributed objects including security and license
management
  -- OLE TP--transaction processing
  -- OLE Across Platforms--a joint venture with Digital Equipment Corp. for
a Corba port of OLE (Corba is the Unix equivalent of OLE)
  -- OLE for Enterprise--a project with Texas Instruments for object
registry
  -- OLE Office--compound documents, binders, office elements
  -- WOSA--class libraries for real time access
  -- TAPI--class libraries for telephony
  -- CAD--class libraries for drafting
  -- GIS--class libraries for geographical information systems
  -- DNS--class libraries for distributed name services

 . . . and there are more every month.
   Clearly the work will be beyond the capabilities of any one company.
Those with the manpower and capital may not have the expertise and vice
versa.
   Component software is the answer to this situation. If a good
infrastructure for the industrial desktop is created, and it adheres
rigidly to the Microsoft standards in the form of the ``Designed for
Windows 95'' logo certification program, smaller companies will be able to
create OLE controls for the applications in the Table. Those controls can
be pasted into the industrial desktop using OLE Automation and OLE Visual
Basic Scripting. All this innovation should come at a relatively low price 
-- probably less than $1,000 per end user.

A window on the process
Nearly everyone using PCs today is familiar with the ``look and feel'' of a
common window environment. Each screen looks more or less the same;
commands are in the same places; and different programs use many of the
same command conventions. Even when a user completely inexperienced in a
new application opens a window, he or she can readily navigate through the
program.
   Windows (of all types, not just Microsoft's) have been a common feature
of PCs since the late 1980s. At about the same time, the engineering
workstation market (which has historically been based on the Unix operating
system) adopted the ``X Window'' protocol to provide user interfaces
comparable to those of PCs.
   PC users are familiar with having multiple windows open, running
different applications. The situation is different in the process control
field. As systems (each with different windowing standards) began to
proliferate, it became clear that operators did not want to learn many
different ways to interact with a system. Some of the design parameters for
operator consoles are that operators can only learn 1.5 - 2 different
interactive systems.
   This shows the lunacy of building special screens that are not normally
used, and  that only require actions during high-stress emergencies that
will lower both of these numbers. A better design goal is the single
window, but we have not always provided this. The evolution has been:
  -- Multiple terminals, single room (for example, the centralized control
room)
  -- Multiple windows, single box (console furniture integration)
  -- Multiple look and feel, single screen (X Window)
  -- Single look and feel, single screen (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
  -- Single look and feel, single screen, single interoperable applications
(OLE)

   The advantages of the single window are clear:
  -- Cost
  -- Training
  -- Speed of access and familiarity in emergencies
  -- Quality of applications
  -- Reduced redundancy of function
  -- Simplicity for developers, allowing them to concentrate on
applications

   To provide a single window, there must be not only a common platform,
but also a common look and feel, common support and common object
definition. This is the reason that the X Window convention has not been
satisfying to the users. To get the applications that they wanted (e.g.,
Excel) required a different terminal.
   Another weakness was the lack of a graphical user-interface standard.
Two X applications do not need to have a constant look and feel or even
permit a cut and paste between them. In some cases, such as Kanji
characters in Japan, they do not use the same character sets and cannot see
the text from another workstation even if the cut and paste were allowed.
   The Microsoft OLE Technology provides us an opportunity to build that
common look and feel -- essentially plagiarizing the consensus developed
for the office desktop.

Migration of legacy systems
In order to succeed, we must address squarely how to migrate the legacy
applications that exist today in a plant.
   With a bit of poetic license on the spelling, we have the three R's:
  -- wRap
  -- Reengineer
  -- Replace

   With the approach proposed in PlantSuite*, this can be done as part of
an evolutionary improvement cycle and not in one, disruptive project. To
understand how to replace legacy systems, we have to know why they are
legacy systems in the first place. It could be one or more of the
following:
  -- Old technology that is hard to maintain
  -- Systems containing much information that cannot be shared
  -- Systems having older, one- or two-tier design instead of three-tier

   It may be surprising to management, but many new systems fit these
criteria -- usually as a result of the wrong focus as the old organization
tries to perpetuate itself. The key to replacing legacy systems is to keep
a focused, long-term vision to guide the short-term implementation with a
system flexible enough to accommodate the change. Today, we have an
environment that would seem  to remain constant for the next five years:
Microsoft OLE technology.
   Most legacy systems of any age contain vital information used for
running the plant, so simple replacement by new systems is not an option.
In a modern system, objects are chosen (e.g., people, positions,
procedures) and the methods they need to support are defined (for example:
Given a person, for which tasks is he or she current?).
   If these data are in a legacy system, then an interface must be written
to extract them. The key is to properly expose (or ``wrap'') the data and
methods. For example once information is obtained using OLE DB for a SQL
access, SQL JOIN or Stored Procedure, it can be exposed to the desktop
using standard software.
   Reengineering of the systems so that the methods are exposed to the
desktop is an example of three-tier design. The data buried in legacy
systems can be accessed using tools to extract the methods and data to a
separate layer (another type of wrap) and then exposed to the desktop. As
each application is completed, the number of objects should stabilize and
it will become clear what are needed to support the business processes.
   There are four challenges to create this design:
  -- The system must be able to see information in a consistent manner from
any data source
  -- It must be able to perform a JOIN between data regardless of physical
location
  -- The system must be able to execute stored procedures that may use
information from many different data sources
  -- Once the result is obtained, it must be presented to the industrial
desktop in a standard manner

   This is almost precisely the description of the ODBC service in the OLE
DB class libraries that are part of the Microsoft OLE Technology.
   Once the wrap and reengineer are complete, replacement becomes easier.
If the redesigned system is well supported, it will, by continuous
improvement, evolve into the system required by the organization. Support
is a key driving force for this change. If the only support comes from
people who simply maintain the manuals or are interrupted at their normal
job, then there is no support. A dedicated support team is necessary.
   The industrial desktop is real and is critical to business. It is
integral to the movement of information, and generation and acceleration of
an innovative environment for businesses. This can be a strategic advantage
for companies that support their plant personnel with the same automation
tools as the office workers.

PROCESS CONTROL IMPROVEMENT VIA DISCOVERY
A careful assessment of control requirements brings longer-lasting
benefits

By:
Joel M. Vardy, The Foxboro Company
Edited by Nicholas Basta


Traditionally, process control has been viewed as an important subcategory
within production management. Process lines need to be controlled to move
raw materials in and finished goods out, and the control system has evolved
to carry out this critical function reliably.
   Today, however, the rapid advances in information technology are making
process control systems even more important to the overall performance of a
manufacturer. Better software and more-powerful yet less-expensive
hardware allow managers to use the control system as a competitive tool --
a source of data, a means to cut costs, and a method to reduce production
cycles and meet customer timetables.
   Wise application of this tool will require all the techniques taught in
engineering school, along with business methods borrowed from other
disciplines. Moreover, plant managers are finding that as control
strategies grow more comprehensive, they are working more closely with
other parts of the business -- sales and marketing executives, safety and
environmental managers, and corporate management.

Another way
This situation makes the design and selection of control technology a more
complex issue than simply comparing cost, capability and reliability. A
different method of evaluating these factors is proposed -- the Discovery
Process.
    To make it all clear, the hypothetical example of Acme Chemical Co.,
and the events that transpired at it over a year-long period, will be
examined. Acme's story, while containing bits and pieces of actual events,
is fictitious.
   Acme has been a good, middle-of-the-road manufacturer, with several
plants spread across the U.S. midwest and south, as well as newer plants in
Europe and Asia. One of the plants, on the Gulf coast, is called
LargeAcres.
   Headquarters has been downsizing to adapt to competitive realities and
realign along business units that manage the global product lines.
LargeAcres has until recently avoided the downsizing due to the strength of
its product lines. Unfortunately, the market has shifted in the last 3
years and the plant is already operating with less than 85% of its original
workforce. Important workers at LargeAcres are:
  -- Harry, the area manager for both Unit 4 (producing Monomer A) and -- a
more recent consolidation -- Unit 5 (producing Polymer B -- Figure 1). The
combined responsibility was a recent change in staff structure
  -- The process engineer for Unit 4, Charlie, has been ill lately, yet is
quite knowledgeable about the original operation. He was nearing retirement
and his health problems were sometimes interfering with his duties though
the plant was now running pretty lean with few options for back-filling his
position. Plant Management was weighing its options in light of the
situation.
  -- Jim, the plant manager, has generally been pleased with how well his
units had been performing, in spite of attrition due to staff cutbacks. Jim
was also mindful of an upcoming announcement that LargeAcres had to reduce
its costs by 10% or risk shutting down the Polymer Unit, which in turn
would put more pressure on the Monomer Unit to find new markets or face
additional cost pressure. Jim was in daily communication with corporate
planners.
  -- Also important in the ongoing functions of Jim's plant are Jane, the
R&D manager, and Kathy, the environmental, safety and health (ESH)
administrator assigned to his unit. Jane had been growing increasingly
worried about the lack of consistency between the laboratory QC programs
and actual data from production units. Kathy had just been brought in from
corporate, where she wrote some of the company's new safety policies.
   During a Monday staff meeting, after the production numbers were
reviewed, Jim requested that Harry and other area managers begin a new
program to evaluate instrumentation.
   ``What exactly is this all about, Jim?'' asked Harry. ``We have an
ongoing program to repair and upgrade obsolete instrumentation as you know.
We seem to get a fraction of upgrades done every year, limited mostly by
budgets and sometimes by the time available during shutdown periods.''
   ``Yes, Harry, and you've done an admirable job of keeping the program
going,'' admitted Jim. ``But corporate has noticed that the predicted
savings from new instrumentation never seem to get delivered, and that it
has been getting tougher each year for our Pilot operation to replicate our
results here.''
   ``Jim, you know as well as anyone here how often corporate falls on
their faces when it comes to practical stuff like tying their own
shoelaces. If I have a theoretical problem for them to solve I'll be the
first to give them a holler. We've always been able to solve our own stuff
without their interference.''
   ``I know, Harry. But times are different now. We don't have all the
horsepower we once had, and with Charlie ill and all, I just feel it's time
we figure out how to work with those corporate guys,'' said Jim. ``Let's
look at the reinstrumentation project as an opportunity for some
cooperation. Give it a shot and we'll see what happens. What do you say,
Harry?''
   ``All right, but I sure wish things were back to the way they were, even
though my head says that isn't possible,'' said Harry. ``We'll give it a
shot.''

The unexplained runaway
As tends to happen everywhere on Friday afternoons, what can go wrong does
-- and at the worst time. A near-fatal accident occurs that sets in motion
a process that dramatically changes how LargeAcres operates, and what
control systems it uses.
   That day, Harry gets a call about an unexpected, and unexplainable,
incident. Apparently, an operator had opened the reactor hatch on Unit 5 to
take a sample, and was almost doused with high temperature resin, which
would have surely severely injured if not killed him. The incident was
reported immediately since it also caused some damage to the reactor and
surrounding vessels. Pressure had built up without sufficient warning and
several safety systems, including the vent, had failed to relieve the
situation.
   Harry called for an immediate meeting to start the investigation and
alerted Jim. Jim decided to convene a special meeting Saturday morning of
his staff, the Unit 5 Engineers and Lead Operators, and Kathy.
   Harry didn't waste any time putting Kathy on the spot. ``Kathy, it
doesn't seem like your policy changes have kept this potentially fatal
incident from occurring with one of my best operators on the second shift.
What do you recommend we do now?''
   Newly appointed to the ESH position, Kathy knew that she would be tested
by production managers like Harry. She was also aware of the basic conflict
between them. Production managers are concerned with maintaining operation,
while corporate staff had to ensure safe operations and no corner-cutting.
   ``Clearly, we need to organize an investigation team, and it has to run
fast,'' she replied. She suggested several operations and engineering
people to fill out the team. Jim concurred.
   Kathy also suggested adding representatives of the two instrument
vendors that LargeAcres used, because there seemed to be some information
gaps in the overall control strategy. Harry resisted this, saying that the
team didn't have time to analyze everything yet maintain production; he
wanted to resolve safety issues quickly.
   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said Jim. ``Let's do it Kathy's
way, and keep to a tight schedule.''

The investigation
Four weeks passed with results coming in from R&D, the local team and the 
investigators from the two instrument vendors, GoodData and InfoControl
(InfoCon). Jane's R&D group was unable to determine the root cause of the
incident. It determined that without better process data too much was left
to speculation to be certain. There was a lack of consistency in the
stories from the operators and the engineers. GoodData proposed a new
control system to upgrade the existing one and replace the competition's
hardware. InfoCon made a totally different proposal.
   Michelle, the local account manager for InfoCon, had been working with
Harry to help him with the routine instrumentation projects on Unit 4. In
order to proceed, she was going to propose a ``Discovery Process'' to
determine appropriate next steps.
   She explained that the process is a scoping exercise that looks at the
economic and technical driving forces in use. It is helpful in uncovering
missing pieces of complex engineering puzzles. These pieces reside with
individuals in the plant, and with corporate or industry benchmarks (which
can be brought to light by the instrument vendors that may have seen
similar problems with customers), or other research.
   The key is to bring all the parties together to solve the puzzles and
brainstorm practical solutions for implementation. Economics are developed
for each approach at a budgetary or near budgetary-level of detail.
   Kathy and Harry sat down with the team to evaluate the options,
including the proposals for reinstrumenting the plant. The proposal from
GoodData was traditional and safe, and was favored by Harry and Charlie,
who had just returned from sick leave. Kathy favored the Discovery
approach. Harry was not set against Discovery, but feared excessive
disruption to production. He frankly wanted to just ``get on with it.''
After presentations from the vendors, Jim made the ``go'' decision to
work with InfoCon.
   Michelle explained what the process would entail: Acme and InfoCon would
co-sponsor a 2-1/2 day meeting to explore the process that is most in need
of attention. The first half-day would be used for training and setting
expectations with the team. This meeting could be followed up with other
sessions to explore other problems. Now, the primary objective would be to
produce a safer operation; a secondary objective would be to reduce
operating costs.
    The team needed a trained facilitator, an application engineer, a
project manager, the InfoCon account manager, relevant process and project
engineers, and the lead operators who knew the process best.
   ``Let's go ahead and schedule it for the earliest convenient date,''
said Jim. ``I'll help kickoff the meeting with objectives and review the
results at the end of the session.'' The meeting was scheduled for the
following Monday through Wednesday and it was deemed desirable to hold it
offsite at a nearby hotel. The process consisted of 12 steps:
  -- 1. Map the physical process, similar to an executive flow diagram
  -- 2. Superimpose the procedures commonly done by the successful
operators
  -- 3. Identify any missing pieces of information
  -- 4. Identify information dependencies from the rest of the operation
  -- 5. Identify best practices
  -- 6. Identify major concerns -- in this case, a lack of appropriate
process
    information
  -- 7. List all the identified best practices and concerns
  -- 8. Brainstorm ways to overcome the concerns using a user-vendor team
  -- 9. Evaluate the economics of equipment purchases, operational changes
and
    process cost savings
  -- 10. Create next steps and assignments
  -- 11. Review the exercise with management and other related process
owners
  -- 12. Integrate other teams' efforts

   Figure 2 depicts the approach, which borrows from workflow studies and
computer analysis. It is being treated as an adaptation to instrumentation
and control concepts due to the heavy reliance on the information flows in
today's operations. The gap created by this process is the driving force
between existing operations and the desired state of a future view.
   The multi-step implementation plan is a practical scheme for closing the
gap in a timely and cost-effective manner. Each of the steps is analyzed,
and costs and benefits are reestablished during implementation. In other
words, lessons learned from the first step of implementation are used to
evaluate the next step as the process continues through to final
development.
   As the team, led by the facilitator, went through the steps of the
process, a number of surprising conclusions surfaced. Most significantly,
the full team uncovered process conditions that could lead to safety
problems. Although process-safety meetings had been running more or less
continuously for years, the problem had not been revealed. The previous
evaluations had focused primarily on known data, conditions and procedures,
and not on unknown or unforeseen conditions.
   Another surprising result was that a whole host of long-term or vaguely
understood corporate goals were found to be of vital importance in how the
project was scoped out. For example, it was known that corporate management
was in a multi-year program to switch to a new type of business software,
which would require different types of operating systems and communication
links. But no one figured that these changes would affect production
management anytime soon, and therefore they had been ignored. Now, in
analyzing the interconnection of the future business and control software,
the team realized that not only did they have a fast track to implementing
the expected changes, they also had a powerful incentive to offer
management to justify the capital expenditure.

Presenting the results
When the Acme team members were ready to present their findings to Jim,
they made a list of the potential benefits of a revamped control system.
These would form the basis of recommended capital expenditures and services
if their plans were accepted:
  -- 1. A top-to-bottom review of operating procedures showed where
existing data was insufficient to plan procedures. An upgraded system would
be able to generate these data
  -- 2. The consequences of changing raw-material supplies were worked out.
When impurity levels change, the reaction speed is dramatically affected,
and side reactions occur. New instrumentation, and a data link between 
Jane's R&D laboratory and the production units, correct this situation
  -- 3. Document management, involving both the laboratory and the
production unit, could be upgraded by having a real-time link. When
impurity levels change, the system would be able to provide access to
stored laboratory data and documents for safety purposes
  -- 4. A long-term corporate goal of switching to another type of business
software, running on a different operating system, could be addressed.
Previously, the managers had expected that they would be the last to be
affected by the switchover; now they were in a position to be the first
production unit to take advantage of the software
  -- 5. Another production engineering goal, to consider the impact of new
industry data-communication standards, was shown to be a significant factor
in rationalizing the control strategies and updating control software. In
particular, the contents of the SP88 standard (CE, October 1995, p. 118)
would provide better management of batch recipes.
   ``We have been operating in LargeAcres in somewhat of a fog these last
few years,'' said Harry, in his concluding presentation. ``Our safety
mis-hap has opened the door to taking a fresh look at these topics.''

Six months later
In reviewing the records of plant operations since the accident, Jim found
many benefits, some of them not predicted. Customers are pleased that Acme
can meet its product schedules and changes. With the new batch management
software, control of inventory is enhanced, demurrage charges (for tankcars
held in storage) was reduced, and energy consumption was down.
   As Jim thought about all the improvements that he was seeing in plant
operations, he realized that the source was partly new technology --
especially the standardized, open software that allows better communication
among control and management systems, and partly a new way of analyzing
plant conditions that emerged during the Discovery Process. Because the
Process revealed new steps between ``things as they are'' and ``things as
they should be,'' Acme was able to take a leap forward in automation
technology, rather than the piecemeal approach of the past.

DON'T TAKE PIPE JOINTS FOR GRANTED
Paying close attention to flange bolts and welding methods can

In many respects, piping and tubing components are among the most reliable
parts of a process plant. However, pipe connections can be expensive to
install and may create crevices or ridges inside the pipe, which can
threaten sanitary conditions, or increase maintenance between batches.
   And, unless properly installed, many pipe connections offer potential
pathways for valuable, hazardous or toxic fluids to escape. During the
installation of flanged connections, flanges are typically bolted together
until a seasoned mechanic feels the connection is ``tight enough.'' Some
mechanics may use a torque wrench to ensure correct, uniform bolt
tightness. ``Bolted, flanged joints are always based on a specified bolt
load,'' says George Sturdevant, President of Houston-based Fastorq Bolting
Systems, Inc. ``But, what is often missing in the specification is how that
bolt load is to be achieved, and how the joint is to be inspected.''
   While a torque wrench is helpful in achieving the proper bolt loading,
the relationship between torque and bolt load is often poorly understood,
as it is a function of several hard-to-measure flange and bolt
characteristics, including friction, fit, finish, and lubricity. To avoid
flange leakage due to incorrect bolt loading, many joints include large
safety factors.
   Welding, although labor intensive, is often the least expensive way to
join pipes, but it creates permanent connections that need to be cut if the
pipe must be entered later. Where welded connections are desired, the use
of automatic welding machines is on the rise, says David Dodge, a
marketing manager at Dimetrics, Inc. (Davidson, N.C.), particularly in the
food, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries. ``Automatic welding
machines produce a smooth, flush internal bead, which eliminates crevices
where contamination could collect,'' he adds.
   In addition to producing welds of consistent quality at faster speeds
than manual welding, these machines provide a permanent record of the
operating conditions that took place when each weld was made. However, the
cost and setup time required to use automatic welding may limit its use.
   ``Manual welding is still often the most cost-effective method,'' says
Steve Burkel, President of Applied Energy Systems (Malvern, Pa.). As a rule
of thumb, he suggests that for pipe diameters up to about 8 in., about 10
or more identical welds would have to be performed for the automatic
welding machine to be more cost-effective. ``But for large, heavy-walled
pipe, or where clearance is restricted, or where an excess heat input is
required to control stress crack corrosion at the weld, automatic welding
may be appropriate for a single weld.''

Adding layers of protection
In recent years, the use of plastic-lined pipe has grown among process
operators. Many vendors have introduced bent piping systems that require
fewer flanged connections. Firms announcing recent product improvements
include Dow Plastic-Lined Piping Products (Bay City, Mich.), Crane
Resistoflex (Marion, N.C.) and Houston-based Performance Plastic Products
(see Removing joints from plastic-lined pipe, CE, November 1995, pp.
37-41).
   To join such systems, special plastic-lined flanges are bolted together.
With the launch of its new Conquest product line last month, Dow
Plastic-Lined Piping Products introduced a system that relies on mechanical
couplings instead of flanged connnections. These mechanical couplings can
be made in the field, and provide permanent connections that eliminate
leakage paths, and reduce ongoing maintenance.
   A variety of piping products are described below. These include lined
pipe systems, plastic tubing, high-alloy pipe for highly aggressive and
high-temperature applications, and a variety of accessories, including
quick-connects, seals for pressure testing and line isolation, and
expansion joints.

CORROSION: PREVENTION AND PROTECTION
New materials and new monitors battle equipment decay

The experienced corrosion engineer knows that corrosion tables from
handbooks and manufacturer's literature should be used for screening, not
selection. The data presented in those tables cannot possibly consider all
the process conditions that can influence corrosion rates.
    Actual performance of metals in corrosive service can often surprise
the most experienced corrosion specialist. Trace impurities (for example,
halogens) can produce corrosion rates substantially above the predictions
of corrosion charts and handbooks. Process upsets can also create brief
periods of composition changes that produce excessive corrosion rates.
   Erosion can also enhance corrosion. Many alloy metals rely on a passive
oxide coating to protect the base metal. If this coating is continually
eroded away by an abrasive slurry, a metal that would be virtually
corrosion free in a clean solution can corrode very rapidly.
   To prevent the unexpected corrosion failure of process equipment and to
test the performance of possible alternative alloys, many chemical plants
are monitoring actual process corrosion rates. ``Corrosion monitoring tools
range from very simple test coupons to very sophisticated instruments with
feedback controls,'' explains Dennis Pritchard, a vice president at Metal
Samples Co. (Munford, Ala.)
   Monitoring corrosion with test coupons consists of placing a small wafer
of the metal in the process stream and removing it periodically to check
for weight loss. These coupons can be inserted through a double valve
system, so the process need not be shut down to inspect the coupons. For
more frequent readings of corrosion rate, an electrical conductivity probe
can be installed in the process. Constructed of the metal being tested, the
probe gradually loses metal as corrosion proceeds. The drop in electrical
conductivity is directly related to corrosion rate.
   ``Conductivity probes can be highly sophisticated,'' notes Pritchard.
``They can provide a continuous readout of corrosion rate which, when
coupled with other process variables such as pH and temperature, allow the
engineer to determine how a metal fares under changing operating
conditions.'' He also notes that conductivity probes are often used as the
independent variable in control loops to adjust pH or add corrosion
inhibitors.

Redundant tests add flexibility
While corrosion coupons are generally considered more reliable than
conductivity probes, Jim Tauscher, a technician at Tennessee Eastman Div.,
Eastman Chemical Co. (Kingsport, Tenn.) finds the probes provide more rapid
indication of potential problems. ``We install coupons and conductivity
probes together in the process stream,'' he explains. ``When the probe
signals high metal loss, we check metal thickness of the vessel or pipe.
Usually, the probe predicts actual metal loss quite well.''
   Two additional tips come from Tauscher's experience. First, he finds
that laboratory tests of corrosion rates aren't nearly as reliable as using
in-process test coupons or conductivity probes. And second, he finds that
continuous recordings of corrosion rates often uncover upstream process
upsets that may otherwise go undetected.
   Alloy availability is often overlooked when studying alloy performance.
As Alan Gamble, president of Alloy Tech Inc. (Salem, N.H.), notes, ``Of all
the different alloys and shapes that can be made, few are actually
available from distributors. Unless you're willing to buy a large quantity
directly from the mill, and wait for the mill to make it, testing should
only be done on materials that you know meet your availability
requirements.''
   Some corrosive applications, such as acidic fluegases, lend themselves
to highly specific corrosion monitors. Designed to identify conditions that
create acidic condensation on the walls of the stack, the monitors can
provide data that help optimize combustion and heat utilization while
protecting the flue ducts.
    While a metal or metal alloy can usually be found that will handle a
corrosive application, plastic should also be considered when the pressure
and temperature are moderate. Plastic can often cost less, and provide less
potential for contaminating the process with corrosion products. This is
especially true for containment applications.
   The items below include plastic equipment, linings and coatings -- using
both thermoplastic and thermoset resins -- designed for aggressive
environments.

PORTABLE FLANGE REFACER CAN BE SET UP IN 15 MINUTES

The Climax Model FF20, weighing only 60 lb, can reface flanges in the
field, for pipes with diameters from 5 to 20 in. With only two pieces, the
machine can be set up by a single mechanic in minutes. Using a right-angle
mount for the air motor, the compact unit extends just 7 in. above the
flange when in use. Its 1.2-hp air motor and 28.2:1 gear reduction combine
to produce 150 ft-lb of torque at the cutter, allowing nearly any type of

MAKE YOUR PROCESS WATER PAY FOR ITSELF
Pinch technology can be harnessed to minimize raw-water demand and
wastewater generation alike

By:
Vikas R. Dhole, Nand Ramchandani, Richard A. Tainsh, and Marek Wasilewski
Linnhoff March Ltd.
Edited by Nicholas P. Chopey


Environmental protection, rising costs for wastewater-treatment, and at
many sites a shortage of fresh water are all persuasive motives for
reducing raw water consumption and wastewater discharge at a
chemical-process plant. Maximizing the re-use of water within the plant can
be of great help. Systematic strategies for such maximization can lower
freshwater usage and wastewater discharges by 50% or more, while also
significantly reducing capital investment in treatment facilities.
   The typical base case or starting point for such improvements appears in
Figure 1, which shows a conventional water network in a process plant.
After undergoing initial treatment, the incoming water goes in parallel
streams to the various individual process units, as well as to the utility
system for steam production and for use in cooling towers. Wastewater
streams from the processes, along with blowdown and condensate losses from
the utility system, are usually collected together and the combined stream
fed to a wastewater treatment facility prior to discharge.

The options available
There are two basic strategies for reducing water demand in such a plant.
One strategy consists of modifying individual process and utility units to
reduce their inherent need for water. Examples include replacing water
cooling with air cooling, improving controls of boiler and cooling-tower
blowdowns, and increasing the number of stages in an extraction unit that
employs water as its extractant.
   In the other basic strategy, which is the main focus of this article,
the engineer seeks opportunities to use the outlet water from one operation
to satisfy the water requirement of another or the same operation. In some
cases, the water may require some regeneration prior to re-use. Examples of
regeneration include pH adjustment, filtration, membrane separation,
sour-water stripping and ion exchange.
   Unfortunately, such attempts to lower freshwater use and wastewater
generation are usually carried out piecemeal: Designs of individual units
are improved and water-reuse opportunities acted upon without considering
the overall plant as a whole. Now, however, newer approaches are available
in which all of the plant's process and utility units can be systematically
treated as one entity [2,3,4].

Early focus on mass transfer
All such systematic approaches known to us include elements of pinch
technology [1]. Increasingly used in the process industries since the early
1980s, the initial embodiment of pinch technology offers a way to solve
complex multi-stream heat integration problems by converting stream data
into a visual representation on temperature and enthalpy axes. As there are
parallels between heat transfer and mass transfer, the established
principles of thermal pinch analysis can be extended to fresh- and
wastewater minimization.
   The first moves in that direction came in 1989, when El-Halwagi and
Manousiouthakis at the University of California, Los Angeles [2] addressed
a more general problem of mass exchange between a set of rich process
streams and a set of lean streams. Five years later, Wang and Smith at the
University of Manchester [England] Institute of Science and Technology [3]
specifically addressed the water-minimization problem, by considering it as
a contamination-transfer problem from process streams to water streams.
   Both of these approaches are based on the model of a process unit as a
mass-transfer unit (Figure 2): Contaminant moves from the rich process
stream to the water stream. The mass- transfer driving force is indicated
by the gap between the process and water stream profiles plotted on
concentration and mass-transferred axes.
   Focus your attention for a moment on the Wang and Smith approach.
Although space limitations do not permit a usable, step-by-step
explanation, the first task consists of developing a limiting water profile
for each water-using process operation, based on maximum inlet and outlet
concentrations for the water stream for each operation.
   The limiting water-stream concentrations of all the process units are
combined together to construct the limiting composite curve for the overall
plant. A fresh-water line is then constructed, and matched against the
limiting composite curve to set the minimum fresh-water demand for the
overall plant (Figure 3a).
   The minimum-fresh-water line touches the limiting composite curve at two
points: at zero concentration and at an intermediate position called the
pinch point. This line, which corresponds to the minimum water flowrate
required for the plant, establishes the ``target'' for maximizing water
re-use. The limiting composite curve construction also shows critical
sections of the plant (regions close to pinch concentration) that require
especially close attention in order to achieve the minimum water
requirement.
   To develop the water-reuse network that minimizes the fresh-water
demand, the Wang and Smith approach uses network-design methodology
analogous to the pinch design method from heat integration. The initial
network thus obtained tends to have a complex structure, but an
evolutionary procedure then simplifies this to yield a practical network
(Figure 3b).
   Unfortunately, the sequence as just described deals with only one
contaminant. Accounting for multiple contaminants requires more-complex
construction of limiting composite curves, as well as more-involved network
design [3].
   Another drawback to the approach is its use of contaminant mass transfer
as the basis for modeling. Many process units, such as reactors, boilers
and cooling towers, cannot readily be described as contaminant mass
transfer units.
   Furthermore, it is difficult to model situations, not uncommon in
process plants, in which several water-based streams enter and leave the
process unit at different concentrations. And, the approach does not
directly address practical constraints such as geographical distances (long
pipe runs) and other constraints that may forbid re-use of water from one
unit to another.
   In spite of these practical problems, the Wang and Smith approach has
served as the pioneering tool for water minimization. We ourselves have
employed it on projects of this type. Furthermore, that experience gave us
the basis for developing a newer approach for wastewater minimization that
overcomes the problems outlined above.

Two composite plots
In this approach, each relevant process or utility operation within the
overall plant is considered as having aqueous input and output streams.
There can be several of each, at different purities, in a single operation.
The approach involves a combination of new graphical and mathematical
techniques, and is trademarked WaterPinch.
   The graphical procedure is analogous to the familiar method from pinch
technology [1]. The engineer can plot the input aqueous streams of all
relevant operations into a combined ``demand composite'' form, on a graph
having purity as its vertical axis and aqueous-stream flowrate as its
horizontal axis. This composite defines the water demands, in terms of
required input purities for the individual streams, for the overall plant.
Similarly the output water streams of all the operations can be plotted to
construct the ``source composite'' for the plant, defined in terms of the
minimum output purities of the individual streams.
   An example for a plant having five process units appears in Figure 4.
Note that the numbers on the vertical axis increase downward, not upward --
that is, purity is measured in terms of the amount of contamination
present, with the zero-contamination point (i.e., the highest purity)
occupying the highest point on the vertical axis and the concentration
numbers representing successively greater contamination descending along
the scale. Note also that the supply and demand composites are overlapped
until they just avoid a crossover, and thus define the ``pinch point''
between the two composites.
   As an example of how the individual line segments of the composites are
plotted, consider first Segment A on the water-sources composite. It
represents a stream leaving Process Unit A whose flowrate is 43 tons/h (as
shown by its length, i.e., 130 2 87 measured against the horizontal axis)
and whose contaminant level is 70 ppm (as measured against the vertical
axis). Similarly, Segment B represents a stream of 48 tons/h (178 2 130
against the horizontal axis) leaving Process Unit B, with a contaminant
level of 47 ppm. As for Segment C on the water-demands composite, it
represents Process Unit C's requirement for 106 tons/h (238 2 132) of water
whose contaminant level is no higher than 65 ppm.
   The overlap between the source and the demand composite, shown by the
shaded area, indicates the potentialities for water reuse. The available
overlap is limited by the pinch point. The representation in Figure 4 also
identifies targets for minimum fresh water demand and wastewater
generation.
   The pinch point and the composite curves help to identify design
improvements in an existing plant. In the first place, the sources should
provide water to demands on the same side of the pinch. Flow of water from
a source above the pinch to a demand below the pinch will increase the
consumption beyond the target. Using fresh water to satisfy demands below
the pinch, or sending water from sources above the pinch to waste
treatment, will have the same effect.
   The representation also helps the engineer identify design modifications
that can further improve the targets for a plant. Figure 5 shows an
example. By mixing Streams A and B described in Figure 4, we can generate a
91-ton/h stream of intermediate purity (58 ppm), shown as ``Mix'' in Figure
5a. Because this stream is pure enough to satisfy part of the Segment C
demand for 106 tons/h of 65-ppm (or purer) water, the pinch-point
bottleneck shown in Figure 4 is relieved, allowing further overlap of the
source and demand composites and increasing the overall water recovery in
the process.
   The diagram also provides specific design guidelines to maximize the
re-use of water, as shown in Figure 5b. For example, it indicates that the
water mixture from outlets of units A and B needs to supply water to unit
C, and that the remaining water demand for unit C can be satisfied by part
of the water outlet from unit D.
   The visual representation typified by Figures 4 and 5 can also be
presented and manipulated via an equivalent mathematical model. The model
enables the user to deal with complex water networks, having multiple
contaminants and large number of process operations. For such problems the
user may find it easier to start with the mathematical model and then
visualize the simplified solutions.
   Use of the model also lets the engineer take into account certain
practical issues for which the visual representation would be irrelevant.
Examples include geographical and operability constraints, and varying
costs of fresh waters and of wastewater treatment.
   The mathematical model is completely compatible with the visual
representation: The user can switch between mathematical and visual modes
at any stage. The two are also complementary, the visual tool improving
engineering understanding and the mathematical model allowing the handling
of complex problems.

to the improved process configuration that appears in Figure 5b

A REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE
The capabilities of water minimization can better be appreciated by
considering the results from a recent project involving Monsanto PLC at
Newport, Gwent, Wales [7].
   Up to now, effluents from seven process plants at the complex have been
collected together, and the resulting mixture adjusted for pH and then
discharged along an outflow into the River Severn estuary. Recently, the
U.K.'s National Rivers Authority indicated that the resulting discharge
levels are not acceptable in the long term. Accordingly, Monsanto decided
to reduce discharged COD by 90%. Doing so via a conventional, centralized
treatment system would have required capital outlays of $15 million.
   However, applying the WaterPinch approach has revealed that the site's
fresh-water consumption could be cut by 30%. The resulting decrease in
effluent volume significantly lowers the required size of the treatment
facility. What's more, process changes suggested by the water-minimization
study reduce the COD load by 76%.
   As a result, the required capital expenditure has shrunk to $3.5
million. Additional benefits include a savings of $300,000/yr in
fresh-water cost and $700,000/yr in raw materials that would have been 
lost in the effluent from the larger treatment plant. As a result of the
project, Monsanto and Linnhoff March won the 1995 TCE Excellence in Safety
and Environment award bestowed by the Institution of Chemical Engineers,
U.K.

DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGE FILTERS SIZING UP
The choice of the optimum filter depends on factors such as flow
conditions, fluid viscosity and size of the solid contaminants

By:
Joseph Swiezbin, Tony Uberoi and Jane J. Janas, Pall Corp.
Edited by Deborah Hairston


The filtration spectrum spans a broad range of contaminant types and
particle sizes that can be selectively removed from a fluid or gas via a
porous medium [1]. Within this domain, several separation processes are
available, from reverse osmosis to particle filtration (Table 1).
   At the top of the spectrum is the ionic range -- where hyperfiltration
techniques are used for removal of particles smaller than 0.001 m. An
example is reverse osmosis, a membrane diffusion process. In this process,
pressure is applied to solutions of low-molecular-weight solutes in contact
with a membrane. By use of solution-diffusion mechanisms, a solution lower
in solute concentration is produced.
   To remove higher-mass particles, coarser particles in the molecular
range, ultrafiltration is specified. Ultrafilters, which clarify colloids
in the range of 0.002-0.02 m, are used. While reverse osmosis requires
pressure up to 600 psi, ultrafilters operate with pressure on the order of
50 psi.
   Microfiltration and particle filtration, for clarification of
contaminants in the range of 0.01-120 m, can be accomplished with
disposable filter elements, which are designed as bag or cartridge
configurations. This article focuses on the selection of disposable
cartridge filters. Less expensive and more convenient than cleanable
filters, cartridge filters should be carefully matched with the product
being filtered to achieve the desired results. Specifying the optimum
filter will help meet product specifications and potentially avoid future
processing problems.
   Cartridge filters typically consists of a porous medium, in a pleated or
depth style, supported by a core. Many standard filters are built in
multiple lengths of 10 in., with an outside dia. of 2.5 or 2.75 in. A
depth-style cartridge has a thick, continuous filter medium that may be:
  -- String wound. Typically does not have a fixed pore structure and may
release contaminants under differential pressure load
  -- Molded fiber. Has a fixed pore structure, is flow resistant, and
compared with other styles of depth filters, may have a lower service life
  -- High-efficiency depth filter. Typically has a fixed-pore structure,
possesses a continuously graded prefilter layer and constant-pore diameter
section, features uniform compressibility and density, high voids volume,
and typically has a long service life

   A pleated-style cartridge features a filter medium that is folded into
pleats that may be:
  -- Triangular-shaped. Geometrically fold-ed sheets of medium
  -- Crescent-shaped. Slightly curved to provide the advantages of both
triangular-pleated and high-efficiency depth-style media

   When, as is typical, the particle concentration is low -- less than 100
ppm or 0.01% by weight -- a depth-type cartridge filter is used to trap the
contaminants. At higher concentrations, the filtration mechanism of bulk
solids removal by cake filtration, may operate. At these higher loadings,
the solids can form a cake on the surface of the filter medium. Use of
backwashable fixed-pore depth media, metal filters, or a finer-rated,
fixed-pore medium with a large pleated surface area, may be appropriate.
   While there is no sharp dividing line for choosing any one type of
disposable filter over another, there are several variables that should be
considered in the selection of the optimum filter for a given application:
  -- Nature of the fluid. Compatibility, viscosity, hazard class, value
  -- Process conditions. Flow rate, density, temperature, pressure drop,
batch or continuous process
  -- Type of solid contaminants. Shape, quantity, structure and size, to
determine the degree of filtration required

   Any combination of these factors can determine the final selection of
filter configuration. The purchase price for cartridge filters, along with
the frequency of filter changeout and effluent quality, must be weighed
against the labor, disposal and downtime costs. Once the benchmark criteria
are established, the benefits should exceed the investment cost of the
filter and its use.

Nature of the fluid
As a rule of thumb, any filter component, including the medium, hardware,
housing, O-rings and gaskets, that come in contact with a chemical being
filtered should be compatible with that fluid at operating conditions. A
soak test can verify compatibility once the fluids class -- acid, alkali,
aqueous, oil or solvent -- and percent composition are identified. There is
a broad array of filter materials to consider, among them cellulose, fiber
glass, polypropylene, nylon, cellulose esters, fluorinated polymers and
aramides.
   Viscosity, the resistance of a fluid to the motion of its molecules, is
a measure of the ability of a fluid to flow. The lower the viscosity, the
faster the fluid will flow at a given driving force. (Water has a viscosity
of one cP at 20C.) Because viscosity directly affects the pressure drop
across a set of filters, pleated cartridges and bag filters, with their
larger surface areas to reduce resistance to fluid flow, should be
considered for fluids with a viscosity typically greater than 50 cP.
   Under extreme pressure differentials, there is a potential risk of
collapse for some triangular-pleat constructions. If compatible, use of the
crescent-shaped pleated-style cartridge is also recommended and may be
preferable for some of these applications. The effect of fluid flow is even
more pronounced for applications that require filters rated 20-m absolute
and finer.
   If a spent cartridge contains hazardous waste, then a pleated cartridge,
a configuration that can pack more filter area into a given volume than
that of either a bag or depth filter, may be the optimum choice. The filter
life is longer, and there are fewer filters to remove from the housing and
discard.
   Bag filters, which consist of a porous medium shaped in a bag- or
sock-like structure, are a second choice. Some standard sizes are 4 in.
dia., with lengths of 9 and 15 in., and 7 in. dia., with lengths of 17 and
33 in.
   Although more bags are required to match the service life of pleated
elements, bags may be tightly compacted for disposal.
   If the process fluid is considered expensive, pleated cartridges, may be
the best choice. Pleated elements retain less fluid than do either bag
filters or depth cartridges.

Process conditions
Pleated cartridges are often the optimum choice when long service life is
required. At fine ratings, flow resistance is lower than that of either a
bag or depth filter due to increased surface area. Consequently a smaller,
less expensive housing will suffice for a pleated configuration. For
flow-rates of 250 gal/min or greater, in applications requiring 20-m
absolute or finer filtration, a pleated cartridge may be the best choice.
   It is important to monitor the temperature of a process. Some disposable
media or hardware cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high temperatures.
For high-temperature service above 250F, filters made of metal or ceramic
may be preferred.
   The life of a disposable filter is determined by the service conditions
and actual filter construction. Filter life may relate to its dirt
capacity. A large void volume, or open area of a medium, increases the life
of a filter and affords a lower, clean pressure drop. The life of most
filters is greatly increased as flow density is decreased [2]. The
relationship comparing service life (t = filter life in minutes, hours or
days) to flow density [J = flow density in gal/(min)(ft2)] is given by the
following:
  -- t2 = t1 (J1/J2)n where n = extension factor (dimensionless), 1 and 2
refer to the trials.
   The life extension factor (n) is experimentally determined and has a
value such that: 1 n 2 (Figure 1). Filter life of a chosen configuration
of filters is increased substantially by reducing the flow density to the
elements. The life extension factor will approach two if:
  1. Filter cake is not compressible
  2. Collected cake does not filter finer than the filter
  3. Solids collected are of a uniform diameter

   Therefore, it is generally more economical to install more filters for a
given flow rate. However, it is advisable to perform a cost-benefit
analysis. As stated previously, filtration benefits must equal or exceed
the investment and operating costs of the filter before a selection is
made.
   Total pressure drop, developed across the filter housing, is comprised
of resistance to flow through the piping, the filter's hardware and the
filter medium. The finer the filter rating, the smaller the diameter of the
medium's pores for nondepth-type filters, and the greater the resistance to
the fluid flow, resulting in higher differential pressure. In the selection
of a disposable filter assembly, there must be sufficient pressure to
overcome the initial resistance to flow and to maintain flow as the filter
medium plugs.
   Filter life is enhanced by properly sizing the cartridge to achieve a
low initial clean differential pressure (typically sized at <5 psid). Once
the knee of the characteristic curve of pressure drop versus time for
constant flow is reached, the differential pressure across the filter rises
rapidly (Figure 2). Disposable cartridges and bag filters can generally
withstand 60-80 psid in the forward direction before they begin to fail
structurally. For higher differential pressures, metal filters are the
construction of choice.
   For continuous filtration applications, where long service life is
desired, pleated cartridges are often the optimum choice. Their high
surface areas provide longer service life. For batch filtration operations,
or when filters are changed out after use to avoid cross contamination, a
depth filter may be the optimum choice to fully utilize the life of the
filter before changeout. Furthermore, when filters are changed out
batch-to-batch, the lower-cost depth filter may be the optimum choice.

Types of solid contaminants
To define the effective size of the
contaminant and to determine the de-gree of filtration required, the filter
removal efficiency is a convenient tool. Filters for the chemical process
industries are typically rated by the ``challenge'' system, wherein a
filter is challenged by pumping through it a suspension of a readily
recognized contaminant, such as glass beads, or siliceous or bacterial
suspensions.
   To determine the maximum particle size and assign a removal rating to
the filter, the filtrate is examined for the presence or absence of the
test contaminant downstream. The absolute rating is defined as the removal
of contaminants greater than the size specified. String-wound depth filters
are typically unable to achieve an absolute rating because they do not have
a fixed-pore construction.
   Along with the maximum particle size test, the gravimetric efficiency
test is derived from military specifications. The weight of feed
contaminant to effluent contaminant is determined, and the filter
efficiency rating is assigned.
   The Beta Ratio is the most informative and useful method to express a
filter's removal efficiency and performance over its service life. The test
protocol is an adaption of Oklahoma State University's F-2 filter
performance test [3], modified for the rapid semiautomatic testing of
filters with aqueous fluids in a single pass mode [4]. Using continuous
online particle counters set at several particle sizes, both upstream and
downstream of the test filter, the counts are recorded throughout the life
of the filter (Figure 3). The Beta Ratio, at a specific particle size (x)
is defined as:

(This formular is not available elctronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

   Whereas Bx = 1 represents 0% efficiency at size x, Bx = 2 represents 50%
efficiency at size x, and Bx = 10 represents 90% efficiency, Bx = 5,000
represents 99.8% efficiency at size x, and is typically called the absolute
rating. By tabulating the Beta Ratio values of different filters, the
configuration of a filter can be selected that meets the requirements of a
given application (Figure 4).
   If the process contaminants are gelatinous, a depth-style filter may be
the optimum choice, as gels are trapped in the filter medium where they
could possibly deform and extrude through a pleated or bag filter that is
thinner. If the contaminants form a porous cake, or if the solids loading
is on the high side, a bag filter may be the best choice for the
application.

Cost considerations
The selection of a filter for a specific application depends on the nature
of the fluid, the process conditions, and the type of contaminants. Because
any combination of these factors can determine the final selection,
knowledge of these factors and a careful review of specifications with
filter vendors are essential to making the right choice. When per-element
cost is the primary issue, the depth filter is the first choice.
   Low initial cost must balance frequency of filter changeout -- without
its labor, disposal and downtime cost -- to get a total cost of ownership
value (Table 2). But ultimately, the selected filter must meet all
criteria, as specified by the customer, and provide an economically viable
solution to the filtration application.

WELD OVERLAY RESISTS CORROSION AND EROSION

This pulse-arc welding process produces deposits with only 5-8% dilution,
resulting in better weld chemistry and improved corrosion resistance. By
oscillating the weld torch in the direction of the weld pass, the process
is highly effective at burning out surface contamination and pinholes, so
less weld repairs are necessary. The oscillation also produces a tempering
effect that reduces weld hardness, so hot cracks or micro- fissuring is
less likely.--Geo. P. Reintjes Co., Kan- sas City, Mo.

Fabricated with fiber-reinforced epoxy vinyl ester resin, this duct is used
to collect air contaminated with sulfuric acid mist. Unlike metal or
concrete ducts, these reinforced plastic ducts require no painting or
maintenance. When mounted outdoors, the duct is strong enough to handle the
snow loads of a Canadian winter while resisting acid attack. To improve the
resin's ignition-inhibiting properties, antimony trioxide is added to the
structural layers.--Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich.

WHY PATENT MY INVENTION?
Know how to protect your intellectual property

By:
John Wilson Jones, Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon
Edited by Irene Kim


As an engineer, you're accustomed to keeping your research efforts secret
and following strict company protocols. Unfortunately, these efforts can't
guarantee that you'll reap all the benefits of your work. Often, you may
need to take another step to protect your invention -- applying for a
patent.
   If you think your invention is patentable, act quickly to get necessary
legal processes started right away. In the meantime, don't discuss or share
your work with anyone outside your company.
   This article covers U.S. patents. For information on non-U.S. patents,
try multinational organizations, such as the European Patent Office (box,
p. 118). Whatever intellectual-property protection you're considering,
always check with a patent attorney.

Prepare the groundwork
First, you'll need to determine if your work can be patented. Talk to a
patent attorney to discuss the possibilities.
   People often want to skip the essential step of conducting a patent
search. Anxious to have his or her work protected, an engineer might say,
``File the application now; we'll worry about patentability later.''
Although this approach succeeds on rare occasions, it's often dangerous to
skip the search. You might file an application that infringes on someone
else's patent.
   A crucial step in the patenting process is the search. Don't make the
mistake of thinking that your invention can be patented if it hasn't yet
appeared in a journal or in the marketplace. Browsing through chemical
abstracts or the shelves of local variety stores does not constitute a
patentability search. You'll need to thoroughly comb U.S. and foreign
patents.
   Although many engineers know they'll need a lawyer later on to draft a
patent application, few understand how important it is to use an attorney
for their search. The costs of determining patentability are a fraction of
those you'd spend on drafting and filing a patent application.
   For instance, if you chose to conduct a search on your own, you might
not conduct it thoroughly. And you might find that someone's already
patented the invention you thought was original -- only after you've hired
an attorney at considerable expense to file your patent application.
   The more you know about existing patents, the better you're equipped to
protect your invention. A well-conducted search enables you to accurately
judge how you should define the claims of your patent. The way you present
your application determines the scope of protection your work will
receive.
   For example, if your process can be slightly modified to work in a
number of different industries, your search may reveal that none of these
variants have been patented -- and so you can claim all of them in your
application. But if you describe only the basic process in the application,
other people may later be able to patent the variants. (For more-detailed
information about what to claim in a patent, see CE, September 1993, p.
120.)
   If your search determines that your invention is indeed patentable, you
must decide whether to apply for a patent or keep your work a trade secret
(box, p. 118). Basically, a patent gives you the exclusive right to
practice your invention for no more than 20 years from the date you file
the patent application; by contrast, trade-secret status means that you
may be able to keep your invention out of the public domain indefinitely.

No matter what, mum's the word
If you decide to apply for a patent, don't talk about or disclose your
invention to anyone outside your organization until after the application
is filed in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO; Washington, D.C.).
Inadvertent disclosure of your work to a third party can ruin your
company's foreign and U.S. marketing plans for the invention.
   In most non-U.S. countries, you lose your right to patent if you
disclose your invention before filing. In the U.S., however, you can file
for up to one year after the date of first disclosure. However, it's
advisable not to disclose your invention under most circumstances.
   For example, if you talk to someone about your invention before filing,
that person might try to patent your invention. This frequently happens
when an inventor collaborates with someone (a ``third party'') on part of
the research. The third party then files a separate application, thinking
that he or she, not the named inventor, is the actual inventor of the
idea.
   In such a case, what generally happens is that the USPTO declares a
conflict, or ``interference,'' between the applicants. No matter what the
final outcome, one result is inevitable: sky-high legal fees for the named
inventor.

Document your efforts
You can lose your right to a patent if you haven't maintained appropriate
records of your work. While the patent application is pending, you may
need to produce records that document two dates:
  -- Conception date. This is the point at which a coworker could take over
the invention, continuing to work on it without making an additional
invention
  -- Reduction-to-practice date. The invention was actually completed by
this date, and must have been shown to accomplish its intended purpose
   The documentation chronicling these dates can also be vital in later
litigation. For example, you'll need these records in case of later
interference.

PATENT OR TRADE SECRET?

Trade-secret status is inferred to an invention when it is not disclosed to
a third party. A U.S. patent, on the other hand, allows you to prevent
others from practicing (using, making or selling) your invention. Until
June 1994, the patent term was 17 years from the date the patent was
granted; now it is 20 years from the application-filing date.
   In order to obtain a patent, you must fully disclose your work. Not only
must you clearly explain all embodiments of the invention (e.g., variants)
-- you must also set forth the best mode of operating the invention. You
cannot receive a patent on an idea while simultaneously shielding important
aspects of the invention. You cannot, for instance, obtain a patent on a
new detergent without disclosing the preferred ratios of components of the
detergent and how it is made.
   In typical circumstances, your company will most want to patent those
aspects of your invention that can be most easily analyzed, or ``back
engineered.'' For instance, if your detergent is easily analyzed, you'll
probably want to patent the composition.
   At the same time, you want to patent those aspects of your invention
that you consider the most important. For example, if the crux of your work
is a new process for preparing detergent (rather than the composition), you
may choose to patent the process, and not the composition.
   Another factor to consider, when you're deciding whether or not to
patent, is the likelihood that a competitor could independently invent the
same thing. If you invent a process that you decide to make a trade secret
(rather than patenting), and your competitor Company X comes up with the
same process, Company X may file for and receive a patent. In this case,
you'd be barred from using your own invention for the 20-year life of
Company X's patent.
   Whether you decide to make the invention a trade secret or to patent it,
do not disclose it to anyone outside the company. If your company decides
to keep the invention a company secret, employees should not disclose the
invention to anyone outside the corporation. Documents disclosing or
discussing the invention should be clearly marked ``Confidential.'' Such
documents should be circulated within the company on a need-to-know basis
only. When you dispose of these documents, shred them -- don't just toss
them in a wastebasket.

A SHORTCUT FOR DESIGNING EVAPORATORS
A simple and fast method for finding the optimum number of effects

By:
M.I. Alejandro Anaya Durand, Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo
Edited by Jayadev Chowdhury


Multiple-effect evaporation is commonly used in chemical process plants to
minimize energy consumption and cooling water. In this system, several
evaporators are connected by piping so that vapor passes from one effect to
the next in series. Thus, the heat supplied to the first evaporator is used
to vaporize water in the first effect; this vapor, in turn, passes to the
next effect, until, finally, the heat in the vapor supplied to the last
effect passes on to the condenser.
   The net result of this arrangement is the multiple reuse of heat, and a
marked increase in the economy of the evaporation system. This economy in
evaporation is defined as the ratio of the overall water evaporated to the
amount of steam provided to the first effect. An increase in the number of
effects represents an increase in evaporation economy. A rough
approximation of the economy is obtained by multipliying the number of
effects by 0.8.
   In addition to savings in steam use, there is also a saving in condenser
cooling water as the number of effects increases. This is because the
equipment has to handle only the evaporation of the last effect.
   On the other hand, an increase in the number of effects represents an
increase in capital costs since more heat transfer area is required in the
evaporator system. Thus, the choice of the proper - that is, optimum -
number of effects is dictated by an economic balance between the savings in
steam and cooling water versus that of the additional investment costs.

The basic equations
The procedure is based on the simplified method developed by J. Coates and
B. Presburg to analyze and calculate the performance of multiple-effect
evaporation [1]. Here, the series resistance concept is considered, as
follows:
(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)
   The way to evaluate the terms of the above equation is suggested by
Coates. The key equations are:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)
where, lav is the ``average'' latent heat of the vapors through the
evaporator, and tLi is the temperature of the liquor in the effect the feed
enters regardless of whether it is in the first effect or not. The factor b
equals (1 + 0.1n) for the forward-feed case, and may be taken as 1.0 for
all other cases.
   An ``effective'' overall heat-transfer coefficient of the evaporator can
be calculated by employing the series-resistance concept.
   U subscript E = 1 / (1/U subscript 1 + 1/U subscript 2 + ...+ 1 / U
subscript n) (4)

The overall temperature difference in the evaporators can be evaluated by
the equation:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

where, ts is the temperature of the steam to the evaporator and tn is the
boiling point of the liquor in the last effect. The boiling-point-elevation
effect is not considered in this equation.
   The temperature differences in each effect can be estimated by
considering similar heat loads in each effect

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Also, to minimize fabrication costs, it is normal to design the evaporators
so that each effect is equal in area; then:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Equations (5) and (7) can be employed to determine the temperature
differences in each effect, with assumed values for the overall
heat-transfer coefficients.
   The overall heat-transfer equation through the multiple-effect
evaporator can be expressed by the equation

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Steam consumption is estimated from the heat transferred in the first
effect

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Therefore, the steam consumption is:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

The amount of vapor from the last effect to the condenser may be calculated
by employing the simplifying assumption that the evaporations from each
effect are equal:
(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (11)

  The cooling water required for the condenser is obtained from the heat
balance of the system, by considering the vapor from the last effect.
   W = En[ln + Cw (tn twi)] / (two-twi) (12)
Solving Equation 8 for SA, and combining it with Equations 2, 3, 4 and 5
gives:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (13)
   To solve this equation, assumed values for heat transfer coefficients
for each effect must be given.
   If the feed is available at relatively low temperatures, then backward
evaporator operation - in which feed enters the last effect - is often
used. In this system, tLi equals the boiling point of the fluid in the last
effect, and depends on the pressure in the condenser. The numerator of
Equation 13 and the terms (ts - tn) are independent of the number of
effects of the evaporator considered, and can be evaluated for the design
conditions. Thus, the overall area required, SA, can be calculated quickly
and easily with such equation, by evaluating the term for the heat-transfer
coefficients (in the brackets in the denominator) for the different number
of effects considered.
   Similarly, Equations 9 and 10 can be rearranged to determine the steam
consumption:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (14)

Also, for backward operation, only the last term of the of the above
equation is affected by the number of effects, and so the other terms are
evaluated for the design conditions of the evaporator. Thus, steam
consumption can be calculated for the number of effects considered.

Economic analysis
The total annual costs, CT, of the multiple-effect evaporator are the sum
of the capital fixed costs plus the operating costs.
   C subscript T = C subscript F + C subscript O (15)

   An increase in the number of evaporator effects represents an increase
in the fixed costs and a decrease in operating costs. CI is the minimum
total costs for an ``optimum'' number of effects.
   The fixed costs may be evaluated by the following equation:
(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (16)

Epsilon Alpha is the overall area of evaporation, ft superscript 2
C subscript ao is the cost of evaporation, $/ft superscript 2
K subscript f is the annual fixed charges, expressed as a fraction of
initial cost, for installed unit, dimensionless
C subscript F is the fixed costs, $/yr

The operating costs mainly consist of the steam costs together with the
cooling water costs:
C subscript O = W subscript U H subscript Y C subscript U (17)

W subscript U is the flowrate of the utility, lb/h
H subscript Y is the hours of operation per year
C subscript U is the cost of utility, $/lb
C subscript O is the operating costs, $/yr

   With the calculated values of evaporator area (A in Equation 13), steam
consumption (S in Equation 14), and of cooling-water requirements (Wc in
Equation 12), the total annual costs can be solved (CT in Equation 15).
   The above procedure can be quickly carried out for other numbers of
effects in the evaporator. For instance, if an increase in the number of
effects leads to a reduction in the total costs (CT), it may represent an
economically attractive increase in the number of effects. Naturally, the
number of effects that gives the minimum total costs represents the optimum
one.

An example
A solution with a neglible boiling-point elevation is to be concentrated
from 10 to 50% solids in a multiple-effect evaporator. Steam is available
at a pressure of 15 psig and at 249 degrees F. The absolute pressure in the
last effect is 4 in. Hg (the boiling point is 125 degrees F).
   The feed enters at 70 degrees F to the last effect (backward feed), at a
rate of 55,000 lb/h. The specific heat of the solutions may be taken as 1.0
Btu/(lb)(degrees F) at all concentrations.
   First, we need to estimate the heat-transfer area needed for a
triple-effect evaporator. The estimated heat-transfer coefficients are 450
in the first effect, 350 in the second, and 250 in the third.
   Secondly, we need to find out if a quadruple-effect may be economically
attractive. The estimated heat-transfer coefficients are 450 in the flrst
effect, 350 in the second, 300 in the third and 250 in the fourth.

Economic data
The evaporator cost (installed) may be estimated by the following empirical
equation: C subscript ao, $/ft superscript 2 = 11.24 (A) + 7,314
Annual fixed charges, K subscript f = 10% of the initial costs
Hours of operation per year, H subscript y = 8,000
Cooling water (available at 70 degrees F) costs, C subscript U = $0.1/1,000
gal
Steam costs, CU = $2.7/1,000 lb

Triple-effect evaporator
Evaporation rate, (This equation is not available electronically. Please
see January 1996, issue.)

The ``effective'' overall heat-transfer coefficient (Equation 4), U
subscript E = 1 / [(1 / 450) + (1 / 350) + (1 / 250)]= 110.14 Btu/h (ft2) 
degrees F

Operating conditions at the third effect, T subscript Li = 125 degrees F
(boiling point)

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)(vapor's latent heat) For backward feed, b = 1

The overall evaporator area, (This equation is not available
electronically. Please see January 1996, issue.)

Steam consumption (steam at 249 degrees F, 945 Btu/lb latent heat), S =
[55,000 (1)
(125 - 70) + {44,000 (1,022 - [1,022 (2/3)]}] / 945 = 19,380 lb/h

The economy of the triple-effect evaporator = 44,000 / 19,380 = 2.27
The estimated amount of vapor to the condenser = 44,000 / 3 = 14,667 lb/h
   If the temperature difference between the vapor and the outlet cooling
water in the condenser is around 5 degrees F, then the cooling-water
requirements at the condenser are:
W subscript c = 14,667 [1,022 + (1) (122 - 117)] / (117 - 70) = 320, 489
lb/h

Quadruple-effect evaporator
The ``effective'' heat transfer coefficient,
U subscript E = 1 / [(1 / 450) + (1 / 350) + (1 / 300) + (1 / 250)] =
80.56

The overall evaporation area, (This equation is not available
electronically. Please see January 1996, issue.)

The steam consumption, S = [55,000 (1) (125 - 70) + 44,000 {1,022 - [1,022
(3/4)]}] / 945 = 15,097 lb/h
The economy of the quadruple-effect evaporator = 44,000 / 15,097 = 2.91
The estimated amount of vapor to the condenser = 44,000 / 4 = 11,000 lb/h
Finally, the cooling water requirements at the condenser, W subscript c =
11,000 [1,022+ 1 (122 - 117)] / (117 - 70) = 240,362 lb/h

The payback time
The costs for the for the triple-effect versus the quadruple-effect
evaporator are given in the Table on p. 124. By comparing the numbers, one
can see that the total annual costs for a quadruple effect system are lower
than for a unit with three effects. This makes it economically attractive
to increase the number of effects.
   The difference in investment = 61,311 - 46,811 = $14,500
   The difference in costs = 452,713 - 355,314 = $97,399/yr
   The payback period = 14,500 / 97,399 = 0.14 years.
   This confirms that it economically advantageous to install a quadruple
effect in the evaporator.

SHARING REAL-TIME PLANT INFORMATION
Engineers, analysts and managers make better business and technology
decisions with access to timely process data

By:
Edited by Suzanne Shelley

At any petroleum refinery, developing process improvements and solving
production problems requires access to accurate and timely operating
information, including tank field data, laboratory results and furnace
efficiency. By installing a state-of-the-art data acquisition and
presentation system, the Chevron Refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., now makes
real-time process data widely available to managers and engineers
throughout the facility.
   Historically, Chevron engineers responsible for process improvements and
troubleshooting would go to a control room and gather reams of paper from
stripchart recorders and data loggers. They would study the tracings and
numbers on these paper strips and enter the data into calculators and
computer programs for detailed analysis. Not only was data gathering labor
intensive, but the refinery operated a number of private computer systems,
which meant that engineers and managers only had access to information that
was generated within their own divisions.
   With the advent of a microprocessor-based distributed control system
(DCS) at the Pascagoula facility, an automated, paperless data acquisition
system became possible. To gather all its real-time operating and
process-monitoring data using one centralized system, Chevron first
replaced all its discrete process monitoring systems with InfoPlus from
Setpoint, Inc. (Houston, Tex.). At the same time, the firm selected Setcim,
another product from Setpoint, to automate information management at its
tank field and laboratories. InfoPlus and Setcim are fully compatible with
one another and are easily networked together using the same graphic
console system.

Power at your fingertips
This new, integrated information monitoring and management system provides
operators with a clearer picture of refinery operations. For example, one
can create a single graph that shows the current operating efficiency,
excess oxygen, and target values for all furnaces in the refinery. This
allows problems to be identified and corrected well before they incur
shutdown or significant repair costs.
   Equipment engineers have successfully used the networked system to
identify and correct untimely equipment failures and recurring mechanical
problems. Researchers at remote locations also have ready access to
operating data, allowing them to target their process-improvement studies
to actual refinery conditions.
   Another important application provides an interface between the
laboratory information-management system and the plant information system.
   This makes it easy to combine lab and process data, and display them
graphically, to make correlations.
   Tank field management has also improved. Setcim's real-time database 
calculates the volume in each tank and tracks materials moving from ships
to tanks, transfers between tanks, and discharges from tanks to process
units. All this material-transfer information is also uploaded to the
accounting system, which makes inventory management more timely and
accurate. And, while the system provides immediate access to process and
inventory data from virtually any location in the refinery or corporation
-- it requires only three people to support it.

A networked hierarchy
The compatible Setcim and InfoPlus systems are a hierarchy of networked
systems. The bottom layer manages short-term, local operating data from six
individual process units, and maintains 24-h data averages for a period of
one year. This layer is designed to help operators and production
supervisors manage and control the day-to-day refinery operations.
   The top, or public, layer of the information management system gathers
information from the process unit system and makes it available to
selected consoles and individuals throughout the refinery, as well as to
corporate offices worldwide. This top layer updates more than 30,000 data
points once every minute. The graphics system is a client-server system.
With graphics tasks handled on the client workstation, network traffic and
server loading are minimized, substantially improving response time.

BRINGING AUTOMATION TO VISCOSITY MEASUREMENT
By combining a differential viscometer with robotic sample preparation, one
polymer lab increased throughput by 300%

By:
Edited by Suzanne Shelley


During polymer production, inherent viscosity (IV) is an important quality
and process control parameter. Determined by measuring the viscosity of a
dilute solution of the polymer in a solvent, IV reflects the molecular
weight of the polymer, and the material's ability to be processed for
different applications.
  At Tennessee Eastman's Polymer Division in Kingsport, Tenn., IV is
measured at least every 2-4 hours on samples taken from each polymer
production line, and from every shipment. When increased production began
to tax the laboratory's capacity, the company elected to automate its
viscosity measurement system.
  Since investing in several differential viscometers from Viscotek Corp.
(Houston, Tex.) for more rapid viscosity measurement, and a robotic system
from Zymark Corp. (Hopkinton, Mass). to weigh, dilute and load samples,
Tennessee Eastman has more than doubled its analysis capacity -- and has
simultaneously reduced the amount of laboratory labor required.
  Until 1986, the lab measured viscosity using a glass capillary
viscometer. A technician manually weighed and diluted a polymer sample and
placed the solution in the capillary tube. Photoelectric detectors measured
the time required for the polymer solution to flow by gravity between two
marks on the tube. The technician then calculated IV based on the flow time
through the viscometer.
  After analysis, the capillary was manually rinsed with solvent and
refilled. Using two full-time technicians, the lab was able to measure
60-90 samples during a typical 12-h shift.

Growing lab demands
As production capacity at the Tennessee Eastman facility grew, so did its
analytical requirements. Instead of adding technicians, equipment and lab
space, the firm replaced the 12 capillary viscometers with two Model 100
differential viscometers from Viscotek. Operating 24 h/d, 365 d/yr, each
differential viscometer processes a sample five times as fast as one of
the capillary tubes previously used.
  The differential viscometers operate on the same principle as a
Wheatstone bridge: Polymer solution flows through one side of the bridge,
while pure solvent flows through the other. Pressure transducers measure
the differential pressure and inlet pressure across the bridge. The
transducer output is then transmitted to a personal computer, which
calculates IV based on the pressure data and the polymer concentration in
the solvent.
  Tennessee Eastman also installed robots to prepare samples for the
differential viscometers. Now, a robot picks up the sample, weighs it,
places it in a clean dissolution tube, adds enough solvent to make the
required for a 0.5 vol.% polymer solution, and then transfers the tube to a
heating block to dissolve the polymer. The robot then puts the tube on a
cooling rack before extracting a sample to fill a sample injection loop for
the differential viscometer.
  With this level of automation, the lab now measures the IV of 325-425
samples per shift, and has the capacity to handle up to 450 samples per
shift. This increase has been accomplished with a staff reduction of half a
person.
  The technicians now operating the lab focus on supporting the viscometers
and robots. They load samples, clean glassware, proof analytical results
before the computer sends them to production, and perform weekly preventive
maintenance cleaning.
  They may also operate a manual differential viscometer when the automatic
systems are down for routine maintenance, or during the analysis of
polymers that contain fillers that could plug the capillaries in the
bridge.
  In the seven years since the Tennessee Eastman's Polymer Division 
switched to automated viscometers and robotics, the units have required
minimal maintenance and downtime. And, since the facility stocks its own
spare lab parts, it can correct most problems within minutes.

hazardous solvents

LEACH POTASH FROM MINERALS USING COLD CRYSTALLIZATION
Operating at ambient temperatures, this system yields 98% pure potash 
without steam or cooling water

By:
Edited by Suzanne Shelley

The mineral carnallite (KClMgCl2 6H20), a naturally occurring evaporite
deposit found in ancient seas, is a major source of potash (KCl) for the
world fertilizer market. The potash is typically separated from carnallite
by crystallization, using an energy-intensive, hot leach process.
   Using the conventional approach, the carnallite is dissolved in a hot
aqueous solution, which is saturated with respect to NaCl but unsaturated
with respect to MgCl2 and KCl. As additional carnallite is added, the
solution becomes saturated with KCl. As the hot, saturated solution is
cooled, KCl crystals precipitate. While effective, the conventional process
requires large amounts of steam, water, and electrical energy for heating,
cooling and pumping.
   In 1994, after a three-year pilot program, the Arab Potash Co. (Safi,
Jordan) began to use a full-scale, cold crystallization system provided by
Swenson Process Equipment, Inc. (Harvey, Ill.) at its 400,000-m.t./yr
potash plant. Designed to decompose carnallite from the Dead Sea, the
system consists of only two 55-ft dia. crystallizers, which operate at
ambient temperature.
   Since startup in late 1994, the plant has been producing high-purity
potash at or above design capacity, with no steam consumption. By
comparison, the hot-leach process requires 266,000 kcal of steam heat per
m.t. potash. Similarly, the cold process requires no cooling water, while
the hot process requires 6.5 m3 of cooling water per m.t. of potash. And,
using just 11 kWh electricity per m.t. of potash, the cold process has half
the power requirements of the conventional hot-leach process.

Harvesting the ocean's bounty
The evaporite carnallite is composed of a 1:1 molar ratio of KCl and MgCl,
with six water molecules. It is almost always contaminated with other
salts, particularly sodium chloride. To produce pure potash from
carnallite, the evaporite mineral is decomposed with water, so that the
pure potash can be crystallized, and a brine containing MgCl2, NaCl and
other salts can be rejected.
   In the Swenson cold process, carnallite solids are brought by conveyor
to the top of a crystallizer and dispersed into a circulating slurry of
crystals and mother liquor. As the carnallite crystals enter the slurry,
they are surrounded by growing crystals of KCl, which act as a sponge,
absorbing the supersaturated KCl that is created by the ongoing
decomposition of the carnallite.
   In the Swenson draft-tube-baffle crystallizer, a large, slow-moving
propeller enclosed by a draft tube directs the circulation of crystals and
near-saturated MgCl2 mother liquor to the surface within the vessel. The
baffle surrounding the draft tube defines the crystallizing volume.
   Surrounding the baffle is a large settling zone, where the mother liquor
that contains only the finer fractions of the crystalline material is
removed. This mother liquor is mixed with water to ensure complete
dissolution of any residual fine crystals. This maintains the required
material balance, ensuring optimal decomposition of the carnallite feed.
From a separate zone in the settling area, another stream of mother liquor
-- this one containing MgCl2 -- is removed to maintain the overall material
balance in the system.
   Strong demand for fertilizers and other mineral-derived products,
combined with the growing cost of energy worldwide, encourages the use of
low-energy technologies. Since late 1994, the cold crystallization system
at Arab Potash has been making 98%-pure KCl at or above the system's
400,000-m.t./yr design capacity. Similar cold crystallization systems are
being used elsewhere to cost-effectively produce purified crystals from
mineral products.

process

CLEAR AWAY THE PAPER BLIZZARD
Electronic Document Management (EDM) simplifies recordkeeping

By:
NICHOLAS BASTA

Question: When is a computer file not a file? Answer: When it is a
``document'' in a document-management system.
   That paradoxical statement doesn't refer so much to the format or data
structure of a computer file, but rather to what purpose it is being put.
When originally created, a text file, CAD drawing or maintenance workers'
job ticket is usually printed on paper, carried about by involved workers,
then ultimately stored in a file cabinet. Days, months or years later,
there may be a pressing need to look at the stored information, but very
often it is misplaced, forgotten or, because of the language and format in
which the electronic version was created, unreadable by current equipment.
   Enter a solution, variously called electronic, engineering, technical or
product document management. The goal of electronic document management
(EDM) is to capture all written information (and, in the more advanced
systems, graphics and video information as well) in a form that can be
stored safely and retrieved with minimum effort. Thus, the answer to the
trick question above is that, once stored in an ordered, retrievable
manner, a computer file has been transformed into an electronic
``document.''
   Usually, the data are stored in an electronic ``vault,'' a computer
system with copious amounts of disk space, and a database management system
(DBMS) that records the information type and location. The scope of the EDM
system can range from a small electronic file manager that tracks all
versions of some project, to comprehensive, enterprise-wide systems. These
large systems have optical character-recognition programs to translate
paper text into computer files, along with indexing functions to
automatically store the files by topic.
   Throughout business and manufacturing, EDM systems are being applied not
only to keep the institutional memory in place, but also as a technique to
speed up design of new products and meet competitive pressures. (Thus, the
one flavor of EDM called product document management -- PDM -- for the
creation of, say, a new automobile.)

A trio of objectives
In the context of the CPI, the three most important goals that EDM systems
address are ISO 9000 certification, safety-recordkeeping requirements of
the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and, for
pharmaceutical manufacturers, the validation procedures of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
   Properly applied, the same EDM system can provide compliance with all
three goals. However, it is not unheard of for a company to have one system
installed for FDA requirements, and another for OSHA.
   EDM is caught up today in the whirlwind of advances occurring in both
hardware and software. On the hardware side, companies are investing in the
latest generations of optical storage technology, which swallows gigabytes
of data at a mouthful, and advanced networking tools, such as wide-area
telecommunications and networking, including Internet servers. On the
software side, EDM partakes of the shift toward object-oriented programming
(OOP) that characterizes the latest database and CAD programs.
   In fact, there is a blurring together of the CAD software business with
that of EDM. CAD vendors consider themselves the front end of the EDM
business, in that preliminary and detailed design drawings are usually
created by CAD packages. If there is software available to combine reports,
notes and letters with the drawings, the basic elements of an EDM system
are in place.
   One company that positioned itself as much as a data manager as a CAD
supplier is EA Systems (Alameda, Calif.), which markets the Pasce (Plant
Applications for Concurrent Engineering) program. The system is notable for
using the same database structure for 2D as for 3D design files.
   Over the past couple years, it has forged links with most of the other
major CAD vendors, so that users of those programs can still take advantage
of the data-storage capabilities of Pasce. Interfaces have also been
successfully written for a number of commercial EDM programs, says Marie
Telepneff, marketing manager for EA.
   Those big CAD companies, though, are coming out with EDM systems as
extensions of their CAD franchise. Intergraph Corp. (Huntsville, Ala.)
introduced a small-scaled program that ran under Microsoft Windows,
DM/Librarian, in 1994, then followed in 1995 with a full-blown system
called DM2.
   DM2 has nine modules, including ones called Manager, Server and
Workflow. These three, which build on each other, allow the user to set up
the basic DBMS (including a client-server architecture that runs on many
different Unix and Windows platforms) and manage how data are entered and
retrieved. DM/Workflow helps managers set up and monitor the progress of a
project through its phases.
   EDM gives the CPI better access to design information needed over the
life cycle of a plant. ``Plant owners work with a design-construction
company for five years to build a facility, but then run that facility for
decades,'' notes Tommy Steele, president of Intergraph Software Solutions,
one of the company's divisions. ``They want to be able to use all the
documents that were created during the life of the facility.''
   Bentley Systems, Inc. (Exton, Pa.) also announced an EDM product last
year: TeamMate, the rights to which it acquired from Opti Inter-Consult, a
Finnish EDM company. The product works directly with MicroStation,
Bentley's flagship CAD product, and can be customized to handle most types
of computer files.
   Bentley emphasizes the workflow management aspects of TeamMate. The
creation of, access to, and changes within a document can all be tracked by
the program. An audit trail, in which every change in the document is
recorded, is also generated.

In the PC arena
Both Bentley's and Intergraph's products, now available in versions that
can run on PCs, originally were designed for more powerful, Unix-based
workstation computers. One CAD product that has been PC-based from the
start is AutoCad, from AutoDesk, Inc. (Sausalito, Calif.), which works with
a variety of third parties to produce industry-specific packages.
   One of the more prominent of these third parties is Rebis (Walnut
Creek, Calif.), whose AutoPlant programs tailor AutoCad to the needs of the
CPI. Rebis now offers PlantLIFE, a data-management system to track design
files, match them with other documents such as operating procedures, and
provide an audit trail of revisions.
   PlantLIFE doesn't need AutoCAD to view drawings or other documents, so
users not running the CAD package can still work with it. Rebis says that
the program has features that make it especially useful for compliance with
the OSHA 1910 regulation, which requires up-to-date documentation of
process equipment and procedures. OSHA 1910 also has a ``management of
change'' provision that makes a critical issue of revisions to existing
documents or procedures.
   Most recently, Rebis announced that it would develop a version of its
family of products that are compatible with Bentley's MicroStation. The
conversion is made feasible by the plans of both Autodesk and Bentley to
use OOP in their newer generations of products.
   Computervision Inc. (Bedford, Mass.), one of the leading PDM firms, has
developed a comprehensive data-management system that has interfaces to
both its CAD products (Cadds, Medusa and others) and those of most
competitors. Called Optegra, the system has workflow and data-management
components, as well as a ``configuration master,'' which allows users to
assemble drawings, bills of materials and other information into a unified
whole that can be accessed directly.

Moving paper
CAD vendors are by no means the only players in the EDM arena. A large
number of other companies, whose sole reason for existence is EDM, are also
important in the field. These companies generally have not had strong
experience in the process manufacturing arena, but, when paired with other
partners, can provide appropriate technical solutions.
   Documentum, Inc. (Pleasanton, Calif.), for example, has paired up with
Consilium Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.) to market Enterprise Document
Management System (EDMS) for process manufacturers, especially in the
pharmaceutical industry. Consilium, a supplier of manufacturing execution
software, sees the combination of its plant-floor datagathering and EDMS's
document storage as powerful tools for cutting time-to-market delays. FDA
regulations, for example, take an enormous amount of records to validate
not only what processes are used to make drugs, but even what equipment is
used, and how closely test results are matched with production parameters.
   At the New York Chem Show (Dec. 2-4), Foxboro Co. (Foxboro, Mass.)
announced an alliance with Documentum, whereby EDMS is embedded in
Foxboro's I/AS distributed control system. ``The system works at the
operators' level, where they can retrieve safety data sheets, operating
procedures and the like from their workstation,'' says Harry Forbes, a
Foxboro marketing manager.
   Another matchup combines IBM's computer and networking prowess with that
of NovaSoft Systems, Inc. (Burlington, Mass. 630), which markets NovaManage
EDM software. While managing both workflow and documentation functions,
NovaManage has an intuitive interface that allows memory-challenged users
to search for records on the basis of ``looks like'' or ``sounds like''
criteria. Documents are automatically time-stamped when created or stored.
The latest version, 6.2, features a ``cellular document'' approach that
allows departmental managers to customize the enterprise-wide system to
local requirements.
   A newcomer to the EDM field is VirtualPlant, from The Simplex Group,
Inc. (Pittsburgh, Pa.). The program allows users both to produce drawings
of existing plant equipment, using simple layout tools, and to link
documents, procedures and other relevant information to the diagrams. A
library of standard objects is included.
   The U.K. brings its expertise to the EDM field via Cimage Enterprise
Systems (Bracknell, Berkshire, England), which has just released version
1.0 of Document Manager API, a library of application programming
interfaces for various Microsoft products. The system is designed to work
simply as another open window during a Windows session, with users pulling
down menus to make entries. The program can operate as a server in a LAN or
wide-area network (WAN), and can handle scanned documents, CAD drawings and
common Windows business applications. Cimage is represented in the U.S. by
Access Corp. (Cincinnati, Ohio).
   Various studies cite the statistic that engineers spend 40 to 75% of
their time looking for data and documents, thus drastically cutting into
their active work time. EDM systems offer to cut that time considerably, or
at least make the search a less frustrating task.
   Will file cabinets and other storage compartments for records become a
thing of the past? Probably not, but at least the paper blizzard will be
brought under control, leaving engineers more time to meet their
obligations.
