<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Frequently Asked Questions About NYL</STRONG></FONT><P>

<STRONG>How long has New York Life been in business?</STRONG><BR>
New York Life first opened for business in 1845 as Nautilus Insurance Company.  It became New
York Life Insurance Company in 1849.<P>

<STRONG>How large is New York Life?</STRONG><BR>
New York Life is a Fortune 100 company, with over $75 billion in assets and $16 billion in

Bermuda, mainland China, Hong Kong,  Indonesia, Mexico, Taiwan, South Korea, and the United
Kingdom.<P>

<STRONG>What, exactly, is a "mutual insurance company?"</STRONG><BR>
Unlike a stock company, a mutual insurance company, such as New York Life, does not offer
shares of stock on public exchanges.  Rather, it is operated and maintained for the benefit
of its members, or policyowners.  All policyowners have the right to vote for the Company's
Board of Directors and to receive a fair share of the dividends declared by the Board each
year.<P>

<STRONG>Who are some of New York Life's major clients?</STRONG><BR> 
Some of New York Life's more recognizable clients include General Motors,  the National
Basketball Association, the Air Line Pilots Association, and The American Institute of
Architects.  Over the course of our history, we have also insured many United States
Presidents and a host of political, social, business, and military leaders, professional
athletes, and entertainers.<P>

<STRONG>What products and services does New York Life offer?</STRONG><BR>
On the insurance side, New York Life and its affiliates offer traditional life and group
health insurance, annuities, and managed health care.  On the financial side, New York Life
and its affiliates provide institutional investment management, trust services, and 401(k)
services.  One of its subsidiaries, NYLIFE Securities Inc., offers an array of securities
products and services, such as the MainStay funds for both retail and institutional investors.<P>

<STRONG>Does New York Life have an office near me?</STRONG><BR>
New York Life has offices in every state nationwide.  But you don't have to go to a New York
Life office -- an agent can visit you in your home or place of business.  Click on the "Contact NYL" button to find the office nearest you or to send an e-mail.<P>

<STRONG>How can I purchase a product from New York Life?</STRONG><BR>
Insurance products must be purchased through an agent, who will work closely with you to
determine your needs and the best product to fill them.  Mutual funds may be purchased
through your workplace or individually, through a New York Life  registered representative.
<P>

All New York Life agents must complete a rigorous training course, called NYLIC University,

professional educations throughout their careers. In each general office,
agents are recruited by sales managers, who look for initiative, intelligence, and character
in a candidate.<P>

<P>
<STRONG>What are ratings?  Why are they so important?</STRONG><BR>
Independent ratings for insurance companies are based on their financial strength and ability
to pay claims  -- two critical factors in choosing an insurer.  The higher a company is rated,
the stronger and more reliable it is.  Four major companies -- Duff &amp; Phelps, Moody's
Investors Service, Standard &amp; Poor's, and A.M. Best -- have all given New York Life and NYLIAC
(its annuity subsidiary) high ratings.<P>

<STRONG>Term vs. Whole Life - What's the difference, and which one should I buy?
</STRONG><BR>
As with any insurance product, it depends on your needs.  Generally, the difference between
term life insurance and whole life insurance is that whole life is a permanent product that
builds cash value.  Policyowners can make loans against the cash value if needed.  It has a
higher initial premium, which remains level throughout the life of the policy.<P>

Term is a temporary insurance product with a fairly low initial premium, which increases as
you get older.  Beneficiaries will receive insurance proceeds only if death occurs within a
specified period - the "term" of the contract.  A term policy offers protection only and does
not build cash value.<P>

<STRONG>How can I get more information?</STRONG><BR>
