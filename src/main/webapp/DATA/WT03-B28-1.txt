HOW TO MARKET 'GOOD FOR YOU' PRODUCTS TO KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS

      You have a great educationally oriented product, which is
actually quite entertaining - a CD-ROM perhaps, or an electronic
learning aid (ELA) - but the kids seem to be passing it by for the
latest offering from Nintendo.
      Their parents are interested in the product, and want to be sure
that it has bona fide educational value, but the kids just want to
have fun. 
      How do you market two messages - educational and entertaining -
about one product to two audiences?
      Simple, says Cynthia Colmenares, vice president of sales and
marketing at Comfy Inc. Use one medium to carry two distinct messages.
      The company, a creator of an electronic learning aid product
with add-on software that plugs into a PC or Macintosh, needed to
emphasize to parents that its electronic activity center, which
retails for about $99, would definitely help their children on the
road to computer literacy, and to the mastery of many learning skills.
      Yet, kids needed to know that the product would be fun to use.
      Comfy launched a television commercial campaign on Cable News
Network and Nickelodeon in which two streams of information were
simultaneously directed to the parents and the kids.
      The voice-over in the first commercial, called "First Step," is
directed at parents, and talks to parents about watching their kids
take their first steps, utter their first words, and use their first
computer.
      The visuals in the commercial, however, are directed at kids,
which depict children having fun with their families and older
siblings at the computer.
      The visuals in the second commercial depict young and older
children laughing and playing with the product, while the voice-over
once again emphasized to the parent the educational values of the
product.        
      Comfy made sure to broadcast the commercials at times when both
kids and parents would see t. They appeared Saturday morning and
during the early evening half-hour sitcom time frame. Comfy, which
began its TV ad campaign last year, is still running in the New York
market. 
      There are companies who do not try to market to the younger
customer at all, saying that parents are the major purchasers, and
marketing should be directed at them.  Fisher Price, for example, says
it does not market educational toys to the 6 and under set because
they believe the kids are just too young to absorb a marketing
message.
      There are ways to convey to kids that your educational product
is fun, without actually conducting a formal marketing campaign,
however.        
      While no marketing is specifically aimed at kids, company
spokesperson Linda Duttenhauer at Davidson & Associates, Inc., a
company which led the market with educational products such as its
"Blaster" series of math and reading CD-ROMS,  said that there are
ways to communicate a sense of fun and play to kids.
      The company points to the product's packaging, which are
colorful and contain characters that are fun and appealing to kids.
Davidson has also created a Web site (http://www.davd.com) that
contains a Fun Zone for kids to play games online.
      An excellent example of a best-selling educational product
marketed differently to parents and kids may be Broderbund Software
Inc.'s "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego," a CD-ROM product (with
spin-off television shows and assorted products), that teaches kids
about geography as they assume the guise of a detective and search for
clues to find the elusive character. "Where in the World is Carmen
Sandiego" has sold more than 5 million copies since its debut. There
are currently six different Carmen Sandiego software titles available.

      The company, which pioneered in the educational software segment
in 1985 with the release of its first Carmen Sandiego product,
targeted parents and kids in different ways, first by creating a
product that contains the educational/entertainment balance.
      Parent-focused ads, which appeared in consumer software
magazines such as Family PC, PC Magazine and Home PC, conveyed the
serious but entertaining character of the CD-ROMs, in order to get 
parents to understand the educational benefit of the product, said
Jennifer Apy, product marketing manager at Broderbund. 
      Interestingly, parents also need to know that the product is
entertaining as well as educational, because, said Apy, "parents know
'good for you' products are not kid-cool, and kids won't sit with it."
      Comfy, which has plans to launch a product line for older
children ages 8 to 14 in '97, says it plans to market to both segments
again, since purchases of electronic toys and edutainment products
tend to be family decisions.
      "The main thing we have tried to do is look at the product and
design and market it from the kids' point of view," says Colmenares. 
      This perspective makes sense, and seems to be reaching the kids:
Comfy reports that they've had 6-year-olds call their 800 number to
find out more about the company's Comfy Activity Center.
      Early on in the product's roll-out, in 1994, the company also
created pint-sized kiosks which it placed in retail stores, so kids
would be attracted to trying out the product. And, after becoming
familiar with the characters in the software, the kids would get
everything from little rulers, to stickers to pencils, all with the
name of the company and its phone number, and with pictures of those
characters.  In July 1996, the company also installed the kiosks in
day care centers and Montessori schools to expose kids to the product.
      The best educational product delivers the educational component,
but makes the education transparent to kids. 
      To target  kids, and convey that the brand is  "cool,"
Broderbund cultivates licensing agreements that keep the products
fresh and "cool" in the kids' minds. he licensing agreements include
two fast-paced television shows, appearing on Fox Kids Network and the
Public Broadcasting System, as well as books, games and puzzles.
      "You've really got to strike that educational-entertainment
balance at the product level" before sending out dual marketing
messages, said Apy. (Comfy, Cynthia Colmenares, 510/668-4870; Linda

THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A SUCCESSFUL SITE

      Though Web sites suggest instantaneous opportunities to talk to
kids, follow their interests and get feedback on your products,
building a Web site that will yield important data - and keep the kids
interested - is a gradual process.
      And when it is built and monitored correctly, kids can find the
information they need easily, and companies can keep pace with kids by
changing their Web sites as fast as kids change their minds.
      LEGO Systems, Inc., based in Enfield, Conn., the U.S. division
of the Denmark-based LEGO Group, found this to be true when the LEGO
Web site went online in March.
      Though kids had written to the maker of colorful, plastic bricks
and construction sets to start a Web site, company officials instead
first informally monitored an unofficial LEGO user Web site to see
what customers were saying about the company and its products. Users
visited the unofficial Web site to talk about new products coming out,
exchange personal opinions about products and hold auctions for
hard-to-find LEGO sets.
      After six months of planning, the official LEGO Web site was
opened (www.lego.com) - without a great deal of fanfare. The company's
rationale was that a Web site is an extension of a company's brand,
and a poorly executed or serviced site could affect how customers see
the company. Instead of making global announcements and finding itself
unprepared for the volume, LEGO proceeded with caution.        
      "If you set it up too quickly, and it's lousy, that's all the
kids will remember," said Steve Hawco, director of direct marketing
for LEGO Systems Inc. "We were concerned that we would get inundated
with traffic."
      Instead, users found out about the Web site through
word-of-mouth and through exploring the Web, and LEGO saw heavy
traffic on the site in its first few months.
      Visits to the site peaked in June and July, and has reached a
steady rate, attracting approximately 10,000 visitors a week, said
company representatives. The site is maintained in Denmark, though
representatives of the privately held company declined to share the
cost of maintaining the site. Company representatives did say that
part of the maintenance costs involve how often the company refreshes
the site, something LEGO Systems has not yet determined.

Web site is a Give and Take

      LEGO's Web site has been set up to both gather information on
the kids (and adults) that use its  products, and give kids and their
parents the opportunity to customize the information they receive from
the company by allowing them to choose to receive information on
products they select.
      Along with providing information on the history of the company,
and a worldwide listing of where LEGO products are sold, the Web site
asks kids their name, gender, age, where they live, the type of
computer they have, and whether it has CD-ROM capability. The company,
which markets its products globally, asks for computer hardware
information so it knows what users around the world will be using to
look at the Web pages, and tries to take that into consideration when
designing the pages. 
  The Web site is sprinkled with LEGO bricks and characters
throughout, which underlies a basic principle of marketing on the
Intenet - the Web site should extend the brand visually, using
familiar imagery, such as LEGO bricks in this case, but it also needs
to go beyond that. The marketing challenge is how to take an existing
brand, and translate the feel of that brand onto a Web site to enhance
the brand.        
      "The entire presentation of the Web site should be in sync with,
and true to the existing brand," said Tom Robbins, vice president and
director of communications, Foote, Cone, & Belding/Los Angeles, a
global advertising agency which has created Web sites for Levi Strauss
aimed at teens.
      If you're marketing a brand with a cool, hip image, or an
educational brand identity, then the graphics, the pace, and even the
links on the site should reflect that. 
      Using the colors and characters that kids associate with the
brand is just one way way to establish that continuity. 
      On the LEGO Web site, kids are asked to supply their e-mail
address; if they do, they receive a membership certificate. They are
also asked if they want to receive e-mail on specific product lines,
with a listing of those product lines. So far, said Hawco,
approximately 25,000 users have registered their e-mail addresses.

Targeting All Ages

      One of the common frustrations of marketing a diverse product
line such as LEGO's to a customer base that ranges from 3-months- to
16-years-old is that kids within that group have very different needs
and interests.
      Taking that into consideration, the company maintains a free
club, called the LEGO Club, for kids ages 5 to 12. When kids sign up,
they receive a magazine called LEGOmania six times a year - which must
be broadly focused to reach that entire group. 
      On a Web site, it's possible to create links to information
organized by age group or product line, making it possible to talk to
kids at an appropriate level, and specifically to their interests. 
      The real value in marketing to kids on the Internet is the
ability of  the electronic medium to give kids what they ask for
almost immediately, and - if the Web site is designed well - to
customize the type of information they receive from the company.
      "Because the Internet is new and interesting, marketers seem to
have forgotten their basic marketing lessons," said Andrew Watt, COO,
Cyber Dialogue, an online consumer research and database marketing
company in New York. "If you think of the Internet as a broadcast
medium only, you are missing its potential - which is, you can treat
every one of your customers as individuals. If you can get one-on-one
with your customer, and involve them in the marketing plan, you have a
much better chance of meeting their needs."
      In addition to providing specific icons which relate to
products, another way of tailoring information is to allow kids to
select whether they want to receive e-mail on a particular product
line or new product launches, and by doing so, allow them to create
their own personal marketing channel between themselves and the
company.  And if you market your products globally, as LEGO does,
there are several other considerations in designing a Web site.
      Designers at LEGO had to grapple with which language to use,
American or British English, (the company decided on American English)
and how to design icons that would have universal appeal.

212/804-1170)

Working the Web
1. Don't assume that demographic data gathered from your Web site is
representative of your entire customer base. 
One way to validate the data collected online is to hold traditional
focus groups, and compare the results.
2. Always pre-test the Web site on kids to solicit feedback, and to
make sure it has been designed with their needs and abilities in mind.
3. Try to establish early on what type of computers most of the kids
are using to visit your Web site. Though kids generally demand lots of
graphics on the Web, if their computers can't handle intensive
graphics, the site may download and function too slowly to retain
their interest.
4. Take advantage of the electronic medium to change, and refresh your
site often - kids change fast, and your Web site should keep pace.    
5.  Additionally, marketers who create online or Internet sites for
children should become familiar with the advertising guidelines set 
forth by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council
of Better Business Bureaus.

CONGRESSIONAL HEARING TARGETS DIRECT-MAIL KIDS LISTS

      Marketers targeting kids 16 and under through direct mail,
beware: the first congressional hearing was held last month in
Washington D.C., on a bill which could affect how direct marketers do
business.
      The bill, which was first introduced several months ago, seeks
to prohibit the sale, distribution or rental of lists that contain
private information about kids without parental permission.
      Proponents of the bills say it will protect children by
preventing others from using information gathered from lists to harm
them.  Direct marketing executives support some elements of the bill -
such as a ban on the use of prison labor to process information about
kids - but contend that if the bill is passed, the direct marketing
industry will be dramatically impacted, and so will kids - who
currently receive direct mail on a wide variety of products. Congress
adjourned without taking action on the bill, and marketers will be
watching when Congress convenes again to see if the legislation is
reintroduced. (Direct Marketing Association, 202/955-5030)

NINTENDO 64 SELLS OUT

      Nintendo of America, whose marketing strategies for the highly
awaited Nintendo 64 gaming system were criticized by software
retailers and questioned by analysts, is celebrating a nationwide
sellout of the 350,000 consoles that hit retail Sept. 29. 
      The supply of the 3-D system disappeared after three days, with
more than 50 percent of the units pre-sold before the official launch
date. Executives at Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo will send small
shipments of 430,000 consoles and an undisclosed number of games to
retailers starting this week. 
      The overwhelmingly positive buzz on Nintendo 64 worried major
software outlets such as Funco Inc., which complained that the
company's low supply of consoles would leave them empty-handed during
the busiest shopping season of the year (see S2K, Sept. 18).
Nintendo's decision to release just two titles in support of the
system raised further questions about the company's market sense.
Consumer demand for the games mirrored their desire for the console.
Super Mario 64 sold at a 1:1 ratio with Nintendo 64, and consumers
purchased one copy of PilotWings 64 for every four consoles sold,
according to Nintendo. (Nintendo of America, 206/882-2040)

KIDS SHOULD REGISTER HIGH IN SUPER-MARKETING

      Kids love an outing to the supermarket - on average, kids ages 6
to 14 go food shopping about once a week -  and when they go, they are
likely to go with their parents, and influence the purchases that are
made.
      That is the conclusion of recent data collected by Simmons
Market Research in their "1995 Kids Study."  The study surveyed 2,118
kids on whether and how often they went grocery shopping, whether they
actually selected items to purchase, and the products in which they
were considered the "expert" in their family.
      Marketers should consider actually observing kids in the
supermarket to understand their purchasing behavior.
      Kids selected approximately five items per shopping trip -
though 11% of 9- to 11-year-olds picked 10 or more items.
      And when the kids are pulling products off the shelves, they are
most likely to pick breakfast cereals, candy and gum, and cookies -
the top three categories kids picked from a list of 29 food products.
      "You've got to watch the environment in which the purchasing
occurs," said Dr. Langbourne Rust, marketing consultant and consumer
psychologist specializing in kids. "Focus groups force thought to a
much higher level, but the challenge is to see how kids think when
they aren't [forced]."
      The supermarket and convenience store is a place where  kids'
marketers can find success - if they understand the many simultaneous
factors that characterize kids purchasing behavior there. It's one of
kids most favorite destinations to make purchases in (perhaps because
so many products there are actually within their budget). According to
a report sponsored by Kurt Salmon & Associates, Discount Merchandiser,
and Lisa Frank, Inc.,  kids ages 8 to 12 spent $378 annually on fast
food, groceries, snacks, candy and other food products. The 13- to
17-year-old-group spent $633 - and the majority of those purchases
took place in either the convenience or grocery store.  
      According to the Simmons study,  54% of kids ages 6 to 8, 48% of
9- to 11-year-olds, and 39% of 12- to 14-year-olds are considered the
expert in their family when it comes to breakfast cereals - not
surprising, since 90% of  American households have several varieties
of cereal in their homes at one time.  
      How do the cereal companies, and others attract kids' attention
while shopping in the supermarket?  
Rust suggests a number of approaches:
      * Directing information to the child sitting in the shopping
cart;
      * Displaying products at cart height;
      *  Designing packaging that encourages and supports children
physically interacting with it; 
      * Selecting product names carefully, so children can pronounce
them, and mothers can interact with their children (packaging with
distinctive colors, shapes and animals are good catalysts for mothers
to talk to their kids about the product); 
      * Not relying on too much text on the product's packaging for
younger kids; and 
      * Using age-appropriate text for the older set.
If you can get the kids to notice your product from furtheraway, that
works, too, said Rust. Or, once kids approach the cereal aisle, for
example, distinguish your product by adding a kid-friendly feature,
such as a handle on the box, which is perceived as an added-value
feature. Candy companies do this when they package candy in a baseball
helmet or truck. The kids perceive the toy as added value.
 Marketers are not only targeting kids, they are also trying to keep
one step ahead of all of the other cereal, candy, and cookie marketers
on the shelves.
      So, try watching what the winners are doing - and then do just
the opposite.
      "It's a question of becoming distinctive, and it is enormously
complex and subtle," said Rust. "As soon as a marketing approach
becomes formulaic, the [marketer] that wins is the one that breaks the
formula." 
(Stan Simon, Simmons Market Research, 212/373-8900; Langbourne Rust,
914/769-3113)

FROM WALL STREET TO THE CLASS BEAT

     It's a product recognized around the world, though most closely
associated with board rooms, not homerooms.
Bringing the Wall Street Journal into classrooms was not an easy
assignment for Melinda Patterson Grenier, editor and publisher of  the
6-yearold The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition. Grenier sought to
change kids' image of the Journal, and faced a complex marketing
challenge: how to market a product perceived by kids as being for
adults only.
     The goal was to see if the company could find a way to make the
product more teen-friendly, and penetrate the classroom market around
the country. This would not only serve an educational mission, but
begin building brand loyalty to The Wall Street Journal. 
     The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition is targeted to high
school student from ages 14 to 18, though gifted kids in the fifth and
sixth grades ages 10 and 11 are also reading it. The classroom edition
consists of a set of 30 copies of the newspaper per classroom, a
20-page teacher's guide, and a free poster set, for $165 a year. For
an additional $135 per year, eight videos, which are designed in a
newscast style, supplement the regular subscription package.
     The company made the product more teen friendly - by not changing
a word of copy, illustrating an important concept that many marketers
miss.
     "Kids care about the same things as adults do - jobs, money,
politics," said  Grenier. "They are sophisticated, and they don't want
to be talked down to. And you cannot go wrong by having higher
expectations for kids."
     What the publishers did do was to talk extensively with kids, and
teachers - who needed to be sold on the program - and found out how
the kids perceived the brand, and how that perception could be
changed, without compromising the editorial quality associated with
The Wall Street Journal.
     The Classroom Edition reaches about 600,000 kids per month. In
'91-'92, the Edition was in 1,200 high schools. In '96-'97, it is in
4,000 high schools, or 16% of the high schools in the U.S. Not quite
as many readers as The Journal, which boasts a circulation of 1.8
million.
     Grenier, a former school teacher and reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, took the suggestions of kids and teachers, put together a
16-page black-and-white prototype, and took it on the road to
inner-city high schools in cities like Detroit, and elite high schools
throughout Illinois.        
     She listened to what the kids had to say, and followed a
successful marketing research formula: though clearly the expert in
her product, Grenier recognized the kids as experts in the
marketplace, that is, they know all about what kids want.  The teens
had specific requests: they wanted color in the publication, a page on
politics and policy, a page that would cover careers, and more case
studies and marketing stories.  All these suggestions have been
incorporated into the product. 
     When she handed out the prototype, which contained an article
about a Tom Cruise movie and a story about McDonald's,  the kids loved
the product, and thought it was written specifically for them.
     In fact, the articles were exact reprints of those which had
originally appeared in The Wall Street Journal, though by repackaging
them according to content that would interest kids,  a kid-friendly
product was launched.  
     The publisher realized early on that in order for the product to
be successfully marketed to kids, the teachers in the classroom - who
would ultimately be the ones to purchase the product - would also have
to be included in the marketing and product development process, and
beyond.
     A teacher's advisory board was formed, to advise the publisher on
the selection of articles. This last point is crucial, because the
product not only had to appeal to kids, but had to fit into the school
curriculum and satisfy teachers. A Web site
(http://info.WSJ.com/classroom/) was also created, with two icons, one
for teachers and one for students. (M. Grenier, 609/520-4266 and S.
Russell, 609/520-4298)

ADVERTISING IN THE CLASSROOM EDITION

     The Classroom Edition has signed on several large corporate
advertisers, companies who either have an interest in marketing
directly to kids, such as Apple Computer, Inc., or companies such as
Merrill Lynch & Co, who say that teaching kids about saving and
finance is a part of their corporate mission.
     "We feel it's important to instill good savings habits in kids,
and we are hoping to create an awareness of this issue similar to the
recycling campaign of the '80s," said Christine Cooke, vice president
and manager of educational services, Merrill Lynch. "If they come to
Merrill Lynch down the road, that's nice, but we are doing this as a
community service."
     Other advertisers include International Paper Co., Texas
Instruments, Inc., Stanley Kaplan, and the Dreyfus Corp.  
     Advertisers have the option of taking out ads for an academic
quarter,  a semester, a full year, or sponsoring posters, special
inserts, or even purchasing buttons on the Web.
     A full page black-and-white ad costs $14,850. Sponsorship of a
poster is $30,000. A button on the Web is $1,500 a month, and an ad in
the teacher's guide is $5,000 per page. A black-and-white ad in The
Wall Street Journal could run upwards of $100,000.  
     Advertisers need to realize that kids represent a media-savvy
generation now. "What we are finding is that kids do not resent being
advertised to - they resent being lied to, or being talked down to,"
said Steve Russell, advertising sales manager for Classroom Edition. 
"The lesson is, you better talk straight to them, or you're done." 
     Grenier agrees that kids love learning about companies, enjoy
being consumers, and therefore enjoy the whole product - editorial and
advertising - but warns that kids today have a wider interest range. 
"There's got to be something in it just for them," says Grenier. "They
are not going to read it just because it says The Wall Street
Journal."

CHILDREN'S TELEVISION WORKSHOP, CBS SIGN PROGRAMMING DEAL

     Companies that can look beyond their individual marketing
philosophy - and focus on the larger picture - may find that a merger
can bring them new markets or add a new slant to their brand's image.
     That is one marketing message behind the recent deal between CBS
Entertainment and Children's Television Workshop (CTW), in which CTW
will develop at least three half-hour series for the network's
Saturday morning line-up.
     The first half-hour show, targeted at 6- to 11-year-olds, is
slated to appear in Fall '97.
     CTW, which has built a reputation as the leader in children's
television programming with an educational flavor ("Sesame Street,"
"The Electric Company"), has typically chosen its corporate sponsors
and directed its  marketing initiatives carefully.
     "We are very careful how we market ourselves to kids," said
Allyson Kossow Felix, vice president of marketing and communications,
CTW, based in New York. "In the pre-school arena, we don't sell
directly to kids, and we don't let our own characters promote
products. And we would never team up with an alcohol or tobacco
company."
     For its part, CBS has initiated a drive to offer at least two
hours of children's educational programming on its Saturday morning
line-up. This initiative comes after the Federal Communications
Commission has pursued the networks to try and mandate a required
minimum of hours for educational programming. The FCC has suggested
that in 1998, three hours of educational programming per week be
required of the networks.
     Independently of the CTW shows,  CBS is rolling out two new shows
with educational content for '96-'97:  Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's
Haunted House" and "Bailey Kipper's P.O.V." Additionally, two existing
educationally-oriented shows, "Beakman's World" and "Storybreak" will
return to the line-up.  In addition to the two hours of educational
programming, CBS offers such kids' shows as "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles,"  "The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat" and "The Lion King's
Timon and Pumbaa."
     Yet CBS maintains it is already careful about the advertisements
that appear on Saturday morning programming, which is generally
limited to cereals and toys. 
     "Unless a corporation decides to embrace educational TV as a
corporate mission, we will probably not attract new advertisers," said
Michael Nowacki, vice-president of daytime and children's sales, CBS.
"There is very little image-driven advertising or image selling to
kids. It is mostly product driven."
     CTW has previously and successfully entered into agreements with
other commercial networks - they currently have an hour-long cartoon
show running on the Cartoon Network called "Big Bag", and another
show, "Ghostwriter," a literacy-based program, which appears in
syndication - and insists that entering into the commercial domain
presents them with new marketing opportunities.
     "I think, first and foremost, [the deal] goes right to CTW's
corporate mission, which is to be where kids are, and this means that
more kids will get to see our programming," said Kossow Felix. 
     Though CTW's preschool programming on public television is
commercially uninterrupted, and the new shows on CBS will contain
commercials, CTW maintains that older children can distinguish between
programming and commercials. 
     CTW says that young viewers will not be confused by a
CTW-produced show on a commercial network because children don't
necessarily distinguish which network is providing the programming
they enjoy.
     And as long as two disparate companies marketing a product
together have a commitment to maintaining the integrity of the
product, there should be no marketing obstacles.
     "Kids don't perceive our programming as 'spinach television,' "
says Kossow Felix. "Kids are attracted to great programming, and are
going to watch what they like. We are already on cable, PBS, the
commercial networks, we have magazines and we're online. We have a
home video relationship with Sony.  We live in the commercial world.
We  recognize the power of our combined partnership."

PBS BECOMES ADVENTUROUS AND 'VIRTUOUS' IN PRIME TIME

     With animated shows like "X-Men" and "Bugs Bunny" catching kids'
fancy, how might a show about virtues fare among pint-sized viewers
and potential commercial partners? 
     The Public Broadcasting System, based in Alexandria, Va., is
banking on the success of its first animated primetime series,
"Adventures from the Book of Virtues." It has already secured some
potentially lucrative merchandising and promotional deals and looks to
be positioning the animated series near the top of its programming
roster.
     The primetime series premiere which aired in early September is
adapted stories from The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral
Stories ($27.50), a New York Times bestseller written in 1993 by
William Bennett.  
     Porchlight Entertainment, the producers of the series, went
full-force with the PBS product, bringing in a number of marketing and
distribution partners including Reader's Digest, Turner Home
Entertainment and Warner Resound.  This series is the largest project
that the upstart Porchlight has launched. Other Porchliht projects
include the Family Channel original "Night of the Twisters."
     "We have approached this as a major programming event," said
William Baumann, executive vice president and CFO of the Los
Angeles-based Porchlight.  The partnership-wide launch, advertising
and promotion of the series will exceed $10 million during 1996 and
1997.    
     PBS owns the home video, audio and visual rights and the rights
to promote the series.  
     The marketing push, which began nine months in advance of the
premiere, is aimed at both parents and children.  Parents, who may be
familiar with Bennett's book, expect to recognize the show's moral and
educational content.  And the show's animated characters should
attract kids, according to Baumann.
     Six episodes aired this year over the Labor Day weekend and will
air again on Thanksgiving afternoon.  Seven new episodes will premier
in January 1997 and an additional 13 to 26 episodes are expected for
1997 and beyond. The show airs at 8 p.m. in most U.S. locations.
     Philadelphia-based healthcare CIGNA Corporation, sponsors the
series, filling a 15-second advertising slot before and after each
episode.
     A major consumer product push starting in early 1997 will include
story books, coloring books, posters, magnets, activity kits, learning
toys and a series of home videos related to the PBS series. 
Initially, approximately 8,000 independent Christian bookstores,
members of the Christian Bookstore Association have secured exclusive
rights to sell the products through the Christmas season.  This
exclusive retail opportunity was part of the deal between Warner
Resound, a recognized Christian distributor, and Turner Home
Entertainment.  The products will find mainstream retailers in late
January 1997. 
     Turner recently aired an infomercial on cable to promote a series
of 13 home videos produced by Porchlight.  A series of 12 story books
from Simon & Schuster, the publishers of Bennett's book, will relate
to characters and events in the series.  
     Hamilton Projects, a New York-based licensing and merchandising
agency, contacted major toy manufactures such as Hasbro Inc., Mattel,
Playmates and Tyco to manufacture toys, board games, electronic
learning toys and activity kits related to the series. No deals,
however, have been inked. 
     Products will achieve considerable success in the Christian
market because the show's moral content appeals to Christian
consumers, according to Joanne Loria, senior vice president at
Hamilton. 
     The major element of the series' publicity campaign, led by
senior vice president Michael Gerrety of New York-based Hanson &
Schwam Public Relations, was to "make [the show] appealing to families
and children without making it too `kiddy.' "  Gerrety concedes that
you cannot sell virtues to children. "The virtue and moral aspects of
the show are included in the entertainment," he says.  
     Reader's Digest, making use of its vast household readership,
will promote the show to a select group of consumers through a direct
mail campaign.  
     PBS will move the series from prime time to Sunday mornings
during the spring of 1997 and the first 13 episodes will run in a
weekly cycle.  
     The first show, airing on 30 of the 33 PBS stations, managed a
1.9 rating/3 share according to PBS.  Each rating point represents a
percentage of television households that tuned in to "Adventures."
     To keep parents and children abreast of the show's developments,
a World Wide Web page has been created for the series
(http://www.pbs.org/adventures). Porchlight received 500 e-mail
responses since the Sept. 2 premiere and Web site hits exceeded
300,000.
     Bennett told Selling to Kids that royalties related to the series
were insignificant compared to his royalties from the licity campaign,
led by senior vice president Michael Gerrety of New ork-based Hanson &
Schwam Public Relations, was to "make [the show] appealing to families
and children without making it too `kiddy.' "  Gerrety concedes that
you cannot sell virtues to children. "The virtue and moral aspects of

     Bennett told Selling to Kids that royalties related to the series
were insignificant compared to his royalties from the book.  The Book
of Virtues remains on the bestseller list after more than 100 weeks,
selling over 4 million copies and generating $110 million in sales.
