<h1 align=center>Learning to Read -- Reading to Learn<br>
Tips for Teachers</h1>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><i>Teaching Reading to Students with Learning
Disabilities</i></h2>

<p>Reading is the single most important educational skill your students
will learn. Understanding the organization and meaning of text and
instruction in both phonics and literature is essential to helping
young children read. By understanding the prerequisite skills for
reading, teachers can build a solid foundation for their students to
learn and succeed in school. 

<h3>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</h3>

<ul>
<li>Share stories with children and invite them to explore a story's
magic.<br>

<li>Share informational texts and invite children to wonder about the new
ideas presented.<br>

<li>Take every opportunity to point out the ways in which reading is
essential to the communications of everyday life (e.g., on labels,
instructions, and signs). 
</ul>

<h3>Develop Awareness of Printed Language and the Writing System</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure students know how books are organized. They should be 
taught the basics about books-that they are read from left to right and 
top to bottom, that print may be accompanied by pictures or graphics, 
that the pages are numbered, and that the purpose of reading is to gain 
meaning from the text and understand ideas that words convey. <br>

<li>Read to children from books with easy-to-read large print. Use 
stories that have predictable words in the text. <br>

<li>Use "big books" to help children notice and learn to recognize 
words that occur frequently, such as a, the, is, was, and you. 
</ul>

<h3>Teach the Alphabet</h3>

<ul>
<li>A strong predictor of the ease with which a child learns to read is 
his or her farniliarity with letters of the alphabet. This familiarity 
is a critical building block for learning to read.<br>

<li>It is important to go beyond knowing the names of letters. Students
must also develop a sense of the purpose of letters. Help them notice
the letters in the print that surrounds them and that you share with
them every day. <br>

<li>Engage the students in activities that will help them learn to
recognize letters visually. <br>

<li>Help students learn to form the letters and encourage them to
embellish their work with their names and with other first attempts at
writing. 
</ul>

<h3>Develop the Students' Phonological Awareness</h3>
<ul>
<li>In listening and speaking, we pay attention to the meaning of
language rather than to its sound. To learn to read, however, students
must be taught to attend to the sounds, or phonology, of language. This
is necessary for them to understand how speech is represented by print.
Children with learning disabilities need special help in learning to
develop such phonological awareness. <br>

<li>Model and demonstrate how to break short sentences into individual
words. For example, use the sentence "Frogs eat bugs," and demonstrate
with chips, cards, or other manipulatives how the sentence is made up
of three words and how the order of the words matters. Using
manipulatives to make sentences, play with each word and put it in
order.<br>

<li>Develop students awareness of the sounds of individual words by
asking them to clap out syllables and to listen for and generate
rhymes. <br>

<li>Once children are comfortable in playing games with words,
syllables, and rhymes, move onto phonemic awareness.
</ul>

<h3>Develop Phonemic Awareness</h3>

<ul>
<li>Phonemic awareness refers to a understanding that words and
syllables are comprised of a sequence of elementary speech sounds This
understanding is essential to learning to read an alphabetic language.
The majority of children with reading disabilities fail to grasp this
idea. <br>

<li>In teaching phonemic awareness, the focus of all activities should
be on the sounds of words, not on letters or spellings. <br>

<li>Use strategies that make phonemes prominent in children's attention
and perception. For example, model specific sounds, such as /s/ in the
word sat, and ask children to produce each sound in isolation and in
many different words until they are comfortable with the sound and
understand its nature.<br>

<li>Begin with simple words and simple challenges, e.g., listen for
initial /s/ in sat, sit, sip, and sad ... or for long /e/ in me, see,
bee... <br>

<li>Teach students to blend phonemes into words. Begin by identifying
just one phoneme, e.g., /m/-ilk, /s/-at, working gradually toward
blending all the phonemes in words, e.g., /s/-/a/-/t/. <br>

<li>Teach students to identify the separate phonemes within words,
e.g., what is the first sound of soup? What is the last sound of kiss?
Beginning phonemes are easier to identify than final phonemes.<br>

<li>Once students are comfortable listening for individual phonemes,
teach them to break up words, into component sounds, e.g.,
/m/-/oo/-/sl= "moose".<br>

<li>Create a sequence of segmenting and blending activities to help
students develop an understanding of the relationship between sounds in
words. <br>

<li>Provide children with more support when first teaching a task. For
example, model a sound or strategy for making the sound, and have the
children use the strategy to produce the sound. Model and practice
several examples. Prompt the children to use the strategy during guided
practice, and gradually add more examples. As the students master these
skills, provide less teacher-directed instruction and more practice and
challenge. <br>

<li>Make teaching phonological awareness a top priority. Opportunities
to engage in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful,
frequent, brief, and fun. <br>

<li>Phonemic awareness is essential for learning to read, but it is not
enough by itself. It must be coupled with instruction and practice in
learning the relationship between letters and sounds.
</ul>

<h3>Teach the Relation of Sounds and Letters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Students should learn the letters of the alphabet and discriminate
each letter from the other, because each stands for one or more of the
sounds that occur in spoken words. <br>

<li>When presenting each letter, model its corresponding sound and have
children produce the sound themselves. For children with learning
disabilities, the teaching activities must be explicit and unambiguous.<br>

<li>At first, teach and work with only a few letter-sound
correspondences that have high utility in many words (e.g., /m/ in man,
mad, him, and ham). Postpone teaching less frequently occurring letters
until students have a firm understanding of how left-to-right spellings
represent first-to-last sounds (alphabetic understanding).
</ul>

<h3>Teach Children How to Sound Out Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>After students have mastered a few letter-sound correspondences,
teach them to decode words or sound them out. Begin with small,
familiar words Teach the children to sound out the letters, left to
right, and blend them together, searching for the word in memory.<br>

<li>Model sounding out the word, blending the sounds together and
saying the word The ability to sound out new words allows children to
identify and learn new words on their own. <br>

<li>Give children stories containing words that reflect the
letter-sound patterns that have been taught, and encourage them to
sound out words whenever they are uncertain.<br>

<li>Help children learn spelling conventions, such as the use of final
/e/'s to mark long vowels, by comparing and contrasting lots of
examples.
</ul>

<h3>Teach Children to Spell Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>Teach children to spell words by sounding their letters one by one.
Model the sounding and spelling process for children as they spell.<br>

<li>Begin with short words children can sound out, because these words
follow regular spelling conventions, e.g., cap, bat, and sit instead of
cape, bait or sight.<br>

<li>Begin with simple words that do not contain consonant blends, e.g., 
ham and pan instead of slam and plan. 
<br>
<li>Encourage students to use spelling knowledge and strategies
regularly in their own writing. <br>

<li>Introduce spelling conventions systematically. Begin with words
that exemplify the most frequent and basic conventions, and provide
support and practice to help students generalize from these words to
others. The goal is to help them see the spelling conventions in the
words. <br>

<li>Use words in which letter-sound correspondence represent their most
common sounds (e.g., get instead of gem). <br>

<li>Develop a sequence and schedule of opportunities that allow
children to apply and develop facility with sounds and words at their
own pace. Specify what skills to assess and when to assess them so that
you will know when to move on. Take into account each student's
background knowledge and pace in moving from sounding out to blending
words to reading connected text. 
</ul>

<h3>Help Children Develop Fluent, Reflective Reading</h3>

<ul>
<li>Help children learn to read fluently by requiring them to read new
stories and reread old stories every day. <br>

<li>Help children extend their experience with the words, language, and
ideas in books by interactively reading harder texts with them and to
them every day. <br>

<li>Relate information in books to other events of interest to
children, such as holidays, pets, siblings, and games. Engage children
in discussion of the topics. <br>

<li>In both stories and informational texts, encourage wondering. For
example, "I wonder what Pooh will do now?" "How do you think the father
feels ?" or "I wonder what frogs do in the winter? Do you think that's
a problem? Why?"<br>

<li>Model comprehension strategies and provide students with guided
assistance. <br>

<li>Point out how titles and headings tell what a book is about.<br>

<li>Help students identify the main ideas presented in the text, as
well as the supporting detail. Graphics help to reveal main ideas, and
the relationship between text and graphics helps students understand
what they are reading. <br>

<li>Point out unfamiliar words and explore their meaning. Revisit these
words frequently and encourage students to use them in their own
conversations. <br>

<li>Show children how to analyze contextual dues to figure out the
meaning of an unfamiliar word. Research shows that most vocabulary
growth comes from learning new words in reading.

<h2 align=center>GLOSSARY</h2>

<p><b>Alphabetic Awareness -</b> Knowledge of the letters of the alphabet
coupled with the understanding that the alphabet represents the sounds of
the spoken language. 

<p><b>Alphabetic Understanding -</b> The understanding that, in
principle, the left-to-right spelling of printed words represents their
phonemes from first to last. 

<p><b>Background Knowledge -</b> All children bring some level of
background knowledge to beginning reading (e.g.-, how to hold a book,
knowledge of words, knowledge of the world). Priming this background
knowledge-relating new knowledge to that which is already known-helps
children draw on their experiences as a means of understanding new
information. When sufficient background knowledge does not exist, it will
be necessary to adjust instruction accordingly.

<p><b>Fluency -</b> The ease with which students translate print to
speech. 

<p><b>Phonemes -</b> The elementary speech sounds represented by the
letters of a perfect alphabet. In the English alphabet, which is not
perfect, some phonemes are represented by combinations of letters (e.g.,
/th/, /sh/), and some letters represent more than one phoneme (e.g., c,
g, a, e, i, o, u). 

<p><b>Phonemic Awareness -</b> The awareness that spoken words or
syllables can be thought of as a sequence of phonemes. Phonemic awareness
is a sub-category of phonological awareness. 

<p><b>Phonological Awareness -</b> The ability to attend to the
phonological or sound structure of language as distinct from its meaning.
Types of phonological awareness include word awareness, syllable
awareness, rhyme awareness, and phonemic awareness. 

<p><b>Phonological  decoding -</b> Translating the letters or spelling patterns of a written word into speech patterns in order to identify the word and to gain access to its meaning. 

<p><b>Phonological encoding -</b> Writing a letter or word based on its
sounds. 

<p><b>Phonological recoding -</b>  Translating the spelling of written
words into the speech sounds they represent. 

<p><b>Print Awareness (orthographic awareness) -</b> Awareness of how
print works and how it looks. Print is made up of letters, the letters
correspond to sounds and words, and text is read from left to right
across the page.
