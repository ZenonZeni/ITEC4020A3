<h2>Industrial/Process Division</h2>
MK has been serving a broad range of industrial customers from its Cleveland office for more than 
45 years. Today, the Industrial/Process Division’s markets include food and beverage, automotive,
general manufacturing, oil and gas, chemicals, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.<p>
A key component of the division’s marketing strategy is to closely align with clients to develop
long-term client partnerships. The result is repeat business for MK and cost savings for clients
due to gains in efficiencies and speed developed through on-the-job experience.<p>
Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, Du Pont, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Geon, Sun Company and
Pepsi-Cola are among the major international clients who have turned to MK for repeat business.
MK is a leader in the concept of partnering that brings a spirit of teamwork to industrial projects.
MK has long been at the forefront of engineering technologies and today the company’s capabilities
include computer-aided design, three-dimensional modeling, simulation, computer-integrated
manufacturing, systems integration and computer networking.
Total Quality Management is a concept that is a key part of many MK services to industrial clients.
The wide-range and geographic reach of the Industrial/Process Division’s services are
demonstrated by a renown roster of major projects. In the U.S., MK recently completed the
4.2-million-square-foot Saturn plant for General Motors in Tennessee, a state-of-the art brewery
for Anheuser-Busch in Georgia and currently is performing plant renovation and upgrades at
several GM sites around the country. The division also has ongoing domestic projects for
long-term clients Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, Du Pont and for Sun Company at refineries in the U.S.
and Puerto Rico.<p>
The division’s impressive international growth has helped maintain MK’s presence around the
globe with automotive projects for GM in Mexico, Ford in Vietnam, Chrysler in Argentina and Brazil
and Adam Opel AG in Poland and Thailand. The list includes Du Pont’s adipic acid projects in
Singapore and Monsanto’s polymer plant in Thailand. Joint-venture projects in England include
SmithKline Beecham’s pharmaceutical science park, the 1.6-million-square-foot Glaxo Wellcome
Medicines Research Center and construction-management responsibilities for the
British Airport Authority and British Airways at Heathrow Airport.<p>
MK has had significant success in Mexico with MK-FINSA joint-venture projects for eight major
U.S. companies and in numerous locations in China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and former states
of the Soviet Union for the U.S. Department of State.<p>
MK’s technical capabilities, responsiveness and performance are recognized internationally.
The Glaxo Wellcome project in England, where the MK-Laing joint venture served as construction
manager, won the British Construction Industry’s prestigious Supreme Award for 1995.
MK also was named “Construction Manager of the Year,” by General Motors.
Only 154 of GM’s 30,000 worldwide suppliers were selected for this annual award.<p>
The division also services public institutional markets with construction or construction
management of prisons, schools and health-care facilities. For example, earlier this year the
company and a joint venture partner were awarded a contract to manage construction of a
658-cell regional jail in Virginia.<p>

<h2>Power Division</h2>
Few firms offer the complete range of services provided by the Power Division which engages
in the design, construction, retrofit, maintenance and decommissioning of power plants fueled
by coal, nuclear, oil, gas, geothermal and municipal solid waste. MK has constructed more than
150 power plants with a capacity of more than 40,000 megawatts.<p>
Long-time experience in the design and construction of new power plants has led to leadership
positions in many related markets. Experience and expertise in the installation of high-technology
flue-gas desulfurization systems at coal-fired power plants allows the Power Division to help
utilities meet provisions of clean-air legislation. Currently, the division is managing installation
of three replacement scrubbers at the 2,250-megawatt-capacity Navajo Station Power Plant in
Arizona, one of the largest such projects in the country.<p>
MK has been part of the nuclear power industry since its inception in the 1940s.
Today, the Power Division provides the industry with decommissioning and dismantling
services and presently is part of a team providing these services at Public Service Company
of Colorado’s Fort St. Vrain plant. The division also has strong capabilities in nuclear retrofit work,
including highly complex steam-generator replacements. MK is one of two U.S. companies
that have successfully performed these projects.<p>
As investor-owned utilities meet the competition and deregulations precipitated by the 1992
Energy Policy Act, many are planning to outsource such operations as maintenance and
modifications. The Power Division is part of a team that provides these services for the fossil-fuel
and hydropower facilities in the vast Tennessee Valley Authority system.
The team recently received a three-year contract extension, worth $256 million.<p>

<h2>Operations &amp; Maintenance Division</h2>
Facility and plant operations and maintenance services to a wide range of private and public
clients is the mission of the Operations & Maintenance Division. The division also provides
logistical, procurement and transportation services on a worldwide basis.<p>
MK operates, maintains and provides facilities engineering to many preeminent international
companies, including IBM, Exxon, Lockheed Martin, Siemens Rolm Communications, 3COM
and Tektronix. The company’s MK Integrated Facility Management (IFM) System differentiates
MK from the competition and brings considerable operational efficiencies. Highly technical facility engineering is a recent addition to the operations and maintenance
services.<p>
In the public sector, the O&M Division has considerable experience and expertise in the
operation and maintenance of military bases and other facilities. The division administers the
U.S. Navy’s Advanced Traceability and Control Program throughout the world. Operation of
toll roads in public-private partnership with government agencies is another specialty and
includes operation of the 79-mile Orlando/Orange County Expressway system in Florida
and the completed section of the E-470 tollway in Denver.<p>

<h2>MK Centennial</h2>
MK Centennial specializes in transportation engineering, design and construction-management
services to federal, state and local agencies. In addition, the division pursues international
projects, particularly in developing countries where transportation and infrastructure upgrades
are a growing need.<p>
Headquartered in Arvada, Colorado, MK Centennial has completed hundreds of
transportation-related projects in the Western U.S. and has expanded operations throughout
the world with offices in 15 states and five foreign countries. The Division maintains regional
offices in Arvada; Las Vegas, Nevada; Deerfield Beach, Florida; and San Francisco and Pleasanton,
California.<p>
MK Centennial serves the highway and bridge market with inspection, design/engineering
and construction management of highway interchanges and overpasses, HOV lane additions,
roadway construction and seismic retrofits. Among recent projects are construction-management
and inspections services for a $183-million freeway interchange and $261-million freeway
transitway in Los Angeles. MK Centennial performed preliminary engineering and is designing
the $321-million E-470 tollway being built by MK and a joint-venture partner.<p>
In addition to roads and highways, the firm serves the growing light-rail and commuter-rail
industries with design and construction-management services on track work, signaling and
electrical systems. Recent clients include the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system and the
Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) starter system. A newly entered market segment is the design
of intermodal facilities for major railroads and port authorities.<p>
Among MK Centennial’s international operations are water-resource projects in South America,
Egypt, Nepal, Bangladesh and China. In Pakistan, the firm is providing construction
management on enlargement of 1,200 kilometers of a highway through some of the country’s
most rugged terrain. Preliminary engineering and design services are underway on a
$223-million hydroelectric project in Nepal and MK Centennial continues to provide engineering
support on the $12-billion Itaipu Hydroelectric Project on the Brazil-Paraguay border -- an
18,000-megawatt-capacity undertaking that MK has been part of for 25 years.<p>
