<p><h3>PRECISION FOCUSSING ALGORITHMS FOR SPACEBORNE SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR)</h3>
Heng, A. W-C., Lim, H., Liew, S.C. and Tan, B.T.G. (1996),<br>  
    <i>International Journal of Remote Sensing. (Accepted for publication)</i>

<p>    The two-dimensional transfer function is derived from the synthetic 
    radar(SAR) imaging model.  Using this expression, the approximations 
    made in the classical range-Doppler and recent chirp-scaling algorithms
    are examined.  An alternative algorithm to the chirp-scaling algorithm 
    is presented.  Unlike the chirp-scaling algorithm, this algorithm does not
    require the transmitted signal to be a linear FM signal and can be easily
    incorporated into processors using the range-Doppler algorithm.  The 
    processing starts with range compressed data rather than from the raw SAR
    data.  Results from processing simulated point targets and the Seasat 
    Goldstone area data show comparable image quality.

<H3>GEOCODING OF SPACEBORNE SAR IMAGERY</h3>
Kwoh L.K. (1995),<br>
<i>Proceedings of Seminar on the Integration of Remote Sensing and GIS for
Applications in South East Asia, (27-29 March 95, K.L., Malaysia)</i>
<p>
In GIS applications, one often has to register remote sensing images
to the map.  Standard GIS packages usually include polynomial warping
functions to resample images to the map with some manually selected
control points.  Although such warping methods can gives satisfactory
results, they have the following drawbacks:<p>
<ol>
      <li>    large number of control points are required;
      <li>    parameters are not related to any physical phenomena;
      <li>    lack robustness to errors in control points;
      <li>    not reliable when extrapolated.
</ol>
<p>In this paper, a geocoding algorithm for spaceborne SAR images based
on a rigorous model of the imaging process is described.  The model is
based on the following considerations:
<ol>
      <li>    SAR signal acquisition and processing geometry;
      <li>    Spacecraft orbital geometry.
</ol>
<p>The imaging geometry of SAR is different from that of optical sensors
in many ways.  Optical imaging process is governed by the renowned
collinearity condition (similar to aerial photography).  For SAR
imagery, each image line is formed by the backscatter of a radar pulse
from ground features. While travelling along in the spacecraft, the SAR
emits thousands of pulses per second, with each pulse contributing to
one image line.  Ideally, the pulses are sent out in a direction
perpendicular to the flight path of the spacecraft.  But small
deviations (squint) exists and this squint gives rise to a shear in the
SAR image.<p>

For modelling of the spacecraft orbital geometry, an elliptical orbit
that satisfies zeroth order Keppler's laws is used.  This orbit is
defined by the following 6 elements:<p>

<dd>            (<i> a, e, I, w, v, Om </i>)

<p>which denote respectively the semi-major axis, eccentricity,
inclination, perigee argument, anomaly and longitude of ascending node. 
For an image which is captured over only a small arc of the orbit, it
is more practical and more accurate to use the following modified set
of orbital elements:<p>

<dd>            (<i> p, I, W, Om, ex, ey </i>)
<p>
which denote respectively the distance from centre of the earth to
spacecraft, inclination, spacecraft argument, longitude of ascending
node, <i>e</i> cos(<i>w</i>), <i>e</i> sin(<i>w</i>).<p> 

The combined model has between 8 to 12 parameters.  The parameters can
usually be computed with reasonably high accuracy from the ephemeris
information given in the imagery leader file (CEOS format).  Geocoding
using only the ephemeris information can give relative accuracy of about 200 m. 
Higher accuracy (less than 10m) can be achieved if the parameters are
refined with known ground control points.

<h3>DETERMINATION OF FRACTAL DIMENSION OF LOCAL AREAS IN IMAGES</h3>
</a>
Lim H., Lai C.H. and Oh G.L. (1995),<br>
<i>Submitted to Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1995</i>.
<p>     
Natural objects tends to have a fractal structure, and such fractal
structure is often reflected in their images.  A main parameter that
characterises a fractal object is the fractal dimension.  Estimated
fractal dimension of local areas of an image has been shown to be
effective for discriminating natural and man-made objects.  In the
context of remote sensing image classification, fractal dimension may
be considered a supplementary parameter for description of the local
texture of the image.  Since natural terrain features are the main
contents of remote sensing images, fractal models may be quite
appropriate, and parameters such as fractal dimension may prove to be
important.

<p>
Many methods are available for estimation of the fractal dimension of
curves and surfaces, such as the box method, variation method, spectral
method, multi-resolution analysis method, etc.  These methods have been
derived from the alternative mathematical definitions of fractal
dimension, but studies of the statistical characteristics of these
methods (systematic error and standard deviation) have seldem been
reported.  Furthermore, these methods often assume that a large number
of pixels is available for the estimation of the fractal dimension. 
In image analysis, where local fractal dimension is required, the
fractal dimension may have to be estimated from windows of size 32x32,
or even smaller.  It is not clear if the standard methods are able to
provide a robust estimate of the local fractal dimension.

<p>
In this paper, a thorough investigation of the systematic errors and
statistical variance of the estimators of fractal dimension is carried
out.   Fractal curves and surfaces generated by the fractal Brownian
motion method, the Weierstrass Mandelbrot Cosine functions, and the
fractal interpolation method are used as test data sets.  Three
estimators are compared: variational method, multi-resolution method
based on Haar wavelet basis, and multi-resolution method based on
Lemarie wavelet basis.  Based on the analysis of thousands of fractal
curves and surfaces, the following conclusions are drawn:
<ol>
      <li>The fractal dimension estimated by the multi-resolution
             method based on the Haar basis is superior to that by the
             multi-resolution method based on the Lemarie basis.<p>

      <li>Significant systematic errors are observed in all the
             estimators, which ranges from about 0.1 for estimates with
             2048 pixels to 0.3 for estimates with 64 pixels.<p>

      <li>For curves, 2048 pixels are needed to reduce the standard
             deviation of the estimate to 0.1.  With 128 pixels, the
             standard deviation increases to 0.2.<p>

      <li>The estimates by the variation method and the
             multi-resolution method exhibit opposing trends in
             systematic errors and statistical variances.<p>
</ol>
Based on conclusion (5) above, a new estimator for the fractal
dimension is devised by combining the variation and multi-resolution
methods. With this new estimator, the systematic error is reduced to
below 0.02, and the standard deviation to below 0.1 with only 128
pixels for fractal curves.  For images, a 32x32 window is adequate for
estimation of the fractal dimension to an accuracy of 0.1.

<h3>TWO NEW PRACTICAL METHODS FOR PHASE UNWRAPPING</h3>
</a>
Lim H., Xu, W., and Huang X. (1995),<br>
<i>Submitted to Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1995</i>.     
<p>
In phase unwrapping, an error made at a pixel has a tendency to spread
and corrupt the phase values over large areas of an interferogram.  It
is therefore important that a phase unwrapping algorithm be designed
with a mechanism to stop itself from unwrapping across a pixel at which
the phase cannot be determined with confidence.  Two new phase
unwrapping methods incorporating this requirement and have been found
to be capable of unwrapping reasonably noisy SAR interferograms are
reported in this paper.

<p>
The first method is based on a simple prediction scheme and the second
method is based on consideration of local geometry.  In both of these
methods, the phase unwrapping process begins at a location where the
phase pattern is relatively flat, thus enabling confident determination
of the phase values of the local pixels.  Phase unwrapping then
proceeds by estimating the phases of the pixels in the immediate
neighbourhood, and in this manner gradually enlarge the region of
unwrapped phase.

<p>
In the first method, the pixels of an interferogram are classified into
four categories: unwrapped, growth, bad, unprocessed.  An unwrapped
pixel is one whose phase has been determined.  The phase of an
unwrapped pixel is fixed and will not be changed in subsequent
processing.  A pixel adjacent to a newly unwrapped pixel, if not
already unwrapped, will become a growth pixel.  A pixel at which an
attempt at unwrapping fails will be marked a bad pixel.  A bad pixel
will be revived as a growth pixel if any one of its eight neighbouring
pixels is subsequently unwrapped.  All the remaining pixels in the
interferogram are classified as unprocessed pixels.

<p>
At each growth pixel, an attempt to determine its phase is carried out
as follows.  First a predicted phase for the growth pixel is computed
based on the unwrapped pixels in its neighbourhood.  Along each of the
eight directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) radiating away
from the growth pixel, the status of the first two neighbouring pixels
is checked.  If only the immediate neighbouring pixel is an unwrapped
pixel, the phase of this pixel contributes itself to the predicted
phase at a half weight.  If both pixels are unwrapped pixels, the
linearly extrapolated phase value contributes to the predicted phase
at a full weight.  The standard deviation of the contributions about
the predicted phase is also calculated.  If the standard deviation is
larger than a specified criterion, implying inconsistency in the
predictions from different directions, the attempt is aborted and the
pixel is marked bad.  Otherwise, an unwrapped phase is calculated based
on the predicted phase.  If the unwrapped phase deviates from the
predicted phase by more than a specified criterion, the attempt is
aborted and the pixel is marked bad.   If the attempt passes both of
the above tests, the growth pixel is promoted to an unwrapped pixel,
with its phase fixed at the computed unwrapped phase.  All the
unprocessed or bad pixels adjacent to this newly unwrapped pixel are
then marked as growth pixels and queued for processing.

<p>
In the second method, the basic assumption is that after proper
unwrapping, the phase values of the pixels in a 3x3 window may be
closely approximated locally by a plane.  Suppose all but one pixel in
the window have been properly unwrapped,then we may find that by adding
or subtracting 2 pi to the phase of that pixel, a better fitting plane
can be found.  Based on this idea, and adopting the mean-square error
as a measure of goodness of fit, expressions have been derived for
unwrapping up to three pixels simultaneously, provided they all lie on
one edge of the 3x3 window.  An algorithm for phase unwrapping has been
developed in which the window is pushed in various directions across
the boundary of an unwrapped region, thereby allowing the phases of the
pixels on its forward edge to be determined.  For error control, it was
found beneficial to push the window in a direction nearly normal to the
gradient of the local plane, so that the rate of phase change will be
minimised.  To prevent unwrapping across pixels of uncertain phase, a
few parameters are monitored in the process:  mean-square error of the
plane-fitting, the gradients and intercept of the fitted plane.  A
large mean-square error, or sharp changes in the gradients or intercept
of the fitted plane are all indicative of difficulty in unwrapping the
phases along that particular direction.

<h3>TEXTURE ANALYSIS OF SAR IMAGES</h3>
</a>
Liew S.C., Lim H, Tay G.K. and Kwoh L.K. (1995),<br>
<i>Submitted to Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1995</i>.
<p>
It has been generally recognized that different techniques are required 
for interpretation of SAR and optical images. Different physical 
mechanisms are involved in their image formation process. SAR is a 
coherent imaging process which introduces speckle noise. Unlike optical 
images, SAR images usually have resolution comparable to the objects of 
interest. Due to these limitations, it is not sufficient to interpret 
SAR images based on the local values of grey levels alone. In this 
paper, we attempt to use texture features in the interpretation of SAR 
images. Several measures of texture features have been proposed in the 
literature. Among them are the co-occurrence matrix, grey-level 
difference statistics, texture energy measures and fractal 
characteristics. The fractal characteristics are promising features for 
texture classification since it has been known that many natural 
surfaces are fractal in nature. It is thus possible to distinguish man-
made objects from natural ones from their fractal signatures, and to 
differentiate between different natural regions. The fractal dimension 
is one of the most important parameters for characterising fractal 
surfaces. There are several techniques for estimating the fractal 
dimension of a given fractal surface. Two of the techniques, namely the 
variation method and the multiresolution wavelet method, are used in our 
work.

<h3>Phase-Unwrapping of SAR Interferogram wiht Multi-Frequency or Multi-Baseline</h3>
</a>
Xu,W., Chang E.C., Kwoh L.K., Lim H and Heng W.C.A.(1994)<br>
<i>Proceed. Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1994</i>, pp 730-732.
<p>
Accurate determination of terrain height by SAR interferometry depends on
reliable phase-unwrapping method.  The phase-unwrapping methods in common
use are often based on teh assumption that the phase difference between
neighbouring pixels is less than pi.  Such phase unwarpping methods cannot
correctly process interferograms over steep terrain, especially in the
presences of noise.
<p>
This paper proposes a phase unwrapping mehtod based on two or more sets of
interferograms.  After removing an approximately linear term, the terrain
height can be shown to be proportional to the unwrapped phase.  With the
proportional constant being a function of the carrier frequency and the
baseline.  Interferograms of the same area formed with different baselines
will therefore have different proportional constants and show fringes of
different intervals.  When the fringe intervals are simple rational ratio,
it can be shown that by combining the two interferograms, we can effectively
generate an interferogram with a fringe interval equal to the least common
multiple of the two original fringe intervals.  This significant lengthening
of the phase wrap interval practically resolves the phase wrap ambiguity and
enable correct processing of steep terrain interferograms even in the
presence of moderate noise.  In general, the fringe intervals are not in simple
rational ratio, but a slight adaptation of the methods allows similar effect
to be achieved.
<p>
Experiments with simulated data has yielded encouraging results.  With
existing data, our experience showed that multiple baseline processing is
feasible.  Our analysis also suggests the possibility of designing
multiple frequency INSAR system with judicially chosen frequencies to
provide reliable terrain height data.

<H3>DTM GENERATION FROM 35-DAY REPEAT PASS ERS-1 INTERFEROMETRY</h3>
</a>
Kwoh L.K., Chang E.C., Heng W.C.A. and Lim H.(1994)<br>
<i>Proceed. Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1994</i>, pp 2288-2290.
<p>
This paper presents the authors' experience in DTM generation with
ERS-1 data of the region around Canberra, Australia.  
Single look complex (SLC) images were generated by both the
traditional range-Doppler method and the chirp scaling method.
The interferograms obtained showed large regions of severe `noise'
due probably to the temporal decorrelation of the ERS-1 images
which were taken 35 days apart.  The temporal decorrelation
also affected the image registration process.  Amplitude correlation
technique has been found to be more effective than the commonly used
complex correlation and phase fluctuation techniques for registration
of these images.  An adaptive algorithm that takes into
consideration the terrain slope and the quality of interferometric phase 
has been developed for smoothing the phase images.
