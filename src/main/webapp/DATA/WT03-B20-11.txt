<H1>Poland and climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>As a developed country with inefficient industry, Poland is a major emitter of greenhouse 
gases.</B>  In 1988 its emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) exceeded 460 million tonnes, representing 
2.3% of total world-wide emissions, or 12.1 tonnes per capita and 2.66 tonnes per US$1,000 of 
GDP.  These figures result partly from the country's heavy reliance on coal and lignite, which are 
carbon-intensive fuels.  Poland is also vulnerable to many of the potential impacts of global climate 
change.  Over the next 100 years, annual mean temperatures in Poland may increase by about 3.5 C, 
while January temperatures could rise by as much as 5 C.<P>
<B>Agriculture may be both positively and negatively affected by climate change.</B>  Higher 
temperatures could extend the summer growing season by 50 to 70 days. Combined with higher 
humidity, this could triple the harvest of fodder and double the production of cereal and other stubble 
crops.  Shorter and gentler winters might also permit livestock to remain in pasture almost the entire 
year.  Maize soybeans and sunflowers would thrive, and the variety of fruits and vegetables that could 
be raised would expand.  One study has suggested that total food production will increase by about 
34%.  On the negative side, climate change could encourage new and more virulent pests and diseases 
to attack crops.  And, while most crop yields are expected to rise, the staple potato crop could 
decline under warmer and drier conditions.<P>
<B>A warmer climate would probably accelerate the cycle of precipitation, 
evapo-transpiration, and water run-off.</B>  Researchers predict that evapo-transpiration may 
increase by 30% by the year 2100, while the annual runoff in central Poland may increase by 50-100% 
over the next 100 years.  This could worsen the erosion of arable land and reduce the water content 
of the soil.  Greater run-off in the early spring followed by a water deficit during the growing season 
would require a more extensive artificial reservoir system to store excess water.<P>
<B>The species composition of Polish forests would continue to change.</B>  Due in part to a 
slight warming since the 1920s, deciduous trees such as oak and beech have been gradually replacing 
evergreens such as pine, spruce and fir.  If temperatures continue to rise, broad-leafed species are 
likely to continue displacing conifers.  On the other hand, an increase in droughts and heat-waves 
could slow their growth and raise the risk of forest fires.<P>
<B>The mean sea-level of the southern Baltic Sea would continue to rise.  </B>It has already 
been rising by about 1.5-2.9 mm per year over the past century, and higher levels could subject 
Poland's northern low-lying areas - which are mostly farmland - to flooding.  Meanwhile, 18 
holiday centres situated on cliffs would be threatened by severe erosion.  With a higher sea-level 
would come increased salinity in river estuaries, coastal lakes, and ground water.  The area at risk is 
home to 700,000 people, five large harbours, and a number of industrial plants. The cost of a "full 
protection" response strategy for Poland's Baltic coastline has been estimated at US$7 billion, while 
the total cost of a "no protection" strategy would amount to $70 billion.<P>
<B>Poland signed the Climate Change Convention on 4 June 1992 during the UNCED "Earth 
Summit" in Rio de Janeiro.</B>  By 21 September 1994, the government must present a summary 
of its national climate change strategy to the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.  This 
summary will include an "inventory" of Poland's sources and "sinks" of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases.   It will also outline Poland's strategies for limiting its emissions; a key strategy will 
be to reduce its dependence on coal and lignite for 75% of its energy needs to 50% by the year 2010 
by shifting to gas and oil.  The report will also explain how Poland plans to adapt to the possible 
impacts described above and to promote research and education programmes.<P>
