<H2>Clinical Research on Schizophrenia</H2>
<A HREF="#shore"><H4>by David Shore, M.D.</H4></A>
 <HR>
Schizophrenia is the most chronic and disabling of the severe mental disorders.  People with schizophrenia often withdraw from the world and suffer terrifying psychotic symptoms--hearing voices or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thinking, or plotting to harm them.  Speech and behavior may become so disorganized that the person's actions and communications become incomprehensible and sometimes frightening to others.  Even with available treatments, most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer chronically or episodically a large part of their lives.  For many such individuals, the illness' persisting consequences--lost opportunities, residual symptoms, stigma, and medication side effects--may be as troubling as the psychotic symptoms.  It is estimated that no more than one of every five people with schizophrenia completely recovers, while one in ten eventually commits suicide.
<P>
As NAMI members know, schizophrenia research has been a top priority of the National Institute of Mental Health for almost a decade now.  Rather than focusing on a summary of one research group's work, it may be most useful to highlight a number of scientific approaches being pursued around the world.  Most of these studies are NIMH grant-funded research, some are done by the institute's Intramural Research Program, and some with NAMI-affiliated foundation support, such as NARSAD and the Stanley Foundation.  Some of the studies described below were adapted from the recent NIMH Annual Report.

<P>
Research on the Causes of Schizophrenia
<P>
Schizophrenia has been the subject of considerable clinical research, yet in many ways it remains a medical mystery.  Perhaps the best clue we have about the underlying causes of schizophrenia is that it runs in certain families.  Twin and adoption studies have generally confirmed that genetic factors play a major role, and they may well produce the neurobiological vulnerability to schizophrenia.  An international team of researchers has recently confirmed earlier reports that the frequency of schizophrenia is higher among the biological relatives than among the adoptive relatives of adoptees with schizophrenia.  More specifically, the study found increased rates of chronic schizophrenia (and related schizophrenia-spectrum disorders) in the biological relatives of adoptees with chronic schizophrenia.  In fact, in this Danish national sample of adoptees with chronic schizophrenia, the disorder was found ten times more often in their biological relatives than in biological relatives of normal control adoptees.  This study supports the idea that familial clustering in schizophrenia is an expression of shared genetic factors.
<P>
Genetic studies of large families affected by this disorder have shown that is unlikely that a single gene accounts for a majority of cases of schizophrenia.  It is more likely that schizophrenia is caused by the interaction of several genes with environmental factors, perhaps those influencing brain development and function.  While earlier reports of chromosome 5 linkage for genes associated with schizophrenia have turned out to be inaccurate, more recently there have been several exciting leads.  A number of research groups have been studying specific markers on chromosome 6, and several are confirming linkage results in the same region of that chromosome.  Thus, we may soon be able to focus research on well-documented "schizophrenia vulnerability genes."  In addition to the chromosome 6 results, there are also several reports of "hot spots" for potential linkage on other chromosomes.  During the remaining years of this Decade of the Brain, we can expect many exciting discoveries about schizophrenia's complex genetic mechanisms.
<P>
While some scientists investigate the role of genetic factors in causing schizophrenia, others are searching for a mechanism that would explain why most people with this disorder do not first show psychotic symptoms until they reach their teen or twenties.  Several have reviewed the literature on neurobiological abnormalities found in schizophrenia and concluded that abnormal pruning of neurons (the elimination of extra neurons) during adolescence may occur in susceptible individuals and that these abnormalities might then interact with other factors to produce the symptoms of schizophrenia.
<P>
New neuropathological, obstetrical, and epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal factors (e.g., flu during pregnancy) may play a role in some cases of adult-onset schizophrenia.  E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., and a group of NIMH scientists evaluated data on 23 identical twin pairs in which only one twin had schizophrenia to determine at what age they markedly and permanently began diverging from each other in motor skills or unusual behavior.  Seven of the twins who later developed schizophrenia had become permanently different from their co-twins by age five.  The other 16 twins differentiated from their co-twins between the ages of 13 and 27.  The early-divergence group differed from the others on minor physical anomalies and total finger ridge counts, both of which are believed to be determined by the end of the second trimester of fetal development.  As a result, the researchers concluded that some cases of adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with early prenatal events, which may include neurodevelopmental abnormalities and/or infections.
<P>
One of the aims of longitudinal research in schizophrenia has been to discover early indicators of adult psychopathology.  Towards this end, NIMH-Israeli High Risk Study scientists followed a group of 50 children at genetic risk for schizophrenia (having a parent with the disorder), and 50 matched controls for 25 years.  The children at risk were more likely to develop schizophrenia (as well as mood and personality disorders) than were age-matched control subjects.  This study also found that the information-processing abilities of adult children of subjects with schizophrenia fall in between those of patients with schizophrenia and those of controls and that measures of sustained attention and ability to focus provided the best discrimination between groups.  Further analysis showed that among those genetically "at risk," poor childhood scores on tests of mental focusing were associated with the development of schizophrenia and related disorders in adulthood.
<P>

Research on Treatments
<P>
Clinical experience during the past 30 years has shown that the first-generation, "typical" antipsychotic medications, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, control many of the psychotic (or "positive") symptoms in most people with schizophrenia.  Unfortunately, the "negative" symptoms--such as emotional withdrawal and decreased motivation, communication, and social skills--are generally far less responsive to these drugs.  This Decade of the Brain has brought us to the threshold of some really dramatic changes in medications available for people with schizophrenia.  Typical antipsychotic agents now in use may before long be drugs of the past, thanks to a group of "atypical" (or second-generation) medications.
<P>
Clozapine, the first of these "atypical" antipsychotics, appears to affect both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without the neurological (extrapyramidal) side effects associated with older drugs.  Clozapine can, however, produce a life-threatening side effect (called agranulocytosis) in about one percent of patients.  A newer antipsychotic called risperidone was introduced in 1994, and several experimental medications (such as olanzapine, seroquel, sertindole, and ziprasidone) are now in clinical trials and may be available in the U.S. within a year or two.  The atypical antipsychotic drugs offer the possibility of better control of both positive and negative symptoms with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and probably a lower risk for later development of tardive dyskinesia.  (Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by persistent, abnormal, involuntary movements, typically of the mouth or face.  Extrapyramidal symptoms resemble those associated with Parkinson's disease.)  Newer drugs have not been found to cause agranulocytosis.
<P>
Research continues, meanwhile, on pinpointing those parts of the brain that respond to antipsychotic agents.  Researchers have long assumed that the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic medications result from their binding to the D2 class of dopamine receptors in the brain.  However, research on clozapine found little evidence that this drug was tightly bound to D2 sites in parts of the brain, and some have suggested that effects on serotonin may be important for antipsychotic effects of the atypical medications.  NIMH-funded researchers in Sweden have used positron emission tomography (PET) scans, a neuroimaging technique, to examine the connection between the ability of a drug to bind to D2 receptors and its antipsychotic and extrapyramidal effects.  They have found that extrapyramidal side effects were associated with higher D2 binding.  This study suggests that efforts to develop antipsychotic drugs that have relatively low affinity for the D2 receptor may produce new medications with fewer side effects.
<P>
Conclusions
<P>
Research on the neurobiology of schizophrenia has accelerated, and the results of the studies may soon lead to improved treatments and new avenues for research on the origins of this disorder.  A growing body of evidence from neurochemical and developmental studies suggests that some types of schizophrenia may result from prenatal pathological processes and genetic abnormalities that affect the brain.  It is also becoming clearer that, while the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a role in the expression of the symptoms in persons with schizophrenia, other neurotransmitter systems are likely to be involved.  These findings are now playing a key role in the testing of new medications that should prove better at reducing both positive and negative symptoms, while causing fewer troublesome side effects.
