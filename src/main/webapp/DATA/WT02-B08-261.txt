<h2>Data synergies in the remote sensing of glaciers</h2>

Data synergy involves the combination of independent datasets to extract new or to 
obtain more accurate information. Work by the <a href="home.htm">SPRI 
Remote Sensing Group</a> is currently aimed at measuring
<ul>
<LI> surface topography,
<LI> surface morphology,
<LI> surface temperature
</ul>
of terrestrial ice masses using synergistic remote sensing techniques.<BR>
<BR>
A topographic map of Nordaustlandet, a small ice cap in north Svalbard, is shown 
here<BR>
<b>Image to follow</b><br>
This map was derived using a combination of both visible-wavelength and altimetric 
data. The surface topography was derived using a shape-from-shading algorithm on 
LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data, with ERS-1 altimetric data being used to 
provide suitable tie points. Such a map would be impossible to generate using either dataset 
alone; the shape-from-shading method does not work well at low spatial frequencies, 
and the altimetric dataset does not include high frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
LANDSAT visible-wavelength data provide information about the 'chemical' properties 
of a glacier and ERS-1 SAR the physical properties. The RSG is developing techniques 
to merge these datasets to improve the mapping of surface facies on glaciers and 
ice caps.<br>
<b>Image to follow</b><br>
This figure shows an unsupervised classification of a merged LANDSAT TM and ERS-1 
SAR scene of Finsterwalderbreen, a glacier on Svalbard.<BR>
<BR>
The categories in the classification contain both chemical and physical description 
and are thus more representative of the actual surface facies. A technique to acquire 
accurate surface temperatures, and hence the position of the freeze/thaw line, using 
ERS-1 ATSR and SAR data is currently under development.
