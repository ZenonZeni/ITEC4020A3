Omniview was developed by TRI largely as a result of SBIR funding from NASA and DOE. Omniview (R) is so revolutionary that it is closer to a human eye than to existing video systems. It pans, tilts, magnifies, and rotates a video image with no pointing mechanism. Omniview was developed to eliminate the camera pointing mechanism in remote viewing applications where size, weight, reliability, response or covertness are considerations. (1)<P>

In order to leverage development of Omniview, TRI has entered into several strategic partnerships with other high tech companies. In fact, TRI received a big boost earlier this year when Motorola took a minority equity stake in the company.<P>

"Motorola invests in companies with leveragable technology that may hold out a promise of spawning new applications and new businesses," says Robert Burton, vice president and general manager of New Enterprises at Motorola. "Omniview is a perfect fit with what Motorola is doing and where it is heading."<P>

While TRI intends to handle R&D, prototype development and after-market servicing for Omniview, the company has teamed up with Siemens Industrial Automation, Inc. for actual product manufacturing. TRI will be the first U.S. company not owned by Siemens to have products made at the company's high tech manufacturing facility in Johnson City, Tenn. TRI is a perfect fit with Siemens says Michael E. Washington, manager of business development for Siemens Industrial Automation.<P>

Omniview has a chance to revolutionize the image, communications, and broadcasting business, says Masamura Yamaji, CEO of Omniview Systems, Inc., a Japanese licensee. "With existing systems the picture taking side of the camera controls the image. But with Omniview, the viewer can control the image."<P>

In 1993, Benthos, Inc. teamed up with TRI, Inc. to develop underwater uses for TRI's Omniview imaging system. "It gives us an add-on capability to our standard video inspection system," says Roger Whyte imaging product line manager at Benthos Inc. In exchange for funding R&D efforts, Benthos received exclusive rights for the manufacturing and use of Omniview for underwater applications. (2)<P>
