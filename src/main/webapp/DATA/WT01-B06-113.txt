If you are involved in any legal proceeding,  you will probably hear 
terms you are not familiar with.  Feel free to ask your lawyer or 
community legal worker the meaning of these terms.  Following, however, 
is a list of definitions of common legal  terms, which can help you to 
understand legal problems and procedures.  Please note, these definitions 
are short and should not be relied on to conduct your legal affairs.<p>

offence (a less serious penalty)or as an indictable offence

the offence are more serious, or the accused is a repeat offender, 
the Crown will elect to proceed by indictment.<p>

<li><b>INDICTABLE OFFENCES:</b> Serious criminal offences. The 
procedure for conviction is strict and relatively complex, to 
protect the rights of the accused.<p>

<li><b>INFORMATION:</b> A written accusation that you have 
committed a criminal offence, made usually by a police officer 
and signed by a judge or a justice of the peace. There are two 
possible results which could follow from an information:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>you may be issued a summons to appear in court on a certain date or
<li>a bench warrant may be issued for your arrest.<p>
</ol>

<li><b>INJUNCTION:</b> A court order restraining a party from 
doing some act. Injunctions may be either permanent or temporary.<p>

<li><b>INTERMITTENT SENTENCE:</b> A prison term of 90 days or 
less given to a person convicted of an offence. An intermittent 
sentence allows the person to serve the prison term in intervals 
(i.e. weekends) over a longer period of time.<p>

or justice of the peace releasing the accused from custody on his 
or her own bond or promise to appear.<p>

legal services but cannot otherwise afford them.<p>

right of prisoners to remission, or time off  for good behaviour. 
As much as one-third of an inmates sentence may be served in the 
community under supervision.<p>

the police to a particular crime under investigation.<p>

<li><b>PAROLE:</b> The release of a person from prison before the 
end of the sentence.  The person continues serving the sentence 
outside prison under supervision.  The released prisoner must 
obey specific conditions of parole or he/she will be sent 
back to prison.<p>

<li><b>PLEA BARGAINING:</b> Negotiations between the defense 
counsel and the Crown attorney concerning the charges against 
the accused, and the pleas of the accused. The Crown may accept 
a guilty plea on a lesser charge instead of incurring the expense 
and problems of a trial on the original charge.<p>

<li><b>PRE-SENTENCE REPORT:</b> A description of the accuser’s 
family life and personal situation, prepared by a probation 
officer which the judge uses to help in deciding an 
appropriate sentence.<p>

spend time in jail.<p>

own recognizance when the judge or justice of the peace gives 
permission for the accused to be released on bail, subject to 
the conditions specified on the appropriate form.<p>

<li><b>REGULATION:</b> Legal rules made under the authority of 
a statute by the Cabinet, but not requiring the approval of 
Parliament.  Regulations usually deal with relatively minor
matters, leaving the major aspects of a law to the statute.<p>

<li><b>SUMMARY OFFENCES:</b> Less serious criminal offences 
and offences against provincial laws (i.e. highway offences). 
The procedure for conviction on a summary offence is less 
complicated than for the more serious indictable offences. 
Possible maximum punishment of six months in jail and/or a 
$2,000 fine.<p>

<li><b>SUSPENDED SENTENCE:</b> A punishment given to a person 
convicted of an offence which does not require the person to 
spend time in jail.<p>

<li><b>TESTIMONY:</b> Statements made in court by the witness 
under oath.<p>

<li><b>TORT:</b> A civil wrong caused by an act or an omission; 
a violation for which an injured party may sue.<p>

<li><b>WRIT:</b> Written orders issued by a court.<p>

<li><b>YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT:</b> A federal law which sets out 
how young people will be treated if they are suspected of having 
committed a criminal offence. The Act applies to anyone over
