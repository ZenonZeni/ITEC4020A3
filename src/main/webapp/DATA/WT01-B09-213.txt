<EM>Makalu-Barun National Park and Conservation Area Management Plan</EM>, submitted
by the Task Force for the Makalu-Barun Conservation Project, November 1990.<BR>
This is the compilation of results and recommendations of the four Components,
based on a two-year study conducted by the Task Force (1988-90) wherein most of the Working Papers were prepared. The Management Plan calls for the establishment of the MBNPCA, with primary objectives being to protect this area of unusual natural beauty and biological diversity, to improve the socio-economic conditions of local people, and to develop models for sustainable conservation and development. Implementation of the Plan's policies incorporate traditional management systems as much as possible and the active   participation of local people. Training and availability of production credit for income generation are key components, as is education of both children and
adults, particularly women. The Plan gives an overview of the issues, recommends policies and programs, and presents the administration structure of the MBCP. <BR> <STRONG>85 pgs.</STRONG>

A detailed plan outlining MBCP's policies and programs to conduct economically and environmentally sustainable development activities with maximum community participation in the Makalu-Barun Conservation Area. Five-year time-lines identify activities in forest management, livestock and grazing, educational training, infrastructure, credit facilities, horticulture, rural industries (e.g., lokta, allo, bamboo products, cash crops, medicinal plants, etc.),     slash and burn, intensive agriculture, marketing development, culture conservation and human services with a summary budget.<BR>  <STRONG>176 pgs.</STRONG>

and Conservation Area, with specific policies and strategies for natural resource management, livestock and agricultural activities, tourism, income generation, infrastructure development and education/research; outlines the roles and responsibilities of Project partners (HMG and Woodlands), sets forth
administrative and staffing arrangements, facilities and equipment needs, and summarizes program costs. <BR>    <STRONG>97 pgs.</STRONG>

Underscoring the MBCP's strong commitment to ongoing research, providing data upon which sound conservation and community development decisions can be made, this plan prioritizes proposed research activities highlighting slash-and-burn, livestock and pasturage, non-timber forest products, wildlife depredation and cultural studies, and prescribes an institutional structure for guiding and reviewing such research. Research permitting procedures and assistance services are laid out, as is a general budget for each study activity. <BR> <STRONG>56 pgs.</STRONG>

<EM>"Faces of a Reservation: A Portrait of the Warm
Springs Indian Reservation"</EM><BR>
By Stowell, C.D, Oregon Historical Society Press, 1987. 200 pages. ISBN 0-87595-203-8<P>
Text and photographs by Cynthia D. Stowell<P>
High in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA lies the Warm Springs Indian
Reservation, a cultural and economic powerhouse that could be a model for
many mountain peoples.  Following the theme "Paying for Mountains", this
case study illustrates, more than anything, the critical importance of
strong local leadership.  Through capable decision-making, coupled with
persistence, a long-term outlook, deliberate diversification, and an ability
to adapt to changing circumstances, the Warm Springs Indians have created a
homeland that offers decent jobs as well as cultural richness.
<P>
Ancestors of the people of Warm Springs are believed to have occupied what
is now Oregon for at least 11,000 years.  As a result of the westward
expansion of white settlers, in 1855 a treaty was signed between the tribes
of middle Oregon and the U.S. government.  This treaty ceded 10 million
acres of land in return for the equivalent of 150,000 dollars in tools,
clothing, provisions, salaries, and the right to continue fishing at
traditional sites.  Half a million acres of poor mountain land on the edge
of their traditional range was set aside as the Warm Springs Indian
Reservation, where several tribes, including the Sahaptin, Wasco, and
Paiute, were forced to relocate.
<P>
Many Indian reservations have lost huge portions of their acreage or have
been terminated altogether since their establishment more than a century
ago.  Warm Springs has been lucky to have had leaders who effectively fought
the many attempts to reduce the size of their reservation, including
privatization (and subsequent re-sale to non-Indians), inaccurate surveys,
and frequent changes in the legal status of reservation land.
<P>
In 1957, a major setback -- the loss of traditional salmon fishing sites on
the Columbia River, due to flooding caused by The Dalles dam, was turned to
advantage.  The Tribes negotiated for a 4 million dollar settlement from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and proceeded to invest this money wisely in
their own future.  Rather than distributing the entire settlement among
tribal members (as is commonly done), the money was held in trust for the
reservation as a whole.  
<P>
The first big expenditure was a university study of the reservation's
natural resources and their potential for sustainable economic development.
Deliberate diversification led to investments in a number of economic
activities, about half of which were successful.  Today, the fruits of this
policy include a stable forest products industry, a luxury resort, a
hydroelectric plant (plus rental monies from two utility-owned dams), and
more jobs than people to fill them.  The reservation is filled with young
people, and a lively museum/cultural center celebrates the cultures of the
Tribes, both past and present.
<P>
One idea comes through clearly -- whatever course the wise and resilient
people of Warm Springs take in the future, it will be of their own choosing.
