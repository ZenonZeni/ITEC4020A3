<p><i>Chicago, IL, April 15, 1996   -- </i>At the 5th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Gynecologic Endoscopists (ISGE), 
Computer Motion, the world’s leading supplier of medical robots, previewed its next generation product - AESOP 2000 with Voice Control.  
AESOP 2000 (pronounced “eesop”) is the second generation of the company’s flagship product, and will feature the most intuitive interface 
available - the ability to understand a surgeon’s voice commands.  This allows the surgeon to use spoken English (instead of a Foot or 
Hand Control) to precisely control the position of the laparoscope.  Stable vision and precise motion in laparoscopic procedures can now be 
controlled with simple voice commands.<br>
</p>
<p>“The advent of AESOP 2000 with Voice Control is a significant stride forward in enhancing surgical performance through advanced robotic 
technology,” said Gene Wang, CEO of Computer Motion.  “AESOP 2000 exemplifies our commitment to delivering world-class medical robots.  
This company will continue to define new ways that will increasingly enable surgeons to perform surgical procedures more effectively and 
help hospitals reduce operative costs while improving the quality of care delivered to the patient.”<br>
<br>
<p>AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) is the first and only FDA cleared surgical robot.  AESOP 1000
 was first introduced in October 1994 and has been installed in over 100 hospitals and surgery centers.  AESOP 2000 will feature a more 
compact Controller that meets the performance standards and electrical safety requirements of the European Community.<br>
</p>
<p> “The robotic arm returns direct control of the operative view to the surgeon and provides a motionless image,” said Dr. Charles E. Miller, 
a leading visionary in gynecologic endoscopy and Co-Chairman of the 5th Annual ISGE Meeting.  “AESOP 2000 goes the next step by using the most 
natural interface possible.  The use of simple voice commands makes control of the robot seamless and perfectly intuitive.”<br>
</p>
<p>Computer Motion’s core development team, led by Chief Technical Officer and Founder, Dr. Yulun Wang, has worked together for over ten years 
and holds several key patents in robotics for medical applications.  The company is currently developing new products for surgical applications 
which leverage the core technologies underlying the AESOP family of products.<br>
</p>
<p>“The ability to control AESOP using simple voice commands is a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of surgeon-to-machine interfaces,” 
said Dr. Duncan J. Turner, a leading gynecologic endoscopist at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, CA.  “This is the first step toward enabling 
us to control all the peripheral equipment in the operating theater which presently requires the assistance of another person.”<br>
</p>
<p>Product availability of AESOP 2000 is pending 510(k) marketing clearance by the Food & Drug Administration.  Computer Motion anticipates 
clearance by the third quarter of this year.<br>
</p>
<p>Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics.  The company’s mission is to enhance surgeons’ capabilities and 
improve outcomes while reducing costs in the operating room using computers and robotics.  Computer Motion is privately held and is based in 
Goleta, CA. The company’s website is http://www.ComputerMotion.com.<br>
