<h2 align=center> A Lasting Impression  </h2>
How would you like the first impressions that your young elementary child receives during his or her very important and formative years in education, be that of witch craft and the occult? That is exactly the lasting impression that your child receives from the curriculum entitled Impressions. Impressions is published by Harcourt Brace and Jovanovich (HBJ).
<p> Let me share with you some excerpts from some of the Impressions curriculum that is written for Kindergarten through sixth grade.
<p> "A real witch is easily the most dangerous of all the living creatures on earth. That's a pretty horrifying thought. More horrifying still is that real witches don't even look like witches.
<p> They disguise themselves as nice, ordinary ladies." (From: Cross the Golden River, project book, p. 42.)
<p> "Have the students discuss the belief in fortune telling. What aids does someone use, for example: Tea leaves, palm reading, tarot cards, crystal balls."
<br> (From: Sixth grade teachers resource book, p. 58.)
<p> "And he looked in another dark place and saw nothing. And then he lifted a curtain to look in a third dark place, and he saw it-it isn't easy to say what he saw. There were bodies and bones, and all sorts of horrors. So then Zini knew his wife was a witch. ....Zini tried to run away, but they rushed at him and dragged him into the cave. They tied his hands behind his back and stood him before the Chief. 'You deserve to die for this,' said the Chief. 'But I will spare your life on one condition. Bring be the hearts of your mother and sister and you shall live. Not only shall you live, but you shall become one of us. We will turn you into a mighty witch, and you shall help your wife to work evil.' Then he ordered the creatures to free Zini's arms, and told him to go home.
<p> 'To-morrow night I shall expect you again, with your offering of hearts," he said. 'If you do not come, I shall see to it that your wife skins you alive.'"
<br> (From: Teachers Anthology 3 pages 16-17. Story title: Zini and the Witches, by Ruth Manning-Sanders)
<p> In a story titled The Little Mermaid, found in the fifth grade Teachers Anthology p. 24, a witch cuts off the mermaids tongue, the witch scratches her breast and lets her black blood drip into the cauldron, and she makes a potion from it.
<p> From the sixth grade Teachers Anthology page 63 there is a story entitled "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" which details a description of cutting off a head, a bleeding, headless body. Yet the head still talks.
<p> In the fifth grade reading book, page 11, from the story entitled, Thread the Needle Beauty and the Beast, we read: "We have just the thing for you." roared the giants. "All day long we have been digging a pit just for you. And so that you won't be bored, we have stuck sharp knives and razors into the sides of it so here goes." They flung the prince into the pit. By the time the prince reached the bottom, he was cut into a thousand pieces. When the prince remained silent, the giants disappeared."
<p> "An old gnarled stump of a woman" was working in her garden, ..."when all of a sudden she found a hairy toe. 'Gwot!' cried the old woman and ran with her beans and the hairy toe back to her house and locked all the doors and the shutters too. That night the old women stood at the stove, stirring a pot of stew. She stirred the beans she had picked and an old Knotted spud. And floating on top of the pot was the hairy toe. 'Gwot!' cried the old woman as she sat down to eat, devouring and licking with glee every last morsel in the pot. Then she smacked her lips, patted her belly, and crawled into bed." Later in the story the women says, "I ate it!"
<br> (From: Teacher Anthology 2, page 23. Story Title: The Hairy Toe, by George Mendoza.)
<p> "The boots Kicked and clomped, twisted, turned, and in mad, frantic frustration banged me this way and that against the fence, until I was bruised and crying from the pain, holding on for life and in despair that there would be no end to the contest until my arms were torn from my body and I was carried off a horrible broken and bleeding stump to greet my mother and father without even the arms to hug them before we were brought to our end."
<br> (From: Fourth Grade Teachers Anthology, p. 21.)
<p> In "Cross the Golden River" project book page 80, project #1 entitled The Sorcerer's Apprentice, the teacher tells the children:
<ul>
 <li> "The sorcerers are in need of new apprentices. Form small groups of sorcerers to decide how to go about finding your new assistants."
 <li> "Having a meeting with other sorcerers and trading the apprentices that you have now;"
 <li> "Creating a poster to advertise for a new apprentices."
 <li> "List all the necessary qualifications that you think your new assistant should have. What background information do you need to know about the applicants before you discuss the position with them face to face? Create an application form to be filled out by the people who would like the job."
 <li> Conduct a group interview session in which there are several applicants and several sorcerers interviewing."
 <li> "Can you think of a situation in which a sorcerer might have to cast one of these spells?"
 <li> "How do you think the sorcerer would say the spell?"
 <li> "Would the sorcerer write the spell down or learn it by heart?"
 <li> "you could be at a sorcerers' convention where the sorcerers are trading the spells." Project # 2 page 92. says:
 <li> "Use modeling clay to create some mythical creature that might be associated with sorcerers or wizards."
</ul>
On pages 50-52, there is a play which the children act out entitled, "The Beamy Brown Eye". The play is very graphic which such lines as, Narrator: "The witch beat on a tombstone with the two long thigh bones." Witch: "Has anyone down there seen my beamy glass eye? My beamy brown eye?: Narrator: "The witch used her rusty key to open the graves. The ghost and skeletons arose from the ground."
<p> The undermining of parental authority is also a common theme. In the Teachers Anthology for fourth grade p. 78 we read: "School was a sort of punishment. Parents always want to punish their children and school is their most natural way of punishing us."
<p> The impressions series is definitely troubling to many for good reason. "One scholarly survey found "Violence/degradation and death" in 27%; "negativity and despair," in 27%; "witchcraft/magic/animism," in 22%; and "bizarre/unusual illustrations," in 38% of the book. Also, sorcery and witchcraft appeared in 52% of all the reading selections."
<p> This impressions series has become so controversial in so many states, that Harcourt Brace and Jovanovich, the publisher, has published a defense kit. These defense kits as well as a bigger three-ring binder is being provided to, superintendents, school boards, and administrators so that they can deal with the outcry from parents.
<p> Janet Spalding, director of sales support services for HBJ, includes a letter in the binders that "contains this underlined warning: 'Please use the information in this notebook with discretion.'" This notebook is so secretive that in Fairbanks, Alaska, Cheri Hensley who was visiting Jan McNelly, director of curriculum for the Fairbanks School District, had the binder ripped out of her hands. "Hensly said she looked at the binder for a few minutes before McNelly saw her and ordered a secretary to take it. 'They snatched it right out of my hands,' Hinsley said, 'Jan McNelly said, 'This is not for public viewing.' She said that came right from the publishers." Hensley returned to the district office with her attorney and was permitted to see the binder. Hensley said that some pages that she had seen in her first visit had been removed. "The kits do not have numbered pages, making it difficult to detect whether pages were removed."
<p> In December of 1990, in Box Elder S.D. at a school board meeting, Superintendent John Sweet who was supposed to be objective in his implementation of curriculum, was caught reading directly from the (HBJ) binder. "Bonnie Harrison, chairman of the 'impartial' reconsideration committee, also read from the HBJ defense kit in her report." When Jan Spalding, who was also at the meeting, saw and heard from Carl Rehberg, a concerned parent, that he had obtained a copy of the defense kit, she was ticked. "Sheila Kistler, a parent, said she was sitting near spalding at the meeting and watched for her reaction when Rehberg announced that he had a copy of HBJ's defense kit. 'She turned to the guy she was with and said, 'how did they get their hands on that?'" "When asked about the incident, spalding said, (listen to her stumble), 'I was sitting next to a school official and Cary Lindsay, so if somebody heard it....I mean, I didn't say that....I was sitting next to two school officials as a matter of fact. I don't know how she could have heard my comment. First of all, I didn't make that comment, and second of all, I don't know how she could have heard it because...I don't even need to answer that'"
<p> When Jan Spalding was asked by someone whom she thought was on the side of HBJ, what is a defense kit? She replied, "It is a distillation and condensation of the material in the binder. It's easier to use, plus it does not contain some of the sensitive information in the binder." When asked, what she meant by sensitive information she replied. "Sensitive information like from other districts which have fought parents and have developed rebuttals and techniques for defending themselves against parents. It's very important that the binders do not fall into the hands of the opposition because they are our ammunition."
<p> Many experts are alarmed by what they see in the impressions series. Listen to what a few of them have to say:
<p> "After reviewing this curriculum, a number of serious concerns were raised in our minds about its literary value and actual purpose. ....We object to a great deal of the curriculum's content which centers on witchcraft and occult-related themes. We believe that many of the stories in curriculum encourage youngsters to seek out and develop a relationship with negative supernatural powers.... Repeated story themes of ghost, demons witches, and the use of spells desensitizes youngsters to what is in reality a very frightening part of life. The use of repeated chanting, as encouraged in this literary curriculum, has long been known for its hypnotic or trance-like effect and this technique is clearly a part of present-day occult rituals. ...In our professional opinion this curriculum content and the techniques it espouses cultivate a susceptibility in youngsters to illustrations in this curriculum are exactly of the type we have personally observed in working with victims of ritualistic abuse and occult involvement. ...The methods that are used as well as the story content is strikingly similar to very destructive occult practices and because of this, we would consider this portion of the curriculum to be potentially dangerous for youngsters." One of the members of the Professional Response Team is Sergeant Paul Ruffolo, of the Naperville Police Dept., Occult crime investigator and consultant as well as the lecturer for the Office of International Criminal Justice. The other five members are also specialist and experts in the Occult and ritualistic behavior. These people know of what they speak.
<p> Police officer Thomas C. Jensen of San Jose, California has said, "this does affect children, I see how it affects them when they get older in criminal activity."
<p> "Fred Eisenbraum, a occult crime investigator for the Rapid City Police Department, said exercises from Impressions mirror those in books that teach beginning witchcraft, and he read several examples at a hearing on Impressions before the Douglas School Board in Box Elder South Dakota in December of 1990. 'We are beyond imagination here, these are real rituals that are detailed in these books and many more in my office.'"
<p> My office has received stacks and stack of information on Impressions from concerned parents from all over the country. A few of the following quotes were compiled by a group of Illinois parents, who sent the Impressions material to a number of "experts" for their opinions on the curriculum. Here are what these experts had to say:
<p> Sergeant Tony Pearsall of the Vallejo Police Department, and Youth Services and Occult Research has this to say about Impressions. "It crosses the line from simply 'exposing' to actually 'propagating' a religion."
<p> Officer Greg Doyle of the Upland Police Department: "School children at that age level do not have the ability to discern between fact and fiction. Children will tend to pick up on the unreality and incorporate it into the way they deal with life."
<p> Thomas C. Jensen of the San Jose police department has been researching and investigating the occult since 1985, responded with these written words. "The Impressions series is a breeding ground for the occult, involving ritual activity such as chants, spells, lighting candles in a circle and fortune telling. This activity is all consistent with witchcraft or the Wicca religion. On page 55 of the 2nd grade teacher anthology, it reads, 'Where ever there is hunger and sickness it is because the spirits of the dead are unhappy.'"
<p> Linda Rawson, a child abuse specialist for Yupcaip Joint Unified School District and 17 other School Districts said that what concerned her about the Impressions series is "the thought implied that there is no one in this world you can trust."
<p> Michael Rattray, a private practitioner has said, "The material...sets up in them a value system which is not absolute but relative to their own desires."
<p> With out a doubt, because of the stacks of material that I have on Impressions, as well as owning the series myself, I could continue to share with you page after page of disheartening information. I think that I have certainly shared enough information with you in order to prove my point. The point that this curriculum definitely leaves as impression. After all, everything we do, see, or hear, leaves an impression. The question is whether it is a good or bad impression. What type of impression do you think is being left on the young and impressionable minds of the children who are subjected to such teaching?
