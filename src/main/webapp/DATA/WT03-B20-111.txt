<h1>Fossil Fuel: Coal</h1><p>
<p>
The United States has abundant coal resources, and coal is the least 
expensive
fossil fuel on an energy-per-Btu basis.  But environmental issues related 
to
coal-fired power-generating plants could limit its effectiveness.  New 
clean
coal technologies will allow coal to meet emission requirements 
established by
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Coal is a solid fossil fuel mined in several parts of the United States 
from
open pits (59%) and underground mines (41%).  Bituminous/sub-bituminous 
coal
provides 89% of domestic demonstrated reserves.<p>

Mining of western U.S. coal--typically low-sulfur coal from open pits--is

projected to increase from 41% in 1992 to 47% in 2010.<p>

Annual domestic coal production is about 1 billion tons, with about 100 
million
tons exported to Canada, Japan, and Italy.<p>

Domestic in-the-ground coal resources are estimated at 4 trillion tons.
Estimated recoverable-coal reserves total 261 billion tons--more than 200 
years
supply at current production rates.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Coal is an abundant domestic resource that strongly supports the mining
industry and provides numerous jobs.<p>
Coal is the least expensive electrical energy source.<p>
Coal provides a dependable resource and technology for baseload 
electrical
generation.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
The principal use of coal is electricity generation by utility companies 
(87%
in 1992); industrial use (11%) is declining.<p>

Since 1984, coal has been largest source of domestic energy (33%, or
22 quadrillion Btu in 1992).<p>

Coal provides more than half the energy consumed by utilities to produce
electricity (55% of total energy, 81% of fossil fuel energy, or 16 
quadrillion
Btu in 1992).<p>
Coal is the least expensive fossil fuel on energy-per-Btu basis 
($1.42/million
Btu in 1992).<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
Coal production is projected to increase to 1.2 billion tons in 2010, 
providing
35% of domestic energy production.<p>
Coal's cost per Btu is expected to rise by less than 2% until 2010, thus
maintaining its price advantage over other fossil fuels.<p>
<p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
Coal is not well suited to peaking electrical generation.<p>
With today's technology, coal is a major source of air pollution (66% of 
total
U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions) and greenhouse gases (36% of total 
man-made
carbon emissions).<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
Large-scale retirement of coal and nuclear baseload electric plants will 
begin
around 2000; these plants could be replaced with clean coal 
technology.<p>

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 place new requirements on future 
power
generation; these could be met affordably with clean coal technology.<p>

The worldwide market for clean power technologies will range between
$270 billion and $750 billion during the next 20 years; this is a
tremendous opportunity for U.S. industry and jobs.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Dramatically improved coal liquefaction technologies--to replace imported

oil--have cut projected costs in half to $35 per barrel, matching the 
peak 1981
cost for crude oil (recent costs have been around $20 per barrel).  <p>

Today's coal-fired power plants average 33% efficiency (energy conversion 
to
electricity); new technologies are projected to greatly improve 
efficiency
while reducing air pollution per amount of coal:<p>

Low-emission boiler systems (43% efficiency)<p>

Pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (50% efficiency)<p>
Integrated gasification combined cycle (52% efficiency)<p>
Indirectly fired cycles (55% efficiency)<p>
Gasification/fuel-cell combinations (60% efficiency, or 85% with
cogeneration).<p>
