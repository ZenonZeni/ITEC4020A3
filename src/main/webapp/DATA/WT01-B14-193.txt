Dear Mr Davies,
<p>


MONDEX ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER CARD<br>
TRADE DESCRIPTIONS ACT 1968
<p>
After some considerable time examining what may have
appeared a straightforward matter, I am now in a
position to let you know how the matter has been
resolved.
<p>
Having finally gained access to the internet and read the
information available relating to Mondex I believe that
the relative part of that information could be treated as
an advertisement.  I also noted that words had been
changed from the original entry which you sent to me. I
will return to both these matters later in this letter.
<p>
I took the opportunity to meet Mr Capelthorne of Mondex
International on 12 June to seek explanation of the
system, having had the chance to see the internet
statements. I understand the following to be the system
operation.
<p>
Loading a card shows on customers bank statements.
That is to say, there is no other paper record of the
transaction as would be the case in credit card
transactions having monthly statements.
<p>
The retailers transaction to pay in Mondex cash shows
on his bank statement but nothing ties the customer to
the electronic money used.
<p>
The transaction log on the card can be read by the
cardholders electronic wallet.  The previous ten
transactions are identified as amount, trader and date;
this includes personal transfers and load-up, which are
not identified.
<p>
The traders till chip retains the last 300 transactions as
card number, value and date.  The trader cannot trace
the customer as  the Personal Identification (PID)
Number is only traceable through the card issuing bank
and is not disclosed under the banks duty of privacy to
its customer.  The PID is required in order for the till to
read the card and conduct the transaction.
<p>
In addition, the customer uses a 4 digit Personal
Identification Number (PIN) to free the card for loading
from ATMs and to lock/unlock the card for access
authorisation. Lost cards can be read if not locked by the
card owner.  The card is not defaulted to lock when sent,
as it is of no use to anyone until given a PIN by the user.
The user must choose to lock the card, and must unlock
it for transactions to take place.  An unauthorisd user
can only use or read the card if the PIN is known or
discovered, otherwise, after a set number of attempts to
discover the PIN, the card locks up and is no use to
anyone.
<p>
It appears the customer is identified to the trader, as in
paragraph seven above and, ultimately, the bank, by the
300 previous transactions.  Each of these will soon be
superseded by further transactions and drop off the
end of the list.  These can be monitored by the bank and
could be used for marketing purposes.  This is the audit
trail and ultimately could be sold to business users for
third party marketing. I am assured this does not occur at
present.  I am assured that descriptions will be
appropriate and data protection issues addressed if this
avenue is pursued.
<p>
Mondex International has changed the word
anonymous to private as a description within the
internet promotion.  This word seems to have more
appropriate meanings than anonymous, reflecting the
limited access to information, equating with the privacy
of a (pocket) wallet where the information is not for third
party consumption, but is available to unauthorised
people.
<p>
The card system has checks and balances, which
means that the amount of information available to third
parties is protected or currently not available at all.
<p>
The potential exists for unauthorised use of transaction
information by banks, traders or third parties, but no
evidence is available that this stage has been reached.
Currently, no false trade description has been
demonstrated.  The POS (Point of Sale) material makes
no claim for privacy.  The only claim was made in a
press release and as explained previously, is not within
the scope of a trade description.
<p>
A privacy claim is made, via promotional material
(advertisements) on the Internet.  I do not believe this is
the issue which should be used to test whether the
material on the Internet is an advertisement.  More
correctly, the issue relates to a trial of the card, and the
pitfalls discovered should be corrected by negotiation
and discussion.
<p>
To this end I am making my colleagues in the City of
London Trading Standards aware of the complaint,
since the card company is based in their area.  I have
invited Mondex to discuss with them and concerns or
proposed descriptions.
<p>
Thank you for bringing this complex matter to my
attention and for your patience over an enquiry which
may at times have seemed to have become bogged
down in bureaucracy.
<p>
Yours sincerely
<p>
Robert Gilham <br>
