PRESIDENT'S RULE IMPOSED IN UTTAR PRADESH

In the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, no political party has secured a 
majority, which has resulted in president's rule in the state.  The National 
Conference has been elected to power in Jammu & Kashmir, while in Gujarat, the 
Mahagujarat Janata Party has assumed power.  Former Prime Minister Narsimha 
Rao continues to be involved in legal problems and has been accused in three 
different cases.

The assembly elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh have resulted in a hung
assembly with no political party securing a majority.  The governor has
imposed president's rule in the state.  Even though the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) has secured the highest number of seats, it falls short of a majority.
Both the Congress-Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party-United Front
alliances, in an attempt to keep the BJP from assuming power, have been unable
to arrive at a political understanding.

The National Conference (NC) has been elected to power in the assembly 
elections in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.  The NC, which had an electoral 
alliance with the Janata Dal, secured a decisive two-thirds majority.  The new 
Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah has been sworn in and will head the first 
popular government in the state after seven years of political turmoil.

The Mahagujarat Janata Party (MJP) has assumed power in the state of Gujarat
ending 35 days of President's rule.  Shankersinh Vaghela has been elected the
new Chief Minister of the state.  Earlier, Vaghela had broken away from the
state unit of the BJP which resulted in a split in the party and the dismissal
of the BJP government in Gujarat.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has charged former Prime Minister
Narsimha Rao, for his involvement in a bribery case.  A Delhi court has issued
a non-bailable warrant against Rao for his role in a forgery case.  In a third
case involving cheating, Rao will have to appear before court on November 6.

OUTLOOK

The conflict of interest between the Congress Party and the United Front
government, dissent amongst the constituents of the UF government over the
issue of supporting a Congress-BSP government in the state of Uttar Pradesh
and the likelihood of former Congress Party members rejoining the party,
suggests the possibility of the Congress Party withdrawing support from the UF
government.

RBI ANNOUNCES MONETARY POLICY


The governor of the RBI has announced the monetary policy for the second half
of fiscal 1997.  The policy measures are expected to increase the money supply
in the economy.  The growth rate of industrial production in April-June 1996
was lower than during the same period in the previous year.

The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), C.  Rangarajan has announced
the monetary policy for the second half of 1996-97.  The measures are expected
to increase the money supply in the Indian economy by approximately $4.3
billion.  The RBI will reduce the cash reserve ratio by 2 percentage points.
It will increase the target for export credit as a percentage of a bank's net
credit from 10% to 12% and reduce the maximum permissible interest rates for
deposits with a maturity of 30 days and upto 1 year from 11% to 10%.  In
addition, banks have been allowed to lend their foreign currency non-resident
(bank) deposits in foreign currency-denominated loans to corporations.  The
foreign exchange risk is to be borne by the borrowers.  The RBI has also
imposed a cap of 15% interest on all post-shipment rupee export credits for a
period of 90 days to 180 days.

Industrial production of 172 industries, which account for a weight of 88% in
the overall index of industrial production, registered a growth of 9.9% during
April-June 1996, compared to the same period in 1995.  This is lower than the
15.5% growth recorded in April-June 1995.  The manufacturing, mining and
electric sectors recorded a deceleration in growth in April-June 1996,
compared to the same period in 1995.  Basic goods grew by only 2% compared to
13% during the previous year.  Growth in capital goods remained at 21.1%
during April-June 1996, intermediate goods grew to 13.2% from 3.9%, consumer
durables grew by 21.1% and consumer non-durables grew by 12.2% from the same
period in 1995.

The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) is likely to revise the overall
growth rate of the Indian economy from 7%, stated in the Economic Survey
update, to about 6.3% for 1995-96.  This is primarily because of a negative
growth of 3.19% in agricultural production during fiscal 1996.

OUTLOOK

According to sources in UNESCO, infrastructure investment in India is likely
to rise from the current level of $17 billion a year to about $30 billion by
fiscal 2001.  It is estimated that the total infrastructure investment
requirement over the next 5 years will be between $115 billion and $130
billion.

NEW GUIDELINES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT ANNOUNCED


The government has announced new guidelines for foreign investment into India. 
Foreign companies will be allowed to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the 
consumer goods sector but will have to dilute their equity within a stipulated 
period. Policies on mutual funds and the privatization of coal-bed methane have
been further liberalized.

The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has stated that it will allow
foreign companies to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the consumer goods
sector.  However, these companies will have to dilute their equity and
increase the domestic equity base within a stipulated period of time.  This
divestment policy does not extend to wholly-owned subsidiaries which have
already received government approval or to those firms which have invested in
areas where technology is not locally available.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has announced a new policy for the
privatization of coal-bed methane (CBM).  The CBM projects will be taken out
of the purview of the FIPB and will be subject to international bidding with
production-sharing contracts, similar to the policy on oil and gas
exploration.  This will affect the Reliance-Texaco proposal currently pending
approval from the FIPB.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has announced that mutual
funds will get automatic clearance to launch new funds if the regulatory body
does not raise any query within 21 days of filing of offer documents.
However, fund managers will have to abide by the prevalent SEBI guidelines,
including portfolio disclosures, monthly trading reports and transactions.

The FIPB will not clear wholly-owned marketing subsidiaries in the drugs and
pharmaceuticals sector.  The only exception will be if the subsidiary
manufactures bulk drugs from the basic drug stage.

OUTLOOK

The government will announce detailed guidelines and further amendments to the
National Highway Act of 1956 during the first week of November.  Regulatory
powers are expected to be vested with the National Highways Authority of
India.

BASIC SERVICE PROVIDERS ACCEPT LETTER OF INTENT


Basic services providers, except Basic Teleservices, a joint venture between
RPG and NTT, have accepted the Letter of Intent (LOI) for operating basic
services.  As a result, Communications Minister Beni Prasad Verma has
cancelled the licence earlier awarded to Basic Teleservices and the company
will have to forfeit $14.3 million that it submitted to the Department of
Telecommunication (DoT) in the form of bank guarantees.  The deadline for
accepting the LOI and paying the licence fee was October 18, 1996.
Consortiums that did not pay the licence fees by the deadline will now be
required to pay the licence fees plus a penalty of an additional 5% above the
prime lending rate of the State Bank of India, until licence fees are paid.


Two million government employees, including approximately one million telecom,
postal and telegraph workers had gone on a nationwide strike, demanding the
government remove the eligibility ceiling for payment of bonus.  The strike,
which had paralyzed the functioning of the telecom department for a week, was
called off after the government conceded to their demands.

GOVT APPROVES COGENTRIX COUNTER-GUARANTEES 


The United Front government has approved counter-guarantees for the
Cogentrix-led Mangalore Power Company (MPC).  Cogentrix expects to obtain
financial closure within 5 months.  The government has stated that Cogentrix,
which owns a 60% stake in the 1000MW thermal project, will not be allowed to
dilute its stake below 33%.  China Light & Power owns the remaining 40%
equity.  MPC has offered Karnataka State Electricity Board 40% of the total
equity in the company.  The counter-guarantees will cover capacity and energy
charge payments for the project in the event that State Electricity Boards
(SEB) default or are unable to make payments on time.

The United Front government will grant autonomy to state governments for
approval of power projects.  The government will abolish the mandatory
clearance required from the Central Electricity Authority; state governments
will be required to set up independent regulatory authorities to address
tariff-related issues.  State governments will also be empowered to give
environmental and forest clearances.

GE'S INDIA BUSINESS STRATEGY


Scott Bayman of GE India, outlines the firm's India business strategy.

Prior to the start of liberalization GE chairman and CEO Jack Welch visited
India and liked what he experienced.  After some intensive study, GE declared
India a priority country and began a period of investing.

At a time when many companies maintained the conventional view of India -- a
country overpopulated, poor and bureaucratic; GE took a more optimistic
position.  We saw India as a country of almost 1 billion new consumers for our
products and services.  A country of very talented entrepreneurs and capable
industrialists with a highly educated, technical work force.  And a country
where English is the most common language.

We set out on a strategy of forming alliances with a common purpose.  We saw
India as the heart of a fourth pole offering profitable sales growth.  We
wanted synergistic partners for flow businesses like lighting, plastics and
appliances.  By establishing our flow businesses and broadening our role, we
hoped to leverage this expanded presence to help our project businesses such
as power generation and aircraft engines.  We wanted number one or number two
positions, or a clear plan to get there ...  taking advantage of synergies
with our businesses outside India.

We moved quickly and formed four new operating joint ventures; two green
fields; and two using existing facilities.  These alliances combined GE
Plastics with IPCL; GE Medical Systems with Wipro; GE Appliances with Godrej &
Boyce and GE Lighting with Apar.

In late 1993, GE Capital received permission for a 100% wholly owned holding
company.  Using this as a platform, we formed a joint venture with HDFC called
Countrywide Consumer Financial Services which provided personal financing to
the hundreds of thousands of Indian consumers purchasing TV's, stereos,
appliances and other consumer durables.  Countrywide in turn, is forming joint
ventures with companies like Maruti to offer private label financing.  GE
Capital India also offers a range of services including equipment leasing and
financing, working capital loans, export finance, project finance and
strategic investment.  It is also involved with GE Power systems in the
development of independent power plants and other infrastructure projects.

From this beginning, we have added joint ventures in motors, medical systems
and information services.  Earlier this year, we began a 100 per cent owned
silicones business.  In addition, we are forming joint ventures to provide
services, overhaul and repair for the industrial and power generation
aftermarket.

Our big ticket items such as locomotives, aircraft engines, gas and steam
turbines and aero derivative engines are supported through licenses such as
BHEL and liaison offices.

As you can see, GE does not follow a standard, one dimensional approach.  We
like partners and have a large number of joint ventures around the world.
Whether or not a specific business is a joint venture of wholly owned
subsidiary, is driven by the local market, the availability of strong,
potential partners and local regulations.

Our country priorities for India are clear.  The top priority for each
business is to strengthen its growth strategies to widen leads over
competitors or to gain the number one share position.  Part of our plan is to
look back to what GE did to build its global positions, and bring these
lessons to India.

Our strategy in India is and has been to choose strong partners each of whom
bring value to the venture.  This value add may be in the form of strong brand
and distribution; or management talent and people resources; or existing
manufacturing capabilities in more mature industries; or the know how to build
factories and develop markets for newer industries.  Most important, our
partners share our values; our passion for growth and each has the highest
integrity.  These added values we look for from our partners are far more
important to us than investment dollars.

Ownership structures may change over time for a variety of reasons including
one or the other partner not wishing to continue to invest in the business, or
wishing to divest in order to invest in other more strategic opportunities.

Our strategy is to continue to staff our businesses with Indians.  Currently,
all but one of our businesses is led by either a local national or a
Nonresident Indian.  GE expatriates are here for their expertise and unique
knowledge of GE's products, services or management practices.  We anticipate
the number of expats will decrease over time.

Some of our businesses are fortunate to have joined hands with strong local
brands.  It is our strong desire to grow these brands while introducing the GE
brand for incremental sales, often in different market segments or with
different product positioning.

We are bringing the latest technologies and products to India such as ribbon
processing to lighting, compounding process for our world leading Lexan
plastic and the latest GE Profile refrigerators and washing machines designed
for international standards and climates.  Wipro-GE Medical Systems in
Bangalore had the exclusive design responsibility and is the supplier for all
global requirements for our latest ultra sound diagnostic product.

Our strategy is to bring GE's management know-how to India.  We hold two best 
practices sharing sessions each year with all the businesses where we exchange 
ideas and lessons and importantly, talk about how to adapt these to the Indian 
Market.  Our partners frequently send teams from their other businesses to 
participate.

A big focus of our cross business synergy is people development.  In 1995, we
trained over 900 managers, and this year, we will exceed 1000.  The courses
are the same as those developed and taught at Crotonville, our management
development center in the U.S.  Again, our partners' other businesses
frequently participate.

We have implemented GE's early leadership development programs for technical,
finance, information management and human resource specialists.  These
programs are available to all the businesses in India, and we currently have
124 participants.
