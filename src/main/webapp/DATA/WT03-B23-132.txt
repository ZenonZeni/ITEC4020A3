For over a decade, Tucker Anthony has been helping clients access the expertise of professional
investment managers through various investment management programs.
To help you gain a better understanding of the subject matter,
we'll discuss the following topics:

<P>
At some point it's possible that your investment
portfolio may become large enough and complicated enough that
you may need some help in managing it. For many investors, the
answer has been to seek professional help by either investing
in <A HREF="mutual.htm">Mutual Funds</A>
or by hiring a professional investment
manager. The method you choose depends largely on the size of
your financial assets. Mutual funds generally accept a minimum
investment of $1,000, while an individually managed account requires
a minimum investment of $100,000. The big difference in minimum
investment levels is due to the amount of personalized service
provided. Where a mutual fund is managed by pooling the
assets of many investors, an individually managed account will
structure a portfolio that meets your specific investment needs
and risk tolerance. 

<P>
Previously available only to very large institutional
clients, such as pension plans, endowments, foundations, and Taft-Hartley
clients, personalized money management is now available to the
smaller investor as well.
