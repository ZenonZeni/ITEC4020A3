<H1>Short opinion of the NIST GAK meeting</H1>
The Clinton Administration is revising parts of the ill-advised and 
ill fated Clipper initiative. The key action was a two day long
meeting on key escrow and export regulations that took place
September 6 and 7, 1995. 
<p>
It is my belief that this meeting was a staged presentation. 
Nearly every industry representative said that this was a fatally flawed
idea. It was "a non-starter." The government
representatives said that they heard the comments, but insisted
on proceeding.
<p>
It is clear to me that the government intends that industry provide crippled
encryption "for export." Never stated was the expectation that since
industry has repeatedly said that they want only one version worldwide 
of products, that Domestic products will be crippled. The testimony
of  Geoff Greiveldinger (from the US Justice Department) was focused
on domestic crime -- if the meeting was about export, why the focus
on domestic areas?
<p>
It is equally clear from representatives of IBM, Compaq, DEC, Lotus, and
others that I talked to, that crypto product development will
simply move offshore. Ireland, Israel, and Germany already have
significant experience in developing commercial software.
<p> 
It is depressing to hear our Commerce department chasing technology and
jobs overseas.
<p>
I believe that strong encryption is necessary for security, privacy, and
authentication for client/server systems. It wasn't 
needed for mainframe systems.
It is critical for client/server systems. But todate, few client/server systems
are operational, and those have only modest size. As a result,
the need for security, privacy, and authentication is not
recognized by the purchasers of software systems. It will take some
public failures before the need is recognized and accepted. With the
policies that the Clinton Administration is pushing onto a very 
reluctant industry, the development of these critical tools 
will occur outside the US.
