<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
High concentrations of lead and other heavy metals in soils can pose a threat to human health.  Currently, soil samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory for heavy metals by atomic absorption spectroscopy and/or inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy.  This requires sizable expenditures of time and funds.  Hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrum analyzers have been developed for detecting lead and other heavy metals in paint.  Further development of these units offers a potentially fast and inexpensive method of determining levels of lead and other heavy-metal contamination in soils.
<P>
Being able to take a hundred readings a day and having the data available immediately are the major benefits of portable XRF units.  Ordinarily, one would have to wait weeks for a laboratory to report analytical results.  With a small portable unit, a researcher can quickly determine the scope of lead contamination and then use laboratory results to verify field measurements.

<B>Argonne scientists are evaluating a hand-held X-ray fluorescence spectrum analyzer as a quick, convient, and inexpensive way of measuring concentrations of lead and other heavy metals in soils.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
XRF units also reduce costs.  A laboratory analysis for lead and other heavy metals may cost $200-300 for each soil sample.  With portable XRF units, a large number of readings can be made at greatly reduced cost.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
At Grafenwöhr Training Area, a U.S. Army installation in southern Germany, Argonne National Laboratory researchers investigated small arms firing ranges for lead contamination in soils.  
<P>
A hand-held XRF unit was used to measure lead concentrations in soils in potentially contaminated areas.  Ranges devoted to rifle, pistol, and hand grenade practice were included in the study.  Readings taken on the rifle range indicated the highest level of lead in the surface soil.  At only a few centimeters beneath the surface, however, lead could no longer be detected.  At the pistol range, readings showed lower concentrations of lead than at the rifle range.  This is consistent with the fact that rifle slugs disintegrate on impact into small particles that are more easily incorporated into the soil.  Pistol slugs, on the other hand, remain intact on impact.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
XRF field readings of lead contamination were confirmed by laboratory analysis.  With few exceptions, relative standard deviation was in the 8-10% range, which is very acceptable precision for a field-screening method.  The exceptions may reflect the heterogeneity of fine lead particles in soils and the fact that XRF has a bias toward low values for soils with high lead concentrations.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
This technology has advanced to the point where it can be used for other heavy metals besides lead.  Argonne researchers are looking for opportunities to expand their investigations to other heavy metals and to determine the influence of soil texture and moisture conditions on this field-screening method.
