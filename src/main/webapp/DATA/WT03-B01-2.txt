HANDBOOK URGES JAPANESE COMPANIES TO GET INVOLVED

     Corporate giving and volunteerism are significant elements
of life in the United States that the Japanese community must
come to terms with, says a handbook published by New York's
Japanese Chamber of Commerce.
     Published with Japanese and English text on facing pages,
the book is titled Joining In! A Handbook for Better Corporate
Citizenship in the United States.  Its 85 pages contain advice to
Japan-based companies in America on how to participate
effectively in communities where they have built plants, by
supporting local charities and volunteering to work for local
organizations.
     In the preface, Hisao Kondo, president of the Japanese
Chamber of Commerce, emphasizes that Joining In! was not written
just to expand Japanese understanding of American philanthropy,
but as a "call to action."  As such, it urges Japanese executives
in the United States to take the initiative in getting involved
in their communities without waiting to be asked.
     "This is a vital means of gaining acceptance and thereby
improving American community perception of the Japanese
transplant company," says the handbook.  It emphasizes that
community involvement can promote a Japanese corporation's
business interests in several ways:
     o  by improving its ability to recruit and retain skilled
local employees;

     o  by fostering good working relationships with local and
state government officials;

     o  by providing tax deductions; and

     o  by improving the company's image.
     Language and cultural barriers have prevented many Japanese
executives from joining boards and volunteering for other
community activities, according to the handbook.  One result of
this is that some Japanese-based corporations have suffered from
the image of being uninvolved.
     To change this perception, the handbook recommends that
Japanese corporations take a number of steps toward becoming more
involved in their local communities:

     o  Establish a company policy on volunteering and community
involvement, after first seeking suggestions from all employees.

     o  Create a program budget.

     o  Appoint a community involvement coordinator who, ideally,
should be Japanese; alternatively, a Japanese and an American
could be joint coordinators.

     o  Select an initial project for special attention and
publicize it in the company and community.

     o  Recognize and reward volunteerism by employees.
     "Volunteer programs are a way for corporations to
demonstrate moral leadership, `doing the right thing,' which
comes back to benefit the company by enhancing its image and its
influence in the community," says the handbook.  "Community
involvement and volunteer programs are ultimately good for
business."
     Next month CGW will look at areas in the United States where
Japanese companies have a strong presence for an overview of
their giving policies.
     Joining In! is available for $40 from the Japanese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry of New York, The Galleria, 115 East 57th
Street, New York, NY 10022.

REEBOK TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT RACISM

     Three recent grants by the Reebok Foundation illustrate the
athletic shoe manufacturer's long-term commitment to human
rights.
     The largest gift, $750,000, went to the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, for a
program to combat racism.
     The three-year program, called "Project Teamwork," plans to
send teams of athletes to schools and community groups around the
country, starting this summer.  Four cities, Boston, Los Angeles,
New York, and Washington, DC, will be targeted in the first year.
     The founders of the project say it is necessary because they
feel civil rights progress has slowed and that racism and
anti-Semitism are on the rise.  They believe athletes are key to
the program's success because athletes are among the strongest
black role models.
     Project Teamwork will also include elements of a program
started five years ago to help former college athletes who failed
to get their degrees after their athletic eligibility expired.
  In the schools and community centers they visit, the
athletes will talk about the dangers of racism, the value of
staying in school, and the fallacy of going through school with
the idea of making a career of professional athletics.
     Reebok also announced a $375,000 grant to TransAfrica, as
part of a campaign to discredit rumors that Reebok International
does business in South Africa.  (Reebok stopped selling its
products in South Africa in 1976.)
     The grant will help build TransAfricare's new library and
research center in Washington, DC.  When completed, the center
will be the primary resource for historical and educational
materials on the role of African Americans in the shaping of U.S.
foreign policy.
     A third grant, for $50,000, went to the NAACP for the
general fund of the civil rights group.
     The grants exemplify Reebok's long-term commitment to the
cause of human rights, says Paul Fireman, chairman and CEO of the
company.  The foundation is also interested in supporting "the
underserved" children and youth, the handicapped, and the
elderly.  It also occasionally assists capital campaigns or
building projects "where the result would make a world of
difference in the lifestyle of the people served," according to
foundation guidelines.
     Reebok's total contributions in 1987 were $285,500,
increasing to $1.5 million in 1988.  The foundation accepts
proposals year-round; the contact person is Jean Mahoney,
executive director, Reebok Foundation, 150 Royall Street, Canton,
MA 02021, (617) 341-7361.

     Look for possible enhancement of Dayton Hudson's charitable

     Look for possible enhancement of Dayton Hudson's charitable
giving policies since the corporation's $1.04 billion acquisition
of Marshall Field's, announced in April.  Marshall Field's 24
stores, located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, and Ohio, will
bring Dayton Hudson's total number of department stores to 61.
It is too soon to speculate on changes in corporate giving, a
Dayton Hudson spokesman said, "but if the merger is successful,
Marshall Field's will become a part of our culture, and the
foundation is a big part of that culture."  The Dayton Hudson
Foundation gave $17.4 million in 1988, chiefly to the arts and
humanities and social services.  Cynthia Mayeda was recently
named director of the foundation (CGW, April).

     Adele D. Hazel, 60, a newly licensed real estate agent in
Annandale, VA, has established a fund to which real estate
agents, brokers, and others can donate money to help house the
homeless.  She has pledged to donate to the fund all commissions
she receives from selling houses.  Hazel joined Pyon Realty in
Annandale in March and has already persuaded two agents there to
donate part of their commissions to the fund.  "There's been more
talk than action on solving the plight of the homeless," Hazel
said.

     Street News, a bi-weekly tabloid in New York whose motto is
"Helping America's Hungry," is being sold by a homeless sales
force recruited from shelters and the benches of Grand Central
Station.  The hawkers keep $.50 of each $.75 sale, earning up to
$250 a week.  Street News was launched with significant corporate
support.  Its office and warehouse space are donated by real
estate companies; AT&T/Bell Labs contributed the computers;
Stratocom, the office machines; and businesses such as Ben &
Jerry's ice cream underwrite a page of job-training listings.  Ad
agencies and corporations have bought full-page ads (at $3,500)
to help the newspaper cover its costs.  Future plans are for
Street News to hit the streets of Washington, DC, San Francisco,
CA, Newark, NJ, and Philadelphia, PA.

     According to a new independent survey commissioned by Save
the Children, 84% of all heads of companies polled feel that
children's education is a world problem of extreme or great
importance, even more than pollution, energy shortages, and
disease.  More than half (58%) of the business executives polled
think that corporations should participate in charity-sponsored
efforts to help disadvantaged children worldwide.  According to
the survey findings, the three most important factors when
considering a corporate contribution to a charity are geographic
areas served, cited by 77%; concrete results, cited by 76%; and
the percentage of revenues spent on administration, cited by 69%.

PRUDENTIAL FUNDS HEALTH CARE FOR URBAN YOUTH

     In response to health care delivery gaps and high infant
mortality rates in its corporate office host city of Newark, NJ,
the Prudential Foundation will fund two initiatives that will
increase access to medical and social programs for the city's
children.
     The school-based initiative, "Cities in Schools," (CIS) will
offer an array of on-site social services to 135 students who
attend Newark's Central High School, where the dropout rate is 22
percent. Services will include medical and dental care, pre- and
post-natal care, academic counseling, and job training.
     CIS, which received $100,000 from the Prudential Foundation,
is supported nationally by private-sector funding and the federal
Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments. If
successful, the program may be replicated in Newark's four other
high schools.
     The foundation also gave the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey $65,000 to support a mobile pediatric
health clinic that will make house calls to children in Newark's
low-income housing projects. About 100 children a week will visit
the unit.
     The two grants are among $4.5 million the foundation
allocated to health care and education programs in 1990.
     "The projects are classic examples of how addressing the
needs of particular populations and communities can have larger
implications for society and business," said Prudential
Foundation president Peter Goldberg.

THE PRUDENTIAL: HOW MUCH THEY GIVE, WHERE IT GOES

     The Foundation gave $14.3 million in 1989 and $13.34 million
in 1989.  The company's direct giving in 1988 totaled about $1.74
million, which does not include non-monetary support of $252,000.
     Primary concerns are improving basic education skills,
including math, science, language arts, and computer literacy in
public schools, and supporting increased educational
opportunities for the disadvantaged, minorities, women, and
disabled people.  Health care is also a priority.
     A number of education contributions are disbursed as
employee matching gifts to colleges and universities, private
secondary schools, and schools for people with disabilities.
Contact: Elisa D. Pazzuoli, Secretary, Prudential
Foundation, Prudential Plaza, 745 Broad Street, 15th Floor,
Newark, NJ 07101.  Requests for nonmonetary support should be
addressed to William E. Brooks, Vice President, Community
Relations.

D.C. SCHOOL BOARD ACCEPTS $1 MILLION FROM PHILIP MORRIS

     The Washington, DC, school board recently approved a $1
million grant from the Philip Morris tobacco conglomerate,
overturning its original decision to delay acceptance of the
money because of "moral" concerns.
     The uncertainty about whether or not to accept the grant
highlights the concerns that school systems in cities with large
minority populations have in accepting gifts from tobacco
companies.  There is growing anger locally about industry tactics
to promote a product linked to about 900 deaths a year in the
District, a rate that far exceeds the national average.
     But company officials say the criticism would be worse and
more deserved if they failed to share their wealth.  "If we gave
$1 million to Mother Teresa, critics would find something wrong
with it," said Tom Ricke, Philip Morris spokesman.  "We do it
because it's the right thing to do."
     The grant will help finance learning centers at several city
schools chosen as sites for a school-improvement model created by
Yale University child psychiatrist James P. Comer.

CORPORATE SUPPORT OF READING PROGRAMS EXPANDS

     Encouraging children to read is one of corporate America's
favorite ways of disbursing charitable funds.  There is a double
payoff: reading programs address companies' own needs for
literate employees and also enhance their public image.
     Jello Desserts, a division of General Foods Corporation,
which began its Reading Rocket program two years ago in ten city
school systems, will offer the program nationally in 1990-91.
 Launched with a grant of $2.5 million, Reading Rocket is aimed
at children in grades 2-4 and addresses three major
concerns: motivating children to enjoy reading, encouraging
parental participation, and providing teachers and librarians
with additional books.
     Another successful program, Pizza Hut's "Book It!" was
started five years ago to encourage children in grades 1-6 to
read more by rewarding them with pizza vouchers.  This program
has proved so popular that in 1990-91 it will be offered to
children in kindergarten, too.  Because many kindergartners
cannot read, teachers will set reading goals that involve
parents, grandparents, and siblings in reading to the child.
Steven S. Reinemund, president and CEO of Pizza Hut, a division
of Pepsico, explains his company's motivation for the project:
"As an employer, we believe an investment in education is an
investment in our future."
     Currently the company's annual budget for literacy
initiatives is $20 million.
     Contact: Eunice Ellis, Pizza Hut, Inc., P.O. Box 2999,
Wichita, KS 67201.
     Early childhood education is also a priority of the General
Foods Corporation, which merged with Kraft in 1988.  Before the
merger, General Foods gave about $10 million annually.  Contact:
Ronald J. Coman, administrative director, Kraft General Foods
Foundation, Glenview, IL 60025.

CAUSE-RELATED MARKETING: SIX TIPS FOR SUCCESS

     The word is out that corporations can sell products, make
money, and do good at the same time through a well thought out
cause-marketing campaign, William H. Lembeck, president of Ryan
Cause Marketing, a consulting company in Westport, CT, told an
international conference of the National Society of Fund Raising
Executives in Orlando, FL, in March.
     But a lot of nonprofit organizations don't understand the
needs of corporations or how they go about marketing their
products, and therefore miss out on this "huge pot of money,"
Lembeck noted.
     Here are Lembeck's six tips for nonprofits who want to reap
the benefits of cause-related marketing:

     o  Think like a marketer.  Identify your organization's
marketable assets.  These may include your name, community
awareness of your programs, and your board members.

     o  Learn as much as you can about the companies you wish to
approach.  Read the business press; check the companies' annual
reports; watch their ads and promotions.

     o  Try to figure out what their target is before you
approach them.

     o  Address their needs in your presentation; show them that
you're on their side and that working with your organization will
help them sell more products (and incidentally benefit your
cause).

     o  Identify key decision makers.  For cause-marketing
decisions, the person to approach is not the head of the
foundation, it's the vice president of marketing and sales.
o  Follow up a proposal personally by phone and in letters until
you get an answer.

     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holders

     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holders
overwhelmingly turned down a proposal that sought to ban
corporate funding for organizations endorsing abortion.  The vote
followed the AT&T Foundation's decision to cut off donations to
Planned Parenthood because of complaints from anti-abortionists.
In a letter to Robert E. Allen, chairman of the board and CEO of
AT&T, Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, said that
the company's actions, "have damaged corporate philanthropy in
general.  You have demonstrated that a small band of zealots can
successfully harass a major corporation."  Wattleton's letter,
written before the shareholders' meeting, pointed out that AT&T
management advised share-holders to vote against the proposal,
"an enlightened position now undercut by the foundation."

     Earth Day organizers raised about $2.5 million to celebrate
its 20th anniversary in April.  Among corporate donors that met
Earth Day's strict environmental standards were Esprit clothing
company; Shaklee, which manufactures biodegradable and
phosphate-free detergents; and Church & Dwight, which makes Arm &
Hammer products.  Organizers say they turned away $4 million from
corporations that did not meet their exacting standards.  But
being rejected as sponsors of Earth Day has not prevented
companies such as GM, AT&T, Mobil, Shell Oil, and Dow Chemical
from latching onto the environment as a marketing gimmick in
their advertising.  Ad executives predict consumer backlash.
The Soviet national airline, Aeroflot, has agreed to buy jet
engines from General Electric Co., the first time Western-made
commercial aircraft engines have been sold to the Soviet Union.
GE said the sale could be worth as much as $150 million and opens
the door to further sales to the Soviet airline, the world's
largest.  The purchase comes on top of $131 million in orders
from state-owned airlines in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and
Poland.

TAFT'S "NONPROFIT COMPUTER SOURCEBOOK" IS USER FRIENDLY

     How best to use computers in the non-profit workplace is the
subject of Taft's newest publication, "Nonprofit Computer
Sourcebook".
     Edited by Alex Norsworthy, director of development at
Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, the book
presents a basic outline of the steps and the pitfalls involved
in selecting and maintaining an information system, followed by a
comprehensive and current list of computer information sources
and services.
     "NCS" includes a listing of computer software of particular
interest to non-profit organizations, ranging from
"A1-Fundraiser," a system that tracks biographical and financial
information on constituents, to "ZDS," which tracks, among other
things, donor gifts and pledges, major gifts and grants, and
special events and ticket sales.

Taft Group, 12300 Twinbrook Parkway, Suite 450, Rockville, MD

BURGER KING COOKS UP WAYS TO HELP KIDS STAY IN SCHOOL

     To help combat the nation's chronic school dropout rate,
Burger King has opened Burger King Academies in seven cities;
three more will be announced in September.
     The academies, run by the dropout-prevention organization
Cities in Schools, offer academic instruction to dropout-prone
high school students, along with counseling, job training, and
access to social services such as child care and public
assistance.
     The U.S. Department of Justice helped launch the project
with a $1 million grant.  Burger King added $350,000 seed money,
plus $45,000 a year per academy for budget expenses.
     Academies are located in Long Beach, Inglewood, and
Sacramento, CA; San Antonio, TX; Palm Beach and Miami, FL; and
Philadelphia, PA.
     Contact: Gina Craig, Director, Corporate Affairs, Burger
King Corp., P.O. Box 520783, Miami, FL 33152.
