Expanding Access to Asylum</h2>

<ul>


<p>

Since 1994, when the US recognized persecution because of

homosexuality as grounds for asylum, some 60 foreigners have been given asylum

in the US on that basis.  US interest groups have lobbied to extend asylum

eligibility to women trying to escape forcible subjugation at the hands of

male-dominated Islamic societies and to Chinese men and women who oppose their

government's one-child-per-family policy.<p>

In October 1995, a New York immigration judge granted asylum to a

heterosexual man from Togo on the grounds of his HIV infection and AIDS-related

illnesses.  The man entered the US in April 1991, applied for political asylum

and was rejected and then applied for asylum claiming persecution as a member

of a "particular social group"-- HIV-infected persons in Togo and the Ivory

Coast.  An HIV-positive man from Brazil was granted asylum by an immigration

judge in San Francisco in August, 1996.<p>

In January 1996, a presidential commission recommended that HIV infection

be made a basis for asylum in the US.  However, a 1993 law specifically bars

aliens with HIV or AIDS from entering the United States.  Rep. Lamar S. Smith

(R-TX), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, says that

granting asylum based on homosexuality, as some immigration judges have been

doing, is "stretching the law."  Granting asylum on the basis of HIV infection

is, according to Smith, "a violation of the law."<p>

A Russian lesbian is asking a federal appeals court to grant her asylum in

the US, claiming that she faces institutionalization and electroshock therapy

if she returns home.  According to her lawyer, this is the first time a federal

appeals court will consider sexual orientation as a basis for asylum.<p>

Other countries that grant asylum based on sexual orientation include:

Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Belgium, Finland, Great

Britain and Netherlands.  <p>

The 1996 immigration law includes a provision that permits up to 1,000

persons each year to be accepted as refugees because their country restricted

their child-bearing rights in the name of  population control.  Most of the 282

Chinese on the Golden Venture, which ran aground in New York Harbor on June 6,

1993, requested political asylum based on fear of forced abortion or

sterilization.  As of December 1996, 99 of those on the Golden Venture have

been returned to China, 60 are being detained, 38 are free on bond, 35 were

granted asylum, 14 minors were released to US relatives, 12 emigrated and the

others escaped or disappeared.<p>

An Armenian women persecuted for practicing transcendental meditation in

Armenia was granted asylum in the US.<p>

Refugees are screened outside the US to determine if they are persecuted in

such a way that they should be brought to the US for protection.  The number

admitted to the US each year is negotiated annually by the President and

Congress.  Asylum applicants are a self-selected group; their number depends on

how many foreigners already inside the US borders request protection and get

it.<p>

The Geneva Convention obliges signatories to protect persons fleeing

"persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race,

religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political

opinion."<p>

In Florida, the INS announced that 14 Cubans who arrived in Key West by

boat would be returned to Cuba.  Since May 1996, Cubans intercepted at sea have

been returned to Cuba, but those who made it to the US were allowed to stay

until the new INS policy went into effect on December 5, 1996.  Under the new

policy, Cubans who reach the US will be returned if the Cuban government

accepts their return.<p>

In December, the US flew to Guam 5,000 Kurds and their families who had

worked with US aid agencies in northern Iraq.  They are to eventually arrive in

the US.  The US has already evacuated 2,700 Iraqis and Kurds who worked

directly or indirectly for the US government.<p>

Britain and other European countries have refused to allow immigration by

Iraqis associated with their aid programs.<p>

On December 25, 1996, Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan announced

that Turkey was ending its involvement in the US-orchestrated effort to assist

Kurds in northern Iraq known as "Operation Provide Comfort."  Over US

objections, Turkey and Iran signed trade agreements meant to double the volume

of trade between Turkey and Iran to $2 billion per year.<p>

December 26, 1996. "Cubans Reaching U.S. Illegally Will Now Be Sent Back to

Island," Reuters, December 24, 1996.  William Branigin, "More Than 60

Homosexuals Claiming Persecution Have Been Granted Asylum in US," Washington
