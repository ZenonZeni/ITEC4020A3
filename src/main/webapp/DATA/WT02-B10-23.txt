Anipryl&#174; Distribution Agreement</b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><i>Veterinary Pharmaceutical
Shipments to Canada to Start Mid-February</i></font></p>
<p>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, JANUARY 11, 1996 -- Deprenyl Animal
Health, Inc. (NASDAQ-BB: DAHI; TSE: DAH) has completed its
agreement with Draxis Health Inc. (NASDAQ: DRAXF; TSE: DAX) to
distribute DAHI's recently-approved veterinary drug
Anipryl&#174;(l-selegiline) in Canada. </p>
<p>As part of the 10-year exclusive distribution agreement,
originally announced last month, Draxis has paid an upfront fee
of approximately US$469,000 for specified Canadian rights to
Anipryl&#174;, as well as US$125,000 for reimbursement of
expenses incurred to date to prepare marketing materials for the
Canadian launch of Anipryl&#174;. The companies entered into a
revenue-sharing formula for Canadian sales of Anipryl&#174;. </p>
<p>DAHI has completed a training program for Draxis' sales
representatives and expects that the first shipments of
Anipryl&#174; will be delivered to Draxis' warehouses by
mid-February. </p>
<p>Draxis will operate a sales force that will market
Anipryl&#174; to Canada's veterinary market, and has retained a
marketing director whose sole responsibility will be for animal
products. DAHI will manufacture Anipryl&#174; and will operate a
technical support center, staffed by veterinarians, to assure
quality control and assist clinical veterinarians in Canada. </p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased to take this important step in moving
DAHI from a pure research company to a veterinary pharmaceutical
manufacturing and marketing company,&quot; said David R. Stevens,
President and Chief Executive Officer of DAHI. &quot;The Canadian
market acceptance of Anipryl&#174; may serve as an indicator of
the North American potential for this pharmaceutical.&quot; </p>
<p>DAHI is evaluating its options for distribution of
Anipryl&#174; in the U.S., including negotiating with several
companies to establish a marketing alliance. Marketing rights in
selected European markets have been acquired by Hoechst
Veterinae, which is conducting clinical trials. </p>
<p>Anipryl&#174; was approved for sale in Canada for canine
Cushing's disease, which affects approximately 15,000 older dogs
in the country each year. Anipryl improves the quality of life of
older dogs, often delaying the decision by pet owners to put
their companion animal to sleep. </p>
<p>DAHI recently submitted a New Animal Drug Application with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market Anipryl&#174; in the
U.S., where there are approximately 150,000 new cases of canine
Cushing's disease annually. </p>
<p>DAHI is also conducting Phase III-equivalent trials to obtain
approval to market Anipryl&#174; for cognitive dysfunction.
Approximately 150,000 older dogs in Canada, and 1.5 million older
dogs in the U.S. are diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction each
year. </p>
<p>As part of the distribution agreement, Draxis will convert
approximately US$1.5 million of the US$3 million in loans
outstanding into DAHI shares at CDN$2.11 per share or US$1.55.
Draxis Health will also provide US$1 million of additional
operating capital in the form of a loan convertible to DAHI
common shares at the rate of CDN$2.11 per share or US$1.55.
Except for the conversion rates, the new loan is subject to the
same general terms and conditions as the existing loans. Based on
the terms of the distribution agreement, DAHI anticipates that it
will meet its operating capital needs for 1996. </p>
<p>As a result of the conversion, Draxis will own approximately
43 percent of the shares of DAHI, and its ownership could
increase to approximately 52 percent of DAHI, on a non-diluted
basis, through the conversion of all of the loans outstanding. </p>
<p>Draxis is a marketing and research company that operates
Canadian neurological and dermatological pharmaceutical
divisions, a U.S. consumer marketing company, and offers products
exclusively through U.S. podiatrists. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health was established in 1990 to develop
animal health applications for Anipryl&#174;. The Company is also
identifying other animal health product opportunities to become a
multi-product animal health pharmaceutical company. </p>
