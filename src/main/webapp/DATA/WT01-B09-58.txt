<B>Project Title: Polymer MultiLayer Capacitors and Batteries  <p>

Performing Organization: Sigma Labs, Inc. <p></B>

Technical POC: Ted Miller<br>

Phone: (520) 575-8013 <br>

Fax: (520) 742-0975 <p>

<B>Project Summary:</B><p>

Sigma Labs' PML technology is progressing toward the production of extremely
high performance energy storage devices. PML refers to a production process and type of material
consisting of multilayers of polymer and metal (typically 1 M/layer). The composition of both the
polymers and the metals can be tailored for specific applications. We are targeting two devices in this
project; a high energy density electrostatic capacitor, and an ultra thin film lithium battery.  <p>

Capacitor <p>

ML capacitors are constructed with multilayered polymer dielectrics and thin film metal electrodes.
The short term energy density goal is 1 Wh/kg. The long term energy density goal is 20 Wh/kg. The
long term power density goal is 1 MW/kg. By virtue of discharge times on the order of microseconds,
we have already achieved 5 MW/kg discharges in lab experiments.<p>

Battery <p>

Lithium battery electrochemistry is being develCapacitor Poped with thin film polymer and
polymercomposite battery components that are PML compatible. The unique PML processing can
exploit thin film geometry on a bulk materials scale that cannot be achieved with any other materials
production technique. A direct consequence is extraordinarily high power density. While the project
goals are 400 W/kg, a much higher power density is expected without loss of energy density. The
project energy density goal is 200 Wh/kg.<p>

<B>Project Deliverables:</B> <p> Deliverables are best effort devices targeting the goals described above. 

The capacitors will be multilayerdevices. The batteries will be single cell thin film devices made with
PML compatible materials. <p>

<B>Project Schedule:</B> <p><ul><li> The project was initiated in June 1995 and will conclude June 1997.</ul>
