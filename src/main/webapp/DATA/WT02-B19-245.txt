<ul>
<li> <i>School-To-Work Components That Predict Postschool Success for Students with and Without
Disabilities</i><br>
Michael R. Benz, Paul Yovanoff, and Bonnie Doren<br>
Student and parents interviews for students with and without disabilities provided general 
support for the school-based and work-based instructional components envisioned as part of 
comprehensive school-to-work programs.<p>

<li><i>Strategy Instruction in Planning: Effects on the Writing Performance and Behavior of Students with Learning Difficulties</i><br>
Susan De La Paz and Steve Graham<br> 
Following instruction on a retrieve and write strategy, students wrote essays that were longer, provided more support for their premise, and were qualitatively better.<p>

<li><i>Importance of Social Support in the Adjustment of Children with Learning Problems</I><br>
Melodie Wenz-Gross and Gary N. Siperstein<br>
Although 4th through 6th grade children with and without learning problems did not differ on the size or composition of their social networks, or on the negative features of friendships, children with learning problems used their network differently for support.<p>

<li><i>Collaborative Problem-Solving to Promote the Inclusion of Young Children with Significant  Disabilities in Primary Grades</I><br>
Christine L. Salisbury, Ian M. Evans, and Mary M. Palombaro<br>
A collaborative problem solving process was found to be implemented appropriately and to be viewed positively by teachers, as well as to promote outcomes valued by district stakeholders.<p>

<li><i>Family Perspectives on Inclusive Lifestyle Issues for People with Problem Behavior</I>Ann P. Turnbull and Mike Ruef<br>
Interviews with families of children, youth, and adults with problem behavior suggest extremely scant and tenuous inclusive life-style supports for these individuals and their families.<p>

<li><i>Promoting Interactions Among Preschoolers with and Without Disabilities: Effects of a Buddy Skills-Training Program</I><br>
Kris English, Howard Goldstein, Karin Shafer and Louise Kaczmarek<br>
Increases in interactions among preschoolers with and without disabilities following training support the benefits of peer training for promoting peer interactions, considered a prerequisite for the development of friendships in integrated preschools.<p>

<li><i>Self-Determination and Positive Adult Outcomes: A Follow-Up Study of Youth with Mental Retardation or Learning Disabilities</i><br>
Michael Wehmeyer and Michelle Schwartz<br>
Students who have high self-determination ratings before leaving high school were found to have achieved several more positive adult outcomes than their peers who lower self determination ratings.<p>

<li><i>Styles of Thinking, Abilities, and Academic Performance</i><br>
Elena Grigorenko and Robert J. Sternberg<br>
Thinking styles were found to play a significant role in the academic performance of gifted students, with equally able thinkers of different styles performing better in different assessment settings.<p>

<li><i>Characteristics and Practices of Sign Language Interpreters in Inclusive Education Programs</i><br>
Bernhardt E. Jones, Gary M. Clark, and Donald F. Soltz<br>
Information on educational sign language interpreters in the K-12 public school system raises several questions about the dependence of students who are deaf or hard of hearing on the educational interpreter support system.<p>

<li><i>Becoming Architects of Communities of Learning: Addressing Academic Diversity in Contemporary Classrooms</i><br>
Carol Ann Tomlinson, Carolyn M. Callahan, Ellen M. Tomchin, Nancy Eiss, Marcia Imbeau and Mary Landrum<br>
The preservice experiences of novice teachers suggest several guidelines for expanding the acceptance of diversity and differentiating instruction for academically diverse learners.</ul>
