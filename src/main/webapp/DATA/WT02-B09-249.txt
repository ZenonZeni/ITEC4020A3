<H4><u>Self-Advocacy</u></H4>
Growing into young adulthood presents challenges of coping with many issues and 
problems. Solving these issues and problems by being your own advocate is intervening
to influence the adversity.
<br>
<br>
Self-advocacy is a specific action and a process.  Thre is an adage which best describes this principle: give a fish to a hungry person and you will temporarily alleviate hunger; teach a hungry person to fish and you can help permanently alleviate the hnuger.  Alleviation of the hunger is the product or action of this intervention.  Teaching the hungry person to fish is the process.
<br>
<br>
Your needs are met by being informed of the resources available in your community.

Take personal responsibility for your own circumstances, recognize the causes and consequences of the problem, and develop the skills and knowledge edge necessary to approach and resolve these problems.
<br>
<br>
