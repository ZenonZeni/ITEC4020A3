<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Maine is the nation's third-leading

producer of broccoli, after California and Arizona, harvesting

about 5,000 acres each year and making broccoli third in importance

in the state's produce industry, after potatoes and blueberries.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Maine's two major broccoli producers

import 300 harvesters from Texas and California, and they offer

them housing at no cost.  The workers share a group piecerate,

and some crews reportedly average $400 to $500 per worker per

week.  Broccoli production began in Aroostook County in 1981.

 One grower, Maine Packers, employs 200 workers (plus families)

to harvest 3,200 acres of broccoli.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Nationally, there were 11 million

hundredweight of broccoli produced from 104,000 acres in 1995,

valued at $341 million, including $15 million worth in Maine.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US Department of Labor fined

the DeCoster Egg Farms $3.6 million on July 12, 1996 for alleged

safety and health violations at its Turner, Maine facility.  DeCoster

is the largest producer of brown eggs in the US, employing 800

workers in three states, including 320 at the Maine farm.  Poor

working conditions lead to the hiring of 750 to 800 workers each

year to keep the Maine farm staffed.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">DeCoster has annual revenues of

more than $40 million and produces about 23 million eggs each

week.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">DOL charged that DeCoster operated

an unsanitary and dangerous workplace and provided &quot;inhumane

living quarters&quot; consisting of filthy and cramped trailers

to workers.  The most serious violations included unguarded machinery

and housing violations.  The proposed penalties are the 15th highest

levied in the nation.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">DeCoster responded that it has

cleared up &quot;problems cited by the Immigration and Naturalization

Service&quot; on its farms, and that it would also clear up problems

identified by DOL.  DeCoster had been inspected 14 times since

1976, and critics wondered why it took DOL so long to conduct

a full investigation of a firm with a reputation for violating

labor laws, contesting fines and treating them as a cost of doing

business.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">After the DOL fine was announced,

DeCoster lost two of its biggest customers-- Hannaford Brothers

and Shop 'n Save, Maine's largest grocer.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In 1995, a task force of the State

Senate and Assembly issued a report that recommended that flush

toilets be required at all farm labor camps immediately, rather

than in 1999, and that all farm labor camps, rather than those

that house five or more workers, be inspected.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">An estimated 3,000 migrant workers

come to Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York each

year.  Most farmers provide housing at no cost to the workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There are reportedly 4,000  farm

workers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia.  In the

1990 Census, Hispanics were 2.5 percent of the populations of

Maryland and Virginia.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In Ohio, the Farm Labor Organizing

Committee in September 1996 sued the State Highway Patrol in U.S.

District Court, charging that troopers selectively stop and search

vehicles driven by Hispanics in searches for illegal drugs.  A

second federal lawsuit charges that the Ohio Health Department

has failed to do its job in overseeing living conditions in migrant

camps.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In April 1995, FLOC reached a

five-year agreement with the Vlasic Pickle Growers Association

that calls for workers to receive $4.70 per hour for thinning

and hoeing in 1995, rising to $5.15 an hour in 1998, as well as

50 percent of the value of the harvested cucumbers.</FONT></TT>
