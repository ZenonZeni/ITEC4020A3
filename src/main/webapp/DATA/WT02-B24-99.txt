<h1 align=center>Learning to Read -- Reading to  Learn<br>
Tips for Parents</h1>

<h2 align=center><i>Ways to help your child  with learning disabilities
become a better reader</i></h2>

<p>Parents can have a strong positive influence on their child's reading. 
Research has shown that enjoying books with a child for even a few minutes
a day can make a measurable difference in the acquisition of basic reading 
skills, and that everyday activities--such as a trip to the grocery store--can 
be turned into enjoyable learning experiences.

<p>Following is a list of ways in which parents can encourage the development 
of the skills needed by children in order for them to become good readers.

<h3>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Find time to read aloud with your child every day.</b> Typically,
parents play an important role in developing this skill by reading to children 
and showing how important reading is to their daily life. Lap time with
picture books and stories can strongly motivate your child to enjoy reading. 
Try to make these books available for your children to explore and enjoy
on their own as well.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Develop Awareness of Printed Language</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Teach about books.</b> When reading aloud to your child, let your
child open the book and turn the pages. Point to the words as you read.
Draw attention to repeated phrases, inviting your child to join in each time 
they occur.<br>

<li><b>Point out letters and words that you run across in daily life.</b> 
Make an obvious effort to read aloud traffic signs, billboards, notices,
labels on packages, maps, and phone numbers. Make outings a way to encourage 
reading by showing your child how printed words relate to daily living.
</ul>

<h3>Learn the Alphabet</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Play alphabet games.</b> Sing the alphabet song to help your child
learn letters as you play with alphabet books, blocks, and magnetic letters. 
Recite letters as you go up and down stairs or give pushes on a swing.
A-B-C, dot-to-dot and letter-play workbooks, games, and puzzles are available 
at most toy stores. Many engaging computer games are designed for teaching
children letters. Make sure these toys are available even when you are unable to
play along.<br>

<li><b>Watch "Sesame Street" with your child.</b> Show the child how to
sing along, answer the riddles, and engage actively in its fun.<br>

<li><b>Make writing materials available to your child and encourage their
use.</b> Help your child learn to write his/her name and other important words 
or phrases. Gradually, help the child learn to write more and more
letters. At first, most children find it easier to write uppercase letters.
</ul>

<h3>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>
Teach your child to spell a few special words,</b> such as his/her name,
"stop", or "exit."
Challenge the child to read these words every place they are seen. Draw 
attention to these and other frequently occurring words as you read books
with your child. Challenge the child to read these words as they arise or
to search them out on a page. Play word-building games with letter tiles
or magnetic letters. Have the child build strings of letters for you to
read.
</ul>

<h3>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables and Phonemes</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Sing songs and read rhyming books.</b> Sing the alphabet with your
child, and teach your child songs that emphasize rhyme and alliteration, such 
as "Willaby Wallaby Woo" and "Down By the Sea." Emphasize the sounds as
you sing. Play rhyming games and clap out names. Jumble the
wording or word order of familiar poems and challenge your child to detect the 
error. Talk like a robot, syllable by syllable.<br>

<li><b>Play word games.</b> Challenge your child to play with words. For
example, ask your child to think of words that rhyme with "bat" or begin with
/m/. What would be left if you took the /k/ sound out of ''cat"? What would
you have if you put these sounds together: /p/ and ickle; /m/ and ilk;
and /s/, /a/, and /t/. Which of these words starts with a different sound
-- "bag", "candy", "bike"? Do "boat" and "baby" start with the same sound?
</ul>

<h3>Learn Letter Sounds</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Sound out letters.</b>
Point out other words that begin with the same letter as your child's
name, drawing attention to the similarities of the beginning sound. Use 
alphabet books, computer games, or car games such as, "I'm thinking of
something that starts with /b/" to engage the child in alliterative and
letter-sound play. If you have a book that lends itself to alliteration
and rhyme, such as a Dr. Seuss book, sound out rhyming words as you read
or  challenge the child to do so for you. Play word games that connect
sounds with syllables and words. For example: If this spells "cat, how do you 
spell "hat"?
</ul>

<h3>Sound Out New Words</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>Point out new words.</b> As you encounter them, say the sound while
touching each letter in a new word. For example, say "s-u-n" and then blend
sounds to create the word. In practicing new words, use predictable words with
common sounds and spellings, like "fun" or "sat" instead of "night" or "saw."
<br><br>

If you encounter words with unknown meanings or with complex spellings,
encourage your child to try to sound out the words. However, if too many words
require this kind of attention and effort, it is best to find an easier book.

<li><b>Play spelling games with your child</b>
After your child begins pronouncing words, encourage spelling by saying each
sound in the words and then writing the letter that goes with the sound.
<br>

<li><b>Encourage your child to spell.</b> After your child has learned to
pronounce words, have the child say each sound.
<br>

<li><b>Independent writing</b>
Encourage your child to use inventive or independent spelling. At this stage, 
the child will tend to omit letters and confuse letter names with letter
sounds, producing such spellings as LFNT for elephant, BN for bean, and
FARE for fairy. Use correction wisely. You should be most concerned about
is the child's sensitivity to the sounds that need to be represented.
</ul>

<h3>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>
Help your children to read easy, enjoyable stories as often as possible.</b>
It is likely that your child will enjoy reading more and learn more from
reading if you sit together, taking turns reading and encouraging discussion.
In the beginning invite the child to read well-chosen words. Gradually, as the
child becomes able, take turns with sentences, speakers, paragraphs, and pages.
At the end of each section or story revisit those words that caused trouble.
Rereading the entire story over several days, and again weeks later, is
a powerful way to reinforce this learning.
</ul>

<h3>Know Spelling Patterns</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>
Now it becomes useful to point out the similarities between words</b> such
as will, fall, and hill or light, night, and sight. This is also the time to
help your child learn the correct spelling of the words he/she writes.
</ul>

<h3>Learn to Read Reflectively</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>
Pause for discussions as you read.</b> As you read stories to and with
your child, stop frequently to discuss their language, content, and
relevance to real life and other knowledge Pause to explore the meanings of 
new words, using them in other sentences and contrasting what they mean
with words that have similar meanings. Make an effort to revisit new words 
and concepts later, when the book has been put aside. When reading stories, 
pause to discuss the various characters, problems, events in the story,
and invite your child to think about how the problems might be solved or
to wonder about what might happen next. When resuming a story, ask your
child to review what has happened so hr, drawing attention to looming 
mysteries and unresolved conflicts In reading expository text, invite the 
child to marvel at the creatures or events described and to wonder about
details or connections not mentioned by the text.<br>

<li><b>Above  all: Read,  read, and re-read.</b>
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Glossary</h2>

<p><b>Alphabetic awareness -</b> Knowledge of the letters of the alphabet 
coupled with the understanding that the alphabet represents the sounds of
the spoken language.

<p><b>Alphabetic understanding -</b>  The understanding that, in principle, the
left-to-right spelling of printed words represents their phonemes from first 
to last.

<p><b>Background knowledge -</b>  All children bring some level of
background knowledge to beginning reading (e.g., how to hold a book, knowledge 
of words, knowledge of the world). Priming this background
knowledge--relating new knowledge so that which is already
known--helps children draw on their experiences as a means of understanding 
new information. When sufficient background knowledge does not exist, it
will be necessary to adjust instruction accordingly.

<p><b>Fluency -</b> The ease with which students translate print to speech.

<p><b>Phonemes -</b>  The elementary speech sounds represented by the letters 
of a perfect alphabet. In the English alphabet, which is not perfect, some
phonemes are represented by combinations of letters (e.g., /th/, /sh/),
and some letters represent more than one phoneme (e.g., c, g, a, e, i, o, u).

<p><b>Phonemic awareness -</b> The awareness that spoken words or syllables 
can be thought of as a sequence of phonemes. Phonemic awareness is a
sub-category of phonological awareness.

<p><b>Phonological awareness -</b> The ability to attend to the phonological 
or sound structure of language as distinct from its meaning. Types of
phonological awareness include word awareness, syllable awareness, rhyme 
awareness, and phonemic awareness.

<p><b>Phonological decoding -</b>  Translating the letters or spelling patterns
of a written word into speech patterns in order to identify the word and
to gain access to its meaning.

<p><b>Phonological encoding -</b>  Writing a letter or word based on its sounds.

<p><b>Phonological recoding -</b> Translating the spelling of written words 
into the speech sounds they represent.

<p><b>Print awareness (orthographic  awareness) -</b> Awareness of how print 
works and how it looks. Print is made up of letters, the letters
correspond to sounds and words, and text is read from left to right across
the page.<br>
