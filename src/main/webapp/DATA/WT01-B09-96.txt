<B>Project Title: Flywheel Surge Power Unit<p>
Performing Organization: United Technologies Flywheel Development</B>

<P><B>Project Goals and Technologies</B></P>


               

<P>United Technologies is developing a flywheel surge power unit for automotive hybrid vehicle applications
and has tested three prototype units over the past two years, one under the ARPA / NAVC program.
UTC's efforts have concentrated on a passenger car Flywheel Surge Power Unit (FSPU) having a rated
power of 25 to 50 kW and an energy storage capability of 800 Wh at 35,000 RPI\/I. Flywheel units are
also being designed for electric utility energy storage and power quality applications under separate
funding.</P>

<P>UTC's current FSPU system consists of an outer vacuum containment vessel an inner containment ring,
a rotating composite rotor/hub/back-iron/ assembly, a water­cooled motor/generator, and a magnetic
bearing system. The flywheel rotor consists of the composite wheel, the hub, and the cylinder which
contains the back­iron of the motor/generator and magnetic bearings. Major factors which determine the
design include energy storage capacity, cost, number of spin­up and spin­down cycles, and size
constraints. The use of a conical section hub to attach the wheel to the back­iron shaft is standard gas
turbine technology. It provides an axi­symmetric attachment to the wheel and can be tailored to isolate
the deflection of the flywheel from the deflection of the shaft.. The primary bearing support system
consists of two radial and one axial permanent magnet-based magnetic bearings. This controller contains
the algorithm used to adjust the force and damping properties of the bearings as a function of rotor speed.
The motor/generator is a permanent magnet design having a water­cooled stator. </P>

<P>The vacuum/containment vessel is designed for ease of assembly / disassembly of prototype units and is
therefore fairly large compared to a production version. A steel containment ring structure is located
around the rotor for containment of the rotating mass. A light weight containment system is envisioned in
a final design. Tests of 30 cm diameter sub­scale wheels have resulted in "shredded wheat" type material
after intentional burst Several tests have been performed to fail the 12.3 kg, 40 cm diameter full scale
composite flywheel. Attempts to fail the wheel itself in this configuration at or below maximum operating
speed by intentionally weakening the composite have so far been unsuccessful. Tests which simulated
failure of the bearing system were performed by intentionally dropping the wheel at speed onto the
containment structure The wheel simply rotated until it came to a stop, apparently bouncing off the sides
and wearing off the side surfaces, indicating a robust design.</P>

<P>Intentional failure mode testing of a complete system is planned in the near future. </P>
