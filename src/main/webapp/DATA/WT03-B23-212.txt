<P>DRUNK DRIVING:Ten basic questions and answers you need to know
<H2>From KPIX Legal
 Analyst Peter Keane
</H2><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Certain features of the laws relating to drunk driving
differ from 
 state to state. Some of the main differences are: the amount of 
 alcohol in a person's bloodstream that constitutes being under the 
 influence, the exact length of jail sentences and the amount of fines 
 that may be imposed. This article is based on California law which is 
 similar to the laws of many other states.
</H3><H3>1. Q: Do you have to be "drunk" to be guilty of drunk driving?
</H3><P>A: No. Years ago, a drunk driving charge meant someone was "drunk"

 in the way all of us commonly understand the word - intoxicated. But 
 today, intoxication as we know it is not required for one to be guilty 
 of drunk driving. During the last ten years public outcry against the
 toll of injury and death which drinking drivers inflict has changed 
 the laws against drunk driving radically and made them much more 
 severe. So the criminal laws against drinking and driving now mean 
 operating a vehicle with considerably less alcohol in your system than 
 what we customarily recognize as being enough to make a person drunk.
<P>You may not think you are drunk. Those around you may not think you 
 are drunk. Indeed, for the purpose of every other situation except 
 driving, you may not even be considered drunk. But your condition may 
 be enough for you to be found guilty of a drunk driving offense under 
 the current definition of the law. And if you are convicted, you will 
 suffer some very harsh penalties.
<H3>2. Q: Legally, just what is "drunk driving?"
</H3><P>A: A drunk driving offense, sometimes called driving while 
 intoxicated (DWI) or driving under the influence (DUI), really has 
 three general meanings:
<P>(1) Driving with any amount of alcohol in your system which causes 
 your physical abilities to be impaired in any way.
<P>(2) Driving with a level of alcohol in your system which amounts to
 a measurement of.08 of blood alcohol content. To be guilty of this 
 offense, absolutely no impairment of any of your physical abilities 
 is necessary. You may well be the world's most talented, careful and
 safest driver, but if your blood alcohol content registers .08 or 
 above you are guilty of a criminal offense.
<P>(3) Driving with drugs in your system or with a combination of drugs and
alcohol, no
 matter what the amounts of those substances may be, where your 
 physical abilities have become impaired in any way. It does not 
 matter if the drugs are legal , over the counter medications
 like antihistamines, nor does it matter if you have a prescription 
 to take the drugs. If you are impaired as a result of taking them, 
 then you are guilty of a criminal offense.
<H3>3. Q: What amount of alcohol do I need to drink to have a blood 
 alcohol content of .08 or higher?
</H3><P>A: Each person's blood alcohol content from drinking certain 
 amounts of alcohol will vary, depending upon a number of factors. 
 The main factor is your weight. To calculate your blood alcohol 
 content based upon having normal drinks such as a 12 oz. beer, a 
 4 ounce glass of wine, or a single mixed drink containing a one 
 ounce shot of 100 proof liquor, the following rule of thumb is an 
 illustration: 
 
 <BR>120 lbs: one drink in one hour -- .032
 <BR>two drinks in one hour -- .064
 <BR>three drinks in one hour -- .096 
 <BR>180 lbs: one drink in one hour -- .021
 <BR>two drinks in one hour -- .042
 <BR>three drinks in one hour -- .063
 <BR>four drinks in one hour -- .084
<H3>4. Q: What kind of reason does a police officer or highway 
 patrolman need to have in order to stop me to investigate whether 
 or not I am driving under the influence?
</H3><P>A: The officer must have what is legally termed a "reasonable 
 suspicion," based on something unusual that is actually observed 
 about the way a person is driving. This is a very low standard and 
 it can be satisfied by virtually anything which appears out of the 
 ordinary and that might be a sign of a driver being under the 
 influence. In addition, during holiday seasons, police officers 
 typically set up field sobriety checkpoints where they routinely 
 stop every driver who passes through the checkpoint. These checkpoints 
 do not require the officer to observe anything suspicious about a 
 person before stopping and investigating someone.
<H3>5. Q: What happens to me if I am pulled over by the police or the 
 highway patrol for investigation of drunk driving?
</H3><P>A: If you are stopped, always be courteous and cooperative with 
 the officer even if you are 100% clean of any type of alcohol or 
 drugs, and even if you are certain that your driving did not show 
 anything unusual. Never argue with the officer. Law enforcement is a 
 tough, often nerve wracking job and the "attitude" you show to the 
 officer can often make all the difference as to whether or not the 
 encounter will be an unpleasant one for you.
<H3>6. Q: What will happen if the officer who pulls me over suspects that
I have been driving under
 the influence?
</H3><P>A: The officer will ask you to get out of the car and will 
 instruct you to perform a series of "field sobriety tests." These are 
 standard physical ability measures and they include:
 <BR>(1) Reciting the alphabet from A to Z;
 <BR>(2) Closing your eyes and bringing both index fingers together;
 <BR>(3) Walking along a straight line;
 <BR>(4) Standing on one foot for a few seconds;
 <BR>(5) Picking up a coin dropped on the ground;
 
 In addition to these tests, some officers typically have certain 
 field sobriety testing devices which they use. One such device is a 
 breath meter which you blow into. another is a light to shine in your 
 eyes in order to test your pupil reaction. It is very important that 
 if you suffer from any chronic physical problems, such as difficulty
 with your balance, problems walking or with your legs or feet, that 
 you inform the officer of these things before you go through the 
 field sobriety tests.
<H3>7. Q: What happens if the officer believes that I have not 
 performed the field sobriety tests satisfactorily?
</H3><P>A: At that point you will be told that you are under arrest for 
 driving under the influence. You will be hand cuffed, searched for 
 weapons, placed in the back of the officer's car and taken to a
 jail for further tests. At the jail you will also be booked and held 
 there until you post bail or until a judge releases you on your own 
 recognizance without bail. Once again, as upsetting and as stressful 
 as being arrested is, it is essential that you continue to act 
 courteously and cooperatively with the officer. Do not argue, 
 threaten or become belligerent in any way. This type of behavior will 
 only make the experience even more unpleasant for you.
<H3>8. Q: What is a blood alcohol test?
</H3><P>A: This is a physical procedure to determine how much alcohol you
 actually have in your system. There are three ways of doing this 
 test:
 <BR>(1) Drawing a sample of blood from your arm;
 <BR>(2) Obtaining a urine sample;
 <BR>(3) Obtaining a breath sample by having you blow into a machine 
 called a breathalyzer; (This is different from the field sobriety 
 breath device described above. The breathalyzer is much more 
 sophisticated and exact.
<P>You have the choice of which one of these three tests you will take. 
 The only time your ability to choose which test you take can legally 
 be restricted is if you are in a locality that simply does not have a
 breathalyzer. The officer is required to tell you that the option as to
which test you take is up to you. But 
 quite often officers will try to pressure or browbeat a person into
 taking the blood test because this is the most effective procedure 
 for the prosecution to use against a person in court. You do not have 
 the right to refuse to take any test. Legally, the officer could hold 
 you down and forcibly draw a blood sample from your veins. In 
 practice this rarely happens except where an accident is involved 
 which caused death or serious bodily injury. Instead, if you refuse
 to take a test, your driver's license is automatically suspended for one
year. Also, in your trial,
 the jury will be told that you refused to take the test and the judge will
instruct the jury that they
 can consider your refusal as evidence of your guilt.
<H3>9. Q: What should I know in order to make an intelligent choice about
which blood alcohol test
 I should take?
</H3><P>A: As mentioned above, from the standpoint of the police and 
 prosecution they will always prefer to have the more accurate sample 
 of your actual blood to use against you as evidence in court. The 
 least accurate and least reliable test is of a urine sample. However, 
 if it has been some period of time from when you had your last drink 
 to when you give the urine sample, the sample may test out to your 
 disadvantage with an inaccurately high reading against you. This is
 because in such a situation, the alcohol content in your excreted 
 urine is actually greater than the amount of alcohol you have 
 remaining in your system.
<P>On the other hand, a breath test may show an inaccurately high 
 reading against you if you take the breath test shortly after your 
 last drink. This is because of the high alcohol content lingering in 
 the mouth, esophagus, and the upper digestive system. If you have 
 used any kind of breath spray, mouthwash or even should you burp 
 shortly before the breath test, then the reading could be 
 inaccurately high against you. Both the blood and the urine samples 
 will also show the presence of drugs as well as alcohol. However a 
 breath test can only determine alcohol content and nothing about 
 drugs. Whichever test you take must be given to you within 3 hours of 
 when you were driving.
<H3>10. Q: What are the penalties for driving while under the 
 influence?
</H3><P>A: Drunk driving penalties have become very severe in the past few

 years. For a first offense, the maximum possible penalties the court 
 could impose are:
 <BR>(1) 6 months in the county jail:
 <BR>(2) $1,000 fine plus up to an additional $1,950 in penalty assessments;
 <BR>(3) 6 months driver's license suspension;
 <BR>(4) Your car impounded for 30 days.
<P>Second, third and fourth offenses within 7 years are punished by 
 increasingly more harsh penalties. For third and fourth convictions, 
 your license must be revoked for 3 and 4 years respectively. A fourth 
 offense can even be prosecuted against you as a felony carrying a
 maximum term of 3 years in state prison along with your car being 
 ordered sold and the proceeds going to the state. In addition to all of
the above penalties, the price of auto 
 insurance increases drastically after any conviction for a driving 
 under the influence offense.
<P>The bottom line legal and practical advice to draw from all of all 
 of the above is very clear:
<P>IT IS NEVER WORTH IT TO DRINK AND DRIVE.
