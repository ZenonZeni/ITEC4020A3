<h3 align=center>ROSEN MOTORS ANNOUNCES<br>
WORLD&#146;S FIRST SUCCESSFUL ROAD TEST<br>
OF TURBINE-FLYWHEEL POWERTRAIN FOR AUTOMOBILES</h3>
<p>WOODLAND HILLS, CALIF. -- Jan. 7, 1997 -- Rosen Motors, founded in 1993 by brothers Benjamin M. Rosen and 
Harold A. Rosen, announced today the first successful road test of its experimental hybrid-electric powertrain for automobiles. 
This historic road test makes Rosen Motors the only company to have demonstrated the viability of using a flywheel-turbine 
combination to power an electric automobile.</p>
<p>The Rosen TurboFlywheel (RTF) powertrain has the potential to simultaneously provide unusually long range, nearly zero 
emissions and sports car-like acceleration, a combination of characteristics that neither the internal combustion engine nor a 
battery-powered electric drivetrain can offer. </p>
<p>&#147;To us, this demonstration is akin to the first flight of a jet aircraft: proof that our technology works and the first major step to 
building a superior mode of transportation,&#148; said Dr. Harold Rosen, president and chief executive officer of Rosen Motors.</p>
<p>&#147;This is a milestone in automotive history,&#148; said Benjamin M. Rosen, chairman of Rosen Motors. &#147;Our hybrid-electric 
powertrain, in contrast to some other hybrid-electric concepts under investigation by automobile manufacturers, is not simply a 
&#145;range extender&#146; for a battery-powered vehicle. Instead, it is an innovative system that will also sharply cut fossil fuel 
consumption and measurably improve the performance of the 21st century automobile.&#148; </p>
<p>The dramatic road test was performed on Sunday, Jan. 5 at the Willow Springs racetrack in the Mojave Desert near Edwards 
Air Force Base. For the initial proof-of-concept, Rosen Motors tested the RTF powertrain in a converted 1993 Saturn 
vehicle. </p>
<p>The powertrain consists of four major elements: a turbogenerator, a flywheel motor-generator, an electric drive motor and an 
electronic control system. The turbogenerator, which uses unleaded gasoline as its fuel, produces cruising power for the 
vehicle. The flywheel, via its motor-generator, supplies surge power for acceleration and recovers power from regenerative 
braking for later reuse. The electronic controller provides the &#147;brains&#148; and the power switching for the system.</p>
<p>Development efforts are continuing at Rosen Motors to improve the design and characteristics of the RTF powertrain. Road 
testing of a more advanced design of the RTF powertrain, to be housed in a luxury sports sedan, is expected to begin in late 
1997. </p>
<p>Future Rosen-powered cars, depending on their weight and aerodynamic characteristics, are expected to obtain more than 
double the gasoline mileage of today&#146;s cars and to provide vehicle acceleration from zero to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. 
In addition, future versions of Rosen-powered automobiles are projected to produce tailpipe emissions that are no greater than 
those caused by the emissions due to recharging battery-powered vehicles from fossil-fueled power plants.</p>
<p>Benjamin M. Rosen and his brother, Dr. Harold A. Rosen, started Rosen Motors after each had many years of success in 
technology venture capital and communications engineering, respectively. Ben Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer and 
co-founder of Sevin Rosen Funds, a venture capital firm, was listed by Computerworld magazine in 1992 as one of 25 people 
in the computer industry who &#147;changed the world.&#148;</p>
<p>Harold Rosen, a pioneer in communications technology, is recognized as the father of the geostationary communications 
satellite, the world&#146;s first practical commercial communications satellite. He has won numerous prestigious engineering awards 
in many countries, including the Draper Prize in 1995, the world&#146;s top award in engineering.</p>
<p>Ben and Harold Rosen are also founding directors of <a href="http://www.capstoneturbine.com/">Capstone Turbine Corporation</a>, which supplies the gas-turbine 
generator, one of the key elements of the Rosen Motors powertrain. Capstone Turbine is a developer of small gas 
turbine-driven electric generators (turbogenerators) for both vehicular and stationary power. </p>
<p>Privately funded Rosen Motors develops hybrid electric powertrains for automobiles and flywheel systems for stationary 
power applications. Headquartered in Woodland Hills, Calif., Rosen Motors employs 60 people.</p>
