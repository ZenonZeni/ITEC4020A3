<p align="center"><b>Founder of 'Our Church' Receives 10-Year
Sentence In Marijuana Case</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 11, <i>The Morning News</i> (of Northwest Arkansas)
reported that Tom Brown, the controversial founder and former
leader of Our Church, was sentenced in federal court to 10 years in
prison.&nbsp; Brown was also fined $17,500 and had 39 acres of
land forfeited to the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown asserts that the church uses marijuana as part of its
religious service. <i>The Morning News</i> reported that
&quot;Our Church and its members say they have a constitutional right
under freedom of religion to use [marijuana, as a form of
sacrament,] during their church services. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Brown] attempted to argue his case at the sentencing hearing,
but [U.S. District Judge] Waters wouldn't allow it.&nbsp; Brown,
disregarding Waters...said he would have been found innocent if
he had been allowed to argue that his religious freedom permitted
him to use marijuana in church services. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It was an invalid indictment, an invalid prosecution, an
invalid conviction,&quot; Brown said. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Legislation About To
'Disappear' From Colorado Law</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 6, The Colorado House effectively ended one of the
nation's first medical marijuana laws when it passed Senate Bill
95-1020.&nbsp; The official death of the medical marijuana law
will occur when Governor Roy Romer (D) signs the new bill --
which deletes older, &quot;obsolescent&quot; legislation -- into
law in the coming weeks. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;Dangerous Drugs Therapeutic Act&quot; which established
provisions for the disbursal of marijuana for medical purposes
has been on the books since 1979.&nbsp; However, due to the law's wording--which
necessitated approval from the National Cancer Institute, the FDA
and the DEA--reportedly no one ever received cannabis to smoke
during the program's 16-year existence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>[Conversely,] Missouri Senate To Consider
&quot;Medical Necessity&quot; Defense<br>
For Citizens Using Medicinal Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 28, The Missouri Senate agreed to hear Senate Bill
457, introduced by Sen. Joseph Moseley, which succinctly states: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    No criminal or civil penalty shall apply to any person for
    the act of possessing marijuana provided that requirements of
    the following two subdivisions of this section are met
    simultaneously: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    (1) A practitioner authorized to prescribe Schedule II
    controlled substances for human use certifies in writing that
    the person is under the professional care of the practitioner
    for a duly diagnosed condition; and <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    (2) The aforementioned practitioner certifies in writing that
    the person needs marijuana as part of a therapeutic regimen
    directed against the duly diagnosed condition. 
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>Texas Criminal Defense Attorney Indicted On
Marijuana Charges<br>
Goes On Hunger Strike To Protest Lack Of Marinol</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 23, The Beaumont Enterprise reported that a former
Jefferson County prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer is
protesting his marijuana-related arrest by refusing to eat solid
foods. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In what can only be described as a bizarre case, Alan D.
McLemore, 43, was arrested at his home February 8 on marijuana
cultivation and gun charges. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Background] McLemore has had a life long battle with clinical
depression.&nbsp; In time, McLemore received a prescription for
Marinol [synthetic marijuana pill -ed.].&nbsp; McLemore found that
Marinol not only stabilized his depression, it also curbed his
craving for alcohol.&nbsp; Due to the high cost and very limited
quantities of Marinol, McLemore supplemented medication with marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Finally able to lead a normal life, McLemore got a law degree,
became an assistant district attorney, and eventually opened his
own law office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon his arrest in February, McLemore, after posting bond,
returned to jail because he felt as though he could not honor the
judges order that he not consume marijuana while out on
bond.&nbsp; McLemore stated that he didn't want to have his
mother lose her home (McLemore's mother put her home up for the
$l00,000 bond) because of his desperate need for an effective
medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">During McLemore's hunger strike, he has lost as much as 25
pounds.&nbsp; McLemore, in an issued statement from jail,
reported by the <i>Beaumont Enterprise</i>, said, &quot;Uncaring
legislatures, that have been totally corrupted by money, have
denied me and millions of others the relief this wonderful plant
provides.&nbsp; I have no liberty; the pursuit of happiness has
been denied me; and life is therefore a burden that I'm anxious
to relinquish. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on this medical marijuana case, contact
either Houston NORML's Ralph Hodges, 713-797-6567 or Judy
McLemore (Alan's mother), 409-423-2429.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Largest Drug Testing Company Reports A Steep
Decline In<br>
Positive Drug Tests -- Except MARIJUANA!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 6, SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories reported
that there has been a drastic reduction in the number of people
testing positive for drug use -- while at the same time, the rate
of positive test results for marijuana shot up. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SmithKline found that of more than 3.6 million drug tests
performed at their labs last year, 7.5 percent were positive for
drug use, a drop of 0.9 percentage points from 1993.&nbsp; Those
testing positive for marijuana use rose 7.2 percents to 47.1
percent of all positive tests.&nbsp; Second was cocaine at 23.9
percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Associated Press</i> reports that SmithK1ine Beecham said
&quot;a change in the screening threshold for marijuana required
by the Department of Transportation (DOT) could account for the increase
in positive tests for marijuana use.&nbsp; [<b>NORML</b>
agrees.&nbsp; Beginning on January 1, DOT regulations mandate
that the threshold for positive marijuana screen be lowered from
100ng to 50ng.&nbsp; Reducing the &quot;cut-off&quot; level by
50% readily explains why positive urinalysis' for marijuana went
up. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The survey isn't based on a scientific sampling of workers
nationwide. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For a copy of this report, contact Tobey Dichter, SmithKline
Beecham Clinical Laboratories, 800-877-7478 or 610-454-6201.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Head Of DEA Claims That The U.S. Is Losing
&quot;War On Drugs&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 9, The <i>Boston Herald</i> reported that the DEA's
top-cop believes that after 15 years and $34 billion, the much
hyped War on Drugs is a half-hearted campaign... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;No matter how much we seize, it doesn't seem to change the
amount coming into the country&quot;, said Thomas A. Constantine,
chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Constantine went on to say that, &quot;<u>To use that euphemism
of a 'War on Drugs' or a 'War on Crime', </u><b><u>I have not
seen that yet</u></b><u>.</u>&quot;&nbsp; He further added,
&quot;When you have a war, that means as citizens--you make
sacrifices (harkening back to the World War II days of food
rationing and Gold Star mothers).&nbsp; <u>That's what I call a
war and it's a national will</u>.&quot;&nbsp; [emphasis added
-ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director, asked, &quot;Just what
sacrifices does Mr. Constantine have in mind?&nbsp; As a nation,
we've arrested almost ten million Americans on marijuana charges.&nbsp;
How many more Americans does Mr. Constantine want to
sacrifice?&quot; </p>
