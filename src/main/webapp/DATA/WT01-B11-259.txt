<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Common Stock and Preferred
Stock</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold"> Equity Funds, Balanced
Funds, Total Return Bond Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Common
stockholders are the owners of the company issuing the stock and,
accordingly, vote on various corporate governance matters such
as mergers. They are not creditors of the company, but rather,
upon liquidation of the company are entitled to their pro rata
share of the company's assets after creditors (including fixed
income security holders) and, if applicable, preferred stockholders
are paid. Preferred stock is a class of stock having a preference
over common stock as to dividends and, in the alternative, as
to the recovery of investment. A preferred stockholder is a shareholder
in the company and not a creditor of the company as is a holder
of the company's fixed income securities. Dividends paid to common
and preferred stockholders are distributions of the earnings of
the company and not interest payments, which are expenses of the
company. Equity securities owned by a Fund may be traded on national
securities exchanges, in the over-the-counter market or on a regional
securities exchange and may not be traded every day or in the
volume typical of securities traded on a major national securities
exchange. As a result, disposition by a Fund of a portfolio security
to meet redemptions by shareholders or otherwise may require the
Fund to sell these securities at a discount from market prices,
to sell during periods when disposition is not desirable, or to
make many small sales over an extended period of time. The market
value of all securities, including equity securities, is based
upon the market's perception of value and not necessarily the
book value of an issuer or other objective measure of a company's
worth.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Convertible Securities</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Equity Funds, Balanced Funds, Total Return Bond Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Convertible
securities, which include convertible debt, convertible preferred
stock and other securities exchangeable under certain circumstances
for shares of common stock, are fixed income securities or preferred
stock which generally may be converted at a stated price within
a specific amount of time into a specified number of shares of
common stock. A convertible security entitles the holder to receive
interest paid or accrued on debtor the dividend paid on preferred
stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted
or exchanged. Before conversion, convertible securities have characteristics
similar to nonconvertible debt securities in that they ordinarily
provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than those
of common stocks of the same or similar issuers. These securities
are usually senior to common stock in a company's capital structure,
but usually are subordinated to non-convertible debt securities.
In general, the value of a convertible security is the higher
of its investment value (its value as a fixed income security)
and its conversion value (the value of the underlying shares of
common stock if the security is converted). As a fixed income
security, the value of a convertible security generally increases
when interest rates decline and generally decreases when interest
rates rise. The value of a convertible security is, however, also
influenced by the value of the underlying common stock. Contrarian
Stock Fund and Small Company Stock Fund currently intend to limit
their investments in convertible securities, and the other Funds
may only invest in convertible securities, that are investment
grade.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may invest in equity-linked
securities, including Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock
(&quot;PERCS&quot;), Equity-Linked Securities (&quot;ELKS&quot;),
and Liquid Yield Option Notes (&quot;LYONS&quot;). Equity-Linked
Securities are securities that are convertible into or based upon
the value of, equity securities upon certain terms and conditions.
The amount received by an investor at maturity of these securities
is not fixed but is based on the price of the underlying common
stock, which may rise or fall. In addition, it is not possible
to predict how equity-linked securities will trade in the secondary
market or whether the market for them will be liquid or illiquid.

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Warrants</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Equity Funds, Balanced Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may invest in warrants, which are options to purchase an
equity security at a specified price (usually representing a premium
over the applicable market value of the underlying equity security
at the time of the warrant's issuance) and usually during a specified
period of time. Unlike convertible securities and preferred stocks,
warrants do not pay a fixed dividend. Investments in warrants
involve certain risks, including the possible lack of a liquid
market for the resale of the warrants, potential price fluctuations
as a result of speculation or other factors and failure of the
price of the underlying security to reach a level at which the
warrant can be prudently exercised (in which case the warrant
may expire without being exercised, resulting in the loss of the
Fund's entire investment therein).<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">ADRs and EDRs</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Equity Funds (except Index Fund and Small Company Growth Fund),
Balanced Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund
may invest in sponsored and unsponsored American Depository Receipts
(&quot;ADRs&quot;), which are receipts issued by an American bank
or trust company evidencing ownership of underlying securities
issued by a foreign issuer. ADRs, in registered form, are designed
for use in U.S. securities markets. Unsponsored ADRs may be created
without the participation of the foreign issuer. Holders of these
ADRs generally bear all the costs of the ADR facility, whereas
foreign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored ADR.
The bank or trust company depository of an unsponsored ADR may
be under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications
received from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights.
A Fund (other than Contrarian Stock Fund and Small Company Stock
Fund) may also invest in European Depository Receipts (&quot;EDRs&quot;),
receipts issued by a European financial institution evidencing
an arrangement similar to that of ADRs, and in other similar instruments
representing securities of foreign companies. EDRs, in bearer
form, are designed for use in European securities markets.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">U.S. Government Securities</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As used
in this Prospectus, the term U.S. Government Securities means
obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest
by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. The
U.S. Government Securities in which a Fund may invest include
U.S. Treasury Securities and obligations issued or guaranteed
by U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities and backed by
the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, such as those
guaranteed by the Small Business Administration or issued by the
Government National Mortgage Association. In addition, the U.S.
Government Securities in which the Funds may invest include securities
supported primarily or solely by the creditworthiness of the issuer,
such as securities of the Federal National Mortgage Association,
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Tennessee Valley
Authority. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Government will
support securities not backed by its full faith and credit. Accordingly,
although these securities have historically involved little risk
of loss of principal if held to maturity, they may involve more
risk than securities backed by the U.S. Government's full faith
and credit.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Zero-Coupon Securities</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Fixed Income Funds, Balanced Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may invest in separately traded principal and interest components
of securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. These
components are traded independently under the Treasury's Separate
Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities(&quot;STRIPS&quot;)
program or as Coupons Under Book Entry Safekeeping (&quot;CUBES&quot;).
The Funds may invest in other types of related zero-coupon securities.
For instance, a number of banks and brokerage firms separate the
principal and interest portions of U.S. Treasury securities and
sell them separately in the form of receipts or certificates representing
undivided interests in these instruments. These instruments are
generally held by a bank in a custodial or trust account on behalf
of the owners of the securities and are known by various names,
including Treasury Receipts (&quot;TRs&quot;), Treasury Investment
Growth Receipts (&quot;TIGRs&quot;) and Certificates of Accrual
on Treasury Securities (&quot;CATS&quot;). Zero-coupon securities
also may be issued by corporations and municipalities.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Zero-coupon securities are sold
at original issue discount and pay no interest to holders prior
to maturity, but a Fund holding a zero-coupon security must include
a portion of the original issue discount of the security as income.
Because of this, zero-coupon securities may be subject to greater
fluctuation of market value than the other securities in which
the Funds may invest. The Funds distribute all of their net investment
income, and may have to sell portfolio securities to distribute
imputed income, which may occur at a time when the Adviser or
Schroder would not have chosen to sell such securities and which
may result in a taxable gain or loss.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Corporate Debt Securities -
Balanced Funds, Fixed Income Funds, Contrarian Stock Fund, Small
Company Stock Fund. Commercial Paper - All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The
corporate debt securities in which the Funds may invest include
corporate bonds and notes and short-term investments such as commercial
paper and variable rate demand notes. Commercial paper (short-term
promissory notes) is issued by companies to finance their or their
affiliates' current obligations and is frequently unsecured. Variable
and floating rate demand notes are unsecured obligations redeemable
upon not more than 30 days' notice. These obligations include
master demand notes that permit investment of fluctuating amounts
at varying rates of interest pursuant to direct arrangement with
the issuer of the instrument. The issuer of these obligations
often has the right, after a given period, to prepay the outstanding
principal amount of the obligations upon a specified number of
days' notice. These obligations generally are not traded, nor
generally is there an established secondary market for these obligations.
To the extent a demand note does not have a 7 day or shorter demand
feature and there is no readily available market for the obligation,
it is treated as an illiquid security.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Financial Institution
Obligations</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold"> All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may invest in obligations of financial institutions, including
negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and time
deposits of U.S. banks (including savings banks and savings associations),
foreign branches of U.S. banks, foreign banks and their non-U.S.
branches (Eurodollars), U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks (Yankee dollars), and wholly-owned banking-related subsidiaries
of foreign banks. Short Maturity style of Conservative Balanced
Fund limits these purchases to institutions which at the time
of investment have total assets in excess of 1 billion dollars,
or the equivalent in other currencies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Certificates of deposit represent
an institution's obligation to repay funds deposited with it that
earn a specified interest rate over a given period. Bankers' acceptances
are negotiable obligations of a bank to pay a draft which has
been drawn by a customer and are usually backed by goods in international
trade. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits with a banking
institution that earn a specified interest rate over a given period.
Certificates of deposit and fixed time deposits, which are payable
at the stated maturity date and bear a fixed rate of interest,
generally may be withdrawn on demand but maybe subject to early
withdrawal penalties which could reduce the Fund's yield. Deposits
subject to early withdrawal penalties or that mature in more than
7 days are treated as illiquid securities if there is no readily
available market for the securities. A Fund's investments in the
obligations of foreign banks and their branches, agencies or subsidiaries
may be obligations of the parent, of the issuing branch, agency
or subsidiary, or both. Investments in foreign bank obligations
are limited to banks and branches located in countries which the
Advisers believe do not present undue risk.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Participation Interests</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Balanced Funds, Managed Fixed Income Fund, Ready Cash Investment
Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may purchase
participation interests in loans or securities in which the Fund
may invest directly that are owned by banks or other financial
institutions. A participation interest gives the Fund an undivided
interest in a loan or security in the proportion that the Fund's
interest bears to the total principal amount of the security.
Participation interests, which may have fixed, floating or variable
rates, may carry a demand feature backed by a letter of credit
or guarantee of the bank or institution permitting the holder
to tender them back to the bank or other institution. For certain
participation interests the Fund will</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">have the right to demand
payment, on not more than 7 days' notice, for all or a part of
the Fund's participation interest. A Fund will only purchase participation
interests from banks or other financial institutions that the
Adviser deems to be creditworthy. A Fund will not invest more
than 10 percent of its total assets in participation interests
in which the Fund does not have demand rights.<BR>

Restricted Securities - International Fund, Balanced Funds, Fixed
In-come Funds (except Ready Cash Investment Fund). </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
Fund may invest up to 15 percent (10 per-cent in the case of Ready
Cash Investment Fund) of its net assets in securities that at
the time of purchase are illiquid. Historically, illiquid securities
have included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions
on resale because they have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933(&quot;restricted securities&quot;), securities which
are otherwise not readily marketable, such as over-the-counter
options, and repurchase agreements not entitling the holder to
payment of principal in 7 days. Limitations on resale may have
an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities
and a Fund might also have to register restricted securities in
order to dispose of them, resulting in expense and delay. A Fund
might not be able to dispose of restricted or other securities
promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience
difficulty satisfying redemptions. There can be no assurance that
a liquid market will exist for any security at any particular
time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">An institutional market has developed
for certain securities that are not registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, including repurchase agreements, commercial paper,
foreign securities and corporate bonds and notes. Institutional
investors depend on an efficient institutional market in which
the unregistered security can be readily resold or on the issuer's
ability to honor a demand for repayment of the unregistered security.
A securities contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the
general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative
of the liquidity of the security. If such securities are eligible
for purchase by institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933 or other exemptions, the Advisers
may determine that such securities are not illiquid securities,
under guidelines or other exemptions adopted by the Board. These
guidelines take into account trading activity in the securities
and the availability of reliable pricing information, among other
factors. If there is a lack of trading interest in a particular
Rule 144A security, a Fund's holdings of that security may be
illiquid.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Borrowing</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund
may borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes, including
the meeting of redemption requests, in amounts up to 33 1/3 percent
of the Fund's total assets. Borrowing involves special risk considerations.
Interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing market
rates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the return
earned on borrowed funds (or on the assets that were retained
rather than sold to meet the needs for which funds were borrowed).
Under adverse market conditions, a Fund might have to sell portfolio
securities to meet interest or principal payments at a time when
investment considerations would not favor such sales. No Fund,
other than Managed Fixed Income Fund, Intermediate U.S. Government
Fund and, to the extent they invest in the Managed Fixed Income
Fund style or the Short Maturity style, the Balanced Funds may
purchase securities for investment while any borrowing equal to
5 percent or more of the Fund's total assets is outstanding or
borrow for purposes other than meeting redemptions in an amount
exceeding 5 per-cent of the value of the Fund's total assets.
A Fund's use of borrowed proceeds to make investments would subject
the Fund to the risks of leveraging. Reverse repurchase agreements,
short sales not against the box, dollar roll transactions and
other similar investments that involve a form of leverage have
characteristics similar to borrowings but are not considered borrowings
if the Fund maintains a segregated account; the use of these techniques
in connection with a segregated account may result in a Fund's
assets being 100 percent leveraged. See &quot;Appendix A - Techniques
Involving Leverage.&quot;<BR>

Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">When the Fund
purchases securities on margin, it only pays part of the purchase
price and borrows the remainder, typically from the Fund's broker.
As a borrowing, a</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Fund's
purchase of securities on margin is subject to the limitations
and risks described in &quot;Borrowing&quot; above. In addition,
if the value of the securities purchased on margin decreases such
that the Fund's borrowing with respect to the security exceeds
the maximum permissible borrowing amount, the Fund will be required
to make margin payments (additional payments to the broker to
maintain the level of borrowing at permissible levels). A Fund's
obligation to satisfy margin calls may require the Fund to sell
securities at an inappropriate time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Techniques Involving
Leverage</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold"> All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Utilization
of leveraging involves special risks and may involve speculative
investment techniques. The Funds may borrow for other than temporary
or emergency purposes, lend their securities, enter reverse repurchase
agreements, and purchase securities on a when issued or forward
commitment basis. In addition, certain funds may engage in dollar
roll transactions and Intermediate U.S. Government Fund may purchase
securities on margin and sell securities short (other than against
the box). Each of these transactions involve the use of &quot;leverage&quot;
when cash made available to the Fund through the investment technique
is used to make additional portfolio investments. In addition,
the use of swap and related agreements may involve leverage. The
Funds use these investment techniques only when the Adviser to
a Fund believes that the leveraging and the returns available
to the Fund from investing the cash will provide shareholders
a potentially higher return.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Leverage exists when a Fund achieves
the right to a return on a capital base that exceeds the Fund's
investment. Leverage creates the risk of magnified capital losses
which occur when losses affect an asset base, enlarged by borrowings
or the creation of liabilities, that exceeds the equity base of
the Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The risks of leverage include
a higher volatility of the net asset value of the Fund's shares
and the relatively greater effect on the net asset value of the
shares caused by favorable or adverse market movements or changes
in the cost of cash obtained by leveraging and the yield obtained
from investing the cash. So long as a Fund is able to realize
a net return on its investment portfolio that is higher than interest
expense incurred, if any, leverage will result in higher current
net investment income being realized by the Fund than if the Fund
were not leveraged. On the other hand, interest rates change from
time to time as does their relationship to each other depending
upon such factors as supply and demand, monetary and tax policies
and investor expectations. Changes in such factors could cause
the relationship between the cost of leveraging and the yield
to change so that rates involved in the lever-aging arrangement
may substantially increase relative to the yield on the obligations
in which the proceeds of the leveraging have been invested. To
the extent that the interest expense involved in leveraging approaches
the net return on the Fund's investment portfolio, the benefit
of leveraging will be reduced, and, if the interest expense on
borrowings were to exceed the net return to shareholders, the
Fund's use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return
than if the Fund were not leveraged. Similarly, the effect of
leverage in a declining market could be a greater decrease in
net asset value per share than if the Fund were not leveraged.
In an extreme case, if the Fund's current investment income were
not sufficient to meet the interest expense of leveraging, it
could be necessary for the Fund to liquidate certain of its investments
at an inappropriate time. The use of leverage may be considered
speculative.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Segregated Account. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">In
order to limit the risks involved in various transactions involving
leverage, the Trust's custodian will set aside and maintain in
a segregated account cash, U.S. Government Securities and other
liquid, high-grade debt securities in accordance with SEC guidelines.
The accounts value, which is marked to market daily, will be at
least equal to the Fund's commitments under these transactions.
The Fund's commitments may include (i) the Fund's obligations
to repurchase securities under a reverse repurchase agreement,
settle when-issued and forward commitment transactions and make
payments under a cap or floor (see &quot;Appendix A - Swap Agreements&quot;)
and (ii) the greater of the market value of securities sold short
or the value of the securities at the time of the short sale (reduced
by any margin deposit). The net amount of the excess, if any,
of a Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect to
each interest rate swap will be calculated on a daily basis and
an amount at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained
in the segregated account. If the Fund enters into an</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">interest rate swap on other
than a net basis, the Fund will maintain the full amount accrued
on a daily basis of the Fund's obligations with respect to the
swap in their segregated account. The use of a segregated account
in connection with leveraged transactions may result in a Fund's
portfolio being100 percent leveraged.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund's use of repurchase agreements,
securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements and forward
commitments (including dollar roll transactions) entails certain
risks not associated with direct investments in securities. For
instance, in the event that bankruptcy or similar proceedings
were commenced against a counterparty while these transactions
remained open or a counterparty defaulted on its obligations,
the Fund might suffer a loss. Failure by the other party to deliver
a security purchased by the Fund may result in a missed opportunity
to make an alternative investment. The Advisers monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties to these transactions and intend to enter into
these transactions only when they believe the counterparties present
minimal credit risks and the income to be earned from the transaction
justifies the attendant risks. Counterparty insolvency risk with
respect to repurchase agreements is reduced by favorable insolvency
laws that allow the Fund, among other things, to liquidate the
collateral held in the event of the bankruptcy of the counterparty.
Those laws do not apply to securities lending and, accordingly,
securities lending involves more risk than does the use of repurchase
agreements. As a result of entering forward commitments and reverse
repurchase agreements, as well as lending its securities, a Fund
may be exposed to greater potential fluctuations in the value
of its assets and net asset value per share. See &quot;Appendix
A - Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Repurchase Agreements - All
Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may enter
into repurchase agreements, transactions in which a Fund purchases
a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security
to the seller at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon future
date, normally 1 to 7 days later. The resale price of are purchase
agreement reflects a market rate of interest that is not related
to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security. The
Trust's custodian maintains possession of the collateral underlying
a repurchase agreement, which has a market value, determined daily,
at least equal to the repurchase price, and which consists of
the types of securities in which the Fund may invest directly.
International Portfolio and, with respect to the portion of their
assets managed in the International Fund style, Diversified Equity
Fund, Growth Equity Fund and each Balanced Fund, may enter into
repurchase agreements with foreign entities.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Securities Lending - All Funds.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may lend securities
from its portfolios to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions.
Securities loans must be continuously secured by cash or U.S.
Government Securities with a market value, determined daily, at
least equal to the value of the Fund's securities loaned, including
accrued interest. A Fund receives interest in respect of securities
loans from the borrower or from investing cash collateral. A Fund
may pay fees to arrange the loans. No Fund will lend portfolio
securities in excess of 33 1/3 percent of the value of the Fund's
total assets.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Reverse Repurchase Agreements
- Balanced Funds, Fixed Income Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, transactions
in which the Fund sells a security and simultaneously commits
to repurchase that security from the buyer at an agreed upon price
on an agreed upon future date. The resale price in a reverse repurchase
agreement reflects a market rate of interest that is not related
to the coupon rate or maturity of the sold security. For certain
demand agreements, there is no agreed upon repurchase date and
interest payments are calculated daily, often based upon the prevailing
overnight repurchase rate. Because certain of the incidents of
ownership of the security are retained by the Fund, reverse repurchase
agreements may be viewed as a form of borrowing by the Fund from
the buyer, collateralized by the security sold by the Fund. A
Fund will use the proceeds of reverse</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">repurchase agreements to
fund redemptions or to make investments. In most cases these investments
either mature or have a demand feature to resell to the issuer
on a date not later than the expiration of the agreement. Interest
costs on the money received in a reverse repurchase agreement
may exceed the return received on the investments made by the
Fund with those monies. Any significant commitment of a Fund's
assets to the reverse repurchase agreements will tend to increase
the volatility of the Fund's net asset value per share.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">When-Issued Securities and Forward
Commitments - All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may purchase fixed income securities on a &quot;when-issued&quot;
or &quot;forward commitment&quot; basis. When these transactions
are negotiated, the price, which is generally expressed in yield
terms, is fixed at the time the commitment is made, but delivery
and payment for the securities take place at a later date. Normally,
the settlement date occurs within 3 months after the transaction.
During the period between a commitment and settlement, no payment
is made for the securities purchased and no interest on the security
accrues to the purchaser. At the time a Fund makes a commitment
to purchase securities in this manner, the Fund immediately assumes
the risk of ownership, including price fluctuation. Failure by
the other party to deliver a security purchased by a Fund may
result in a loss or a missed opportunity to make an alternative
investment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The use of when-issued transactions
and forward commitments enables a Fund to hedge against anticipated
changes in interest rates and prices. If the Adviser or Schroder
were to forecast incorrectly the direction of interest rate movements,
however, a Fund might be required to complete these transactions
when the value of the security is lower than the price paid by
the Fund. Except for dollar-roll transactions, a Fund will not
purchase securities on a when-issued or forward commitment basis
if, as a result, more than 15 percent (35 percent in the case
of Total Return Bond Fund) of the value of the Fund's total assets
would be committed to such transactions.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">When-issued securities and forward
commitments may be sold prior to the settlement date, but the
Funds purchase securities on a when-issued and forward commitment
basis only with the intention of actually receiving the securities.
When-issued securities may include bonds purchased on a &quot;when,
and if issued&quot; basis under which the issuance of the securities
depends upon the occurrence of a subsequent event. Commitment
of a Fund's assets to the purchase of securities on a when-issued

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Dollar Roll Transactions - Balanced
Funds, Fixed Income Funds (except Ready Cash Investment Fund).
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may enter into
dollar roll transactions wherein the Fund sells fixed income securities,
typically mortgage-backed securities, and makes a commitment to
purchase similar, but not identical, securities at a later date
from the same party. Like a forward commitment, during the roll
period no payment is made for the securities purchased and no
interest or principal payments on the security accrue to the purchaser,
but the Fund assumes the risk of ownership. A Fund is compensated
for entering into dollar roll transactions by the difference between
the current sales price and the forward price for the future purchase,
as well as by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the
initial sale. Like other when-issued securities or firm commitment
agreements, dollar roll transactions involve the risk that the
market value of the securities sold by the Fund may decline below
the price at which a Fund is committed to purchase similar securities.
In the event the buyer of securities under a dollar roll transaction
becomes insolvent, the Fund's use of the proceeds of the transaction
may be restricted pending a determination by the other party,
or its trustee or receiver, whether to enforce the Fund's obligation
to repurchase the securities. The Funds will engage in roll transactions
for the purpose of acquiring securities for its portfolio and
not for investment leverage. Each Fund will limit its obligations
on dollar roll transactions to 35 percent of the Fund's net assets.

Balanced Funds, Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, Managed Fixed
Income Fund, Stable Income Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">To
manage its exposure to different types of investments, a Fund
may enter into interest rate, currency and mortgage (or other
asset) swap agreements and may purchase and sell interest rate
&quot;caps,&quot; &quot;floors&quot; and &quot;collars.&quot;
In a typical interest rate swap agreement, one party agrees to
make regular payments equal to a floating interest rate on a specified
amount (the &quot;notional principal</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">amount&quot;) in return
for payments equal to a fixed interest rate on the same amount
for a specified period. If a swap agreement provides for payment
in different currencies, the parties may also agree to exchange
the notional principal amount. Mortgage swap agreements are similar
to interest rate swap agreements, except that the notional principal
amount is tied to a reference pool of mortgages. In a cap or floor,
one party agrees, usually in return for a fee, to make payments
under particular circumstances. For example, the purchaser of
an interest rate cap has the right to receive payments to the
extent a specified interest rate exceeds an agreed upon level;
the purchaser of an interest rate floor has the right to receive
payments to the extent a specified interest rate falls below an
agreed upon level. A collar entitles the purchaser to receive
payments to the extent a specified interest rate falls outside
an agreed upon range.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Swap agreements may involve leverage
and may be highly volatile; depending on how they are used, they
may have a considerable impact on the Fund's performance. See
&quot;Appendix A - Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot; Swap agreements
involve risks depending upon the counterparties creditworthiness
and ability to perform as well as the Fund's ability to terminate
its swap agreements or reduce its exposure through offsetting
transactions. The Adviser monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties
to these transactions and intends to enter into these transactions
only when they believe the counterparties present minimal credit
risks and the income expected to be earned from the transaction

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Intermediate U.S. Government

to make short sales of securities it owns or has the right to
acquire at no added cost through conversion or exchange of other
securities it owns(referred to as short sales &quot;against the
box&quot;) and to make short sales of securities which it does
not own or have the right to acquire. A short sale that is not
made &quot;against the box&quot; is a transaction in which a Fund
sells a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline
in the market price for the security. When the Fund makes a short
sale, the proceeds it receives are retained by the broker until
the Fund replaces the borrowed security. In order to deliver the
security to the buyer, the Fund must arrange through a broker
to borrow the security and, in so doing, the Fund becomes obligated
to replace the security borrowed at its market price at the time
of replacement, whatever that price may be.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Short sales that are not made
&quot;against the box&quot; create opportunities to increase the
Fund's return but, at the same time, involve special risk considerations
and may be considered a speculative technique. Since the Fund
in effect profits from a decline in the price of the securities
sold short without the need to invest the full purchase price
of the securities on the date of the short sale, the Fund's net
asset value per share, will tend to increase more when the securities
it has sold short decrease in value, and to decrease more when
the securities it has sold short increase in value, than would
otherwise be the case if it had not engaged in such short sales.
Short sales theoretically involve unlimited loss potential, as
the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase,
although a Fund may mitigate such losses by replacing the securities
sold short before the market price has increased significantly.
Under adverse market conditions a Fund might have difficulty purchasing
securities to meet its short sale delivery obligations and might
have to sell portfolio securities to raise the capital necessary
to meet its short sale obligations at a time when fundamental
investment considerations would not favor those sales. See &quot;Appendix
A - Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">If the Fund makes a short sale
&quot;against the box&quot;, the Fund would not immediately deliver
the securities sold and would not receive the proceeds from the
sale. The seller is said to have a short position in the securities
sold until it delivers the securities sold, at which time it receives
the proceeds of the sale. The Fund's decision to make a short
sale &quot;against the box&quot; may be a technique to hedge against
market risks when the Adviser believes that the price of a security
may decline, causing a decline in the value of a security owned
by the Fund or a security convertible into or exchangeable for
such security. In such case, any future losses in the Fund's long
position would be reduced by an offsetting future gain in the
short position. The Fund's ability to enter into short sales transactions
is limited by certain tax requirements. See &quot;Dividends, Distributions

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Interests in mortgage-backed securities
differ from other forms of debt securities, which normally provide
for periodic payment of interest in fixed amounts with principal
payments at maturity or on specified call dates. In contrast,
mortgage-backed securities provide monthly payments which consist
of interest and, in most cases, principal. In effect, these payments
are a &quot;pass-through&quot; of the monthly payments made by
the individual borrowers on their mortgage loans, net of any fees
paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities or a mortgage
loan servicer. Additional payments to holders of these securities
are caused by prepayments resulting from the sale or foreclosure

of the mortgage instruments are generally uniform within a pool
but may vary among pools. For example, in addition to fixed-rate,
fixed-term mortgages, the Fund may purchase pools of variable
rate mortgages, growing equity mortgages, graduated payment mortgages
and other types. Mortgage servicers impose qualification standards
for local lending institutions which originate mortgages for the
pools as well as credit standards and underwriting criteria for
individual mortgages included in the pools. In addition, many
mortgages included in pools are insured through private mortgage
insurance companies.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Liquidity and Marketability.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The market for mortgage-backed
securities has expanded considerably in recent years. The size
of the primary issuance market and active participation in the
secondary market by securities dealers and many types of investors
make government and government-related pass-through pools highly
liquid. The recently introduced private conventional pools of
mortgages(pooled by commercial banks, savings and loan institutions
and others, with no relationship with government and government-related
entities) have also achieved broad market acceptance and consequently
an active secondary market has emerged. However, the market for
conventional pools is smaller and less liquid than the market

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Average Life and Prepayments.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The average life of
a pass-through pool varies with the maturities of the underlying
mortgage instruments. In addition, a pool's terms may be shortened
by unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on
the underlying mortgages. Prepayments with respect to securities
during times of declining interest rates will tend to lower the
return of a Fund and may even result in losses to a Fund if the
securities were acquired at a premium. The occurrence of mortgage
prepayments is affected by various factors including the level
of interest rates, general economic conditions, the location and
age of the mortgage and other social and demographic conditions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As prepayment rates of individual
pools vary widely, it is not possible to accurately predict the
average life of a particular pool. For pools of fixed-rate 30-year
mortgages, common industry practice is to assume that prepayments
will result in a 12-year average life. Pools of mortgages with
other maturities or different characteristics will have varying
assumptions for average life. The assumed average life of pools
of mortgages having terms of less than 30 years is less than 12
years, but typically not less than5 years.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Yield Calculations. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Yields
on pass-through securities are typically quoted by investment
dealers based on the maturity of the underlying instruments and
the associated average life assumption. In periods of falling
interest rates, the rate of prepayment tends to increase, thereby
shortening the actual average life of a pool of mortgages. Conversely,
in periods of rising rates, the rate of prepayment tends to decrease,
thereby lengthening the actual average life of the pool. Actual
prepayment experience may cause the yield to differ from the assumed
average life yield. Reinvestment of prepayments may occur at higher
or lower interest rates than the original investment, thus affecting
the yield of a Fund.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Adjustable Rate Mortgage-Backed
Securities. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Adjustable
rate mortgage-backed securities (&quot;ARMs&quot;) are securities
that have interest rates that are reset at periodic intervals,
usually by reference to some interest rate index or market interest
rate. Although the rate adjustment feature may act as a buffer
to reduce sharp changes in the value of adjustable rate securities,
these securities are still subject to changes in value based on
changes in market interest rates or changes in the issuer's creditworthiness.
Because of the resetting of interest rates, adjustable rate securities
are less likely than non-adjustable rate securities of comparable
quality and maturity to increase significantly in value when market
interest rates fall. Also, most adjustable rate securities (or
the underlying mortgages) are subject to caps or floors. &quot;Caps&quot;
limit the maximum amount by which the interest rate paid by the
borrower may change at each reset date or over the life of the
loan and, accordingly, fluctuation in interest rates above these
levels could cause such mortgage securities to &quot;cap out&quot;
and to behave more like long-term, fixed-rate debt securities.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">ARMs may have less risk of a decline
in value during periods of rapidly rising rates, but they may
also have less potential for capital appreciation than other debt
securities of comparable maturities due to the periodic adjustment
of the interest rate on the underlying mortgages and due to the
likelihood of increased prepayments of mortgages as interest rates
decline. Furthermore, during periods of declining interest rates,
income to a Fund will decrease as the coupon rate resets to reflect
the decline in interest rates. During periods of rising interest
rates, changes in the coupon rates of the mortgages underlying
a Fund's ARMs may lag behind changes in market interest rates.
This may result in a slightly lower net value until the interest
rate resets to market rates. Thus, investors could suffer some
principal loss if they sold Fund Shares before the interest rates
on the underlying mortgages were adjusted to reflect current market
rates.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Collateralized Mortgage Obligations.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Collateralized Mortgage
Obligations (&quot;CMOs&quot;) are debt obligations that are collateralized
by mortgages or mortgage pass-through securities issued by GNMA,</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">FHLMC or FNMA or by pools
of conventional mortgages (&quot;Mortgage Assets&quot;). CMOs
may be privately issued or U.S. Government Securities. Payments
of principal and interest on the Mortgage Assets are passed through
to the holders of the CMOs on the same schedule as they are received,
although, certain classes (often referred to as tranches) of CMOs
have priority over other classes with respect to the receipt of
payments. Multi-class mortgage pass-through securities are interests
in trusts that hold Mortgage Assets and that have multiple classes
similar to those of CMOs. Unless the context indicates otherwise,
references to CMOs include multi-class mortgage pass-through securities.
Payments of principal of and interest on the underlying Mortgage
Assets (and in the case of CMOs, any reinvestment income thereon)
provide funds to pay debt service on the CMOs or to make scheduled
distributions on the multi-class mortgage pass-through securities.
Parallel pay CMOs are structured to provide payments of principal
on each payment date to more than one class. These simultaneous
payments are taken into account in calculating the stated maturity
date or final distribution date of each class, which, as with
other CMO structures, must be retired by its stated maturity date
or final distribution date but may be retired earlier. Planned
amortization class mortgage-based securities(&quot;PAC Bonds&quot;)
are a form of parallel pay CMO. PAC Bonds are designed to provide
relatively predictable payments of principal provided that, among
other things, the actual prepayment experience on the underlying
mortgage loans falls within a contemplated range. If the actual
prepayment experience on the underlying mortgage loans is at a
rate faster or slower than the contemplated range, or if deviations
from other assumptions occur, principal payments on a PAC Bond
may be greater or smaller than predicted. The magnitude of the
contemplated range varies from one PAC Bond to another; a narrower
range increases the risk that prepayments will be greater or smaller
than contemplated. CMOs may have complicated structures and generally
involve more risks than simpler forms of mortgage- backed securities.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The final tranche of a CMO may
be structured as an accrual bond (sometimes referred to as a Z-tranche).
Holders of accrual bonds receive no cash payments for an extended
period of time. During the time that earlier tranches are outstanding,
accrual bonds receive accrued interest which is a credit for periodic
interest payments that increases the face amount of the security
at a compounded rate, but is not paid to the bond holder. After
all previous tranches are retired, accrual bond holders start
receiving cash payments that include both principal and continuing
interest. The market value of accrual bonds can fluctuate widely
and their average life depends on the other aspects of the CMO
offering. Interest on accrual bonds is taxable when accrued even
though the holders receive no accrual payment. The Funds distribute
all of their net investment income, and may have to sell portfolio
securities to distribute imputed income, which may occur at a
time when the Adviser would not have chosen to sell such securities

No Fund may invest more than 10 percent of its net assets in asset-backed

a financial institution. Asset-backed securities do not always
have the benefit of a security interest in collateral comparable
to the security interests associated with mortgage-backed securities.
As a result, the risk that recovery on repossessed collateral
might be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on asset-backed
securities is greater for asset-backed securities than for mortgage-backed

on the Adviser's ability to predict movements in the prices of
individual securities and fluctuations in the general securities
markets; (2) imperfect correlations between movements in the prices
of options or futures contracts and movements in the price of
the securities hedged or used for cover which may cause a given
hedge not to achieve its objective; (3) the fact that the skills
and techniques needed to trade these instruments are different
from those needed to select the other securities in which the
Fund invests; (4) lack of assurance that a liquid secondary market
will exist for any particular instrument at any particular time,
which, among other things, may hinder a Fund's ability to limit
exposures by closing its positions; (5) the possible need to defer

and exchange traded options contracts on fixed income securities.
Accordingly, hedging transactions involving these instruments
may entail &quot;cross-hedging.&quot; As an example, a Fund may
wish to hedge existing holdings of mortgage-backed securities,
but no listed options may exist on those securities. In that event,
the Adviser may attempt to hedge the Fund's securities by the
use of options with respect to similar fixed income securities.
The Fund may use various futures contracts that are relatively
new instruments without a significant trading history. As a result,
there can be no assurance that an active secondary market in those

call option is a contract pursuant to which the purchaser of the
call option, in return for a premium paid, has the right to buy
the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price
at any time during the term of the option. The writer of the call
option, who receives the premium, has the obligation upon exercise
of the option to deliver the underlying security against payment
of the exercise price during the option period. A put option gives
its purchaser, in return for a premium, the right to sell the
underlying security at a specified price during the term of the
option. The writer of the put, who receives the premium, has the
obligation to buy the underlying security, upon exercise at the
exercise price during the option period. The amount of premium
received or paid is based upon certain factors, including the
market price of the underlying security or index, the relationship
of the exercise price to the market price, the historical price
volatility of the underlying security or index, the option period,
supply and demand and interest rates.<BR>

stock index assigns relative values to the stock included in the
index, and the index fluctuates with changes in the market values
of the stocks included in the index. Stock index options operate
in the same way as the more traditional stock options except that
exercises of stock index options are effected with cash payments
and do not involve delivery of securities. Thus, upon exercise
of stock index options, the purchaser will realize and the writer
will pay an amount based on the differences between the exercise
price and the closing price of the stock index.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Index Futures Contracts. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Bond
and stock index futures contracts are bilateral agreements pursuant
towhich two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount
of cash equal to a specified dollar amount times the difference
between the bond or stock index value at the close of trading
of the contract and the price at which the futures contract is
originally struck. No physical delivery of the securities comprising
the index is made. Generally, these futures contracts are closed
out prior to the expiration date of the contract.<BR>

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Options on futures
contracts are similar to stock options except that an option on
a futures contract gives the purchaser the right, in return for
the premium paid, to assume a position in a futures contract rather
than to purchase or sell stock, at a specified exercise price
at anytime during the period of the option. Upon exercise of the
option, the delivery of the futures position to the holder of
the option will be accompanied by transfer to the holder of an
accumulated balance representing the amount by which the market
price of the futures contract exceeds, in the case of a call,
or is less than, in the case of a put, the exercise price of the
option on the future.<BR>
