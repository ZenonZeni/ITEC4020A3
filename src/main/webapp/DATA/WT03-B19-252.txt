Education and training
</H1>
Post-secondary education in Australia falls into two broad sectors - 
university, and vocational education and training.
<P>
Victoria's extensive university system undertakes teaching and research in the 
full range of professional and theoretical disciplines. University 
participation and graduation rates are higher in Victoria than in Australia 
as a whole, reflecting the State's strengths in knowledge and information-based 
industries.
<P>
University students who are permanent residents of Australia generally pay a 
Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) as a partial contribution to the 
cost of their education. HECS is payable when students enrol in each year 
of their course, or it may be deferred until such time as the students income 
exceeds a prescribed level. A means-test-based grants scheme, known as 
Austudy, is available to upper secondary and full time tertiary students 
who are Australian citizens or permanent residents of Australia.
<P>
The vocational education and training sector (also known in Victoria as the 
State Training System), is a major source of industrial skills and is also 
undergoing major expansion. TAFE (technical and further education) colleges 
provide training at professional, para-professional, post-trade, trade and 
operative levels. In addition, statewide accredited courses are also provided 
by more than 450 registered private providers (commercial colleges, industry 
and secondary colleges).
<P>
The Victorian State training system, backed by the Victorian Government, 
provides high quality training focused on the needs of industry and a 
changing economy. Of key importance in the Victorian TAFE system are Industry 
Training Boards, which advise the State Training Board and private providers 
on industry training needs and how training resources should be developed and 
delivered. The State Training Systems comprehensive resources are also applied 
in partnership with companies in Australia and overseas as well as with 
foreign governments to provide commercial training on a fee for service basis.
<P>
The fees charged at TAFE colleges vary depending upon the training required to 
meet individual client needs. All colleges charge a minimum enrolment 
and administration fee.
<P>
Overseas students may apply for full-fee places in approved courses at 
Victorian universities and TAFE colleges. On a full fee basis, economics, 
commerce, law and other classroom-based courses in universities cost 
between $8,000 and $12,000 per year. Laboratory-based courses, such as 
science, engineering and agriculture, cost between $11,000 and $20,000 a 
year.
<P>

<P>
Approximately three-quarters of students attend government schools which are 
generally co-educational and do not charge fees except for full-fee paying 
overseas students.
<P>
The annual fees for full-fee paying overseas students attending government 
schools are in the following range:
<UL>
<LI>$4,400 for primary school students;
<LI>$6,300 for junior secondary school students; and
<LI>$8,000 for senior secondary school students.
</UL>
In addition to the school systems conducted by the Victorian Government 
through the Directorate of School Education there are independent or private 
schools and the school system provided by the Catholic Education Office. The 
majority of the private schools are affiliated to religious groups. Fees for 
the independent schools vary between schools and range from $6,000 to $8,000. 
Most independent schools provide places for overseas students and boarding 
facilities which range in cost from $8,000 to $12,000. The annual fees for 
overseas students within the Catholic education system range from $3,000 
to $10,000.
<P>
An independent Board of Studies provides a rigorous curriculum framework from 
the Preparatory year to Year 12. The schools are responsible for the detailed 
design of the greater part of their curricula within that framework established 
by the Board. The Board administers the provision of awards for the Victorian 
Certificate of Education at Years 11 and 12 in all schools.
<P>
The International Baccalaureate is available in a number of independent and 
government schools.
<P>
The school year of four terms usually commences at the beginning of February 
and ends in December.
