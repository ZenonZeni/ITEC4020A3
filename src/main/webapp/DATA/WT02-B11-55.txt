<hr><b>In 1995, the Ministry of Education’s total expenditure on higher education amounted to DKK 8.5 billion, excluding student grants. <br>
In 1994, 128,000 students received DKK 3.6 billion in grants, and 58,900 took out study loans amounting to a total of approx. DKK 776 million.</b><hr><br>

The system of higher education is administered centrally by the Ministry of Education’s Department of Higher Education. <br>

Certain short, non-academic courses of education are administered by the Ministry of Education’s Department of Vocational Education and Training. <br>

Courses of education within such fields as art, architecture, librarianship and marine engineering are, however, placed under other ministeries. <br>
 
The system of higher education offers a great variety of choice. More than 130 institutions offer study programmes of varying lengths and levels. These institutions can be divided into: universities, university centres and other institutitions of higher education.<br>

This multiplicity of choice has been further strengthened by a significant development of the non-academic higher education system within the field of further commercial and technical education.<br>

In order to ensure coherence of policy across the broad range of higher education, 5 consultative bodies have been established to advise the Minister: The National Advisory Board for the Humanities, the National Advisory Board for Health Education, the National Advisory Board for the Natural Sciences, the National Advisory Board for Technology and the National Advisory Board for the Social Sciences. Each board consists of ten members appointed by the Minister.<br>
<br>
<b>Finance<br></b>
The system of higher education is financed by the Danish State. The institutions are, however, able to secure extra income through the offering of special courses and the sale of know- how. <br>

The cost to the Danish State of a graduate from a higher education institution averages from DKK 270,000 (social sciences) to DKK 725,000 (medicine).<br>

In 1994, a new financing system was implemented in higher education. The main principles of the new system are among other things that the institutions are awarded a lump sum grant’, and that they are  free to make their own priorities between the different departments and between education and research.<br>

The lump sum grant will consist of the following calculation elements<br>
 - the same initial amount for each institution.<br>
- a taximeter  grant per active student (according to the principle of ‘the money follows the student’). There are 12 different taximeter’ levels.<br>
     <br>
<b>Administration<br></b>
The great variety of institutions is reflected in a variety of institutional statutes. Universities, university centres and the other higher education institutions with university status are, however, subject to the same Parliamentary Act (from 1992).<br>

The Rector, who is elected for a period of 4 years from among the permanent full-time academic staff, has the formal responsibility for the management of the institution and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the institution.<br>

The Senate is the supreme collegiate body of the institution. It safeguards the interests of the institution in matters relating to education and research. It establishes guidelines for the long-term planning and devel-opment and approves the budget. It consists of 14 members. The Rector is its ex officio chairman. 2 of the members come from outside the university. They must be competent in matters relating to research and higher education.<br>
<br>
The next level,  the faculty,  is run by an elected dean. The faculty council establishes guidelines for the long-term planning and approves the budget of the faculty. This council also has 2 members from outside the university. <br>
<br>
A study committee consisting of an equal number of teachers and students is set up for each study programme. <br>
<br>
Research and related activities are normally placed with departments (institutes). Each department elects a head of department and a departmental board. <br>

The new Act of 1992 has increased the autonomy of the universities and other higher education institutions with university status, mainly economically, and it has made it easier to see who is responsible for the decision-making and the taking up of new tasks. The procedures within the universities etc. have furthermore been simplified.<br>
<br>
<b>The Institutions <br>
and the Courses Offered<br></b>
Universities and university centres offer courses and carry out research in traditional academic disciplines.<br>

As a rule, a university course now consists of a 3-year programme leading to a Bachelor’s degree, followed by a 2-year programme leading to a Master’s degree. In most cases, a degree subject is a self-contained structure, and the students choose their degree subjects at the commencement of their studies.<br>
<br>
3 years of supervised postgraduate studies lead to the Ph.D. degree.<br>
Independent research leading to a doctor’s degree proper often takes 5 to 8 years.<br>
<br>
The degree programmes offered by Roskilde University begin with a 2-year and those offered by Aalborg University with a 1-year basic course, which qualifies students for a number of further courses of study  characterized by an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented approach.<br>

The other university-level higher education institutions carry out research and offer education within areas such as engineering, veterinary science, pharmacy, architecture, music, art and in various business-related subjects.<br>
The colleges of education train teachers for the Danish Folkeskole 
and have their own independent research institution: The Royal Danish School of Educational Studies.<br>
<br>
The non-academic institutions offer short and medium-cycle courses, especially within the areas of technology, education, social work and health.<br>
<br>
<b>Admission<br></b>
In Denmark, the entrance qualifications for higher education are: the Upper Secondary School-Leaving Examination, the Higher Preparatory  Examination (HF), the Higher Commercial Examination (HHX) and the Higher Technical Examination (HTX).<br>

Certain non-academic institutions may however admit students who do not have any of these qualifications. Alternative requirements may be 910 years of school attendance, followed by work experience, an entrance examination or a supplementary examination.<br>

In 1995, approx. 40,000  young  people were admitted to higher education, and in 1996, there will be 43,500 study places available. There will only be restricted admission at very few courses, e.g. medicine.<br>
<br>
<b>In Denmark, there are no tuition fees in higher education. <br></b>

The places are divided into two quota systems. The places in the  first quota are distributed to applicants with a Danish qualifying examination, in accordance with the marks obtained in the leaving examination.<br>

The places in the second quota are accorded to other applicants, who  either meet the admission requirements or are found likely to be able to complete the course for which they have applied.<br>

Applicants with an international/foreign qualifying examination are also accepted through this quota. All applicants in the second quota are individually assessed by the institution.<br>

An upper limit may be set for the admission of non-Danish citizens. The limit does not, however, apply to EU-citizens and refugees.<br>
 
All applicants who are to be admitted through the second quota must apply for admission before 15 March with a view to starting in September of the same year.<br>
<br>
<b>The Academic Year, <br></b>
Length of Terms, Degrees, etc.<br>
The academic year is divided into two terms: from September to December and from January/February to May/June. Students have a week’s holiday in October, at Christmas and at Easter.<br>

Bachelor’s degrees can now be obtained within many of the universities’ main areas after 3 years of study. Another two years of study lead to the award of a Master’s degree (cand. mag., cand. scient., etc.)<br>

In the Humanities, there is also a special 6-year degree course leading to the degree of mag.art.<br>

Most courses of study leading to the award of a Master’s degree are prescribed to take 5 years. In most courses of study, the tendency has been for students to exceed the prescribed time, but in recent years this tendency has been increasingly reversed.<br>

The designations of the research degrees proper are the Ph.D.degree and the doctoral degree (dr. phil., dr.scient. etc.), which is the highest academic degree.<br>
<br>
At most examinations - and all final examinations - there are external examiners.<br>
<br>
<b>Marking<br></b>
Marks are given according to the 13point marking scale.<br>
<br>
Marks 10-13 are given for the excellent performance, 7-9 for the good performance, 6 for the satisfactory performance, and 0-5 for the poor performance.<br>
<br>
<b>Research<br></b>
Publicly financed research, which constitutes approx. 45% of the research carried out in Denmark, takes place partly at the higher education institutions and partly at the so-called government research institutions. <br>

The higher education institutions decide themselves what research 
is to be undertaken. The collegiate bodies decide on the distribution of research funding and research commitments among departments and staff. <br>

The designations of appointments are structured as follows: assistant professor (limited tenure, normally <br>
3 years), associate professor and full professor. These appointments require as a minimum qualifications at Ph.D. level. <br>
<br>
All categories of appointment carry both a research and a teaching commitment. The proportional amount of time to be devoted to research and teaching is not regulated by legislation or agreement.<br>

The resources and annual manhours available for research appear from the Appropriations Act of the year. The Ministry draws up separate budgets for research and teaching, which means that research grants can in principle be maintained unchanged, even though teaching grants are adjusted.<br>

The amount of research carried out therefore varies from institution to institution and from main area to main area.<br>
<br>
<b>Postgraduate Studies<br></b>
Danish postgraduate studies are at present undergoing considerable development, as higher priority is being given to Ph.D. programmes at all universities and other institutions of higher education.<br>
 
All Danish postgraduate studies are internationally oriented. From 1993, the extent of the Ph.D. programme corresponds to three years of study mostly based on a completed Master’s degree. The research student will typically be integrated in two or more active research groups or networks, preferably also abroad, participate in courses corresponding to 6 months, and carry out an independent research project ending with a thesis.<br>
<br>
<b>Evaluation of Higher Education<br></b>
In order to ensure quality in higher education, the Ministry of Education has established the independent institution, the Centre for the Evaluation of Higher Education. The tasks of the Centre are<br>
-     to initiate evaluation of higher education in Denmark;<br>
-     to develop appropriate methods of assessing programmes;<br>
-    to inspire and guide the higher education institutions in aspects<br>
   relating to evaluation and quality control;<br>
-        to compile national and international experience regarding the evaluation of education systems and quality development.<br>
     <br>
A substantial part of the Centre’s work consists in regular and systematic evaluations of programmes on a rotating basis, by which all programmes will be evaluated within a period of five to seven years.<br>

In addition, the Centre evaluates new programmes after an initial
period, and programmes for which the relevant partners find that there is a need for an evaluation of the quality of the programme.<br>
<br>
<b>Open Education<br></b>
Open education is an offer of vocationally qualifying part-time education for adults. <br>

State grants cover approx. 80% of the costs of open education. The institutions themselves set the tuition fees, which typically range from DKK 1000 to DKK 1500 per subject per term.<br>

Employers wishing to purchase open education as part of a staff training programme are, however, required to pay the full cost.<br>

Open education is offered on a single subject basis at the institutions where the corresponding full-time courses are taught.<br>

Examinations are held with external evaluation. A pass can be transferred as a credit to the corresponding fulltime course of education.<br>
Admission requirements are the same as for full-time courses, but non-academic qualifications may be given considerable weight with respect to admission to open education, if there are more applicants than available study places.<br>

The institutions offer courses in for example modern languages, natural sciences and business studies, and each year the number of courses increases.<br>
<br> 
<b>Internationalization<br></b>
The Danish system of higher education is being increasingly influenced by international developments in all fields.<br>

A growing number of Danish students take part or the whole of their education abroad, and more and more foreign students are coming to Denmark  both as guest students under international exchange programmes such as ERASMUS, COMETT and TEMPUS and as regular students.<br>

It is expected that in 1995/96 the ERASMUS-programme alone will arrange for the exchange of approx. 2500 Danish students with a corresponding number of EU students. The teacher exchange is also on the increase.<br>

The NORDPLUS-programme has further strengthened the already well developed Nordic cooperation on teacher and student exchanges.<br>

The language of instruction at the higher education institutions is for the most part Danish, and intensive Danish courses are offered to foreign students who have been admitted to higher education courses. An increasing number of courses are however held in foreign languages, mainly in English. Many postgraduate courses are also held in foreign languages.<br>
<br>
<b>Student Unions<br></b>
Students are represented in the governing bodies of the institutions. Election to a governing body takes place through nomination via the students’ political organisations, which at the national level are associated in umbrella organisations. The
largest of these are the Joint Council of Danish Students (Danske Studerendes Fællesråd - DSF), the National Union of Moderate Students (Landssammenslutningen af Moderate Studerende - LMS), the Student Council of the Danish Engineering Colleges (Studierådet ved Danske Teknika) and the National Council of Students at the Colleges of Education (Lærerstuderendes Landssektion).<br>
