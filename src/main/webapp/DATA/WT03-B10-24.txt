      CENTREGOLD AND SEGA SEE SHORT FUTURE FOR CARTRIDGES

Centregold has issued a trading statement blaming a 23% decline
on lean demand for 16-bit cartridges but it said larger companies
such as Sega have suffered even greater losses.

Centregold Plc's trading statement on the six months to January
31 said the company's turnover had dropped 23% to GBP41m, leading
to a pre-tax loss of GBP3.6m, GBP2.9m of which came from stock
provisions.

Geoff Brown, Centregold's chief executive, believes his
announcement is the visible tip of a much larger iceberg,
claiming Sega Enterprises Ltd dropped 2m units before Christmas.
"Anything sold below GBP29.99 was sold below cost," he said.

Sega could not confirm losses but did admit that market response
had presented problems for the company recently. Mark Maslowicz,
Sega's UK software manager, said the delays would give cartridges
a life of little more than two years.

Centregold operates from US, UK, France, Germany and Japan,
incorporating publishers US Gold and Core Design, the budget
software label, KIXX, and the software research and development
company, Silicon Dreams, which has exclusive rights to the
Olympics '96.

Following the statement, Brown said the lack of dynamism in the
games cartridge industry could force it to give way to CD-ROM.

According to Brown, the three months it takes to order, assemble
and distribute games cartridges means that players cannot respond
to the upswing or inertia of the market. As a result, businesses
may fail to supply an eager market in time or have shelves piled
with unwanted products. "You put your finger in the air," he
said, "and see how it goes."

The company's San Francisco outlet has taken the largest hit and
is already moving towards PC CD-ROM, which takes one to two weeks
to get onto the shelves giving a high, cheap turnover for a near-
guaranteed market.

The lack of dynamics in the market has meant that promises of 64-
bit machines has kept customers waiting for their next purchase.
As one observer asked, "would you buy a TV today if you knew a 3D
TV was going to be out next year?"

Centregold had GBP430,000 in 16-bit machines on the books at the
end of last year and has been forced to drop its sell-on price
from GBP17 to GBP5 to shift GBP350,000 since then.

Analysts say they had been expecting losses for some time
although broker firm Smith New Court still predicts profits in
1996. Durlacher believes the time to earnings is closer to three
years and investments should not be earnings-based for at least
12-18 months.

Centregold's Geoff Brown believes the company has come out
"unscathed" but this year he is setting his sights on selling
40,000 units of the company's new football title, Fever Pitch,
compared with sales of 300,000 units of the World Cup cartridge
last year.

"In about two years the money made on CDs will exceed the money
made on cartridges," he said. "Admittedly, CD drives cost more
but cartridges cost more than CDs. In an ideal world everything
would be on CD."

Centregold's Geoff Brown sees the cartridge waning in
manufacturers' popularity. "16-bit cartridge is dead," he said.
"We've two more products then we'll leave it."

          INTEL SPELLS OUT NEW COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
                  TO DODGE HESITANT AUTHORITIES

As the US vice president vows to open telecoms markets, Intel
executives have warned that Europe's restrictive telecoms
legislation will motivate computer users to open new
communications pathways via the Internet.

In an exclusive interview with Multimedia Futures, Claude
Leglise, Intel Corp's worldwide director of multimedia, warned
that citizens would soon find new ways of communicating if
governments continued to avoid deregulation of the telecoms
networks.

Vice President Al Gore told ministers at the Group of Seven
information technology conference on February 25, "whether by new
law or new legislation we intend to open foreign investment in
telecommunications services in the United States."

The statement was backed by AT&T chief executive, Robert Allen,
who said, "if the dominant telecoms operators of Europe are to
become self-sufficient, profitable companies, they need the
stimulus of a truly competitive market.

According to Leglise, high charges for ISDN lines are "an
artefact of government regulation". He highlighted the difference
between the computer business and the telecoms business as one in
which the first is impatient to find new ways to expand, the
other loaded with legislation.

"One is right," he said, "the other is... not right."
"Deregulation of communications services is what will make this
thing grow. In North America the cable companies want to get into
the phone business and the phone companies want to get into the
video business. If none of these guys do anything, let me propose
that the computer industry and the computer users will start
creating their own (telecoms) network using Internet."

February saw the birth of at least two Internet telephone
companies: VocalTec Inc in tel Aviv, Israel (mf issue 2) and
Electric Magic Co in San Francisco (mf issue 3). Digital
Equipment Corporation has also said it will market its own
Internet phone by June and Cirrus Logic Inc has expressed an
interest in licensing VocalTec's software.

Although the software is still in its early stages, Leglise said
it is only a matter of a few years before the Internet, with an
infrastructure already laid and waiting for the innovation,
becomes a cheap alternative to the telephone companies.

He is critical of authorities for not responding to the
situation. "There was a time when the buggy manufacturers were
not worried about cars. It took 25 years but ultimately they
should have been worried" he said. "There's a large history of
small companies that became big. Intel is one of them, Microsoft
is another. What I'm saying is, it's pretty much inevitable."

"The question really is will the authorities provide a framework
that will make it happen quickly or not. What they can influence
is really the pace, but not the outcome."

             BERTLESMANN BATTLES MICROSOFT NETWORK

In a bid to pre-empt Microsoft Network, Frankfurt, Germany-based
media giant, Bertelsmann AG has paid $50m for a 5% stake in
America Online.

Bertelsmann has an option to increase its stake to 10% of the
Reston, Virginia-based company  while both will set up an
equally-owned European online joint venture. The target is 1m
subscribers  and $685m annual turnover by 2000. The new service
is planned to begin in Frankfurt in six weeks.

The companies are inviting  would-be European partners, at least
one per country to take small stakes of not more than 10% in the
new venture.

       VIEWCALL SEEKS GBP700,000 FOR FRACTAL STILL VIDEO

Interactive Online system provider, Viewcall Europe Plc of
London, wants to raise GBP700,000 via an offer of shares for
subscription and will apply to trade its stock on the London
Stock Exchange under Rule 4.2.

Viewcall was established at the end of last year and is currently
the sole licensee of the Viewcall interactive on-line system,
which uses fractal compression at the host end.

If it raises the GBP700,000 it wants, it will be capitalised at
GBP4.8m. Rule 4.2 allows a company to be traded on a matched
bargain basis with no fixed price or market maker for shares. The
fractal technology the company uses has been pioneered by Walzer
Corp of Jersey over the past two years.

Viewcall will use the money raised to fund trials of its end to
end system that enables VHS quality still pictures to be passed
across the telephone network at speeds that make it fast enough
for on-line catalogue shopping, for example. The set-top box
decoder in the home then decompresses those images for the
customer.

The decision on the location of the trial will be made in the
next six to eight weeks from a shortlist of three locations and
should be live in the third or early fourth quarter. Walzer
currently holds the largest stake in Viewcall and shareholders
number around 50; broker is London-based Astaire & Partners Ltd.

The company has yet to confirm details of the manufacturer of the
systems and is holding back information on the details of the
hardware and software until this is finalised.

            TOSHIBA LAUNCHES 32-BIT R3900 RISC CORE
                 FOR SET-TOPS AND HAND-HELD PDAs

Toshiba America Components Inc has launched a 32-bit R3900 RISC
processor core for applications such as television set-top boxes
and Personal Digital Assistants, claiming it achieves R4000-class
performance with 52.5 Dhrystone MIPS and power dissipation of
about 400mW at 50MHz.

The company has also built the core which it makes under licence
from MIPS Technologies Inc, into Southern Cross, which it
describes as a stand-alone microprocessor that enables users to
evaluate the R3900 and shorten time-to-market.

The 3900 offers variable instruction cache and data cache sizes
and parameters and includes on-board power management functions.
The part is also aimed at multimedia applications, facsimile
modems, games, laser printer controllers and X-terminals.

The R3900 is the first RISC microprocessor that was fully
specified by the Toshiba San Jose facility and was jointly
designed with Toshiba's engineering facility in Kawasaki.

The engineers took the standard R3000 architecture and designed
it into a 26 square millimetre part with 4Kb instruction and 1Kb
data cache, giving it the MIPS I+ enhanced instruction set and a
modified five-stage pipeline structure.

The set adds built-in branch-likely instructions that eliminate
the no operation instructions from the program flow for more
compact code, and there is a built-in one-cycle Multiplier and
Accumulation operation to reduce the multiplication and addition
functions into a single operation to provide signal processor-
like functions to enhances graphics and communications
capabilities.

The part runs off a 3.3V supply. Green Hills Software Inc will
supply C/C++ compiler, assembler, linker, library tools and
debugger and Hewlett-Packard Co is helping Toshiba with an on-
chip software debug module.

Samples of the Southern Cross - the TMPR3901F - will be offered
later in May, with volume set for the third quarter. Toshiba is
expecting processor prices to be $30 in 1,000-up quantities.

          THRUGLASS FOLLOWS FAO SCHWARZ WITH FACTURA

Following its success with FAO Schwarz, MicroTouch Systems Inc
has acquired the information kiosk housings maker, Factura
Composites Inc of Rochester, New York, on undisclosed terms.

The success of the New York toy store's multimedia touch
sensitive window display at Christmas prompted FAO Schwarz to
introduce trials of  Methuen, Massachusetts-based Microtouch
Systems Inc's Thruglass product in seven of its flagship stores
in the US.

Schwarz customers were able to touch, through 2" thick glass, a
picture of a toy that interested them and set off a digital video
demonstration of that toy on a 20" monitor.

This "kiosk through glass" system, the Targa Windowshopper, was
developed by Berlin, Connecticut-based Targa Systems Corp, and is
based on a Toshiba multimedia PC and Methuen, Massassechusetts-
based Microtouch's projected capacitive technology which enables
proprietary sensors to project  a low-voltage field through glass
or any other non-conductive material. Thruglass TouchPads - three
different sizes from 1" by 1" to 4" by 3" - can be affixed to the
back of photos or graphics  on the inside of a store window.

When a person outside touches the glass minute changes in the
voltage field are detected by the Thruglass controller, which
passes the selection to the computer. Sound is also available
with the system as is a sixteen pad keyboard.

The beauty of the system is its low-cost - just $500 for the
Thruglass equipment - to which must be added the price of a 486
PC and authoring software to develop a demonstration.

                CNET CELEBRATES DIAMOND JUBILEE
                WITH FIBRE-OPTIC 140Mbps ATM LINK

The Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET)
France's $500m national research giant, celebrated its fiftieth
anniversary in Paris by demonstrating France's Telecom's first
140Mbps fibre optic point-to-point Asynchronous Transfer link
with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG's CNET equivalent in
Darmstadt.

CNET announced its research targets over the next five years will
be technologies that will affect "planet telecommunications"
Asynchronous Transfer Mode - a technology it pioneered -
multimedia services, whether they be revamped PC versions of
Minitel or interactive cable television systems, mobile systems
and intelligent agents for filtering data from mobile or fixed
on-line services.

It is currently working to upgrade its Minitel viewdata services
for mail order, medical services, tourism, encyclopaedic and
educational sectors in France.

Michel Feneyrol, director of CNET said: "Between 26% and 30% of
the services we have now will be interested in having images
added and in more sophisticated, multimedia version of their
services."

Services using fixed images will appear on personal computers
between now and 2000, while services with moving images on
personal computers or televisions will appear by the turn of the
century, he added.

CNET and the national telecomms provider France Telecom, are
focusing on developing new on-line services and systems for
billing and network access, which they have perfected in 10 years
through operating the Minitel viewdata system.

Overall, Feneyrol believes that CNET will most probably
concentrate its R&D in software because "we see productivity with
software engineering tools growing much more slowly than, say,
the capacity of fibre optics".

France Telecom demonstrated the results of its partnership with
General Magic Inc on the use of intelligent agents to improve
user interfaces for telematic services.

"Our strategy, with General Magic is to add the nomadic dimension
to Teletel," said Jacques Guichard, associate director at CNET in
charge of multimedia.

The first market experiments using intelligent agents are
scheduled for next year. The applications, using personal
communicators from Sony Corp and Motorola Inc., are being
developed by France Telecom, General magic Inc and Philips PACE.
Gateways enable the communicators to interrogate existing Teletel
databases such as those of the national railway and highway
authorities.

Many of the CNET's development projects are currently being
exhibited as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, at the
Science City in Parc de la Villette, Paris until May 28.

         WHIRLPOOL DEMOS COOK-ON-DEMAND VOICE KITCHEN

The 'kitchen of the future' will cook on demand when Whirlpool
installs Voice Powered Technology's VoiceLogic technology in
kitchen applicances, but it will not allow you to shout at it.

The KitchenAid division of Whirlpool Corp has demonstrated speech
recognition in an oven, a refrigerator, a dishwasher and a
washing machine at the National Association of Home Builders
annual convention in Houston, Texas.

Whirlpool is currently reviewing the possibilities of using the
speech recognition technology from Canoga Park, California-based
Voice Powered Technology Inc. Whirlpool will not set a date for
KitchenAid Voice Command products to hit the shops until it has
fully evaluated the potential demand.

Speech recognition is about 97% accurate but still requires users
to press a button before speaking the commands. Voice Powered
Technology said there is still no reliable method for removing
background noise from the audio input.

"You can't just go into a room and yell at it," said a
spokesperson.

The system requires a short training session by each 'kitchen
user' who speaks around 30 words into the microphone. Then, in
the case of an oven, cooks can speak keywords like "prime rib",
"eight pounds" and "six pm", leaving the calculations to the
appliance.

Voice Powered Technology said it has been "looking to license to
home products for some time". A ten year old company with
revenues of $3.8m, it reported restructure losses of $290,000 in
December 1994 against a 1993 loss of $3.1m .

The company signed an OEM deal with Kong Wah Video Co Ltd in
April 1993. Kong Wah Video will use the technology in its Voice
Wand, a television remote control that operates with speech.
It has two other speech products: VCR Voice Programmer and Voice
Organizer, which retail at $99 and $199 respectively.

               AMERITECH WIRES 6M WITHOUT TRIALS

Interactive television is well known enough to install without
trials, according to DEC, which is supplying Alpha-based servers
to Ameritech's installation of 6m homes in Chicago.

Chicago-based Baby Bell, Ameritech Corp awarded the $475m
contract jointly to Digital Equipment Corp, Scientific Atlanta
Inc and ADC Telecommunications Inc and Ameritech is planning to
connect up to 300,000 homes in its five largest cities
immediately, rising to 1m by the end of the year. The company
hopes to have 6m - almost half the company's 13m subscribers -
using interactive television by 2001.

It is usual for companies to install a small number, often less
than 3000, to test the technology and marketing prospects of
interactive television in the area.

DEC said the technology was so well known now that it made little
sense to meander into the technology, particularly as the cabling
infrastructure had to be upgraded anyway.

"There's nothing really substantial to be gained from a trial,"
said a spokesperson. "Ameritech and other regional Bell companies
are already spending billions on new infrastructure. They might
as well go right ahead and install media servers."

The contract is worth $40m to Digital and $400m to Scientific
Atlanta which will supply analogue and digital set-top terminals
and remote controls. The remaining balance went to ADC
Telecommunications which got a six-year contract worth up to $35m
for cabinets placed in neighbourhoods to house the link between
the fibre-optic network and coaxial cables running to
subscribers' homes.

Nynex Corp, which is also using DEC and Scientific Atlanta, is
playing safer with a 2,500 installation in three apartment blocks
on Manhattan Island.

The company plans to expand quickly now that it has Federal
Communications Commission approval. It said it does not consider
Manhattan to be a trial but a starting point.

Nynex recently won its application for trading video services
within its own catchment area under the FCC rule 2.14 (mf issue
2). The rule has allowed telephone companies to supply video
services to their own telephone customers since 1992 providing
they obtain permission from the FCC.

DEC also said that even though the technology was solid enough to
build an infrastructure straight off, there were still
developments to be made that would bring the cost of installation
down.

"It's not as if there's no more innovation to go. It's just a
question of cost-reducing innovation," said the company's
spokesperson.

                   INFOMERCIALS DEBUT IN UK

Infomercials have begun in Europe for the first time as UK
companies fight for growing advertising revenues and Carlton
secures Children's ITV as its first customer for the SpotPlus
interactive commercial.

Carlton TV, part of Carlton Communications, is the UK's largest
independent television company since it bought Birmingham's
Central TV less than a year ago. Carlton hopes the initiative can
keep it ahead of Granada TV, the UK's number two. Advertising
revenues are forecast by to grow 6% this year.

Infomercials have been operating in the US for two years now by
television companies such as CBS and this is the first
introduction to Europe.

SpotPlus is a way for advertisers to add more information about a
product by screening extended details at 5.30 in the morning. A
number is displayed with the main advert and, by keying this
number into a VideoPlus remote control, the viewer sets their
video recorder to record the early morning commercial
when air-time costs are at their lowest.

SpotPlus infomercials cost GBP9,000 for the three and a half
minute slot compared with up to GBP1m in prime-time.

Children's ITV Interactive magazine (CITV), an interactive
television programme, is the first advertiser to make use of the
infomercial slot, which has been on trial since November last
year. The extended portion of the commercial will demonstrate how
to access the programme using a PC and a modem and offers a
chance to win a Compaq Presario 520.

Martin Bowley, managing director of sales at Carlton UK, sees
this as an opportunity for companies such as travel firms and car
manufacturers to use prime-time advertising space for brief
commercials which will include pointers to more in-depth
information.

            NTL PROMISES TERRESTRIAL DIGITAL TV ON
                 CONVENTIONAL SETS IN UK BY 1997

NTL, claiming the world's most ambitious terrestrial broadcasting
project, is promising UK viewers 12 digital channels using normal
television sets and aerials by 1997.

National Transcommunications Ltd was the engineering arm of
Independent Television (ITV) before being privatised in 1991 and
currently has a turnover of around GBP115m. It claims 30% of the
world market for video compression products other than
transmission equipment.

Based on MPEG-2 video compression, digital television is claimed
to improve the quality of broadcast signals and permit television
companies to offer services such as interactive programming and
wide screen TV. The broadcast quality of digital television
enables television to compete more equally with cable and
satellite.

NTL said the digital system will adhere to normal television
equipment as much as possible, adding a GBP300 set-top unit to
decode the digital signals to a conventional stereo PAL colour TV
signal. It expects the project to cost "tens of millions" of
pounds.

The digital broadcast started at the end of February on
757.25MHz, known as UHF Channel 34, carrying four additional
programmes in digital format in place of the normal PAL channel.

Reuters reports that NTL's plans throw down the gauntlet to the
UK government and its state-funded British Broadcasting
Corporation. In its June 1994 White Paper, the government linked
the introduction of digital broadcasting to the privatisation of
the BBC transmission network.

NTL does not want to be relegated to second place because of
delays in broadcast legislation, causing it to lose leverage
against cable companies, already in reach of 4.4m homes in the
UK.

"Above all, we ask that the BBC must not be given a favoured
position," said NTL chief executive, Andy Sukawaty.

NTL has already offered to provide digital transmission of the
BBC's channels and is waiting its reply. It has already expressed
an interest in buying the BBC's transmission arm when it is
privatised, claiming it could make savings of up to #20m by
combining the assets of the two companies.

Digital transmission could bring back Channel Five, a station
which was to use channel 35 in the TV spectrum but was rejected
by the broadcasting industry because companies licensing the
channel would have to pay several million of pounds to convert or
re-tune customer's VCRs.

The reintroduction of Channel Five could improve the chances of
regional and minority broadcasts.

           UNIONS THREATEN GERMAN TELECOMS EXPANSION

German unions have threatened strike action if Deutsche Telekom's
modernisation continues to threaten jobs, even if it means
damping down the country's telecommunications explosion.

The German public telecommunications operator is planning to
install six interactive television trials in Berlin, Hamburg,
Koln, Leibzig, Neurenberg and Stuttgart by the end of the year.

Union pressure adds to existing concerns as to whether the
company will find enough technologies for the trials.

Deutsche Telekom has said it needs to become more efficient in
order to become internationally competitive, announcing plans to
double job cuts to 60,000 by the year 2000. After a meeting
between union officials and the phone company's management board,
Kurt van Haaren, chairman of the German Postal Workers Union
(DPG), said he was dismayed at the job cuts.

Deutsche Telekom's objective is to test different technologies
for delivering interactive on-line services at each site.
Participants and analysts believe open-ended licensing will build
an unpredictable market but that this unpredictability is
necessary for innovation in the industry.

Invitations are still open to participate in the trials but some
industry observres are dubious whether enough choices exist.

Michael Gell, of British Telecommunications Plcs, said companies
would have to guess their way through the coming years of
regulations.

            ACORN LOSSES FORCE CALL FOR GBP17M CASH

Acorn Computer Group Plc of Cambridge, England accompanied year-
end figures showing a loss of GBP34m with a GBP17m cash call to
fund its Online Media division.

Online Media requires further significant investment as the
directors do not envisage large scale exploitation of the
interactive multimedia market until 1997 at the earliest. Online
Media is the preferred supplier of Northern Telecom Ltd for
television set-top boxes for trials in the UK and the rest of
Europe.

It warned that there were considerable risks attached to Acorn's
entry into the interactive television market.

Acorn's principal shareholder, Ing C Olivetti & Co SpA will not
be taking up its entitlement in the issue. Its shares will be
placed with institutional shareholders, reducing Olivetti's stake
to 58.9% from 78.5%. The balance of the proceeds will be used to
support the core business, Acorn Computers Ltd, after a diffcult
year.

               PERSONAL COMMUNICATORS TO SUPPLY
               WIRELESS VIDEO IN FIVE YEARS' TIME

Wireless personal communications will include video multimedia
within five years, according to industry executives who expect
wireless ATM by 2000.

Reuters reports that telecommunications officials expect business
users and consumers to turn to wireless personal communicators to
use interactive services across the world within five years.

Speaking at a telecommunications conference in February, Leif
Kallan, chairman of Sweden's Telefon AB, said, "voice telephony
is not enough. The ultimate standard should be radio ATM. We
believe this can be brought to market by the year 2000."

ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a high bandwidth networking
protocol that is vaunted by interactive multimedia companies as a
prerequisite technology for sending high volumes of data along
network wires. It is used by telephone carriers and large
companies who need capacities up to 65 times those of
conventional networks such as ethernet, and has not yet reached
the desktop.

Mobile phones and pagers are the most common wireless devices and
Reuters reports that industry consultants, Frost and Sullivan
Inc, project the worldwide market for personal communication
services and handsets worldwide will grow from $88m in 1993 to
over $8,000m by 2000, rising to $19,000m by 2002.

"Wireless is the fastest-growing segment of the
telecommunications industry, which is the fastest-growing
industry in the world," said David Rogers, president of Rogers
Cantel Mobile Communications Ltd. He thinks there is strong
growth potential in developing countries which are expected to
feature strongly in the cellular boom.

Michael Patriarche, vice president of market development at
Northern Telecom Ltd, told Reuters that the cellular phone market
was growing by about 20% a year in developed countries and 80% a
year in emerging markets.

But many executives consider newer markets such as personal
wireless communicators as having even more exciting growth. Les
Shroyer, general manager of Motorola Inc wireless data systems
division, has predicted that 16% of the laptop computers sold in
North America will have wireless modems by 1998, compared with
2.5% today.

For multimedia to become a reality on the personal wireless
communicator, the communicators will have to be capable of
transmitting and receiving faxes, information services and email.
Shroyer said communicators are expected to have speech and
handwriting recognition by the end of this year.

He added that wireless multimedia, including moving images, will
begin in 1997 predicting that sound, text and motion will be
available at the turn of the century.

           PACIFIC BELL CONDEMNS FCC PRICE INCREASES
                      FOR CALIFORNIAN ISDN

Pacific Bell has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to withdraw plans to raise ISDN line charges in California,
which the regional Bell believes will push prices up by as much
as 50%.

ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) employs a single line
with multiple channels to provide high-speed digital transmission
of voice, data and video services. The technology provides much
faster access to information services and is claimed to be
essential for the successful take-up of video telephony.

Subscriber charges for ISDN are currently based on the number of
lines. The FCC wants to introduce a new charging structure that
will charge for the number of channels within the line. Basic
Rate ISDN can have up to three channels per line, while Primary
Rate ISDN lines can have up to 24 channels.

Under the new rate schedule for Basic Rate SDS, Home and Centrex
ISDN services, Pacific Bell customers will be charged for one,
two or three lines, depending on the configuration. Primary Rate
ISDN customers will be charged for either 23 or 24 lines.

Pacific Bell said the new charging structure will raise Basic
Rate Home and Centrex ISDN prices by up to 29%, SDS ISDN prices
by up to 43% and Primary Rate customers by up to 50%.

Pacific Bell issued a formal request to the FCC to waive Section
69.104 of the ruling, allowing the company to retain its current
method of charging by line rather than channel.

"ISDN has become a very cost-effective way to enter the
Information Superhighway," said John Gueldner, Pacific Bell's
vice president of regulatory affairs.

"But now, the mandated increase in ISDN line charges is a major
roadblock. Pacific Bell has made a concerted effort to keep its
prices for ISDN lines affordable."

He criticised the FCC for wanting to introduce a damaging mandate
"at the very time that ISDN is growing rapidly among small to
medium-sized businesses".

"These price increases will severely curtail this growth," he
said, adding that they could even reverse this enthusiasm to the
point of impeding future research into the technology.

Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis Group, provides
ISDN services to areas in California.

           AUSTRALIA PUTS GBP5BN INTO VOICE-TO-VIDEO

Australia Telecom is planning a GBP4,600m venture to upgrade its
cable network to include a new voice-to-video broadband network.

The planned infrastructure will improve the service of cable
television and introduce new features such as broadband telephony
and video conferencing.

Time scales were not available from the telecommunications
company but the plans would mean bringing forward the upgrade of
Australia's cable system, which is the basis of a pay-per-view
venture between Australia Telecom and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

Telecom's cable network is currently under construction and is
intended to connect 4m homes at a cost of GBP1.64m over the next
four years. Current plans run the cable alongside copper wire
telephony.

Australia Telecom's chief executive, Frank Blount, confirmed to
the Australian Financial Review that the national carrier is
reviewing the economics of maintaining and upgrading a phone
network based on a copper wire technology that is rapidly
becoming obsolete.

Although Blount would not be drawn on the costs of an integrated
network, the Federal Government appointed Broadband Services
Experts Group has said that a network of this kind would cost "in
excess of (GBP4,600m)".

Blount said that he intended to keep telephony separate from
Telecom's pay-per-view venture with Murdoch, but National
Australia Bank's magazine, Decisions, quotes Blount as saying,
"if we can make a case that we're going to integrate telephony
and broadband at the same time, we may be able to see our way to
justifying that kind of expenditure and wire up the whole
country".

Faced with the distances involved in the project, Blount
acknowledged that satisfying demand in a sparsely populated
country would be difficult but the company planned to use central
points in towns, such as libraries, as the broadband access
points from which homes could then be connected.

The move being explored by Telecom would complement strategies
mapped out for the development of a broadband services industry
to be unveiled by the Government through the release of the final
BSEG report, said the Australian Financial Review.

Australia Telecom's rival, Optus Vision, is using digital
technology to deliver pay-per-view and telephony on an
infrastructure that could be expanded to video telephony. Optus'
system drops optical fibre and coaxial cable to homes mostly hung
from overhead power cables.

Australia Telecom and News Corp are fine-tuning their pay-per-
view venture with a strong alliance with satellite licensee,
Australis Media Ltd. Telecom-News and Australis are considering a
cross-equity arrangement under which there will be an allotment
of shares and options. These will allow the groups to consider
possible strategic alliances in the future.

simultaneously down a telephone line will drive new applications
such as personal conferencing.

The RC288ACi/SVD, which will ship next month for $100, was
announced by the Digital Communications Division of Rockwell
International Corp, which also sees the modem chip being used for
multi-player computer games and technical support.

It enables PC users to exchange speech and data simultaneously
down a single telephone line, supports the V.34 standard for
28.8Kbps transmission, and conforms to the Digital Simultaneous
Voice and Data specification agreed between Rockwell, Intel Corp,
US Robotics Inc and Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.

It is combined with its own DigiTalk speech compression
technology that allows conversations at the same time as data
transmission at speeds up to 19.2Kbps. It also detects periods of
silence, when it boosts the data rate back up to 28.8Kbps
Rockwell International Corp's Rockwell Telecommunications has
opened a new wafer fab in Newport Beach, California and bills it
a key step towards its goal of becoming a $2,000m company by2000.
It aims to double its annual sales of data and facsimile modems
to about $1,000m by 1999, it said, adding wireless and multimedia
communications products to reach its 2000 target. The upgrade of
the plant to 8" wafers cost it $170m.

                HISTORY OF MULTIMEDIA - PART 2
            THE RULE OF CD-ROM AND VIDEOCONFERENCING

Multimedia technology main successes are in two areas: CD-ROM
and videoconferencing.

The most successful - and the first to be proven - is CD-ROM
(Compact Disc Read Only Memory) technology both as a means to
read large amounts of software and for companies to store large
amounts of data. Volume of information is the key. Each disk can
hold the equivalent of 300,000 pages of text - each disk holds
640Mb of information. The CD-ROM drive and a sound card provide
the baseline Multimedia PC (MPC) configuration.

                             CD-ROM

The number of drives shipped in 1993 soared by 170 per cent on
the previous year to 7.2 million worldwide. Research by Infotech
suggests that by 1999, 8 out of every 10 computers will have a
CD-ROM drive attached. The reason for the take-up is three fold:
they are cheap, they work and, with the increasing bulk of
Windows software, they fulfil a very useful function.

As with all emerging technologies, pricing is the key. CD-ROM
drives are available to computer dealers for under $100. They are
also being heavily pushed by software giants such as Microsoft,
which has used the increased user base of the drives deliver a
range of innovative software that takes advantage of CD ROM's
massive storage capability by allowing the user to run video
clips or search huge databases.

The Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM was set in 1986 by Philips
Electronics NV and Sony Corp. This set of guidelines for how data
was compressed and laid down onto the tracks of the disk.

Further standards allowed for compressed audio to be interwoven
with data - CD-ROM XA. The emerging Orange Book standard, which
is still under development, covers CD-R (recordable CD-ROM). At
present CD-ROM disks can only be record in one pass, unlike
magneto-optical (MO) disks and is a drawback of CD-ROM - that,
although it is very cheap for software houses to publish software
onto it - it is more expensive than conventional MO disks for
ordinary users to save data to.

The other CD-ROM standards relate to the drives themselves. The
original MPC (Multimedia PC) standard stated that the drive must
have a 'sustained data transfer rate' of at least 150Kb per
second, while using no more than 40 per cent of the CPU.

This standard was soon superseded, as a data transfer of 150Kbps
proved too slow to accurately produce seamless video on screen. A
second generation of 'dual speed' CD-ROM drives, which read the
disks at speeds of 300Kbps and above, have been developed by
manufacturers including NEC Corp, Pioneer Corp and Toshiba Corp.
The new MPC2 standard reflects the requirement for digital video
stored on disk.

                       VIDEO CONFERENCING

The second successful usage of multimedia technology is full
motion video images run on a PC. This technology - primarily
driven by advances in compression algorithms - means that faster
and better quality video can be played on the PC.

The obvious and concrete benefits for business are apparent:
Computer Based Training (CBT), presentations, point of sale
displays and - potentially the one with the widest impact - video
conferencing.

Video Conferencing is an area of concerted development for large
companies such as Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, mainly because
the technology developed for businesses will also crossover to
the perceived lucrative area of domestic video-on-demand
services.

Both Intel and high end workstation provider Silicon Graphics Inc
have developed video conferencing systems for the PC - although
both have been held back by the limitations of the personal
computer which when it was originally designed, or as it evolved,
was not expected to survive in so many manifestations.

As a consequence, video data can be sent at speed along ISDN
lines (although even these are slow offering 64 or 128Kbps
compared with fibre optic cables which can run parallel channels
each containing many megabits per second) but is brought
shuddering to a halt when it gets to the PC.

"The biggest bottleneck on sending and receiving video is the
system bus" said Silicon Graphics Steve Webb."

"Development there has not kept pace with processor development."
Launched in mid-1993, the Silicon Graphics Indy Workstation was
the first PC system built for dedicated peer-to-peer video
conferencing. It came with a 30 frames per second video camera
bolted to the top of the monitor and an ISDN port.

On the Intel platform, the struggle has been to improve the
compression of the mass of video data coming into the PC. Intel
itself released its Smart Video Recorder and Indeo compression
card in April 1993, but admitted that peer-to-peer video
conferencing required compression beyond what was available at
the time.

Intel limited its efforts to allowing PC users to view video
clips and this is where video on the desktop has stalled for a
while.

Many of the technical problems with the PC's capacity to handle
video have since been improved but there is one major obstacle to
overcome.

The lack of a nation-wide fibre optic cabling structure means
that video conferencing will - initially, at least  - be limited
to within a specific site, rather than over wider sites where it
is really most useful.

                          POINT OF SALE

Point of Sales Kiosks are a spin-off from PC video conferencing,
but a spin-off with, real spin. Point of Sales (POS) kiosks are
designed to run full motion video product demonstrations for
customers. The more sophisticated can also provide a 'real time'
video link to remote sales staff.

The Thomas Cook multimedia travel kiosk - at the firm's flagship
Marble Arch branch - is a good example of POS multimedia in
action.

Using a system developed and installed by Olivetti, prospective
tourists are wafted to their dream destinations without even
having to leave the travel agents. The system, which ended its
trials in prototype in mid-1994, uses 17" touchscreen to allow
customers to access video and audio presentations of popular
holiday destinations.

The POS system is more than just a fancy travel brochure. It has
an integrated video link so the customer could call up a
salesperson in the top corner of the screen. The system even
accepts electronic payment by credit card.

"Pushy sales staff scare off more customers than technology,"
says the Inteco Inc research firm, adding that certain types of
retail operations - where the products being sold are technical
or sophisticated - are better suited to selling by kiosk than
others.

The Thomas Cook system was based around a 486 PC with video
camera and board, ISDN connector, CD-ROM drive and, most
importantly, a touchscreen. Previous research has shown that the
keyboard is the major cause of fear and loathing amongst the non-
computer-literate.

The real interest with multimedia kiosks though, is as a
precursor for the world of home shopping.

This is where much of the development is, with the idea that the
user can summon up product information and make purchases from
their own home. The first moves in the UK have been through Intel
and Microsoft signing up with US cable companies to provide a
limited form of 'video-on-demand.' Multimedia kiosks are seen as
a link to the lucrative world of home interactive shopping.

                               CBT

Computer Based Training (CBT) and Presentations were the first
real uses of multimedia, and are still the biggest employers of
interactive technology.

CBT is primarily a way for the largest companies to standardise
the training that they give employees - by making sure that
everyone gets exactly the same message at the same time.
Multimedia sales presentations have traditionally been the
preserve of the largest corporates, which usually focus more on
an identical message tailored by bespoke software providers, than
on any egalitarian cutting edge technology.

The growth in CBT and presentations has come as they have been
opened up to smaller companies and developers, fuelled by the
launch of multimedia authoring tools.

The market leader for Windows authoring packages is Multimedia
Toolbook 3.0 from Asymetrix, which allows full-motion video
editing and the incorporation of video on the desktop. The
programme can then be imported into a more conventional
presentation package. As the use of multimedia extends to the
less bold, authoring tools will be used by wider  audiences
developing a broader range of interactive applications.

            3DO DENIES IT NEEDS EXTERNAL FINANCING

3DO has denied reports that it is looking for increased financing
despite stockbrokers recommendations that the company look
outside for cash before the end of the year.

Reports from Reuters in January had suggested the Interactive
Multiplayer device maker's chairman, Trip Hawkins, was making
calls for external financing for the 3DO graphics accelerator,
the M-2.

But a spokesperson for the company countered the report, saying
that the company would call on its existing associates, including
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd and Goldstar Co Ltd, before
casting a net out for new investors.

"If we do need financing we would prefer to go to our partners
first", the company said, adding that Hawkins had only suggested
that the M-2, codenamed 'Bulldog', as "an attractive strategic
business partnership for outside businesses".

But David Tabizel, a multimedia analyst at Durlacher stockbrokers
in London, thinks the company will need more money in the next
six to nine months and should not accept it from its existing
partners.

"They're grown up now and should see if they can fight it out on
their own," he said. "They ought to be looking at the US
investment community based on the M-2."

Tabizel also voiced concern about Matsushita's involvement with
other manufacturers such as Panasonic Co and Japanese Victor Co.
"They're hedging their bets," he said.

Trip Hawkins said that the M-2 accelerator was scheduled to be
shipping later this year. He also claimed that the accelerator,
and other manufacturing cost savings that he would not specify,
could take $100 off the $400 3DO price tag.

The timing of M-2's release is vital against other platforms due
for release, he said.

"M-2 is going to transform 3DO into one of the most feasible
platforms," he said, although he added that it depends on the
successful release of other 64-bit machines such as Sony's
Playstation and Nintendo's Ultra."Atari's Jaguar, he said, is
"nearly dead in the water".

3DO shares took a hit in May last year, falling 20% when Hawkins
was reported to be putting $10m of his own money into the company
to support it over 1995.

However, the company said Hawkins had always put his own money
into the company. "It's never been a problem for us to raise
capital," the company said.

        KODAK SNAPS MOVING PICS WITH HIGHEST RESOLUTION

Eastman Kodak Co claims to have produced the world's highest
resolution SLR 36-bit digital camera that can be taken into the
field, the DCS 460, available immediately for GBP25,000.

The DCS 460 is a single shot camera that can take a colour image
with a single exposure rather than the multiple exposure needed
for most digital cameras limiting them to still life photographs.

The news follows an announcement in January that Canon, Nikon,
Hasselblad, Mamiya and Sinar are to use Kodak's digital imaging
technology from the DCS 400 series for their digital cameras.

The CCD imager that sits behind a standard 35mm camera enables a
total resolution of 6m pixels compared with other cameras that
offer 4m pixels. The imager sits in a special electronic back
fixed to the body of a Nikon N90 camera.

The DCS 460 is a 'multi-megapixel' camera that does not require
multiple exposures to render a single colour image, a
characteristic that limits other cameras to still life
photographed in a studio. Kodak claims the single exposure camera
increase portability to the field or the studio.

Time taken between power-on and the first shot is 0.25 seconds
with about 12 seconds between shots while the camera saves the
image to disk. The DCS 460 can store images on removable PCMCIA-
ATA cards and includes a battery pack that is claimed to provide
power for over 300 images in a single charge.

Sound annotation can be included in the image for tagging or
identifying the image with a built-in microphone.

The imager for the DCS 460 is available separately as the DCS 465
Digital Camera Back. The digital imager fits to the body of 4" by
5" SLR devices. Pricing was not available.In February, Sony Corp
challenged Kodak's Photo CD by joining Japanese camera company,
Konica Corp, to develop a digital imaging system that records
film on Sony's 2.5" Mini Discs.

Sony's system enables users to record images from photographic
negative films, slides, prints and printed materials directly
onto the optical disks, and edit the recorded images and
manipulate them into various formats. The system comprises an
image recorder, an image processor and a scanner. Up to 200
images can be written on one disk, and it takes seven seconds to
record one negative. Prices and marketing for Sony's system have
not yet been set.

       ASYMETRIX SELLS ENTERTAINMENTS FOR WINDOWS TOOLS

Eighty nine people are to go at Asymetrix Corp, Bellevue,
Washington which is selling its entertainment division in order
to focus on Windows tools for multimedia development and client-
server offerings.

It said that it is in talks with potential buyers but no sale has
been made.

The company's acting president Vern Raburn said that although the
company had doubled its revenue over the last year it had become
clear that if it were to achieve its long-term business and
financial goals, it had to focus its resources in those areas
that would provide the most opportunity for growth.

It sees these as visual and multimedia authoring software with
appropriate add-on tools; graphics tool for creating three
dimensional images and animation; and a video editing tool.
The core product in the client-server tools business is Asymetrix
InfoModeler version 1.5, a visual modelling tool for database
design.

The entertainment division's products include screen savers based
on Jurassic Park, the Pink Panther, Rocky and Bullwinkle among
others.

Asymetrix says it is also attempting to sell Compel, the
company's multimedia presentation graphics product.

                     THE GREAT EXHIBITION

The US, UK, Japan, France, Germany, Canada and Italy - the Group
of Seven - met in the weekend of February 25/26 to discuss the
impact of the information superhighway on jobs, culture and
economics.



"The distances which separated the different nations and parts of
the globe are rapidly vanishing before the achievements of modern
invention, and we can traverse them with incredible ease ...
thought is communicated with the rapidity, and even by the power,
of lightning."

So said England's Prince Albert in a speech given to Royal
Commissioners of the Exhibition in preparation for the Great
Exhibition of May 1, 1851. The Exhibition was the world's chance
to show off the latest and greatest technology and gave the
analysts of the age an opportunity to discuss what could be done
to make it better.

Almost 150 years later, G-7 ministers in Belgium over the weekend
of February 25/26 were surrounded by a trade fair of scientific
sorcery from more than 100 of the world's leading technology
firms.

The amazement was apparent as delegates watched demonstrations
including machines to check hand prints instead of passports,
two-way educational link ups for schoolchildren in isolated areas
and virtual reality guided tours of world museums.

Winding up the conclusion of the Conference, the Chair said, "Les
temps est venu." The time has come... again.

But the G-7 conference differs from its Victorian equivalent is
that the participants do not believe we are creating a perfect
world.

Jaques Delors, chairman of the Information Society Round Table
said, "I am not saying that a globalised world will be better
than a non-globalised one. Maybe we lived better in the 15th
Century... one must face reality."

This reality has added two uncomfortable lessons to the
unswerving passion that enthused the Victorians to consider
theirs the"period of most wonderful transition" that held the
world for a little under a century.

The fact that some countries have lagged the technological leaps
of the US, Europe and Japan has not been lost on the G-7's
ministers. To avoid a two-tier system, ministers are talking of
bringing developing countries up to speed by allowing them to
"leap-frog" the technological evolution over which they have
presided. Open access to networks and the equality of opportunity
are central principles of the G-7 framework.

But jumping evolutionary stages and avoiding the instability that
can occur in economies swamped by technological revolution is no
easy process.

In cases such as Singapore, which is small enough to share the
benefits equally among its population, little administration is
needed.

In others, with urban and rural areas so far apart that whole
cultures differ within the country, the two can work in conflict.

As one economist pointed out, the conference would not attempt to
solve the world's problems, but the adverse affects of hasty
evolution is evident in the trade wars between US and China.

China, like Japan, has been leap-frogging technology for years
and the US, having most to gain from deregulated competition due
to a massive and highly sophisticated telecommunications
infrastructure, is aware of the threat to fair competition that
is inherent in an unbalanced global system.

China suffers - or will suffer - from a culture that has not
grown up with copyright law and expects the black market to act
as a valid sector of the economy. That same culture will find it
difficult to marry urban and rural areas when faced with the
scale of telecommunications multimedia.

Technology can be treated as an exogenous variable in economics,
driving or being driven by a country's internal money system.
Small countries such as Singapore can benefit easily if the gains
due to technology can be distributed quickly and fairly around a
small population.

But a country the size of China, or the former Soviet Union,
requires a stronger hold on the infrastructure and education
Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's vice president, sees investment in
domestic labour as the greatest benefit G-7's ministers can offer
his country.

He sees his society becoming a mere consumer of information
unless foreign companies move manufacture to the newly
democratised country. "Come and make your computers in Ghana," he
said. "Come and make them in South Africa."

If the US gets its way and Al Gore, chieftain of its information
revolution, opens its telecommunications market to foreign
investment "up to 100%", there seems a much reduced role for the
authorities.

Computer standards - like governmental regulation, customarily
subject to the chore of an administration - have been in the
hands of the industry for years. But there is a central
distinction between the computer industry, with its competitive,
consumer-driven motivation, and the telecommunications industry
which has been the ward of government since it replaced the
railways.

It is a familiar saying by now that free trade tends to be
advocated by those people who have most to be gained from it.

Two weeks after the Great Exhibition of the 19th Century, the
editor of Illustrated London News pointed to the hoards of
working men and women who swarmed around the exhibits, "the men
who made the Exhibition what it is, and who, we fervently hope,
will derive the greatest advantage from it."

                      OUTSOURCING THE NET

CERN has passed responsibility for the Internet to MIT and the
French research institute, INRIA. Marsha W Johnston talks to the
Internet's adopted parents.



In the coming months, network security and commercialisation
issues, such as how to create paying services, will be the
highest priority subjects for Internet development, says Olivier
Muron, director of promotions and technology transfer for
France's National Institute of Research in Informatics
and Automation (INRIA).

Up until a few weeks ago, INRIA was just another Internet service
location and Muron's sentiment would have been just another Web
user's speculation. But following an agreement with the European
Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, INRIA, along with
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is now
responsible for supporting and managing the evolution of World
Wide Web (W3) technology.

CERN has been the centre of W3 technology since Tim Berners-Lee,
a CERN researcher, invented it in 1989. That the invention came
from the elite international community of high-energy physics was
not surprising, since it "is a very geographically distributed
and computer-literate community that has been using computer
networks to distribute documents and for email for a long time,"
says Mike Sendall, secretary for CERN's Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) experiments committee.

W3 was a welcome development because it alleviated the
physicists' headache of using multiple, incompatible networks
around the world to exchange the voluminous test data that is
critical to better understanding the behaviour of the universe.

Having invented W3 technology, CERN naturally developed as the
centre of the standardisation effort for 'The Net' (aka
Internet). "In the early days of The Net, it was entirely
appropriate for us to be the focus of activity," Sendall says.

Today, however, there is an entirely different story. No longer
is the Internet the privileged domain of a largely academic
computer user audience. The Internet Society reported that new
Net subscribers grew 22% in the fourth quarter of 1994, while the
(.)net domain, used largely by commercial service providers, grew
at an astonishing 66%. At this rate, the society predicts the Net
will count 100 million hosts by 1998.

"The centre of gravity has shifted, if you like; the Net is now
of much broader interest than just to our community," Sendall
said, by way of explaining why CERN chose to disengage itself
from W3  development and promotion.

"It was a question of the amount of work there is to do and to
what extent it maps onto CERN's mission," said Sendall. He added
that the approval in December of the Collider project made it
increasingly difficult for CERN to continue its historic W3 role.

At the time, Sendall was already in discussions with MIT and the
European Commission on establishing joint European/US support for
the W3 standards. "Both the EC and CERN wanted a strong European
presence with the standard and INRIA seemed like a good bunch of
people to take it over," he said.

Indeed, INRIA has been the starting point for some of France's
hottest young information technology companies, including Object
Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS) developer O2
Technology, C++ tools editor ILOG and SGML expert Grif. Aside
from running its own professional Web service.

INRIA developed a Web service '100 Years of Light in the
Paintings of French Museums' for the Ministry of Culture and was
retained by the EC as a 'national host' for advanced Web services
in its Advanced Communications Technologies & Services.

"INRIA has done quite a lot of Web development. They have not
played a big role in central standardisation issues, but they are
quite experienced in networking and security issues," Sendall
said, adding that those are the two most important areas for The
Net at this stage.

No decisions have yet been made on how to split development
duties, he said. Service support will be "divided up more or less
geographically to minimise our telecom charges, but it will be
transparent to the user," he said.

Broadly stated, however, INRIA and MIT's work will comprise four
main areas:
- evolution of Web components, including the markup language,
html, the client/server dial-up protocol, http, and url, the
universal residence locator;
- development of a reference code;
- supply of general information about the Web; and
- promotion of the technology and its distribution.

Sendall said CERN will continue Web developments that are
targeted specifically at its own user community, rather than
generally focused issues.

Muron places great importance on the informational aspect of
INRIA's charter. "We have to provide enough detailed information
about the Web so that someone who doesn't know anything about it
could learn on their own how to use W3 technology," he said.

In the meantime, INRIA is planning an increase in its own Web
service. "To pass the level of directory service consultation as
CERN's, which is automatically accessed by thousands of users
every day, we need bigger workstations and increased network
capacity," he said.

Sendall is not worried that CERN's departure will cause standards
to evolve away from the users. "We use lots of other standards
that we don't define."

                   REAL ACTORS TAKE A BREAK

Virtual actors are to be used in a commercial for Rowntree
Macintosh to be screened in May.

Rowntree, a subsidiary of Swiss food giant, Nestle SA, has
contracted Snapper Productions, a London-based production
company, to make the commercial using a virtual simulation
technique known as Motion Analysis.

Details of the production are a closely guarded secret but Robert
Goldbold, the producer of the commercial, said the techniques
used were "like nothing before".

Motion Analysis begins with a digital coding technique called
Cyberscanning which captures colour and texture data such as that
on a person's face. The data is then "wrapped around a geometric
wire-frame" and animated.

Cinesight Ltd, a digital production house working on Lawnmower
Man 2 in London and Los Angeles, said it was not aware of any
other commercial using this technique.

The lack of virtual reality technology in commercials was
emphasised by Pat Joseph, production director for The Mill, which
recently made an advert for the Nationwide building society , the
second biggest in the UK. The Mill's advert merged an image of
Alfred Hitchcock with a lookalike reading the script.

"There's very little VR in television commercials at the moment,"
he said, stressing that although using technology to sell was
impressive, "the most effective commercials are still the comic
ones".

Walt Disney Co has registered a patent that manipulates video
textures such as the face of a recording of a live actor.

            VIRTUAL SCHOOLING TRAVELS TO 14 STATES

The US West Foundation will be taking virtual reality across 14
states to schools which are unable to motivate children to
learning.

The Foundation is the philanthropic arm of telecommunications
company, US West Inc, which spent $1.2m of its annual $25m budget
on the project.

Two Virtual Reality Roving Vehicles (VRRVs) were proposed by the
Foundation in collaboration with the University of Washington's
Human Interface Technology Laboratory (HIT Lab) and UK virtual
reality systems firm, Division Ltd. The vehicles are actually
just vans carrying the virtual development equipment to schools
across US West's 14 state territory.

Virtual reality environments are ideal for stimulating children
who are not attending classes to take a more active role in the
lessons, according to Jane Prancan, executive director of the
Foundation.

Children and teachers are taught to use a menu-driven version of
Division's authoring software, dVise, to build virtual
environments in which they can move around rainforests or see the
movements of molecules."

It does require kids who put the virtual environment together to
do a lot of their own research," she said.

Clive Jones, a marketing manager for Division, said the menu-
driven system was far easier to use than language-based
programming environments.

Bringing up a menu, the children can choose shapes and colours,
positions and constraints, then scale or colour the virtual
world, he said. The developing environment enabled children to
create worlds with icons on screen or author on the fly in free-
space.

"The object of the programme is to bring in interest from
students who are switched off from schooling," he said, "using it
as a stimulus to bring them back into the learning process."

The Foundation first took the VRRVs to Garfield High School, a
school in a low-income, high-minority area of Seattle,
Washington. The vehicles will cover the rest of Washington before
moving on to Nebraska. The VRRV is also intended to be taken into
rural areas where technology is not given the funding afforded
metropolitan schools.

Division donated one third of the cost of the two GBP65,000
ProVision 100 systems and head mounted displays and the company
is keen to increase its presence in educational products like the
VRRV. It is currently involved in the 'Train to Travel' project
in Miami which uses virtual reality to teach mentally
disadvantaged children to use the local bus service.

The Foundation, which has donated more than $50m over the past
two years, also funded a $550,000 project in Denver, Colorado, to
create the on-line Families and Children Network launched in
February in partnership with advice agencies, in particular the
national non-profit network, HandsNet, and the Centre for Human
Investment Policy (CHIP) at the University of Colorado, Denver.

The Network links families to consultants in professional advice
agencies.

           RENDERMORPHICS 3D APIs DUE FOR WINDOWS96

Microsoft has acquired RenderMorphics to include 3D application
interfaces in versions of Windows after Windows95.

London-based RenderMorphics Ltd has been converting its Reality
Lab 3D rendering library to run on a variety of operating systems
including Windows NT 3.5 for iAPX-86, WinG, Alpha, PowerPC and
the next release of the Sony Playstation.

All employees will be brought into the Microsoft fold. Reality
Lab development will remain in the UK but the marketing personnel
will be relocated to the US. Terms of the deal were not disclosed
but Microsoft shares rose 50c to $62 following the news.

Anne Mitchard, senior Windows product manager in the UK, has been
given responsibility for Microsoft's development of the Reality
Lab 3D library. She said the technology would be used to develop
3D application programming interfaces (APIs) to be included in
future versions of Windows although it will not be available in
Windows 95.

She confirmed that the technology would increasingly become a
feature of future operating systems although she would not say
whether this meant an immersive environment for Windows.

"You're going to see a lot more 3D influence in operating system
environments," she said.

Nor would Mitchard comment on what the successor to Windows95
would be called although Brad Silverberg, vice president of
Microsoft's personal systems division, told PC Week in February
that the incremental upgrade would be called Windows96.

RenderMorphics sales would not be affected by the acquisition and
products, she said. Reality Lab 3D version 1.1, due by the end of
April, would still be available to outside developers. Version
2.0 is currently in beta.

Microsoft has been demonstrating a number of products at the
Multimedia Reviewers' Workshop in February, including the
Enhanced CD standard due to replace Multisession CD, and
Mediamatics Inc's software MPEG player that is planned for
Windows 95.

A small advertisement in the local newspaper has had a group of
campaigners for better behaviour all over the place, Dutch and
Gloria Pruyne, picketing Fry's Electronics in Fountain Valley,
California, part of a seven store chain for two consecutive
weekends.

The ad read "Meet Dominique St Croix, Penthouse magazines'
Hottest pet! She'll Autograph Your Copy of the New Penthouse
Photo Shoot CD-ROM Volumes I, II and II, Saturday 2pm, Fry's
Electronics, Fountain Valley, California".

The Pruyne fliers read "Studies show that urban areas with
sexually-oriented businesses have higher crime rates than similar
areas without such businesses".

I spoke to Mrs Pruyne who advised me that she would not want her
daughter going out with a boy who had just pored over nude
bodies.

She doesn't actually have a daughter but two sons, one David, 27,
who lives at home with his parents and does have a CD player for
his PC. He claims never to have seen an 'adult' CD-ROM but says
he "gets the basic concept".

Gloria Pruyne complained that men had been coming out of the
store "waving the CDs in our faces".

"When men are into pornography, they desensitise themselves to
normal sexual stimulation," she said lowering, her voice to warn
me, "then they lead their wives into kinky sex".

A spokesperson for Fry's - usually impossibly difficult to
extract a comment from, in Palo Alto who would only identify
herself as "Janet" pointed out Dominique St Croix would have her
clothes on at the store when she arrived. When we checked at the
store, we found that Penthouse CD-ROMs have sold out with another
order placed and on the way.

                  CROSS DRESSING NEVER EASIER

The virtual mirror, which enables people to try clothes on using
the computer, has been developed by Spanish firms, Arcast SA and
Cyan Animatica SA.

Arcast's Luis Claudio Arfuch described the system as a "kind of
automatic cash-dispenser, with a built-in camera that captures a
high-definition image of the potential customer".

A height and weight sensor helps to adjust the parameters of a
standard model to each person. The biggest technical challenge is
creating certain effects, such as tucking a shirt into trousers.
Once items have been chosen, the machine prints out a ticket
showing  size and price.

The machine will operate interactively 24 hours a day, so it can
be consulted even when the shop is closed.

                   AMERICA ONLINE PRESSURES
              MICROSOFT NETWORK WITH 2M SUBSCRIBERS

America Online has added over 500,000 subscribers giving it a
total of 2m users of a service which analysts reckon is cheap and
intuitive enough to threaten the Microsoft Network due later this
year.

Figures from America Online, the largest on-line service in the
US, show that it has more than trebled its subscriber base in
just over a year. The on-line service provider had 600,000
subscribers in January 1994.

Lorraine Sileo, an on-line analyst for Simba Information Inc,
admitted she found it hard to believe America Online's success
was sustainable but the company's low and predictable connection
costs would put it at the head of its competitors for some time.

Although America Online claims to have spread "through word of
mouth", she said it had gained a considerable number of
subscriptions from the access software being included in bundles
with PCs. America Online spokesperson, Pam McGraw, refused to
comment on how many subscriptions arose from PC bundles.

Sileo said affordable charges with no surprise bills was the most
important factor to families. "You know what your bills are going
to be," she said.

While this applies to present competition such as Compuserve Inc
and Prodigy Services Co, Sileo also drew attention to the
Microsoft Network as a potential victim to home consumers'
prerequisites, citing too few free areas and the possibility of
an unreliable launch.

"Microsoft probably won't launch until the end of the year
considering its anti-trust problems," she said, "and when it does
I don't think it will have the content. There will probably be
more premium services (than America Online). Right now America
Online doesn't have to worry about the Microsoft Network."

Refusing to comment on America Online's competition, McGraw said
the success was due to the mix of features and affordable price
of the on-line service.

          LONG-DISTANCE PROVIDERS GET "WAKE-UP CALL"
                    FROM NETPHONE ON INTERNET

The pending Internet telephone service is a "wake-up call" to
purveyors of long-distance telecommunications, said Andrew Green,
founder and president of Electric Magic Company in San Francisco.

The three-year-old company is currently sampling a demo version
of its voice Internet software product, NetPhone, over the World
Wide Web.

Because of the proprietary nature of the few Internet Phone
methodologies now hitting the market, long distance carriers are
not under a threat - for the moment, Green said.

"I see Internet telephone service as an inspiration and a wake-up
call to the telephone industry," he said. "This is something that
can't come from the top down. It has to come up from the bottom
roots of the industry.

"I don't see Internet telephones replacing normal phones, but
acting as an adjunct to them."

Right now, interoperability and the fact that relatively few
people are hard-wired into the Internet, are the biggest factors
holding back the technology.

But all it takes is time, he said, adding, "give it a couple
years. It's just a matter of cranking out the software".

Internet telephones will provide much more flexibility because of
the lack of regulatory controls and standards existing on today's
long-distance carriers.

"You can't even do something as simple as split the cost of a
phone call," Green pointed out.

Internet phones are a good use of the bandwidth using only about
one-sixth of the carrier. Internet packet-switched signals travel
at about 10,000bps as opposed to the 64,000bps required for
normal connection-switched voice calls.

NetPhone software, which Green developed with his partner, Denise
Meyers, runs only on Macintosh LC II computers or better with
800Kb of memory available.

System requirements also include a microphone and a serial-line
Internet protocol (SLID) or a point-to-point protocol (PTP)
Internet connection.

NetPhone uses Electric Magic Company's own audio compression
algorithm which compresses the voice bandwidth to 10,000bps over
the Internet.

The software is available for demo review over Info-Mac and its
UK mirror site. NetPhone is available for purchase at $55 for one
copy and $85 for two.

VocalTec Inc, based in Tel Aviv, IsrAel, and NorthVale, New
Jersey, announced the Internet Phone last month. the software
allows a TCP/IPconnection to carry an international telephone
call via the Internet at the cost of a connection to a local
Internet provider at local prices.

VocalTec is offering the software at $50 with plans to double the
price when the company's trial period finishes in April. An
evaluation copy is available from VocalTec's Internet Web site
which had 25,000 accesses in the first three days of opening.

A software robot called Lycos, designed to help people to find
information on the World Wide Web now has a search facility that
will carry out text searches of all Web documents on the net as
opposed to other engines which search  merely the titles. Lycos's
creator,  Michael Maudlin, at Carnegie-Mellon University believes
this facility makes the software technically superior to other
query searchers  and he is looking for ways to finance he systems
expansion through subscription, advertising or making a charge
per individual transaction. Lycos (Gk: wolf) catalogues Web
documents then identifies the links between the documents.
Maudlin said that Lycos has downloaded about half the World Wide
Web so far - about 280,000 Web pages catalogued into 1.6m
documents with numbers growing by 10,000 a week.

Virgin Group hopes "to do a Swatch" on its multimedia PC this
Summer by making the "uglier bits more visible". Peter Welsh,
managing director of Virgin Group Plc's PC division, Virgin
Euromagnetics, said the new moulding design will do to the PC
what Swatch did to the watch. Transparent panels will overlay red
and black mouldings to make the internals of the PC visible and a
big, red knob on the front. Virgin began production of PCs in
1993 with targeted sales of 25,000 a year but failed to secure
sufficiently firm retail channels for the PCs. The company hopes
its OEM agreement with ICL last September will put it on sturdier
ground.

and  to encourage the use of ASDM. ASDM Forum said  that research
by British Telecommunications Plc showed that ASDM is suitable
for a variety of services in that, for example, the technology is
operable at greater distancces - upt to three and three quarter
miles at 2Mbps, and that Moving Pictures Expert Group coding

Full and immediate competition in the communications industry
would create 48,100 new jobs in Massachusetts by the year 2000,

firm, The WEFA Group. The study concludes that immediate
competition would result in the creation of 3.4 million new jobs
in all states and all major industry groups by the year 2005.
Legislation currently being debated in the US would repeal
federal restrictions prohibiting competition in local and long
distance telephone, cable television and manufacturing. The WEFA
Group Study found that full and immediate competition would lower
telecommunications and cable rents by nearly $55 billion per
year. In fact, cost savings associated with competition would add
