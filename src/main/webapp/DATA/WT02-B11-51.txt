English translation of the summary in the Danish White Paper (October 1995)
<hr><a name="top"></a><p>

<b>Summary of the Reflections and Proposals of the Committee<br></b>
In spite of an increasing Danish and international attention to the entrepreneurship issue, there are no systematic studies proving that certain pedagogic methods, teaching methods etc. further the development of certain personal qualifications. As the basis for its proposals, the committee has therefore supported its arguments by reference to on the one hand the experience gained by the educational institutions themselves and on the other hand to the experience gained in other countries.
<p>
The committee therefore suggests that a study should be undertaken in 4 or 5 years' time about the experience gained with those proposals in this report which are adopted.
<p>
The proportion of people employed within those occupations (agriculture and the liberal professions), which in the past led to the inclusion in a certain social and cultural environment, is decreasing. The social and family environments, in which a person grows up and by means of which the independence culture is continuously renewed, are therefore not either as widespread as they used to be. The long and the short of it is that young people today typically do not have parents who run their own businesses, and there are not very many among the parents' acquaintances either who have owned or own their own businesses. This - combined with the fact that the education system of today is generally directed at the creation of wage earners, and that teachers at Danish educational institutions do not necessarily feel entitled or obliged to indicate career or education and training alternatives - has resulted in a widespread wage earner culture. It is therefore a substantial task to make proposals for a global educational strategy in the entrepreneurial area.
<p>
With a view to being in a position to make proposals for a global educational strategy with progression where new elements are all the time being built in top of each other, and where several considerations are furthered simultaneously, the committee has found it appropriate to distinguish between three cultural spheres:
<p>
- The entrepreneurial culture which covers the occupational and educational background.<br>
- The innovation culture which comprises certain forms of co-operation, methods for problem-solving, the compilation of information, methods for self-learning, project management etc.<br>
- The independence culture, which refers to a number of broader personal qualities such as initiative, readiness when it comes to taking risks, decision-making, flexibility etc.<p>

The independence culture can be sought furthered and developed through initiatives, which are characterized by attitude and motivation, and in which the pedagogy is the central element. This may be done at all levels of the education system, and it is of decisive importance that it commences in the Folkeskole (primary and lower secondary school) in particular, as this is in a manner of speaking the place, where the groundwork is laid. Also the general parts of youth education, including the individually organised youth education, shall be inspired by this way of thinking. It is a recurrent feature in many foreign educational initiatives in the entrepreneurial area that the preparation of attitudes and the fact that the attention is being drawn to it are the altogether central elements.<p>

The innovation culture can be sought furthered through the development of good working practices, working methods etc. commencing as early as in vocationally oriented youth education and general upper secondary education and continuing in higher education. Also in this context is the pedagogy playing a rather central role, where it is among other things important to work with pupils and students as if they were collaborators in their own learning processes. The interaction in relation to the independence culture consists in the continuous development of personal qualities such as co-operation and communication skills,  which are essential in project work and project management, parallel to the development of good working practices etc.
<p>
The entrepreneurial culture can be sought furthered and developed through a combination of the more attitude-oriented initiatives inherent in the independence- and innovation culture and the more occupationally oriented initiatives. The occupationally oriented initiatives may comprise knowledge of economics, accounting, marketing, market analysis etc. which are some of the specific occupational qualifications which entrepreneurs typically express a need to know more about. It is decisive here that these elements are introduced with a practical approach and when possible also with an as great extent of occupational orientation as possible. It may therefore be natural to look at this type of initiative as a project, as project-related tasks or as concluding elements of a course of education or as elements in an adult education or continuing training programme.
<p>
In this way, it is possible to create both coherence and progression so that the specific occupational qualifications are built on top of some already developed qualities and skills and some general organisational and managerial qualifications. In this way, the participants will be able to derive the greatest possible benefit from a target-oriented occupational learning which can only become target-oriented at this particular time.
<p>
The report shows that some very interesting and promising initiatives are already in the process of being implemented at regional and local level as well as at the individual educational institutions. These initiatives typically draw on the knowledge and expertise which already exist at regional and local level. This knowledge and expertise is presumed to be used continuously and to be extended in co-operation with the educational institutions.<p>
With the point of departure in this overall concept, the proposals of the committee for a global educational strategy can be summed up and divided into the following 10 themes:
<p>
<a href="#a">a. Pedagogy</a><br>
<a href="#b">b. Teaching materials and guidance</a><br>
<a href="#c">c. In-service training of teachers</a><br>
<a href="#d">d. Proposals within the existing framework</a><br>
<a href="#e">e. Proposals for new courses of education</a><br>
<a href="#f">f. Co-operation across institutional boundaries</a><br>
<a href="#g">g. Co-operation between educational institutions and business and industry</a><br>
<a href="#h">h. Right to continuing training as an entrepreneur</a><br>
<a href="#i">i. Network formations</a><br>
<a href="#j">j. Innovation and development funds.</a><p>

<b><a name="a">a. Pedagogy</a><br></b>
The acquisition of qualifications presumes that the individual pupil or student has a will and ability to develop. The acquisition and development of personal qualifications alone and in combination with occupational qualifications require that the pupil or student involves him- or herself in the learning process and processes the experience gained. The learner's active participation in the teaching process is at the centre irrespective of the level of education.
Some principles of the learning may take their point of departure in the following five general pedagogical principles:
<p>
1.	Determined by the participants who are responsible for their own learning, i.e. the learning process must as far as possible be initiated and determined by the learner him- or herself.
<p>
2.	Problem-oriented, i.e. the participants work with real and realistic problems which motivate curiosity.
<p>
3.	Experience-based, i.e. the learner's own experience must as far as possible be included in the teaching and be elaborated on in the learning process.
<p>
4	Differentiated teaching and personal style of learning, i.e. the learner is given the possibility to use his own way of learning in co-operation with others.
<p>
5.	Project-oriented and interdisciplinary, i.e. the learner must be confronted with self-defined 	tasks, which cut across subjects and subject-areas.
<p>
These general pedagogical principles place the learner - the pupil/student - at the centre of his or her own learning processes. These principles mean that the role of the teacher is changed so that he or she will now to a much greater extent get to function as a consultant and sparring partner to the learner. One must however also be aware of the fact that, although these principles are introduced from the very start of the schooling in the Folkeskole, they will be getting an increasing emphasis, as the learner assumes more and more responsibility for his or her own learning - also as an adult. This includes the working method and form of organisation in the very process by which the vocational qualifications are acquired. The ability to learn by oneself constitutes one of the very basic elements of the innovation culture, as this implies that the pupil/student must develop the ability to evaluate and make quality assessments. This also makes it possible for the pupil/student to become better at helping him/herself in the long term, irrespective of whether this implies a life as self-employed or not.<p>
<b>
<a name="b">b. Teaching materials and guidance</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:<br>
- that the guidance material from the National Council for Vocational and Educational Guidance (R.U.E.) is changed, and that it will among other things mention the subjects which may be of relevance to those who are contemplating the idea of becoming self-employed,<br>

- that the local educational institutions draw up curricula which include the entrepreneurial theme in the local timetable,
<br>
- that teaching materials are used with examples based on small- and medium-sized businesses, where this is relevant, and that these examples must as far as possible be taken from Danish businesses,
<br>
- that relevant teaching materials are developed at all levels of education,
<br>
- that the teaching materials drawn up in the area of general upper secondary education are extended to also comprise teachers in vocational upper secondary education, as there is a great need there for material about entrepreneurs, which is target-oriented towards upper secondary education, and which is suitable for teaching purposes, and that it is contemplated to use for instance CD-ROM and electronic databases, as it must be possible to change and update such teaching material at regular intervals, and<br>

- that specific materials are drawn up for educational guidance officers in both general and vocational upper secondary education.
<p>
The committee urges:<p>

- that the pupils are to be presented to cases/guest teachers/visits to business enterprises etc. which further their desire and motivation for a more independent attitude. It should therefore as far as possible be younger entrepreneurs who are used as guest teachers. The business enterprises used for visits should be small- and medium-sized businesses. It is important that the examples also represent women entrepreneurs so that both girls and boys can identify themselves with guest teachers as role-models.<p>
<b>
<a name="c">c. In-service training of teachers etc.</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:<p>

- that a special course supply is developed for new teachers in primary and lower secondary education, vocational education and training and upper secondary education, and
<p>
- that already established computer-based networks are used so that the teachers are able to develop experience with teaching methods and cases, including the elaboration of a database on entrepreneurs. This network should also contain a survey of existing and former teachers who have or have had their own business, and who for that reason may be particularly well-qualified as "guest teachers". The network shall be maintained and the database extended at local level - at the individual schools,<p>

- that demands are made for a change in the teacher training offered at the National Institute for the Educational Training of Vocational Teachers so that this training will to a greater extent than is the case today qualify the teachers to develop the attitude potential of the students in connection  with the learning,
<p>
- that a greater awareness is created in the educator training programme with regard to the pedagogical principles etc. which further the development of children's general personal qualities, and
<p>
- that the teacher training programme includes teaching in the independence culture and that special in-service training modules are developed for teachers.<p>

It is the committee's opinion that a pedagogical attitude must be created in upper secondary education in general to the use of teaching forms which are more activating for the participants. It would thus by means of pedagogical days be possible to work with independence culture and entrepreneurs so that the theme could be placed in a broader framework of understanding. Also in this context is it important that presentations are made by committed persons, and that the teachers are - through exercises - given the possibility to experience the independence on their own body.
<p>
The committee urges:
<p>
- that vocational school should as far as possible - when appointing temporarily employed teachers and permanently employed teachers and when organising teacher in-service training in accordance with the order on teacher qualifications - ensure that allowance is made for the teachers' function as advisors and sparring partners,
<p>
- that institutions offering medium- and long-cycle higher education are to appoint external professors, co-finance the visits of prominent visiting professors from abroad and as far as possible make use of existing EU-programmes, and
<p>
- that the need for development and for the compilation and dissemination of knowledge should be seen in relation to network formations - both among the teaching staff at the higher education institutions and between educational institutions and business and industry (cf. item g. below).<p>
<b><a name="d">d. Proposals within the existing framework</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:
<p>
- that the new framework established in vocational upper secondary education for the planning of interdisciplinary teaching is used at local level,
<p>
- that other relevant subjects such as social studies and  technical studies shall be included in general upper secondary education on a par with business economics in the entrepreneurship teaching. It is the aim that all students who choose the optional subject of "business economics" shall get into contact with the entrepreneurial culture and be acquainted with the conditions of the entrepreneur,
<p>
- that the present number of general upper secondary schools, which can take part in the European Business Game, should be increased,<p>
- that the vocational education and training programmes should, when this is relevant, comprise a project-oriented assignment, where the student performs a minor consultancy task for a business enterprise, which functions as the practical training place of the student,<p>

- that the students enrolled in social and health education programmes are provided with the possibility to work with projects regarding the setting up of their own businesses in connection with the ordinary project teaching,
<p>
- that the individually organised youth education and the production schools are involved in the entrepreneurial area, for instance by placing workshop capacity at the students' disposal,
<p>
- that national competitions are established, where students enrolled in relevant higher education programmes are competing against each other with regard to who can elaborate the best entrepreneurial and innovation projects, and
<p>
- that credit-awarding entrepreneurial teaching is established in higher education, where the educational institutions themselves step in and support the development of such courses.
<p>
The committee recommends that the framework provided by the Act on the Folkeskole for the organisation of an interdisciplinary and project-oriented working method is used at local level. The project working method, by which the work may result in individual or common presentations, may be carried out in several ways, e.g.<p>
- all pupils may work with the same theme and with a common problem formulation<br>
- all pupils may work with the same theme but with different problem formulations<br>
- each individual pupil may work with his or her own theme and his or her own problem formulation.<p>
<b>
<a name="e">e. Proposals for new courses of education </a><br></b>
The committee suggests:
<p>
- that when drawing up new education orders a decision is taken on how the course can further the development of the innovative qualifications of the students, and on how the course can give the student knowledge about and an insight into how to start up a business enterprise, <p>

- to increase the effort with a view to developing a basic subject in entrepreneurship complete with teaching material in vocational education and training,
<p>
- that the descriptions of aims and objectives, curricula etc. for all short-cycle higher education courses are given a tone of entrepreneurship and innovation, where it seems relevant to do so,
<p>
- that an open evening school is established for entrepreneurs and others, where the teaching staff consist of young local entrepreneurs,
<p>
- that special optional subjects or profile subjects are developed in the courses in market economics and export technology,
<p>
- that interdisciplinary advanced courses are developed in immediate continuation of the short-cycle higher technical education courses,<p>

- that the possibility is considered of concluding relevant Bachelor-degree courses with a vocational introduction of six months' duration as a combination of a project assignment with practical training in a smaller or newly started business enterprise, <p>

- that a target-oriented pilot course is initiated for engineering students which is directed at product and process development, for instance in industrial innovation,
<p>
- that the business schools establish a diploma course specialisation (HD-course) in entrepreneurship and innovation, 
<p>
- that a short-cycle higher education course is established in innovation and entrepreneurship according to the academy model.1 An Entrepreneurship and Innovation Academy will thereby be established, which may at the same time become a forum, where knowledge is compiled, which may subsequently be channelled back to the relevant educational institutions in a processed form.
<b><p>
<a name="f">f.  Co-operation across institutional boundaries</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:
<p>
- that the vocational upper secondary schools should to a larger extent co-operate across institutional boundaries so that the different qualifications of the students enrolled in higher commercial examination and in higher technical examination courses are integrated into projects about for instance fictive simulation businesses or Young Enterprise, 
<p>
- that there is co-operation across institutional boundaries at local level between general upper secondary schools and vocational upper secondary schools, and that this co-operation also, where this may be relevant, involves schools responsible for vocational education and training and others with knowledge and expertise in the area at local or regional level,<p>

- that the higher education institutions show greater flexibility in their assessment of credit-awarding entrepreneurial courses, and<p>

- that it is stated in the certificates awarded to the students that they have completed an entrepreneurial course, even if no credits are awarded. <p>

<b><a name="g">g. Co-operation between educational institutions and business and industry</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:
<p>
- that a "parent bank" consisting of good contacts to business and industry is established locally at primary and lower secondary schools, general upper secondary schools and vocational upper secondary schools. In the parent circle of the school, there are many good contacts which just need to be asked. It may therefore be a good activity to establish a network between teachers and parents in business and industry,
<p>
- that a "business enterprise bank" consisting of contacts in business and industry wishing to take part in the different activities for teachers and students is established at general upper secondary schools and vocational upper secondary schools,<p>

- that guest teachers and contact persons in businesses are used more consciously at the individual schools, so that the good contacts in and to the individual teachers from business and industry can also be used by other teachers,
<p>
- that vocational schools should function as experience centres for local entrepreneurs so that the schools can in this way contribute to creating an exciting environment of and for entrepreneurs. It should be made possible for local entrepreneurs to use existing workshop facilities etc. against payment for the development and testing of for instance prototypes,
<p>
- that the trade committees, the local school boards and the local education committees are used as a point of departure for the search for and establishment of a "bank" consisting of businesses suitable for visits and guest teachers who can teach management studies and business operation, 
<p>
- that the trade committees, the management of the schools and the school boards should be constantly aware of affiliating newly started business enterprises,<p>

- that the small- and medium-size businesses, which the vocational schools are in contact with, should be able to approach the schools with problems and tasks which pupils and students are given as consultancy assignments as part of their course of study, and<p>

- that trade committees - when approving practical training places - take a decision on whether and how the practical training place can contribute to giving an insight into what it is all about to start and run one's own business.
<p>
The committee recommends that the Ministry of Education takes the initiative to draw up - in co-operation with the Ministry of Business and Industry - a profile for how the co-operation between vocational schools and local business and industry can be implemented in this area. Such a co-operation should, if possible, lead to the elaboration of an inspiration report. It should furthermore be considered whether the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Business and Industry should jointly - on application by the schools - award a prize or a special distinction to one or two schools, in those cases where the co-operation between a school and business and industry may stand out as an inspiration to other schools.
<p>
<b><a name="h">h. Right to continuing training as an entrepreneur</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:
<p>
- that anyone who has completed a vocational education and training course, an agricultural training course or a social and health education course at level 2 is entitled to an entrepreneurial course for up to 5 years after he or she has completed his or her education. A special "diploma" is awarded on completion of the course, and
<p>
- that anyone who has completed a short-cycle higher education course and a relevant medium-cycle higher education course is entitled to a entrepreneurial course for up to 5 years after he or she has completed his or her education.
<p>
<b><a name="i">i. Network formations</a><br></b>
It is the view of the committee that the model which is most likely to succeed consists in the establishment of three types of networks as part of a development process which may result in the establishment of some form of centre. The three types of networks comprise:<p>
the formation of networks between educational institutions, networks between teachers and researchers (cf. item j.) and networks for and between pupils/students enrolled in different courses of education.<p>
The committee therefore suggests:<p>

- that financial support is granted for the administration and organisation of interdisciplinary project modules in the form of a 50% co-financing with the educational institutions involved with a view to furthering co-operation between educational institutions,<p>

- that IT-based teaching is established in network contacts with other universities which are far advanced in the area. In this connection, the emphasis must be laid on technology-supported learning, e.g. distance learning,
<p>
- that support is granted so that the developed Joint Project Manager and Innovation Course of the Higher Education Institutions ("L&aelig;reanstalternes F&aelig;lles Projektleder- og Innovationskursus" - the LFPI) can be taken up again and  be offered at a number of other educational institutions,<p>

- that the experience and models developed within IT-based teaching are also made available to the vocational education and training and upper secondary education courses. This may be done as an integrated part of the in-service training course which has been proposed for teachers from these courses of education,<p>

- that the vocational schools, which find that there is a need to do so, create possibilities for the establishment of a network, where pupils and students can meet and exchange ideas and views. This may for instance be done by establishing "idea caf&eacute;s", where persons with good ideas can meet and attend lectures, if any, and
<p>
- that pupils and students at vocational schools, who grapple with plans of setting up their own businesses, should have the possibility to use the above network, but they should in particular have the possibility to use one or several specially trained teachers at the schools as advisors and sparring partners. It should also be possible to use the teaching staff of the vocational schools in the initial phase and the running-in phase, and this should be financed as an income-generating activity. The use of teaching staff at an educational institution, who are known to the pupils and students and with whom they are familiar, may also contribute to breaking the loneliness and isolation typically experienced by entrepreneurs.
<p>
<b><a name="j">j.  Innovation and development funds</a><br></b>
The committee suggests:<p>

- that interested schools within the social and health education sector carry out experiments with projects in the starting up of one's own business, <p>

- that innovation funding is set aside for the implementation of the teaching in entrepreneurship in the Folkeskole,
<p>
- that experience, from the initiated development programmes, with interdisciplinary teaching and entrepreneurship both in vocational and general upper secondary education is used for a more target-oriented integration of the entrepreneurship theme in the teaching and for rendering it visible,

- that innovation and development funds are set aside in higher education which teachers and researchers with an interest in entrepreneurship and innovation can apply for, so that they are among other things able to carry out study visits abroad and, if necessary, invite researchers from abroad to conferences etc. in Denmark. The funds should be used to support the teaching and the competence in innovation and entrepreneurship and make it possible to carry out experiments, and
<p>
- that these innovation and development funds shall help the educational institutions involved to appoint visiting professors from abroad with expertise in the area in question for short-term employment. These funds can also be used in connection with the appointment of external professors.<p>

As a result of the committee's work, the committee hereby submits this report to the Minister of Education.
