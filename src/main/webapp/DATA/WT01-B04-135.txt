<TITLE>Lois Haight's "The Use of Drugs"</TITLE>
<CENTER>
<H3>CRIMINAL BEGINNINGS: The Use of Drugs</H3>
<H4>Lois Haight, Superior Court Judge, Los Angeles, California</H4>
</CENTER>
<P>
In my courtroom, as in others across California, illegal drugs erode the
foundation of our society.  Drug-addicted parents breed drug-addicted babies who grow up severely handicapped, physically and emotionally.  They later become drug-addicted juveniles who commit serious violent crime as the influence of drugs reduces inhibitions, undermines judgement, clouds
perceptions, and eliminates conscience.
<P>
Since most drug users are in the child-bearing years, the cycle continues
and drug-compromised adults face the crucial job of child-rearing, while at the same time dealing with the consequences and the side effects of hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia, physical aggression, impulsive behavior, memory loss and depression.  These factors include good parenting.  Drug
using parents who come before me are routinely diagnosed as having
amphetamine or cocaine induced delusional disorders, as being gravely disabled, or unable to provide self and family with food and clothing.  They are a danger to themselves and others, and they often have 4 to 6 children.
<P>
The description of cocaine or methamphetamine addicted babies most often
reads something like this:  incessant crying, respiratory breathing problems,
rigidity of limbs, blindness, lack of muscle control, inability to sit up or crawl, developmentally disabled, and sometimes retardation.  I have watched these children go back and forth between the homes of addict parent
and new foster homes where they try to care for the severely handicapped
child and often give up. This child then grows up how? -- abused? molested? neglected?  Is it any wonder that these youngsters turn to drugs and crime?  Without values, without consistency of love and care, they have learned to use and to abuse.
<P>
Approximately 90% of abused, neglected, abandoned and molested children in
Los Angeles alone are the result of substance abuse.  These are dysfunctional
families in the real meaning of the word.  This is a phenomenon that we as a state cannot afford. People who use drugs undermine not just their own lives, but make victims of us all as they destroy future generations, overrun our hospital and health care facilities, cause carnage on our highways, and
destroy our cities and neighborhoods as they join gangs, commit crimes and
victimize law-abiding citizens.
<P>
We have laws to ensure some minimum level of behavior that is universally
recognized as being essential for a civilized society.  It is a futile exercise to suggest that crime can somehow be eliminated or the behavior of a drug user changed by redefining it as legal -- as if a criminal act had no inherent danger other than the fact that it has been placed in the law books of our nation.  To legalize this behavior is to condone it and undisputably increase the behavior.  This we cannot tolerate!  More importantly, laws are the reflection of the values of society.  The seriousness with which we hold those values is measured by the penalty imposed when those values are violated. Therefore, I ask you, how do we value our children when illegal drug use is not viewed as the destroyer it is when the penalties for drug use are insignificant?  How can we expect a minimum level of behavior in our children, when we send the message that drug use is not harmful or wrong?
<P>
Drug treatment has not been a panacea, with less than a 25% success rate.
We must do everything in our power to prevent and deter the use of drugs, because the high is extremely powerful, and the desire for it almost impossible to stop.
<P>
In 1988, I chaired the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America.  That
conference held hearings throughout the United States with five thousand principals and over one thousand recovering addicts participating.  Every drug user gave the same heartfelt message, "Make it difficult, very difficult to use, because if you don't, the lure and seductiveness of the "high" will prevail."
<P>
There must be a down to drug use.  We must always consider and encourage
treatment and recovery, but sanctions should be commensurate with and reflect the harm drug use does to society.  We live in a democracy with freedom to make a choice and freedom to choose consequences.  Those who use drugs make their own choices.  For some, the choices are more difficult than for others, but there are many free-will choices made before one becomes an addict. There must be sanctions for drug use.  When people are considering that choice, considering giving their lives over to drugs, the penalties for the use must have a significant impact on that decision.
<P>
Drug use is clearly the beginning of crime for the users and the abused who
become the next generation of users and abusers.  Stop the use of illegal drugs, and we will stop much of the crime in California.
