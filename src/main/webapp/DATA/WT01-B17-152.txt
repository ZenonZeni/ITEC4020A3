<a name="trai"><h4>TRAINING CHILDREN TO BE DRUG ADDICTS</h4></a>

Ritalin Can Do It<p>
Ritalin, a drug widely prescribed to control hyperactivity and attention-deficit disorder in children, is now used by 3-5% of all U.S. schoolchildren, most of whom are boys. This means that 10-12% of all boys in the U.S. between ages 6-14 are on Ritalin. Experts at the International Narcotics Control Board in Vienna, Austria, which released a report on worldwide Ritalin use, suggest this could pose long-term risks for teenage addiction and compromised well-being. “Our concern is over-prescription,” said the U.S. representative to the Board.<p>
Worldwide, Ritalin sales grew from less than 3 tons in 1990 to 8.5 tons in 1994; of this, 90% of Ritalin is made and used in the U.S. Helping this trend along is Ritalin’s maker, Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical company with U.S. branches. Ciba-Geigy makes considerable financial contributions to Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder, a prominent parents’ group that supports the widespread use of Ritalin to control troublesome children.<p>
A study of 1000 U.S. pediatricians found that 70% use Ritalin as a diagnostic “litmus” test to see whether children have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This procedure too often results in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. If the children respond, they must have ADHD. Doctors overuse Ritalin because of time pressures, failure to do a thorough patient workup, and the need to get children treated and out of the office quickly. New studies indicate that  high doses of Ritalin can produce cancer in mice.<p>
It’s not only Ritalin that may be making addicts of children. Drug dependency starts in childhood with over-the-counter (OTC) medications, admitted the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 1994. Interviews with 8145 mothers of 3-year-old children revealed that, in a one-month period, 53% had received OTC drugs, most commonly Tylenol (66.7%) and cough/cold medicines (66.7%). Of these children, 40% received 2 drugs concurrently, while 5% received 3-4, and 15% received anti-diarrheal medications even though they are not recommended for young children.<p>

<a name="got"><h4>GOT MILK?</h4></a>

Monsanto May Be Bringing You Cancer<p>
Ever since recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH) was approved by the FDA in 1993 for injection in dairy cows to increase milk yield, consumers have been alarmed about its possible negative health effects and the lack of solid scientific support for its safety. Many have also been outraged by the FDA’s failure to require dairies to label milk and milk products as being derived from rBGH-treated cows. <p>
Interest among dairy farmers in using rBGH is dropping off as 87% of those not yet using the hormone do not plan to ever use it and only about 12% of American dairy farms are currently employing it. Meanwhile, the 14-nation European Union has banned its use and Canada has called for a 2-year moratorium on its further use in that country. <p>
So the news that “converging lines of evidence” now incriminate rBGH “as a potential risk for both breast and gastrointestinal cancers” should be the catalyst that gets the FDA to ban the substance from American milk. That is, if they can free themselves from suspected insider connections with Monsanto and several other chemical companies that make rBGH.<p>
In a new study published in the International Journal of Health Services, Samuel S. Epstein, M.D., chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and professor at the University of Illinois Medical Center, both in Chicago, Illinois, states that “with the active complicity of the FDA, the entire nation is currently being subjected to...large-scale adulteration of an age-old dietary staple by a poorly characterized and unlabeled biotechnology product.” The result may be major potential public health risks for the entire country, Epstein suggests.<p>
The problem with rBGH is that it contains a hormone common to cows and humans called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor). IGF-1, normally found in the human body, causes cells to divide and grow, but when extra amounts enter the human body in the presence of milk protein, the body is unable to destroy it, and it is absorbed by the colon, which is known to have cell receptor sites for IGF-1. The hormone is also known to promote the growth of breast cancer cells. At least 17 scientific studies published  since 1991 argue that rBGH milk  may have cancer-producing effects.<p>
Monsanto studies prepared for the FDA indicate that the IGF-1 levels in cows injected with rBGH can rise by a range of 25-70%. But independent European studies say that rBGH milk may contain a 10-fold increase in IGF-1. High IGF-1 levels are particularly dangerous for infants and young children, states Dr. Epstein. “The FDA has dismissed these concerns without investigation and on the basis of unpublished ‘confidential’ short-term toxicity data, primarily from an industry consulting firm with a tainted track record,” Epstein says.<p>
Got milk? Better wipe that coy milk mustache off your face, because rBGH milk may be the Trojan horse that brings cancer into your body. One day the FDA will have to answer to Americans for this serious lapse in judgment. <p>

<a name="what"><h4>WHAT SENDS AMERICANS TO THE  DOCTOR’S OFFICE?</h4></a>

Americans make about 1.5 billion office visits to doctors every year, reported American Health  in December 1995. For respiratory problems, colds, and bronchitis, Americans make 187 million visits (10% of total); hypertension and heart disease represent 147 million; migraines and eye problems, 146 million; arthritis and backaches, 95 million; prostate and bladder infections, 94 million; mental illness, 85 million; ulcers and digestive and bowel diseases, 70 million; thyroid and endocrine problems, 69 million; skin problems, 68 million; infections and parasitic diseases, 47 million; and cancer and benign tumors, 46 million.<p>

<a name="no"><h4>NO STANDARD OF CARE IN CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE</h4></a>

Just Whatever the Market Can Bear<p>
The numbers of doctors, the rates of surgeries performed, and the costs to patients can vary greatly depending on the geographic region, according to the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, the product of 10 years of research. <p>
Cities with the highest medical costs also have the highest number of physicians and hospitals, clearly suggesting that the supply determines the demand and cost. For example, Medicare costs per person on a fee-for-service basis were $5966 in Miami, Florida, but only $2729 in Lincoln, Nebraska. Annual Medicare reimbursements to doctors for their services and lab tests were $2380 per person in Miami, but only $585 in Minneapolis. Per capita costs for hospitalized acute care varied from the high of $1475 in Chicago to a low of $856 in Portland; the national average is $1049. <p>
Regarding mammograms, in Lansing, Michigan, 34.7% of female Medicare enrollees had one or more, while in Oklahoma City, only 13.1% had them. Among women eligible for Medicare, the proportion of  mastectomies performed that were breast-sparing ranged from 1.4% to 48%, depending on geographical location. Rates of coronary artery bypass grafting ranged from a high of 8.5 per 1000 Medicare enrollees in Joliet, Illinois, to a low of 2.1 in Grand Junction, Colorado. <p>
The rate of back surgery and prostate biopsy, depending on region, varied by a factor of 7; a man with early prostate cancer was 4 times as likely to have his prostate removed in Salt Lake City than in New York City. The study also showed that an area with more surgeons means more surgeries will be performed regardless of need.<p>
The astonishing degree of geographic disparity in conventional medical treatment raises reasonable questions as to whether there is a uniform standard of care or if treatment is based on what the local market can pay. The statistics “explode the myth that this country has a ‘health care system,’” comments John E. Wennberg, M.D., leader of the Dartmouth study’s research team. There is no evidence that patients are the source of these “wide variations in every part of the health care system” or that spending more on medical services actually leads to better health, Wennberg says.<p>

<a name="how"><h4>HOW TO WASTE 59% OF HEALTH CARE COSTS</h4></a>

Conventional Medicine Does It Best<p>
As much as 59% of conventional inpatient care commercially provided for people under 65 may be medically unnecessary, as is 49% of Medicare-provided inpatient care, according to a 1994 study by Milliman & Robertson, Inc., a health care industry consulting firm. The figures for unnecessary commercial care ranged from 43% in Portland, Oregon, to 69% in New York City, while for Medicare services, it ranged from 25% in Salt Lake City to 63% in New York City. <p>
An earlier Milliman & Robertson study (1991) estimated that for patients under age 65, 53% of time spent in hospitals is medically unnecessary, as are 24% of hospital admissions and 15% of doctors’ office visits. The highest rates of unneeded hospital stays were in New York (65%), Chicago (62%), and Miami (61%). Los Angeles had the highest rate (36%) of unneeded outpatient office visits. “Health care costs can be significantly reduced by first eliminating unnecessary care,” the new report concludes.<p>

<a name="dent"><h4>THE DENTISTS’ COWARDLY POLITICS OF MERCURY</h4></a>

Don’t Ask; We Won’t Tell You.<p>
A civil lawsuit was filed in 1995 in Santa Clara, California, by a man who claimed he sustained injuries related to his exposure to mercury from his dental amalgams. He filed his suit against his dentist, two amalgam manufacturers, one distributor, and the American Dental Association (ADA). In response, the ADA adroitly bailed itself out from all responsibility to practicing dentists and the public in general.<p>
The ADA told the Court that it “owes no legal duty of care to protect the public from allegedly dangerous products used by dentists.” As it does not make or install mercury fillings,  the ADA claimed it does not control those who do. Therefore, its “only alleged involvement in the product was to provide information regarding its use,” but this does not “create a duty of care to protect the public from potential injury.<p>
The Court agreed with the ADA and dismissed it from the case, leaving all the dentists in America swinging in the breeze without the defense of organized dentistry for their continued use of mercury. According to Michael Ziff, D.D.S.,  of the Foundation for Toxic Free Dentistry in Orlando, Florida, “the hope that use of dental amalgam can be defended on the basis that it is a legally approved dental device, accepted and classified by the FDA, is a hollow dream.” The FDA (and the ADA) has never accepted or classified mixed dental amalgam, but rather has classified “dental mercury” and “amalgam alloy” separately. <p>
In fact, both ADA and FDA officials argue that insofar as dental amalgam is a “reaction product” made by the dentist, sole responsibility for it rests with the dentists. “All of this adds up to one conclusion,” says Dr. Ziff. “If there ever is a legal liability for placing dental amalgam into humans, the practicing dentist has been left holding the bag.” It gets even worse, says Dr. Ziff. <p>
The FDA classifies mercury as a drug in its First Aid Materials regulations. “Since scientific documentation has clearly proven that mercury is released from mercury dental amalgam [in a person’s teeth] on a daily basis and does accumulate in human tissues over time,” says Dr. Ziff, “the placement of dental amalgam constitutes implantation of a time-released highly toxic drug into humans. Legal precedent has established that in any other medical circumstance, this cannot be done without informed consent.”<p>
With the ADA exempting itself from any legal duty to protect the public from dangerous dental products, this leaves only the state Boards of Dentistry. Many of them ignore this charge and harass dentists who inform their patients of the dangers of mercury fillings. State Boards are now caught in the web of their own cowardly politics. “In view of the FDA’s refusal to accept and classify dental amalgam, the Boards are faced with defending punishment for opposition to a dental device that has no legal acceptance,” says Dr. Ziff. <p>
What they should be doing, according to their legal mandate, is protecting the public from dangerous dental products, such as mercury, says Dr. Ziff. This means that if a dentist or a patient protests a case of harassment by the state Dental Board to the governor or state legislature, the Dental Board will have to defend its actions “without benefit of scientific documentation or the support of organized dentistry,” Dr. Ziff explains. Given enough consumer complaints, that could be enough to bring down the edifice of mercury-based dentistry.<p>
