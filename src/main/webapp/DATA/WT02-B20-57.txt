<B><I> Could anyone point me to some recent reviews that focus on the
relative costs of special versus integrated classes, in relation
to the benefits for exceptional children?  I am looking for
objective, balanced evaluations.</B></I><P>

relative cost of inclusion.  At the end of the file are links to Internet resources and Internet listservs (discussion groups) where you can obtain more specific information on the topic. There may be an ERIC digest that provides further information on this topic.  You can

  Does Inclusion Cost More? The Cost of Special Education.<BR>

  Whether inclusion will produce resource economies for school districts is
difficult to determine.  Districts that have developed inclusive models have
reported mixed results.  There appear to be no savings in personnel costs,
although some overall reduction in transportation expenditure has occurred.  Inclusion
demands a more fluid approach to resource allocation.  (18 references)

  Compares costs (for instruction, administration, transportation, and staff
development) related to inclusive programs in four pilot elementary schools
with costs for traditional special education services in nine other elementary
schools in the Greater Clark (Indiana) School District.  The fiscal analysis
found both programs equally cost-effective.  When implementing inclusion, staff
development should be given priority and extra funding.  (MLH)<BR>

  Describes mainstreaming at the Dowling Urban Environment Learning Center in
Minneapolis, Minnesota--a fully inclusive, racially mixed, K-6 magnet school
that is expensive but well worth the cost.  This school has a clear purpose,
few signs of emotional exhaustion among staff, and little depersonalization.  Dowling's
ambience is in marked contrast to an ineffectively managed middle
school described in the September 1994 "Kappan." (MLH) <BR>

  Mara Sapon-Shevin and Jim Kauffman debate the potential and pitfalls of the
inclusion movement.  Sapon-Shevin enumerates the benefits of inclusion
accompanied by adequate resources, support and commitment, teacher preparation
time, restructuring, and staff development.  Kauffman insists that alternative
settings are necessary for some students and deplores "dumping" kids,
regardless of need, into regular classrooms to save money.  (MLH)<BR>

  This investigation examined longitudinal cost data of one school district's
movement toward more inclusive practices.  Findings included district costs
were significantly less than comparable costs for out-of-district services;
numbers of students with severe disabilities significantly increased over a
five-year period; and contractual (related services) costs doubled over the
period.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Profiles teachers' everyday experiences at a southeastern Texas middle school
that mainstreams most of its special needs students.  Classroom observations,
accompanied by teacher and student survey data, showed that mainstreaming had
deleterious effects.  Since teachers spent a disproportionate amount of time
serving special education students, regular students received less individual
assistance, parent-teacher contacts, and lesson preparation time.  (MLH)<BR>

  To obtain information about costs, University of Maryland researchers
interviewed special education directors, principals, and other administrators
in 14 schools or districts committed to including all students with
disabilities.  Respondents identified five affected areas: teachers and
instructional assistants, transportation, facilities, materials and equipment,
and professional development.  Inclusion has startup costs but is probably
cost effective over time.  (MLH)<BR>

  The following models targeting at-risk elementary students are compared for 
cost: (1) Success for All (Robert Slavin), (2) Accelerated Schools (Henry 
Levin), and (3) School Development Program (James Comer).  The Slavin model is 
the most costly in expenditure, and the Levin model requires the most 
additional staff time.  (SLD)<BR>
