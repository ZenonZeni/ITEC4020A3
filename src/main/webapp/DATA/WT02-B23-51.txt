<H1>Great white shark attacks<BR>
California scuba diver 40 feet underwater</H1>
Victim mirculously escapes serious injury, but new questions raised about u/w scooters</CENTER><P>


	A remarkably cool-headed diver operating a small electric scooter 40 feet underwater on California's Monterey coast June 30 escaped with only minor injuries after being attacked by a large great white shark.  The incident occurred in the late afternoon while Marco Flagg, 31, an electrical engineer from Moss Landing, Calif., and two friends,  Steve Larson and a woman who requested her name not be published,  were recreational scuba diving in calm waters from a 13' Zodiac inflatable in 90  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="scooter.gif" ALT="[underwater scooter]">feet of open water 200 yards off of Blue Fish Cove, a popular dive site in the waters of Point Lobos State Reserve just south of Carmel. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

	About 5:20 p.m., Flagg, who holds both a PADI Advanced Open Water and a NOAA working diver certification, and is a veteran of more than 300 dives (including Cape Horn, the Arctic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean), was on his second dive of the day, trying out Larson's scooter. "We had already done a 40 minute dive earlier that afternoon and conditions were very good," he said. "Flat calm, no swell with visibility ten feet at the surface and improving to about thirty on the bottom. The sea floor consisted of rocky outcroppings interspersed with sandy channels. No kelp was in the immediate vicinity. <P>
	 "About two minutes into the dive on a descent angle of twenty degrees I was down about fifty feet when I looked to my right and saw about twenty feet away a massive pectoral fin attached to a torpedo-shaped body of a large fish. That was at the edge of my visibility and the approximately five-foot section I saw did not include the dorsal fin or any part forward of the animal. It disappeared from view about two seconds later." <P>
 	Stunned by what appeared to be a white shark, Flagg immediately turned and headed back toward the boat maintaining a steady rate and shallow ascent angle. "I didn't want to provoke an air embolism or surface far from the boat since I knew many attacks occur on the surface." <P>
	Though apprehensive, the diver felt the odds were good that the shark was most likely just passing and would not attack: "Some of my dive buddies had seen sharks out there. I have a somewhat strange sense of humor but I was calm enough to think to myself 'Gee, and I got to see it without paying for a shark diving trip.' <P>
<CENTER><B>Massive, wide open mouth</B></CENTER><P>
	About 20 seconds after the sighting, Flagg was at 40 feet when he looked down and to his left. "I saw the massive, wide open, near circular, teeth-lined mouth of an animal coming at me and I thought 'Oh shit!' And a second later I felt a severe but dull pressure on my body." <P>
	An instant later (about two seconds, Flagg estimated)  the shark released its grip, freeing him.  Showing remarkable presence of mind, he reached down to make sure his legs were still intact, then continued upwards with the scooter at full throttle,  surfacing about 20 yards from the Zodiac. Reaching the boat, he opted to drop the scooter rather than try to lug it on board. Fearing attack at any second and not knowing the extent of is injuries, Flagg jettisoned his 22-lb. weight belt and quickly removed his tank, buoyancy compensator and regulator assembly. Climbing into the boat, he was attempting to haul his gear aboard when he fell back into the water. Scrambling back aboard as quickly as he could, Flagg immediately started the outboard engine and began revving it in neutral in short bursts as a warning to his companions still beneath him. <P>
	"I felt a dull pain in my gut but since I was still conscious I thought there was no big loss of blood. Steve surfaced three-to-five minutes later, and I told him I had been attacked. He handed me his video camera but it later fell back into the water due to an attached weight belt." LeCompte quickly came aboard. Anxious moments followed as the pair continued revving the motor. Several minutes later she surfaced, needing no warning to scramble aboard. She, too, had seen the shark, describing it "like a freight train going by underneath me." She had sought safety atop an underwater pinnacle until she felt safe enough to swim for the Zodiac. <P>
	Leaving the buoy in place to mark the location of the jettisoned gear, the trio proceeded immediately back to the boat ramp at Whaler's Cove, just around the corner from Blue Fish cove. Flagg managed to climb out had to sit down, feeling too weak to stand. <BR>

	"He was amazingly lucky," said State Park Ranger Jerry Loomis who meet the divers at the ramp and radioed for paramedics. "And incredibly brave to handle himself the way he did." Loomis helped remove Flagg's quarter-inch thick Fathom  Wet suit (blue/black) and assist paramedics. "He was conscious but a little shocky. The left leg was oozing blood, and there was a pretty good puncture wound in the left shoulder but he wasn't bleeding much. His swim trunks had an obvious cut across the crotch but it didn't hit his genitals." <P>
	Flagg was transported to a hospital in Monterey where he received 15 stitches for bite injuries to his thigh, torso, and shoulder and released the following morning. <P>
	The attack was not the first to occur in Monterey Peninsula waters. In 1981, knee boarder Lou Boren was fatally attacked while surfing in Spanish Bay. Four years later, in Monastery Beach adjacent to the Pt. Lobos Reserve, free diver Frank Gallo, of Los Altos, California was bitten underwater, sustaining severe wounds that required more than 600 stitches. In 1990 off the same beach a Santa Paula, California woman survived a large bite on the leg. <P>
	"I'm extremely lucky, I guess," Flagg said during an interview from his Moss Landing office three days later. The German-born, naturalized U.S. citizen explained he had already written a detailed (and notably dispassionate) incident report that he intended to make available to the scientific and research community. Flagg had already turned down numerous interview requests from the tabloid press in the U.S. and overseas. <P>
	Subsequent examination of Flagg's dive gear revealed bite marks on the air tank and on the DiveTracker instrument console that had been attached on the high pressure hose hanging near the left side of his abdomen. The console is housed in a 8" x 3.5" x 2.5" aluminum box made of 1/4-inch thick aluminum. Thus, it appears Flagg had been sandwiched between, and protected by, the metal, which distributed the force of the bite. Flagg noted in his written  Ironically, the console is manufactured by Desert Star Systems, a small company that manufacturers underwater sonar-based navigation systems for scientific, military and commercial users, as well as sport divers - of which Flagg is the proprietor. <P>
At the time of the attack, Flagg's buddy Steve LeCompte was using a sports version of a DiveTraker navigation console. Flagg: "Steve was able to use the instrument to come right back to the boat. That made him very happy." <P>

In the aftermath, some in the commercial fishing community wondered if the scooter- either its noise or electromagnetic field - may have attracted the shark. Last December 9 off San Miguel Island, Santa Barbara urchin diver Jim Robinson,42, had been using a scooter just before he was fatally attacked by a white shark. Robinson had surfaced alongside his boat following a dive and had passed the scooter up to a crew member when he was fatally attacked by a white shark. <P>
	Scooters have been used by urchin divers for about six years to efficiently scout the sea floor for areas where urchin bed are the thickest.  But Flagg himself doubts such a connection: "My simple suspicion is that it was hungry and I just happened to run across its path. Incidents such as mine are so rare that it's impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions. <P>
	"The shark did not attack the scooter, but my mid-section," Flagg continued. "From what I understand, the shark's final approach is guided by sensing electrical fields using sensors in its snout [isle of Langorhams]. And while it's true that a  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="console.gif" ALT="[photo of console]">scooter emits a strong DC  field, that field is uniform. I would suspect the animal is not attracted to field strength but to its variability. Because many things in the water, such as dock and harbor structures, generate a DC field. This contrasts with a field generated by an animal, like one with a heartbeat, is very erratic."<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

	However, some observers are beginning to suspect there may be a connection between scooters and white shark behavior. Dr. John McCosker of the California Academy of Sciences and a world authority on white sharks, recalled in 1980 having to release back into the wild a healthy baby great white shark (nicknamed Sandy, captured four days earlier) that begun bumping into the wall of the Steinhart Aquarium's Roundabout tank where an electronics expert subsequently  detected a minute, and static, electrical anomaly (about .125 millivolts) between two of the tank's windows. <P>
	McCosker also sites  his experiences studying the creatures <I>in situ </I>on Australia's Great Barrier Reef: "I've watched sharks come up and mouth the shark cages in a funny way. Not attack them, but mouth them in a way suggesting it is part of a bioelectric stimulation. Have we demonstrated it? No. But let me put it this way:  If a scuba diver forty feet down gets bitten, I would probably raise my eyebrows and ask What gives? Because that's almost unheard of. But  Flagg was forty feet down and holding on to a device pulsing an electrical DC field and making a noise, as it apparently did, that might incite a shark to mouth and bite, as it apparently did. That leads me to suspect that the scooter was probably contributory, but in ways we don't know. All the additional variables and attractive stimuli - sound, visual, electronic - complicate the issue. Sort of like Murder on the Orient Express. There are so many possible culprits. <P>
	Moreover, just how steady a scooter's DC field is in actual field use may also be open to question. Most scooters have three speed settings which divers routinely change during a dive. And each of these settings can result in a varying DC field as the battery runs down. Elsewhere, in recent years, commercial divers, especially abalone divers Northern California, have reported incidents of sharks being attracted to certain types of sound frequencies generated by marine equipment such as boat propellers. <P>
	Indications are some in the commercial fishing community, especially since the death of urchin diver Robinson, are not waiting for science to solve the mystery. Santa Barbara-based fisheries consultant (and Marine Watch correspondent) Mick Kronman reports that many area urchin divers are dumping their scooters. "Diver Ward Motyer, (who brought Robinson aboard his boat and tried unsuccessfully to save him) told me nobody before said scooter might attract sharks, but they're talking about it now. I'd say a significant number of stopped using them." <P>
	As for his own diving future, Marco Flagg said the incident would not deter him from diving again in those same waters - "the statistics show the probability of an attack on myself or anyone else there is extremely remote." <P>
