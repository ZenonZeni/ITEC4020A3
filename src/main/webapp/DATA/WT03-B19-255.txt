Land and property
</H1>

A generous supply of moderately priced, well located and fully serviced 
industrial land gives Melbourne a clear competitive advantage over most other 
major centres in Australia and overseas. A wide range of greenfield industrial 
sites is available within 20 kilometres of Melbournes central business 
district, with full access to electricity, gas, water, sewerage, drainage 
and telephone services. 
<P>
Well located office and commercial space with all 
modern facilities is available throughout Melbourne at competitive rentals, 
with new space becoming available regularly.
<P>
Office rentals in Melbourne are lower than those in other leading financial 
centres around the world, and are significantly lower than rental costs in 
Sydney, Australia's other major commercial and industrial centre. Industrial 
rentals are also significantly lower in Melbourne than in Sydney.

<B><I>Planning and Environment regulations</B></I>
<P>
New development proposals in Victoria must undergo a formal approvals process. 
A simplified zoning and planning permit procedure has been introduced into 
Victoria's planning system to better accommodate manufacturing industry and 
improve the investment climate for industry. Development is controlled by the 
provisions of the Planning and Environment Act 1987, the Environment Effects 
Act 1978, the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and the Environment Protection 
Act 1970. The Victorian Department of State Development co-ordinates 
government and semi-government approvals for private sector development 
proposals, as well as the provision of infrastructure.
<P>
The Planning and Environment Act provides for the creation of municipal 
Planning Schemes, which are administered, in most cases, by the municipal 
authority. Development is controlled largely by the granting of permits, 
subject to conditions which must be met to the satisfaction of agencies such 
as the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the Department of State Development, 
the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) and VicRoads.
<P>
If a development is prohibited by the relevant Planning Scheme, the developer 
may ask the municipality for an amendment to that scheme - a rezoning - to 
allow the development.
<P>
The Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act establishes a legal process to list and 
protect threatened plant and animal species and ecological communities. It 
is most relevant where a development is proposed for a greenfield site. 
Proposed developments that might impact on a listed species, community or 
protected flora require a permit from the Department of Natural Resources
and the Environment.
<P>
Developments which generate significant waste discharges to the environment are 
likely to be required to obtain a Works Approval and Licence from the EPA 
under the Environment Protection Act. The Works Approval process ensures that 
decisions on cleaner production options and environment management system 
requirements are resolved before construction. This minimises risks to the 
environment and provides greater certainty for industrial development.
<P>
Other approvals or statements that might be required include a Health Impact 
Statement, a Trade Waste Agreement (for effluent discharged into the sewerage 
system), a Crown Lease of public land, and an Exploration and/or Mining 
Licence. 
<P>
An Environment Effects Statement might be required, at the discretion 
of the Minister for Planning, for projects likely to have a significant impact 
upon the environment.
