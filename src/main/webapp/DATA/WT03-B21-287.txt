<H4>Abstract:</H4><P>Testing Materials Resource Book Online is meant to be a one-stop source of information about standardized tests for use by Psychologists, Speech Pathologists, Teachers and Counsellors. The online catalog of tests lists over 1,000 currently published tests, plus some intervention resources and some texts. If you would like us to ammend one of the test descriptions (submit a mini-review), or have us add a publication to our database just email the information to us. You can email us by selecting the <I><B><A HREF="mailto:mdangus@psychtest.com">mdangus@psychtest.com</A></B></I> link on any of our pages.<P>
This site currently runs to about 1.5 megabytes. The <A HREF="catcont.htm">Resource Book</A> which is the largest part of the site, is a set of HTML files generated from the test database maintained by M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd. A printed copy of <EM>The Testing Materials Resource Book</EM> is available free of charge in Canada ($5.00 prepaid on Mastercard is currently required for international shipments). The printed  Resource Book will never be as current as this on line edition.<P><H4>How to use this site:</H4><P>
The easiest way to locate a specific test is to select the Catalog icon on this page. This link takes you to the Test Catalog contents file. From the contents file you can do a text search using your browser for the test name, or to use the contents file links to quickly locate the test by subject.<P>
If you want to participate in test development in progress, select the Research Department link on this page. You will be presented with descriptions of test item pools under development, and will be offered a chance to contribute an item by emailing it to us. 
<H4>About this site:</H4><P>
Development of this site was initiated in March of 1996. We came to believe that our role as providers of information to the general public and to our colleagues could be filled effectively using the internet. In addition, we believe that there are many other areas of our business that may be adapted to the internet in the near future. Your comments and assistance in this regard will be invaluable. Please let us know what you think of the site. Email us your ideas. A site like this will only work if it is a collaborative effort between us and the people who use the site.<P>
Some parts of the site are still very rough, and require polishing up. We would very much appreciate any comments about typographical or other errors like broken links which you find. To return to this start page from a child page you may select one of the <a HREF="index.html"> M.D. Angus&amp; Associates Ltd.</a> links which occur on every page in this web site.<P>
