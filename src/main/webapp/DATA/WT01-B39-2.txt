<p> The number of inmates held in the Nation's local jails on
June 30, 1994, reached a record high of 490,442. Local jails,
which are operated by counties and municipalities and
administered by local government agencies, housed about a third
of all persons incarcerated in the U.S. at midyear 1994; the
other two-thirds were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The jail population grew by 30,638 inmates between July 1,
1993, and June 30, 1994, the third largest annual increase
recorded since 1983. The 12-month increase was the equivalent of
a 6.7% rate of growth. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics were
collected, the number of local jail employees grew at a faster
rate than the number of inmates. During this period, the number
of jail inmates increased at an annual rate of 7.5%, while the
number of full-time and part-time jail employees grew at an
annual rate of 10%. By midyear 1993, local jails employed an
estimated 165,500 persons. </p>

<p> Highlights </p>

<p> After a decade of record growth, the number of inmates in
local jails reached a high of 490,442 on June 30, 1994 </p>

<p> * The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents
increased from 96 in 1983 to 188 in 1994. </p>

<p> * In 1993, 8 States had over 200 local jail inmates per
100,000 residents: Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307),
Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225), California (222),
and Nevada (215). </p>

<p> * Between 1983 and 1993 the number of jail inmates increased
106%; the total jail staff increased 156%; and the number of
correctional officers grew 165%. </p>

<p> * At midyear 1994 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
was 504,324 inmates, as measured by the number of beds allotted
by State or local rating officials. </p>

<p> * The jail population was 97% of rated capacity. Jail space
increased 93% between 1983 and 1994. </p>

<p> * White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population;
black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non-Hispanics of
other races, 2%. </p>

<p> Factors underlying the growth in the Nation's jail population
included: </p>

<p> * an increase in adult arrests </p>

<p> * a growth in jail admissions </p>

<p> * an increased number of felons sentenced to local jails </p>

<p> * an increased number of inmates charged with or convicted of
drug offenses </p>

<p> * more inmates held in jails because of crowded State or
Federal facilities. </p>

<p> Data sources </p>

<p> The data in this report are based on results from the 1993
Census of Jails and the 1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Every 5
years the jail census collections provide detailed information on
local jail inmates, staff, facilities, and programs. Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.
Beginning in 1982 and in years between each jail census, a sample
of jails has been surveyed to obtain basic information on inmates
and jail capacity. These annual surveys provide national-level
estimates on fewer characteristics than the census. (See
Methodology at end.) </p>

<p> As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or after
adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentence
of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a wide
variety of other categories. </p>

<p> Jails-- </p>

<p> * receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing </p>

<ul>
    <li>readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
        absconders </li>
    <li>* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to
        juvenile authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate health facilities </p>

<p> * hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses </p>

<ul>
    <li>release convicted inmates to the community upon
        completion of sentence </li>
    <li>* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other
        authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and
medical authorities </p>

<p> * sometimes operate community-based programs with electronic
monitoring or other types of supervision. </p>

<p> Not included in the survey or census are inmates in six
States with combined jail and prison systems. At midyear 1994
these States-Alaska (except for 5 local jails), Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont--held nearly 6,000
inmates who were unsentenced or had sentences of less than a
year. These inmates and the facilities that house them are
included in BJS prison statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails also included, for the first time,
seven Federal facilities that perform the pretrial functions of
local jails. Data on these Federal facilities and inmates are
reported separately. (See the section on Federal jails.) </p>

<p> Local jail inmates </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, the Nation's jails held 490,442 inmates, an
increase of 6.7% over the number held on June 30, 1993. The jail
population grew by more than 30,000 inmates during the 12-month
period, the third largest increase ever recorded. </p>

<p> Since 1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a
per capita basis. During this period, the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188. At midyear 1994 about
1 in every 398 adult residents of the United States was in a
local jail. </p>

<p> An estimated 6,725 persons under age 18 were housed in adult
jails on June 30, 1994. Over three-quarters of them had been
convicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminal
court. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed in
juvenile facilities. </p>

<p> Who is a juvenile? </p>

<p> Most, but not all, States define a juvenile as a person under
age 18 who is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction. Exceptions
usually depend on offense severity or an offender's adjudication
history. In the 1993 census and 1994 survey, to achieve reporting
uniformity, jail authorities were asked to report the number of
inmates under age 18. Of the 6,725 total in 1994, 76% were
identified as juveniles tried or scheduled to be tried as adults.
Statutes and judicial practice some- times allow youths to be
held in adult jails. Often juveniles accused of acts that are
crimes for adults may be held in local jails or police lockups,
given certain conditions: </p>

<p> * separated by sight and sound from the general population </p>

<p> * held for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours. </p>

<p> Most confined juveniles are housed in institutions specified
for them. In 1993 about 96,000 were in public and private
juvenile detention and correctional facilities. </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30,
1994, was 479,757, an increase of 2.9% from 1993. Between 1983
and 1993, when separate counts by sex were collected, the average
daily population of female inmates grew at a faster rate (up
11.1% per year) than the average daily population of adult male
inmates (up 7.1% per year). </p>

<p> States with the largest jail populations </p>

<p> In 1993, 5 States incarcerated slightly less than half of all
local jail inmates: California (69,298 inmates), Texas (55,395),
Florida (34,183), New York (29,809), and Georgia (22,663).
Twenty-one States reported a jailpopulation that more than
doubled between 1983 and 1993, with growth ranging from 103% in
Maryland to 264% in Texas. </p>

<p> States that had the largest number of jail inmates per
100,000 residents in 1993 were Louisiana (377), Georgia (328),
Texas (307), Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225),
California (222), and Nevada (215). States with a jail
incarceration rate less than half that of the Nation (178 per
100,000) were Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota (57), Minnesota and
Montana (81), and South Dakota (87). </p>

<p> The number of local jail inmates rose the most in the South
and the least in the Midwest. From 1983 to 1993 the inmate
population grew 135% in the South, 102% in the Northeast, 81% in
the West, and 79% in the Midwest. </p>

<p> For the Nation a declining number of jails held these
increasing numbers of inmates. In 1993 the total of 3,304
facilities was 12 fewer than 5 years before and 34 fewer than in
1983. </p>

<p> Facility size and the percentage of the inmate population
held </p>

<p> A small number of jails held a disproportionate share of the
Nation's jail inmates. About 6% of the jail facilities housed
more than half of all jail inmates on June 30, 1993. Facilities
with an average daily population of 500 or more during the annual
period ending June 30, 1993, held 53% of local jail inmates.
Facilities with an average daily population of fewer than 50
persons comprised 57% of all jails but housed about 8% of all
inmates. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics of local jail inmates </p>

<p> Male inmates made up 90% of the local jail inmate population
at midyear 1994, down from 93% in 1983. An estimated 1 in every
212 adult men and 1 in every 2,048 adult women were held in a
local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, a majority of local jail inmates were black
or Hispanic. White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other
races (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska
Natives), 2%. </p>

<p> Relative to the number of residents in the U.S. population,
black non-Hispanics were more than twice as likely as Hispanics,
nearly 7 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, and over 9
times more likely than persons of other races to have been held
in a local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Hispanic 75,500 290 </p>

<p> Other race 7,700 74 </p>

<p> Note: U.S. resident populations were estimated. Inmate counts
were adjusted for nonresponse and rounded to the nearest 100.
Rates were based on relevant population subgroups. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status, mid-1993 </p>

<p> On June 30, 1993, the most recent date for available data, at
least half the Nation's adult jail inmates had been convicted on
their current charge. Convicted inmates include those awaiting
sentencing, serving a sentence, or returned to jail for a
violation of probation or parole. Between 1983 and 1993 the
reported number of convicted inmates more than doubled (from
107,660 to 226,600). The number of jail inmates awaiting court
disposition also doubled (from 113,984 to 228,900). </p>

<p> In 1993 female inmates were somewhat more likely than male
inmates to have been convicted. Among adult female inmates, 52%
had been convicted on their current charge, compared to 50% of
the male inmates. </p>

<p> Rated capacity and percent occupied At midyear 1994, the
rated capacity of the Nation's local jails totaled 504,324. Rated
capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by
State or local rating officials to each jail facility. During the
12 months ending June 30, 1994, an estimated 29,100 beds were
added. Nearly a quarter of a million beds have been added since
1983. </p>

<p> As of June 30, 1994, 97% of the local jail capacity was
occupied. As measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housed
in jail facilities to the rated capacity, the percent of capacity
actually occupied may have been somewhat lower than 97%. Included
among the total jail inmates were an unknown number of inmates
housed outside of jail facilities--under electronic monitoring,
on house arrest, under other kinds of community supervision, or
temporarily in hospitals or treatment centers. </p>

<p> As a ratio of all inmates to capacity, the percent of
capacity occupied increased considerably after 1983, reaching a
record 108% in 1989 and then falling to 97% in 1993. Since 1989
rated capacity has risen by nearly 137,000 beds, while the number
of inmates has increased by 95,000. </p>

<p> In 1993 the total jail population exceeded jail capacity in
eight States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p> Percent of jail </p>

<p> State capacity occupied </p>

<p> --------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Virginia 160% </p>

<p> South Carolina 124 </p>

<p> District of Columbia 121 </p>

<p> New Jersey 120 </p>

<p> Texas 115 </p>

<p> California 113 </p>

<p> Massachusetts 106 </p>

<p> Washington 102 </p>

<p> Pennsylvania 101 </p>

<p> In eight other States, excluding Alaska, the total jail
population was below 75% of the combined capacity of all local
jails. The lowest occupancy rates were in North Dakota (43%),
followed by Wyoming (52%), South Dakota (54%), and Montana (60%).
Between 1988 and 1993 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
increased by 40%, from 339,949 beds to 475,224. In eight States
the capacity of local jails increased by more than 60% during the
5-year period. Jails in New Hampshire and Massachusetts
experienced the largest percentage increase in capacity. During
this period the combined capacities of jails declined in the
following jurisdictions: West Virginia, Montana, and the District
of Columbia. </p>

<p> In every census year, facilities with the largest average
daily populations have reported the highest occupancy rates. In
1993 occupancy was 111% of rated capacity in jails with an
average population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 67% in
those with fewer than 50 inmates. </p>

<p> The 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> In 1994 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accounted
for 30% of all jail inmates. The jurisdictions were in 12 States:
7 in California; 5 in Texas; 4 in Florida; and 1 each in New
York, Illinois, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Georgia, and Michigan. </p>

<p> New York City's system, with 15 institutions, had the largest
number of facilities. </p>

<p> The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles
County and New York City, together held more than 38,284, or 8%
of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1994, had a
total population of 149,082 inmates, 10% more than the 135,060 a
year earlier. </p>

<p> In 1994, 15 jurisdictions reported having a larger average
daily population than in 1993. </p>

<p> Dallas County, Texas, reported the largest single year
growth--2,123 inmates--and the largest growth from 1988 to
1994--5,494. Shelby County (Memphis), Tennessee, reported the
largest decrease from 1993 to 1994--1,327 inmates. </p>

<p> Local jail employees </p>

<p> Local jails employed an estimated 165,500 persons on June 30,
1993. Including all full-time and part-time, payroll and
nonpayroll staff, the total staff grew by more than 100,000
between 1983 and 1993, an increase of 156%. </p>

<p> The staff total included 117,900 correctional officers, the
employees most responsible for providing a secure environment and
for directly supervising inmates. Correctional officers comprised
about 7 in every 10 jail employees in the 3 censuses, 1983-93. </p>

<p> Characteristics of local jail staff </p>

<p> At midyear 1993 men comprised 70% of all paid jail staff and
76% of correctional officers. Excluded were nonpayroll jail
employees, such as teachers or counselors, who were paid by
agencies other than jails. </p>

<p> Between 1988 and 1993 the female staff in local jails nearly
doubled, from 25,642 to an estimated 48,000. In 1993 nearly a
third of all paid staff and a quarter of correctional officers
were women. The race and ethnic composition of jail staff
remained unchanged between 1988 and 1993. White employees made up
an estimated 71% of the payroll jail staff in 1993, including 69%
of the correctional officers. </p>

<p> Blacks comprised 22% of all employees, including 23% of the
correctional officers. Hispanics accounted for 6% of the total
paid staff and 7% of correctional officers. </p>

<p> Inmate-to-staff ratios, 1993 </p>

<p> From 1983 to 1993 the number of U.S. jail employees increased
156%, as the number of correctional officers went up 165%. Jail
staffs in the Northeast had the largest percentage
increases--more than tripling in 10 years--while those in the
Midwest had the smallest, more than doubling. The South, the
region with the largest number of jail employees, registered the
greatest regional growth (75%) from 1988 to 1993. The West, with
less than half the number of employees in the South, also had the
least growth in staff (50%). Throughout the period, 1983-93, the
jail staff in the Nation and in every region grew more rapidly
than the inmate population. In 1993 jails held 2.8 inmates per
employee. The ratio in 1993 was almost a fifth lower than the 3.4
inmates per employee in 1988. </p>

<p> As a measure of workload, the number of inmates per
correctional officer also declined, from 4.7 in 1988 to 3.9 in
1993. All four regions had decreases in inmate-to-correctional
officer ratios. The West reported the sharpest decline, from 7.1
inmates per officer in 1983 to 5.3 in 1993. The smaller
facilities had fewer inmates per correctional officer (2.4) than
did larger jails (4.6 inmates per officer in the jails with a
1,000 or more inmates). The jails that were operating with an
inmate population at least 10% over their rated capacity had an
inmate-to-correctional officer ratio almost twice that of jails
with less than 75% of capacity occupied. Jails with 91% to 110%
of capacity filled employed a correctional officer for more than
every 4 inmates. </p>

<p> Annual jail expenditures </p>

<p> Local jails throughout the United States spent a total of
slightly over $9.6 billion during the year ending June 30, 1993.
This estimated total (not adjusted for inflation) was more than
double the $2.7 billion spent in 1983. </p>

<p> Approximately 71% of all reporting facilities were able to
provide data on expenditures in 1993. These jails reported total
annual expenditures were nearly $7.8 billion; operating costs,
about $5.5 billion; and capital expenditures, $2.2 billion. </p>

<p> Gross salaries and wages, employer contributions to employee
benefits, purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, and
other current operating costs accounted for 71% of expenditures.
Construction costs, major repairs, equipment, improvements, land
purchases, and other capital outlays accounted for the remaining
29%. In 1988, operating costs made up 78% of all expenditures and
capital outlays, 22%. </p>

<p> Average operating cost per inmate </p>

<p> Excluding capital outlays in 1993, the average cost to keep
one jail inmate incarcerated for a year was $14,667. Over 10
years the cost per inmate had risen 57% from $9,360. (Adjusted
for inflation to 1983 dollars the annual cost per inmate had
decreased by 11%.) The Northeast had the highest average
operating expenditure per inmate ($22,678) and the South, the
lowest ($11,697). Excluding Alaska and the District of Columbia,
average annual operating costs per inmate by State were highest
in New York ( $29,297) and lowest in Mississippi ($7,014). </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> During the year ending June 30, 1993, 647 inmate deaths
occurred in the jurisdiction of the jail authorities who provided
data on such deaths. Although asked to report the death of
inmates under the jurisdiction of jail authorities, regardless of
where the death took place, some facilities could report only
deaths that occurred on the jail premises. In addition, about 10%
of all jails were unable to report whether any inmate deaths had
occurred in 1993. </p>

<p> In 1993 illness was the leading cause of death in local jails
(45%), followed by suicide (36%). Acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) accounted for about 10% of reported inmate
deaths; homicide, 3%; and other causes, 6%. </p>

<p> The death rate among jail inmates fell by more than a third
between 1983 and 1993, from 232 to 149 per 100,000 inmates. While
the rate of death from illness, including AIDS, remained
relatively constant over the period, the rate of suicide declined
sharply, from 129 per 100,000 in 1983, to 85 in 1988, to 54 in
1993. </p>

<p> Federal jails </p>

<p> In 1993 the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained a small
number of detention facilities that functioned as jails. These
were not counted among the city, county, or regional adult
detention facilities called local jails in this report. Local
facilities, however, did hold about 12,000 persons for Federal
authorities, according to data reported by 90% of all facilities.
At midyear 1993 the Bureau of Prisons operated 7 jails, holding
5,899 persons who were awaiting adjudication or serving a
sentence, usually of a year or less. </p>

<p> Inmate demographics </p>

<p> Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates were men, a
slightly higher proportion than in local jails (90%). Seventy-two
percent were white, 25% were black, and 3% were Asians, Pacific
Islanders, American Indians, or Alaska Natives. </p>

<p> Conviction status </p>

<p> Slightly more than half of the Federal inmates were
unconvicted and were awaiting arraignment, trial, or the
completion of their trial. </p>

<p> Facility capacity </p>

<p> The 7 Federal jails had a combined rated capacity of
3,810-the population being 155% of that capacity. The percent
occupied was about 50% higher than that of local jails of
comparable size. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> Eight inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federal
jail authorities during the annual period ending June 30, 1993.
Four deaths resulted from illness or natural causes, two were
suicides, and two were drug overdoses. </p>

<p> Staff </p>

<p> Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, a
higher percentage than the 70% of employees for local facilities.
A majority of the Federal jail employees were correctional
officers. </p>

<p> Overall, there were 2.9 inmates per staff member in Federal
jails, about the same as in local facilities where the ratio was
2.8 inmates per employee. However, the number of inmates per
correctional officer (5.5) was higher than in local jails with
500 to 999 inmates (4.4). </p>

<p> Expenditures </p>

<p> Federal jail expenditures totaled slightly more than $166
million during the annual period ending June 30, 1993, excluding
those at the Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, facility, in operation only a
few months at the time of the census. Gross salaries and wages,
contributions to employee benefits, purchases of food, supplies,
contractual services, and other current operating costs accounted
for 76% of expenditures. Construction costs, major repairs,
equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other capital
outlays made up the remaining 24%. </p>

<p> The average cost to house one Federal jail inmate during the
year ending June 30, 1993, exclusive of capital expenditures was
$22,773, as compared to $14,667 among local jails. </p>

<p> Factors behind the growing jail population </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth of the Nation's local jail
population after 1983 was a rise in the number of arrests from
11.7 million in 1983 to 14.0 million in 1993. Over the 10-year
period, the total number of arrests grew at an annual rate of
1.8%. For some offenses the annual rate of growth was
substantially greater: simple assault (7.6%), aggravated assault
(5.8%), drug abuse violations (5.4%), and weapons violations
(3.9%). </p>

<p> The increase in arrests resulted in a growing number of
admissions to local jails. On June 30, 1993, an estimated 26,800
persons were officially booked and admitted to local jails, and
an additional 9,500 inmates were transferred in from other
facilities or readmitted after having been temporarily released.
The estimated number of new admissions totaled nearly 9.8 million
for 1993, up from an estimated 6.0 million in the annual period
ending June 30, 1983. </p>

<p> Among inmates facing felony charges, the likelihood of being
held in a local jail prior to the disposition of their case
remained nearly the same between 1988 and 1992. Based on the
biennial National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) that
describes State felony defendants in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties, an estimated 37% were held awaiting
disposition in 1992. Roughly the same percentage was detained in
1988 (34%) and 1990 (35%). (Pretrial Release of Felony
Defendants, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [February 1991, NCJ-127202], 1990
[November 1992, NCJ-139560], and 1992 [November 1994,
NCJ-148818]). </p>

<p> More felons sentenced to local jail </p>

<p> The impact of more arrests and jail admissions was compounded
by a growing number of felons receiving a sentence to local jail.
Between 1986 and 1992 the number of convicted felons sentenced to
confinement in local jails almost doubled: </p>

<p> 1986-92 90% </p>

<p> Source: Felony Sentences in State Courts (1986, 1988, 1990,
and 1992). </p>

<p> Jail inmates received about the same average sentences Growth
in the local jail population between 1983 and 1993 was not the
result of longer sentences. Results from the National Judicial
Reporting Program (NJRP) indicate that between 1988 and 1992,
years in which comparable data on felons sentenced to local jails
are available, the average (mean) maximum jail sentence among
those entering jail remained constant. In 1988 and 1992 felons
sentenced to local jail received a mean sentence of 7 months.
(Felony Sentences in State Courts, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [December
1990, NCJ-126923], 1990 [March 1993, NCJ-149077], and 1992
[January 1995, NCJ-151167]). </p>

<p> Data from the 1983 and 1989 surveys of inmates in local jails
also reveal no significant changes in the sentence lengths
received by sentenced inmates overall, including felons and
misdemeanants. About 50% of the jail inmates had been convicted
and sentenced at the time of both surveys. (Profile of Jail
Inmates, 1989, BJS Special Report [April 1991, NCJ-129097]).
Between 1983 and 1989, there was an increase in the mean sentence
(from 14 months to 17 months) but no change in the median. In
both years half of the sentenced inmates had received a sentence
of 6 months or less. </p>

<p> More drug offenders incarcerated in local jails </p>

<p> The largest source of growth among inmates in local jails was
drug law violators. Based on data from inmate surveys in 1983 and
1989, the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of drug
offenses rose from 20,800 to 91,000. In 1983 about 1 of every 10
inmates were in jail for a drug offense; in 1989 nearly 1 of
every 4 were in jail for drugs. From 1983 to 1989 the increase in
the number of persons in jail for drug offenses accounted for
more than 40 percent of the total increase in the jail
population. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1989 the percentage of jail inmates
decreased for violent offenses (from 30.7% to 22.5%) and property
offenses (from 38.6% to 30.0%), but increased for public-order
offenses (from 20.6% to 22.8%). During this period, the total
number of inmates increased in every category: violent offenders
increased from 68,600 to 89,000; property offenders from 86,300
to 118,700; and public-order offenders from 46,100 to 90,200. </p>

<p> Although offense information for more recent years is not
available, estimates may be made using 1989 percentages. Assuming
no change in the percentage distributions, the estimated number
of drug offenders in local jails in 1993 was more than 105,800,
representing a 5-fold increase since 1983. </p>

<p> More jail inmates held for State/Federal authorities </p>

<p> The Nation's jail population also grew between 1983 and 1993
as a result of crowding in State and Federal prisons. On June 30,
1993, nearly 12% of all jail inmates were prisoners being held
for State or Federal authorities. An estimated 53,900 inmates
were held for State or Federal authorities in 1993, up from
17,281 in 1983. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993 the number of inmates held for State
and Federal authorities grew at twice the rate of the inmate
population overall (212% compared with 106%). </p>

<p> Approximately 34,200 jail inmates in 1993 were in local
facilities as a direct result of crowding of State or Federal
facilities (representing 7.4% of all jail inmates). The other
19,700 inmates held for State or Federal authorities were in jail
for other reasons, such as waiting transfer or early release
(pending completion of paperwork or transportation),
participation in special programs, and special security needs. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Census of Jails </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails was the sixth in a series of data
collection efforts aimed at studying the Nation's locally
administered jails. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970,
1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988. As in previous censuses, the U.S.
Bureau of the Census collected the data for the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 census included all locally administered confinement
facilities (3,287) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and are
staffed by municipal or county employees. The census also
included 17 jails that were privately operated under contract for
local governments and 7 facilities maintained by BOP and
functioning as jails. </p>

<p> Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities,
such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after being formally charged in court (usually within 72 hours of
arrest). Also excluded were State-operated facilities in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which
have combined jail-prison systems. Five locally operated jails in
Alaska were included. </p>

<p> The mailing list used for the census was derived from the
National Justice Agency List, which is maintained by the Bureau
of the Census for BJS. The census forms were mailed to 3,506
facilities on June 22, 1993. </p>

<p> Twenty-eight jails were added to the initial mail out, and
230 were deleted, resulting in a total of 3,304 facilities. </p>

<p> After extensive follow-up, including additional mail requests
and repeated telephone contacts, all jails (except those in one
jurisdiction) provided data for four critical data items--number
of inmates, average daily population, rated capacity, and sex of
inmates housed. Data on the these four items for the
nonresponding jails were imputed based on data reported in the
1994 Annual Survey of Jails. </p>

<p> Completed forms with data for all or most items were received
for 2,981 jails, resulting in a 90% response rate. These
reporting jails housed 93% of all local jail inmates on June 30,
1993. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on all
census items except the four critical items, national totals had
to be estimated. The following procedures were used to estimate
totals when data were incomplete: </p>

<p> 1. Each item was first assessed for coverage and internal
consistency. For purposes of estimating the totals, extreme
values were examined and then verified by checking other census
information or calling the respondents. Detailed categories were
also checked to determine if they summed to the reported totals. </p>

<p> 2. To provide a national total, item values were summed and
then multiplied by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF). For
most estimates, the NAF was a ratio of the total number of
inmates in all jails to the number of inmates in jails that
reported valid data. Ratios based on inmate counts were used to
estimate the number of adults, the number of inmates by sex and
age, conviction status by sex, the number of staff by
occupational category and region (tables 11 and 13), and payroll
staff by sex and race. Ratios based on the total average daily
population were used to estimate total expenditures. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Estimates of detailed categories were further adjusted so
        that for each item the sum of the detail equaled the
        estimated total. For example, the estimated numbers of
        male and female adult inmates were ratio adjusted so that
        the final estimates summed to the total number of adult
        inmates. </li>
    <li>All estimates of inmates and staff were rounded to the
        nearest 100. Expenditures were rounded to the nearest
        million dollars. </li>
</ol>

<p> 5. All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions in this
report are based on reported data only. </p>

<p> Annual Survey of Jails </p>

<p> In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey of
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the
Nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 1994 Annual
Survey of Jails is the 10th such survey in a series begun in
1982. The reference date for the 1994 survey was June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Using information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a new sample
of jail jurisdictions was selected for the 1994 survey. A
jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local jails. The sample
included all jails in 796 selected jail jurisdictions and 23
multijurisdiction jails. A multi-jurisdiction jail is one in
which two or more jurisdictions have a formal agreement to
operate the facility. </p>

<p> In drawing the sample for 1994, jail jurisdictions were first
stratified into two groups: single jurisdiction jails and
multijurisdiction jails. All of the multi-jurisdiction jails were
included in the survey. The remaining jurisdictions were then
further stratified into two groups: jurisdictions with jails
authorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails holding
only adults. Jurisdictions were then selected based on the
average daily population in the 1993 census. All jails in 203
jurisdictions were automatically included if the jurisdiction
held juveniles and had an average daily population of 250 or more
inmates in 1993 or if they held only adults and had an average
population of 500 or more. The other jurisdictions (593) were
then selected based on stratified probability sampling. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. After follow-up
phone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the survey
was 100%. </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30,
1994, were produced by sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age group
and for the average daily population during the year ending June
30, 1994. National estimates were also produced for rated
capacity. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> Survey estimates have an associated sampling error because
jurisdictions with smaller average daily populations were sampled
for the survey. Estimates based on the sample survey may differ
somewhat from the results of conducting a complete census.
Different samples could yield somewhat different results.
Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates
from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an
estimate from a particular sample approximates the average of all
possible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for the
total inmate population of 490,442 on June 30, 1994, was 0.50%.
(See appendix tables 1 and 2.) </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine
whether differences between 1993 census counts and 1994 survey
estimates were statistically significant. All differences
mentioned in the report meet or exceed the 95-percent confidence
level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily
population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on
June 30 of each year. The average daily population balances out
any extraordinary events that may render atypical the inmate
count on June 30. The June 30 count provides data on
characteristics of inmates, such as race, Hispanic origin, and
age, that may not be available on an annual basis. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be
incarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances.
Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult to
collect. The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails provides new and more
accurate estimates of the juvenile population. For the first
time, the survey provides estimates of the total number of jail
inmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the number
held as juveniles. New sampling procedures were also introduced
in 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these estimates. By
stratifying jurisdictions based on the authority to house
juveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts were improved. </p>
