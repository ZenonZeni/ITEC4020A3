<B>Rabies Prevention Program 
in the Greater Toronto Area




</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources will live-trap and vaccinate raccoons and skunks in Scarborough and place vaccine baits for foxes in greenbelt areas and ravines between Hamilton and Oshawa as part of a continuing program to control rabies.<P>

The Scarborough program will run from July 2 through to the end of August, while the fox baiting program will run from July 8 through to the end of September.<P>

The trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program in Scarborough will cover a 
60-square-kilometre area bounded by Highway 401 to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, Victoria Park Avenue to the west, and Markham Road to the east.<P>

"We have assigned 10 ministry staff to the Scarborough TVR area," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "They will be setting live-traps, and all captured raccoons and skunks will be tagged for identification, vaccinated against rabies by injection, then released."<P>

MNR is asking the public to leave the traps alone, especially if they contain animals.  The traps will be checked regularly. <P>

The Scarborough TVR program has been so successful that the 60-square-kilometre area has been free of rabies in skunks for more than seven years. Data collected from the program has also enabled the ministry to develop a strategy to keep raccoon rabies out of Ontario.  That strategy is being used along the Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers to block the spread of raccoon rabies into Ontario.<P>

The fox vaccine-bait program covers an area from Hamilton to Oshawa.  The northern boundary from Hamilton to Mississauga is Highway 5.  From Mississauga to Pickering the northern boundary is Major Mackenzie Drive, and from Pickering to Oshawa the northern boundary is Taunton Road. <P>

MNR staff and volunteers will place 40,000 chicken/cod baits containing rabies vaccine in ravines and near fox dens.  Each bait carries a label that reads, "Rabies Vaccine, 
DO NOT EAT," and MNR is asking the public not to touch the packets.<P>

The vaccine is not harmful to humans or to pets and other animals.  However, it will not protect pets and other animals from rabies.  Pet owners should ensure that their pets are properly vaccinated against rabies.<P>
	
Since the fox vaccine baiting program started in 1989, there have been only three cases of rabies in foxes in the Greater Toronto Area.  Metro has been free of rabid foxes for two years.<P>

The goal of the ministry's rabies vaccine programs is to immunize between 60 and 70 per cent of the target animal population against rabies.  MNR research shows that if a high percentage of animals are immunized, a rabies outbreak does not take hold in the animal population.<P>
