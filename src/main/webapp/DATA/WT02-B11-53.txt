<h4><em>SUMMARY</em></h4>








<blockquote><b>The societal background</b><br>

                       We are living in a society characterised by rapid 

change and in which the need for education and training is ever increasing. In 

a global economy, the division of labour is increasingly international, the 

location of manufacturing and services being determined by quality and 





















competitiveness. At the same time, it is a truism to say that technological 

development is accelerating at such a pace that most of the technology which 

will be in use in 10 years' time has yet to be developed.<p>

 Nevertheless, at least 80 per cent of the present workforce will still be 

active in the year 2000.<p>

The pace of development and the increasing demand for knowledge will require 

great flexibility on the part of the workforce, as it will have to adapt 

continually to the demands of changing, or totally new jobs. In order to meet 

these demands, education will have to become a lifelong process in the future.<p>



Our education system - from the primary and lower secondary school (the 

Folkeskole) to higher education - is first and foremost a coherent set of 

self-contained educational provisions for young people. Among other things, 

this is illustrated by the fact t that expenditure on adult education still 

only accounts for 11.8 per cent of the total education and training budget in 

Denmark. Be this as it may, educational institutions have increasingly taken 

on new tasks in relation to new target groups, and in this

 connection have developed novel teaching methods involving the application of 

new technologies.<p>

If we are to sustain our standard of living in the long term, we must be 

prepared to increase the pace with which we adopt new technologies. With the 

introduction of new technology not only in manufacturing but also built into 

the products themselves, production will both embody more knowledge and and 

demand greater knowledge.<p>

If we are to satisfy the needs that technological development brings with it, 

the education system must be restructured so that the provision and 

implementation of lifelong education and training becomes a significant part 

of its priorities. At the same time, educational institutions must be prepared 

to engage in technology-supported learning in cooperation with partners 

outside the traditional education system. New technology-supported learning 

systems - with their potential for tailoring courses to the

 needs of the students, for the delivery of courses to the student's home or 

workplace and at times convenient to the students - will be able to further 

significant elements of this reorganisation of education to support a 

flexible, lifelong learning pattern. Furthermore, they will constitute an 

integral part of overall initial education and training provisions.<p>

<b>
Economic Trends in the Development of Education and Training
</b><br>


In Denmark, education and training accounts for about 7 per cent of GDP and 

about 26 per cent of public sector operational and investment budgets. As 

salaries account for just under 80 per cent, the education sector is extremely 

labour and salary-intensiv salary-intensive compared with most other sectors 

of society.<p>

























Given that teacher salaries increase at the same pace as in society at large, 

costs in the education system - and thus the "price" per student - will 

increase more rapidly than the costs and prices elsewhere. nufacturing.

The reason for this is in part due to the fact that the education sector is 

comparatively labour-intensive, and in part due to the fact that opportunities 

for productivity increases are limited, given the current organisational 

structure of educational provisions.<p>

Simply to maintain current educational standards, we shall thus have to pay 

more for education and training in the future. The committee has calculated 

that, if student numbers and educational standards remain unchanged, 

expenditure on education and training at constant prices will increase from 

approximately 57 billion DKK per annum in 1990 to about 66 billion in the year 

2000 merely as a result of salary increases. Total additional expenditure for 

the ten-year period will be approximately 50 billion DKK.<p>

It is open to question whether such "natural buoyancy" in expenditure will be 

acceptable, or whether demands will be made that educational staff should 

balance gains in their real remuneration with productivity increases, as is 

the case with other groups in society.<p>



It is also by no means clear whether the education sector with its current 

organisation of educational provisions will be able to achieve the required 

productivity gains without an unacceptable reduction in quality.<p>


<b>Technology-Supported Learning</b>
<br>


                             The committee has chosen to define 

technology-supported learning as any form of study where the teacher and 

students are not present on the same premises, and where study is 

systematically and deliberately supported by technology. The concept 

furthermore includes forms of study which are supported by technology, leading 

to changes in the  role of the teacher from that of having control over the 

learning situation to one in which it is the student who assumes 

responsibility for his studies and the teacher acts as a consultant, as and 

when the student feels the need for it.<p>

Study traditionally takes place at the same time (the timetabled lesson) and 

in the same place (the classroom). As opposed to this, technology-supported 

learning may take place at different times and in different places. In 

addition, technology-supported learning leads to significant changes in 

teacher and student roles. The committee has, however, emphasised that the 

courses must have an explicit, pedagogical structure, and that to a certain 

extent study must be supported by a dialogue between the teacher and the 

student and/or among the students themselves.<p>









<b>Three scenarios</b><br>















Taking as its point of departure typical study situations, three scenarios 

have been contructed. Together they constitute a framework for 

technology-supported learning which - in the opinion of the committee - when 

used individually or in combination, wil will cater for substantial areas of 

the Danish education system over a ten-year period. The three scenarios are as 

follows:<p>

<ul>

<li>The time-independent learning model

<li>The simultaneously-distributed learning model

<li>The independent study model (differentiated learning).<p>

</ul>

For each scenario, calculations have been made which show the economic 

consequences of that model compared with those of traditional provisions. The 

costs of both traditional provisions and of the scenarios have been projected 

on the basis of technology o options and trends as we know them today. At the 

same time, it is assumed that new technology-supported learning modes are 

applied rationally and are in everyday, mainstream use. In the scenarios, the 

assumption is also that the cost-intensive development

 phase has been completed and that the inevitable "growing pains" are over.<p>

In the case of the<em> Time-independent Learning Model,</em> one can combine elements 

from classroom teaching with the temporal flexibility of the correspondence 

school. The individual student studies at home or at his place of work, from 

where there is a continual dialogue with the teacher and with the other 

students.<p>



In Denmark, the distance learning dimension, where students work on their own 

or in groups, is normally combined with classroom teaching in the form of a 

limited number of weekend seminars.<p>

The model is well-suited to time-independent learning. Weekend seminars aside, 

it is independent of distance. The time-independent learning model is not, 

however, particularly flexible when it comes to the starting date and 

variations in study load during

 the course.<p>

The model makes relatively big demands on the student's maturity, motivation 

and his ability to work independently. Compared to traditional teaching, the 

course involves predominantly written rather than oral communication. The 

time-independent model makes great demands on the planning and pedagogical 

quality of the course, and highlights the performance of the individual 

teacher and that of the teacher group.<p>



Based on the committee's calculations, the time-independent learning model 

becomes cheaper than traditional direct teaching with student/teacher ratios 

of 20 or more, depending on the conditions. The bigger the student/teacher 

ratio, the greater are the a advantages of the time-independent model. With 























100 students, the costs per student for this model are about 31 per cent lower 

than the costs in a comparable traditional provision. These benefits have not 

been achieved in experiments to date, all of which have been small-scale, but 

they will be feasible in the event of a change-over to large-scale, rational 

and mainstream operations.<p>

In the<em> Simultaneously-Distributed Learning Scenario, </em>students can see and hear 

their teacher. They can also carry on a dialogue with a teacher when studying 

either individually or in groups. Technically, the model builds on satellite, 

cable television or on video telephony (video-conferencing).<p>



Of the scenarios described, the simultaneously-distributed learning model is 

the one which is closest to the traditional teaching mode. Therefore, neither 

the student nor the teacher roles are significantly different from those of 

traditional provisions. This model requires that teaching takes place at dates 

and times which have been agreed in advance. The model is good at overcoming 

the barrier of distance, and it is therefore well-suited when it comes to 

serving thinly-populated areas with a few, small institutions, where it is 

difficult to assure reasonable class sizes. By coordinating and combining the 

teaching of small classes, the range of courses from which the students can 

choose can be broadened. It is, furthermore, well-suited as a means of 

promoting specialisation among educational institutions in various parts of 

the country, and for the education and training of those involved in research.<p>



As regards the start and the progression of such a course, the model 

corresponds to traditional provisions. t an educational institution or at the 

student's place of work.<p>

Given the current situation, it is not economically advantageous for 

institutions to offer entire courses based on video-conferencing technology. 

But the use of such technology has economic advantages, if the teaching of 

small classes is coordinated and combined.<p>

As significant reductions in the prices of the hardware used in the model are 

forecast, the example on which the committee has based its calculations, (an 

entire higher commercial examination course), will become cheaper than the 

corresponding traditional

 provision by the year 2000, if it is implemented in the form of 

simultaneously-distributed learning, and if the educational standard of the 

traditional provision remains unchanged.<p>

In the last scenario - <em>the Independent Study Model </em>- the student, in 

principle, works alone with the subject-matter in an organised sequence of 

modules. The student also works at his own pace, and he must be able to find 

answers to all his questions in the study package. As the last condition is 

difficult to fulfill, in practice the model will frequently be supplemented 

with the option of counsellor support at a study centre.<p>

























Breakthroughs with regard to videodiscs and CD-ROM technology leading to a 

rapidly increasing supply of high-quality material for independent study can 

be expected in the coming years. As the number of units sold in the 

international market will be high, the price of independent study packages can 

be expected to drop significantly.<p>

In principle, the model can operate with unlimited class quotients. In 

practice, however, it is often the case in Denmark that independent study 

materials are used in  study situations where there is still a teacher 

present, and where independent study is

 combined with traditional teaching. In these delivery modes, the teacher role 

changes into that of consultant; the teacher becomes a human resource, to whom 

the students can turn as and when they wish.<p>

Even in the last instance, the model is economically advantageous, as the 

teacher - depending on the quality of the teaching material - can handle 

larger classes than he would otherwise be able to in traditional provisions, 

and because the duration of the

 course can be reduced by about a third. To this should be added that course 

participants have proved better at coping with their final examinations than 

the participants in the traditional provisions.<p>

The independent study model makes great demands of the autonomy of the 

students. At the same time, the teacher role is radically different. In this 

mode, the teacher functions as a counsellor and offers support in connection 

with the students' acquisition

 of study skills. In addition to this the teacher will, if necessary, have to 

put together study units using multimedia materials.<p>


<b>The Recommendations of the Commitee</b>
<br>

Technology-supported modes of learning are well-suited to meet a substantial 

part of future needs for "lifelong learning". At the same time, 

technology-supported modes of learning make it possible to maintain and extend 

the geographical distribution of ed education and training provisions. For 

these reasons, in conjunction with projected trends for the cost of 

technology-supported learning compared with traditional provisions, the 

committee recommends that a coordinated initiative with well-defined 

objectives should now be implemented with the aim of extending 

technology-supported learning provisions in Denmark.<p>



1. All interested parties within and outside the public education system 

should have the opportunity of participating actively in the development of 

technology-supported learning provisions, including provisions leading to 

formal educational qualification qualifications. In this connection,existing 

education and training monopolies should be abolished, and all citizens should 

be given the right to present themselves for publicly recognised examinations, 

even though they are not enrolled in a course at an educational institution. <p>

























Public study grants linked to a unit/credit scheme do not seem to constitute 

an obstacle to a liberalisation which is both characterised by competition and 

which, at the same time, maintains quality criteria in the form of 

examinations. There will also be significant opportunities for fruitful 

cooperation between educational technology specialists, adult and further 

education, and traditional educational institutions. Such cooperation will 

increase the pace at which professional expertise in the use of technology 

support modes of learning is acquired by those offering full-time courses of 

education.<p>

2. An in-service continuing training programme should be initiated for both 

teachers and administrative staff who are to take part in the organisation and 

implementation of technology-supported learning. This programme should be of a 

temporary nature until existing teacher training provisions have been able to 

integrate the necessary skills required to offer technology-supported learning 

programmes. The in-service programme should aim to train a sufficient number 

of staff in order to establish a core of expertise at the institutions 

involved; the committee envisages something of the order of 15-20 per cent of 

the teaching profession taking part in such a course. In the first phase, the 

target group should be schools of vocational education and training, and 

institutions of higher education.<p>

The breadth of the course should be such that it gives an understanding of all 

the scenarios which have been described in this report, and the course 

organisation must include practical exercises. The course should be 

technology-supported in part, so that

 the course participants have the opportunity to gain first-experience of 

these study modes.<p>

Furthermore, the course should be organised so that it caters for all 

categories of teachers. The development of the course should involve both 

companies and organisations with experience in technology-supported learning 

and educational institutions with well-documented expertise in the pedagogical 

in-service training of the target groups in question.

At the same time, existing teacher training programmes and a number courses in 

administration should be reorganised so that in initial education and training 

provisions it becomes possible to acquire professional competence within the 

area of "organisation of technology-supported learning".<p>

3. Funds should be earmarked from public building and equipment appropriations 

for full or partial grants for the purchase of equipment for technology-supported learning. 

Such grants should only be made for initial purchases.<p>



4. A joint national data network should be used which institutions can join 

for a limited period of time free of charge, and which provides a series of 

specific services, including the operation of a conference system or other 

kinds of electronic systems which facilitate network cooperation among several 

users. The service should be supported by a unit responsible for service and 

maintenance,upon which the participating institutions can draw. The operation 

of the network should be supported by public funds. Support should also be 























given to students' use inasmuch as they should only have to call the nearest 

network node and thus pay the local telephone rate.<p>

5. Legislation pertaining to radio and television should allow for the use of 

the public broadcasting network for the transmission of educational programmes 

and data. In addition, the possibility of educational institutions or the 

Electronic University (see below) using the broadcasting network and retaining 

intellectual rights to the educational materials themselves should be 

investigated.<p>

6. A national service centre for the development of technology-supported 

learning should be established. In order to guard against the development of 

an organisation with its own institutional interests, the committee envisages 

a small organisation along the lines of the Danish Research Academy which 

could act as a dynamo and function as a source of inspiration. The committee 

makes the assumption that a considerable part of the tasks will be delegated 

to the education system. In addition, the centre will be given tasks relating 

to the drawing up of development contracts, course schedule monitoring, the 

acquisition of national licences, the importation of foreign teaching 

materials, copyright issues and the like.<p>

Consideration should be given to the question of letting the centre be 

responsible for the dissemination of information about, and the organisation 

of, distance education provisions,in particular those forms corresponding to 

the time-independent learning model. In this connection, the centre should be 

entitled to receive government "taximeter" grants (i.e. grants per enrolled 

student) and subsequently settle accounts with the participating institutions 

on the basis of contracts entered into.

The centre should have a life of ten years. Before this period expires, the 

future of the centre should be assessed with a view to either closing it down 

or changing its terms of reference and maintaining it in a scaled down form. 

We propose that the centre be called "the Electronic University".<p>

7. Partial or total funding should be made available for the adaptation of a 

number of traditional courses to include technology-based learning. There 

should be a broad range of courses organised in this way, to cater for those 

who would no doubt prefer this learning mode, if it were generally available.<p>

The aim of supporting such developments, possibly in the form of co-financing 

agreements, should be to ensure the creation of a broad and coherent 

educational provision within a period of a few years. This would also enable 

institutions to offer a wide and varied range of education and training, in 

particular in the field of formal, vocationally-oriented adult and further 

education in geographical areas where their location makes it difficult to 

offer traditional courses.<p>
