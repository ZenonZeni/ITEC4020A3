HIGH-COST NYNEX WANTS TELEWEST-TYPE SAVINGS

The restructuring plan unveiled on Monday by Nynex CableComms, which
involves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900 strong workforce,
follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is the
least efficient of UK cable operators.

Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs - through a mixture of
sackings, voluntary redundancies and natural wastage - and a saving of
between #7 million and #10 million a year, will enable it to reach
operating cashflow breakeven by the end of this year.

The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts resulted
from a #25 million investment in information-technology systems to
handle areas such as subscriber management and telesales.  The axe is
falling heaviest in sales and marketing, reflecting a move away from
door-to-door sales towards telesales, which Nynex regards as more
efficient (they accounted for a quarter of sales in 1995).

Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who has
just taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his old
role of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, who
drew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officer
Nicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New York
office to undertake a similar role.  There was only one senior
casualty:  Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block of
franchises.

Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industry
analysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UK
operators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs through
economies of scale.

The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing and
administration were 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine months to
end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per cent for
TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.

The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 by
the end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 too
many.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on an
expected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get the
television customers we expected, but the whole industry expected
more.''

In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UK
cable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- the
proportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in the
industry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on the
basis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be the
best, but it is close to the best and, at 30.3 per cent, contrasts
strongly with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.

On the other hand, Nynex's penetration -- the number of subscribers
expressed as a percentage of those who could take the service because
the cable passes their homes -- is much lower than TeleWest's: 18.9 per
cent against TeleWest's 21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8
per cent.  Nynex knows that it must increase its sales, but suggests
that the churn rather than the penetration figures may turn out to be
the biggest contributor to long-term success.

Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.
Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churn
lower and, indeed, has recently increased its spending.  According to
Mearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in terms
of customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we need
to make it more economic.''

Nynex hopes to reduce the cost of sales, marketing and administration
to 50 per cent of its revenue-base by the end of this year, the level
it expects TeleWest to achieve.

Nynex's restructuring could be be seen as part of a wider trend within
the industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general
panic, but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is
still not selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small
restructuring in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.

The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate culture
resulting from the UK company turning itself from a wholly-owned
foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone company into
a public company last June (though major policy decisions still have to
go through the slow process of gaining US approval).

The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuring
represented the opening shots of a new management style: it was purely
a coincidence that the moves were announced during the week of
Connell's departure.

As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up in
the wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &
Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,
before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turn
of the year.

Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-up
behaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel good
about it.''

Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,
Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a good
thing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to put
management resources as close to the franchises being managed as
possible.''

Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even with
the changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end of
the year.

Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves -- Nynex was, after all,
only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.
However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement (Monday
morning), closing at 105p.  It fell further on Tuesday to an all-time
low of 104p.

Nynex plans: Nynex is centralising the management of its three regional
franchise blocks in the south, the Midlands and the Manchester area.
Departmental executives will report to their central chief rather than
to regional bosses.  Nynex believes that one central sales organisation
covering all franchises and focusing purely on sales is more efficient
than having sales undertaken regionally and combined with marketing.

The main information system which is provoking the staff cuts is the
IBM-based ICMS integrated cable-television and telephony subscriber-
management system, which the company introduced last year.

The company is also adding a workforce-management system, designed to
improve efficiency between the sales and installation arms, and an
automated voice-response unit to handle all customer calls, directing
them to the relevant departments.  It plans to introduce tele-marketing
software which will be integrated with the ICMS system.

UK GOLD COMES OFF VIDEOTRON SYSTEMS

UK Gold, the Astra satellite entertainment channel, has refused
Videotron the right to distribute it on its cable networks in a bitter
row over carriage terms.

The channel, which carries archive BBC and Thames programmes, will come
off on February 12, losing 89,000 subscribers, two per cent of its
total satellite and cable subscription.

UK Gold, the most popular new-media channel among adults outside the
BSkyB stable, has told Videotron that it should be carried on
Videotron's lowest tier of channels, ensuring that it is seen by
virtually all subscribers.

Videotron, which owns networks in West and North London and in
Southampton, refuses to move it from a higher tier, where there are
fewer subscribers and therefore less revenue for UK Gold.

The row results from Videotron's policy of putting so-called ``basic''
channels into different tiers rather than a single ``big-basic''
package, which is the industry norm.

UK Gold said this week that is was prepared to compromise on its
principle that it should be received
by at least 95 per cent of an operator's customers and would accept
being put in a more restricted tier -- but only if Videotron were to pay
a higher per-subscriber fee to compensate it for a smaller reach.

It said that Videotron, whose packaging approach has upset several
programmers, is being inflexible.  It sent a solicitor's letter to the
cable company on Monday.

UK Gold used to be carried on a more restricted tier under the terms of
a contract which expired in November 1994.  Talks for a new contract
have dragged on ever since, with the channel being carried on a ``good
faith'' basis.  UK Gold said that Videotron had been paying it much
less than the 29p per subscriber per month it typically charges other
operators.

The channel said that Videotron only recently moved it from the highest
tier to the middle (standard) tier, despite a legal obligation to do so
before the expiry date of the last contract.

UK Gold is also angry that Videotron has been selling the channel on an
o-la-carte basis to people in the bottom tier -- illegally, in UK Gold's
view -- charging subscribers #1 but handing over only a few pence to the
channel.

Videotron, which is the fourth biggest cable operator in the UK, said
that UK Gold is asking it to pay 10p more than other operators pay --
that is, 39p.  UK Gold, however, said that it had put forward a range
of options with different prices, most of which were below 39p.

Videotron said that the price was unfair and suggested that the channel
was being punitive because of its refusal to carry UK Gold's sister
channel, the women's channel UK Living.  UK Gold denied the linkage.

Benjamin Ball, Videotron's director of programming (who, ironically,
helped to create UK Gold), said: ``We object to the idea that UK Gold
is trying to restrict our ability to offer our customers flexibility.
We want to carry the channel, but we are not prepared to sacrifice long-
term consumer benefits for short-term benefits to UK Gold.''

Videotron now runs three tiers: in ascending order, Option One,
Standard Pack and Super Pack.  The Standard Pack also carries the
channels of Option One, and the Super Pack also carries the channels of
both lower packs.

UK Gold wants to be carried in Option One, which contains only two
satellite channels, Sky One and Sky News, the only channels to be
watched by all Videotron subscribers.  At present, it is carried in the
Standard Pack and the Super Pack which, together, reach about 85 per
cent of subscribers.  The channel's coverage increases to 87 per cent --
89,000 subscribers -- because of Option One viewers who take it o la
carte.

Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, said: ``I feel bummed out
about disappointing the viewers, but someone's got to draw the line
somewhere.

``We are offering Videotron more flexibility.  We are even prepared to
allow the company to sell the channel o la carte, which means we have
to go back to other operators to give them the same flexibility.  But
our bottom line is that Videotron must pay a premium for the
flexibility.

``We hope that Videotron will reconsider its position.''

He said that the channel had little time for Videotron's controversial
packaging, which was designed to maximise consumer choice of
programming.  ``I would feel comfortable about the packaging if
Videotron`s penetration was double the industry's.  But I don't see any
evidence that this idea has improved penetration.''

Videotron's penetration on October 1 was 21.7 per cent, against an
industry average of 20.8 per cent.

Videotron argues that its three-tier approach has boosted penetration
and helped to cut churn to one of the lowest levels in the country, an
annualised 27.8 per cent (NMM 13:43).  Benjamin Ball, Videotron's head
of programming, said: ``Our strategy has been in place for more than
two years and has proved very successful.''

Steinberg said that he is concerned that the packaging of channels is
becoming the ``latest panacea'' to cure the UK cable industry's poor
cable-television penetration.  Like other programmers, he suggested
that what is needed is for operators to improve customer service and
marketing.

UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TV DIRECTIVE

The UK's Department of National Heritage reacted angrily to several
amendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directive
which were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culture
committee.

The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which would
give jurisdiction over a broadcaster to the countries receiving the
channels instead of to the country in which the broadcaster is
established.

The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principle
of the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcasts
which are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.

The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts to
tighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have at
least 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said that
amendments passed by the committee went against a ``political
agreement'' between the member states to stick with the existing
wording.

However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible for
the wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, will
get a further chance to quash the changes.

The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw out
the controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively on
the basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other states
have used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement.
 They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.

Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainment
programming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.

However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several other
controversial amendments, including one which would have banned
advertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and another
which would have required a health warning before advertisements for
alcoholic drinks on television.

The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament on
February 12.  But the committee has still not finished going through
the 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be considered
at a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51
amendments.

The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments before
sending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  The
council will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' on
the amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval by
the parliament.

The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has been
the one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After many
arguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should be
scrapped completely, and France, which believes they should be
tightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of last
year, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).

The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendment
under which certain light-entertainment programmes would not count
towards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would not
be eligble.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove
``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by these
shows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and films
to contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainment
channels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talk
shows.

A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soap
operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears of
some UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these would
still count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council and
the parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that there
would ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.

Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment which
switches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving the
broadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving country
jurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries with
jurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''

A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken for
granted that the parliament will accept what the committee has
proposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,
either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the council
of ministers.

The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope of
the directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-
demand.  It said that these services should properly be considered
separately under telecoms legislation.

TELEWEST CHIEF LEAVES

TeleWest's chief operating officer Danny Bryan has left the company
abruptly.  He is being replaced by former telecommunications head Lynn
Rexroth, who had been expected to return to shareholder US West to take
up a post in Japan.

Sources close to the company said that Bryan, who joined TeleWest from
shareholder TeleCommunications Inc a year ago, had found it hard to
adapt to the move from a well-established US cable operation to the
more start-up nature of the UK company.

GOLDEN STRANDS

UK Gold is creating three programme strands, which it describes as
``mini-channels'', as part of a plan to gear up for the launch of
digital satellite television.  The three strands may eventually be spun-
off to form separate digital channels operating under the UK Gold
umbrella.

From the middle of next month, the channel will have a two-hour
upmarket drama slot on Sunday nights, ``Masterpiece'', which will show
such series as I Claudius and Elizabeth R.

Earlier on Sunday nights, there will be a ``Showcase'' slot featuring
variety programmes such as Morcambe and Wise.  On Saturday nights, the
channel will run a drama slot, ``Spotlight'', covering themes such as
war, cops, spies and private eyes.

Further sub-brands will be based on situation comedy, science fiction,
action drama and alternative comedy.

LICENCE FEE TO SUPPORT NEW ARD, ZDF CHANNELS

German public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF will launch two new
cable and satellite channels in the next two years, one aimed at
children and the other a parliamentary channel.

The new channels will be funded from an increase in the licence fee of
DM4.45 a month (#2) which was proposed last week by the Kommission zur
Ermittlung des Finanzbedarss der Rundfunkanstalten (KEF), a commission
set up by the state governments to advise on the funding of ARD and
ZDF.

The commission is understood to have recommended that, out of the
DM4.45 increase, 15 pfennigs should be set aside to fund the children's
channel, and 7 pfennigs for the parliamentary channel.

The increase has still to be approved by the 16 state parliaments which
tend to rubber-stamp KEF proposals.

The news is a blow to Nickelodeon Germany, the children's channel
recently launched by US programmer Viacom and German toy manufacturer
Ravensburger.  Nickelodeon is Germany's only children's channel, and
has had considerable success in gaining cable carriage, despite a
continuing capacity crisis (NMM 13:42).

The launch of the new public-service children's channel, probably
during 1997, will offer stiff competition for viewers.  But it is also
likely to lead to serious cuts in Nickelodeon's cable distribution.
Distribution was granted by most media authorities only on a temporary
basis, in anticipation of the possible launch of an ARD/ZDF channel.

The idea of a public-service children's channel has long been mooted as
a means for ARD and ZDF to exploit their extensive libraries of
children's programming and to develop new programmes.  ZDF proposed
launching a children's channel in 1993, although at that time it was
being talked of as a pay service (Satellite TV Finance 4:19).  ARD
regional channel Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) also looked at launching
a children's channel (NMM 12:21).

The plans foundered because the two broadcasters are legally prevented
from launching advertising-supported channels.  Under the present plan,
the channel would be funded entirely from licence-fee revenues.

The idea of a parliamentary channel was put forward by WDR last year.  A
senior ZDF executive said this week that he was surprised that the idea
has received the support of the KEF, ``because we didn't really want
it.''  He said that ZDF had gone along with the proposal primarily
because it could be used to strengthen the argument for a licence-fee
increase:  ``Every politician is eager to see himself on TV'' (NMM
13:35).

According to the ZDF executive, the parliamentary channel could be
ready for launch late this year, with the children's channel following
early in 1997.

ARD and ZDF are desperate for an increase in the licence fee, because
the success of private commercial channels such as RTL TV, Sat 1 and
Pro 7 in recent years has led to heavy dents in the public-service
broadcasters' advertising revenues.  The viewing share of ARD's main
(national) network fell from 31 per cent in 1990 to 14.6 per cent for
1995, and ZDF's share fell from 29 per cent to 14.7 per cent.

The proposed licence-fee increase is in line with the amount requested
by the two broadcasters, but is being described as ``good news for ZDF
and bad news for ARD'', although ARD would get the larger share: DM2.35
against ZDF's DM2.05 (with another 5 pfennigs going to the media
authorities to fund their work).

ARD argues that it should have a much larger share of the increase
because, whereas ZDF is just one station, ARD has to support its
network of so-called ``third'' channels (regional television stations)
and also 11 radio stations, employing a total staff of 23,000.  This is
recognised in the way that the existing licence fee of DM23.80 per
month is split 70:30 in favour of ARD.

A senior ARD executive said this week that, if the KEF's recommendation
is ratified by the state parliaments in March, the broadcaster could
decide to take legal action against it.

The media authorities are also dissatisfied with the KEF proposal to
increase their funding.  The 5 pfennigs rise represents 1.12 per cent
of the overall increase, against the 2-per-cent share which the media
authorities take of the existing licence fee.

Any dispute over the apportioning of the increase is likely to lead to
delays in the launch of the two channels.

Further delays could result if, as seems likely, Nickelodeon takes
legal action against attempts to eject it from cable networks in favour
of the new public-service children's channel.

In several states, the channel is carried during daytime hours in the
cable slot used by the Franco-German public-service cultural channel
Arte, which broadcasts only in the evenings.  However, these states
have granted Nickelodeon cable carriage only until the end of the year,
in anticipation of the possibility that ARD and ZDF would want cable
carriage for their own children's channel.

Because the ARD/ZDF channel will be a public-service one, it will
automatically qualify for ``must-carry'' status in all German states.
Even in North Rhine Westphalia, the state which granted Nickelodeon's
licence, precedence will be given to the ARD/ZDF channel.

RTL-TV DRAWS UP PLANS FOR GERMAN NEWS CHANNEL

RTL TV, the top-rating German general entertainment channel owned by
Bertelsmann and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, is
considering launching a 24-hour German news channel.

The channel could launch in 1997 and would be broadcast in analogue
form via cable and satellite and would later move to digital.  RTL has
just launched a feasibility study on the planned channel.

RTL has also approached international broadcasters, including the US
network ABC, about providing foreign news coverage.  It is talking to
interactive software suppliers, such as Microsoft Corporation, about
the possibility of the new channel incorporating interactivity and
``news-on-demand'' facilities.

Hans Mahr, RTL director of information and sports, who is in charge of
the project, said that the main reason for launching a news channel is
that RTL correspondents are gathering far more news than can be used on
a general entertainment channel.  He estimated that the channel is able
to broadcast only one tenth of the news it produces.

Mahr said that the channel ``must be basically a German channel.''  Pan-
European channels such as Euronews ``would never succeed'' because news
is viewed ``from the perspective of where you live.''  Although the
channel is to be German-oriented, it would need foreign partners, such
as ABC, to give it an ``international context''.

Several German media regulators and television executives this week
questioned whether there is a market in Germany for another news
channel.  One regulator pointed out that national news channel n-tv is
``still struggling, despite the support of big players'' -- its US
shareholders Time Warner and CNN.  In 1995, n-tv's audience share was
0.3 per cent.

In addition to n-tv, Germany already has another national news and
information channel in Vox, the ``infotainment'' channel owned by News
Corporation, Bertelsmann and Canal Plus -- although the channel has
dropped a lot of its original news and information programming in a bid
to boost its ratings (NMM 13:30).

The RTL channel would also be competing with pan-European news channels
CNN, BBC World and Euronews; pan-European business channels NBC Super
Channel and European Business News; and the widely-respected news and
information coverage of public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF.  ARD's
8pm Tagesschau is still the most-watched news programme on German
television.

Mahr said that ARD's and ZDF's news coverage is ``all right for older
viewers who are used to that kind of presentation'', but that for
younger viewers a different style is needed.

Not all German commentators were against the idea of another news
channel.  One senior regulator said that the idea of the channel could
``make sense'' if viewers could receive the information when they
wanted it.  This would be ``a new form of bringing information to the
people.''

A former n-tv executive, who now works for a pan-European channel, said
that RTL would need only some new studios and perhaps 20 extra staff to
produce the channel for #20 million a year, which ``is not so much
money for RTL.''  He expected the new channel's approach to be typical
of RTL -- ``a little more bloodthirsty, a little more scandalous, a
little more mass market-oriented than n-tv.''

Most commentators agreed that that the channel would struggle if it
were supported by advertising alone.  However, several commentators
said that the channel would make sense if presented as part of a
digital subscription package, especially if it were the only news
channel in the market offering interactivity.

One senior ZDF executive said that if the channel is of a high
standard, and especially if it brings in good foreign news, ``then we
are in really deep trouble, because this is the last area where we
still lead.''

ARD AND ZDF LOSE SHARE AS PRO 7 SURGES FORWARD

German public-service channels ARD and ZDF continued to lose audience
share to their commercial rivals in 1995, with the two market-leading
channels RTL TV and Sat 1 maintaining their 1994 shares and the Kirch-
backed Pro 7 continuing its growth, particularly among children among
whom it is the most-viewed channel.

ARD and ZDF executives were this week comforting themselves that Sat 1
had not made bigger audience-share gains in the last two months of the
year, when Sat 1 introduced a raft of new big-budget programming.
However, one ZDF executive admitted that it is still ``far too early''
to judge the success of Sat 1's new schedules.

The executive warned against a too-literal reading of the figures,
which are skewed by the fact that they do not take into account the
distribution available to each channel nor the number of hours per day
in which a channel broadcasts.

The figures, from GfK, show that RTL-TV took a 17.6-per-cent share of
viewing in 1995, compared with 14.7 per cent for both Sat-1 and ZDF,
14.6 per cent for ARD and 9.9 per cent for Pro 7.

TERRESTRIAL BBC WORLD

BBC World, the corporation's 24-hour pan-European cable and satellite
news channel, last week began a four-week period of terrestrial
distribution to five million homes in the Berlin Brandenburg area of
Germany.

The channel is being distributed for a trial period on the frequency of
ORB, the ARD regional station for the area.  According to BBC World,
this is the first time a foreign channel has been given distribution by
an ARD station.

RTL TV ABANDONS BID TO STOP HOT BROADCASTING

Germany's leading private television channel RTL TV said this week that
it is unlikely to challenge a decision by the Bavarian constitutional
court to allow the controversial home-shopping channel HOT to transmit
to German satellite homes.

Two lower courts had upheld RTL's complaint that the channel breached
German broadcasting legislation.  But the higher court, the
Verfassungsgerichtshof, ruled just before Christmas that HOT could
continue to transmit on Astra 1d to the whole of Germany.

RTL could appeal to the German federal constitutional court but says
this is unlikely because legal action is likely to be overtaken by
changes which are expected to be made to German media law which would
liberalise tele-shopping.

When HOT (Home Order Television), owned by Thomas Kirch's Pro-7 and
mail order company Quelle, was granted a licence to broadcast by
satellite to the whole of Germany by the Bavarian media authority on
December 14, RTL appealed against the decision.  Bavaria had previously
given the channel a licence for distribution on two Bavarian cable
networks.

RTL claimed that Bavaria's media law did not give it the jurisdiction
to license home-shopping channels as tele-shopping did not count as
broadcasting.

Bavaria is to change its media legislation with a new clause expected
to take effect on March 1 that will allow the media authority to
license interactive media such as shopping channels that might fall
outside the strict definition of ``broadcasting''.

Under both the European Union's transfrontier directive and Germany's
Rundfunkstaatsvertrag, tele-shopping channels are theoretically allowed
on air for only one hour a day, but Bavaria's media authority -- like
the UK's Independent Television Commission (ITC) -- has interpreted the
rule more liberally than some other states (NMM 13:41).  The EU
directive is now being revised (see story on page 3) and is expected to
allow home shopping channels on air 24 hours a day.

RTL claims that its legal action was not in vain: ``We've had two
courts saying that HOT is in breach of German media law.  I think it
was important to show this.''

RTL's chief executive Helmut Thoma has said that his shareholders CLT
and Bertelsmann are interested in setting up a tele-shopping channel
themselves and that the Bavarian media authority is giving HOT an
unfair competitive advantage by allowing it to transmit nationally
before the law has been changed.

HOT has also just been granted a licence from the UK's ITC.  HOT said
that it had applied in late November in order to hedge its bets in case
it was not allowed to uplink from Bavaria.

FRENCH REPORT QUESTIONS EUTELSAT DIGITAL PLAN

A report on the future of digital satellite television in France has
questioned the feasibility of the digital package proposed by French
public broadcaster France Television and commercial station TF1.

The report, from national audit body the Cour des Comptes, said that
the partners lack the technological and commercial expertise to operate
a digital bouquet.  It recommends that they consider joining the rival
package of Canal Plus and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.

Georges Vanderchmitt, the former director general of France 2 who wrote
the report, also suggested that France Telecom should abandon plans to
launch its next television satellite, Telecom 2d, and change its role
to that of satellite service provider, selling on capacity leased on
Eutelsat and Astra satellites.

The report, published last week, signals an increasing commercial
awareness in French governmental thinking.  It acknowledges the
importance of the Astra satellite system and of international
commercial considerations.  In the past, French administrations had
discouraged channels from using Astra satellites.

French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon said that he
favoured a wide alliance of private and public companies to launch
digital satellite television and enable France to catch up with the UK
and Germany.

Vanderchmitt said that public-service broadcasters such as Arte and
France Television as well as TF1 should negotiate with Canal Plus and
CLT for access to their Astra digital packages rather than press ahead
with plans for rival offerings on Eutelsat's Hot Bird satellites.
Canal Plus and CLT are due to launch their digital bouquets by the end
of February.

TF1 and France Television set up a joint venture company late last year
to look into the possibility of a digital package on the Eutelsat
system.

Vanderchmitt urged France Telecom to follow Deutsche Telekom in
investing in Astra owner Societe Europeenne des Satellites.  But Fillon
said that a better option would be for private French companies to
invest in SES.

OPERATORS AND CHANNELS LAUNCH CABLE SURVEY

Cable-only programmers and the UK's top cable operators next week
launch an audience research project designed to give an accurate
picture of television viewing in cable homes.

The research is needed because the existing weekly cable and satellite
research from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb) does not
give viewing details for cable-only channels because its cable sample
is so small.

Although channels have taken Barb data and re-cast it to derive a
picture of cable-only viewing, they admit that the derived figures are
not reliable enough for firm conclusions to be drawn.

The programmers want hard data to help them sell advertising space.
The operators are also keen to have an accurate picture of cable-only
viewing as part of their armoury in carriage negotiations with
programmers.

The survey is being funded by the main cable operators, United Artists
Programming, the Independent Television Commission and the cable-only
channels Live TV, Channel One, SelecTV and Travel.

The fruits of the two-week survey should appear in March.  The backers
expect it to confirm the picture shown by their analysis of Barb data,
and by a recently published survey of cable viewing from the
Independent Television Commission, that viewers in cable homes watch
more new-media television than viewers in satellite dish homes.

The new research is designed to be as close to Barb methodology as
possible, even though it will be diary-based rather than use ``people
meters'' like Barb.  Diary research is generally thought to
underestimate viewing to small channels, because respondents forget
that they have spent time watching them.  The research is being carried
out by Barb contractor RSMB.

The ITC survey, carried out over two weeks in October by Continental
Research, showed that the share of viewing taken by cable and satellite
channels in cable homes was 39.6 per cent.  This compares with a Barb
figure of 34.6 per cent for the same two weeks, according to an
analysis by New Media Markets.  The Barb figure covers cable and
satellite homes, but mainly satellite homes.

David Brennan, research director at United Artists Programming, said
that his own analysis of RSMB's Barb research showed three key
differences between viewing in cable homes and viewing in dish homes.

First, cable viewers watch more television than their satellite
counterparts.

Second, they spend a greater proportion of their time watching non-
terrestrial channels.

Third, more than half of children's viewing is of non-terrestrial
channels.

Brennan cautioned that such conclusions are based on a very small
sample.  Although Barb's cable and satellite sample is designed to be
demographically representative and reflects Barb's establishment
survey, the sub-sections of cable and satellite viewers are not in
themselves representative of the cable and satellite universes.

So, according to Brennan, when adjustments are made to the cable sample
to ensure that it is representative, its size is reduced from 180 to
90.  With such a small sample, there is a greater likelihood of
distortion, particularly with viewing for small channels and among
demographic sub-groups, such as children.

He said that the suggestion that cable viewers view differently from
satellite viewers needs to be supported by hard evidence, initially
through the new survey but eventually through Barb, when its cable
sample is increased as cable subscription in the UK grows.

``By the end of this year, the cable element in Barb should be about
300 homes which should be enough to allow us to look at it
separately,'' said Brennan.

He offered three main reasons why cable viewers might watch more non-
terrestrial channels than satellite viewers.

First, there are more channels to choose from.  Second, there is a much
greater penetration of second set-top boxes in cable homes than of
second satellite receivers in dish homes.  Third, cable viewers are
able to move from terrestrial to non-terrestrial viewing using the same
remote-control handset, whereas satellite dish users generally need to
use two separate handsets.

The ITC survey, carried out by Continental Research, showed that the
viewing share taken by cable and satellite channels in cable homes was
39.6 per cent.  Earlier surveys gave a viewing figure of 34.9 per cent
for 1994 and 42.1 per cent in 1993.  Last year, the ITC suggested that
the sharp fall in cable viewing might have reflected the fact that
newer cable homes were less interested in cable television because they
had taken a cable service primarily for telephony.

The ITC, which is carrying out a review of the annual cable viewing
surveys which it (and its predecessor the Cable Authority) have
commissioned since 1990, admits that it has found some of the research
implausible.  This year's survey suggested that the upmarket European
Business News channel was more popular in lower-class homes than in the
channel's target AB demographic group.  The ITC found this as hard to
believe as an earlier survey's suggestion of heavy viewing of the Adult
Channel among children.

Jon Davey, ITC director of cable and satellite, said:

"One of the problems has always been the relatively small size of the
sample and therefore there are difficulties in drawing too many
conclusions".  Although the survey involved 1,306 one-week diaries from
653 respondents, the number who watched individual channels was
sometimes in single figures.  The new cable research will involve a
sample of about 1,200 viewers.

The survey showed that Sky One has been overtaken by BSkyB premium film
channels as the most popular non-terrestrial channel in cable homes:
its share fell from 6.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent, while the Movie
Channel took top place with 5.8 per cent (up from 4.9 per cent) and Sky
Movies second place with 5.2 per cent (down from 5.4 per cent).

The NMM analysis of the dish-oriented Barb data for the same two weeks
in October shows several differences among channels.  UK Gold,
Nickelodoen, TCC, Discovery, Eurosport and MTV all did better in cable
homes.  Sky News did far worse.

Comparisons are difficult, partly because the ITC cable figures are for
all individuals aged two and above, whereas the Barb lower limit is
four years old.  Further, the ITC cable figures reflect each channel's
own universe of homes rather than all cable homes.  Barb covers all
cable and satellite homes.  For this reason, the NNM comparison covers
only those channels whose cable universe is close to (has at least 95
per cent of) the total cable universe.

Children's viewing of new-media channels in cable homes accounts for
well over half their total television viewing (54.4 per cent, compared
with 47.3 per cent in 1994).  Among younger children (2-9 year-olds),
the trend is more pronounced, with cable and satellite channels
accounting for 63.9 per cent of viewing.

The survey also showed that the penetration of second set-top boxes has
increased from 28.4 per cent of cable homes in 1994 to 34.8 per cent in
1995. The Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and the Cartoon Network
gained greater audience share among homes with multiple set-top boxes.

NETHOLD MAY NOT FIND PAY-SPORTS WILL EASILY BEAT A FREE CHANNEL

Can a free sports channel compete successfully against a premium sports
channel?  The UK experience suggests the battle would be one-sided,.
with the premium channel bringing in enough subscription revenue to make
it worth its while paying high prices for sports rights.

Scandinavia may well show that television life can be different that
Kinnevik's planned free sports channel, Sportkanalan, can beat
NetHold's recently-launched premium channel, Supersport.

There are many similarities between the two channels.  First, they are
not stand-alone channels, but intrinsic to the direct-to-home satellite
packages which the rival programmers are trying to push in the Nordic
market.

Second, each operator plans to run customised feeds to deliver opt-out
programming to the different language markets of the region.  Although
winter sports are popular in all Nordic countries, there are
differences of taste among the four countries.

Third, the channels look set to roll out very similar schedules: a
mixture of top sports and "wallpaper" sports.  Both have deep pockets
and are prepared to fork out the necessary cash for top sports events.

As the New Year gets under way, it does not appear that the premium
Supersport has significantly more top events than the free
Sportkanalan.  So it is hard to see how it will be able to establish
ascendancy quickly, at least not in the devastating way in which
British Sky Broadcasting's Sky Sports so easily pushed the established
Screensport into its terminal plight.

Supersport launched in Scandinavia last month using the Intelsat 601
satellite to reach cable head-ends.  Although it launched in analogue,
it will also become a key part of NetHold's planned digital satellite
package due to be launched on the Astra 1e satellite in the next few
months.  Sportkanalan is due to launch in March on the Scandinavian
Sirius satellite.

Most observers believe that the free Sportkanalan will be the likely
winner.  Few believe that there is room for two dedicated sports
channels in the Nordic market.  Some suggest that there may be room for
neither, given the presence of Eurosport Nordic, the regionalised
version of the pan-European Eurosport channel, which has the rights to
several top events, particularly in winter sports.

Peter Legaard, Nordic media director for Ogilvy and Mather, is
convinced that Sportkanalan stands the better chance in the region.  He
thinks that both channels have a good mix of programming and
advertisers will be pleased that they will appeal to young male
viewers.

But he believes that Sportkanalan will do better simply because it will
be free.  With more and more pay channels being offered, "there is a
limit to how much people will pay for television.  The time people
spend watching television will stay the same."

Scandinavian Broadcasting System's managing director Jan Steinmann
believes that Scandinavia is too small a market to handle and
advertising-supported sports channel.  He points to escalating rights
fees in the region and wonders if enough advertising revenue could ever
be raised to make a profit.  He claims that it is these high fees that
has convinced him to drop sports events on the cable and satellite
channel, Femmen.  It will now bill itself as the region's "sports - and
news-free" alternative.

Public-service broadcaster SVT and the Eurosport satellite channel are
also, not surprisingly, sceptical.

Bo Gentzel, SVT head of sport who turned down the job of managing
director at both new channels, does not believe that Scandinavia needs
more sports channels?  "We are not as television-mad as Americans.  I
don't think the audience for both channels will be very high.  Sweden
is half the size of London in terms of population.  So, we don't think
the channels will be a threat, but they will be good for the sports
idiot."

Eurosport also believes that Scandinavia is too small a television
market for three sports channels.  As a result, says Vincent Chupin,
the channel's head of sports acquisition, there may well not be enough
advertising to justify a free sports channel.

Both Supersport and Sportkanalan have had to agree shared deals with
established terrestrial channels, perhaps sub-licensing events from
them.  This is because so many rights in the region are already tied
up, and this will be the case until the end of decade when many come up
for renegotiation.

It is here that some observers believe Sportkanalan will have the
advantage, as Kinnevik already has a cosy relationship with terrestrial
broadcasters, especially SVT.  They argue that Kinnevik, as a powerful
regional programmer, is more knowledgable of the region's tastes.

Sportkanalan: Once bitten, twice shy, seems to be the guiding principle
behind Kinnevik's decision to create a free sports channel rather than
a pay-channel.

Kinnevik shut down the Filmmax pay-movie channel last autumn because it
could not get enough subscribers.  Subscriptions for its TV1000 film
and entertainment channel have not been good and the channel lost
SKr110 million (#10.7 million) in the first half of 1995.  There have
even been reports of talks between Kinnevik and arch-rival NetHold
about merging TV1000 into NetHold's FilmNet channels.

Kinnevik is not interested in getting its fingers burned again on a pay
channel.  It believes that its free sports channel can outgun NetHold's
pay-channel for three reasons:

* Sports fans in the region are used to watching sport on television
for free

* A free channel will attract more viewers than Supersport and this, in
turn, should enable it to attract more premium events looking for
``eyeballs''

* It will be easier to convince cable networks to take the channel -- an
important consideration in Norway where cable subscribers vote to
decide which channels are offered.

Sportkanalan will need to convince advertisers that a tiny viewing
share is worthwhile.  Managing director Lasse Haglund believes that the
channel can live with a 1-per-cent viewing share.

Veteran sports rights negotiators believe that a low viewing share
could scare off the owners of some events.  According to SVT's Gentzel,
``if you have only a 2-per-cent market share, there will be problems
with the sponsors of sporting events.  There's no point in doing a
channel unless you can get a 5-per-cent share.  SVT's normal share for
sports events is 15 per cent.''

Supersport: NetHold's Supersport is intended to be a must-have for
sports fans, whom the programmer hopes will flock to pay for digital
decoders -- at a cost of SKr6,000 each -- and pay the monthly
subscription fee.

At present, the analogue Supersport costs SKr179 a month if bought as a
stand-alone service or or SKr259 if bought as part of a package with
FilmNet1 and FilmNet 2 (the recently re-named FilmNet Plus and Complete
Movie Channel).

NetHold sees the premium sports channel as a key element in helping to
drive the penetration of its digital package.

With Supersport's raison d'etre dependent on its having more premium
events than Sportkanalan, access to rights is even more crucial.
Supersport's acting deputy head Ian Woodrow said that the channel's
survival will be linked to the number of live events it can show
exclusively.

He said: ``People are used to having sports for free, so we must have
the key sports.  We can't charge premium prices for incidental
sports.''

During the week, Supersport will broadcast six hours of programming in
the evening, expanding to 12 hours a day on weekends. It will have
separate feeds for each of the region's languages, with 70 per cent of
the programming the same for each country.

NetHold intends to run Supersport in parallel with its planned pay-per-
view channels to:

* Maximise revenue of an event by switching, for example, a final match
from Supersport to ppv;

* Increase interest in Supersport by using ppv sports events as a
teaser for the main channel.

Jan Friedman, vice-president of NetHold Nordic, admitted that the
strategy would take a degree of finesse to pull off: ``We don't want to
make loyal Supersport subscribers disappointed.''

Supersport's search for premium events has proven to be less-than-
ideal.  Some critics argue that the line-up (see box) is not worth the
subscription fee.

They point out that the channel does not have exclusive rights for
Swedish ice-hockey and that TV4, from which the rights are sub-
licensed, has a better deal.  Further, Supersport will show only the
Sunday and Monday matches of the English Premier League: rights for the
popular Saturday matches are held by terrestrial broadcasters.

Cable carriage will be another deciding factor.  NetHold is trying to
persuade the main cable operators in the region to sell it capacity to
carry four named channels, but with the freedom to use the capacity for
its full-blown digital service.  So far, none of the major operators
has signed the deal.

It is much easier for Sportkanalan to convince cable networks to take
one channel, rather than the minimum of four being offered by NetHold.

But NetHold's Friedman believes that the company is being generous with
its offer. ``Unless cable operators do a deal with us now, they will
get so many calls from customers wanting to watch Supersport.  In the
first couple of years we do need a parallel cable distribution because
the losses will be very, very high.''

Sportkanalan will broadcast 80 hours of programming a week, and
according to Sternmarker, has already acquired 2,000 hours of
programming.  This includes 500 hours of live golf and 100 hours of
sports documentaries produced by TWI.

Eurosport: The established player in the market, Eurosport Nordic, is
available to the DTH market on the Thor satellite and free on most
cable networks.

Eurosport's Vincent Chupin thinks that the channel can compete with
both new channels when it comes to rights and programming because it is
part of a pan-European network offering advertisers a large audience.

Eurosport, Chupin says, being part-owned by European Broadcasting Union
broadcasters, will be able to draw on a wide variety of sporting events
from across Europe to attract viewers.

Critics, however, argue that the same EBU broadcasters will be tempted
to sell some of the choicest programming to the new sports channels
purely because the money will be better.

They say all these public broadcasters share the same problems: too
much programming and too few slots in the schedule to show it; and
pressure from tight budgets to increase revenues where possible.  Under
these conditions, loyalty to the EBU and Eurosport could take a back
seat to lucrative sub-licensing deals.

Chupin thinks Supersport would do well in Sweden if it showed games
from the Swedish football league.  SVT has the rights for this year and
an option to renew them until 1998.

The key events which neither of the new sports channels have are this
year's Atlanta Olympics and European football championships, which are
both held by SVT and Eurosport.

As for Sportkanalan, Chupin thinks it will at best match Eurosport's
two to three per cent viewing share, something ``I'm not sure if you
can survive merely in Scandinavia.''

ENDEMOL MAY QUIT HMG AS BRUSSELS TURNS UP HEAT

Endemol Entertainment is considering selling its entire stake in the
Holland Media Group in order to safeguard its lucrative programming
contracts with the group's three television channels.

Endemol, the Netherlands largest independent production company, was
told last October by the European Commission that it had to reduce its
stake in the group from 23 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

But last month, the commission went further and said, in informal talks
with HMG, that Endemol should reduce the amount of programming it makes
for HMG's three television channels by at least 10 per cent.  Endemol
was also told that it would not be allowed a seat on the shareholders'
committee, which oversees the board of directors.

Endemol supplies 20 per cent of the output of RTL 4, RTL 5 and
Veronica.  It is likely to sell its HMG stake to one or more of its
partners in the consortium: broadcaster RTL 4, Dutch publishers VNU and
Veronica.

Last October, the commission's competition directorate (DG IV) said
that HMG was anti-competitive as it stood.  To satisfy Brussels, HMG
partner RTL 4 is selling 66 per cent of its satellite channel RTL 5.

ADULT CHANNEL SEEKS GERMAN RESPECTABILITY

The Adult Channel, already available to direct-to-home satellite
viewers in Germany, has applied to German media regulators for approval
to go on German cable networks.

The encrypted channel, which is licensed for satellite transmission in
Europe by the UK's Independent Television Commission, has asked for a
certificate of ``confirmation of non-objection'' from the DLM, the
umbrella body of the country's 15 media regulators.

This means that the DLM must monitor the channel's programming to see
whether it can be deemed to be pornography.  If the regulators decide
that it is pornographic, the channel can be refused permission to go on
cable under German media law.

Regulators say this is the first time they have had such a request.
There are no ``adult'' channels on German cable networks at present.

When the German pay-channel Premiere introduced an adult segment two
years ago, the DLM commissioned an expert from the University of
Hamburg to judge whether the programming was pornographic.

He judged it on sociological grounds, deciding that it was pornographic
because it had no plot and women had no role or character other than to
satisfy men, the typical role of women in pornography.  As a result,
the programming was withdrawn.

The DLM should come to a decision on the Adult Channel within six
months and may well commission an expert in a similar way.

LIVE TV HOPES FOR BOOST FROM DARTS, SOAP AND ADS

Live TV, the Mirror Group's cable channel, admitted this week that its
controversial screening of ``topless darts'', which started on Monday,
had been criticised by professional women's darts players.

The darts contests, filmed on Australian beaches, run for two minutes
each night at 11pm.  Live TV denied that the contestants -- women of a
certain age and shape -- had been chosen on the basis of their looks
rather than their ability to project darts at a board.  The programming
was neither sexist nor exploitative, said Live TV, but ``good clean
fun.''

The darts programmes will be followed next Monday by the debut of the
channel's soap opera, Canary Wharf, which is equally sexual in content,
featuring bed-hopping among television executives of a range of sexual
orientations.  Publicity for the programme promises that ``you're never
more than five minutes from a snog.''

The new programming is being backed by a #1 million radio and poster
advertising campaign which the channel claims is the biggest by a UK
cable-only channel.  The campaign uses the slogan ``Look on the bright
side'' -- something which the Mirror Group hopes to do if the new
programming boosts the poor ratings of the channel in which it is
investing #30 million.

PERFORMANCE TO EXPAND

Performance, the cable arts channel owned by Associated Newspapers, is
to move to satellite distribution in March via the Orion 1 satellite.

The channel, at present tape-delivered, will increase its transmission
hours and will seek to gain an audience on cable networks in
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries.

It will also introduce strip-scheduling, broadcasting jazz programming
at the same time each day during weekdays and opera at weekends.
Audience feedback for the channel, which is aimed at an upmarket
audience, suggested that jazz and opera were its most popular
offerings.

BRUNO AND MAN UTD TOP YEAR'S NEW-MEDIA CHARTS

Cable and satellite's most popular programme of 1995 -- and most popular
ever -- was Frank Bruno's successful challenge for the WBC World
Heavyweight Championship against Oliver McCall in September.

The programme attracted 2,248,000 viewers, giving it a TVR (percentage
of those people who could watch it) of 17.3 and a viewing share of 42.7
per cent in Astra dish and cable homes.

The charts have been compiled by New Media Markets as part of an
analysis of viewing data from Barb (Broadcasters Audience Research
Board).

The second most popular programme was one of last season's key Premier
League matches -- Manchester United v Blackburn Rovers, with 2,036,000
viewers (TVR 16.8 and viewing share 41.7 per cent).

Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic, came in at Number 3,
attracting 2,007,000 viewers for the Movie Channel.

The film was the only programme to break Sky Sports monopoly of the Top
10.  Only one other non-sports programme -- the film, Demolition Man, in
14th place -- made the Top 20.  Sports programmes took 26 of the Top 30
Astra programmes and 35 of the Top 50 programmes, with the premium film
channels and Sky One performing respectably in the 40s.

If Frank Bruno was new-media's biggest one-night stand, Manchester
United was its most consistent star.  Five top soccer matches took the
fourth-to-eighth positions, with Manchester United playing in all but
one of the games, as well as taking the No.2 spot.

The third most popular film of the year, after Jurassic Park and
Demolition Man, was The Fugitive, followed by Mrs Doubtfire and Jungle
Book.  Jungle Book, which launched the Disney Channel on October 1, was
the most popular non-BSkyB Astra programme, with 1,303,000 viewers.  It
was the only non-BSkyB programme to get more than a million viewers and
the only one to make the overall Astra Top 50 chart.

Disney also took the second and third places of the non-BSkyB chart,
both with screenings of the film, Cool Runnings.  But the chart was
dominated by the Cartoon Network, with 32 of the Top 50 programmes.

Sky One was the most popular channel over the year as a whole, with a
viewing share of 5 per cent, according to the New Media Markets
analysis.  The share was hit by a poor winter (only 4 per cent in
December).  Sky One's 1994 share was 5.4 per cent.

Sky Sports achieved 3.8 per cent for the year, 0.3 points up on 1994.
It had a good December, with 5 per cent, and a very good Christmas week
at 7.1 per cent, equalling its second-best weekly share.

MURDOCH CONSORTIUM BIDS #1.2BN FOR EUROPEAN TV RIGHTS TO OLYMPICS

A consortium backed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the leading
shareholder in British Sky Broadcasting, submitted a bid worth more
than $2 billion (#1.2 billion) for the European broadcasting rights for
the winter and summer Olympics between 2000 and 2008.  Olympic rights
have normally gone to the European Broadcasting Union, which negotiates
collectively on behalf of Europe's public-service broadcasters.

The consortium, which is thought to include other continental
broadcasters, would show the Olympics on terrestrial and subscription
networks.

MAJOR CONSIDERS BSKYB SPORTS BAN

UK Prime Minister John Major said that the government is considering
the imposition of restrictions on British Sky Broadcasting's right to
buy television sports rights.  National Heritage secretary Virginia
Bottomley said before Christmas that any restriction was ``out of the
question''.  The Office of Fair Trading is already investigating
BSkyB's purchase of exclusive sports rights.

BBC PROTESTS AFTER ARABIC BLACK-OUT

The BBC's Arabic television service was repeatedly blacked out during
its coverage of the UK government's decision last week to deport
Mohammed al-Mas'ari, the Saudi dissident.  The service is shown as part
of an Orbit Communications package of channels distributed from Orbit's
relay station in Rome, where the black-out occurred.  Orbit is owned by
a cousin of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Prince Khalid bin 'Abd al-
Rahman.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government failed in its bid to get Channel 4 to
drop its Tuesday night transmission of a documentary about Chinese
orphanage ``dying rooms''.

Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.  Group Bruxelles Lambert, which owns
nearly 60 per cent of CLT, wants to sell and has talked to a number of
companies.  British Sky Broadcasting is thought to be a potential
bidder, in league with Germany's Kirch Group.

FOOD GROUP TAKES A BITE OF PRO-7

Rewe, Germany's biggest food retailer, acquired 40 per cent of the
Kirch-backed Pro 7 general entertainment cable channel.

Rewe is believed to have paid DM120 million (#53.8 million) for the
stake, a sum described by one German media regulator as ``ridiculously
low'', in view of the channel's net profit last year of about DM200
million.

Pro 7 is selling a further 35.5 per cent on the stock market, in an
attempt to deflect criticism of Thomas Kirch, who was thought by many
regulators to hold his stake of 47.5 per cent in the channel on behalf
of his father Leo Kirch, founder of the Kirch Group.

PEARSON CLOSE TO BUYING SELECTV

Pearson TV said that it has completed due diligence on the purchase of
SelecTV.  But Flextech refuses to rule itself out as a potential
purchaser.

Pearson's purchase is being delayed because it says it is not
interested in buying SelecTV's cable channel or its 15-per-cent stake
in ITV company Meridian which will have to be sold separately.

The prospective purchasers are thought to be ITV franchise holder
Carlton, for the cable channel, and MAI, for the Meridian stake (MAI is
Meridian's main shareholder).
