	When actress Jane Seymour won the prestigious Golden Globe award this year as best actress for her hugely popular television series about a frontier doctor, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, a little bit of the trophy’s glory shone on the field of alternative medicine. In this 60-minute series—viewed by 22 million people in 82 countries and now in its fourth successful season on CBS—the British actress plays a Boston-bred physician named Michaela Quinn who practices medicine in the wild west of Colorado Springs in the early 1870s.<p>
	It’s not that “Dr. Mike,” as she’s known among the townspeople, practices alternative medicine instead of conventional. In 1870s America, what we know today as “alternative” was far more conventional, even mainstream. Boston was the heart of homeopathy in America; herbalists known as Eclectics were flourishing throughout the land; physicians of all kinds worked openly in the medical marketplace, without FDA suppression.<p>
	In fact, Dr. Quinn is a fair-minded showpiece for how both kinds of medicine—alternative and conventional allopathic—can prosper in the world together. In a quaint but focused way, Dr. Quinn, with her ankle-length calico skirts and black medicine bag, is an inspiring image that would not be out of place today were she to walk off the set and into a consulting room.<p>
	Dr. Quinn is self-sufficient, open-minded, and compassionate. The doctor’s healing presence counts for something with her and she’s open to new empirical research, based on experience. Medicine is not a rigid orthodoxy, but fluid, changing, and growing. Today’s distressing world of impersonal HMOs, malpractice suits, side effects, toxic drugs, clinical indifference, and huge doctor’s fees is not yet even a rumor from the future in her world.<p>
	In one episode, everybody comes down with influenza. Dr. Mike dispenses quinine, exhausts her supply, and gets sick herself. The native American healers restore her to health with purple cone flowers, or Echinacea. “She’s a real doctor, all the way from Boston,” says a Lakota woman. “She knows the fancy medicine of the whites.” Yes, but those “white doctors” also knew about homeopathy and herbs. And Dr. Mike wants to learn the medicines of her Lakota Sioux neighbors. <p>
	It’s family entertainment, yet Jane Seymour’s “Dr. Mike” is also quietly, steadily political. Every week the show sends out the message that different medicines can coexist in the public health arena, that doctors can care, that women doctors may be able to care even more, and that all alternatives that work will be considered.<p>
	It is not whimsical to call Jane Seymour’s character an “alternative” medicine woman. Both on and off the set at the Paramount Ranch in the Santa Monica hills in California, Jane practices what Dr. Quinn embodies. While not a doctor herself, Jane Seymour grew up in England surrounded by medicine. Her mother, Mieke, was a Red Cross nurse, while her father, John Frankenberg, was an obstetrician. Dr. Frankenberg, a surgeon and Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, was strait-laced about what constitutes proper medicine until he came down with bone and lung cancer late in his life. <p>
	“He had always been against anything alternative and pooh-poohed the whole idea,” says Seymour. “He didn’t even take vitamins.” But Jane persuaded her father, whose cancer was inoperable, to try something daring. In 1990, when he was “gray, very frail, and skeletal,” she took him to the Livingston Foundation Medical Center in San Diego—an alternative cancer clinic based on the pioneering work of Virginia Livingston, M.D.—where he began intravenous vitamin C therapy.<p>
	Dr. Frankenberg “did extremely well” and was “like a different man.” When he eventually died, it was from heart complications, not cancer. “He actually said to me before he died that he wished he had known more about alternative medicine earlier in his life so he could have used it in conjunction with regular medicine,” says Jane. “He felt the combination of the two would have been ideal.”<p>
	Her father’s lesson was not lost on Jane, who is an alternative medicine proponent. On the set of Dr. Quinn, she administers homeopathic Arnica Montana to actors who bruise themselves; she keeps a supply of Oscillococcinum, the popular homeopathic flu remedy; she has vitamin C tablets and zinc lozenges nearby to keep up her vitality and stop colds; and she admits to having a well-thumbed copy of Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide close at hand for quick information on other health problems. <p>
	“I keep Burton Goldberg’s book handy. Our medic on the set has the book as well, so whenever anything goes wrong, people look up the problem in the Definitive Guide to see if there’s something else to try instead of the conventional approach.” Jane sees herself as a “steerer to doctors.” That’s because “quite often I actually steer people to the right kind of doctor.”<p>
	 It makes sense: she is a doctor’s daughter, after all. “I practically grew up in hospitals since I was 3,” says Jane. “I watched surgeries when I was 10. I worked as an auxiliary nurse, then a Red Cross nurse. Seymour recently did something quite unusual for a woman who is 44 years old: she gave birth to twins. Jane attributes this impressive feat to the following: avoiding antibiotics and conventional drugs whenever possible; regularly taking nutritional supplements; eating sensibly; keeping her energy and vitality in topnotch condition; maintaining an upbeat, confident attitude that is not afraid of illness; and receiving chiropractic, reflexology, massage, and acupressure treatments routinely. <p>
	During her pregnancy—she has birthed 2 other children—Jane had as many as four treatments a week of these alternative health care practices. Ever since she had a life-threatening reaction (called anaphylactic shock) to antibiotics in 1988, Jane has avoided them. “I barely take any medication, even Tylenol or aspirin. If I can knock the problem on the head with alternative therapies first, then that’s what I do. The antibiotic experience compounded and reinforced this feeling. I use some of the alternative therapies that I’m familiar with, and I’m open-minded to more.”<p>
	If she gets sick, she can always call on her younger sister Ann who is studying homeopathy back in England. Ann’s children had chronic allergies, eczema, and asthma for which conventional medicine had no answers, says Jane. “Then Ann found that through using homeopathy, she was able to help her children substantially. She believes in it so much it’s becoming her life’s work. Now she’s the family member who usually prescribes for us when we need a remedy.” <p>
	When Jane’s pregnancy required an emergency Cesarean section, she prepared herself with Arnica to reduce the bruising and to speed up her post surgical healing. When her other sister, Sally, developed a brain aneurysm (a blood vessel bulge that can rupture) and underwent a risky surgery, she took steady doses of Arnica. “The results were incredible with Sally when we gave her Arnica right after her surgery,” says Jane. “She had substantially less swelling than anyone else on the ward who had received the same surgery. In fact, it was so minimal that the doctors and nurses could not believe the difference.” <p>
	Her sister’s deep interest in homeopathy has inspired Jane with a greater trust in this specific approach and with alternative medicine generally. “I saw the good effects on friends of mine. A lot of my friends use homeopathy all the time, even exclusively. I am a great believer in preventive medicine. If we all learned how to keep ourselves healthy, then we wouldn’t have to go to doctors quite so much.” <p>
	So firm is her belief in the efficacy of alternative medicine, that Jane hosted a 6-hour Turner Broadcasting special called The Heart of Healing in 1993. This show dealt with progressive themes such as hypnosis for severe burn control, visualizations for tumor regression, and biofeedback for cerebral palsy. Bear in mind, this aired around the same time as Bill Moyer’s celebrated PBS documentary Healing and the Mind, so Jane should be ranked equally with Moyers as a prime early popularizer of alternative medicine.<p>
	Dr. Michaela Quinn is a composite character based on what a woman doctor with gumption would have been like in 1870s America, but the role might have been tailored to fit Jane Seymour the doctor’s daughter. When she first read the script for Dr. Quinn, Jane found it a remarkable coincidence. “I couldn’t believe they had written this character who in many ways resembled my own background. My father brought me up to believe I could do anything and that I should be very independent, just like Dr. Quinn.” <p>
	Dr. Quinn’s spirit of independence also extends to medicine. As Lear’s  magazine commented in a 1993 cover story on Jane Seymour, “Michaela Quinn often looks to Native American cures and acknowledges that there may be more to healing than what she learned in medical school.”<p>
	The point of the series is that Dr. Quinn is always open-minded to other theories and medicines. After all, a lot of medications prescribed today are pharmaceutical versions of medicines that once came from herbs. Even better, Dr. Quinn shows her 22 million viewers that the power of mind, positive attitude, compassion, and a doctor’s willingness—and ability—to listen to patients are paramount in the practice of true medicine.<p>
	“I think that’s the main quality in good medicine: being there and listening, really hearing what the person’s problems are,” Jane says. The experience of her sister Sally’s brain aneurysm convinced her of the power of the mind to console and heal when Jane stood in a circle of family and friends and sent Sally healing thoughts. <p>
	“Very few people survive that kind of aneurysm, but from the moment we were there in a circle, the doctor said Sally started taking a turn for the better. In fact, she came out completely recovered, as if nothing had ever happened to her. So I absolutely believe there is a power of healing that works through this kind of positive thinking.” That’s the kind of frontier open-mindedness to new approaches in medicine that makes Dr. Michaela Quinn, alternative medicine woman, a doctor worth emulating today.<br>
