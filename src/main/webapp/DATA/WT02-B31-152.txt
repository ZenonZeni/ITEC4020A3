<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>These Five Insurance and Financial Mistakes Can Cost You
Dearly</STRONG></FONT><P>




Everyone wants financial success for themselves and their families.  The dreams
that we spend long
hours working towards - whether it's a first home, a college education for the
children, or a retirement
home some place warm - these are all goals on the path to financial security. 
Unfortunately, it's all too
easy to stumble on the way to your destination.  I've compiled a list of what I've
found to be the most
common errors people make in their insurance and financial planning.  They're all
potentially costly,
and they could mean the difference between financial success and failure.
<P>
<OL>

<LI><STRONG>Failure to Plan</STRONG> - An old saying goes:  "Most people don't plan
to fail, they
fail
to plan."  This is
particularly true when it comes to insurance and finances.  If any planning is done
it's on a piecemeal
basis, but that's just not enough.  To have a shot at accomplishing what we want,
we must first set our
goals, analyze what it will take to achieve those goals, and then implement a plan. 
The plan should
include everything from savings and checking accounts, to longer term vehicles like
annuities, CDs, IRAs, and the protection provided by life, health, and disability income
insurance.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Insufficient Diversification</STRONG> - Another old adage still rings
true:  "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket." 
Diversification is generally considered a key to reducing risk and enhancing
potential return.  Some
people believe that because they have CDs in three different banks they're properly
diversified.  True
diversification cuts across product types, lengths of maturity, and asset
categories.  With a well
diversified portfolio, you're never too dependent on how well one product performs.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Insufficient Life Insurance</STRONG> - We're quick to insure our cars
and our homes,
but too often we overlook
our most important asset - ourselves.  With mortgages, tuitions, and bills to be
paid, it's important to
have proper coverage on all income earners.  Some people may have group term life
insurance through
their employers, but this alone may not be sufficient.  Be careful not to be overly
dependent on group
term, for these plans can be inflexible, may not be portable, and may not be
available when you need them
most - after age 65.  Look into purchasing individual coverage that can be
customized to suit your
particular needs.  How much life insurance is enough?  That depends on a number of
personal factors
including income and number of dependents.  It's best to sit down with a
professional to go over your
needs and look at the available options.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Inadequate Disability Income Insurance</STRONG> - Your earning power is
the
generator that keeps the
wheels of your household running smoothly.  But what if that generator breaks down? 
The risk of
disability, as well as its potential cost, is simply too great to ignore.  Once
again, a company-sponsored
plan may be too limited for your needs.  Typically, disability income insurance
plans will cover 50 - 60%
of your annual income for a pre-determined period of time.  You'll want to study
the policy carefully to
understand all of the provisions, including the definition of disability, the
waiting period following
disability before you can collect, and the length of the payment period.  
<P>
<LI><STRONG>No Estate Plan</STRONG> - Some people have the impression that estate
planning is
just for the rich. 
Unfortunately, that view can be costly 
to their heirs.  Your estate includes such items as your home, cash, investments,
personal property,
and other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property. 
These may add up to
a lot more than you thought you were worth.  Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for
estates valued at
more than $600,000 and can climb as high as 60% for larger estates.  Add in state
death taxes and
final expenses and your death can be quite costly to your loved ones.  You owe it
to your family to have
an estate plan in place.  An effective will, a trust arrangement, and adequate life
insurance are some of
the options available to you to help your heirs get what they deserve.  Consult
your tax, legal, and
financial advisors for help in putting together an estate plan.
<P>
</OL>
"To err is human" is yet another pearl of wisdom.  Sure, everyone makes mistakes,
but all of the ones
outlined above can be avoided.  With proper insurance and financial needs planning you
can steer past those
costly blunders and be on the road to financial success.
