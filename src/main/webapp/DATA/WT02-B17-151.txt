<h2>Federal Agencies Increasing the Use of "Green" Products</h2>

Each year, the Federal Government purchases between $10 and 20
billion in energy-consuming products.  As the world's largest
consumer, the Federal Government can help "pull" the
entire market towards greater energy efficiency.  A thoughtful
procurement policy targeting "green" technologies will
help save taxpayer dollars, energy, water, and other natural resources,
provide market leadership, and stimulate technology innovation.
 Both the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Executive Order 12902
address this issue and provide guidance to Federal agencies.
<P>
DOE's Federal Energy Management Program has developed recommendations
that will help Federal energy managers identify energy efficient
products for their purchase.  These product recommendations are
used by Federal supply agencies in designating energy efficient
products in their catalogs and on-line databases and in directing
vendors to designate such products in published or on-line schedules.
 The recommendations cover a broad range of technologies including
lighting, appliance, renewable energy, water saving, construction,
and transportation.  These recommendations will assist Federal
agencies in complying with Executive Order 12902, which requires
the purchase of "best-practice" energy efficient, renewable,
and water-conserving products whenever practicable.  These are
products that have been found to be in the upper 25 percent of
their category in terms of their energy and water efficiency.
<P>
Federal agencies can achieve significant operating cost reductions
through the purchase and installation of energy-efficient and
resource-conserving equipment; energy savings of 25 percent can
often be realized through the selection of "best-practice"
products.  Such products are typically the better choice when
selection is based on life-cycle cost, which takes into consideration
the operating cost of the product over its lifetime.  For example,
energy savings from a difference in purchase price of $229 between
a standard-efficiency 25 horsepower motor and a high-efficiency
model may be recovered in 18 months.  For some products, such
as fluorescent lamp ballasts, high volume buying has resulted
in little or no premium in the purchase price of higher efficiency
products.
<P>
As supply agencies to the Federal government, the General Services
Administration and Defense Logistics Agency are working with FEMP
to identify all "best practice" products that are available
from Federal supply services.  This identification system will
make it easy for procurement officials to locate such products,
both electronically and through catalogs and schedules.
