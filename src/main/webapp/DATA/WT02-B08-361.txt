<h1 align=center> AFPI Information  </h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p> The American Family Policy Institute's mission is to monitor and report on abuses of constitutional rights in our public schools, violations of parental authority and freedom of religion. AFPI spends thousands of man-hours each year investigating alleged constitutional violations. Once an investigation is completed and violations confirmed, AFPI uses its numerous media contacts to bring national attention to the findings of the investigation.
<p> Through its contacts with several public-interest law groups, (such as The Rutherford Institute, The Liberty Counsel, and The Alliance Defense Fund) AFPI sees that the appropriate legal action is taken to defend the constitutional rights of individuals, provide a legal remedy of victims governmental abuse, prevent repeated violations from happening again and in some cases help the victims receive compensation. Though its resource list, AFPI provides information to the American people so that they can take a pro-active roll in running and controlling their schools, community and nation.
