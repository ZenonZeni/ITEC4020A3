<hr><p>
<body>
The U.S. Congress has assigned responsibility for the nation's nuclear waste disposal system to
the Department of Energy. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (1982) and its amendments directed 
the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of 
Energy to develop, construct, and operate a system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste disposal, including a permanent geologic repository, interim storage capability
and transportation system.
<p>
Since the late 1950s, the American people have relied more and more on nuclear energy. Nuclear
power plants now supply about one-fifth of the electricity we use to light and heat our homes,
schools, factories, offices, and farms. The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management is
responsible for the planning, research, and management necessary to dispose of spent nuclear fuel produced by commercial nuclear power plants and Government owned high-level radioactive waste. 
<p>
<strong>A Temporary Solution</strong>
<p>
Currently, as the nuclear fuel that generates electricity in reactors is used, or "spent," and is no
longer efficient to fuel a reactor, it is removed and stored in specially designed pools of water, or
in some instances, placed into heavy, thick-walled metal or concrete structures for above-ground
dry storage at reactor sites. Such storage has been proven safe, but is only intended to be a
temporary solution. 
<p>
A temporary storage facility would provide earlier waste acceptance capability for spent nuclear
fuel. This facility may be in the form of an interim storage facility, a specially designed,
above-ground structure that would receive spent nuclear fuel from utilities and store it until a
repository opens. A related interim storage approach involves the use of a multi-purpose canister
(MPC). An MPC would be loaded with spent nuclear fuel assemblies, and then sealed at each
reactor site. Rather than handle individual spent nuclear fuel assemblies directly at other transfer
points in the disposal system, the MPC could then be placed inside other containers specially
designed for either transportation, interim storage or permanent disposal. An MPC-based system
offers a uniform approach to handle and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  (In response to budgetary
constraints for the civilian radioactive waste management program in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM
will not pursue development of an MPC system beyond the initial design stage.)
<p>
<strong>Transportation</strong>
<p>
Another important element of the waste management system is transportation. In order to safely
and efficiently move radioactive waste around the country, the Department of Energy has been
developing special containers, or "casks," for highway and rail transport, and is working with
state, local, and tribal officials to ensure appropriate emergency response capabilities. The
rugged, thick-walled casks are designed with protection of the public and the environment in
mind, even in hypothetical accident situations.  These designs must pass a series of rigorous
safety tests in order to be certified for use by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal
agency with responsibility for licensing nuclear facilities and approving transportation methods.
<p>
<strong>Repository</strong>
<p>
The final element of the waste management system is known as a permanent geologic repository.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, directed the Department of Energy to concentrate its site characterization studies at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine its suitability as a safe disposal site for spent nuclear fuel.
Teams of scientists are studying the mountain from the surface as well as from underground
tunnels to test such characteristics as the likelihood of volcanic or earthquake activity, or
potential movement of water through the mountain. The depth of the proposed repository would
be about 300 meters (1,000 feet) below the surface of the mountain but still about 240 meters
(800 feet) above the water table within a very hard layer of rock called volcanic tuff. If the site is
found suitable, and compliance with regulatory requirements can be met, operation is scheduled
to start in 2010. If it is found unsuitable, studies will be stopped, the site will be restored, and
DOE will report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action.
<p>
<strong>The Nuclear Waste Fund</strong>
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established a specific funding mechanism for developing the
waste disposal system, the Nuclear Waste Fund. Funds are collected from those who use
electricity produced by nuclear reactors rather than the general taxpayer. <a href="fundfct.htm">(See the fact sheet on Program Funding.)</a>
