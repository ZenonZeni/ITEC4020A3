Basically, the amount of information you provide about yourself when you surf the Internet depends on:
<UL>
<LI>the type of Internet connection you use (Is it behind a firewall? Is it from a commerical online service provider?), and
<LI>the kind of browser you are using (and whether you have configured the browser options accurately.)
</UL>
The CGI script for the CDT Privacy Demonstration reflects information that
is obtained from commands such as &quot;finger&quot; and &quot;whois&quot;.  These commands can
be run on any Unix computer that is connected to the Internet.  The script
executes these commands and displays some of the information reported by
those commands.
<P>
Obtaining the visitor's e-mail address is a bit more tricky.  The script
uses a browser &quot;loophole&quot; to obtain that information.  <A HREF="#FTP">(The &quot;trick&quot;
involves anonymous FTP and reading FTP logs.)</A>  Not all browsers have this
&quot;loophole&quot;.  This is why e-mail addresses will appear for some site
visitors, but not others.
<P>
The script also utilizes a JAVA bug that &quot;makes&quot; a user with a particular
browser send e-mail to a predesignated address.  (This JAVA bug has been corrected in the latest versions
of the browser.)  We have set up an automatic reply message that informs
the visitor that they &quot;accidently&quot; sent e-mail to us just by visiting our
site.
<P>
The information you see about yourself when you visit the site is nothing
that a knowledgeable Internet user or web site owner <STRONG>could</STRONG> obtain about
you.  CDT had the assistance of <A HREF="thank_you.html">three knowledgeable programmers</A>, but as a public interest non-profit
organization, our technical resources aren't very sophisticated.  Imagine
what a well-financed web site operation that includes registration and
tracking software <STRONG>could</STRONG> learn about you.
<P>
An added note: sometimes not all information about a visitor is displayed
because response times with the server may be slow.  This explains why
someone may get more or less information with repeat visits.

<STRONG>Anonymous FTP and the <IMG SRC="/eyeball.gif" ALT="Eye"></STRONG>
<P>
Many computers on the Internet have public areas (FTP sites) where interested users can connect and obtain files.  These users do not have to be registered users of the site.  When a non-registered user connects to a &quot;public&quot; computer to obtain a file, the user is said to be using anonymous File Transfer Protocol, or anonymous FTP.  Many FTP sites ask users who connect anonymously to use their e-mail address as the password into the system.
<P>
When a user visits the Demonstration site, they obtain the graphic of the Eye by using anonymous FTP.  When some web browsers perform anonymous FTP transactions, they automatically use the e-mail address that is configured in the browser preferences as a password into the system.  After the visitor obtains the Eye graphic, the script grabs the password (the e-mail address) from the FTP transaction log that is kept for all FTP transactions and displays it to the site visitor.
<P>
Newer web browsers have changed this convention when using anonymously FTP.  They now use a standard password instead of the e-mail address that is configured in the browser settings.
