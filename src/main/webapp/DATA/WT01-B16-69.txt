<P>
Ionizing radiation can have a significant effect on biological processes:  it can therefore damage living organisms. Regulations on radiation exposures limit the amount of radiation that can be received by workers in the industry and the general public in any one year and in a lifetime.  Isolation of waste protects against radiation exposures. 
<P>
The risk from radioactive wastes is predominantly that of direct radiation exposure to nuclear industry workers in their working environment before disposal.  After disposal, slow degradation of repository systems may lead to a small risk of exposure to the general public principally through possible leakage into groundwater.  Disposal sites are studied to establish the movement of the groundwater in order to minimise the extent of this possible leakage.  Assessments already carried out in various countries to evaluate the safety of nuclear fuel disposal have concluded that even in the worst case future human exposure to ionising radiation from a deep geological repository would be much less than that received continuously from natural background radiation. 
<P>There is a misconception that radioactive waste can be a major problem for a million years.  After that time, the only radioactivity left will be from the long-lived isotopes such as the actinides and from the shorter-lived products of their breakdown.  Amounts will depend on whether the used fuel has been directly disposed of or reprocessed and vitrified.  The potential risk from the waste declines over time with the radioactivity, and with it the need for isolation lessens. This is particularly true for the elements, like most of the fission products, that have more demanding isolation requirements. Their decay will be almost entirely complete within one thousand years. The transuranic elements like plutonium stay toxic for longer, but are less demanding to isolate.  Therefore, the growing uncertainty about future protection of disposal sites as time passes is matched by the declining risk from the waste. 
<P>In contrast, many non-radioactive wastes routinely produced in other industries are stable, which means they never decay and never lose their toxicity.
