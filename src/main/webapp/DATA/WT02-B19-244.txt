<B>Guidelines for publishing in <I>Exceptional Children</b></I>
(approximately 4 printed pages)<br>
Journal of The Council for Exceptional Children<p>
<b>Purpose of <I>Exceptional Children</I></b>
<I>Exceptional Children</I> is the research journal of The Council for Exceptional
Children. It
presents research and analyses on:<br>
<ul> <li>Education and development of exceptional infants,
toddlers, children, and youth. <br>
<li>Professional issues and policies relevant to exceptional
infants, toddlers, children, and youth.</UL><p>
 All research that is published in <I>Exceptional Children</I>
should have implications for practice, and these must be stated in the article.
Manuscripts
that focus on practical methods and materials for classroom use should be submitted to
<I>TEACHING Exceptional Children,</I> the CEC journal that is specifically for
teachers of children
with disabilities and children who are gifted. <P><I>Exceptional Children</I> does
not accept poetry,
accounts of personal experiences, or nondatabased reports on innovative techniques,
programs, or models. Surveys of opinions, correlational studies of assessment
instruments,
and outdated studies are rarely accepted. <P>
<b>Writing for <I>Exceptional Children</I></b><P>
 While <I>Exceptional Children</I> is the research journal, its articles are read by a
much broader
audience, than just researchers. Therefore, articles written for <I>Exceptional
Children</I> need
to be written for this broader audience. Articles should not be viewed as shortened
versions
of dissertation or technical reports, but rather as a way to inform other researchers,
school
administrators, state department personnel, service providers, teachers, parents, and
others
about your research and its implications for practice. Articles must be clear and concise.
To best meet the needs of the broader audience, consider the following questions as you
prepare your manuscript: <P>
<I>Introduction</I><P>
<ul> <li>Why is your research needed?<br>
<li>What are 2 to 3 key points the reader needs to
understand before reading about what you did?<br>
<LI>Is the tone positive?<br>
<li>Have you
successfully communicated in less than 5 pages, and ideally in 2 to 3 pages?
</UL><P>
<I>Methodology</I><br>
<ul> <LI>Have you provided enough general information in a way that a lay
reader can
understand what you have done?
<LI>Have you provided a source of further information
about methodology for the researcher who wants to replicate your research?
</UL><P>
<I>Results</I><br>
<ul> <LI>Have you organized your results in a way that promotes the
understanding of your
findings?      <LI>Have you provided the necessary details for the researcher without
making
it difficult for others to read? </UL><p>
<I>Discussion</I><br>
<ul><LI> What are the 2 to 3 key points that need to be made about your
findings?   <LI>What
limitations are there on your research and its findings?    <LI>What are the practical
implications of your findings?     <LI>What are the next steps to be taken? <P>
<B>Manuscript Requirements</b></UL><p>
 Manuscripts sent to <I>Exceptional Children</I> are submitted to a review process
only if they
meet the following criteria:  <ul> <LI>Content is original, not previously
published (in whole
or in part), and not under consideration elsewhere.    <LI>Format conforms to the
standards
in the <L>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</L> (4th
edition, 1994),
with two exceptions:     (1)  footnotes should not be used  (2)  reproductions
of figures (rather than professionally prepared figures) may be sent for the review
process.
<LI>Language conforms to the recommendations outlined in Guidelines for Reporting
and
Writing About People with Disabilities (Research and Training Center on Independent
Living, 4th edition, 1995). 
<LI>Four copies are submitted, with authors identified only
on the title page, along with a cover letter stating that the manuscript is original work,
not
previously published, and not under consideration elsewhere.
<LI>While under review
(until the author receives word of a decision from <I>Exceptional Children</I>), the
journal has
exclusive options on possible publication. The manuscript should not be submitted
elsewhere.</UL><P> 
<B>Review Process</B><P>
Selection of manuscripts for publication is based on a blind peer review process.
However,
all manuscripts are screened first. Those manuscripts that do not meet the manuscript
requirements, or that are not consistent with the purpose of the journal, are not
forwarded
for peer review. The author either is notified that the manuscript is not acceptable for
<I>Exceptional Children</I>, or is requested to make changes in the manuscript so
that it meets
requirements. Copies of the manuscript are not returned to the author in either
case.<P>
Manuscripts that are not screened out and that are consistent with the purpose of the
journal are sent out for peer review. Reviewers will not know the identity of the
author.<P>
Manuscripts are evaluated by reviewers on several criteria. The field editor evaluation
form
that is used is shown on page 4. <p>Based on the blind reviews, the Associate editors
and/or
co-editors will communicate the results of that review to the author. The decision that is
communicated to the author will be one of the following:    <P>
<UL><LI> Acceptable, with routine
editing   <LI>Acceptable, with revisions indicated by editor   
<LI>Unacceptable</UL><P>
When a decision
is made that a manuscript is unacceptable for <I>Exceptional Children</I>, it may
be
recommended that it be sent to a journal of one of the CEC Divisions. This
recommendation
does not mean that the manuscript would be automatically accepted by a Division
journal;
the manuscript would have to go through the review process again. The following are
the
CEC Division periodicals and the focus of each:        <P>
