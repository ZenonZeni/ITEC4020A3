<H3>2. Pacific Northwest DSM Successes</H3>

<BR>
In 1995, the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana) 
was enjoying nearly 900 average megawatts of electricity savings as a 
result of DSM efforts - annual savings equivalent to the power output 
of four good-sized gas-fired combustion turbines. Conserved energy totaled 
over 50,000 gigawatt-hours in 1995 at an average cost of 2 to 2-1/2 cents 
per kilowatt-hour - well below the next most costly resource 
alternative available. These DSM programs were saving retail consumers $2 
billion per year while avoiding carbon dioxide emissions of approximately 
5.35 million metric tons annually.<a href="#93" name="r93"> [ 93 ] </a><BR>
<p>     <BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="PortlandEnergyOffice">Portland Energy Office<a>. </B></I>In 1993, Portland, Oregon 
became the first U.S. city to adopt a local carbon dioxide reduction 
strategy, committing to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent 
below 1988 baselines by the year 2010. This target is a greater reduction 
than the United States committed to under the 1992 Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.<a href="#94" name="r94"> [ 94 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      Portland's "Multifamily Energy Savings" program, initiated in 
1987, exemplifies the city's long-standing commitment to energy 
efficiency. It is intended to target the split incentive between landlord 
and tenants - where tenants typically pay utility bills, leaving 
landlords little incentive to make efficiency improvements. The program 
encourages retrofits by marketing existing efficiency services - such 
as utility audits, rebates and loans, plus state tax credits - to 
building owners. By promoting a diverse package of financial incentives, 
the program has made building owners in Portland surprisingly receptive to 
investing in energy-efficiency measures like windows, insulation, common 
area lighting, water heaters, air sealing, and heating system 
improvements. To date, the program has weatherized more than 11,050 
apartment units, producing savings of approximately 1,200 kilowatt-hours 
annually per unit. The highly successful program saved 1,412 
megawatt-hours (avoiding 151 metric tons of carbon dioxide) in 1993 alone, 
and should save 375,570 megawatt-hours over the projected life-cycle of 
the improvements (avoiding 40,186 metric tons of carbon dioxide). It 
achieved these savings at a cost of less than 1 cent per kilowatt-hour 
saved.<a href="#95" name="r95"> [ 95 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="BonnevillePowerAdministration">Bonneville Power Administration </a></B></I>. The city of 
Ashland, Oregon developed one of America's premier resource conservation 
initiatives in a small community. The city's Conservation Division worked 
with the Bonneville Power Administration - the region's wholesale power 
supplier - to implement a range of energy-efficiency measures, for both 
new construction and retrofits, that conserve electricity, gas and water, 
and reduce waste. The measures include weatherization, "Good Cents" new 
homes, showerheads, and composting. More than half the savings have been 
generated in the residential sector, lowering customers' bills and 
improving occupants' comfort. Ashland has also addressed the land-use 
implications of development, and has implemented a comprehensive set of 
land-use ordinances to minimize negative aspects of development. For 
example, the city rewards resource efficiency in new developments by 
issuing "conservation bonuses" that allow developers to build more units 
than normal, increasing density while easing travel, sprawl, and demands 
on gasoline and air quality. Ashland's comprehensive resource-efficiency 
approach has created nearly 10,000 megawatt-hours in annual savings while 
cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 1,070 metric tons annually. Cumulative 
savings from 1980 through 1994 come to 66,000 megawatt-hours of 
electricity and 7,062 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Over the 
life-cycle of the efficiency installations, more 26,000 metric tons of 
carbon dioxide will be saved.<a href="#96" name="r96"> [ 96 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      Bonneville's "WaterWise" program is an agricultural initiative 
that involves a comprehensive effort to conserve irrigation water and 
energy while improving crop yields, thanks to the precision application of 
water. WaterWise provides technical, financial and informational services 
to farmers east of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon. The 
program focuses on irrigation system testing and design work, hardware 
retrofits (including low pressure, mainline, and pump modification 
equipment), and irrigation management, and it provides farmers with 
detailed information on weather patterns and evapotranspiration rates for 
optimal crop watering. For an investment of $24.5 million, Bonneville has 
saved 506.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity over the decade 1983 through 
1993 - which corresponds to a carbon dioxide emissions savings of more 
than 61,250 metric tons. Over the life-cycle of the improvements installed 
during that decade, 1,419 gigawatt-hours will be saved, reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions by 171,700 metric tons.<a href="#97" name="r97"> [ 97 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      Bonneville Power administered an Aluminum Smelter Conservation/ 
Modernization program in the late 1980s that was responsible for enormous 
energy savings. The ten primary smelters in Bonneville's service territory 
consume one-third of all Bonneville power - 15 percent of all 
electricity used in the Northwest (sold by Bonneville and other 
utilities). Aluminum production is a highly electricity-intensive 
industry, with electricity purchases comprising roughly 25 percent of 
operating costs. The objective of the Conservation/ Modernization program 
was to encourage smelters to improve the efficiency of their industrial 
processes, both to remain competitive and to free up electric supply for 
other Northwest uses. Bonneville paid the smelters incentive payments for 
baseline efficiency improvements equal to half a cent per kilowatt-hour 
saved over a 10-year period, which is about one-third of the cost of 
efficiency improvements. The program has achieved electricity savings of 
4.1 percent of total industrial sales - equal to 1,057.8 gigawatt-hours 
saved per year, and 225,311 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
reduced annually.<a href="#98" name="r98"> [ 98 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="PugetSoundPower&Light">Puget Sound Power & Light</a></B>.</I> Puget Power's 
"Commercial and Industrial Electricity Conservation Service," begun in 
late 1978, was one of the first DSM programs to be offered to the 
commercial sector. Puget's philosophy has been to provide valuable 
customer services while controlling load growth. Puget's staff includes a 
highly-trained cadre of engineers with the technical expertise necessary 
to analyze commercial and industrial facilities. Their analyses have taken 
a whole-facility, customized approach; they look at all facets of 
electricity use and assess efficiency upgrades, including process systems, 
the building envelope, space conditioning, lighting applications, and 
water heating improvements. Puget uses a total resource cost basis for 
measuring cost effectiveness, and pays for upgrades based on the utility's 
avoided cost, a value that reflects the full life-cycle of each 
improvement. Typical incentive payments equal 60 to 80 percent of 
customers' total installation costs - a level that significantly 
exceeds most utility rebate programs. Puget generally ends up paying out 
about half its avoided cost. For instance, in 1992 the program cost an 
average of 3.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, while its avoided cost for 
measures with an average life-cycle of 15 years was 6.5 cents per 
kilowatt-hour. Efficiency improvements installed during 1992 saved 122 
gigawatt-hours in that year (16,958 metric tons of carbon dioxide saved) 
at a cost of $25.5 million, with life-cycle energy savings from those 
improvements totaling 1,823 gigawatt-hours, which should cut carbon 
dioxide emissions by 253,397 metric tons. Since the program began, the 
life-cycle savings of improvements installed between 1978 and 1992 are 
6,356 gigawatt-hours at a total cost of $101.25 million, avoiding 883,484 
metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.<a href="#99" name="r99"> [ 99 ] </a>

 <p>     <A NAME="SeattleCityLight">Seattle City Light<a></B>.</I> Seattle City Light, one of the 
nation's largest municipal utilities, reinforces the notion that utilities 
can effectively offer DSM services in regions characterized by low power 
rates. In 1993, Seattle City Light budgeted a precedent-setting 9.1 
percent of gross revenues for DSM. The utility's early emphasis on energy 
efficiency, however, came only after a lawsuit overturned the utility's 
planned investment in the <A NAME="WashingtonPublicPowerSupplySystem">Washington Public Power Supply System<a> (WPPSS), a 
proposed series of nuclear plants. The WPPSS decision changed the 
utility's course, prodding it to become one of the nation's leaders in 
energy efficiency.<BR>
<p>    <p>      Seattle City Light's comprehensive DSM programs cover the 
residential, commercial and industrial sectors, and have included 
weatherization, lighting, energy-efficient water heaters, and water 
efficiency measures, as well as industrial and commercial efficiency 
improvements for motors and HVAC systems. This success has been supported 
by the Bonneville Power Administration, which over time has funded nearly 
one-quarter of Seattle City Light's DSM expenditures. In 1993, efficiency 
improvements installed that year cut energy demand by 52,629 
megawatt-hours (producing a carbon dioxide reduction of 7,315 metric 
tons), which will save 885,294 megawatt-hours over the life-cycle of those 
improvements (reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 123,055 metric tons). 
Cumulatively, since the DSM programs began in 1978, Seattle City Light 
efficiency programs have saved 2,454,256 megawatt-hours (341,141 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide). Over the life-cycle of the installations, 
7,380,743 megawatt-hours will be saved - for a total life-cycle carbon 
dioxide reduction of 1,025,923 metric tons.<BR>
