ABB REORGANIZED TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE

Dr Richard J Slember, president, ABB Power Plant Operations (US),
headquartered in Stamford, Conn, announces several changes in the areas of
sales/marketing, nuclear systems, fossil systems, services, controls, and
R&D. These changes, made public over the last few weeks, are a major part
of Slember's plan to build a more closely knit organization--one that can
"get the synergy out of ABB" and better serve the customer.
   Slember, who joined ABB Asea Brown Boveri in November 1990, told Power
that he expects to make a few more announcements in the coming months as he
fine-tunes his organization; however, these will be primarily personnel
assignments and not involve structural changes to the organization.
   Unified sales force. Perhaps the most significant of Slember's recent
announcements is the appointment of Michael Bray to head a newly formed,
unified US sales force to serve all units of ABB Power Plant Operations
except the nuclear and services groups. The new organization is now ABB's
primary interface with electric utilities for boilers, steam and gas
turbines, environmental control equipment, and powerplant controls.
   It was created in response to feedback from utilities, which had
requested a more focused customer-service organization. Says Slember, "This
action brings together an unparalleled offering in meeting customer
requirements. ABB, with a single organization, can now meet the customer's
needs for the entire powerplant, from fuel feed to stack."
   The Power Plant Operations sales force will operate from five regional
offices, coordinated by Bray from ABB's Windsor (Conn) facility. Regional
vice presidents are Andrew Cook, East, based in Windsor; Michael Salerno,
Southwest, Atlanta; Steven Deabler, Southwest, Dallas; Vincent Pacello,
Central, Chicago. The western regional vice president, to be located in
California, is still unnamed.
   Nuclear. Dr Shelby Brewer is appointed chairman, ABB Combustion
Engineering Nuclear Power, with responsibility for strategic customers,
government relations, and long-term positioning of the company's nuclear
businesses. Brewer joined Combustion Engineering Inc in 1984 as vice
president of operations for the Nuclear Power Systems Div.
   In a related appointment, Peter S Van Nort is named president, ABB
Combustion Engineering Nuclear Power, responsible for the operations of ABB
Impell and the company's nuclear-power business units: systems, fuel
services, and associated staff. Van Nort has been with ABB for about a
year, serving in upper-management positions.
   Boilers. Frank Fagan is appointed senior manager of ABB's boiler
business. Fagan, with over 30 years of experience in fossil-fueled
steam-generation technology and most recently president of ABB Combustion
Engineering Services Inc, will concentrate on developing ABB's global
boiler strategies and on optimizing the implementation of those strategies
in the US marketplace.
   Services. David M Gray becomes president, ABB Combustion Engineering
Services, replacing Fagan (see above). Gray, with extensive executive and
operations experience in the boiler business--most recently as vice
president of fossil services--is responsible for all service-related work
on operating boilers, world-wide. These services include all of the parts
and components used to maintain, rehabilitate, and upgrade boilers; the
engineering and design work to support that effort; field engineering
services; and training, testing, and analysis services. Gray's group also
is involved in the construction of new boilers, precipitators, scrubbers,
and related powerplant equipment, and provides commissioning services for
new boilers.
   Gray told Power that he sees a large amount of clean-air-related service
work down the road, but that this activity has not yet started in earnest
because federal and state regulations governing powerplant emissions are
not "final." Today, the boiler-service business essentially is in a
no-growth period, with activity dominated by normal rehabilitation
andpressure-part work. Considerable effort also is going into planning with
customers to ensure a prompt response to regulatory requirements when
specific clean-air guidelines are announced. One change in the services
business as it was envisioned only a few years ago, according to Gray, is
that many utilities are now looking to shut down old boilers rather than to
extend their life--this to facilitate complying with expected clean-air
statutes.
   Controls. Edward H Verdery is appointed president of ABB's new Power
Plant Controls business unit, incorporating the following preexisting
company operations: fossil instrumentation and control operations from
ABB's old Power Automation, Fossil Systems, and Fossil Services units and
the powerplant training simulator and computer businesses of the Power
Automation and Nuclear groups.
   In making this organizational change, Slember notes "In the past, the
powerplant operator had to use a piecemeal approach for plant control,
using equipment from various vendors for each part of the plant--for
example, boilers, turbines, or environmental control. We now have greater
breadth of offering in plant control and can match the control system to
the equipment, to optimize plant performance." The objective of integrated
controls is to lower costs to the operator, increase plant availability,
and minimize pollutant emissions.
   R&D. Finally, in an effort to weave a technology network from Europe to
the US, Slember names Dr Gernot Gessinger vice president of research and
technology. In his newly created position, Gessinger, a 20-yr ABB veteran,
is responsible for the establishment of R&D programs for all ABB Power
Plant operation in the US.

IN AN UNDERTAKING AS COMPLEX AND COSTLY AS POWERPLANT DEVELOPMENT--WHERE
STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DESIGN AND
OPERATION OF A PLANT--PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS MUST BE AMPLY PREPARED FOR
REGULATORY AND PUBLIC OVERSIGHT.

By:
Marie Leone

At least one industry expert, Peter Mason, Bechtel Corp, San Francisco,
Calif, suggests the simple old-fashioned matrix system. He says this
evaluation tool has been successfully tested with nuclear powerplants, and
can easily be adapted to other types of facilities. In a talk to the recent
ASME Joint Power Generation Conference, Mason pointed out that many
technical issues relating to power-project work originate as safety or
environmental licensing concerns, often tied to legislation. He cites as a
good example the nuclear industry's design review process which takes place
before and after project completion. Often sparked by internal or external
audits, inspections, reviews, and/or employee concerns, intervenor
allegations, or hearing contentions, such issues can potentially delay, or
in some extreme cases, terminate projects--as was the case with the
Shoreham nuclear plant in New York which was prohibited from operating
commercially after construction and testing were complete.
   Mason's proactive approach includes a review, resolution, and analysis
of the issues and their root cause. By identifying and listing issues and
setting up cause matrices, project planners and plant-design experts can
identify problems before they become unmanageable, says Mason, who cites
the following example: The matrix evaluation method is used to design and
build a new waste-to-energy plant. After the plant begins operation, a
public citizen's group raises safety concerns about the type of waste fuel
being used and the toxicity of the ash. Local environmental regulators
question the plant owners, who in turn, are able to use the matrix to round
up information and redirect the questions back to relevant technical
documentation. Asa result, a convenient record of consistent information is
supplied to support the plant owner's decisions and safety-design
strategies.
   The matrix approach is designed to prevent those involved in project
development from overreacting or being scarred off by problems that can be
solved, notes Mason, adding that the issue-resolution step must remain a
technical, not a legal or quality-assurance matter, and thus must start
with a strong technical basis. More importantly, the process provides a
history of potential problems and technical resolutions so there is a
reference file for new powerplants. Often, problems that management assumes
are new have actually occurred before and have been solved, but the
"corporate memory" fails, says Mason.

RECENT COURT RULINGS AND LAWSUITS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE WASTE-TO-ENERGY
(WTE) PLANTS, AS WELL AS COAL-FIRED FACILITIES, HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED
FOR DEFINITIVE REGULATION ON ASH FROM POWERPLANTS.

By:
Marie Leone

In a decision that may go before the US Supreme Court, a federal appeals
court has ruled that ash generated by municipal-solid-waste (MSW) burning
plants is subject to regulation as a hazardous waste (Subtitle C) under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The decision by the US Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reverses a lower court decision based on
a 1988 lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Washington,
DC, against the city of Chicago. The latest decision raises the possibility
of higher disposal costs for MSW facilities located in Wisconsin, Indiana,
and Illinois--the court's jurisdiction. However, industry observers say
that the decision will not have a significant impact because most ash
tested under the existing EPA procedures does not exceed the regulatory
threshold for hazardous wastes, reports Independent Power Report, a
McGraw-Hill Inc newsletter. But although this particular ruling may not
hurt the industry, the fact that no clear-cut rule exists leaves the door
open for future complications that could aggravate project development,
warn industry sources.
   For example, based on a 1980 EPA rule, Congress voted to exempt
"household waste" from RCRA's definition of hazardous waste. In an effort
to further clarify the exemption, Congress added a section to the law in
1984 stating that a waste-to-energy plant "shall not be deemed to be
treating, storing, disposing of, or otherwise managing hazardous wastes, so
long as the plant receives and burns only household waste or solid waste
from commercial or industrial sources that does not contain hazardous
wastes." Since then, industry experts have interpreted this to mean that if
the fuel-waste delivered to the plant is not hazardous, then it follows
that the ash coming out is non-hazardous as well, and should be categorized
under RCRA's Subtitle D. However, the recent Chicago ruling disallowed that
interpretation. Chief Judge William Bauer wrote in the majority opinion
that the "ash is fundamentally different in its chemical and physical
composition from the plastic, paper, and other rubbish that goes in."
   Regarding coal, the Oregon-based Citizens Interested in Bull Run Inc is
suing EPA to force a decision about whether to regulate coal-combustion
waste by electric-utility plants as hazardous or non-hazardous. Under the
1980 RCRA amendments, EPA was ordered to complete a report on
coal-combustion wastes and finalize a rule no later than six months after
the completion of the report. Although the report was completed in 1988,
EPA has yet to make a decision on the classification of coal ash. The
primary concern over disposal of the waste is the potential for leachate to
contaminate groundwater. Small quantities of arsenic, barium, cadmium,
lead, mercury, selenium, and other contaminants are known to be present in
coal ash.
   A decision to characterize coal-combustion wastes as hazardous will
significantly raise ash-disposal costs for coal-fired plants, say industry
observers. That becomes important when considering new generating capacity
and comparing the cost of coal-fired plants with other options. Note that
key members of Congress are pushing to amend RCRA sometime this year
(Power, December 1991, p 9).

DRAFT LEGISLATION AIMED AT SUBSIDIZING THE RENEWABLE-ENERGY INDUSTRY IS
DRAWING FIRE FROM INDUSTRY GROUPS.

By:
Marie Leone

The House proposal would establish a 2.5 cents/kWh incentive payment for a
total of 10 years for electricity produced from solar, wind, biomass, and
certain forms of geothermal energy. To pay for the incentive, Congress
would impose a user fee averaging one-third of a mill (one-thirtieth of a
cent) per kWh on electric generation. The fee would be capped at one-half
mill per kWh.
   The Edison Electric Institute, Washington DC, opposes the draft, saying
it is an energy tax that would skew the energy market. In addition, a
spokesman for the National Assn of Regulatory Utility Commissions (Naruc)
says Naruc will oppose the proposal, noting that although "we support
renewable energy, our traditional policy is to oppose energy fees or taxes
imposed by the federal government because in the end they are passed on to
the ratepayers."
   Conversely, representatives from the renewable energy industry maintain
that the proposal would firmly establish the US as a leader in renewable
energy technology and help renewables find a permanent place in the US
energy supply mix.

TECHNICAL PROFILES OF CURRENT PROJECTS AS REPORTED IN MCGRAW-HILL ENERGY
GROUP'S ELECTRIC UTILITY WEEK, INDEPENDENT POWER REPORT, AND NUCLEONICS
WEEK NEWSLETTERS

Utilities in the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) say peak
demand will increase by an average of 1.9%/yr through 1999. To meet this
growth, utilities plan to add 6631 MW of net operable capacity during the
decade. Figure includes new construction and reactivation of units now in
cold shutdown. The only utilities in the region planning more than 500 MW
of new construction are Arizona Public Service Co (535 MW), Los Angeles
Dept of Water & Power (506 MW), Nevada Power Co (710 MW), Sacramento
Municipal Utility District (550 MW), and San Diego Gas & Electric Co (698
MW). All of the new capacity would be gas-fired peaking or combined-cycle
units. The only base-load units in the forecast are the expected return to
service of Public Service Co of Colorado's Ft St. Vrain nuclear plant as a
gas-fired steam/electric unit in 1995 and Southern California Edison Co's
reactivation of the oil-fired, 320-MW Alamitos Unit 3 in 1996, oil-fired,
126-MW San Bernardino Units 1 and 2 in 1997, oil-fired, 132-MW Etiwanda
Unit 1 in 1998, gas-fired, 215-MW Huntington Beach Unit 3 in 1999, and the
gas-fired, 180-MW Highgrove Unit 3 in 1999. Non-utility generation (NUG)
additions in the region are expected to total 2655 in the 1991-1999
period. Utilities planning more than 200 MW of NUGs are Nevada Power (377
MW), Pacific Gas & Electric Co (498 MW), Public Service Colorado (628 MW),
Puget Sound Power & Light Co (296 MW), and Southern California Edison (514
MW). Major new-capacity additions by utilities in the WSCC region include
the following: Portland General Electric Co, a 210-MW combined-cycle plant
for operation in July 1998; Arizona Public Service, three 70-MW combustion
turbines in 1998, two more in 1999, and another in year 2000; LADWP, a
240-MW combined-cycle in 1994, plus unspecified additions of 100 MW in
1997, 1999, and 2000 and 200 MW in 1998; Nevada Power, combined-cycle
conversions of Clark Units 5 and 6 in 1993 and Units 7 and 8 in 1994, plus
70-MW combustion-turbine additions in 1994, 1995, and 1996; San Diego Gas
& Electric, 230-MW combined-cycles in 1995 and 1996 and 224-MW combined
cycles in 1998 and 2000; SMUD plans to add its 550 MW in 1996, but no
details are available. Houston Lighting & Power Co plans a 160-MW,
gas-fired cogeneration project at a DuPont Corp facility in LaPorte, Tex,
that would be owned by the utility as a traditional rate-based plant.
Commercial operation of the $120-million (not including land, switchyard,
and transmission expenses) facility is expected in mid 1995 . . . Black
Hills Power & Light Co asks the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to waive
a permit application for its proposed 80-MW, coal-fired Simpson Unit 2 so
the utility can begin construction by August 1993 . . . Thermo Electron
Corp, Energy Systems Div, Waltham, Mass, selects United Engineers &
Constructors Inc to design a 21-MW, biomass-fired powerplant in Delano,
Calif. A fluidized-bed boiler will be installed. Construction start is
expected in the spring of 1992; project completion by the end of 1993 . . .
US Windpower Inc, Livermore, Calif, and InterCoast Energy Co, a unit of
Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Co, form a joint venture--WindRiver
Development Co, Davenport, Iowa--to develop at least 250 MW of
wind-generated capacity in the Midwest . . . Wheelabrator Environmental
Systems, Hampton, NH, joins Decker Energy International Inc, Winter Haven,
Fla, as a partner in a 40-MW woodwaste- and waste-tire-fired project in
Polk County, Fla, near Lakeland. Schedule calls for a January 1994
startup, but state and federal air permits have not yet been obtained . . .
Southern Electric International Inc, Atlanta, Ga, considers
co-developing a $20-million office-paper recycling plant with DeNovo Corp,
Washington, DC, that would use 60,000 lb/hr of steam from SEI's planned
220-MW, pulverized-coal-fired cogeneration project near Fredricksburg, Va.
The powerplant project was selected by Virginia Power in its 1989
solicitation under the assumption that a steam host could be developed . . .
General Electric Co, Schenectady, NY, estimates that about 69,000 MW of
NUG capacity will be ordered in the US between 1991 and year 2000, with
the Southeast the most significant market region in the 1990s. Estimate is
higher than those of others because the GE number is for plant orders
rather than completed facilities . . . East Kentucky Power Cooperative Inc
selects its own bid for 300 MW of gas-fired peaking capacity, needed by
mid-1995, over those from 11 private developers. The utility based 60% of
the bid scoring on price, remainder on non-price criteria such as
reliability and environmental issues. . . Texas Utilities Electric Co's
"information request" soliciting cogenerators and independent power
producers for expressions of interest for long-term, firm generating
capacity--the utility plans to add nearly 2200 MW by the end of the
decade--brings replies from 48 developers. The 102 projects proposed
included 83 gas- and 12 coal-fired facilities . . . The village of Green
Island, NY, selects American Ref-Fuel, Houston, Tex, to build a
$250-million, 1500-ton/day waste-to-energy plant . . . Pinellas County,
Fla, which operates a 3150-ton/day waste-to-energy plant shelves plans to
expand facility throughput by as much as 50% because actual volumes have
fallen far below projections for several reasons, among them: drought and
related water restrictions, the economic downturn (less new construction,
fewer tourists, etc), little or no population growth, recycling of waste .
 . . Wisconsin Electric Power Co plans to build a 160-MW cogen plant at the
largest paper mill in the state--Repap Wisconsin Inc's Kimberly facility .
 . . KVA Resources Inc, Bellevue, Wash, agrees to joint-venture with
Columbia Aluminum to build a 210-MW, gas-fired combined-cycle plant near
the John Day dam on the Columbia River that would intertie at a substation
at the smelter. If permitting proceeds according to plan, the plant could
be in operation as early as September 1993 . . . Towner Electric LP,
Minneapolis, Minn, and an unnamed utility plan to develop a 440-MW,
coal-gasification project in New Jersey that would also produce 25-million
gal/yr of methanol for use as a gasoline additive or as an alternative to
motor fuel for areas--like New Jersey--where ozone levels must be lowered
to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Power would be sold
to Public Service Electric & Gas Co under an agreement specifying that an
80% capacity factor be maintained by the new project or it would be
responsible for the cost of replacement power . . . Tennessee Valley
Authority expects to add up to 220 MW of hydroelectric capacity over the
next 10 years by investing an estimated $100-million in a retrofit program
to upgrade turbine runners. First contract in the program, for replacement
runners at Wilson and Chicamauga dams, was awarded last October to Voith
Hydro Inc, York, Pa . . . Montana Power Co's 150-MW solicitation for
deliveries beginning in 1996 attracts notices of intent to bid for 170
projects totaling about 13,500 MW . . . Plans to develop two cogeneration
and two geothermal projects totaling more than 110 MW are announced in
Oregon, including: James River Corp's (Westport) 50-MW, woodwaste-fired
powerplant that would power the expansion of the company's paper mill,
Eugene Water & Electric Bd/California Energy's 30-MW geothermal plant in
Newberry Crater, Vulcan Power Co's 30-MW geothermal plant in Newberry

COAL HANDLING AND PREPARATION
Although the basics remain the same, the many elements comprising coal
handling and preparation in the powerplant have taken on a new luster--put
there by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

By:
Thomas C Elliott, Senior Editor

Coal cleaning at the mine, transportation to the powerplant, site
unloading, stockout and storage, reclaiming, feeders and conveyors,
preparation, blending and switching, overall instrumentation and
control--these are the key topics reviewed in this report. The underlying
theme is the pervasive impact of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAA), which has so altered the thinking about powerplant operation in the
years ahead (see Power Special Report, "Clean Air Act Amendments: The
Engineering Response," June 1991). Until these amendments became law,
precombustion technologies were merely a part of the landscape, advancing
mostly as the occasion demanded. Now they are at center stage, key players
in the struggle to slash powerplant emissions at the stack before they
become problems.
   Evidence of a renewed emphasis on precombustion technologies is
compelling (also see box, p 18). For example, the idea of constructing a
common coal-preparation plant serving several large power stations is being
discussed today as a business venture similar to independent power
production. In addition, at least one midwestern utility reportedly is
investigating the construction of a centrally located coal-blending station
serving many of the utilities affected by CAA.

COAL CLEANING
   About one-third of US steam coal (over 200-million tons) is cleaned to
remove ash and sulfur impurities and to increase the coal's heating value.
Most of the costs of coal cleaning are borne by mining companies, who build
and operate the cleaning facilities and dispose of the refuse removed from
the coal in the cleaning process (Figure 1). The mining companies pass some
of these expenses along to powerplants in higher coal prices.

Clean-coal benefits
Utilities are burning more cleaned coal each year because they find that
the savings it offers in fuel handling, plant efficiency, availability, and
environmental controls compensate for the added cost. More specifically,
improved coal quality can result in:
   --A reduction of up to 20% in transportation costs.
   --Reduced pulverizer operation and maintenance (O&M) costs because there
will be less hard mineral matter to pulverize.
   --Increased boiler availability, efficiency, and life expectancy because
of reduced slagging, fouling, corrosion, and erosion.
   --Reduced electrostatic-precipitator or fabric-filter O&M costs because
there will be less particulate matter to capture.
   With the tighter controls on SO subscript 2 emissions mandated by the
CAA, it will be interesting to see in which direction utilities lean with
regard to the precombustion alternatives of coal cleaning, blending, and
purchasing of low-sulfur coals. Since the latter two are generally less
expensive, the scales may tip toward them. Even now, low-sulfur western
coals are becoming increasingly attractive compared to flue-gas
desulfurization.

Commercial techniques
   Basic coal-cleaning techniques are covered in detail in McGraw-Hill
Inc's Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering, "Coal Cleaning," Sec 4,
Pt 1, Ch 2, and in Power's Special Report, Coal cleaning, September 1981;
also, March 1987, p 76, and August 1990, p 77. However, two leading-edge
commercial techniques worth mentioning are these:
   --Improved hydraulic jig effectively cleans fine coal--a growing
challenge as new mining methods produce finer coal particles for greater
sulfur liberation. This fine-coal jig uses hydraulic separation to stratify
a bed of different-density particles through the application of a pulsating
water stream. Microprocessor-controlled air valves regulate the length of
pulsation strokes, allowing raw-coal cleaning down to 100 microns.
   --Conventional heavy-media coal-cleaning process has been refined in
this fashion: (1) A new type of magnetite is used with optimized physical
and mechanical properties, (2) the cyclone separation step is enhanced, and
(3) the recovery of magnetite has been significantly improved. These
process refinements pertain to the fines cleaning circuit only; the
coarse-material circuit is the same as a conventional prep plant.
   Processes nearing commercial status are the thermal drying of low-rank
coals, principally low-sulfur western coals, and the production of pellets
from these dried coals, which typically crumble and become very dusty. In
both cases, the objective is to reduce transportation costs and make the
coal more attractive to eastern markets.

Advanced techniques
   Some advanced techniques are these, which are at the bench-scale, pilot,
or demonstration stages:
   --Agglomeration. Here, a light hydrocarbon--such as heptane--is
introduced to agglomerate spherical coal particles. Wet, raw coal is ground
to 20 mesh, is mixed vigorously with heptane in a high-shear contactor,
then enters a low-shear mixer where asphalt is added as a binder. After
agitation, the agglomerates are drained of water and refuse particles. At
this point, steam sparging captures the heptane for reuse. Finally, the
resulting coal pellets are water-washed to remove any trace of impurities.
   --Froth flotation. This is a physical/chemical process that depends on
the attachment of air bubbles to high-carbon-content hydrophobic solids.
Separation of coal occurs as dispersed air bubbles pass through a
suspension of fine raw-coal concentrate. Additives are usually required to
enhance the hydrophobic character of the coal particles relative to the
hydrophilic nature of the mineral matter.
   --Column flotation. This process takes advantage of the differences in
surface chemistries of coal and mineral matter, which affect the way these
particles interact with water and air bubbles. The fine-refuse slurry is
introduced into an 8-ft-diameter, 22-ft-high column. Air bubbles rising
from the column's bottom help to separate coal particles from waste
material and carry them to the top of the column, where they are skimmed
off.
   --Chemical process. Here, mine-cleaned coal is treated with sodium
hydroxide and potassium hydroxide to transfer organic and pyritic sulfur
and mineral matter into the molten alkali. Because of the high density of
the caustic melt, the clean coal floats to the surface of the reactor and
is separated out. Molten caustic is recycled; the cleaned coal is further
washed with water and dilute acid.
   --Biological process. Still in the embryonic state, bioprocessing
involves the use of micro-organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to
catalyze sulfur-removal reactions. Studies show that 99% of pyritic sulfur
can be removed by the micro-organism thiobacillus ferroxidans. Especially
attractive is the use of bioprocessing for the removal of organically bound
sulfur, which is resistant to conventional coal cleaning; in the US,
research centers around removal using model compounds (dibenzothiophene,
polysulfides, and humic acids) to determine the mechanism of direct
cleavage of sulfur from coal. High cost may be an obstacle to selecting
this process.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation from mine to powerplant is via unit train, barge, truck,
overland conveyor belt, or any combination of these modes. The system
selected depends on such factors as distance from mine to plant, daily
"burn rate," location of plant site, and relative economics of competing
transportation modes.

Unit trains
   More than half of the nation's coal-fired steam generators are fed by
unit-train coal delivery (Figure 2). A typical coal train is comprised of
about 110 cars, with each car carrying about 100 tons of coal--an
11,000-ton-capacity train continuously operating back and forth between
coal source and plant like a shuttle. Many utilities own their unit trains
outright, with these benefits: reduced freight rates, better railcar
availability, greater degree of control over scheduling and maintenance.
   Of interest today are shipments of low-sulfur coal from the Powder River
Basin in Wyoming to eastern destinations. Because of CAA, this coal (at
roughly $4/ton) is becoming increasingly attractive. Fears that shortages
and bottlenecks in moving this coal eastward in the years ahead, spurred by
burgeoning demand, appear to be groundless.
   These questions most often arise: Will shipment costs rise precipitously
in a demand economy? Will there be enough railcars to handle the rising
load? Will there be enough trackage? Will scheduling be a problem? The
answers are encouraging.
   Railroad management is not about to take advantage of its good
customers, especially since coal suppliers/users form a solid base for its
overall business (annual tonnages are more than three times greater than
the second largest commodity, farm products). Although costs may rise, they
will reflect competitive conditions and not those of a captive marketplace.
While it is true that railcar manufacture annually is considerably less
than 15 years ago (100,000 cars plus vs 40,000 or so today), most cars can
accommodate more coal and weigh less (being aluminum-bodied), thus can
carry an extra five to 10 tons of coal without exceeding track weight
limitations. New routes shouldn't be necessary, although reinforcements in
selected areas, upgrading of some trackage, extended siding lengths, and
double trackage may be required. Most important, railroads generally are
run better--they operate faster, more efficiently, with better scheduling.
   With regard to freeze control, thaw sheds at the plant site are still
the most common solution to arriving shipments of frozen coal, although the
high operating costs associated with these systems restrict their use to
the largest utilities. Friable western coals are more prone to hard
freezeups because of their high fines concentrations.
   Freeze-conditioning agents (FCAs) are receiving increased attention
because of their effectiveness in many applications. Some act as an
anti-freeze while others weaken the crystalline structure of ice. A
recently introduced FCA consists of50% glycol with special wetting agents
for freeze conditioning during rail transport. A recent field study
suggests that treating the sides of a coal car with FCAs could be more
effective than treating the coal itself.

Barges
   Where feasible, barge delivery usually offers the lowest cost per
ton-mile, whether for coal or other bulk materials. As a result, US inland
waterways have been extensively developed, with most coal traffic on the
Ohio, Monogahela, Mississippi, and Tennessee rivers. A typical barge for
coal transportation is an open hopper vessel measuring 195 ft long, 35 ft
wide, 12 ft deep, and loaded to about 1500 tons at an 8- to 10-ft draft.
Typically, 15 barges are ganged together, pushed by a tugboat, in an
arrangement called a "unit tow," which carries 22,500 tons of coal.
   While inexpensive, barge transportation is slow-moving, which can
complicate scheduling. Waterway freezeups during winter months can be a
problem, as can drought conditions when they become severe enough to
threaten water levels. The crippling drought in the Midwest in 1990 is a
good example.
   With the anticipated surge in coal traffic--expected to reach more than
180-million tons by the mid-1990s--a need exists now for larger fleets,
bigger-capacity barges, and continued maintenance and construction
improvements on the inland waterway system.

Trucks, overland conveyors
   These modes of transportation are used primarily for coal deliveries to
plants near coal mines, although coal for small industrial boilers are
often supplied by trucks covering greater distances. Overland conveyors
commonly move coal up to 15 miles from mine to plant, or from mine to
storage or transportation facilities. Longer distances are feasible but may
not be economical compared to truck hauls or short-haul rail transport.
Aerial tramways are sometimes used instead of conveyors to cover relatively
short distances.
   Deliveries by truck account for about 13% of the total amount of coal
shipped annually. Three-axle dump trucks hold about 20 tons of coal,
tractor/trailers up to 35 tons. The maximum load a truck can carry on
highways is limited by state regulations. Trucks sometimes see service for
hauling coal on the spot market; that is, when plants are able to buy
relatively small amounts of desirable coal from distant suppliers.
Normally, however, they cannot compete against rail or barge
transportation.

SITE UNLOADING

Once the coal shipment reaches the unloading area at the plant, equipment
tailored for this function comes into play.

Railcar unloading
   Here, the unloading system is designed to accommodate the specific type
of hopper car that delivers the coal: (1) conventional bottom-dump hopper
car with multiple doors, (2) rapid-discharge bottom-dump type where
virtually the entire car bottom is opened for quick unloading, and (3) a
top-dump gondola car that is unloaded by a rotary-car dumper (Figure 3).
   The first design is intended for small users. Designs two and three are
intended for larger coal-fired powerplants that require unit-train
delivery. Unloading with the rapid-discharge bottom-dump type is usually
performed while the train is in motion. When cars pass over the unloading
area (a long underground hopper or an elevated trestle), car doors are
automatically opened and closed. Speed is the advantage here; a 110-car
unit train can be dumped in 40 minutes--an unloading rate of 16,500
tons/hr. This can be attractive for short hauls (less than roughly 500
miles).
   At most utilities, rotary dumping is the preferred unloading method,
mainly because it offers better control of fugitive-dust emissions--always
a problem with low-sulfur coals. Major components of a rotary-car dumper
include the large circular end rings that support the rails on which the
dumper turns, and the platen, which carries the track rail. Each end ring
rotates on a set of trunions consisting of four or eight crane wheels. The
dumper is rotated by a gear reduction drive through a rack-and-pinion
arrangement or a chain. The unloading rate is typically 3500 tons/hr.
   Ironically, when hauling low-sulfur western coals, unloading equipment
is subject to little, if any, redesign. This is because train speeds and
sizes remain essentially the same. A rotary-car dumper, for example,
unloads whatever kind of coal arrives at the unloading area. A larger
shipment of western coal may take a little longer, but dumper retrofit
isn't necessary.

Barge unloading
   Primary types of barge unloaders are: (1) clamshell-bucket type, in
which a bucket is suspended from a set of hoisting cables and opened/closed
by a set of control cables; and (2) the bucket-ladder type, in which a
series of buckets are supported between two strands of roller chain running
in a loop. In the latter, the buckets are filled by being dragged through
the coal in the barge and emptied as they pass over a discharge sprocket
(Figure 4).
   Since significant barging of low-sulfur western coals is not
anticipated, unloading is not affected. Bucket redesign might be necessary
if western coals were to be barged, however, to accommodate the dustier,
subbituminous material. Low-sulfur eastern coals pose no special
challenge.
   Another type of unloader, called the Siwertell screw-type unloader, is
attractive at sites where noise and dust levels can be a problem. Rated at
1000 tons/hr, it consists of three totally enclosed screw conveyors, which
transfer the coal from collier to belt conveyor quietly and dust-free. If
barging of dusty low-sulfur coal increased, this unloader should be
considered.

STOCKOUT, STORAGE

The unloading and stockpiling of coal--both active and reserve--are closely
related, since the continuous unloading operations require the simultaneous
withdrawal and conveying of coal from the unloading point to the plant
storage areas. Conveying rates of coal to storage must correspond with the
maximum unloading rates, so that both operations can be carried out as a
single, continuous process.

Stockout equipment
   Stockout equipment includes a fixed-boom conveyor, radial stacker, or
stacker/reclaimer for, in most cases, stockpiling coal outdoors on the
ground. A fixed-boom conveyor is a stationary inclined conveyor with the
end cantilevered to allow the formation of a conical pile beneath the
conveyor discharge. Similar to this is a radial stacker, except the
conveyor can rotate horizontally in a semicircle to form a kidney-shaped
pile. Linear stackers and stacker/reclaimers (Figure 5) are rail-mounted
machines served by a conveyor that feeds coal to the machine (stockout) or
traveling tripper that delivers coal to the machine (reclaim).

Storage piles
   Active coal storage is the reclaiming of coal for combustion that has
been stored for a relatively short period of time, usually one week or less
(Figure 6). Coal from an active pile is normally reclaimed without
resorting to mobile equipment. The amount of coal stored in an active
coal-storage pile is usually a three-day supply at maximum burn rate.
   Reserve storage is a long-term storage pile for supplying coal to the
powerplant on an emergency basis in the event of an interruption of coal
shipments. Capacity of the reserve pile is a minimum 60-day supply at 75%
of the maximum burn rate. Coal in the reserve pile is compacted. Because of
its dusty qualities, low-sulfur coal requires special treatment in both
active and reserve storage. It must be wetted down or sprayed with
chemicals to prevent undue losses from fugitive-dust emissions. Also, FCAs
have been formulated for stockpiled coal applications.

Enclosed storage
   Enclosed storage of the active pile includes silos and storage barns.
The storage silo encloses a vertical concrete-cylinder coal-pile
configuration usually 70 ft in diameter (Figure 6). The pile is formed
within the silo by means of an overhead conveyor discharging at the center
of the silo. Reclaiming is via a belt conveyor--normally loaded by
vibrating feeders--at the silo's bottom.
   An inverted-V-shaped storage barn encloses a long, straight coal pile.
The pile is formed within the barn by means of an overhead conveyor with a
traveling tripper or a reversible shuttle conveyor. A belt conveyor in a
concrete tunnel below the coal pile does the reclaiming. It emerges from
below-ground outside of the storage barn and conveys the reclaimed coal to
the desired location.
   In the foregoing stackout/storage activities, handling of low-sulfur
coal will require some equipment redesign. Equipment must be larger to
handle the larger quantities of low-sulfur coal, and must also be speeded
up.

COAL RECLAIMING

In general, coal reclaiming systems may be classified as either below- or
above- grade, depending on whether the coal is removed from the bottom or
top of the storage pile. The tunnel conveyor is the principal form of
below-grade reclaiming and is paired with a variety of feed
systems--vibrating feeders, pile discharges, rotary-plow feeders, and
mobile equipment.
   Above-grade reclaiming systems include the bucket-wheel
stacker/reclaimer and bridge-mounted bucket-wheel reclaimers--the latter
used almost exclusively for bed-blending operations. As shown in Figure 5,
the main components of a stacker/reclaimer are the stacking/reclaiming boom
on which is a reversible-belt conveyor, boom counterweight, bucket wheel,
traveling rail-gantry mechanism with track wheels, and the traveling
tripper. The bucket wheel removes coal off an active storage pile and
discharges it onto the boom conveyor belt. It has a series of buckets
arranged around the circumference of the wheel. The buckets are
scoop-shaped with two open faces--one at the leading edge, for digging; the
other where the bucket is attached to the wheel, for discharge to the boom
conveyor.

COAL CRUSHING, STORAGE

In general, the average size of coal received at large powerplants is
3-in. x 0. The size required by pulverizers feeding large pulverized-coal
(p-c) boilers is 1 1/4-in. x 0. Thus, reclaimed coal must be reduced in
size by crushing before it is transported to the unit silos (Figure 7).
   The crusher most commonly selected to reduce 3-in. x 0 coal to 1 1/4-in.
x 0 coal is the ring granulator.It consists of two end plates mounted on
opposite ends of a drive shaft. Smaller shafts are mounted between these
plates around their periphery. On these shafts are small round cutting
rings that perform the crushing or grinding action. This assembly is
mounted in a steel housing, the bottom of which is a curved grate. As they
rotate, the rings force coal through the grates in the bottom. Grate
spacing is adjustable to compensate for wear.

Bunkers, silos
   After crushing, the coal is conveyed directly to the unit to fill the
bunkers or silos. The bunkers are large-capacity, rectangular-shaped bins
with multiple hopper-type outlets. Because coal tends to hang up on the
slopes and hopper valleys of bunkers, cylindrical concrete or steel silos
with conical outlets are an alternative. The capacity of in-plant silos is
usually 8-10 hours at maximum burn rate (all silos in the plant).
   Although bunkers have a greater capacity, a steady gravitation toward
silos at larger powerplants has occurred in recent years. Key reason: Less
potential for fires and explosions, especially for the low-rank coals
frequently selected today. Steeper bottom-discharge angles in the silo
chutes are being specified to make up for the increased use of poor-flowing
low-rank coals.
   Methods to feed coal bunkers or silos include fixed trippers, traveling
trippers, shuttle conveyors, reversible conveyors, and en-mass chain
conveyors. A primary concern for carbon steel silos and bunkers is metal
loss caused by corrosion and wear. Fortunately, carbon steel can be
protected with a gunite lining.

FEEDERS, CONVEYORS

Feeders deliver coal from a storage area to a point where a conveyor can
handle it conveniently for transport. Of the several different types
(apron, bar-flight, vibrating, etc), the gravimetric feeder is the most
sophisticated. It weighs material on a length of belt defined by two fixed
rollers (span) precisely located in the feeder body (Figure 8). A third
roller supports half the weight on the span. As material passes over the
span, the load cell generates a signal proportional to the weight supported
by the center roller. A microprocessor takes samples of the amplified
outputs of each cell. The samples are converted into binary numbers, which
are compared to parameters stored in memory. If the outputs are within
expected range, each is converted into a signal equivalent to weight per
unit of belt length, then added to obtain total weight per unit of belt
length.
   Friable western coals require special consideration in conveyor-system
design (Figure 9). Field experience has shown that the equipment sized to
handle a given quantity of eastern coal will not handle equivalent
quantities of western coal, even though speed adjustments are made to
compensate for the lower density of these fuels. The reason is that the
higher speeds necessary to provide an equivalent heat-rate input to the
boiler may create a significant fugitive-dust problem when conveying
western coals. Speeds in excess of 550 ft/min are not recommended because
of the high shear velocity along the coal's boundary layer, which has a
wind-blown effect on fines. Athough expensive, enclosed conveyors are a
solution.

COAL PREPARATION

In p-c firing, coal preparation consists of reducing the incoming stream of
coal to powder in a pulverizer (Figure 10), so that it will burn more
efficiently. Key pulverizing methods are these, which differ on the basis
of their drying, feeding, and transport characteristics (also see box, p
28):
   --Storage or bin-and-feeder. Coal is pulverized and conveyed by air or
gas to a collector, where the carrying medium is separated and coal is
transferred to a storage bin and then fed to the furnace, as required.
   --Direct-fired. The most common arrangement for new units, coal is
pulverized and transported with air (or air-diluted gas) directly to the
furnace. The hot air used is called primary air (PA), which is a portion of
the combustion air.
   --Semi-direct. Coal is pulverized and transported to a cyclone
separator, then the separated coal is supplied directly to the furnace by
the independent PA system.

Pulverizer types
   Basic principals of particle-size reduction with pulverizers (or mills)
are impact, attrition, and/or crushing; speed classifications are low,
medium, and high. Most commonly used pulverizers are the ball-tube,
ring-roll or ball-race, impact or hammer mill, and attrition types. The
first two types are most often selected for coal preparation in
powerplants, although ball-tube mills are not suitable for intermittent
operation and tend to be noisy, requiring noise attenuation.
   With ring-roll or ball-race mills, two general classes are these: (1)
the roller assembly is driven and the ring is stationary, or (2) the roller
assembly is fixed and the ring rotates. Generally, mills are equipped with
self-contained or integral classifiers to regulate the fineness. Exhausters
or PA fans are used for flow of hot air through the mills.

Recent advances
   A new series of coal mills reportedly reduces maintenance cost and
downtime. Features are an independent removable planetary gearbox,
vane-wheel primary classifier, heavy-duty grinding-roller assembly,
grinding-roller tilt-out mechanism, long-wear-life grinding elements,
spring cartridge assembly, and tall top classifier.
   A promising device for fine grinding of coal is a ball mill that grinds
coal from a nominally 3/16-in. topsize to a 10- to 20-micron size range in
a single stage using coarse grinding media. Key features: vertically
oriented, batch operated, intermediate-energy density, stirred bed. The
mill can lead to more efficient operation; also anticipated: reduced cost
of $29/ton vs $51/ton for conventional grinding under comparable
conditions.
   Coal-mill retrofits based on the principles of two-phase flow instead of
the usual air-only approximation are now possible. A computer model, using
fluid-mechanical calculations and physical interpretations of the
interactions between solid particles and a gas, help to identify a region
in the classifier with unstable flow characteristics and recommend hardware
changes that stabilize it. End result: Improved performance of the
p-c-fired boiler.
   A new, low-cost dry-cleaning process for removing pyrites from coal can
be integrated directly into a p-c powerplant, interfacing with existing
coal bunkers, mills, and burners. It uses a room-temperature, fluidized-bed
particle separator to perform the coal purification process.

What about FBC?
   Several large bubbling and circulating fluidized-bed boilers are
operating at utility powerplants. The need for carefully characterizing and
preparing coal for FBC application has only been recognized in the last few
years. It is not unusual to see sizing specifications of 1/16 in. or less
for low-volatile high-ash coals and coal wastes. High moisture content
aggravates existing prep problems. Top size for highly volatile coals may
still be rather liberal, however. To handle moisture-laden coal, extensive
coal blending is one solution. Fuel dryers can also be considered to
alleviate pluggage and combustor instability problems that result when
wetter-than-anticipated coal is fired.

BLENDING, SWITCHING

Coal blending can be achieved at either the mine or at the utility. At the
mine, it is mainly a matter of mixing higher-quality coals with those less
desirable to produce a blend attractive for purchase. At the utility, the
task is more formidable. Typically, coals are received by train or barge
and stocked in separate piles, by type, using an overhead tripper system. A
coal analyzer is installed downstream of the blending point. Each minute,
the analyzer assesses whether or not the mixture is on target; deviations
can quickly be corrected by making an adjustment in the feed rates from the
various stockpiles. The fuel is then blended by rotary-plow feeders below
each coal pile, which places pre-determined amounts of each type of coal on
the same conveyor belts--layered in a reasonably blended mix. Thus, coals
of various qualities from different mines can be combined for subsequent
combustion in a boiler.

Key advantages
   Blending offers these advantages:
   --Yields a uniform fuel possessing better combustion properties than the
individual coals making up the blend.
   --Allows western coals to be burned in boilers that would otherwise be
unable to fire subbituminous coals efficiently.
   --Either alone or with physical coal cleaning, can be a valuable method
for controlling the mineral content of coal.
   --Most important of all, by combining low- and high-sulfur coals, it
helps powerplants meet the new SO subscript 2 emissions limits.
   Blending is just as much a software as a hardware challenge. Coal
suppliers and powerplants can use commercially available software to select
coal sources for blending purposes, evaluate the effects of blending on
overall product quality, determine the amount of each coal type needed to
meet product specifications (sulfur, ash, heating value, etc), and design
the least-cost blend.

Fuel switching
   Switching from high-sulfur coal to a low-sulfur fuel, such as gas, oil,
or coal, represents a key option when developing a compliance strategy to
meet the new SO subscript 2 emissions limits. Remember, however, large
coal-fired utility boilers in service today have been custom-designed for
selected fuels; changing the fuel may have significant impact on the
operation and reliability of not only the boiler but also many of the
auxiliary systems.
   Assuming that the original fuel source is an eastern or midwestern
high-sulfur bituminous coal, fuel-switching alternatives are these: natural
gas, low-sulfur oil, co-firing (usually with gas), low-sulfur coal (either
western or central Appalachian), coal blending. Since the CAA is quite
flexible in how utilities meet emissions limits, the options for fuel
switching are many and diverse among the units and plants in the utility's
system.

PRECOMBUSTION I&C

Instrumentation and control of coal-fired powerplants is becoming
increasingly critical: Emissions limitations, better heat rates, and life
management have imposed this new challenge (see box, p 18). Plantwide
networks for weighing, sampling, and analyzing coal as it flows from mine
to boiler are an integral part of precombustion I&C.

Plantwide networks
   To move data between field devices and control/monitoring systems
requires a hierarchy like this (Figure 11):
   --Field bus to transmit data from field device to control system and
then transmit commands from control system to final control element.
   --High-speed data highway as a means of communications between control
and monitoring subsystems, and control-room interface with the operator.
   --Plant network to extract information from the data highway and
transmit it to management, operational support, and data-archiving
subsystems.
   --Communications gateways to interface between the plant information
network and systems outside the plant proper, such as the utility's energy-
and environmental-management systems, corporate computer network, etc.

Weighing, sampling
   Coal is weighed between bunker and boiler by a scale or feeder. In
stoker firing, scales are used exclusively; in p-c firing, either may be
selected. Typically, coal scales handle between 10 and 40 tons/hr, while
feeders process up to about 100 tons/hr. The gravimetric feeder (see above)
is among the most accurate weighing mechanisms. Also see the modular belt
scale shown in Figure 12, which is controlled by a microcomputer.
   Of the many types of p-c sampling systems, most provide isokinetic
sampling of the full cross-section of the coal pipe between bunker and
feeder. One vendor offers a portable sampler comprising a manual rotatable
probe with collecting cyclone and control box, making it possible to solve
fireside problems caused by coal imbalance between burners and minimize NO
subscript x emissions--as well as to measure mill performance with
accuracy.

Coal analyzers
   Continuous on-line coal analyzers are broadly classified as moisture
meters, ash meters, and elemental analyzers. All of them subject the coal
to energy from the electromagnetic spectrum, then correlate the response to
measure or to infer the coal's constituents and properties. The instruments
differ in accuracy, energy source used to excite the sample, amount of
material that can be sampled, potential analyzer locations, frequency and
difficulty of calibration, and installation costs.
   Moisture meters incorporate infrared- or microwave-energy excitation and
capacitance- or conductance-based measurement techniques. Commercial
instruments generally rely on microwave attenuation or capacitance
measurement because of their higher accuracy. Moisture meters can generally
be mounted directly onto conveyor belts.
   Ash meters are based on gamma-energy excitation to determine the coal's
mean atomic number (Figure 13). Because ash constituents have much higher
atomic numbers than combustible constituents, determining the coal's mean
atomic number provides an indirect measure of the ash content. Depending on
coal properties and other variables, ash meters may or may not require a
sampling system as opposed to direct mounting on coal transport devices.
   Elemental analyzers have a higher degree of measurement capability. They
measure the content of sulfur, carbon, nitrogen, and many other elements
directly. Also, properties such as calorific value, ash fusion temperature,
and fouling and slagging indices can be inferred from the elemental
composition.
   Prompt gamma neutron activation (PGNA) is the heart of elemental
analysis (Figure 14). Coal passing through a chute is irradiated with
neutrons, which are captured by the various nuclei of the elements
comprising coal. The resulting gamma rays emitted by each nucleus are
unique to that nucleus.
   The rays are transformed into photons at the gamma-ray detector
assembly, then converted into electronic signals and processed to reveal
each element's contribution to the spectrum. Elemental analyzers require a
sampling system.
   Systems available commercially may incorporate one of more or the
instruments mentioned above. For example, an elemental analyzer can be
combined with an ash meter, or ash content can be inferred from the
analysis given by a single elemental analyzer. Slurry analyzers are
available to monitor the composition of coal/water mixtures. Most measure
only ash and solids content, but some under development also are capable of
measuring sulfur and iron content.

Coal quality--and NO subscript x
   Virtually all experts concede that, unlike sulfur, it is impractical to
remove nitrogen from coal. But recent investigations underscore the
influence of coal properties on NO subscript x emissions; more
specifically, how coal properties can be manipulated to reduce NO subscript
x formation. Thus, it is critical that the impact of any coal type or
preparation technique on NO subscript x emissions be thoroughly understood
before a change is made to reduce SO subscript 2 emissions.
   Already, it is clear that today's low-NO subscript x burners require
more precise operation if combustion efficiency, CO emissions, bottom-ash
quality, flame stabilization, and other factors are not to be compromised.
Coal properties are likely to influence operation profoundly.

Under investigation
   In light of the improved I&C required to meet the new emissions and
reporting requirements of the CAA, at least one instrument manufacturer is
seeking to provide some answers. Major elements of its exploratory program
include the application of continuous, real-time coal- and flue-gas
analysis equipment (along with advanced control algorithms run by a
minicomputer) that relate coal characteristics to flue-gas parameters. The
goal is to document how true on-line feedforward and feedback control
schemes can be implemented--showing how precombustion control can
contribute significantly to the lowering of flue-gas emissions from
powerplant stacks.
   To test an on-line continuous coal calorimeter from another
manufacturer, the selected PGNA instrument actually burned the coal and
measured heating value directly. Different bituminous coals were tested
from different mines. Sulfur content inthe coal was calculated by measuring
SO subscript 2 concentration in the exhaust gas. Moisture in the sample was
determined by drying the coal and measuring total moisture (as burned) with
an automatic moisture-measurement device.
   Ash content was measured by X-ray fluorescence while coal was moving on
the belt feeder. An on-board computer controlled calorimeter operation and
calculated all air- and coal-mass flows as well as coal sulfur, moisture,
ash, and heating value.
   Key application: determining the proper mix of high- and low-sulfur
coals in coal yards.

COMING: EXPERT SYSTEMS TO PREDICT IMPACT OF COAL QUALITY ON PLANT
OPERATION

With the continuing sophistication of software, expert systems to relate
coal quality to plant performance are becoming increasingly attractive. For
example, under the US Clean Coal Technology Program, DOE and EPRI are
funding development and demonstration of a computer software
program--called the Coal Quality Expert (CQE)--that will predict the impact
of coal quality on powerplant performance and cost, including emissions
control. Already underway, it's a $17.4-million project.
   Integrating more than 20 computer models into a single workstation, CQE
will predict the effects of a particular coal on each facet of power
generation--from mine to stack. To determine the most cost-effective coal
and the least-expensive system to control emissions for a given plant, it
will evaluate a range of options, including various coals (26 are currently
under investigation), available transportation methods, and alternative
emissions-control strategies.
   The expert system will include cost-estimating models for new and
retrofit coal-cleaning processes, power production equipment, and
emissions-control systems. Individual models will be made available as they
are developed. The first of these models, called the Acid Rain Advisor, is
ready for use; over 70 EPRI members have models.
   When CQE is complete in 1994, users will be able to develop the most
economical emissions-control strategies, identify fuel options based on
overall plant economics, and evaluate alternative powerplant engineering
designs.

MICRONIZED-COAL MILLS YIELD PRODUCT 10 TIMES FINER THAN PULVERIZED COAL

Micronized coal (MC) is normally any coal pulverized to a fineness of 80 to
90% less than 325 mesh (43 microns), with an average particle diameter of
15 to 20 microns. By grinding the coal some 10 times finer than
conventional pulverized coal, the effective particle surface area is
greatly increased. As a result, the combustion chemistry speeds up still
more, leading to a reaction that begins to act like a gas or oil flame.
   Because of this reaction, the MC mill's best application is with
existing oil/gas-fired plants. Modifications are minimal--mostly the
addition of the MC mill, coal-storage/handling and ash-cleanout equipment,
and new controls. Boiler-tube modifications aren't necessary. A recent
advance is the simultaneous micronization of limestone and coal in the same
mill, leading to a significant reduction in SO subscript 2 emissions
   Key mill designs are these:
   --Disc and hammer. The mill houses a vertical shaft, four rotating discs
each supporting impact hammers, and a radial fan. As coal, entering at the
top, descends to each disc level, coal-particle sizing is progressively
reduced. The fan creates a downdraft, discharging the micronized coal at
the bottom.
   --Centrifugal-pneumatic. There comminution sets up a turbulent flow of
large and small, fast and slow particles, which impact on each other,
causing attrition and fine pulverization. A centrifugal classifier assures
coal with an optimal particle-size distribution.
   --Fluid energy. In this mill, a hollow, elongated torus has a lower zone
for grinding, an upper for classifying. Fluid (air or steam) enters the
grinding chamber through nozzles at pressures to 250 psig. As the fluid
expands, it picks up speed, reaching supersonic velocities. Crushed coal
enters the grinding chamber, becomes entrained in the rapidly circulating
turbulent flow, and is pulverized by mutual impaction and attrition. The
classifier passes finer particles, sends larger particles back.

SUPPRESSANTS CONTROL DUST IN ALASKAN MINE

An Alaskan coal mine produces 1.5-million tons/yr of ultra-low-sulfur
subbituminous C coal for domestic and export markets. The coal is crushed
in two steps, and then dropped onto a 660-ft-long enclosed belt conveyor,
which moves it to a 7500-ton storage bin. To operate year-round in severe
conditions, the mine had to be innovative in all aspects of the operation,
including dust control.
   Dust is generated at the crushers, transfer points, and loadout. To
improve dust control at these places, a proven method is the use of
chemical dust suppressants that are either water- or hydrocarbon-based.
Chemicals are added to increase the wettability of the coal and to
agglomerate small airborne particles into larger particles.
   After considerable investigation by mine and vendor personnel, the
product selected had a combination of wetting, foaming, and residual agents
to provide highly effective dust suppression--not only at the treatment
point (just upstream of the primary crusher), but throughout the mine
facility.--Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialists Inc.

ON-LINE COAL ANALYZER INSURES SO SUBSCRIPT 2 COMPLIANCE

Newly mandated emissions standards led Ohio Power Co's Muskingum River
plant to blend coal from an existing AEP-owned mine with low-sulfur coal
purchased from an outside supplier. To blend the coals efficiently, an
on-line analyzer was selected to provide constant readings of the sulfur
level in the mine-supplied coal to the plant, helping the utility to avoid
"overblending" large quantities of low-sulfur coal.
   With the analyzer (photograph), the plant was able to comply with the
new emissions standards by purchasing only 7% low-sulfur coal annually
(percent of total) as opposed to an estimated 30% that would be needed
based on traditional statistical blending methods.--Gamma-Metrics.

BARGE UNLOADER MOVES COAL INLAND IN A HURRY

Company was selected to design/erect a barge-unloading and yard-handling
system for Baltimore Gas & Electric Co's Brandon Shores powerplant, where
run-of-mine coal arrives in open-top barges from transloading facilities in
Norfolk, Va. The 1700-ft-long dock accommodates three barges.
   A pivoting-arm continuous bucket unloader is capable of unloading a
7000-ton barge at the rate of 4000 tons/hr onto the 72-in. collecting
conveyor. This conveyor transports the 2 in. x 0 coal to conveyor No. 2,
sending it over the water and inland to transfer building No. 1, 2100 ft
away. The control-cab operator on the barge unloader can then direct the
stream to either conveyor No. 3, which conveys to the existing Wagner
station stockpile, or to main conveyor No. 4, which terminates at transfer
building No. 2.
   From transfer building No. 2, coal can be directed to the inactive
storage pile, or go on to the bucket-wheel stacker/reclaimer serving two
live storage piles.--Roberts & Schaefer Co.

VALVE ISOLATES BURNER/PULVERIZER LINE

The NFPA code states that every burner line must have at least one
isolating valve between pulverizer and burner for pulverized-coal firing.
At Dayton Power & Light Co's 2400-MW Stuart station, the valve is closed to
isolate the pipe from the furnace during maintenance of a pulverizer or a
leaking coal pipe. A leaking pipe can be repaired while the pulverizer
supplies the furnace with coal through the remaining pipes.
   Called a knife gate valve (photograph), it can withstand the
temperatures associated with burner lines (up to 1700F in some cases). The
tight-fitting valve comes in diameters from 4 to 18 in., and can be
manually operated or fitted with an actuator.--Stock Equipment Co.

FEEDERS PROVIDE CONTINUOUS, DEPENDABLE TRANSFER OF COAL

Vibrating feeders provide continuous and dependable transfer of coal from
storage to generating plant at rates up to 1500 tons/hr (photograph).
Ruggedly designed, many of them have been in service for more than 15
years.
   Coal from the storage facility is delivered via these vibrating feeders
at a fixed rate onto the main conveyor belt and into the powerplant. They
easily fit into existing systems where other types of feeders have failed
to perform.--Renold Inc.

FAMILY OF DUST SUPPRESSANTS BASED ON RESEARCH, TESTING

The Dust-Buster family of dust-suppressant products is the result of
extensive research and field testing under a range of actual conditions.
Products include surfactants, single-application foams for localized dust
suppression, and single-application foams for continued dust suppression
through downstream operations.
   Since each operation for mining and handling of coal is unique in its
methods and requirements, a comprehensive site survey is conducted to
identify problem areas and to determine specific dust-suppression needs.
Then the company considers where suppression is needed most and which
application technique will provide optimum suppression at lowest cost.
   Company provides a full-service program from equipment design,
installation, and service through on-site performance testing. Equipment is
installed during normal shutdown times, thereby eliminating costly delays.

RING HAMMERMILL OFFERS DIVERSE SERVICE

The ring hammermill is primarily a coal crusher, but it is not limited to
such service in powerplants. Its rugged construction makes the hammermill
adaptable to the reduction of coal middlings, lignite, gypsum, soft
limestone, chemicals, and other friable materials.
   To minimize wear and avoid generating excessive fines, the machine is
designed to operate at relatively low rotor speeds. Ring hammers provide
maximum wearing surface and eliminate the necessity of manually turning the
hammers. This feature, along with the adjustable cage, reduces maintenance
cost and ensures control of product size throughout the service life of the
crushing elements.
   The mill is available in sizes ranging from 20 up to 3000 tons/hr or
more, making it suitable for small industrial plants or the largest central
stations. If desired, the machine can be furnished with a built-in bypass,
which requires very little extra floor space, no extra headroom, and
practically no extra initial investment.--Allis Mineral Systems, Grinding

PAIR CRUSHER/DRYER WITH FLUIDIZED-BED COMBUSTORS FOR EFFICIENT FUEL
PREPARATION

At this California powerplant, a crusher/dryer is the heart of what is
reportedly the first fuel-preparation system to be integrated with
fluidized-bed combustors. Hot flue gas at a temperature of 1500 to 1700F is
drawn into the machine, where 23%-moisture fuel is simultaneously crushed
and dried to meet the requirements of Combustion Power Co's circulating
fluidized-bed (CFB) boiler at GWF Power Systems' 20-MW powerplant near
Hanford, Calif (schematic). CFB-boiler requirements are 228,000 parts/hr
fines.
   The system features the ability to produce a dry, free-flowing fuel
using the energy available from the combustors for drying, then
close-looping the exhaust gases back to the boiler with no loss in unit
efficiency, while also eliminating a dedicated fabric filter for the drying
process. Because of the low O2 content of the flue gas, crushing and drying
take place in an inert atmosphere. Equipment meets NFPA 69 and 85F
requirements.--Williams Patent Crusher & Pulverizer Co.

SAMPLING WITHIN BIAS-TEST ACCURACY LIMITS

At Ireland's Moneypoint generating station, Clean Sweep sampling systems
were selected to replace nonfunctioning, three-stage falling-stream
systems. The new systems are guaranteed to perform reliably, handling wet
coal without hangups and providing sampling results within specified
bias-test accuracy limits.
   The automated belt-sampling system has (1) a primary sampler, which
mounts on the conveyor truss or stringers; and (2) a secondary module,
which is at ground level alongside the conveyor. Crushed coal is sampled
from both stopped and moving belts. A "contoured support" assures correct
belt height, which also corrects for sags and valleys.
   At Moneypoint, all Clean Sweep systems are equipped with mechanical
intermediate sampling to recover uncrushed samples without stopping the
primary belt. Also, all systems have crushers capable of single-stage
reduction to 1/8 in. x 0 size. Commissioning was completed in October 1990.
The systems have been successfully bias-tested and in continuous service
since installation.

PULVERIZER UPGRADES BOOST PERFORMANCE

A Midwest utility experienced problems with its six 1975 coal pulverizers.
Mechanical failures led to frequent downtime, resulting in substantial loss
of unit availability. The company made an evaluation and installed six new
mills, one at a time (photograph), allowing the steam generator to remain
on line. Each pulverizer was subassembled into major sections, offering
quick installation. Pulverizerreliability and availability have improved
dramatically, while maintenance costs have plunged.
   In some retrofits, noncompany mills have been upgraded by re-using as
much as 30% of the existing components and installing company internals in
custom-engineered, modified housings. Improved performance, reduced capital
and maintenance costs were the result.--Babcock & Wilcox Co.

MILL EFFICIENTLY GRINDS WET OR DRY COAL FINES

This vertical-type mill can be a continuous or batch-type stirred-media
machine that can efficiently grind wet or dry coal fines. Grinding media
such as steel balls, ceramic or natural pebbles, or other material is
stirred by an overhung double-helix screw (or charge agitator) in an
open-circuit configuration. Material to be ground is fed in at the top
along with mill water. A continuous upward flow of slurry is maintained by
an external recycle pump. Small feed particles rise and large particles
fall to the media charge, where they are drawn into the media for
grinding.
   Media rises within the screw flights and falls downward in the annular
space between the flight tips and the inside diameters of the mill body.
With steel balls as media, typical media depth is 6 to 8 ft. During
operation, the lower portion of the mill body is packed with media except
for a small space directly below the screw flights. Pulp overflows from the
mill body into an integral classifier. The overflow is either product or
feed for subsequent classification. Underflow is recycled.--Allis Mineral
Systems, Grinding Div.

TWO-PASS RO EASES DEMINERALIZER REGENERATION BURDEN
Membrane applications to makeup-water treatment continue to expand. Redesign
of a utility pretreatment system, described here, introduced many
improvements, not least among which was a major reduction in chemical costs

By:
Compiled by Sheldon D Strauss


Ion-exchange (IX) demineralization is a common, effective method used for
supplying makeup water for steam production. As one utility learned,
however, system modification as a result of open-minded analysis can lead
to product improvement and reduction of operating cost.
   The utility is TU Electric, and the case in point is the Stryker Creek
generating station. As described at the recent International Water
Conference, the opportunity for improvement arose when deterioration of the
treatment system reached a point where reliability, maintenance costs, and
availability of replacement parts became a source of major concern. Several
other factors compounded the problem: limited availability and rising cost
of sodium hydroxide, and the impact of IX waste discharges on the
environment. The need for reduced silica input to the station's two
high-pressure boilers was another consideration.(Reference 1)
   These problems were resolved by substituting membrane treatment for the
cation/anion resin-bed combination used to pretreat makeup water for the
station's mixed-bed demineralizer. In almost a year of operation, it has
provided a better influent for polishing, reducing the frequency of
mixed-bed regeneration. Although the product flow is less, this has been
more than compensated for by an increase in the pretreatment duty cycle.
   The treatment system initially consisted of greensand filters,
strong-acid cation and strong-base anionIX units, and a mixed-resin bed; a
degasifier following the cation unit provided for CO subscript 2 removal.
Operating to a 100-micro-S/cm endpoint, the two-bed (cation/anion) section
provided water quality typically in the range 10 to 80 micro-S/cm. The
mixed bed was operated to an endpoint of 1 micro-S/cm or 10 ppb silica,
concentration of the latter ranging from 10 to 20 ppb SiO subscript 2
during service runs.
   Several options, all involving membrane treatment with reverse osmosis
(RO) in various configurations, were proposed when the need for improvement
became apparent. To process raw makeup with 400 mg/L dissolved solids,
several membrane types were considered, including "seawater" polyamide
membranes because of their 99.5% salt-rejection capability.(Reference 2)
Other choices were between single-pass and two-pass RO systems and possible
elimination of the cation/anion-bed combination as opposed to rebedding.
   Compared to a single-pass RO with two new cation/anion trains, a
single-train system with two RO passes offered advantages with respect to
both capital and operating costs; service runs of the mixed bed with a
single-pass seawater RO array, moreover, was not judged to be satisfactory.
The cost premium for using seawater elements in the first pass of a
two-pass unit was not justified, on the basis of salt passage relative to
brackish-water elements.
   These considerations led to the configuration of choice: A two-pass,
single-train RO featuring thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide membranes.
The dominant factor in this decision was the chemical consumption in
operating the original treatment system--over 462,000 lb of sulfuric acid
and 274,000 lb of sodium hydroxide in more than 600 regenerations of the
cation and anion beds each year. Substitution of the membrane units was
projected to reduce IX-bed regenerations by 98% overall.
   The new system retains greensand filtration and degasification in the
pretreatment section. New greensand media is used, and permanganate is
added continuously to reduce the iron content of the feed; sodium bisulfite
is fed downstream to remove residual free permanganate for protection of
the thin membranes from oxidation (Figure 1). Sulfuric acid injection
reduces influent pH to 4.5, converting the initial 130-ppm bicarbonate
alkalinity to CO subscript 2 for reduction (to about 10 ppm) by the
decarbonator. Subsequent pH elevation to 8.3 by caustic addition further
reduces CO subscript 2 pass-through and improves membrane rejection
capability.
   Cartridge filters provide 5-micron filtration of solids, followed by
injection of antiscalant/dispersant for additional protection of the
membrane system. Under a 500-psi pressure differential supplied by a
multistage centifugal pump, makeup flows in sequence to the two passes,
each of which comprises two stages. Each of the membrane pressure vessels
contains six FilmTec Corp (Minneapolis, Minn) type BW30-840 membrane
elements (Figure 2). Because the second-pass reject is of high quality, it
is returned to the first-pass feed stream. First-pass reject is normally
discharged, but held for neutralization if pH is excessive. The membrane
system has averaged 75% recovery.
   The system modification and quality improvement of treated makeup
account for 96% reduction in the cost of chemicals (over $2/1000 gal of
product water), more than offsetting the added cost to operate and maintain
the system membranes, pumps, membranes, filters, etc (about $1.7/1000 gal
to date, and projected at $1.3/1000 gal). Indicative of the water-quality
improvement is the 1.2-micro-S/cm conductivity and 3-ppb silica leakage
(average values) of the two-pass RO vs 30 micro-S and 15 ppb, respectively,
for the two-bed ion exchangers.
   Resulting improvement of the final product has been the reduction of
conductivity from 0.5 to 0.08 micro-S/cm and silica from 5-10 ppb down to
bare detectability. As added benefits, the modification has obviated the
need for new bulk chemical storage tanks, reduced labor costs dramatically,
and has reduced the accident potential inhandling of regenerant.

UTILITIES CONTEND WITH COPPER TO ENHANCE CYCLE RELIABILITY
Remedies for corrosion and fouling include replacement of copper-bearing
components, improvement of condensate polishing procedures, intensive
chemistry monitoring

By:
Sheldon D Strauss, Senior Editor


The advantages of copper for heat transfer in steam generating systems are
indisputable. At the same time, corrosion of copper and copper alloys
present in condensers, feedwater heaters, etc can impact heavily on other
system components. Evidence of the problem in steam and cooling cycles is
described repeatedly in the literature and at technical meetings, and
remedial steps range from eliminating the source to removal of deposit
accumulations.
   Copper-related problems in various forms have been encountered at many
nuclear and fossil-fueled installations. Both reactor coolant and
secondary-cycle water are involved at nuclear stations. In BWR
(boiling-water reactor) plants, copper has impacted on recirc-piping
corrosion control--through interference with hydrogen water chemistry
(HWC)--and on fuel-rod integrity. Crud-induced localized corrosion (CILC)
of fuel rods results from interaction between a tenacious scale (mostly
copper-rich oxide crud) and nodular zirconium oxide deposits formed on
cladding surfaces. Ensuing thermal stresses, cracking of the oxide layer,
and spalling results in formation of pits, which can penetrate the cladding
if not arrested.
   Identified with plants having copper-alloy condenser tubing and using
filter/demineralizers for condensate cleanup, the phenomenon was reported
in 1985 to have affected 12-15% of operating BWRs.(Reference 1) While some
utilities have replaced copper-alloy condenser tubing with titanium or
stainless steel, remedies sought by others--or applied for further
performance improvement--include tightened control over the production of
Zircaloy tubing and control of copper transport to the reactor. Modified
layup and startup procedures and improved water-chemistry monitoring have
been helpful, but the area receiving greatest emphasis has been treatment
of condensate returns for removal of ionic and particulate matter.
   Considerable attention has been given to improving the design and
operation of condensate filter/demineralizers (CFDs), which incorporate
powdered ion-exchange resins for both purposes (as opposed to separate
filters and deep resin beds). Approaches taken have focused on modification
of both precoat septa and CFD vessel designs, and on improvement of the
precoating technique.(Reference 2) The latter includes use of inert fiber
in the precoat mixture, protective cellulose fiber overlays, and
bodyfeeding of precoat mixtures during service runs. These methods have
proven successful for Georgia Power Co at Plant Hatch, Philadelphia
Electric Co (Limerick and Peach Bottom), and others, with reactor-feedwater
copper levels reported in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 ppb together with
lengthened service runs.
   Step precoating, a variant on bodyfeeding, is a procedure applied at
Vermont Yankee because of deteriorating polisher performance at summer
water temperatures. To improve performance, especially for copper removal,
the utility has been using one or more step-precoat operations involving
the addition of powdered resin, fiber, and resin-fiber mixtures to
individual vessels over short periods of time with the vessels in service.
As shown in Figure 1, step precoating after 10 days has been extremely
effective.(Reference 3) On the average, use of this method has reduced
influent copper from about 4 ppb to less than 0.7 ppb, and extended summer
service runs to 20 days.
   A novel variation on this technique makes use of Ionex cation
fiber(Toray Co, Tokyo, Japan), which has excellent crud-removal properties.
Applied together with the standard coating mixture (Ecodex P-202H, Graver
Co, Union, NJ) in a second step precoat, it has been effective in removing
90% of the undissolved copper present in the condensate. Note that other
techniques are being followed for improved copper removal--unprecoated
elements, backflushable filters, and hollow-fiber filtration for
particulate matter, deep-bed vessels for dissolved copper. Limerick station
is in the process of adding the latter to supplement its CDF for two
purposes: protection from condenser inleakage, and copper reduction to 0.5
ppb.(Reference 4)
   At PWR (pressurized-water reactor) plants, corrosion problems are
centered in steam generators and take several forms: pitting under sludge
piles, denting at tube supports, and intergranular-attack/stress-corrosion
cracking (IGA-SCC). Representative of PWR experience is the history at
Northeast Utilities' Millstone Unit 2, where tube denting occurred after
the first year of operation, pitting after six years, and IGA-SCC four to
six years later (1986).
   Copper has been implicated to some degree in each of these problems,
leading to major steps by the utility to eliminate it. These include
replacement of 70/30 copper/nickel (Cu/Ni) tubing in condensers with
titanium, and in feedwater heaters and moisture separator with stainless
steel. The heater-drains cooler, the only copper-bearing component
remaining in service, will be retubed during a scheduled steam-generator
replacement outage in 1992.
   Steps are also being initiated to remove copper that has plated out on
secondary-cycle piping surfaces during the life of the plant. The preferred
approach is elevation of secondary-system pH to at least 9.6 during
operation by increasing ammonia additions. Recirculation of a high-pH
solution (ammonia plus air) during the outage is another possibility, with
the use of a more effective amine (such as di-aminoethane) for copper
dissolution as an alternative.(Reference 5) A similar procedure, described
as an elevated pH rinse, was applied to Consumers Power Co's Palisades
station to remove residual copper from the hotwell and feedwater piping
preparatory to installing new steam generators.(Reference 6)
   Fossil-fueled plants. Recognizing the sensitivity of high-pressure
cycles to copper, industry chemical guidelines limit its content in
feedwater to 2 ppb.(Reference 7) In cycles containing copper-bearing
components or lacking adequate condensate polishing, the degree of
corrosion-product transport and deposition in piping, boilers, and the
afterboiler circuit can be surprising. Attesting to this is recent
experience at Laramie River station, operated by Basin Electric Power
Cooperative.(Reference 8) The cycle is replete with copper--Admiralty brass
and 90/10 Cu/Ni in the condensers and low-pressure (l-p) feedwater heaters,
70/30 Cu/Ni tubing in the high-pressure (h-p) heaters. Affected areas
included the station's 2400-psig boilers, high-pressure turbines and f-w
heaters, pumps, valves, etc.
   Boiler-waterwall leaks that began in 1989 caused particular concern.
Examination of a section cut from a leaker in Unit 3 early in 1990 revealed
a deep pit adjacent to thick copper-colored deposits (Figure 2); analysis
indicated under-deposit caustic gouging. Subsequent visual examination of
Unit 2 revealed tiny copper particles uniformly scattered over almost the
entire surface of every tube inspected--probably typical of all three
units. It was decided to chemically clean Unit 2, and to make several
operational changes to minimize further damage from copper deposits:
increase condensate pH from 8.6-8.7 to 8.8-9.2, blanket h-p heaters with
nitrogen during outages, and shorten run lengths for deep-bed condensate
polishers.
   As a prelude to cleaning, deposit densities were determined by
energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to range from 13 to 28 g/ft superscript 2,
with copper and copper oxides constituting 61 to 80% of the total (and iron
oxide 12-14%). Screening tests indicated thata two-stage cleaning
consisting of ammoniacal oxygen solvent followed by EDTA for iron oxide
removal would effectively clean and passivate tube surfaces.
   Cleaning began by filling the boiler with demineralized water at pH
about 9 to the normal operating level. After the primary superheater was
backfilled through the attemperator sprays, the boiler was heated slowly to
about 150F, with draining to keep the swelled volume from rising above
normal drum level. Water was then drained to make room for the ammonium
hydroxide and ammonium bicarbonate solutions; these were pumped to the
boiler, and circulated through the economizer and boiler. When
concentrations appeared uniform, O subscript 2 gas was injected through the
downcomer drains while circulation (at about 150F) was continued.
   After some eight hours, with dissolution apparently complete, the boiler
was drained hot and rinsed with demineralized water through the superheater
attemperator sprays, overflowing through the drum down to the pump suction
and pumped to waste tanks. The boiler was then refilled with hot demin
water and rinsed until copper and ammonia levels allowed for discharge to
the station ponds. Next, boiler and economizer were filled again with demin
water, heated, the expansion drained, and an EDTA solution circulated with
temperature held at 275F maximum. The solvent was cooled to 150F when iron
dissolution was complete.
   The last stage, passivation and dissolution of residual copper with
gaseous O subscript 2 admitted to the downcomer drains, was completed
within 45 minutes--an important point, because boiler-tube steel can
corrode rapidly in the process.
   An astounding amount of copper was removed from the station economizers
and boilers, ranging from 2616 lb from Unit 2 to 7508 lb from Unit 1.
Inspection after cleaning showed the drums and headers of all units to be
clean and passive. Waterwall tube sections were coated with 3-4 g/ft
superscript 2 of mixed iron oxides, typical of freshly cleaned and
passivated steel surfaces.
   This experience sharpened understanding of earlier episodes involving
plugging of boiler-feedpump screens (1982-84), turbine copper deposits
(first detected in 1983), and pressure losses across h-p heater tubes
(1984-89), all treated by chemical or physical cleaning. With regard to the
h-p turbines, for example, a need for inspection and cleaning was not
indicated until a capacity-loss trend became evident early in 1990. It was
also noted that Unit 2 did not exhibit a capacity loss; that unit had less
steam attemperation, accounting for lack of copper deposits in the
turbine.
   In sum, the evidence indicates that the 70/30 Cu/Ni is de-nickelizing on
both tube and shell sides of the h-p heaters, and that the copper remaining
flakes off. This would explain the presence of copper in the attemperation
water of Units 1 and 3, and in the water of all three boilers, and
identifies the h-p heaters as the problem source.
   This resulted in two operating changes as a short-term fix: Dumping of
h-p heater drains to the condenser on startup until copper levels drop
significantly, and increasing hydrazine injection at the economizer (to 40
ppb) to encourage production of a less volatile copper form (cuprous
oxide), to minimize carryover to the turbine. A decision has already been
made to retube the h-p feedwater heaters. Additional steps initiated
include extensive monitoring for copper throughout the cycle and location
and elimination of all possible points of air ingress. Injection of
hydrazine scavenger into the crossover pipe between intermediate- and
low-pressure turbines is also under consideration.


Figure 1: Step precoating of individual demineralizers between days 10 and
20 produced sharp copper drop in effluent of vessels B, C, D, smaller
reductions for three-year-old vessels A and E. Dotted line indicates
transition

deposit plus caustic gouging

CIRC-WATER PIPING REPLACEMENT: GIVE IT THE ATTENTION IT DEMANDS
When a vital piping system runs out of life, there is a chance to rethink
possibilities, reconsider principles, and even to come up with unique
solutions

By:
Ronald D Vering and John A Bugni, Burns & McDonnell
Edited by W O'Keefe

Circ-water piping between condensers and either cooling tower (CT) or other
heat sink is a lifeline for unit operation. Failures occur in these
large-diameter piping systems, of course, requiring repair. The repairs
usually call for little or no engineering effort. After several failures
and repairs, however, the system may become a candidate for replacement. At
this juncture, the situation justifies extensive study and engineering
work. The result is often a decision for replacement.
   Preparing for the retrofit will present several challenges, comprising
the key engineering questions about the proposed project. Look at these
challenges and then at their influence on an actual retrofit operation at a
utility station:
   --Optimizing the pipeline route. Economics require that you keep
operating-facility disruption to a minimum, and considerations concerning
space for plant operation and future expansion are three factors here.
Changes in the plant or additions to structures and equipment since the
original circ-water piping went in may influence planning, and the vertical
dimension of route is important, as well. Decision may be for an
above-ground or a below-grade installation.
   --Optimizing piping configuration. After route selection, the
configuration or layout of the piping calls for attention. An above-ground
line is quite different from a below-grade one, as one example of the
considerations. The configuration must suit site-specific conditions and
plant-operation philosophy. At this stage, primary objectives may be
reduction in disruption of plant operations and limitation of generation
downtime. Give thought, too, to how much of the retrofit lines the plant
can install without interrupting the existing circ-water lines.
   --Accommodating thermal expansion. Conventional longitudinal expansion
joints and anchors are available. Flexible couplings are also worth
considering.
   --Reducing pipe-support costs. These components of the system allow
thermal movement and relieve beam bending stress in the pipe. They also
must prevent excessive pipe movement. Pipe-support costs can be an
important factor in installation cost for the retrofit system and deserve
engineering attention.
   --Retrofitting with minimal downtime. If generation is not to be lost,
pipe installation needs care. Should an outage for installation be long,
then perhaps the plant can wait for a fairly long outage for other
repairs.

Retrofit follows precepts
   The city of Lakeland's 333-MW McIntosh Unit 3 was equipped with
7-ft-diameter circ-water pipes between condenser and cooling tower. After
several failures had occurred in the below-grade system, the Florida
utility's engineers decided to replace the lines. The study followed the
principles outlined above, and both engineering and installation faced
several unique situations.
   Optimizing the route in this case came down to a choice between two
possibilities. One was a repeat of the original below-grade choice,
following an existing secondary road in the plant. The other was an
above-ground installation through an open space in the plant's 230-kV
switchyard.
   Decision was for the above-ground configuration. Figure 1 pictures the
piping and the switchyard during construction. The decision was a difficult
one. From a plant-operation standpoint, a below-grade installation was
preferable, as even casual study of Figure 2 makes clear. Nevertheless,
going below the surface would call for extensive trench shoring to protect
existing structures and for dewatering, because of a high groundwater
table. In addition, a below-grade installation would have needed trench
depths to 15 ft in some areas to clear existing electrical duct banks.
   Because of the cost impact of these site-related installation
conditions, the above-ground configuration won out. The projected cost
saving of the above-ground over the below-grade installation was about
$3.5-million.
   Pipe-material cost was an important component of total project cost, and
therefore required evaluation during the route-selection process. Concrete,
fiberglass, and steel were the possibilities, judged on a comparable basis
that considered strength, corrosion resistance, and maintenance. Decision
would have been for concrete as most economical for a below-grade
installation. Steel was the choice for the selected above-ground system.
   Running the lines above-ground posed many unique challenges. The
configuration finally chosen, however, allowed installation of most of the
pipeline without upsetting the old circ-water system. The amount of pipe
awaiting installation during a Unit-3 outage finally amounted to only that
for tie-in at the condenser, the circulating-water pumps, and the cooling
tower, plus some pipe under a 69-kV electrical bus and a 230-kV transfer
switch in the switchyard area.
   Figure 2 outlines major considerations affecting piping configuration
and details four of the most critical design areas. It gives the choices of
routes and makes clear the pipe stretches installed during unit outage.
   Maximum access and laydown space in the area between Unit 1 and Unit 3
resulted from the stacked pipe arrangement along the west side of Unit 3
(Figure 3). Jointing of the pipe in this area, by couplings and flanges,
makes possible the dismantlement of the pipe and thereby the accommodation
of future removal of such major equipment as Unit-3 transformers. Eyes
welded at the tops of pipe spools help in this.
   The crossing (Figure 4) under both the existing 230-kV switch structure,
which transfers Unit-3 generated power to the switchyard, and the 69-kV tie
bus connecting the switchyard for Units 1 and 2 to the Unit-3 switchyard,
demanded special consideration. Clearance needs mandated raising of both
structures.
   Pipeline clearance from overhead power lines throughout the plant site,
as well as electrical bus inside the switchyard, was another concern. The
design met fault-current potential considerations by grounding the pipeline
at approximately 40-ft increments, at each pipe joint.
   Reaching the cooling tower required crossing the main plant-entrance
road. Partial burying of the pipes in this area reduced installation costs.
Although setting the bottom of the pipe about 4 ft below existing grade
eliminated need for extensive shoring and dewatering here, the concept made
necessary an adjustment to the existing road's profile to accommodate the
3-ft abovegrade projection of the 7-ft-diameter pipe, plus 30 in. of fill
over the pipes.
   Existing facilities near the road crossing further complicated road
revisions. Nevertheless, the completed change of road grade added minimal
cost without impairing existing facility access.
   At the CT, setting the replacement pipe header outside the existing CT
pipes (Figure 5) allowed installation of the new CT header during operation
of the old pipeline. In addition, maintenance cranes placed either outside
the new CT header or in the alleyway left between the new header and the CT
can remove CT equipment or work on the circ-water pumps.
   Thermal expansion of piping can make longitudinal-expansion elements and
anchors necessary, but these devices would have cost too much for the
McIntosh project. Anchoring the 7-ft above-ground pipe against its possible
470-kip internal-pressure thrust load combined with a possible 150-kip
friction load resulting from pipe movement would have been expensive. The
required route included five bend points, raising costs even higher.
   Part of the solution was to allow the pipe to move near bend points,
which eliminated need for anchors. Pipe geometry still had to be flexible
enough to give the needed thermal-stress relief, however, and there were
several locations where the geometry fell short. Inserting a set of
flexible couplings at pipe joints at these locations gave flexibility at
low cost. The couplings relieve pipe thermal stress by functioning as
hinges that allow point rotation at consecutive pipe joints. Another
purpose for flexible couplings was reduction of loads on connections to
existing equipment and piping.
   Flexible couplings for pipe-stress relief make necessary joint
harness-rod assemblies to transmit the pipe-pressure thrust force across
the couplings. Conventional multi-bolt tie-rod assemblies restrict free
rotation at the coupling, however, so the arrangement of Figure 6, with
only two bolts, one on each side of the plane of joint rotation, was
preferred. There is free hinge rotation at the coupling. The specially
designed ring-girder stiffeners in the figure are necessary to prevent
local pipe buckling in the vicinity of the harness-rod attachment.
   Four regions of interest from the thermal-expansion standpoint are
highlighted in Figure 2. Near the circ-water pumps, a tee branch instead of
a wye gives a better distribution of thermal loads on the pump connections.
At the west end of the cooling tower, an expansion loop in the connection
to the CT blowdown line reduces thermal loads on the blowdown-line
connection.
   Pipe-support costs were a key factor in installation costs. To keep
costs to a minimum, designers chose three types of supports, each intended
to accommodate pipe thermal movement and relieve beam bending stress in the
pipe.
   One type exploited the ring girders already employed at the
flexible-coupling harness assemblies, adding steel-plate support-leg
attachments welded to the girder (Figure 6). Another type, for the vicinity
of pipeline bend points, was a steel saddle welded to the pipe's haunch
area.
   The base plates for both of these support types have slide surfaces with
tetrafluoro-ethylene on both faces to permit pipe movement in all
directions. Guides prevent excessive movement.
   The third type of support, the concrete cradle, is in the straight runs
of pipe, where longitudinal movement is the sole concern.
Graphite-impregnated felt between pipe and concrete cradle eases pipe
movement on the support surface.
   To reduce costs, the pipe-support foundation system received shallow
spread footings except where loads were excessive. Where pipe loads
transmitted large moments into the foundation, pile foundations became
necessary. Only two locations required them: the stacked pipe arrangement
at the condenser and the riser pipes at the cooling tower.
   It was important in the Lakeland replacement project to minimize loss of
generation during pipe installation. The final design configuration allowed
installing most of the pipe while Unit 3 was operating. The estimate of
outage time for tie-in of that pipe was four to six weeks, assuming
double-shift work and separate crews for the condenser, switchyard,
circ-water-pump, and CT areas.
   Tie-in was set for a planned annual unit outage, but the outage duration
had to be extended beyond the normal period to allow the tie-in. For better
maintenance-time utilization during the longer-than-normal outage, Lakeland
scheduled a turbine overhaul to coincide with the tie-in.
   A single crew, working a normal 40-hr work week during a four-month
period, put in the 2220 ft of pipe scheduled for pre-outage installation.
The pipe to be installed during the outage required four weeks, with
double-shift work for the first outage week and then three weeks of single
12-hr shifts.
   During the outage, four separate crews worked in the four areas
mentioned above. Curing the coating on the pipe's field-welded closure
joints and filling and hydrotesting took about a week.
   There were no significant problems during hydrotest and return to
service of the circ-water line. Weld inspection and testing of individual
joints, done during installation of the pipe, contributed to the freedom
from trouble in the hydro test. Minor leakage occurred at one 7-ft and
several 24-in. flexible couplings, but retightening the coupling bolts to
compress the joint gaskets properly stopped the leakage.
   High vibration occurred on one circ-water pump during startup. The new
pump discharge pipe's stiffness differed from that of the old, aggravating
an inherent pump-column/pipe-system resonant frequency condition. Adding
weight to the top of the vertical circ-water pump's motor lowered the
natural frequency and eliminated the high vibration.
   Data obtained after startup indicates that pipe movement is in the
direction and of the magnitude foreseen by the system design. Long-term
reliability can be expected from the replacement system.

LOOK AT SUCTION SPECIFIC SPEED FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
Rework of experience-based limits for impeller performance makes the
concept more helpful in practical pump selection

By:
D H Cavi, Sargent & Lundy
Edited by W O'Keefe

It has been said that engineering is a blend of art and science. Hence,
phrases such as "if it looks right, it probably is" were coined.
Centrifugal-pump hydraulic design is a technology that has typified this
blend of art and science in engineering. In the hydraulic-design process,
the impeller is of primary concern. In addition, the pump's casing is
designed to accommodate the performance requirements and characteristics of
the impeller and therefore has a supporting role in the hydraulic-design
process.
   A well-designed impeller is proportioned to accelerate liquid smoothly
and uniformly from point of entry at the impeller eye, through the vane
passages, and on out to the discharge side of the impeller. If the inlet
eye is disproportionately large, the liquid acceleration may not be smooth
and uniform. In consequence, eddies can form within the impeller and cause
hydraulic instability. In severe cases, the eddies cause cavitation-like
erosion of the impeller and the casing near the impeller eye, along with
harmful pressure pulsations and vibrations.
   Certain centrifugal pumps are designed for low required net positive
suction head (NPSH subscript r). These pumps are in industrial, process,
and powerplant services where specified available net positive suction head
(NPSH subscript a) at the pump suction is relatively low. The impellers in
these pumps, typically identified as "large-eye" impellers, have had the
above-described unstable and damaging characteristics when the pumps
operate at flows away from the best-efficiency flow region on the
performance curve.
   Pump-application guidelines that caution the user on potential
limitations for impeller-inlet and -discharge design interrelations are the
focus here. Previously published guidelines, based on specific speed,
developed head, and suction lift (or suction head), can be simplified and
realigned to conform with current industry parameters of suction specific
speed (S subscript s) and specific speed (N subscript s).
   Early researchers recognized that actual performance of centrifugal
pumps deviated from the theoretical. Main causes of the deviations are
natural and inescapable phenomena--such as fluid friction, turbulence,
pre-rotation, and slip. There were no high-confidence analytical means to
compensate for the effects. Consequently, researchers quantified and
correlated the performance deviations with physical design parameters. The
correlations became a basis for design factors to bridge the gap between
theoretical and actual performance. Parameters such as "specific speed" of
an impeller (N subscript s = rpm x gpm superscript 0.5 divided by H
superscript 0.75, based on conditions at the best-efficiency point, BEP, on
the performance curve--see Reference 1) came into use to facilitate
application of design factors to the variety of impeller types that were
and still are widely used. (Note that H is head in feet of liquid.)
   Impeller specific speed N subscript s is an indication of three factors:
the shape of the flow path through the impeller, whether axial, radial, or
mixed-flow; the design proportions of the impeller at the outer (or
discharge) diameter; and the spacing between the shroud and back disc of
the impeller. Specific speed therefore concerns primarily the configuration
of the discharge side of an impeller. Figure 1 makes clear the correlation
between impeller geometry and specific speed.
   The suction capability of a pump was designated as the maximum "suction
lift" that the pump could produce at a specified flow. When this suction
lift was exceeded, the pump was said to have "lost its prime." In real
terms, the pressure at the eye of the impeller had fallen below the vapor
pressure of the liquid, causing the liquid to flash. The resulting vapor
bubbles choked the liquid flow at the impeller eye, so that the flow surged
or completely stalled.
   "Suction lift" was an adequate means of defining suction capability of
an impeller in situations where vapor pressure of the pumped liquid was
low--such as with ambient-temperature water. The concept is not adequate,
however, when vapor pressure approaches suction pressure. To account for
vapor pressure of the liquid, the concept of "net positive suction head"
(total absolute suction head minus vapor pressure of the liquid, in feet of
liquid) was devised (Reference 1).
   NPSH subscript r characteristic of a pump is determined by test. It is a
function of pump-inlet design, impeller-eye diameter, impeller-vane inlet
geometry, and speed. Researchers have found that conditions at the impeller
discharge also affect NPSH subscript r (Reference 2,3). Some pump
manufacturers clearly indicate in published performance curves that
reduction of impeller diameter can increase NPSH subscript r at a
particular flow condition.
   The Hydraulic Institute recognized that a relationship exists between an
impeller's specific speed which, as discussed above, pertains to the
impeller discharge configuration, and suction conditions. Exceeding certain
limits would increase the potential for serious trouble from "vibration,
noise, and pitting."(Reference 4)
   In 1932, the Hydraulic Institute first published charts for "upper
limits of specific speeds," correlating the specific speed of an impeller
with its developed head and either the maximum suction lift that should be
produced or the minimum suction head needed to avoid serious trouble.
   The Hydraulic Institute Standards had four charts, each for a family of
curves applying to double-suction pumps, single-suction shaft-through-eye
pumps, single-suction overhung impeller pumps, and axial and mixed-flow
pumps. Figures 2 and 3 are those for the first- and last-mentioned types.
The last version was in 1975.(Reference 4) They apply to operation at or
near BEP and base on statistics of the Institute reflecting operating
experience in industrial applications.(Reference 5)
   Of late, the concept of suction specific speed S subscript s has come
into use. An impeller's S subscript s derives from pump test data and
relates flow entering the impeller eye to operating speed and NPSH
subscript r at BEP. In a comparison of different pumps or different
impellers for a particular pump, S subscript s is a useful indication of
relative size of the impeller eye. An impeller with higher S subscript s
would require lower NPSH and would typically have a larger inlet eye than
an impeller with lower S subscript s. S subscript s therefore indicates the
inlet configuration of an impeller in the same sense that N subscript s
indicates the impeller discharge configuration.
   The curves in Figures 2 and 3 are for clear water at 85F and sea level.
This establishes vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure, allowing
conversion of lift or suction-head conditions to equivalent NPSH values.
Vapor pressure of water at 85F is 0.6 psia or 1.4 ft, and atmospheric
pressure is 34 ft of water at sea level. NPSH for conditions in Figures 2
and 3 equals 34 - 1.4 + suction head (or - suction lift).
   Additionally, for any point on the curves, there is an N subscript s
value and a corresponding head value. From these, the quantity: rpm x gpm
superscript 0.5 can be calculated from the specific-speed equation. Lift or
suction head conditions are convertible to NPSH, so S subscript s is
calculable for any curve point by dividing rpm x gpm superscript 0.5 by
NPSH subscript r superscript 0.75. For a double-suction impeller, divide
further by (2) superscript 0.5.
   Figure 4 is an example of the conversion of points in Figure 2 to
equivalents relating S subscript s to N subscript s. The family of curves
in Figure 2 reduces to a single curve for the parameters of N subscript s
and S subscript s. For other types of pumps, Figures 5-7 hold, each plotted
similarly from the Hydraulic Institute charts for the particular pump type.
The equivalent "safe" region that corresponds to the upper limit of N
subscript s on the Hydraulic Institute curves would be the area below the
Figure 4-7 curves.
   Admittedly, some pump designs may exceed the limits in the curves. In
such instances, review of test data and operating experience is advisable
to prove capability for the required duty and range of flow.
   Typically, pumps that exceed the limits have a relatively large impeller
eye (in a multistage pump, the first stage). Experience indicates that such
pumps have a comparatively narrow stable operating range, near the BEP.
Operation outside the stable range can result in liquid recirculation at
the impeller eye (eddies), causing high vibration, pitting on the impeller
and adjacent casing areas, and axial shuttling of the shaft. Prolonged
operation this way can lead to bearing and shaft-seal failure, and damage
to impeller and casing.
   The condition may not be a concern if the pump runs only in the
optimum-efficiency flow range or handles viscous liquids. Pumps below the
curve limits generally have a broader stable operating range.
   Conversely, if a pump's S subscript s vs N subscript s characteristic
falls far below the curves, the impeller eye would be comparatively small,
leading to a choking condition at certain flows. Choking can result in low
efficiency, degraded head, inlet cavitation, and recirculation (eddies) at
the impeller discharge.
   The latest edition of the Hydraulic Institute Standards (Reference 1)
does not include curves such as Figures 2 and 3. Instead, an S subscript s
value of 8500 is assumed satisfactory for most applications. The S
subscript s equation is rearranged to solve for rpm, using NPSH, and the
resulting pump speed is the suggested maximum operating speed. For pumps
with constant-speed motor drive, the next lower synchronous speed would
apply.
   Figures 4-7 indicate that a S subscript s of 8500 would be conservative
for some pumps but needs examination for others. The 8500 value is
questionable for impellers with N subscript s from around 2000 up, except
for end-suction single-inlet pumps, where 8500 would be questionable for N
subscript s of 2500 and up.
   For impellers of higher N subscript s design, Figures 4-7 indicate that
S subscript s is lower than 8500. Figure 1 makes clear that high-N
subscript s impellers have relatively small outer diameters. If S subscript
s is high, then the impeller's inlet-eye diameter is large.
   Combination of high S subscript s and high N subscript s for an impeller
indicates a relatively short flowpath between inlet and discharge, causing
an abrupt acceleration of the liquid and adversely affecting hydraulic
stability of the impeller. The slope of the Figure 4-7 curves agrees with
this analysis. According to the Hydraulic Institute standards committee
(Reference 5), impellers of low N subscript s can be designed for high S
subscript s values; this agrees with the trend of Figures 4-6 curves.
   The Hydraulic Institute curves typified by Figures 2 and 3 stemmed from
field operating experience, and the S subscript s/N subscript s curves of
Figures 4-7 have the same basis, because they were calculated directly from
the Hydraulic Institute curves.

KNOW CAUSES OF, SOLUTIONS TO CFB-BOILER REFRACTORY PROBLEMS
Refractories are used extensively in CFB boilers. Because early systems
were prone to failures, advanced refractory systems have been developed and
applied successfully

By:
M S Crowley, Consultant
Edited by Steven Collins

Circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers use extensive amounts of
refractories to withstand harsh operating conditions--including
temperatures topping 2000F, frequent thermal cycling, and continuous attack
by erosive high-velocity particles. Thermal cycling alone, encountered on a
daily basis by many units, can eventually destroy almost any refractory.
Specific areas requiring protective refractories include the combustor,
cyclones, external heat exchanger (EHE), ducts, and transfer lines (Figure
1).
   Correct selection and installation of materials is critical to
minimizing refractory failures. The following material provides valuable
insights into the construction and repair of CFB refractories.

Typical CFB linings
   Refractory selection is complicated by reciprocal physical properties.
Example: Good insulating materials often have poor erosion resistance. To
make up for trade-offs, refractory systems are often made of several
materials applied in layers.
   Three general types of liner designs are used in advanced CFBs:
Waterwall and thin or thick linings for non-waterwall surfaces. Waterwall
linings, used in the combustor and cyclone areas, use short studs to hold
a thin, 1/2-2-in.-thick layer of dense refractory to the flue-gas side of
boiler tube assemblies. Conventional insulation is affixed outside to
maintain high water/steam temperatures. The linings withstand rapid
thermal upsets better than thick lining. Steel fiber is often added to
waterwall liners for toughness and shock resistance.
   Thin linings, typically 6 in. or less in total thickness and usually
have both dense and insulating layers. They are more economical to install
and maintain than thick linings. However, a hotter shell--ranging from 300
to 500F--can make thin-lined components less efficient and uncomfortable to
work around.
   Thick linings usually consist of two or three layers totaling 12-18 in.
A dense, "hot face'' of abrasion-resistant brick, plastic, or castable
protects against the erosive action of hot, high-velocity particles. Backup
layers of insulating material reduce heat loss, decrease shell
temperatures, and improve overall efficiency.

Refractory materials
   Refractories consist of mineral combinations--usually oxides--formed
into rigid shapes with the aid of a binder. They are classified as either
preformed or unformed. Preformed refractory materials--brick and tile--are
fired before installation. Unformed materials--castables and plastics--are
fired after installation to create seamless monoliths. Castables differ
from putty-like plastics in that they must be mixed with water at the work
site.
   Physical properties. To obtain desired physical properties--such as
strength, erosion resistance, and volume stability--refractory
manufacturers blend the appropriate prefired aggregates with suitable
binders. The latter includes raw clay, calcium aluminate cements, or
phosphate-based materials. The important physical properties of brick,
tile, plastic, and castable refractories differ, depending on chemical
composition and manufacturing and installation techniques used (see table).
Thermal stability, a measure of how well a material resists repeated
thermal cycling, is perhaps the most important property for CFB
applications. However, erosion-resistance, hot-strength, creep-resistance,
heat-transfer, and shrinkage characteristics must also be considered for a
given application.
   Clay binders are often added to ceramic oxides before firing when making
brick or tile. With some materials, a ceramic bond can be formed without
the help of binder by firing them at a higher temperature. Otherwise a
material that promotes bonding such as monoaluminum phosphate, may be used
to form a strong bond after firing temperatures reach 1000F.
   Because they are easy to apply and shape, monolithic refractories--both
castables and plastics--are most commonly used. Castables are composed of
calcined mineral aggregates and a calcium-aluminate or hydraulic cement,
along with additives that ease wetting and placement.
   Castables are shipped dry to the site. Water is added in a mixer if the
material is to be cast in a form, or at the gun nozzle if "gunning'' is
used to place the lining (Figure 2). Advanced castables are becoming more
popular because they offer minimal shrinkage and enhanced formability.
   Plastics are similar to castables in formulation. Both use calcined
aggregates and a binder. However, plastics--which are premixed at the
factory--use phosphates or other heat-setting agents to cause the material
to bond or "setup'' when fired. Castables use hydraulic cements which form
the permanent bond when mixed with water and fired.
   Fibers. Stainless steel fibers and organic "burn-out'' fibers are often
added to both plastics and castables. Stainless steel fibers improve
toughness and crack resistance. Organic fibers, which are finer than sewing
thread, melt or burn-out the first time a refractory is fired, leaving a
maze of tiny tunnels behind. These allow steam to escape and reduce the
occurrence of explosive spalling--particularly during the initial firing of
moisture-laden materials. Virtually no detrimental changes in physical
properties result from adding organic fiber.
   The use of ceramic fiber by itself as a refractory material is generally
limited to packing around metal components such as door jams to allow for
thermal expansion. The erosive action of sand, limestone, and ash generally
precludes the use of ceramic fiber in most areas of a CFB boiler.

Installation techniques
   To ensure that a finished castable product comes out as planned, excess
water must be kept to a minimum, manufacturer's curing instructions closely
followed, and anchors correctly positioned. Slow initial drying
periods--where temperaturesare raised at a rate of about 100-deg-F per
hour--are recommended to ensure that a new lining will not explode upon
startup. Anchors should be spaced at intervals equal to two to three times
the thickness of the lining and extend two-thirds to three-quarters of the
way through the refractory.
   A pneumatic rammer is often used to work putty-like plastics and
castables into the desired area (Figure 3). While most plastics are still
installed using rammers, advanced gunning machines are now available that
apply certain plastics by a pneumatic technique that does not require water
addition at the gun nozzle. The new gunning techniques are likely to become
more popular because they are faster, require fewer people to operate, and
allow some of the rebound to be reused rather than thrown away. In
addition, these pneumatically installed materials are said to be stronger,
denser, and longer lasting.
   Vibratory casting, a relatively new placement method, uses vibratory
action to force thick material to flow into forms. Vibratory castables have
special additives which greatly improve flowability, strength, and erosion
resistance without increasing the water content of the mixture. Gunning or
vibratory casting are the installation methods preferred for large areas
while ramming or hand-packing may be acceptable for small or
difficult-to-reach areas.
   Brick and tile are installed with little mortar using a "dip-joint"
technique. The brick is dipped into a pool of gravy-like mortar, then
installed. Only a thin coating of mortar remains on its surface. Joints are
typically 1/16 in. thick or less. This reduces the chances of creep or the
entry of pieces of slag and particulate matter.
   Contractors. The use of third-party inspectors to monitor the
installation and repair of refractories is recommended. Most owners do not
have the necessary in-house expertise to effectively oversee the
installation of advanced refractories. Preliminary testing of both the
materials and the skill-level of installation personnel will go a long way
towards reducing future maintenance costs (Figure 4).
   Refractory testing. When purchasing a refractory, it is important to
request the manufacturer's test results. Most refractory tests are based on
ASTM procedures which can be performed by many independent laboratories
(see Reference 7). Generally, flexural and compressive strengths, thermal
conductivity, erosion and thermal-shock resistance, and thermal expansion
are the main items of concern. Strengths should be measured at expected
operating temperatures to ensure an adequate service life.

Areas of most concern
   The combustion zone in many CFB units reaches temperatures of 1600 to
1800F, is usually oxygen-deficient, and is generally under a slight
positive pressure of 1 to 3 psig. Severe thermal shock and cycling are
common. Combustor temperatures may swing by 1000-deg-F in a few minutes. A
dozen or more startup/shutdown cycles in a week are possible.
   The reducing atmosphere here may call for refractories low in free iron
or iron oxide. Chemically, iron catalyzes the subsequent breakdown of CO
into CO subscript 2 and carbon. This process results in the deposition of
carbon inside refractories, which causes internal expansion and the
gradual destruction of the material.
   In most CFB units, sand, limestone, and ash act as the primary heat
exchange media to combust the coal or other organic matter. If possible,
sand should be removed after startup because it is extremely erosive. Thick
linings, consisting of 3 to 6 in. of dense erosion-resistant castable or
plastic covering a similar thickness of insulating material, frequently
fail by excessive cracking and "pinch-spalling.'' Shrinkage upon drying,
thermal shock, and creep of the hot face under compressive stresses are the
main causes of cracks. Stainless steel fibers help to reduce cracking, but
can not stop it completely. Pinch spalling occurs as bed material becomes
trapped and the lining experiences repeated thermal cycling (Figure 5).
   Phosphate-bonded mullite-based plastics stand up well in combustion-zone
service because of their good volume stability (resistance to thermal
expansion and contraction) in cyclic service and excellent erosion
resistance. These materials can be used to repair defective areas because
the phosphate binder adheres well to existing materials. To ensure that the
patch holds, a minimum of two anchors should be used. Ceramic or cast alloy
anchors are recommended for holding plastic linings exposed to extreme
temperatures. Additional anchors may also be needed to retain the
insulating layer independently.
   In the freeboard area above the combustion zone, silicon carbide (SiC)
tiles have been used to reduce erosion of waterwall tubes. Often, a silicon
carbide mortar is used behind the tile to improve heat transfer to the
tube. The tile is usually held onto the tubes with welded inserts. In
designs where the waterwall tubes extend down to the combustor floor,
linings often include a thin layer of a dense high-thermal-conductivity,
abrasion-resistant plastic or castable.
   Often SiC-based castables are initially specified on studded tubes.
These can be repaired with phosphate-bonded plastics--preferably containing
SiC aggregate for high thermal conductivity. Phosphate-bonded materials are
also recommended if the feedstock or recycle ash is high in alkali content.
Reason: Calcium aluminate cements break down under high-temperature alkali
attack.
   Cyclone inlet and barrel. Combustor roofs and cyclone inlets experience
temperatures of 1000 to 1800F, with occasional excursions above 2000F.
Here, a two-component lining of insulating material covered by a dense
abrasion-resistant layer containing stainless steel fiber has provided
acceptable service life. If severe thermal shock causes excessive cracking,
a fused silica-based castable may be used instead.
   The cyclone barrel and cone experience very severe conditions, including
temperature swings of 1000 deg F within a few minutes, repeated cycling,
and some erosion. For many thick linings, the repeated thermal shock and
cycling coupled with erosion and pinch-spalling have caused large sections
to fail. Poor results with various repair schemes have led some operators
to replace thick castable linings with brick ones made of insulating brick
or block covered with abrasion-resistant mullite brick. Repairs to these
linings can be made with phosphate-bonded plastic.
   Another possibility is to use a thinner lining made from material with a
low coefficient of thermal expansion--such as a fused silica castable.
However, most fused silica castables have low erosion resistance compared
to phosphate-bonded mullite plastics. Thus, service life is shorter.
   The cyclone cone experiences conditions similar to those of the barrel.
However, here the lining rests on the shell. Vibratory casting is
recommended for strength, erosion resistance, and low thermal expansion of
castables placed in the cone.
   Cyclone dipleg and loop seal. This area has been a source of continuing
problems in some units. Thermal shock coupled with severe erosion and
thermal cycling have resulted in repeated failures. Many of the initial
designs employed thick layers of both dense and insulating
castables--difficult materials to install properly, given the area's
confined spaces and limited accessibility. When installing linings,
insulating castable covered by vibration-cast, shock/abrasion-resistant
castable with both stainless-steel and burn-out fibers should be
considered. Erosion-resistant brick with a backup layer of insulating brick
or castable has also worked well. Phosphate-bonded plastic with stainless
steel fibers is typically used to repair existing units.
   External heat exchangers (EHE), used in some CFB designs, often employ
refractory-covered internal division walls to force ash to flow in a
pattern of hair-pin turns over a bed of heat-transfer tubes. Unlike
external walls, division walls are heated on both sides and are not
fastened to a cool shell. Lack of a supporting shell with anchors means the
wall can bend in and out of its original plane under the influence of
thermal stresses. This out-of-plane movement allows large cracks to open up
and trap circulating bed media, which aggravates the bending action (Figure
6).
   Transfer lines. The insides of transfer lines are covered with
refractories that resist erosion and thermal cycling. The most popular
choice consists of vibration-cast material having excellent volume
stability and erosion resistance. Adding stainless steel and organic fibers
is advisable. Phosphate-bonded plastics, preferably with mullite-based
aggregate for volume stability, can be considered for repairs.

Failures and repairs
   Cracks wider than 1/16 in. can trap limestone and ash particles and
eventually cause a lining failure as thermal cycling induces a wedging
action. The loss of thin layers--down to the anchor tips--can often be
tolerated if the lining is not separating from the shell. Fused
silica-based castables and phosphate-bonded plastics are popular
crack-repair materials.
   Spalling. There are two forms of spalling that are likely to occur in
CFB linings. Explosive spalling usually occurs on the initial heat-up of a
new installation when the water present in the castable or plastic is
converted to steam faster than it can escape from the lining. The buildup
of steam pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the material, at which
point the lining explodes. Organic burn-out fibers used in both castables
and plastics can greatly reduce the chance of explosive spalling. Brick
linings are usually not subject to this failure because the bricks are
prefired and moisture in mortar can escape out the joints between adjacent
bricks. Thermal-shock spalling can occur in both brick and monolithic
linings when sudden changes in temperature force the lining to expand or
contract faster than the material can accommodate the stress.
   Repair methods for spalled areas vary. Brick linings should be replaced
with more spall-resistant brick if large areas fail. Small areas can be
repaired using a phosphate-bonded plastic if an adequate number of anchors
can be installed. Monolithic linings are repaired using either
phosphate-bonded plastics--for small areas--or low-thermal-expansion
castables.
   Erosion. In general, erosion values below 10 cm superscript 3--based on
ASTM test C-704--are required for severe erosion service. A better test
runs at operating temperatures using the actual abrading media (Reference
4). Equipment for this test is not yet widely available.
   The best materials for erosion resistance are the new vibration-cast,
low-moisture castables and phosphate-bonded plastics. The erosion value
varies, depending on the material, the placement method, and the percent
water used.
   Anchor failures can be caused by several factors (Figure 7). Faulty
welding, incorrect spacing, poor anchor selection, corrosion, and
overheating are the most common causes. Ceramic and cast alloy anchors are
recommended for plastic linings because of their superior holding power and
resistance to high temperatures. Stainless steel anchors are used for
castable linings because they cost less and have excellent holding power
when properly designed. Welding specifications should be carefully reviewed
to avoid premature failure.
   Ceramic anchors usually extend all the way to the hot face while metal
anchors are held back at least an inch from the hot face. Thus, if an inch
or more of metal anchor is exposed because of erosion or spalling, an
estimate of the amount of lining left can be made. A decision on whether or
not to reline is then made based on the desired run time until the next
major shutdown.

STOKERS KEEP PACE WITH MODERN COMBUSTION
Often-subtle design and operating details ensure maximum performance from
spreader stokers firing most types of coal and solid waste fuels

By:
Neil H Johnson, Detroit Stoker Co
Edited by Steven Collins

For boilers up to 300,000 lb/hr of steam output, the traveling-grate
spreader stoker remains a viable process for burning coal or waste (Fig 1).
To keep pace with the requirements of modern steam production, improvements
have been made in many areas of the spreader-stoker system-- including
control of fuel and air flow, and emissions reduction.
   Fuel types. The spreader-stoker-fired boiler can burn a wide range of
coals, regardless of their free-swelling characteristics or Hardgrove
index. In general, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite all can be
burned in a given unit to generate similar heat-release rates. Unlike other
boiler types, the requirements of the furnace and gas path, not the
fuel-feed systems, are the main concerns when contemplating a fuel switch.
However, the volatile-matter content of any fuel burned in a spreader
stoker should be above 20% on a dry, basis.
   Theoretically, the coal burned in spreader-stoker-fired boilers should
be sized to include equal proportions of 3/4-in. x 1/2-in., 1/2-in. x
1/4-in., and 1/4-in. x 1/8-in. particles. This ensures even spreading of
the fuel thrown out onto the moving--or vibrating--grate. However, these
sizing recommendations are impractical. To ease the task of sizing coal
correctly, empirical correlations are used. These include: "Distribution of
Sizes of Coal and Recommended Limits of Coal Sizing for Spreader Stokers''
published by American Boiler Manufacturers Assn (ABMA), Arlington, Va.
   In general, coal that is too coarse is more troublesome than coal that
is too fine. Coarse coal requires slower grate speeds and more combustion
air. Many plants are successfully burning coals finer than those specified
by the ABMA curve. However, combustion of fines does create higher levels
of unburned carbon in the flyash, especially as the percentage of
minus-16-mesh coal increases. Higher NO subscript x emissions have also
been linked to excessive fines.
   Spreader-stoker-fired boilers have also been used extensively to burn
many types of waste fuels, including:
   --Wood--from hogged trees to sawdust.
   --Garbage--as refuse-derived fuel (RDF).
   --Bagasse--sugar-cane residue.
   --Industrial wastes--paper, plastics, and wood.
   --Furfural residue.
   --Peanut shells.
   Water-cooled vibrating-grate spreader stokers burning waste fuels are
more reliable and require less maintenance than do traveling-grate units.
   Grate types. The main functions of grates in a spreader-stoker-fired
boiler are to provide a platform on which to burn fuel, to pass combustion
air, and to remove ash. Many different types of grates have been used. But
only the traveling and vibrating grates are able to balance today's
requirements for cost, efficiency, emissions control, availability, and
safety.
   With the traveling grate, fuel is propelled into the furnace towards the
rear wall of the boiler. Some of the fuel is burned in suspension, the
remainder on the grate, which moves towards the fuel-feed end of the
boiler. The speed of the grate is varied according to load. However, speed
also depends on the amount of fuel being burned per square foot of grate
area--an important design value.
   Systems can be designed to produce a heat release rate of up to 750
kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr for most bituminous coals, subbituminous coal, and
lignite. For firing low-volatile bituminous coals, maximum heat release
should be 600 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr to minimize unburned carbon loss.
   The heat-release rate for refuse fuels such as wood or bagasse can
extend up to 1-million Btu/ft superscript 2/hr. Grate speeds must be slower
for RDF to reduce wear associated with the high amount of abrasive
non-combustibles found in this fuel. Therefore, the maximum design heat
release should be limited to 750 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   Design heat release rates for vibrating grate stokers are more
conservative because the vibrating action can over-agitate the fuel and ash
bed, hampering complete combustion. Units burning waste fuels having a
moisture content less than 40% have been designed for release rates up to
250 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr. Coal-burning vibrating-grate units can employ
heat-release rates up to 650 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   Combustion air. Because the goal of the spreader stoker is to achieve
uniform burning over the entire active grate surface, evenly distributing
air flow throughout the grates is necessary. Careful attention must be paid
to the design of the plenum chamber under the grates. Abrupt changes in
flow direction or other hardware configurations which might cause air-flow
imbalances should be avoided. High-resistance grates, which put most of the
resistance to air flow across the grate rather than the ash bed,
significantly improve air distribution.
   Inlet-air temperature can be at ambient or preheated up to 350F when
burning bituminous or subbituminous coals. If moisture content exceeds 25%,
preheated air is recommended. Lignite, for example, requires preheated air,
typically to 400F.
   Virtually all refuse contains more than 25% moisture and requires
preheated combustion air. Air temperature should be limited to 350F for
systems burning RDF because of the varying characteristics of this fuel.
Water-cooled vibrating-grate units burning high-moisture refuse--above
35%--utilize air preheated to 650F.
   Until recently, overfire-air systems for coal-fired spreader stokers
were limited to supplying 15-18% of the overall air. In light of
increasingly restrictive NO subscript x regulations, new systems use three
levels of overfire air--supplying up to 35% of total air input--to achieve
staged combustion. Overfire air must be supplied with sufficient energy to
produce turbulence and thoroughly mix fuel with oxygen to complete
combustion. Nozzle design is the most important factor affecting the
efficient utilization of overfire-air fan energy.
   Flyash reinjection. The two factors controlling efficiency of the
spreader-stoker combustion system are excess air and carbon loss. Units
should be able to operate at 25% excess air or less if air plenums and
nozzles are designed correctly.
   Carbon loss is the sum of carbon lost in flyash and bottom ash. A
well-run and well-designed spreader stoker exhibits a very low bottom-ash
carbon loss. Therefore, efforts to minimize carbon loss concentrate on
flyash. The most popular technique is reinjecting the flyash caught by the
first-stage of ash removal--usually the mechanical dust collector.
   In the case of units burning eastern bituminous coals, the combustible
content of flyash caught in mechanical dust collectors is about 60%.
Properly designed reinjection systems can reduce this value to about 25%.
Reinjection can improve efficiency significantly and reduce the amount of
ash requiring disposal.
   Emissions. Several factors influence the amount of NO subscript x
produced by a spreader stoker, including: (1) amount of excess air, (2)
design heat-release rate, (3) air temperature, (4) fuel size distribution,
(5) method of fuel feed, and (6) furnace temperature. When possible, follow
these suggestions for reducing NO subscript x output:
   --Limit design heat release to 700 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   --Maintain under-grate air temperatures near ambient.
   --Keep coal fines--particles below 0.1-in.--to a minimum.
   --Reduce furnace temperature by staging overfire air or recirculating
flue gas.
   Spreader-stoker-fired systems convert virtually all of the sulfur found
in the fuel to SO subscript 2. Thus, some sort of post-combustion SO
subscript 2-control device is necessary. Both wet and dry scrubbers have
been used successfully. There are also many emerging technologies aimed at
combined SO subscript 2 and NO subscript x control (Power, September 1990,
p 26).

DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING--AN OVERVIEW
Diagnostic engineering is a recognized plant-maintenance function. This
article outlines the use of diagnostic monitoring for detection of
incipient failure, to facilitate predictive maintenance

By:
Otakar Jonas, Jonas Inc
Edited by Sheldon D Strauss

Utilities are in constant pursuit of methods to increase plant availability
in their ongoing effort to improve power generation and reduce operating
costs. A fast-developing approach makes use of diagnostic monitoring of key
plant components and systems as a basis for forecasting incipient failures
and for predictive maintenence. Either continuous on-line or periodic,
diagnostic monitoring includes non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques,
while expert systems, knowledge bases, and other computer-based tools
contribute to forecasting of failures.
   Upwards of 30 monitoring techniques are available for use in detection
of problems having potential impact on the integrity of almost every
component in a nuclear or fossil-fueled powerplant. Established techniques
are based on analysis of stress, crack growth, leakage, vibration,
metallic-particle content of lube oil, temperature change and distribution,
water chemistry, and corrosion. Across-the-board application of this
monitoring technology could enhance plant availability by at least 2%.
Their application to predictive rather than scheduled maintenance can
contribute to reduced forced-outage rates, shortened scheduled outages,
reduced maintenance and operating costs (through damage reduction and
efficiency increases), better record-keeping, and easier licensing.
   The value of the approach lies in its ability to diagnose abnormal
mechanical behavior at an early stage as a focal point for preventive
equipment maintenance. Thus, the information provided can help avoid a
forced outage and makes it possible to perform repairs on a scheduled
basis. It also is used to ensure that the needed parts and tools are at
hand when the equipment is taken out of service. At the same time,
monitoring systems can reduce plant downtime by avoiding unnecessary
component maintenance during a scheduled outage. Still another benefit is
assessment of equipment life.
   Incipient failure detection and predictive maintenance are addressed
periodically by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) at their
periodic "Incipient Failure Detection Conferences." (Refs 1-3 are typical.)
EPRI's Monitoring and Diagnostic Center at Philadelphia Electric Co's
Eddystone station (Philadelphia, Pa) and Non-Destructive Evaluation Center
(Charlotte, N Car) are in the forefront of development of applicable
diagnostic methods. Much can be learned from proceedings and reports
emanating from these and other sources, some of which are referenced
below.4-12 Technical Briefs issued periodically by EPRI are another
particularly useful source.
   Rather than an in-depth review of the subject, this discussion is
limited to a brief overview of practical diagnostic monitoring methods
available to the industry. Diagnostic monitoring involves a range of sensor
types and signal forms covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Depending on the particular component under study, a predictive maintenance
system will usually make use of several of these diagnostic monitoring
systems, grouped according to application.
   Crack, leak detection. (1) Helium and SF subscript 6 are used as tracers
to locate leaks in steam condensers and general air inleakage, in
conjunction with a mass spectrometer. (2) Acoustic monitors (resonant
100-900 kHz transducers) detect minute shock waves generated by cracks,
material and weld defects, rubbing, or plastic deformation; audible- and
ultrasonic-frequency microphones or acoustic-emission transducers detect
energy generated by a leaking fluid; broad-band acoustic sensors mounted on
piping downstream of valves detect noise produced by flow turbulence. (3)
Fatigue monitors are used to calculate fatigue stresses and life from
temperature and pressure transients. (4) Special electrical conductivity
probe measures moisture on vessels and piping.
   Bearing condition. (1) Ultrasonic piezoelectric sensors embedded in
bearings enable detection of wear through measurement of bearing-pad
thickness. (2) Spectrophotometry is used to monitor non-metallic compounds
in oils by infrared absorption; ferrography is a technique for examining
the composition, size distribution, and quantity of metallic particles in
lubricating oil. (3) Oil temperature is monitored in comparison to baseline
temperature as indicative of a problem, but the method may not have
sufficient sensitivity in particular cases.
   Rotating machinery. (1) Vibration signature analysis is used for
monitoring vibration frequencies, amplitudes, and phases; rotor cracks
(including shallow, transverse types) are detected by use of 1st, 2nd, and
3rd harmonics to separate vibration signals from background noise;
rotor-dynamics balance technique uses vibration signature analysis to track
and diagnose rotor/bearing vibration problems; laser doppler vibrometers
can be used to scan rotating surfaces periodically to measure vibration
amplitude and frequency. (2) Rotor/shell stress analysis is used to compute
thermal stresses from steam and metal temperatures to determine fatigue
damage in thick sections of turbines, nozzles, headers, and piping. (3)
Turbine-blade condition monitor uses acoustic techniques to detect blade
cracks, row damage, flutter, and torsional events in turbines. (4)
Surface-layer activation involves implantation of radioisotopes into metal
surface, plus collection and analysis of debris for nuclide content, to
monitor wear and solid-particle erosion; remaining surface radioactivity
can also be monitored continuously for same purpose.
   Electrical-equipment condition. (1) Motor-current analyzers monitor the
frequency spectrum of electric current supplied to electric components. (2)
Thermography is a method for pictorially recording emission of infrared
radiation by hot spots. (3) Radiofrequency analyzers monitor generator
radio waves to detect arcing.
   Water level, induction, chemistry, corrosion. (1) Water level is
monitored in comparison to reference level by various methods including
ultrasound, conductivity probes, and gamma gauges. (2) Water induction and
waterhammer in steam pipes are monitored by gamma gauges, conductivity
probes, and fast-response thermocouples. (3) On-line, in-line pH monitors
track acidity/alkalinity inside components under operating conditions;
variety of specific ion, gas, particle, temperature, and pressure detectors
are used to analyze water and steam composition throughout the cycle, help
determine sources of impurities and corrosion and deposition in components,
with computerized expert systems providing useful adjunct. (4) Corrosion is
tracked by monitoring H subscript 2 concentration in water and steam;
corrosion-current or water-resistance monitors make use of in-line probes
for same purpose; in-line corrosion-potential probe relates corrosion
potential to type of corrosion under way.
   Miscellaneous. (1) Filter malfunction is detected by monitoring leakage
through filters by particle impact and other methods. (2) Flow rate
monitors compare fluid-flow rate to baseline rate. (3) Particle detectors
provide qualitative or quantitaive information on flow of particles and
liquid droplets in steam lines and air and gas systems. (4) Transformer oil
condition is tracked by monitoring H subscript 2 produced by oil
degradation. (5) Valve-stem strain sensors measure force on valve stems.

Steven Collins, Assistant Editor


Gas turbines have long been popular as prime movers for a variety of
gas-compression and power-generation applications. Since the 1950s, they
have been used in remote oil and gas fields, on offshore drilling
platforms, and in gas-pipeline pumping stations. In these locations, where
fresh water is often scarce, premium fuel supplies cheap, or space
requirements limited, compact gas-turbine sets have proved invaluable. And
thanks to its quick-start capabilities--as little as 10 minutes from
startup to full load for large machines and less for smaller
ones--gas-turbine/generator packages also found a niche in the market for
backup- and peaking-power systems.
   More-recent advances, such as increased efficiency and fuel flexibility,
have enabled large gas-turbine-based combined-cycle systems to compete with
conventional powerplants for new base-load generating capacity in many
areas. Gas-turbine-based systems below 100 MW have gained widespread
acceptance for industrial power and cogeneration applications (Fig 1).
   Increased efficiency. Large industrial machines--100 MW and up--are now
breaking the 35% simple-cycle efficiency mark. Natural-gas-fired
combined-cycle facilities based on these gas turbines have net efficiencies
topping 50%. And a recently introduced 40-MW aeroderivative reached a new
milestone--the first commercial gas turbine with a reported simple-cycle
efficiency above 40% (see box, p 64).
   Efficiency of large gas turbines continues to be improved today by
raising turbine-inlet temperatures (TIT). When increasing TIT, it is
necessary to increase the compressor pressure ratio, which is the
compressor-outlet pressure divided by its inlet pressure. The newest large
machines feature TITs as high as 2370F and pressure ratios up to 16:1.
   To withstand these extreme temperatures, advanced gas turbines depend
upon state-of-the-art materials, component designs, and manufacturing
techniques. An improved class of superalloys allows metal components to
operate at temperatures only 600 deg F below their melting point for
thousands of hours--even under severe centrifugal, thermal, and vibratory
stresses.
   Because even superalloys begin to melt once temperatures near 2200F,
internal air-cooling circuits are used to cool components in a turbine's
hot gas path. They draw air from the compressor outlet or interstage
locations to cool the combustor liner, the outer shell of the
combustor-to-turbine transition piece, and the first few stages of moving
blades and stationary nozzles. One manufacturer uses ceramic tiles and
air-cooled heat shields to protect gas-path liners from high temperatures
and related thermal loading.
   Thermal barrier coatings protect combustion liners on new
high-temperature units. These coatings are plasma-sprayed onto the hot side
of the combustion liner in thicknesses up to 0.015 in. For each 0.001 in.
of coating, there is a reported 8- to 16-deg-F drop in the liner's surface
temperature. Finally, a manufacturing process known as directional
solidification is used by select manufacturers to improve the low-cycle
fatigue properties of cast components.
   Low emissions. Several methods are used to reduce gas-turbine NO
subscript x emissions, including: (1) injecting steam or water into the
combustion zone, (2) using dry low-NO subscript x burners, or (3) including
a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in the exhaust train. Dry
burner systems--which reduce NO subscript x production through advanced
control of combustion parameters--have several obvious advantages: (1)
Steam and water injection reduce overall thermal efficiency, and (2)
catalytic reduction entails handling ammonia and disposing of spent
catalysts that contain heavy-metal oxides.
   Two manufacturers reportedly have developed dry burners which can reduce
gas-turbine NO subscript x emissions to below 10 ppm--at 15% excess O
subscript 2--for natural-gas-fired machines (see box, p 63). Machines using
these advanced burners also display near-zero CO emissions and unburned
hydrocarbon levels below 10 ppm when operating at full load. However, CO
emissions may suffer at less than 50% load. One manufacturer estimates
that, compared to a coal-fired plant of similar size, a combined-cycle
powerplant based on these gas turbines outputs 53% less CO subscript 2.
   For units firing distillate fuels, steam or water injection has been
used to cut NO subscript x emissions to 25 ppm. In areas such as California
and Japan, where NO subscript x-control regulations are stringent,
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia injection has been used to
further reduce NO subscript x levels. SO subscript 2 emissions from gas
turbines burning premium fuels are negligible.
   Increased unit outputs. The scale-up of gas turbines has played a major
role in the machine's penetration into the base-load powerplant market.
What may be the world's most powerful gas turbine, a 212-MW machine for
50-Hz service, was chosen by Tokyo Electric Power Co to anchor a 2600-MW,
combined-cycle plant--the largest facility of this type planned to date--to
be constructed in the mid-1990s. The most powerful 60-Hz machine in
operation exceeded its base-load design output of 150 MW in 1990 when it
entered service at Virginia Electric & Power Co's Chesterfield station (Fig
2). The unit is part of a 214-MW, combined-cycle powerplant.
   Coal compatibility. Perhaps the most important advancements
underway--upon which the future confidence of gas-turbine users may
hinge--are those being made in coal combustion technologies (Power special
report, Combined-Cycle Powerplants, June 1990). The most promising of
these, coal gasification (CG) and pressurized fluidized-bed combustion
(PFBC), utilize gas turbines in efficient, environmentally sound,
combined-cycle schemes.
   Commercial-scale coal-gasification/ combined-cycle (CGCC) plants have
been successfully demonstrated in the US. While the installed cost of these
facilities is still significantly higher than that of a natural-gas-fired
combined-cycle plant, the economic viability of CGCCs is sure to increase
if and when the price of natural gas escalates, as many industry observers
believe it will. Developers of CGCC plants have already found niche markets
for their facilities--such as in areas where coal is readily available and
natural gas is not, or as part of utility repowering projects, which
increase overall plant output and efficiency while reducing SO subscript 2
emissions. Several large-scale CGCC plants are now being developed
worldwide.
   The world's first PFBC/combined-cycle facility is currently operating at
the Vartan district-heating facility in Stockholm, Sweden. Main components
include two PFBC modules, two gas turbine/generators, two turbine-exhaust
economizers, and one steam turbine/generator. At full load, the new
facility delivers 135 MW to the electric grid and 225 MWt to the district
heating system at an overall thermal efficiency of close to 90%. The gas
turbine/generators supply about 25% of the electric power output from the
plant, the steam turbine/generator the balance. Parasitic power is 11 MW,
including the power needed to operate the heating circuits's hot-water
pumps. Two similar units are operating-- one in Spain and one at American
Electric Power Service Corp's Tidd station (Power, April 1991, p 103).

ADVANCED BURNERS REDUCE NO SUBSCRIPT X EMISSIONS

Dry low-NO subscript x burners represent an area of gas turbine technology
where significant improvements have been made recently. To illustrate: One
gas-turbine manufacturer guaranteed San Diego Gas & Electric Co (SDG&E)
that NO subscript x emissions from a newly installed 100-MW gas turbine
will not exceed 9 ppm for natural-gas firing--without water/steam injection
or an SCR system. The "hybrid'' burner used on this unit can operate in two
modes--as a conventional diffusion burner or as a low-NO subscript x premix
burner.
   In conventional diffusion burners, fuel and air are mixed and combusted
in the same space. This can lead to poor mixing and cause correspondingly
high thermal-NO subscript x production. With low-NO subscript x burners,
premixing of fuel and air allows combustion to occur with a uniform and
relatively high degree of excess air, promoting lower flame temperatures
and reducing NO subscript x production.
   The hybrid burner represents the current state-of-the-art in dry low-NO
subscript x combustion technology (Fig A). Hybrid burners operate as
diffusion burners in the 0-40% load range, because the premix-burner flames
are too unstable to support combustion at low loads. At 40% of base load,
changeover to the premix burners occurs. In this mode, natural gas is mixed
with the primary air by a series of jets upstream of the burner's diagonal
swirler. Flame stability and low emissions are maintained throughout the
remainder of the load range by: (1) maintaining pilot flames on all burners
between 90 and 100% load, (2) using variable-pitch guide vanes on initial
compressor stages, and (3) using mechanical secondary-air shutters in the
combustion chambers to further reduce primary air flow at lower loads.
   The hybrid arrangement allows all four of the machine's burners to
operate identically throughout the unit's load range. When operating on
distillate fuels, steam or water can be injected through ports in the
burners to maintain NO subscript x levels below 50 ppm. At least two other
manufacturers have recently developed premix burners capable of holding NO
subscript x levels below 25 ppm.
   The main difficulty to overcome with premix burners is achieving a
stable flame, especially during load changes. One design accomplishes this
by using adjacent groups of identical dual-fuel conical premix burners (Fig
B). In this system, the stability of premix burner flames is maintained in
two ways: First, the burner's conical design causes a stabilizing
vortex-breakdown region at the center of the flame. Second, during startup
and low loads, groups of the premix burners are operated in a pilot mode
and act to stabilize adjacent burners.
   Another type of premix burner utilizes staged-combustion techniques to
maintain flame stability and low NO subscript x levels over a machine's
entire load range (Fig C). During startup and low loads, fuel is supplied
only to the burner's first stage, which operates in the diffusion-flame
mode.
   In this mode, combustor metal temperatures limit the amount of heat
released and thus lower the firing temperature and NO subscript x
production. As load continues to increase, a flame is ignited in the second
stage. It is initially a diffusion flame as well--in the lean/lean
mode--but fuel splitting limits flame temperatures and residence times to
control NO subscript x production. At 75% load, all fuel is transferred to
the second stage and the first stage flame extinguishes. Then up to 80% of
the fuel is slowly metered back to the first stage, which acts like a
mixing chamber, with the premix flame residing only in the second stage.
Flame stability is maintained by a small diffusion-flame subpilot in the
second stage.

Figure A: Hybrid burners (above) have been used to drop NO subscript x
emissions below 10 ppm.

Figure B: Dual-fuel low-NO subscript x burner (figure below, left) has no
separation between premix and combustion zones, and is said to be
compatible with both annular and external combustors.

Figure C: Staging of fuel between two combustion regions is another method
of minimizing NO subscript x formation (below right)

AERODERIVATIVE UNITS FEATURE HIGH EFFICIENCY, AIRCRAFT-ENGINE PARTS
COMPATABILITY

The thermal efficiency of one recently introduced 40-MW aeroderivative gas
turbine tops 40%. Approximately 80% of its components are borrowed from an
aircraft engine used in modern wide-body jets. The unit's 14-stage
high-pressure (h-p) compressor, two-stage h-p turbine, five-stage
low-pressure (l-p) turbine, and combustor are identical to those used in
the aircraft engine-- except for minor seal changes and a modification to
the turbine shaft needed for coupling to the generator. Its five-stage l-p
compressor is borrowed from an existing aeroderivative design.
   A variable-inlet guide-vane system modulates air flow during startup,
shutdown, and part-load operation. A variable bleed system is also added to
match air flows between the l-p and h-p compressors during off-load
conditions. The modified rear frame area of the engine provides an
l-p-rotor thrust-balance system, necessary to offset the 60,000 lb of
thrust lost with the elimination of the engine's fan.
   The unit weighs over six tons and is only 14 ft long. For
natural-gas-fired units, NO subscript x emissions are expected to be held
to 25 ppm by using steam injection and 42 ppm by injecting water. For
base-load service, 25,000 hours of operation is expected between
hot-section maintenance outages, and 50,000 hours between overhauls.
   Another manufacturer of aeroderivative gas turbines has developed a
26-MW unit with a simple-cycle thermal efficiency of over 39% (photo). A
popular combined-cycle configuration for this model includes two gas
turbines driving a single generator, an HRSG, and a steam
turbine/generator. For this arrangement, gross plant output is 67 MW and
efficiency tops 50%.
   Major advantages of this aeroderivative engine include:
   -- Gas-turbine changeout requires only eight hours.
   -- Starting time--cold start to power generation--is three minutes.
   -- Auxiliary components are of a modular design.
   -- Site required is small--105 x 130 ft for a 33-MW plant, 140 x 160 ft
for 67 MW.

ICE MAKER ADDS LOW-COST KILOWATTS TO PEAKING UNIT

   The move beyond evaporative coolers to stretch gas-turbine output
(Power, July 1991, p 27) is most recently, and perhaps most vividly,
illustrated by the installation of a large inlet-air chiller at Lincoln
Electric System's (Lincoln, Neb) Rokeby station (Figure 1). Although the
project was completed last September, only one day of testing and shakedown
was possible before the cold, according to officials from Burns &
McDonnell, Kansas City, Mo, the owner's engineer for the project. But for
around $165/kW and no expected increase in operating costs, Rokeby's output
will be increased by up to 22% during hot weather. A 4% reduction in heat
rate is anticipated.
   The objective at Rokeby, like several other recent projects, is to
overcome a fundamental shortcoming of gas-turbine peakers--that power
output is inversely proportional to inlet air temperature. But the Rokeby
project is distinguished by the use of thermal energy storage (TES) instead
of mechanical, absorption, or hybrid chillers integral to the gas
turbine/generator. This way, low-cost, off-peak nuclear- or coal-based
power is used to drive the TES system, not power from the peaking unit.
Rokeby's TES system is believed to be the largest for this type of
application in North America.

Hungry for mass flow
   The gas turbine/generator at Rokeby is an early-vintage MS7001B,
supplied by General Electric Co, Schenectady, NY. Peak rating of the
machine, 65 MW when firing distillate fuel at ISO conditions, deteriorates
to 53 MW at 100F inlet air temperature. An evaporative cooler originally
included with the gas turbine maintained output at 57.8 MW at this
temperature. Although installed in 1975, the gas turbine has operated a
total of only 1500 hours.
   Being a mass-flow machine, the gas turbine's output improves as inlet
air temperature decreases and density increases. Reducing inlet air
temperature to 40F increases output by 11 MW above that obtained with the
evaporative cooler operating. To do this, ice is produced, stored as an
ice/water bath, then used to cool inlet air when the gas turbine operates.

Harvesting ice
   Main components of the Rokeby TES system are a refrigeration unit,
ice/water storage tank, and air cooling coils. A traditional ammonia-based
cycle is employed for refrigeration. It consists of a compressor, three
evaporators, and one evaporative condenser.
   System works this way: Cold water from the bottom of the storage tank is
pumped to the refrigeration unit on top of the tank. The three ice-making
evaporators (Figure 2), spaced symetrically around the top of the tank,
cycle between freezing and shedding. That is, ammonia refrigerant passing
through the evaporator coils allows ice to form on the outside of the
coils, then a hot-gas bypass off the low-pressure refrigerant compressor
passes through the coils, melting the ice which subsequently drops directly
into the storage tank (Figure 3). Ice-making capacity is around 23
tons/hr.
   Gas-turbine inlet air passes through the shell side of a heat exchanger
with chilled water pumped from the ice/water tank through the coils.
Indirect heat transfer was selected over direct contact because it was
thought to provide superior protection of the gas turbine against
impurities in the chilled water.
   Cooling coils are spiral-wound copper tubes with aluminum fins. Design
chilled-water inlet temperature is 34F, design turbine-inlet-air
temperature drop is from 101 to 40F. Maximum allowable pressure drop is
0.5 in. H subscript 2 O. Water that condenses out of the turbine inlet air
is collected and routed to site drainage.
   An inlet air temperature of 40F is considered the lowest safe
temperature for avoiding icing of the compressor. As combustion air is
drawn into the compressor, static air pressure drops because of friction
and increased velocity; a corresponding drop in temperature is experienced
as well. Thus air below 40F could eventually drop below freezing by the
time it reached the first stage of compressor blades.
   Another concern was differential expansion of the compressor rotor and
stator as inlet temperature decreased by 60F. To guard against this, a
five-minute, air cooldown ramp will be used after the engine reaches full
speed. In addition, the cooling system is shut down along a five-minute
ramp.
   The ice/water bath is stored in a cast-in-place concrete tank installed
below grade to take advantage of the insulating effect of the soil and to
provide piping-system drainage in the off-season. Ice is distributed by
gravity and floats like a iceberg until the portion below the waterline
reaches the bottom of the tank. This stabilizes the ice pile and allows it
to accumulate in a cone shape. Rotating water sprays continually
redistribute the ice as the size of the cone increases to prevent build up
under the ice-making evaporators.
   Control of the TES system is based on monitoring the inlet air
temperature to the gas turbine. As it increases, a programmable logic
controller signals two butterfly valves to open proportional to the change
in air temperature. The butterfly valves regulate the flow of chilled water
to the coils. Safeguards were added to ensure that the turbine is protected
against minimum temperatures that could lead to ice ingestion into the
turbine's compressor. Interlocks are also provided for periods of reduced
air flow during startup and shutdown.

Exercising the system
   Rokeby's TES system operates on a weekly cycle. It produces ice for 148
hours and melts ice by cooling turbine inlet air 20 hours a week. Each
weekday, ice typically is produced 20 hours and melted four hours; weekends
are dedicated to ice-making. This cycle meets the requirements of Lincoln's
power pool for peak-capacity accreditation.
   Establishing a weekly cycle, instead of a daily or yearly one, involved
optimization among refrigeration capacity, off-peak power consumption, and
ice-storage capacity. The weekly cycle calls for less refrigeration and
power but more storage. An added benefit of greater storage is more thermal
inertia that helps assure a low water-supply temperature to the coils
throughout the operating cycle.

Machine modifications
   Although not required, Lincoln engineers decided to replace the
turbine's inlet guide vanes with ones capable of passing higher air flow.
This increased the turbine's output by an additional 2 MW or 4% above the
machine's capacity at 100F inlet air temperature. The original evaporative
cooler has been removed.
   Also, as part of the Rokeby retrofit, natural gas was brought to the
site and the machine outfitted for dual-fuel firing. The move allowed the
plant to offset what the state authorities considered an increase in the
absolute NO subscript x emissions that would occur with the TES operating
in conjunction with a distillate-oil-fired gas turbine.
   According to Byron Bakenhus, project engineer, Rokeby is now expected to
be among the lowest-cost producers of peaking power in the Mid-Continent
Power Pool. As such, operating hours for the unit should increase.

DEVELOPMENTS TO WATCH

By:
Jason Makansi


The fortunes of coal-bed methane, like many alternative fuels, seem to rise
and fall in the sea of conventional fuelprices. When trouble erupts in the
oil/gas market--the most recent being the Persian Gulf War--and prices
rise, development of coal-bed methane gets attention. When prices fall,
activity dissipates. In the guise of an environmental liability, however,
coal-bed methane has piqued the interest of some engineers in recent
months.
   Methane has been labeled a greenhouse gas with a potential warming
effect up to 10 times that of CO subscript 2, the most voluminous
greenhouse gas.
CO subscript 2 makes up about half of the so-called atmospheric
greenhouse-gas inventory, methane around 18%. Based on these two
parameters, anyway, methane emissions should be causing more alarm than CO
subscript 2 emissions.
   EPA studies have estimated that more than 10% of the worldwide emissions
of methane are associated with coal mining activities. Traditionally,
methane from coal mines is vented to the atmosphere to protect miners and
property around mines from catastrophic explosions and health hazards.
   Coal-bed methane exists naturally in varying quality levels--ranging
from essentially air with trace quantities of methane to a
high-heating-value product that rivals natural gas. And, it must be
collected and distributed to potential user sites. If not of high-enough
heating value, this proposition becomes uneconomic.
   At least one company, O'Brien Energy & Environmental Systems,
Philadelphia, Pa, is pursuing firm business plans for coal-bed methane that
includes cogeneration at the site or the distribution of the gas to
existing and future cogeneration and small-power sites. In addition to many
landfill-gas-powered generating systems, O'Brien owns several
natural-gas-fired cogeneration facilities ranging up to 100 MW capacity in
Connecticut, New Jersey, Florida, and California.
   The firm's initial foray is a joint venture with Cosap Inc, Dallas, Tex,
to develop 15,000 acres of coal-bed methane reserves in southwestern
Pennsylvania. An estimated 40-billion ft superscript 3 of gas is available
at this site. According to O'Brien officials, when fully developed, this
field could supply one-third of the fuel consumed at the company's two
large New Jersey cogeneration facilities, representing a total of nearly
140 MW.
   Whether by O'Brien or others, extensive development of coal-bed methane
involves some knotty legal and institutional roadblocks. Uncertainties
exist about who owns the rights to methane recovered during coal mining
operations. Also, unsound recovery techniques could lead to groundwater
pollution.

Water/fuel emulsions may be the answer for controlling NO subscript x
emissions from oil-fired gas turbines, especially if the unit is operated
infrequently. Tests at two sites with different machines confirm high NO
subscript x removal levels.
   Process-wise, the technique is similar to conventional water injection
into the combustor. In both, the vaporization of water reduces peak flame
temperature in the combustors, adds mass flow to the turbine, but also
penalizes system heat rate.
   Emulsified residual fuel oil has been proven to control particulate and
NO subscript x emissions from boilers. Nalco Fuel Tech, Naperville, Ill,
and Public Service Electric & Gas Co, Newark, NJ, have extended the
technology to gas turbines firing liquid fuels, such as distillate oil.
   Initial work was conducted at PSE&G's Burlington station on an
early-1970s FT-4 gas turbine supplied by Turbo Power & Marine Systems Inc,
Farmington, Conn. Firing pre-emulsified fuel containing 10-15% water
reduced NO subscript x emissions by 50% or more. Stability of the fuel was
unacceptable, however.
   Further work took place at the Kearny station, also equipped with
early-1970s machines. An emulsification system--consisting of a water pump,
control valve, chemical metering pump, and an in-line emulsifier--was
designed and installed. A proprietary surfactant/stabilizer package is used
to keep fine water droplets well-dispersed in the oil, particularly as it
travels under high temperatures and pressures. The emulsifier system feeds
a single A-4 engine operating as part of a 35-MW Twin-Pak.
   Results were encouraging. Immediate NO subscript x reductions were
obtained when small amounts of water were emulsified into the fuel. When
the water level reached 35%, close to 70% NO subscript x reduction was
measured. Plume opacity disappeared when the emulsion contained between 13
and 17% water.
   These results appeared even more favorable when compared to conventional
water injection rates employed by another utility on a recent-model gas
turbine with hybrid burners. Around 50% more NO subscript x reduction was
accomplished using emulsions with equivalent water-addition rates.
   Tests of the PSE&G gas turbine in a natural-gas/fuel-emulsion co-firing
mode were also revealing. When oil comprised 15% of the total fuel input
and was emulsified with around 85% water, NO subscript x emissions were
reduced by 77% over the baseline value. No problems operating the unit were
documented as a result of using oil/water emulsions nor were any deposits
noted on turbine internals.
   Long-term tests, now underway at Kearny, include 200 to 400 operating
hours on two separate machines firing oil/water emulsions followed by
thorough hot-side inspections. A 1500-hr reliability test is also planned.
Engineers expect to more thoroughly investigate heat-rate penalties, power
output boosts, and changes in CO emissions.
   In Berlin, Germany, one 83.5-MW gas turbine at the Wilmersdorf station,
originally equipped with water injection, was also retrofitted with a
water/oil emulsion system. The plant, owned by Berlin's utility, Bewag, was
operating in cogeneration/district-heating mode but after unification,
authorities determined that peaking would be more appropriate.
   According to engineers close to the project, advantages of using
emulsions instead of straight water injection are: (1) The gas turbine's
combustor is not affected, and (2) emulsions more uniformly distribute the
water in the most critical region of the flame. The gas turbine, supplied
by European Gas Turbine Co, Paris, France, has always fired distillate
oil.
   Of particular interest is that emulsifying agents are not added to the
fuel. Only an in-line static oil/water mixer is installed downstream of the
oil and deionized-water pumps. A residence time of less than 24 seconds
between emulsifying and firing ensures the stability of the mixture.
   NO subscript x emissions achieved are shown in Figure 1. As important,
other operating parameters did not deteriorate, particularly noise,
combustion properties, and CO emissions. Only at loads below the range of
the gas turbine could CO emissions increase above the 100 mg/Nm superscript
3 limit governing the site.
   A long-term test was also successful and helped to evaluate mechanical
modifications required of the fuel supply system and the overall control
scheme. Wilmersdorf now plans to convert all three of its machines to burn
water/fuel emulsions for NO subscript x control.

Direct-contact condensers (DCC) could increase unit availability by up to
3% compared to conventional shell-and-tube condensers, according to D
Bharathan, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colo, and P
D'Errico, Stone & Webster Engineering Corp, Boston, Mass. Other benefits
include a slightly lower heat rate, ease of maintenance, cleaner
heat-transfer surface, shorter condenser height and thus lower plant
profile, better part-load performance, and better control of dissolved O
subscript 2.
   In the proposed system (Figure 2), the DCC is a vacuum vessel with
internal packing that enhances contact between steam from the turbine and
cooling water. Cooling water is essentially condensate that is returned to
the DCC through a pump-around loop. Note that the DCC concept used here is
similar to the one used in dry cooling systems throughout the world. A set
of parallel-plate heat exchangers transfers heat from the condensate to the
cooling-water loop. The plate heat exchangers (PHE) form the barrier
between cooling water and condensate.
   Because there are far fewer joints in a PHE than in a conventional
condenser, the potential for leakage--the number-one problem with
condensers and a significant cause of unit forced outages--is greatly
diminished. Pressure of the condensate side of the PHE is higher than for
the cooling-water side, helping to prevent in-leakage of contaminants into
the condensate. In addition, heat-transfer rates are double, and fouling
factors are at least five times lower than those for surface condensers.
When cleaning is necessary, individual PHE modules can be taken out of
service with no blip in performance.
   Tradeoffs in design include the need for 30% more heat-transfer area
than a surface condenser, need for a pump-around loop which consumes
auxiliary power and increases system complexity, and adequate filtration
and treatment for biofouling of the cooling water stream to prevent
plugging. Cooling-water passages in PHEs are much narrower than in surface
condensers.

Probabilistic modeling is a multi-functional statistical tool made
practical by the advent of high-speed computing power. In the powerplant
arena, it is being used to characterize uncertainties in the performance
and cost of advanced powerplant technologies (Figure 3) and to assess the
fate of toxic substances in existing and new powerplant designs.
   The unique feature of probabilistic modeling is that it expresses
uncertainty in a process parameter or input assumption not as a single
value as with more common deterministic approaches, but as a probability
distribution indicating the likelihood of various outcomes. Interactions
between uncertainties are also better accounted for. It is particularly
suited to analyzing parameters whose values are very likely to be
uncertain. This includes trace quantities of pollutants at or near the
limits of detection.
   The technique allows you to estimate the frequency that a particular
value of interest might be exceeded. So, given specific uncertainties
inherent to the system under study, the model can conclude that there is a
90% probability a given trace substance will not exceed regulated limits.
   In general, the application of probabilistic modeling becomes more
necessary as more parameters become important, even critical to the success
of the design. For example, if the designer is worried about cost, energy
efficiency, reliability, as well as the discharge of a variety of regulated
pollutants, then probabilistic modeling provides a greater degree of
insight into how design tradeoffs affect those performance parameters.
   In the case of comparing two or more plant designs or technologies,
probabilistic modeling allows each design to reflect the degree of
confidence of the designer in his input assumptions. Simultaneous
input-parameter uncertainties are propagated through an engineering model
to yield an explicit indication of the full range of uncertainties in
output values.
   To fine-tune an R&D program, probabilistic modeling allows the most
uncertain components of given design to be identified and quantified. This
allows better placement of priorities and, subsequently, allocation of
research funds.
   One price for this insight is computing time. To illustrate: To compare
two integrated-gasification/combined-cycle (IGCC) plant designs, a
deterministic analysis might take a half-hour or less of computer time. A
probabilistic analysis could take between six and 12 hours. In addition,
the amount of input information required for probabilistic modeling is far
greater. For more information, contact Ed Rubin or Christopher Frey,
Carnegie Mellon University, Center for Energy & Environmental Studies,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

UPGRADE INDUSTRIAL GAS TURBINES WITH ELECTRONIC TRANSMITTERS

Recently, a major manufacturer of industrial gas turbines upgraded the
instrumentation package on its line of machines. Existing mechanical relays
and switches were replaced with modern electronic devices, such as the
pressure transmitters shown in the photos. The older devices monitored
discrete setpoints like pre-start values, plus low, high, and shutdown
levels.
   At the beginning of the upgrade program, the decision was made to
install such analog monitoring devices as sensors, transducers, and
transmitters on the turbines and link them to a programmable logic
controller (PLC). By switching from mechanical relays to electronic
transmitters, the manufacturer gained the ability to closely monitor and
control its equipment, as well as the convenience of replacing two, three,
and sometimes four switches with one analog device.
   With the electronic transmitter, all alarms, shutdowns, and pre-start
cycles are controlled by the PLC. New setpoints require just a few
keystrokes to update the software--not a hardware switch to new relays. The
pressure transmitters provide analog signals for these parameters: fuel
system, lube-oil system, hydraulic (servo) system, turbine-compressor
discharge, boost-compressor suction and discharge, boost-compressor seal
system.
   The upgrade meets user needs to monitor various functions of the turbine
for performance, safety, sequencing, and troubleshooting. The
microprocessor-based PLC works with the new analog input/output modules to
perform such functions as:
-- Sequencing turbine and auxiliaries.
-- Controlling turbine during startup, loading, and shutdown.
-- Protecting turbine from abnormal internal or external conditions.
-- Monitoring and displaying analog and status outputs.
-- Responding to operator commands.
   Among the options the PLC offers are condition and trend monitoring,
predictive trending, comparative strip charts, and turbine and compressor
performance maps.
   With analog components, savings in inventory and spare parts are
possible. To accomplish this, transmitters are calibrated for a specific
range; PLC software is changed for specific setpoints required for the
application. There's no need to stock a wide variety of pressure switches
with different setpoints for different applications and conditions.--Ametek
Inc, PMT Div.

DETECT HOT SPOTS IN AIR HEATERS BEFORE FIRE OCCURS

By:
Steven Collins


The buildup of combustibles on air-heater elements can lead to disaster.
When enough heat and excess air are available, the deposits undergo
spontaneous oxidation--causing the temperature to rise higher. Once it goes
above 400F, ignition can occur, creating a "hot spot." Left alone, such
areas may grow hot enough for the thin metal elements themselves to
ignite--an extremely dangerous situation.
   Ordinarily, thermocouples are placed at the gas-outlet side of air
heaters to detect fires. However, this method only detects a fire after it
has started and may not be accurate when there is little or no flue-gas
flow through the heater--such as when a unit is put into the hot standby
condition--because it relies on the convective transfer of heat to
thermocouples.
   An infrared heat-detection system, recently developed and tested in
Japan, reportedly has several advantages over the conventional method of
air-heater fire detection, including: (1) Hot spots are detected before a
fire starts, (2) element temperature monitoring is accurate at all times,
regardless of gas flow rate, (3) location and temperature of hot spots can
be depicted graphically on control-room CRT screens, and (4) the system can
be calibrated automatically in-place using a standard heat source.
   The system is a joint development of Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Tokyo, Japan. It was tested at Tepco's
265-MW Yokosuka Unit 1, which includes a combination coal/oil-fired boiler
with a rotating regenerative air heater (figure, above).
   To enhance long-term reliability, the system is located in the air-inlet
section of the air heater where temperatures are relatively low and the
environment is free of dust and corrosive elements found in the flue-gas
stream. The actual infrared sensor itself is located outsideof the heater.
   Here's how the system works: A track-mounted mirror travels back and
forth, scanning the plane of the rotating air heater. When a hot spot
occurs, the infrared rays it emits are reflected by the mirror at a 90-deg
angle into the sensing unit. A local control panel converts the infrared
intensity to a scaled temperature signal and measures the position of the
mirror on its track and the air heater in its rotational path. These data
are then transmitted to the plant's main monitoring system, which sounds an
alarm. Operators can view the exact position and intensity of the hot
spot--represented by color spectrum--on a CRT screen. This visual imaging
system makes it easy to monitor growth of the hot spots and the
effectiveness of preventive or extinguishing measures--such as cutting air
flow, flooding with CO subscript 2, etc.
   During 14 months of testing at Yokosuka, the unit is reported to have
operated without any notable problems. In the event that dust deposits in
the area of the mirror--one consequence of co-firing coal and oil--it is
easily removed by a small air-jet system.

CUT SCRUBBER O&M COSTS BY ACID-CLEANING FILTER SCREENS

By:
Steven Collins

Charles Hoop, Columbus Southern Power Co, devised a simple and inexpensive
method for cleaning grit and particles from FGD slurry separator screens at
the Conesville (Ohio) station. In less than four hours, the FGD system's
4-ft-diameter stainless steel screens are returned to "like-new" condition
by soaking them in a trough containing a muriatic acid solution (photos,
preceding page).
   Before the soaking method was implemented, the plant's four screens
required replacement every two weeks at a cost of $400/screen. According to
Hoop, the screens have thus far required no replacement. The 28 cleanings
performed each year require 110 hours, or about $2200 worth of labor.
Replacing the screens cost $11,200/yr plus labor. Thus, the plant saves
about $9000 annually by cleaning screens rather than replacing them.

USE MODEL PLANE TO RECORD STACK CONDITIONS

By:
Steven Collins

While serving as a shift foreman at a utility generating station in
Illinois, C G Vernon came up with a "topflight" solution to recording wind
and temperature data near the outlet of the plant's stacks. Researchers
needed the data to check if emissions were being adequately dispersed and
to substantiate future stack designs.
   Because the stacks are several hundred feet tall, researchers first
considered using a helicopter. However, this alternative was deemed too
risky and expensive. Eventually, the necessary equipment was carried up
above the stacks by large balloons. These were difficult to control. One
broke free of its anchor line and came down in a nearby lake.
   The research team next considered hiring a private plane, but soon found
out that none could fly low enough or slow enough. Just when the team was
about to abandon the project, Vernon--whose son was a model plane
fanatic--suggested that a remote-controlled plane be used. The research
team quickly found a model plane large enough to carry the payload of
monitoring instruments. Soon after, the "mini research plane" was
successfully maneuvered up above the stacks, collected the data, and
returned safely to ground.

CALCULATE LOSSES CAUSED BY STEAM LEAKS

By:
Steven Collins

Did you ever wonder how much energy --and money--is wasted because of steam
leaks at your plant? The next time you come across one, use the following
example to estimate losses:
   Assume that a steam trap having a 1/4-in. orifice leaks 100-psig steam
72 hr/week.
   -- Look up energy loss per thousand hours of leakage in the table
below.
   -- Annual energy loss (AEL)
AEL = 72 x 52 x 240-million Btu divided by 1000 hr = 864-million Btu/yr
  -- Annual dollar loss (ADL)
ADL = 864 divided by (1.03-million Btu divided by 1000 ft superscript 3)
x (0.65) x ($2 divided by 1000 ft superscript 3) = $2581

COOK ZEBRA MUSSELS BY RECIRCULATING COOLING WATER

By:
Steven Collins

By recirculating condenser cooling water, engineers at a Commonwealth
Edison Co fossil-fired plant were able to double the temperature in the
cooling circuit. Six hours of this treatment killed approximately 75% of
the mussels that were blocking the cooling-water filter screens. The
utility estimates that two such treatments each year can prevent zebra
mussels from posing any problems to operations.

FLOW MODIFIER UPS EFFICIENCY OF GAS-FIRED BOILERS

By:
Steven Collins

Users of packaged boilers and other gas-fired process vessels have reported
significant efficiency increases after installing an in-line device that
changes fuel gas flow from laminar to turbulent (figure, above). These
"turbulators" increase gas temperature closer to the point of combustion by
causing fuel particles to impact each other--and the walls of the supply
pipe-- with greater frequency and force. More important, turbulent flow
results in rapid and complete combustion by ensuring better mixing of gas
and air when the fuel reaches the burner.
   One company, Leader Energy Industries Inc, Chicago, Ill, manufactures
stainless steel turbulators, which reportedly have improved the fuel
efficiency of industrial heating boilers by up to 10% (photo, below). The
device has a more dramatic impact when installed in low-pressure gas-supply
systems--below 20 psig--because high-pressure systems inherently impart
turbulent flow. However, improvements have been documented at higher
pressure levels as well.
   When Duncan Boiler Service Inc, Kenner, La, installed a turbulator in
the 120-psig gas supply line of an 800-hp heating boiler, the device raised
full-load efficiency by over 3%. Improved fuel/air mixing allowed smoother
combustion and reduced the required excess O2 by 27%. As a result,
NO subscript x emissions dropped from 58 ppm to 35 ppm.

HOW SHOULD WE PLAN FOR REPAIRS AFTER FIRE OR STORM?

By:
William O'Keefe

A paper mill near our plant recently had a fire on its turbine floor, with
considerable damage done. I was hired by the management to help with the
repair and return to service of the equipment. The mill management, besides
calling in manufacturers of the major components to assess damage and make
repairs, did much of the work on small equipment and piping. Although the
fire was totally unexpected, starting from electrical troubles, it seemed
to me that the plant lost much time at the start of rehabilitation by not
having any idea of how to proceed. There was no coordinated effort or
guidelines on major decisions. Individual tasks were assigned with no more
than a command to get back on line as fast as possible.
   The effort would have been much more efficient if at least the outline
of a plan of action had been in existence beforehand. This would apply to
many other large-scale interruptions, too, such as floods or storms.
   What experience have Power readers had with preparation of contingency
or disaster plans for steam and electric-power facilities? Have the readers
developed any criteria for evaluating damage and repair-vs-scrap
decisions?--OSR, September Power

SOLUTIONS

Documentation is the first need
In a recent fire restoration in which I was involved, proper documentation
was critical to a quick completion. Lack of available, up-to-date
documentation could have been a problem. Unlimited quantities of repair
personnel, equipment, and supplies will do no good until the engineering
staff figures out what has to be done.
   In our case, we had about 80% of the necessary information within one
day. While the equipment covered by the 80% was being repaired, we had time
to conduct a walkdown and to figure out the other 20% that was
undocumented. All those who are in favor of undocumented modifications or
additions based on sketches tucked away in a file cabinet, take heed--the
upfront time and money saved can be lost several times over.
J Dage, Detroit, Mich

Pre-disaster photos can be vital
One help in restoring conditions is a file of photos taken generally
throughout the plant within, say, a year before the catastrophe. The
photography doesn't have to be studio quality, either. A shot taken from a
vantage point and relating the locations of components to each other and to
any piping, electrical ducts, etc, will prove helpful even if drawings are
available. There will always be add-ons that don't show on any drawing.
Some of the added features may have been very expensive in time and money,
and reconstituting them from memory can be costly. Guards and safety
railing are examples of this.
   Two cautions on photographing the plant:
   -- Keep the photos at a distance from the plant site, so that they will
survive.
   -- Make sure that repeat photography is done at least annually, on a set
date if possible.
   With new high-speed film, even a mid-price camera can get adequate shots
in most plant areas without the trouble of special lighting. Record on the
back of each photo the point from which it was taken, so that the next
year's series can at least start from what were found effective vantage
points in the past.
R J Allison, Sacramento, Calif

First, know the inventory
Of primary importance is an equipment and inventory list which includes
purchase price and date, or current price. The list should cover all
capital costs and assets in the powerplant.
   To evaluate damage, an assessment program by category or discipline of
work--such as mechanical, electrical, instruments and controls, or
civil--should include the following:
   -- Scope of damage.
   -- Labor and material estimate for repair.
   -- Labor and material estimate for replacement.
   -- Age of equipment.
   -- Decision on whether system improvement or upgrade is involved.
   -- Availability of replacement machinery or components.
   Remember to assign a unique sequential-number system for each damage
assessment. Once the plant has finished the damage assessment, categorize
as complete loss, partial loss, or no disaster-related loss. This can be a
percent of replacement cost.
   Accurate and prompt damage assessment is critical. It will make easier
the determination of repair vs scrap status and let cleanup work begin.
Damage assessment will prove valuable even for systems or equipment
adjudged to be a total loss.
   A complete schedule for the work is next. It will give organization,
added cost considerations, and a target for completion of work in timely
manner.
   Repair and replacement work can begin with engineering, contractors,
procurement, invoices, work orders, man-hour records, and all
disaster-repair-related cost-tracking referenced to the appropriate
damage-assessment document number. In many cases, an accounting cost code
system may be desirable for an additional method of
cost-accumulation-summary reporting. As costs accrue, up to the final
resolution, the damage assessment evaluation serves for categorizing the
work.
R Webster, Charlotte, NC

It's an established science now
About 20 years ago, "hazard, fault, and failure analysis" turned into a
formal scientific method of investigating potential problems in the space
program, aircraft manufacture, chemical-processing industries, and several
engineering systems. Simply stated, the method applies analytical
procedures to any system or part of it to find the potential for damage of
physical facilities, the downtime costs, and the lost-production charges.
This method has been developed in-house by many companies and various
government agencies. It is usually taught by a practitioner trained by the
employer and having experience in the field.
   Applying the above-described analysis to the paper mill (considering it
as a failure) would have allowed management to have established procedures
for cleanup, repairs, replacements, and general rehabilitation methods in
advance. Obviously this was not done, as OSR observes. The early efforts
after the mill fire seem to have resembled the oldnavy axiom: "When in
danger or doubt, run in circles, scream, and shout." From my experience, it
is possible not only to analyze potentials for catastrophe at various
levels, but also to find ways to reduce the happenings.
   Damage evaluations and repair-vs-scrap decision criteria are on-the-spot
functions, to be made by the best plant- engineering personnel at the
scene. This includes selection of experienced plant millwright crews.

Beware of the asbestos threat
One aspect of the rebuilding effort that doesn't draw much attention but
which is looming larger as time goes on is the problem of asbestos
insulation. Many older plants have buildings, components, and piping
insulated with asbestos-containing materials. Although neglect or even
encapsulation may have led to a false sense of security, when a major
disaster hits, there is likely to be considerable loose asbestos on-site,
already released or to be released during repairs.
   Many environmental agencies are now more aware than ever of the
possibilities of health hazards from asbestos released during natural
disasters of the kind that OSR mentions. the disaster itself is bound to
attract attention of the regulatory agencies, and inspectors are very
likely to be on the scene even before the cleanup crews arrive.
   Any disaster program to restore a plant to service has got to take this
into account. Precautions will be necessary during removal of asbestos to
the point where crews can begin work on the major items of plant and
equipment. Any plant preparing plans for recovery from disaster should be
cognizant of what the asbestos situation is now and could be in case of a
disaster.
G V Arcano, Milwaukee, Wis

Don't rush into restoration
OSR is right in thinking that planning ahead of time is crucial for major
events in a plant. From my experience, I can add that over-hasty return to
service can be the start of a long period of trouble.
   In our case, a flood accompanied by a medium-size fire left us with
water-soaked components,fire damage, and a management that wanted instant
return to generation. We didn't realize the hidden damage from sand, silt,
and water when we rushed through perfunctory cleanups and got back on line
as soon as equipment could operate within temperature and vibration
tolerances.
   After about four months, however, we began to pay the price, with damage
to journals, dielectric failures, gasket leaks, and accelerated corrosion.
I never found out exactly what our accelerated and highly praised recovery
effort cost us, but I am sure that the shortcuts were a disaster of their
own.
R A Masniak, Ft Lauderdale, Fla

Your January problem
What's the best way to plan run time of redundant equipment?

Recently, I have been faced with the question of how to handle the run time
of redundant equipment at a generating station. When planning for maximum
availability at acceptable cost, I have wondered what the recommended
procedure is for trading-off standby equipment. Opinions on the advantages
and disadvantages of maintaining equal total-run time vs either staggered
total-run time or a full-time lead and standby situation seem to vary.
   What experience have Power readers had with improving availability by
careful planning of run time for redundant components--such as pumps, fans,
and even turbines or auxiliary drives? Once a total-run-time policy is
established, to what lengths should we go to track total run time to
equipment preventive-maintenance (PM) times or to failure? Have readers had
trouble with excessive running of standby equipment which may not be as new
or equal in quality to firstline equipment? And what is the best way to
keep records on this?--MPC
