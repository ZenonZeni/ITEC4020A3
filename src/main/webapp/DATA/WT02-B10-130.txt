<P><BR>
<B>Corporate and Business Law.</B> We handle simple and complex business
transactions including: construction contract formation and negotiation,
preparation of agreements for sales of goods and services, sales financing
and secured transactions, and a variety of other related issues.</P>

<P> We also assist our clients in forming business entities including:
partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and partnerships,
and corporations (including those with Subchapter S elections).</P>

<P> <B>Debtor-Creditor and Bankruptcy Law.</B> We represent creditors in
the collection of both secured and unsecured debt, including pre-judgment
and post-judgment procedures such as garnishment and attachment, and real
estate mortgage foreclosures and forfeitures. </P>

<P>We represent the interests of lenders and other creditors in bankruptcy
proceedings and in negotiating debt workout alternatives to bankruptcy.
</P>

<P><B>Employment Law.</B> We provide ongoing advice and counsel to employers
who are addressing a wide variety of personnel matters including: personnel
manuals and other written materials, disability and reasonable accommodation
issue, discrimination issues, wage, hour and benefit issues, and many other
legal issues which bear on the human side of running a business. </P>

<P><B>Land Use and Natural Resource Law.</B> In this area of our legal
practice, we work on issues pertaining to the Federal Endangered Species
Act and are directly involved in the development of the first all-species
habitat conservation plan in the nation. We have been integral in the development
of statewide watershed analysis processes which will eliminate the rigid
uniform rules previously utilized. Our practice involves work on water
quality and quantity issues such as problems with the Federal Clean Water
Act's Section 303(d) listing process. We also work with the cultural concerns
of Native Tribes under the National Historic Preservation Act and other
state laws.</P>

<P>The firm also maintains a busy local and regional land use practice.
We have extensive experience and a successful record in handling land development
issues involving the State Growth Management Act, the State Environmental
Policy Act (SEPA), state shoreline regulations, local zoning and development
ordinances, wetland and sensitive land (critical area) laws, and water
rights.</P>

<P><B>Real Estate and Community Association Law.</B> We prepare documentation
to facilitate real estate purchases and sales, commercial and residential
property leases, easements, covenants, mortgage documentation, and other
forms of agreement relating to real estate practice and development. </P>

<P><B>Condominium Law.</B> We have extensive experience in organizing residential
and commercial condominiums and planned unit developments. We also provide
advice to homeowner and condominium associations on a wide variety of matters.
</P>

<P><B>Commercial Litigation.</B> When problems arise, we represent clients
in all facets of commercial litigation including: trials, administrative
hearings, arbitrations, appeals, and alternative dispute resolution. Our
areas of expertise include: contract litigation, commercial and residential
landlord tenant and unlawful detainer actions, construction litigation
including lien claims and public works disputes, timber trespass claims,
quiet title actions and boundary disputes, business dissolutions and commercial

are becoming more critical every day. Family relationships that change
