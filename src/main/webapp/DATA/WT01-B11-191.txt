The Sand Point First Nation and Ontario Parks have signed an agreement that ensures the operation of Lake Nipigon Provincial Park during the summer of 1996.<P>

"We are very pleased that the Sand Point First Nation has come forward to operate the park this season," said Park Superintendent Darrell O'Neill.

"We look forward to operating the park," said Sand Point First Nation Chief 
Dan McGuire.  "In addition to hiring people from the Band, we also plan to hire people from the local area.  We will ensure that we provide the level of customer service to which the public has become accustomed."<P>
