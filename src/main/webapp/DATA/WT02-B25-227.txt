<h1>What is Mental Illness?</h1>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Mental illness refers to a group of disorders causing severe disturbances in 
thinking, feeling, and relating.  They result in a substantially diminished capacity for coping with 
the ordinary demands of life.  Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age -- children, 
adolescents, adults, and the elderly -- and they can occur in any family.  Several million people in 
the U. S. suffer from a serious, long term mental illness.  The cost to society is high due to lost 
productivity and treatment expense.</P>

<P>Mental illness is not the same as mental retardation.  The mentally retarded have a diminished intellectual capacity usually present since birth.  Those with mental illnesses are usually of normal intelligence although they may have difficulty performing at a normal level due to their illness.</P>

<P>A mental illness is not caused by bad parenting and is not a character weakness or flaw.  These 
illnesses are due to biochemical disturbances in the brain -- they are neurobiological disorders.</P>

<A NAME="Schizophrenia">
</A>
[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]<BR>
<h4>Schizophrenia</h4>
<P>Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and disabling of the mental illnesses.  It affects 
approximately one person in a hundred, men and women about equally. The onset is usually in the late 
teens or early twenties.  People with this brain disorder usually have several of the following 
symptoms:</P>
<ul>
<li>disconnected, confusing language
<li>poor reasoning, memory, judgment
<li>high levels of anxiety
<li>eating and sleeping disorders
<li>hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not externally real)
<li>delusions (persistent false beliefs, contrary to facts or without evidence)
<li>deterioration of appearance and personal hygiene
<li>loss of motivation, poor concentration
<li>tendencies to withdraw from others
</ul>

[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]<BR>
<A NAME="Affective Disorders">
</A>
<h4>Affective Disorders</h4>
<P>Affective disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses. They are also called mood disorders.
Many cases go unrecognized and untreated.  The disorder may be <b>Bipolar</b> (manic depressive) in 
which a person swings between extreme high and low moods, or it may be <b>Unipolar</b> in which a 
person suffers from persistent severe depression.  Without proper medical treatment, such persons 
experience repeated or continuous periods of illness and perhaps hospitalization.  About six percent of  the population suffers from an affective disorder.   These disorders are a major cause of suicide.</P>

<p>
Persons diagnosed as having <b>Bipolar Disorder</b> cycle between manic and depressive phases, and 
usually have several of the following characteristics during a manic phase:
<ul>
   <li>boundless energy, enthusiasm, and need for activity
   <li>decreased need for sleep
   <li>grandiose ideas and poor judgment
   <li>rapid, loud disorganized speech
   <li>short temper and argumentative
   <li>impulsive and erratic behavior
   <li>possible delusional thinking
</ul>
<BR>
<p>
Persons with <b>Unipolar Depression</b>, or the depressive phase of  <b>Bipolar Disorder </b>, may have several 
of the following symptoms:
<ul>
   <li>difficulty in sleeping
   <li>loss of interest in daily activities
   <li>loss of appetite
   <li>feelings of worthlessness, guilt and hopelessness
   <li>feelings of despondence or sadness
   <li>inability to concentrate
   <li>possible psychotic symptoms
   <li>suicidal thoughts or actions
</ul>

<IMG SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><h1>What causes Mental Illness?</h1>
<HR SIZE=4>
<P>The causes of mental illnesses are not as well understood as other physical diseases, 
but research is providing useful information on the functioning of neurotransmitters and brain 
chemistry that is involved.  Heredity may be a factor as it is in diabetes and cancer.  Stress or use 
of "street" drugs may contribute to the onset of an illness in a vulnerable person.</P>
<p>
<STRONG>Mental illnesses are medical diseases of the brain, and are treatable just as 
heart disease or lung disease.</STRONG>
<p>
The shame and fear once associated with cancer has been largely dispelled by accurate information and 
understanding.  The same will happen for brain diseases -- mental illnesses -- once the facts are 
known and shared.</P>

<h1>Can Mental Illness be cured or prevented?</h1>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Since the causes of long term mental illnesses are not known, there is no effective prevention 
nor cure at this time.  More research is needed to determine causes and strategies for prevention.
However, adequate care and proper treatment, including medication, can substantially improve the 
functioning of persons suffering from these disabling illnesses.
