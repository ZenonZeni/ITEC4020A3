name="Ratio Investing 101"><b>Ratio Investing 101</b></a></h1>

<p>Ratio investing is our term for what Dr. Moore called opposite
pairs. This form of investment involves the disciplines of both
market timing and switch investing. </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_961.gif" width="640" height="437"> </p>

<p>The primary consideration when choosing a &#147;pair&#148; is
to find a high negative correlation, <i>i.e.</i> when one goes up
the other usually goes down and vice-versa. Since there are no
naturally existing 100% true opposites I prefer the term ratio
investing. By this I mean we track the ratio of the first item to
the second by dividing one by the other and then chart the ratio.
By looking at the graphical representation, we can see that when
the chart is rising, item &#147;A&#148; is out performing item
&#147;B&#148; and the reverse is true when the chart is falling. </p>

<p>The primary pair that we watch is the Gold vs. Bond Ratio
because Gold tends to rise with inflation while Bonds tend to
rise with disinflation. In addition, Bonds rise as interest rates
fall and Gold rises as interest rate rise. One reason we pay
particular attention to this ratio is the excellence of our Moore
Inflation Predictor (MIP). since it predicts turning points so
well we can gauge when to expect a turn in the inflation/interest
rate trend and begin watching the more precise (short term)
timing indicators such as the Relative Strength Index and Moving
Averages. </p>

<p>An interesting Ratio we have not looked at before is between
Energy and Transportation. It would seem obvious that rising
energy costs would decrease the profitability of transportation
companies. Thus causing their stock prices to fall. This should
make this a prime candidate for an opposite pair ratio. </p>

<p>In actuality, the pair has a correlation of .369. A
correlation of 1.0 would mean that they always moved in the same
direction. A correlation of negative one (-1.0) would mean they
always move in opposite directions. This .369 means that about a
third of the time they move in the same direction. This is
probably due to the fact that when the overall stock market is
rising or falling both funds are carried along. </p>

<p>On page one we have included a chart of the ratio of Fidelity
Select Energy vs. Fidelity Select Transportation. This is a very
easy ratio to trade Since it is in the same Fund Family. </p>

<p>As we can see the period from 1989 to 1992 could have been
very profitable for switch traders. During 89-90 energy prices
rose significantly. During 91-92 while Transports rose Energy
fell. With perfect 20-20 hindsight we can choose the following
portfolio. </p>

<p>On February 23,rd 1989, Fidelity Select Energy (FSESX) was
trading at $7.36 while Fidelity Select Transportations (FSRFX)
was trading at $7.80. The ratio of Energy divided by Transports
was point 0.94 or 94%. Assuming we bought 100 shares of FSESX it
would have cost $736. On September 24, 1990, 9/24/90 Energy had
risen to $13.71 while Transports fell 75 to $7.05 bringing the
ratio to a high of 1.94. </p>

<p>At this point we could sell our 100 shares of Fidelity Select
Energy for $1371 for an 86% profit in 19 months. We would swap
for Transports buying almost 195 shares. </p>

<p>Eighteen months later Energy had returned to $8.02/share while
Transports had gone to $11.63. The ratio at this point was a low
.69. Here we could exchange our Transports for Energy again and
get $2267.85 or 282.77 shares of Energy. </p>

<p>Switch trading can be considered a bit more risky than
&#147;buy and hold&#148; but as we can see the potential profits
are also much greater. In dollar terms our $736 Tripled in three
years while those who followed the buy and hold strategy for
Energy earned a total of 8.9% or about 3% per year and Transports
earned 49% or about 16% per year </p>

<p>Since the funds tend to move ins opposite directions a truly
conservative person could buy some of each thus guaranteeing his
principal but limiting any chance for gain to those periods when
both funds were rising. </p>

<p>The key to ratio investing in cyclical funds like Gold and
Bonds is not the dollar price but multiplying your shares, since
often volatile shares will return to their previous prices. So as
long as we are multiplying the number of shares we own we will
eventually profit. </p>

<p>This would be important if both sides decreased., then as long
as the ratio moved in our favor we would have more shares and
eventually we could sell them at a profit. </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_962.gif"
alt="Franklin Growth vs Gold Ratio" width="640" height="437"> </p>

<p>In the case of Energy and Transports, however, both funds have
increased and the ratio has remained relatively flat so it
wouldn't matter much which fund you were in. </p>

<p>The key to remember, though, is that we are trying to multiply
the number of shares we have. In the long run <b>we will always
profit if we watch the ratio and multiply our shares.</b> </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Moving Averages">Moving Averages</a></h2>

<p>The chart on this page shows Franklin Growth Funds vs.
Franklin Gold Funds. By using the 4 week and 8 week moving
averages it is easier to spot a change in direction in the
trends. Growth vs. Gold is another good pair since they also tend
to move in opposite directions. The correlation of these two
funds is .001 almost exactly zero (i.e. neither negative nor
positive). </p>

<p>The major theory of moving averages is that since the average
takes longer to change direction than the stock, fund or ratio
itself. So, when the ratio crosses through its moving average it
is signaling a change in direction. For instance, at peaks the
moving average starts leveling off and eventually the ratio
crosses down through it. The ratio will always cross through a
short term average before a longer term one and finally the short
term average will cross through the longer average. At this point
the ratio direction is well established and is set up for a
change in the opposite direction </p>

<p>The difficulty comes when we get &#147;whipsawed&#148; <i>i.e.</i>
the ratio crosses through the average in one direction and then
the other. This happens primarily at peaks and troughs but may
also occur during long up-trends and down trends. </p>

<p>We are less likely to receive whipsaw signals when using
longer averages but we also miss a bigger portion of the move.
The least amount of whipsawing occurs if you wait for the short
term average to cross the longer term average. Naturally at this
point we have also missed a good portion of the initial move.
This would not be too bad if the initial move started slowly and
then gained momentum but that is rarely how the stock market
behaves. It seems that often the biggest moves are immediately
after a change in direction. </p>

<p>The biggest problem with using moving averages is when we try
to outguess the signals and ignore one because we assume it will
be a whipsaw anyway. We need to act upon every signal. </p>

<p>The best approach is to choose an average that fits your
personality (shorter for risk takers and longer for conservative
investors) and follow all the signals without consideration for
brokerage fees! In the long run it will be much more profitable. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="The Budget Surplus?">The Budget Surplus?</a></h2>

<p>April showed a &#147;Budget Surplus&#148; up 45.6% on the
month from one year ago, according to Treasury Department
figures. This was due to &#147;unexpectedly strong tax
receipts,.&#148; Unexpected by whom? We told you several months
ago that a weak dollar would increase U.S. business revenue!
Naturally, increased revenue means increased tax receipts, which
sounds a bit like &#147;Supply Side Economics&#148; to me. </p>

<p>For the first 7 months of the fiscal year revenues were up 23%
over last year while expenditures were up &#147;only&#148; 13.2%.
Personally, I think Government growth of 13% under a
&#147;conservative&#148; congress is almost treason, especially
when inflation was under 3%! (Where did the 10% increase in
Funding go? And what happened to the &#147;Peace Dividend&#148;?) </p>

<p>Since revenue growth exceeded expenditure growth by 10% no one
will pay attention to the 10% spending increase. But next year
congress will probably increase expenditures by 15% rather than
use the money to reduce the deficit. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="The FED and Interest Rates">The FED and Interest Rates</a></h2>

<p>The Fed decided not to adjust interest rates at its May 21st
meeting. And surprisingly enough this may have been the best
possible scenario for Bonds. </p>

<p>Normally, a cut in the interest rate would spur Bond prices.
But in this perverse market, inflation jitters are gripping Bond
traders. Their fear is that a cut in rates would cause inflation
to re-ignite. Thus causing the Fed to have to raise rates and the
value of Bonds to fall. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP)">The Moore Inflation
Predictor (MIP)</a></h2>

<p>The MIP, however, is indicating that inflation may be in the
works, confirming what the Bond traders fear. We appear to be in
for inflation through next January. However, the proof of the
pudding is in the eating so we need to look carefully at the
ratio chart itself. We need to be alert for a return to the
upside </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_963.gif" alt="May, 1996, MIP"
width="640" height="437"> </p>

<p>So according to these traders raising rates is bad for Bonds
(as usual) and lowering rates is bad for Bonds! As we have seen
in the past few months Bear Market mentality has over taken Bond
traders. Everything is bad for Bonds --this is usually a sign
that the bottom is at hand and a good contrarian would buy with
both hands. It is quite possible we have seen the bottom of this
Bond cycle. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="The Gold vs. Bond Ratio">The Gold vs. Bond Ratio</a></h2>

<p>As we can see the ratio made a top at .7485 and has declined
through its four week moving average and has just crossed its 8
week moving average. </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_964.gif" alt="Gold vs Bonds Ratio"
width="640" height="382"> </p>

<p>The 8 week crossing is rarely a false signal. I have circled
the only three cases on this chart. As we can see the first two
were followed shortly by another crossing which turned out to be
the true crossing signal. </p>

<p>The final confirmation of a change in trend is the crossing of
the short term average through the longer term average.
Unfortunately, by that point usually a big move has already
occurred. At point &#147;C&#148; we see a situation where the
majority of the move was already over. </p>

<p>If that is the case with the third circle, the most recent
crossing is the Bond buy signal we have been waiting for. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, with the MIP indicating inflation in the near
future the rise in Bonds may be relatively small. Similar to the
rise in Gold following the first circle (<i>i.e., </i>from .5852
to .6500.) Although this was the smallest signal on the chart it
still represented an 11% total move in about 2 months. </p>

<p>This chart looks much more like a top than a bottom and as we
said earlier, we need to follow every signal generated. So we are
at this point expecting a flat to declining Gold price and a
rising Bond price for the short term. </p>

<p>We will however be watching closely for an upward crossing
back through the moving average- -signaling the end of the Bond
phase and a rise in Gold. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Relative Strength Index (RSI)">Relative Strength Index
(RSI)</a></h2>

<p>The RSI is a moving &#147;momentum&#148; index that calculates
the exponential moving average of upticks versus downticks. This
is graphed on a range of 0-100% with dotted lines at 30%, 50% and
70%. At 70% the index is &#147;overbought&#148; (<i>i.e.,</i> too
high) and below 30% it is oversold (<i>i.e.,</i> too low) see <b>October
1995 FTF</b> for more detailed information on Relative Strength
patterns and signals. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Benham 2020 (RSI)">Benham 2020 (RSI)</a></h2>

<p>Bonds have been bouncing in the oversold range for a couple of
months now but have been making higher lows on the RSI. </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_965.gif" alt="Benham 2020 RSI"
width="595" height="469"> </p>

<p>Note the negative divergence between the actual price and the
RSI. This last bottom did not cross the 30% line. Combined with
our other indicators this should be the bottom for Bonds for a
while. </p>

<p>Compare this with the negative divergence last summer.
Although the actual price low was about the same in July as in
August, the RSI showed much stronger action. </p>

<p>Similarly, the final price peak in January was almost as high
as December's peak but the RSI, did not even reach the 70% line.
It is possible we will see one more drop toward the 30% line
ending midway (around 40%) similar to last August but it should
be a higher low.. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Benham Gold (RSI)">Benham Gold (RSI)</a></h2>

<p><img src="../images/May_966.gif" alt="Benham Gold RSI"
width="605" height="481"></p>

<p>Gold Relative Strength is showing weakness with the most
recent peak not reaching the 70% overbought line. </p>

<p>By comparing the current situation to the peaks of June
through September, 1995, we can see that we are in a position
much more similar to August or September than to October. </p>

<p>We have not exceeded the high made in early February and RSI
has made progressively lower highs. We hope to see a nice drop
into Oversold territory (à la October 1995) providing us a good
entry point for the next rise in Gold, due later this year. </p>

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Platinum vs. Gold">Platinum vs. Gold</a></h2>

<p>The metals ratio has fallen a bit from last month to 101.9
from a high last May of 114.6. Slightly favoring Platinum over
Gold. A ratio above 110 makes Platinum over priced relative to
Gold while under 105 moderately favors Platinum. A ratio under
100 strongly favors Platinum. (See the March 1996 issue for more
information on this ratio) </p>

<p>Coincidentally, often when the Platinum Gold ratio is at its
lowest Gold is also making its low. Consequently, we may be lucky
enough to see a ratio below 100 at the same point we get a buy
signal for Gold. This would provide us an opportunity to get into
Platinum shares at an extreme bargain. </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_967.gif" alt="Platinum vs Gold Ratio"

<h2><a href="May_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="U.S. Dollar Index (RSI)">U.S. Dollar Index (RSI)</a></h2>

<p>The Dollar index has regained its losses and returned to the
levels of December 1994 (as indicated by the dotted line). But
the RSI is not making new highs, or more precisely, is not
reaching old highs. So, we may be nearing an end to the gains in
the Dollar. The low Dollar of 1995 was good for our balance of
trade and consequently our budget deficit and fortunately the
climbing Dollar has not yet reached levels where businesses need
be overly concerned but I don't think our Government would like
the Dollar to get too much higher. </p>

<p><img src="../images/May_968.gif" alt="US Dollar Index RSI"

<p>The New York Stock Exchange Index is still moving up strongly.
Since early 1995, every pullback to midpoint on the RSI has been
a buying opportunity, but lately the drops have been lower and
the moves have been more volatile. The one good indicator is that
the index has moved out of its trading range and made a new high.
It is still a bit too early to tell but we would hope the RSI
makes it to its old highs before taking a breather on this chart
it is almost there but not quite. </p>
