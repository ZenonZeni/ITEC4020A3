<H2> EXCLUSIVELY FOR MEN </H2>

<P>  TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops was developed exclusively for men and contains five powerful, high-potency herbal extracts from the Amazon Rainforest that have been used for centuries to increase male sexual desire as male tonics and to support male testosterone levels. The key ingredient of this dynamic new formula is a highly concentrated extract of an indigenous rainforest plant called Muira puama (also known as Potency Wood). Recent clinical research has shown an herbal extract of Muira puama to be highly effective in over 62% of 362 men studied in increasing libido and in successfully treating organic and psychogenic-related impotency. Compared to a clinically established effectiveness rate of only 34% for the only available prescription drug for impotency and lack of sexual desire, these are significant new findings.  The other natural  botanical  extracts  in  TOUCHFIRE  HIS  work synergistically with Muira puama to naturally calm nervous tension  and  stress,  nutritionally  support  male  hormone levels, act  as tonics to the prostrate and more importantly they increase sexual desire for men through increased bioavailable testosterone.</P>

<H2>AGING AND IMPOTENCY</H2>
<P>   Men are capable of retaining their sexual virility well past their 80's.  Although impotency is thought to affect over 25% of men over the age of 50, many times it is only temporary and can be reversed with the proper nutritional support. Today, an estimated 10 to 20 million men suffer from erectile dysfunction or some type of organic impotency, and organic causes of impotency account for approximately 90% of all cases in men over 50. This number is expected to increase dramatically as the median age of the population increases. In a 1986 clinical study, it was documented that actual testosterone production doesn't generally decrease as men age, but the amount of free circulating testosterone does diminish as more gets bound to the albumin and becomes unavailable for the body's use. These changes appear to begin by middle age and happen during a natural chemical process called ''sex-hormone-binding-globulin" or ''SHBG''. Other researchers believe that the increase in SHBG is a major contributing factor in prostate disorders, impotency and a decline in sex drive.  New European research reported in 1995 reveals that an extract of Nettle Root can interfere with this SHBG binding process by almost l0-fold.</P>

<H2>LONG HISTORY OF DYNAMIC EFFECTS</H2>
<P>  Muira puama has long been valued by the Peruvian and Brazilian Indians to increase sexual desire in men, and as a tonic for the nervous system. This has been documented in books written as early as 1930. This long history and substantial documentation has led current researchers like Dr. Waynberg to clinically evaluate it's effectiveness as a sexual stimulant and a possible treatment for impotency.   Catuaba, the  most famous of all Brazilian sexual enhancing plants, has been so highly regarded as a male libido enhancer and sexual stimulant that the Tupi Indians have praised it's wonders in many songs for generations.  Damiana has such an ancient reputation that it was even carried over to its botanical name, Turnera aphrodisiaca.  After centuries of use, renown herbalists like David Hoffman, now believe that its alkaloids could have a testosterone-like action.  Sarsaparilla has a worldwide reputation and history of use dating back to the 1600's as an aphrodisiac and male tonic. It contains at least 9 documented plant steroids, several of which are only found in Sarsaparilla. Nettle Root has been shown to increase free floating testosterone levels, and increased testosterone is a well documented natural libido enhancer.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   The rainforest plants in the TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops contain vital phytochemicals and phytosterols, which nutritionally support the entire male sexual hormonal system as well as the nervous system.  The indigenous people of the Amazon and rainforest regions have used these specific botanicals for centuries, not only as male tonics and sexual enhancers, but also as tribal medicine to fight reduced fertility and male hormonal imbalances, especially lowered testosterone levels. Some have even been used in marriage and fertility ceremonies for decades. Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforests of the world. TOUCHFIRE HIS, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets supporting the health of men by helping to increase their sexual desire as well as helping to naturally and nutritionally balance hormone levels.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   All botanicals in TOUCHFIRE HIS have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like the herbs found in TOUCHFIRE HIS and all Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>
<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE TOUCHFIRE HIS</H2>
<P>  TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops is furnished with a dropper. One dropperful contains approximately 30 drops. For best results, place 30 to 40 drops in two to three ounces of water or juice and take on an empty stomach.  Used as an occasional aid to increase male sexual desire, take 30 to 40 drops one or two hours before intimate activity.</P>
<P>  Most men take TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops on a more routine basis. If you have special needs due to stress or lack of sex drive, take 30-40 drops twice a day for a minimum of 30 days for maximum benefit.
   Many men continue with this twice-a-day dosage on an ongoing basis. However, you may try taking TOUCHFIRE HIS once a day after the initial month.  Each man must adjust according to his needs. TOUCHFIRE HIS contains alcohol, which must be used for extracting and preserving the active phytochemicals found in the rainforest herbs contained in TOUCHFIRE HIS.   If you are sensitive to alcohol, place the recommended dosage in 2 to 3 ounces of hot or near-boiling water and let cool to lukewarm before taking; the alcohol will quickly evaporate.</P>
