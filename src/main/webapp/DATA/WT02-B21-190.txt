<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>It's a disgrace to the justice system
<LI>People forget a man is on trial sometimes
<LI>The trial is idiotic, he should be in jail allready.
<LI>The whole circus is disgusting and the guilty creep might even get off!
<LI>The Limo Driver & dog walker are key witnesses
<LI>Cochran is an imbarrassment to the HUMAN race!
<LI>Cochrane has set race relations back 75 years in this country.
<LI>I'm glad it's almost hopefully, hopefully there won't be a second trial.
<LI>if oj is guilty, I hope LA has fire insurance
<LI>Media should have been kept on a leash....
<LI>The conduct of this trial removes any dought about the integrity of lawyers.
<LI>Great job Judge! Die O.J. Die! We love you Kato!!!
<LI>American Blacks should be ashamed of the race card being used to get a murderer off
<LI>If O.J. didn't do it, who did? He must've done it.
<LI>Ito let this trial get away from him - too lenghthy
<LI>According to the evidence presented, I wouldn't find OJ guilty, but then again I don't know whether to believe he is innocent.  This trial was definitely not a fair one for him.
<LI>trial of the century--my ass.  The murder of 6 million is more horrific than the murder of 2.  The Nuremburg War Crimes Trials is the trial of the century.
<LI>GUILTY AS SIN, HE'LL WALK IGIN
<LI>What a circus!
<LI>OJ is a murderer.  I hope the justice will be done somehow, either convicted or acquitted.
<LI>He's definitely guilty. Race nothing to do with it.
<LI>This is a MURDER TRIAL..NOT BLACK RACISUM!!!!!!
<LI>OJ is quilty.  JC is an insult to people's intelligence.
<LI>one thing to say, DNA cannot lie
<LI>Make changes to the jury system.
<LI>The DA should have waited until a more thorugh investigation had been conducted before arresting anyone.
<LI>I THINK THE TRIAL WAS A LOT OF FUN.  I THINK O.J. IS GUILTY BUT THE FACT'S ARE ON THE DEFENCE'S SIDE.
<LI>This garbage shouldn't be on TV
<LI>The innocent shall die, the guilty shall live.
<LI>very educational, prosection proved their case. 
<LI>Crochrane is a Bible thumping, Bullshitting, Bastard.
<LI>Johnny Cochran is a racist.
<LI>OJ is the Killer...and Johny C. is 2 million richer!
<LI>So money can buy your way out of anything...that's the real crime.
<LI>money and fame should NOT be a factor in the trial.
<LI>It's the best entertainment that money can buy.
<LI>Johnny Cochran made this a racist issue from the very beginning.
<LI>Glad it is nearing the end.  Hope we don't have to do it again!
<LI>Johnny Cochran made this a racist issue from the very beginning.
<LI>It is the biggest circus I have ever seen.  The definition of capital punishment...if you have the capital you don't do the punishment!
<LI>Nordberg!  What have you done?  (Get it? Naked Gun.)
<LI>Fiasco
<LI>Christopher Darden was brilliant, thank you Marcia. 
<LI>The trial is a sad affair for America
<LI>I don't want him to be guility but,,,,,
<LI>Too long a trial
<LI>RON GOLDMAN'S DAD'S THE MOST HONEST ONE THERE!!!!
<LI>on question 16 most all that are on that list as answere are gaining no way to tell without records. thanks
<LI>What a travesty...
<LI>Hes innocent!!!!
<LI>OJ has been treated more fair than he should have
<LI>Using the race issue is a disgrace
<LI>If OJ gets off, our justice system should be abolished.
<LI>OJ & Mister Johnny should spend the next 50 years sharing a cozy jail cell. Would OJ make Johnny his punk? Or would it be the other way around? Hmmm...
<LI>Get ready for race riots in LA
<LI>Best entertainment since Matlock
<LI>grotesque picture,reputed mobsters testify, FBI Agents take 5th is Congress
<LI>grotesque picture,reputed mobsters, FBI Agents take 5th 
<LI>Most TV commentators are either current or ex defense lawyers & as such are biased towards the defense.
<LI>It ia a very big and interesting show!
<LI>disgraceful tactics by defense
<LI>These final comments of Marcia's are not convincing enough to get a conviction, very unprofessional
<LI>For the families of the victims, justice must be served by finding O.J guilty of two counts of first degree murder and lifge in prison without a possibility of paroll.
<LI>travesty
<LI>Sleazy diversion from other news
<LI>It's too bad it's about 'whitey keeping the black man down' instead of about two murders.  Racism is disgusting and outdated but not the bulk of the evidence or case.
<LI>It's a shame, we are in the year of 1995 and "race" still divides this country to the point were people focus on the color of a person's skin instead of the evidents which should lead to an obvious conclusion......O.J. is as guilty as sin.  One day he will have to stand before a holy God (without his lawyers) and answer for the terrible crime he committed.
<LI>This thing is a total circus!
<LI>OJ is GUILTY- and a terrible actor
<LI>He may be dumb but he's no killer!! Maybe they were there for Goldman and Nicole was the bystander
<LI>What the Hell is this trial Shit?!
<LI>The issue of racism is a bunch of bull-sh*t.  This is a trial of murder.  The defence is whining just to find any lame-brain, farfetched idea so they are the winners.
<LI>This is one big game of leaching lawyers seing who can make the "audience" laugh the loudest.
<LI>Don't let Ito get away he's the one who did it!!!!
<LI>Duuuuuuude I think he should quit!!!!
<LI>OJ is fucking guilty....convict the bastard!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>IN EVERY ASPECT, IT'S A JOKE!!!
<LI>Defense knows OJ's guilty, that's why they shifted focus on Furhman.
<LI>It is an exageration of an inept judicial system!
<LI>The case is a mess.  Can't see the forest for the trees.
<LI>Ba Ba Bouie done pulled the switch... smell that burning afro hair.
<LI>harriet thinks he is innocent
<LI>I is the largest crock of crap ever televised
<LI>I'll be glad when it's over
<LI>overheard a juror say... " Mr.Johnny (ooooh he a fine man) I would like to ax you someting... How bouts meetin me for some orange belly wash????
<LI>fuck this trial
<LI>Guilty, but not proven in court
<LI>The #1 rule in law school - if the law is on your side argue the law - if the facts are on your side argue the facts - if neither is on your side muddy the water - does this remind anyone of JC?
<LI>I AM EMBARRASSED TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN TODAY, JOHNNY COCHRAN HAS SET RACE RELATIONS BACK 30 YEARS. AFRICAN AMERICANS CANNOT BE JUDGED BY THE PETTY WEEPING OF A FEW WHO CRY RACE AT EVERY CORNER. POLLS HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE NO RACIAL BITTERNESS.
<LI>Cochran is the biggest sleaze on the planet
<LI>they should just stick to the facts, o.j. did it!!
<LI>I will be glad when it is all over with and everybody SHUTS UP about OJ.
<LI>This trial is a farce. If I were on trial against the same evidence, I'd be hung by now...
<LI>Using Race as an excuse for everything
<LI>I am saddened that race has to rear its ugly head, once more, in the American justice system. Hopefully, someday we will be past all of that.
<LI>racist cops do matter no matter what the da's say.
<LI>I wouldn't put it pass Furhman to plant evidence
<LI>I HATE THIS FUCKING FRED GOLDMAN ASSHOLE.  WHAT A WHINING, WIMPERING LITTLE JEW BASTARD HE IS. SO HIS KID GOT KILLED, BIG DEAL.  THAT HAPPENS TO HUNDREDS OF KIDS IN THE 'HOOD EVERY DAY.  BUT THEY CAN'T GET ON TV.  THE JEW BASTARDS THAT RUN THE MEDIA JUST LOVE TO LET ANOTHER JEW BASTARD HAVE SOME AIRTIME TO PISS AND MOAN. NO WONDER JOHNNI COCHRANE NEEDS MINISTER FARRAKHANS PROTECTORS.  THE JEW BASTARDS PROBABLY HAVE A CONTRACT OUT ON HIM.
<LI>If this is THE example of justice in our courtrooms, we as a country must reevaluate and demand change in our justice system.
<LI>Get Mr. Goldman out of here!!!
<LI> kill The Fucker
<LI>

<LI>"Let's send a message" to all sleazy defense lawyers--YOU GUYS ARE ALL ACCESSORIES TO MURDER! AND GETTING PAID FOR IT, AT THAT!
<LI>Mr. Johnny is a bad person
<LI>They suck, Ito is a complete loser!  I hate them all...
<LI>If acquitted he gets away with murder!!!!
<LI>lying cops, unreliable evidence, closed empty minds
<LI>JOHNNY COCKREN  IS A BIGOT
<LI>SAME OLD DEFENSE.....GOT NO ALIBI, BLAME THE COPS!!
<LI>Christopher Darden summed it up when he said it was a big circus
<LI>survey never mentions victims; kinda like the trial
<LI>OJ's is both the Trial of the 20th Century and the Biggest Crash in History of One Infamous Person/Household Word...to Misfortune and Shame, Next to "None" or i.e. "Mark Fuhrman"
<LI>Johnnie C should rot in hell!
<LI>If upset by the results of the verdict who would be more likely to create a civil disturbance, the black community or anyone else?
<LI>As a federal judge once stated, "you cannot use the constitution as a defense"
<LI>it has been informative,and finally someone is telling the truth about the L.A.P.D.and took them on more people should do that most of them are poor excuse for law enforcement officers i've worked with them I KNOW what they do. I was one of them.
<LI>sucks
<LI>Racism is rampid and bi-partizen between races in this country! WATCH OUT!!    
<LI>He's guilty but sadly, he's gonna go free.
<LI>i am wearing shorts
<LI>This is a travesty.
<LI>To Long, Not Focused, Judge Ito should have taken tighter control.
<LI>Furman planted evidence
<LI>travesty of justice
<LI>The defense team never proved that Vanader or Furman actually had the opportunity to plant the evidence.  In addition, the defense can play the race card and distract the jury, but they cannot refute the existence of the blood trail from Bundy to Rockingham.  It many be reasonable to have Nicole's blood in his Bronco, and Rockingham home, but how do you explain the presents of Ronald Goldman's blood in the bronco.  I didn't think Ronald Goldman ever had the opportunity to ride in the Bronco.  In additi
n, How would the police be able to mix both Nicole's and Ronald's blood and then go to Rockingham and deposit it everywhere.  Any reasonable person must conclude that the LAPD would not have allowed this type of misconduct.  
<LI>It's not the Furhman trial!!!!!!
<LI>Reasonable Doubt shown - doesn't mean innocent
<LI>Johnnie Cochrane's summation----BRILLIANT
<LI>Cochrane is nothing but a lier and a thef
<LI>I don't think he stalked her I know from my own experinces.He had other interest going on. you don't stop and start stalking it is always there. I think their relationship was violent because of the both of them..that's just they way they were towards each other.
<LI>I think it's making a fool of the American judicial system
<LI>Someday, OJ is going to kill me, and get away with it because he is OJ.  - Nicole's diary
<LI>Went on way too long.  I think there is reasonable doubt and there will be a hung-jury.
<LI>Based on this case, our judicial system should be over-hauled 
<LI>It's the American "Justice" system at its worst!
<LI>What a joke.  The analysts on the television are giving many uneducated people a distorted view of what is going on.
<LI>If he gets off I sure don't want to live next-door to him!
<LI>Television ruined the trial/ trial process
<LI>I think JOHNNY COCHRAN did a fantastic job.
<LI>It is sad to think that this man may be acquitted and he is a guilty as anyone ever has been.  The defense did a poor job of giving a definite alibi.  It is because he has none.  If OJ was not guilty there would be at least some evidence that SOMEONE ELSE killed these people.
<LI>It's a travesty on Justice.  Media should not be allowed to report AT ALL until the verdict was given! (As is the case in many European countries)
<LI>After listening to Cochren, I want to shower!
<LI>it is auorizing the weakness and slopiness of the prosecution
<LI>ENOUGH! Naw, TOO MUCH ALREADY!!!
<LI>get it over with
<LI>if it don't fit you must aquit
<LI>It is a travesty that OJ is not really being judged by his peers (ie those among the same socio-economic strata in Brentwood) instead he is judged by 9 members of his race, that is way race will and is playing such a part in this trail. It is not about ra
<LI>I wished that nothing else was ever said about OJ and company.
<LI>It doesn't add up.
<LI>COCKRANES A LIEING USED CAR SALESMAN, BARRY SCHEF IS WHAT GIVES LAWYERS A BAD NAME, SIMPSONS A MARKED MAN, CONVICTED OR NOT, HE WON'T SEE THE YEAR 2000 !
<LI>MONEY BUYS JUSTICE
<LI>Johnny Cochrane's best closing agruments ever I've seen w/closed captioned
<LI>BARRY SCHECK IS THE BEST LAWYER IN THE COURTROOM.  IT'S JUST A SHAME THAT LA IS FULL OF ANTI-SEMITES.
<LI>O.J Simpson is an innocent MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>If marcia clark say's one more tome that't not fair i'll pull my hair out
<LI>They are setting him up!!!!!! It just doesn't fit.
<LI>"Holy Mackell, dat OJ be inacent. When he get off I gonna invite him over for chitlins and wateremelon."  --- One of the jurors.
<LI>Jury sequestration should be banned-too much info not given to them
<LI>Why don't the media actually investigate instead of repeating press releases?
<LI>MORE LEARNING OF LAW & CONSTITUTION
<LI>The defense's ethics are lamentable, to say the least
<LI>Remember the victims. Please stop using hurtful comments, especially name calling and making fun of the tragedy that has befallen the Browns and the Goldmans.  They should be in our prayers!!
<LI>The Goldman family is damn annoying. Shut them up!
<LI>JUSTICE FOR SALE
<LI>motive + opportunity + BLOOD EV. = GUILT!!!
<LI>give him the chair then decide
<LI>I can't possibly conceive how, given the evidence, anyone could think he is innocent!
<LI>a new method is needed to disperse news from a trial so's not to influence jurors
<LI>shame everyone involved
<LI>Give OJ the chair.
<LI>Dat OJ, he be gilty!
<LI>I don't believe anything the defense says, Simpson is guilty, his lawyers are scum.  Electrocute or gas them all!
<LI>Are we done YET!
<LI>Enough is enough.
<LI>The trial kicks ass!  I think it is very entertaining
<LI>I don't think OJ did it, but he knows something about it but afraid to talk. I believe strongly in Mob\drug involvement and police cover-up
<LI>If it cost this much to get a fair trial what chance do we have?
<LI>They should just turn it all off and go away
<LI>Overall, this is again an indictment on the LAPD
<LI>He is guilty-the search was illegal though!
<LI>Brian Kelberg is the best attorney in the case
<LI>IT NEEDS TO END
<LI>enough is enough, shut the coverage down
<LI>I feel this case will never really be solved, because their has been allowed to many other opinions.
<LI>most of us would have already been convicted
<LI>Was Simpson, given a choice in the matter of Courtroom TV?  I think defendant's should be given the choice.  Although I believe Simpson to be guilty, the defendant by law is innocent until proven guilty.  Televising trials can be embarrassing to the "innocent".
<LI>This trial is more about econ status than race
<LI>OJs on trial not the LAPD & everyone else!
<LI>He is guilty as hell......hang him high!!!!
<LI>oj's lawyers no he's guiltier then sin, thats just to bad oj will walk away a free man
<LI>I could never have been a juror
<LI>The time element in the so called planting of the glove proves it couldn't be planted
<LI>its a mockery of our judicial system
<LI>The trial mirrors some of the problems in America.
<LI>Proof positive that wealth & fame influence justice.
<LI>As Nicole said " He's going to kill and get away with it"
<LI>This is RIDICULOUS. OJ did it, but that's not the issue - the issue is the immense media coverage. HE IS ONE HUMAN BEING. We as a nation and a species have more important things to worry about (although this does point to just how insane our justice system has become.)
<LI>Disgusting . . .
<LI>Very Boring.
<LI>o.j. did it. Figure it out!!!
<LI>Who does OJ think he's kidding!!
<LI>I can't believe anyone thinks he's innocent
<LI>The truth is straight forward and simple to state while to convince a jury of a lie will require a million words. The trial, therefore, may not come to an end in this century.
<LI>Ito Goofed -He picked the wrong event to flex his muscle - The TV Camera was NOT in violation of the Client/Lawyers Privaleges.
<LI>O.J'S GUILTY!!!!!
<LI>just killed own wife, when is dream team free?
<LI>This trial SUCKS! It Sucks, I tell you!
<LI>Well never know the truth, damn shame
<LI>A poor use of time and money
<LI>what a joke
<LI>what's on tv after this?
<LI>Henry VI, PartII, Act IV, Scene ii, Line 75
<LI>If he gets off it will be based on race not evidence or lack there of.
<LI>No logical reasonable person could ever believe OJ did not do this brutal inhumane crime!
<LI>Regardless of the verdict, OJ is guilty as hell.
<LI>Wonderful insight into American justice system.
<LI>one big joke!!
<LI>I hope THIS TRIAL LASTS FOREVER.  I can't wait to talk to my grandchildren about it, when the Juice is being re-tried for the 4th time.  ALL NIGGERS MUST DIE!
<LI>it's not justice, it's the law
<LI>it;s obvious...he's GUILTY....
<LI>HE'S GUILTY!!  COCHRANE IS A DISGRACE!!
<LI>It sucks get it off the tv i'm sick and tired of hearing about oj
<LI>Another pitiful example of making the accussed the victim!
<LI>Disgusting waste of time - NO RECORDABLE MEDIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN THE COURTROOM!!!!
<LI>I think it's been going on way too long!!!
<LI>none
<LI>disgraceful
<LI>Poetic justic will prevail in the end.
<LI>money and prejudice by black jurors will free o.j.
<LI>What a pathetic waste of time.  Warm up the fry-daddy.
<LI>If you have money, you can buy your way just about out of anything!!!
<LI>Although this trial may be disturbing, many of the comments on this survey are equally disturbing.  How can people talk about how crazy the trial and it's characters are when they write such vulgar and disgusting comments to be read by people from all over the world.  It makes me ashamed to be American knowing people in my country can display such ignorance.  The trial is no comparison to the sickening attitude many in our society presently have.  How hypocritical!  
<LI>If there is a second trial, don't put it on TV!
<LI>JUDGE ITO WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE THE US CONSTITUTION IF IT BIT HIM IN THE ASS.  ITO IS THE MOST INCOMPETENT JUDGE I HAVE EVER SEEN.
<LI>Money and poor law = no truth or justice
<LI>he'll win on appeal.
<LI>its a joke
<LI>is it over ------ YET!!!!!
<LI>Oh, PLEASE.  This is one case of thousands.  Who gives a fig?
<LI>Juatice will not be done.'
<LI>The trial SUCKS!!!!Its going to last for the rest of my life!!!
<LI>if guilty, God will sort out
<LI>what a waste of money and time for everyone
<LI>Tell me when it's over, PLEASE!!!!
<LI>If he never packs early why did he the night of the murders???
<LI>This trial confirms that if you have the cash, you can legally commit murder.
<LI>The Best Trial EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I am sick and tired of this stinking trial!
<LI>It is a waste of taxpayers' money!!!
<LI>How can the defense insist the gloves did not fit.  They fit the same way in the courtroom as they did on his hands on the videotapes.  Give us a break OJ, all you had to do is pull them on.  Great acting!
<LI>Thank God it is almost over
<LI>Reveals major problems with jury system, LAPD, racial problems, television, America.
<LI>I THINK IT WAS A MURDER-SUICIDE.  NICOLE KILLED GODLMAND BECAUSE HE WAS A FAG AND WOULDN'T FUCK HER, AND THEN SHE CUT HERSELF, SMEARED HER BLOOD AND GOLDMAN'S BLOOD ON A PAIR OF OJ'S GLOVES, WHICH SHE STOLE, AND THEN KILLED HERSELF. FURHMAN FOUND ONE OF THE GLOVES AND THEN PLANTED THE BLOOD AND GLOVE AT OJ'S ESTATE.  
<LI>it blows
<LI>This trial is an embarassment to our country's court system
<LI>I think OJ is guilty, but I think Marsha Clark is a bitch!
<LI>O.J. is scum.
<LI>This trial or "circus" is a waste of tax payers money.  End it now and save the cash.  Everyone knows that he is not going to be found guilty!
<LI>the Dream Team makes me sick. They know he did it.
<LI>ALL NIGGERS MUST DIE!!!!!!!
<LI>Jail the "Dream Team"
<LI>It's a racist show of bigotry.  O.J.'s not guilty of killing anyone, just marrying a White woman.
<LI>The legal system in CA sucks!!!!!
<LI>This trial is a joke, if the defendant was not famous, it would be open and shut within one week.  Pour millions of dollars into it and the circus comes to town.
<LI>the justice in LA is a joke
<LI>Should have hung him by his neck over a year ago.
<LI>a murder is now a circus event
<LI>Why is this on television??????
<LI>obviously, this man's got money to burn.  He's guilty. 
<LI>THEY SHOULD HANG THIS GUY FOR WHAT HES DONE
<LI>Hey, this case and its related aspects are an embarassment to the US, not to the rest of the world. For christ sake!st of the world
<LI>get it over with already
<LI>I HATE THAT FUCKING CUNT MARCIA CLARK!! SHE NEEDS A GOOD, HARD FUCK TO STRAIGHTEN HER OUT. AND THAT TOKEN NEGRO CHRIS DARDEN ISN'T ANY BETTER.  LET'S CONVICT THIS ASSHOLE AND GET ON WITH IT.
<LI>it should be over
<LI>I believe now that Nicole's sister was involved in her murder and she just wanted to get rid of her. OJ just happened to get himself into a bit of trouble with the spouse  abuse. They should not forget about the children they are not stupid eventually they are going to know what's going on.
<LI>I wish the trial would stay on forever
<LI>They should just get it over with, he is either guilty or not.
<LI>WOW...I thought Ringling Bors was entertainment!
<LI>REMBER NICOLE AND RON ? THEY WERE THE PEOPLE MURDERED!
<LI>Barry Scheck is, without question, the best lawyer in this trial.
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin, but will be acquitted because of that racist Fuhrmann.
<LI>Just get it over with.
<LI>The legal systems finest day (pathetic)
<LI>My name is Eddy Soema from Indonesia.  I'm not pleased with the CNN International coverage because they scramble their pictures.  I hoping you will help me and the others Indonesian friends to discramble the CNN International channel, so we can watch the trial and also the update anytime.  Thank you very much, Your concern is greatly appreciated.
<LI>defense stoops to a new low today (9/19/95
<LI>It is a travesty -- any other (normal) person in America would be in jail by now.
<LI>OJ is guilty.
<LI>More OJ!
<LI>Don't squeeze the juice, let him loose
<LI>OJ's guilty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gas his Ass!!!!! of course the jury will not think so. 
<LI>TRIAL IS TOO LONG!
<LI>The defense throws everything at the jury and hopes something will stick.
<LI>KATO DID IT!!!!!
<LI>The entire trial is a media disgrace.
<LI>If he did it, she had it coming
<LI>Money buys freedom!  Trial's a disgrace!
<LI>LA NIGGERS CAN GET AWAY WITH *ANYTHING* AS LONG AS THEY THREATEN TO RIOT.  SHIP THEM ALL BACK TO AFRICA AND AMERICA WILL BE MUCH BETTER OFF.
<LI>Enough already!!!  Why must I hear about it EVERY GODDAMN DAY!  <ahem></A> 
<LI>What Nonsense...
<LI>it's lasted too long.
<LI>It should be took of T.V.    It is discusting!!!!!
<LI>Racism is still dividing this country - Just look at these comments from supposedly educated people with internet access.  People who make such vile comments (whatever their race) are just as lowlife as Fuhrmnan.
<LI>If this was anyone's else trial it would have been over by now instead of 10 months
<LI>I'm sick of it!
<LI>At least this may pop the admiration bubble and spell an end to all the dumb lawyer shows on TV
<LI>Jury should decide verdict, not the media!
<LI>disgusting, sleazy, and corrupt, Is'nt it great!
<LI>I think that had this been an ordinary person this would have been over months ago. But this oj case has taken over a news station down here in florida and I feel that it's disgusting. I'm a journalism major and i can not beleive the media has gone so far. This case is suppose to be about Nicole and Ronald, not the lawyers and their lives.
<LI>I think the media should mind its own business
<LI>A waste of L.A. money.
<LI>It is a totaol farce and I am surprised that it has been allowed to drag on so long. I am totally disgusted at the way the 'nigger' tapes have been allowed into court when they are pretty much irrelevant. Basically, OJ has a motive, no alibi and is the most likely suspect. It seems to me that the prosecution has not presented their case as well as they might have done seeing as the evidence is almost overwhelming.
<LI>Where¹s OJ¹s alibi? Where¹s his proof of innocence? The reasonable doubt clause of our justice system is unreasonable, given the circumstances. I think the burden of proof should fall to the defense with the same requirement made of the prosecution. Proof
<LI>The world should butt out of other people's tragedies
<LI>He should have been excuted by now.
<LI>If an ordinary person murdered their ex-wife no one would care.
<LI>I think the judge should've added more tapings of Johnny Cochrane talking about framing blacks.
<LI>FUHRMAN WOULD NOT RISK HIS PENSION IN ORDER TO FRAME O.J!!..HE MAY BE RACIST, BUT HIS LINE OF WORK AND DEALING WITH THE SCUM OF SOCIETY MADE HIM THIS WAY...THIS BULLSHIT REGARDING HOW HE "PLANTED" EVIDENCE IS A BUNCH OF SHIT DREAMED UP BY THE DEFENSE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR CLIENT IS GUILTY OF MURDER AND THEY ARE JUST DESPERATE FOR ANYTHING...DNA DOES NOT LIE. I SUPPORT MARK FUHRMAN 100%...guy's just doing his job and gets hounded by the BLOOD-THIRSTY DEFENSE..THEYRE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES, LIKE OJ!!.....
C
<LI>fuhrman would not jeopardize his career for oj!!!
<LI>this is a waste of a tv network!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>THE CANCER IS SPREADING, YOU CAN BET THEY WILL RIOT IF O.J.s CONVICTED. AMERICA NEEDS TO STAND UP TO THE SELF SERVING BLACK RACE. THEY DESTROYED THE FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY !
<LI>This trial is a bunch of crap!, and wasted millions! The lawyers are discraces to the job.
<LI>I believe the OJ Trial has been an unfortunate wake up call for Domestic Violence. The News Coverage should be appreciated considering the cost to US Taxpayers! The length of the trail seems outrageous until you think about how serious the charges are and that everything involved should be examined closely - hopefully another trial will not be needed. Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to share my thoughts!
<LI>The judicial system has a self-imposed black eye
<LI>I want O.J. to be either 100% guilty or 100% innocent so we all can move on in life and forget this sad delema.
<LI>racial prejudice and discrimination in the past has distorted and forced the legal process into allowing the media circus we are now seeing
<LI>oj is guiltier than sin
<LI>The media is making WAY too big a deal about it.
<LI>It's a JOKE!
<LI>OJ is being railroaded; Clark wants to win too much
<LI>The OJ case is a great litmus test of stupidity.  Only a moron could believe that he didn't do it.
<LI>Did Marsha Clark pose nude in Canada.  I want photos..
<LI>trials should NOT be broadcast until deliberations
<LI>I am not an "OJ WATCHER", however,I do realize an American Citizen's right written in the Constitution to his/her ASSUMED innocence UNTIL he/she is PROVEN guilty.  Has this basic right changed as a result of this sensational trial?  Or are we all still the same ol' same ol?  
<LI>this is a big joke
<LI>I really think, the Goldman family, and Nicole's family are being put through hell1! I mean they lost love ones, and yes the trial is a joke, get it over with!
<LI>O.J. is great, but he is still guilty.
<LI>Justice will not be served and he's gonna get off.
<LI>it's a shame, but i feel a guilty man will walk...
<LI>OJ is guilty but he will get off. Don't frget victems
<LI>THE HAVE TRASHED OUR INTER CITIES, THEY HAVE RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND NOW THEY SIT AS MAJORITY ON THE SIMPSON TRIAL, THEY WILL LET O.J. OFF EVEN THOUGH THEY NOW HE'S GUILTY. JUST LIKE THE JAPANESE SAY, THE BLACKS ARE THE CANCER OF AMERICA !
<LI>Somewhat fair until the Constitutional Abuse by the Judge. 
<LI>IT IS A FUCKIN GOD DAMN WASTE OF TAX PAYERS MONEY.
<LI>All prosecution witness, defence ask if they know Mark Furman
<LI>Money will usually get you off.
<LI>Johnnie Cochran comes across as a racist.  He shouldn't be pinting the finger at others.  He should not be allowed to conduct trial outside.  They should put a gag order on all the attorneys.
<LI>Free OJ!!!!
<LI>I THINK OJ IS INNOCENT.  IT SEEMS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS FRAME BY A HORRIBLY CORRUPT POLICE DEPARTMENT AND DA'S OFFICE. PLUS, THE FBI IS PERHAPS AS CORRUPT AS LAPD. IT'S VERY SAD TO SEE GOOD MEN LIKE OJ BEING ABUSED BY THE SYSTEM. ANY ABUSE OF HIS RIGHTS IS AN ABUSE OF ALL OF OUR RIGHTS.
<LI>The trial is way too long.
<LI>i hate marcia clarke, oj is guilty but hope he gets off!!! from Dr Pat in Birmingham England. ps watch it every night and its great. pps my girlfriend hates it and me watching it !!!
<LI>OJ SHOULD HANG FOR THIS
<LI>Ito is not able to keep things moving
<LI>For question 16 there shouold be another option like all of the above.  O.J. is 100% positivily GUILTY
<LI>the most blatant display of non-justice ever seen!
<LI>THE HAVE TRASHED OUR INTER CITY'S, RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM, CORRUPTED THE AFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS AND NOW THEY SIT AS THE MAJORITY THE O.J. TRIAL, OH YE ! THIS IS A FAIR TRIAL !!!!!!
<LI>SAD AND A MIRROR OF U.S. TODAY
<LI>The family members are being cheated of a fair trial! Damn, they are the ones who are suffering!! Get this trial over-with! OJ is Guilty!
<LI>NO JUSTICE WITH BLACK DEFENDANTS/BLACK JURORS
<LI>this trial makes me sick he should be fried
<LI>I answered 16 this way beccause it is the prosecution who is using the victums families to speak to the press.  My sister was murdered and the defense attorney in that case resembles the prosecution in the OJ case.  I have seen the lies and deceptions on behalf of the prosecution.  The media may report it one way but I don't listen to the news media they are all biased escept for Larry King.  In the media we are guilty until proven  innocent.   In this county the coronor by law has to be on the scene o
e hour after the police arrive.    You know LAPD is a discusting department.  I am sure glad that my sister was murdered here and not there.  I can thank the DA for this we were handled with great care and concern and the DA's in sisters case were highly ethical.  Marsha Clark and Chris Darden are big winers.  My sister was murdered 21 years ago I did sit through the trial and I do know what I am talking about.  Judge Ito may be sitting up at his table but the prosecution has him sitting in their pocket.
<LI>the cost for getting away with murder is $10m.
<LI>JC says this should be a "search for truth;" yet, the Def. is always trying to skirt around the "real truth"--the physical evidence.
<LI>it is a bunch of croc
<LI>Finish This Trial and Be Done with it
<LI>Get it over with already!!!
<LI>Oj will have the last laugh when he sues LA!!!
<LI>what's the big deal?
<LI>being a suriver of a violent crime victum the prosecution is using the family's of the victums to get there messages to the public.  I sat through the trial of my sisters murder and I have compared the proseution to ours.  They Marcia and Chris should be good defense attorney's they are very deceitful.  If the road that they are wawlking on is a higher road It is much lower that the defenses.   They acturally make the defense look good.  Gill Garsetti well I would not elect him to dog catcher
<LI>Only in America!
<LI>The defense has proven reasonable doubt time & time again. I'm not saying he did or didn't do it- just the prosocution hasn't proven a damn thing!!!! 
<LI>California's justice system is terribly inefficient and slow. The demands on the jurors lives are insufferable . The entire process is an aberration .
<LI>Is the jury singing "I'll Be Home for Christmas?"
<LI>If he didn't have money or fame this would have been over a long time ago
<LI>This whole affair makes me ashamed to be a lawyer.
<LI>we need more oj coverage
<LI>will result in legal reform, undoubtedly
<LI>It is just TOO long.
<LI>TOO LONG
<LI>make Mark Furman Testify in front of Jury, OJ will go free. 
<LI>The trial of the century has dragged on too long.
<LI>I dont care how it turns out, just end the damn thing!!!
<LI>great stuff let's try tom hank's for personality defects
<LI>too damned long; ito is not doing his job
<LI>rest
<LI>get it over with
<LI>It is a complete waste of time and money!
<LI>What MARCIA CLARK, THAT WHINING BITCH needs is a STIFF, THICK BLACK COCK STUFF IN HER MOUTH SO SHE CAN SWALLOW A HOT LOAD OF THICK AFRICAN CUM. AND OJ IS JUST THE MAN TO GIVE IT TO HER, AFTER HE IS AQUITTED.
<LI>He is guilty, period!! Convict him and get it over with!
<LI>THE WHITE RACIST FBI AGENT LIED. THE WHITE RACIST COPS FUHRMAN, VANATTER & LANGE LIED. THE WHITE RACIST DA MARCIA CLARK LIES CONSTANTLY. THAT WHITE TRASH WHORE DENISE BROWN LIED.  THIS WHOLE TRIAL IS A SHAM AND A FRAMEUP BY A WHITE RACIST SYSTEM AGAINST A BLACK MAN BECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE WERE KILLED.  IT SEEMS LIKE MISSISIPI IN THE 1950S.
<LI>Get it over with!
<LI>I feel that this trail is a TOTAL waste of time & money....Fry em'!
<LI>America in Black and White
<LI>Remember there were two people murdered by O.J.
<LI>The Media is totally unprofessional; Nicole Brown's murder and OJ's particiaption should have gotten 15 minutes of media coverage in total.  
<LI>It is a joke. All this time and still no resolution
<LI>justice becomes prime time 
<LI>Enough money = Get away with MURDER
<LI>FREE OJ. FREE OJ. WE LOVE OJ
<LI>Fry the bastard....NOW!
<LI>OJ is innocent, Nicole deserves to die
<LI>confirms a law for the rich and justice for the poor bah humbug!!
<LI>The media are sleezeballs!!!!
<LI>Pathetic - the collapse of credibility for our legal system; many Americans now more cynical than ever about fairness of the "system"
<LI>The prosecution might have lost this trial!!!
<LI>The media has turned our legal system into a circus!
<LI>O.J. is not a God, he is evil.  No matter what happens in this case.  Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.  There is no reason to worry, man is not in control.  O.J. is guilty, sad but true.
<LI>crooked cops/corrupt judge and prosecution
<LI>Prosecution only wants their case. Why have a Defense? Both sides should be able to have a fair shot. Use common sense instead of legal mumbo jumbo and the jury will understand. Judge Ito is very good but he better start being fair to BOTH. Leave the jury hear everything.
<LI>OJ, will not get the death sentence, because he is OJ and has money, but he could get life.
<LI>I have lost respect for the american judicial system
<LI>The actions/reactions by all people involved in this trial where two people were butchered (including the victims families) is disgusting!!!!!
<LI>FRY FURHMAN - FREE OJ.  NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE!!! FRY FURHMAN - FREE OJ.
<LI>There is only one word; BIZZARRE!
<LI>It's taking too damn long!
<LI>HE'S GUILTY- BUT WITNESSES HAVE ALL BEEN ON TRIAL   BEEN ON TRIAL
<LI>Oj has not been proven guilty whithout reasonable doubt. 
<LI>OJ oughta hang!
<LI>ITO IS PRO PROSECUTION
<LI>Whay was bailey allowed to ask a question about racial descriptions without a foundation. Ito screwed up and now is trapped in his own hole.
<LI>it is a prejus. case
<LI>money talks
<LI>I think he is guilty but he didn't do it alone'
<LI>he is guilty,using his name to get off free
<LI>The defense should have the right to clearly demonstrate to the jury just how profoundly Evil Mark Fuhrman really is. Were there opportunities for him to enter areas where evidence was stored? The fact that blood was not taken from a gate until many days after the crime would seem to provide him with mnay chances to plant evidence. It took one O-ring to blast the Challenger out of the sky - it could take just one cop with evil intentions to convict an innocent man.
<LI>its sad that our judicial system is as lame as it it...period!
<LI>OJ's GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
<LI>Simpson probably murdered the two but will go free due to racial feelings exploited by defense lawyers.
<LI>AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM STINKS
<LI>I love Marcia Clark..she's so HOT in a skirt!
<LI>Everyone should get the chair.
<LI>Way too looooooonnnnngggggg!
<LI>It's out of control.
<LI>The Scheme team should go to jail with their client.
<LI>he is 100 guilty
<LI>The whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers
<LI>the dream team are loud mouthed clowns
<LI>I hope it
<LI>I THINK OJ KILLED NICOLE AND RON AND THE PLANTED THE GLOVE IN HIS BACKYARD, SO THAT HE COULD FRAME MARK FUHRMAN AS A RACIST!!!
<LI>He's guilty....juice The Juice!!!!!
<LI>Future LAGITIMATE Racial Cries will be ignored because of defense lies. As a liberal this can only hurt our cause !!!
<LI>GET OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It should be taken off TV and the lawyers should quit spinning their  nightly versions.
<LI>I find the parts of the trial without the jury most interesting. 
<LI>Get it over with!
<LI>Laura Hart McKinney has the stupidest expression on her face all the time.  She's trying to look soooo distressed that she's been 'dragged' into this, but now her tapes are worth $250,000. Just another asshole trying to make a buck from the trial.
<LI>lots of fun, too bad he's got so much money.
<LI>the parents are being delt a bad blow
<LI>I think Ito is prejudiced and is a bad judge.  His refusal to allow better tapes or to allow the cop to be recalled are inexcusable.
<LI>embarassment
<LI>Justice will prevail
<LI>If OJ is so innocent, have him TAKE the stand!
<LI>This whole trial is an embarrasment to American justice!!! It disgusts me
<LI>gass his ass
<LI>I believe it is an example of bureacracy of the judicial system at it's worst.
<LI>According to the law he is innocent UNTIL proven guilty.....everyone should do as the jury has been instructed and wait until ALL of the evidence is in B4 making their decision
<LI>this trial sucks!!!!!
<LI>Doesn't the judge have a responsibility to assume innocence?  He sure rules like he wants to protect the prosecution...
<LI>Ito is too pro-prosecution
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin.
<LI>DNA evidence is irrefutable to intelligent people.  The Jury should know how scarce the fibers are; & that they match being found in the Bronco and at the crime scene.
<LI>Johnny Cochran Ix a complete asshole
<LI>THERE WILL BE NO JUSTICE - O.J. WILL WALK.
<LI>Hmmm...What do we know: Cops hates african americans, and oj's dna, hair, foot prints, gloves (oj once owned a pair of gloves and shoes like those as evidence) are found at the murder sceen.  Therefore we have the police guilty of racism and a man guilty of murder.  It would seem that since racism is a worse crime than murder we should fire the cops and let the murderer go free.  At least that's what some would say.  I am reminded of Jesus, when the was crowd asked who should we free, it was the murder
  Now I'm not suggestion an analogy of furhman to Jesus, but our law enforcement system .  Today in america we have one of the most fair (go to bosnia ) system in the world.  The benchmark for fairness I would contend comes from GOD and this is the comparison I am getting at.  If we through out our law enforcement system because we think its unfair the replacement will be much worse.  Let's leave it to god to punish both the murder and the racist, and get on with our own lifes.
<LI>im glad its almost over
<LI>I'LL BE SAD WHEN IT'S OVER.
<LI>It costs taxpayers TOO much money!!!
<LI>The Police are guilty of planting evidence and that is a greater crime, that the innocent could pay for deeds not done than O.J. Going free and actually having killed.
<LI>See what happens when you kick Nicole Simpson's clit, the juice will kill ya
<LI>up chuck
<LI>What a joke!!!!!
<LI>Its murder not spouse abuse
<LI>Not a very good survey
<LI>ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!!!
<LI>Ito should start letting in some real Defense Evidence instead of covering it up!
<LI>Ferman should be hung
<LI>It's a circus du jour!
<LI>CHRIS DARDEN IS A FUCKING CRY-BABY, PUSSY, FAGGOT AND SHOULD HAVE HIS FUCKING HEAD CUT OFF FOR HIS CONDUCT IN THE COURTROOM.
<LI>Why isn't Mark Fuhrman also on trial for his crimes???
<LI>I've never heard OJ say "find who killed my wife..
<LI>Make it STOP!!!
<LI>Mar Furman is a racist, therefore OJ is not guilty
<LI>Innocent if proven wealthy
<LI>Whether guilty or innocent, the defense has clearly establish "reasonable doubt" with the help of the disgusting Fuhrman.
<LI>Mark Fuhrman SHOULD create reasonable doubt, therefore, aquittal.
<LI>Has anyone checked out OJs brother: BLT Simpson?
<LI>I AM SICK OF THIS DISGUSTING TRIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I will be so happy when it's finally over!!!!  Too bad, but OJ will walk after all this time and money.  He should have commited suicide at the beginning and saved us from this disgusting display of the legal system!!!
<LI>The lawyers are performing for the camera.
<LI>FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND READ IT APPEARS THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF CONVICTING EVIDENCE.  IT SEEMS THE WHOLE MURDER AND ATTEMPTED COVER UP BY OJ WAS SLOPPY.  OJ'S ALIBIS AND THE FACT OF THE CUTS SEEM TO LINGER EVEN AFTER THE DEFENSES BEST ATTEMPTS ARE GIVEN.  THE DEFENSE APPEARS TO PULLING AND GRABBING FOR ANYTHING TO DIVERT THE JURY, INSTEAD OF SHOWING ANY SOLID EVIDENCE FOR OJ'S DEFENSE.  THEIR RESTING THE CASE ON FRUMAN'S RACISM EMPHASIZES THEIR WEAKNESS FOR FACTS AND THEIR FONDNE
S FOR HYPE AND DIVERSION.
<LI>I've got to the point of who cares! get it over with
<LI>I feel extremely sorry for what the jury has gone through. 
<LI>media biased towards prosecution/defense not required to "prove" anything/What happened to the presumption of Innocence?
<LI>When NIGGERS kill NEGGER FUCKERS there NO CRIME.
<LI>It sucks! Fry the guy!
<LI>The more I hear of the Mark Fuhrmann tapes, the more I like 'im!!!!
<LI>as the trial progress I feel that the attitude to the defense is frustrating because mr.Johnny is very annoying spewing out that bullshit about the truth and always getting chris darden's goat whenever possiable
<LI>I wish it would be over soon!
<LI>I wish it would end
<LI>why? why does anyone care?
<LI>Money talks
<LI>He was framed by Mark Furhman
<LI>If Simpson is found innocent, our country is in big trouble!
<LI>I think that this is an example of the morals of this country when you have two dead adults and two children without a mother, and all this country can think about are 2 things: 1. How to make more money off of this case 2. How to hang another black male! I'm disgusted. All the OJ jokes, lies, and bashing can't change history.  It sure is funny how Nichole's family loved OJ when he was beating on her, but the minute she comes up dead, they question him. And I am from LA, I can tell you thousands of sto
ies about the racist LAPD, nothing Furhman did is any different from alot of cops on the force...Really do some background reading about them and alot of cops around the globe, you will be amazed of what you find out!  GET EDUCATED TO THE TRUTH< GET OUT OF DENIAL!
<LI>Kato is a Slimeball!!!
<LI>defense team is making me sick !
<LI>Who gives a flying fuck? The only ones who should care are those that are involved (family and friends)
<LI>O.J. is guilty, but I loved Naked Gun!
<LI>IT IS NOT "WORLD CLASS NEWS" AND DOES NOT DESERVE THE COVERAGE IT IS RECEIVING. IF IT WERE THE TRIAL OF A NON-CELEBRITY, THERE WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN THIS MUCH COVERAGE.
<LI>It is a circus
<LI>In hindsight, it probably should not be on TV.
<LI>This trial is a joke!! Time for the curtain to close!!
<LI>Judge Ito is obviously another racisst scum for not allowing all of the Fuhrman tapes.  Maybe his robe should be white and have a hood with it.
<LI>Disgusting!
<LI>FUHRMAN THE VERMIN SHOULD BE SHOT FOR HIS CRIMINAL RACISM.
<LI>Fire anyone that Gates hired on the LAPD.  (LAPD = Lying And Pathetic Department)
<LI>Don't waste tax payers money if guilty he should die.
<LI>Most valuable outcome of trial: Fuhrman tape.  Drives home why blacks feel they can't get justice.  Prosecution is incompetent.  Wish ability to defend against criminal charges didn't depend on income.
<LI>The whole thing is a travesty of justice!
<LI>it sucks
<LI>I'll be glad when the whole thing is resolved
<LI>It is ashame, that Mark Furman, had anything to do with the case. They should throw out the evidence, he brought in and his testimony, and tell the jury, ok it is gone, we will deal with him at his trial, look at the remaining evidence and make you decision.
<LI>Who Cares?
<LI>This is supposed to be American justice, not entertainment. Too much coverage.
<LI>No way he will be found guilty. They will be afraid of another race riot.
<LI>How ridiculous can we get?
<LI>What about the people who are dead? Do we care who killed them!
<LI>Take off and nuke 'em from orbit!
<LI>it is a shame that the prosecution has such convincing evidence, and the poor jury doesn't even understand what DNA is!!
<LI>OJ will walk. LA afraid blacks will riot.
<LI>I can't believe I wasted my time with this survey!
<LI>This trial is not representational of justice.  The evidence for guilt is overwhelming, beginning with the woman whom he almost ran into at 10:48 on 6/12
<LI>We will have another LA riot if found guilty.
<LI>It would be the best comedy in years if the issue were not so serious.  The system should be changed like numerous countries to have no reporters, TV, press or anyone in the courtroom.  Something more origial should have been done for a sequestered jury for this length of time.
<LI>Pleeeeease! Nuke the court building! Kill them all! Outlaw TV! Do WHATEVER, just make the fucking thing disappear! :)
<LI>FAY "EXPLOIT" RESNECK
<LI>Would this have happened if he wasn't a celeb????
<LI>It's a joke, OJ should have been taken out and shot.
<LI>The defense had the contents of the tapes played publicly because they know the information will get to the jurors outside of the trail since they can't present it in the trial.
<LI>Prosecution is telling too many lies about O.J.
<LI>Pure shit. OJ is guilty as hell.
<LI>I'm sick of it and can't stop tuning in
<LI>Find OJ's shoes, clothes he wore that night
<LI>The focus is incorrectly placed on Fuhrman and the two victims are forgotten
<LI>this trail is so funny that stouptes!!!!!
<LI>This is the most ridiculous thing I've seen on TV...
<LI>Any other trial would have wrapped months ago!
<LI>The race card is bull!!!
<LI>enough oj coverage on tv!  no more!!!!!
<LI>I think that they should just ban the media (i.e. TV coverage) and hurry up and come to a decision.  Just look at the Bernardo trial which was settled in a few months and where TV coverage was restricted.  
<LI>fuck the whole thing
<LI>Go O.J :-)
<LI>It is making a mockery of the U.S. judicial system. It should not be on TV and should have been over by now.
<LI>Even after Furmans secrets,there too much evidence to prove OJ's guilt
<LI>when is it getting over
<LI>It has turned into a joke
<LI>It's a joke
<LI>it's basically all about race ,not justice
<LI>Law and Justice is often a contradiction
<LI>BuLLShiT!
<LI>Where was Fuhrmann on the night of June 12, 1994?
<LI>Doesn't the nation have anything better to do?
<LI>It is disgusting that both sides get to play games.
<LI>I'm glad the prosecution & defense had nothing to do with the creation of our earth, we'd still be on day 2!!!
<LI>Find him guilty and let's move on.
<LI>Do you what the difference between OJ and Christopher Reeves is?        OJ will walk.   OJ is guilty.... no justice no peace  ... the white man will riot.... Johnny can kiss my lilly white ass... no justice no peace... FRY OJ... He's just so fucking guilty, this trial makes my head hurt.  FRY the RAT BASTARD!  Whitey will take it to the street.  1992 will look like a picnic compared to what will happen.  Good luck!  As office Joe Friday used to say "just the facts ma'am".  Well Johnnie can blow smoke u
 somebody else's ass.  Just sign me "Piss off at OJ"  Did everyone  forget 2 people were murdered.  I know I didn't do it.  My blood isn't all over the murder scene.  OHY! I can't take much more of this crap!  Where do I get off this roller coaster?
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin and I wouldn't be surprised if his dream team is responsible for some of this so called planting of evidence.  Kato should stand up like a man and tell the truth!  Furhman is guilty of purjury.  However, OJ is guilty!
<LI>put oj on people's court and decide his fate
<LI>I wish people would let the court do its business, without assuming guilt (what ever happened to not-guilty until proven innocent?) I don't know if he did it, or not, but everyone else seems to have an opinion and that theirs is right (even though they weren't there when it happened!)
<LI>it's awful-the dead are all but forgotten.
<LI>If OJ was white and killed a black girl, this would be over.
<LI>The prosecution and Judge makes me ashamed to be an attorney!
<LI>none
<LI>O.J. is guilty, but you can't convict $10 million.
<LI>let him burn
<LI>let him burn
<LI>Specific to Question #16:  Johnny Cochrane is using the trial for personal nad racial gains.
<LI>When 70% of the Afrian Americans think OJ is innocent and the other 30% don't live in Central LA how can anyone expect OJ to be found guilty.
<LI>O.J.'s lawyers should write fiction, they have created a perfect suspension of disbeleif!
<LI>Race is a issue! defence can ONLY win if the tapes are heard!
<LI>This can happen only in the USA.
<LI>I think that the cop framed simpson i mean somehow that glove just came out of no where, i think he planted the blood on the bronco and all that other jazz, and i also think the whole thing is a crock, if OJ wasn'tthe celbraty he is he would have been sitting in jail for a few months/weeks/year awaiting a fiar trial like every other Tom Dick and Harry!
<LI>He is guilty as sin!
<LI>trial is a microcosm of the state of the Union - a marriage of lawyers & advertisers baiting the public to a feeding frenzy. 
<LI>no
<LI>The trial is a travesty that mocks the concept of justice.
<LI>I am disappointed in judge, he favors prosecution
<LI>quit it already Marcia and the media!!!
<LI>This last ruling of Ito is disgusting
<LI>Money distroys the system. unequal justice 
<LI>I wish they would hurry and finish so I don't have to see it on TV every night.
<LI>i can't wait til it's over so i can see what happens with the menendez brothers
<LI>If he was white he would have been hung already, and nowone would have noticed or cared.  The ass who perged himself may end up freeing the man he wants in jail
<LI>OJ is SEXY!!!
<LI>O.J. is guilty as sin!
<LI>Rotten Police reflect their community
<LI>This trial will prove that niggers can get away with anything if they threaten to riot.
<LI>OJ should fry for beating that little 90 lb woman alone - he deserves no pity!! 
<LI>Go Johnny!
<LI>It O J gets off because of race. It''ll be a joke.
<LI>I hope that jackbooted thug gets the same thing OJ deserves . . . the GAS CHAMBER.
<LI>I think that it should drop off the damn TELEVISION!  I'm tired of my favorite shows being interupted for boring court proceedings!!! It's ridiculous, between the trial and sports!! There's nothing good on TV anymore!
<LI>It's all a conspiracy! Let's just fry him regardless!
<LI>interesting-different-educational
<LI>I just wish it would end...SOON!!!!
<LI>I went looking for Joe Friday and found Bull Connor
<LI>don't _cut_ the deck, 'OJ' it!!
<LI>Get it over with, we all know he did it!
<LI>Just REACH a fucking verdict! The length of this trial is ridiculous.
<LI>I'll be sad when it's all over
<LI>The trial is a waste of people time and money.
<LI>Too much publicity.  O.J.'s JUST another person.
<LI>Jeez, what a sorry excuse for a justice proceeding
<LI>The defense and prosecution have turned it into a circus - obscuring the fact that OJ is on trial!!
<LI>its making me sick
<LI>waste of time, money; folks involved are sorry
<LI>disgusting, everyone has been on trial but OJ
<LI>This is the best evidance for judicial reform yet!
<LI>fuhrman is a racist idiot but irrelevant to the guiley verdcit against oj
<LI>He's black, rich and inperfect that alone makes him a candidate. 
<LI>Abraham Lincoln should've shipped all the "free niggers" back to Africa when he had the change--now it'll take us forever!!! 
<LI>Abraham Lincoln should've shipped all the "free niggers" back to Africa when he had the change--now it'll take us forever!!! 
<LI>CNN should air the damn trail in Europe
<LI>DENISE BROWN KILLED RON & NICOLE BECAUSE SHE WAS JEALOUS NICOLE COULD GET YOUNG STUDS LIKE RON IN THE SACK AND SHE COULDN'T.
<LI>Too bad the real murderer (O.J.) will go free.
<LI>FACT:  Fuhrman is a NAZI.  FACT:  Fuhrman HATES everyone who is not a white male cop.  FACT:  Fuhrman admits on the tapes to planting evidence, framing suspects and being a general bastard.  FACT: Fuhrman 'claims' to have found 'blood' on the Bronco and this precipitated the unlawful entry by police into OJ's estate.  FACT: Since Fuhrman is a liar, the cops had NO REASON TO SEARCH OJ's estate, the search warrant should be thrown out, all 'evidence' found and/or planted during execution of that search w
rrant should be thrown out, and OJ SHOUD BE SET FREE.  All of this is quite sad, because OJ DID KILL RON & NICOLE.
<LI>To solve the problem, we should make both Mark Fuhrman and OJ submit to lie detector tests, and sodium penathol tests to find out exactly, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!!!
<LI>boring
<LI>I wouldn't mind if I never here another word about for the rest of my life.
<LI>I lost interest in the case 10 minutes into the chase!!  GET IT OFF THE TUBE!!!!
<LI>Hurry up and end for F*@!'s sakes!!!
<LI>Hurry up and get this travesty over with
<LI>T*R*A*S*H
<LI>Trial by popular opinion?  Only in America...land of the free, home of the stupid.
<LI>i cringe when marcia resorts to feminine 'wiles'
<LI>disturbing/makes one question justice system
<LI>This is the worst Trial What about Susan Smith?
<LI>Ito's decision to allow TV was devastating to the public's perception of the Jury System
<LI>Big waste of taxpayer's money.
<LI>Probably the most perverted thing i have ever witnessed. This is not justice. It is the antipodia of justice!
<LI>This trial is like the Energizer Bunny...it keeps going, and going, and going.....
<LI>Interesting to watch but police interf. exagerated
<LI>It's all a bunch of bull.
<LI>Mark Ferman screwed the whole thing up.
<LI>LA will BURN if OJ is convicted.  The people of LA have had it with racist cops and a racist just-us system. 
<LI>I'll be glad when the circus is over!
<LI>The "Dream Team" should fry along with their client just for being so dumb. OJ bites the big one 
<LI>Swing the fucking spook
<LI>The defense seems to be on quite a strong comeback. I think that they might actually win this case.
<LI>Even if OJ did it, he should still be set free.  He is the victim of white racist cops, white racist prosecutors and a white racist system.
<LI>By the time we get a verdict, OJ will have already served his life sentence.
<LI>It's all a farce and they should of hung OJ long ago and saved the taxpayers alot of $$$$!
<LI>I absolutely hate the CNN "OJ TRIAL" Theme song!!!
<LI>What a farce - I have not watched 1 minute!
<LI>It is showing America the truth about legal system
<LI>I hate it.  Fuhrman is a loser!
<LI>It is taking too long!
<LI>This trial isn't about justice, it's about who can look good for the camera.
<LI>We truly have a failed justice system when an obviously
<LI>I O.J.is found not guilty money lets guilty go free
<LI>Of course Mark Furhman planted the glove..we all no that a nigger could never be guilty of murder, especially in Los Angeles
<LI>No wonder the Ku Klux Klan came into existence!!!
<LI>I hope they FRY FURHMANN'S WHITE ASS!  He is guilty of criminal racism!!!!!
<LI>It is obvious. the Illuminati is framing both Fuhrman and O.J. Look, nicole was killed on the 12th, only 5 less than 17 and we all know the significance of that number. Fnord.
<LI>Confusion=Reasonable Doubt in this trial
<LI>How to punish OJ:  Ship him back to Africa.
<LI>I'm not sure who is sleazier, Denise Brown or Marcia Clark!?!?   
<LI>Judge Ito should be put to pasture.
<LI>The defense has done an excellent job of presenting REASONABLE DOUBT.  Remember, it is the evidence that is on trial, not the accused.  FREE OJ!  NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE!  FREE OJ!!!
<LI>FARCE! great for a laugh
<LI>It is over-rated.
<LI>OJ is guilty of having my money, thats enough to lock him up!
<LI>Pitiful.  Ridiculous that it's taken so long.
<LI>O.J. will probably get off and thats really sad.
<LI>money makes the difference
<LI>The defense team is a joke
<LI>take out the tv cameras!!!
<LI>Looks like OJ guilty...but the cops are surely crooked as hell, and liars.
<LI>ITO IS BEST OF ALL. NO ONE DESERVES THE PREJUDGEMENT OJ HAS RECEIVED. THE POLICE VIOLATED OJ AND OTHERS RIGHTS IN GOING OVER THE GATE. THEY LIED!
<LI>Defense should be allowed "equal" court time.
<LI>Sad. Pathetic. Travesty of Justice. 'Nuff Said.
<LI>A mockery of the judicial process
<LI>why not add 'all' to question 16?
<LI>I'm suprised I answered this stupid survey!
<LI>its a circus
<LI>OJ is disgustingly guilty.
<LI>If he's not found guilty then it's a sad day for all of us.
<LI>Why are we wasting so much time on it? including me
<LI>I just hope they quickly get over it!!!
<LI>The evidence says he's guilty!
<LI>No one will ever know for sure!
<LI>Guilty as sin.
<LI>he not guilty it all the evidence is in.
<LI>If the Prosecution would have presented its case, instead of reacting to the defense, all would be over by now, good or bad.
<LI>A ridiculous circus, no possibility of a fair trial
<LI>Get it over!
<LI>Do I have to wear my KKK hood when I apply for a job with the LAPD, or would be enough to just goose-step into the office and snap off a smart "Sieg Heil!"???
<LI>I believe he did it, but he is not guilty.
<LI>zzzzz
<LI>You can't spell. CA taxpayers should be disgusted.
<LI>it is a zoo, and the crime is what has been lost
<LI>Blame Faye Resnick-the druggie;not O.J.!
<LI>I think it is getting old, put something else on TV
<LI>In court, you're innocent until proven guilty.  This isn't Iraq.
<LI>if it were not a celeb. on trial it would already be over and it would likely be a conviction....this does no imply my view of O.J's guilt or innocence just my view of the judicial system.
<LI>I used to like to watch it, but now it's getting boring! FINISH THE TRIAL ALREADY! 
<LI>shows how unfair the court system is 
<LI>THE GLOVES DIDN'T FIT.  FUHRMANN, THE NAZI COP, PLANTED THE GLOVE AND THE BLOOD. VANATTER LIED TO GET THE SEARCH WARRANT. MARCIA CLARK, THE WHINING BITCH, HAS A PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST MR. SIMPSON, IT ALL ADDS UP TO A DISHONEST STACKED DECK.  OJ SHOULD BE SET FREE NOW!!!!
<LI>If O.J. was any normal black man, the freakin' trial would have been over in a month, tops!
<LI>Mark 'the vermin' Fuhrmann was dumb enough to leave bloody footprints behind at the murder scene.  It must be obvious that OJ IS INNOCENT.  
<LI>Get it over with!!!!
<LI>If anyone thinks there can't be a cop conspiracy, they should check on the Shirley King Trial in NY State....Quite a few on New York State troopers are in prison now for planting evidence and lying under oath for that trial and others
<LI>get it over with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>These are the times that try mens souls
<LI>if oj was innocent,  he'd testify!
<LI>He's guilty and the "dream team" knows it!!!
<LI>he did it
<LI>I hate Lisa Kahn, and I think the prosecution could have done a better job, cut all they have is the work of the LAPD.
<LI>it's dragged on too long because of the media circus and games played by the defense. Our justice system is based on one's financial and celebrity status.
<LI>THIS HAS POLARIZED THE WHOLE NATION AGAINST BLACKS
<LI>It just goes to show, you can buy your way out of just about anything.
<LI>The prosecution and LAPD are incompitent!
<LI>Marcia Clark is a whinner.
<LI>O.J. is guilty as sin!
<LI>How get jury for second trial?
<LI>Is it common for American police to be racist extremists like mark Fuhrmann?  The judge should stop this charade now and let Mr. Simpson get on with his life.  It is clear that he was set up by corrupt and racist policemen.
<LI>The only thing OJ is guitly of is betraying his race by marrying a white woman.  But, he has made up for that by hiring a brilliant African-American like Johnny Cochrane.  It's Fuhrmann who should be subject to capital punishment, not OJ.  I'm sure that new footprint found by Dr. Lee belongs to a white man. It was white racists like Vanatter, Lange and Fuhrmann who framed OJ.
<LI>NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE, NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE, NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE, NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE!!!  FREE OJ!!
<LI>We're getting nowhere fast!  Only the criminal knows th truth so face justice is truly impossible. Simpson has money on his side anyway,so, GIVE IT UP!!!!
<LI>It is now abundantly clear that Det. Fuhrmann lied and planted evidence because of his hatred of African-Americans.  This case should be dismissed and OJ should be set free.  Fuhrmanm should be tried for perjury, tampering with evidence in a capital case and criminal racism.  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!
<LI>It's Barry Scheck!!!!
<LI>shows up US lousy system
<LI>help out more
<LI>Can't they hurry up
<LI>Mark "Vermin" (because that's what he is) obviously planted evidence in order to frame a black man.  I predict there will be another uprising and LA will burn if OJ is convicted.  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE, That's the law of the street here in LA, whether you white folks like it or not!!
<LI>I am very tired of this trial, I wish it was over!
<LI>Rich nigger kills a SLUT and a FAG and then the STUPID CORRUPT LAPD SCREW UP THE CASE.  THIS IS JUSTICE, CALIFORNIA STYLE!!!
<LI>I WOULDN'T LEAVE MY BLOODY SOCKS AND BLOODY GLOVE TO BE FOUND AND DUMP THE REST OF MY BLOODY CLOTHES IN CHICAGO. WOULD YOU?
<LI>Who's the asshole who keeps writing "No Justice, No Peace, Free OJ"? Probably the same asshole who keeps spelling "Fuhrman" as "Vermin".
<LI>     I hope it lasts forever!
<LI>It's sleazy and frustrating, but at least it's usually not boring
<LI>HE's GUILTY AS NUTS!!
<LI>OJ is buying his way out of this one.
<LI>It is pathetic beyond comment, is America this bored?
<LI>No TV coverage, no sequestration of jury, no permitting too many hypothethicals.  Also, change the law, so that statements in court are no longer privileged statements and that one can be sued for libel for what they say in court.
<LI>Intelligent people can see through the defense claim of a conspiracy.  Only 
<LI>A 25 cent bullet up OJ's ass would be alot cheaper than the millions this bullshit trial is costing. As for Mark Fuhrman being a racist--I say how could anyone not be a racist living in a city where the blacks commit 80% of the crimes?
<LI>The trial was out of control, I`m glad Ito has been trying to get it under control.
<LI>GOOD  FOR   FUTURE   ATTORNEYS
<LI>Ito has lost control.
<LI>Too long, waste of time and money, boring
<LI>If only this had happened 150 years ago in the Old South.
<LI>O.J. COULD HAVE BEEN SET UP JUST AS EASY AS HE COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIMES
<LI>wasting too much money on it!
<LI>MARK VERMIN, WHITE RACIST COP, PLANTED THE GLOVE AND BLOOD.  FREE OJ!!!!!!
<LI>OJ may get away with murder in this life, but he'll certainly pay for it in the next.
<LI>The judgement of Mark Furman will determine the outcome of this trial...He has prevented any chance of getting a true vedict
<LI>DNA  ALL THE  WAY  
<LI>Get it over with!!!!
<LI>Your American Legal system is a joke!!!
<LI>Get to the point....
<LI>Since the case has gone on sooo long, and obviously guilty person has a better chance of being set free than he should have.
<LI>I just gotta appreciate the fact that we get an innovative TV program every day, thanks for the show!
<LI>It makes a joke of legal system. Should be stopped.
<LI>GOD IS NOT MOCKED, WHATEVER YOU SOW, YOU WILL REAP .... IN THE LANGAUGE OF THE STREETS "WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND"
<LI>God is the only true judge.  Pray that His knowledge of the events of 6/12/94 are revealed.
<LI>He is so fucken guilty, you have to be blind to miss it
<LI>ridiculous
<LI>it's not justice, it's a circus
<LI>I'll be happy to see the end of this bullshit
<LI>this trail is about murder not race
<LI>I think the trial is a waste! They know O.J is guilty!
<LI>I think O.J.IS innocent as the world will find out soon enough.
<LI>OJ is guilty.  The media won't say it, though, so they can claim non-bias.  I think they should sprout some testicles and give their real opinions!
<LI>It's the most overdramatized thing on T.V.
<LI>Prove or disprove.  Don't speculate.
<LI>It's good to see the system take a slap right in the face.
<LI>Unfortunately Shaps and the boys will free O.J.
<LI>I won't even begin!!!
<LI>speed it up!
<LI>THE TRIAL SHOULD BE BANNED FROM ALL T.V.!!!!!!!!
<LI>He's guilty, but he'll walk because of an incompetent jury with their own agenda(s).
<LI>no
<LI>no
<LI>defense has disgraced the system, and themselves.
<LI>KATO PROBABLY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND IS TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR IT.
<LI>Colonol Mustard did it!!! 
<LI>This is a stupid waste of money and I'm pissed!
<LI>lock em' up
<LI>oj is a guilty nigger
<LI>justice is blind yet much swayed by wealth
<LI>Race is a major factor because of jury 
<LI>THE DREAM TEAM AND OJ ARE SCUM
<LI>It's awful!!!
<LI>Mark Fuhrman may be a racist, but he is not stupid enough to plant blood at OJ's.
<LI>The Trial of the Century
<LI>Fry the BUM !!
<LI>too many black jurors
<LI>A First Class Circus!!
<LI>O.J. is 100% NOT INNOCENT!!!
<LI>I hate marcia clark!!!
<LI>What a zoo! It's so obvious he's guilty!!!
<LI>he's guilty,was not planned,crime of passion
<LI>Go Peter Neufield!!!
<LI>We MUST revamp the justice system in America.  This proves it beyond any reasonable doubt!
<LI>Fuhrman needs to be indicted
<LI>Disgustingly slow way to speedy trial.
<LI>Just kill O.J and save some time. 
<LI>it is a farce it has turned into the Furman trial
<LI>The trial is becoming a circus!
<LI>This trial is a farse because they already said they wouldn't seek the death penalty if found guilty.
<LI>i am sick of hearing about the whole thing.
<LI>It's too long!
<LI>Only in AMERICA......GOD BLESS !!!!!!
<LI>The gloves didn't fit!
<LI>TV DISTORTS
<LI>hang the bastard
<LI>Can anyone really believe he's innocent??!!!
<LI>This is not the trial of mark fuhrman!
<LI>Why don't you get gender, race & age for survey
<LI>Finish this travesty of justice!
<LI>Fuhrman's a racist, lawyers suck, OJs Still Guilty
<LI>"A lawyer's profession is to disguise matters."-Sir Thomas Moore, 1516.  Moore must have forseen the Simpson Trial.
<LI>OJ's acting now is worse than in the Naked Gun movies
<LI>It will be a travesty if, due to a racist cop, a killer will go free
<LI>defense lawyers should be de-barred
<LI>It's dragging on too long for anyone to maintain a desire for justice.  What we want now is simply a respite from it all.  A great tactic on the part of the defense team!
<LI>IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE!
<LI>Way too much TV coverage
<LI>A definite PROLONGED circus! The man is GUILTY!! Get it over with!!!
<LI>innocent until PROVEN guilty!
<LI>As a European I don't like the system
<LI>This could be the end for the criminal justice system. I think anyone can get off with a few million bucks!!
<LI>Who Cares
<LI>My opinion is that this is a simple case and I don't understand why it takes so  much time to make a decision
<LI>stupid questions!
<LI>money buys freedom.look at Delorean
<LI>I think This trial should be over fast
<LI>Judge Ito's first and enduring mistake was allowing it to be broadcast.
<LI>He is guilty and he is gonna walk.
<LI>What a shame for the families... Guilty, Guilty!!
<LI>May justice be surved!!!
<LI>It's a shame to see this happen to our legal system
<LI>GOOD THING EVERY TRIAL ISN'T LIKE THIS/
<LI>i think this is a waste of taxpayers money
<LI>Alright Already!!!!!
<LI>Mistrial again? Time to abolish the jury-system    
<LI>OJ should just admit he did it, save his money for his kis, and spare all of us from this charade he's pulling.
<LI>I feel the us legal system in NOT working AT ALL
<LI>to exclude racial bias, there should be no black or white jurors.
<LI>This is a disgrace to the American legal system
<LI>too much time wasted at side bar
<LI>The bottom line is OJ will not get convicted.  Whether he is guilty or innocent is not relevent.
<LI>I've solved it!! Ron & Nicole caught OJ having sex with Kato the dog, and well....why do think the dog ain't talking?
<LI>People should be tried on their actions,not race or wealth.
<LI>Marcia Clark - Quit Whinning
<LI>I hope the "dream team" rots in hell with OJ. They know damn well he's guilty, and this bullshit about the Mark Fuhrman tapes is just a ploy to divert the attention away from OJ. OJ was asked if he was willing to take a lie-detector test and he said no because he had"had dreams about killing Nicole" and felt that that would "affect" the results. Doesn't that tell you something? 
<LI>The trial is proving the system to be seriously flawed, and because it is so public, it will result in several systematic changes.
<LI>Nicole caught O J giving Ron a blow-job and he had to kill them both.
<LI>To convict in circumstantial case you need to trust the investigators and evidence. Not here!
<LI>P T Barnum would be proud of the defence
<LI>If Mark Furman is arrested for Purjury....watch how many people he will take with him....The same as the infamous New York State Trooper
<LI>The whole damn thing is a complete farce. This is what our criminal justice system has come to. Kill him!
<LI>I think OJ is guilty, but not the way the prosecution thinks he is.  No way he kills 2 healthy, athletic people on his own with a knife -- there had to be somebody else with him.
<LI>This is a joke!
<LI>Too long; too costly; unfair to a sequestered jury
<LI>I hate the prosecution team.  They whine, they bore, they repeat and they do not know how to properly cross-examine witnesses.
<LI>Free OJ so that he can KILL WHITEY AGAIN!!!
<LI>try the evidence, not Ferman!
<LI>LA will burn if the GUILTY Motherfucker is convicted so, the bastard will walk!!!
<LI>Defense Lawyers don't need 4 yrs SchooL - Just $$$
<LI>way too long
<LI>Judge Ito is like an elevator,everyone gets a ride
<LI>I think it was a BIG mistake to allow television into the courtroom. Sure, it's entertaining, but it has also affected the trial in a big, negative way. I was hoping Ito would be excused ONLY because I hoped that the new judge would have the presence of mind to pull the plug on the TV camera.
<LI>Money talks. OJ Walks.
<LI>VERY ENLIGHTENING
<LI>The truth will never be known.
<LI>Mark Furman lied, he planted evidence, and is an embarrisment to the LA police... he should be forced to resign and even IF OJ is guilty he has tainted the evidence and therefore made a mockery of the court system
<LI>It's a circus !
<LI>cohran should be disbarred
<LI>Whether oj did it is totally illrelavant,the state has to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt,without violating the law, and they have not done that.
<LI>Whether oj did it is totally illrelavant,the state
<LI>A waste of taxpayer money   WAY TOO LONG!
<LI>It's a joke
<LI>its a 3 ring circus. a mockery of the justice system.
<LI>The jury system doesn't work anymore.
<LI>After all the god-damn money that has been spent on this farce of a trial, and now we could have a Mis-trial because of something said against Judge Ito's wife?! Althought it's obvious now that Det. Furhman is racially prejudice, I still feel that OJ did in fact murder Nicole and Ron.  Why the hell don't they simply give OJ some truth serum?
<LI>I feel that the mofia did it cause of drugs and they mistaken Nicole when they meant to get her friend Faye, and I think that some of the moffia is on the L.A. Police Dept.
<LI>A disgrace to the legal profession!!
<LI>It was intereting when it started but now it's moronic
<LI>Theories not supported by evidence should not be allowed!
<LI>DETECTIVE MARK FURMAN SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR ALL HE IS BEEN SAYING ABOUT OTHER RACES. IF HE CANT DEAL WITH A MULTICULTURAL WORLD THEN THE POLICE STATION IS NOT WHERE HE SHOULD BE. THERE ARE PLACES FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIM.
<LI>turn it off
<LI>Johnny Cockroach and Barry Shithead make a nice couple
<LI>O.J. is guilty, but he'll get off !
<LI>F.Lee Bailey need to wear a girdle, the fat slob
<LI>Has anyone thought about Ron Goldman defending himself by hitting OJ in the nose and causing a nose bleed. Thjs would accout for the many blood drops at the crime scene and there is a chance that OJ did not know his nose was bleeding ?
<LI>would like to get to the verdict soon!!
<LI>I hope a circus like this never happens again
<LI>This trial isn't about race, it's about a domineering, possesive, male chauvinist, who couldn't bear losing control over what he deemed "his property", namely, Nicole. This is nothing new, in fact 54% of women who are killed each year, are murdered by their spouses, either when they leave, or are attempting to leave. Because OJ is famous, handsome and rich, people somehow think that he couldn't possibly have done it. Think again!
<LI>I THINK ITO IS SHOWBOATING
<LI>WHY ASK ABOUT YOUR GOLF CLUBS AS SOON AS YOU HIT LA
<LI>speculation without evidence should NOT be allowed
<LI>Ito should control things more.
<LI>I will be glad when it's over!!!
<LI>he is guilty and if he gets off. God well Know
<LI>I don't know why black people find it so difficult to believe another black person is capable of murder!! White people have no problem realizing that other whites are capable of the exact same thing, so who's being the racist?
<LI>OJ IS INNOCENT, Racist cops conspired with racist DAs and a racist media to frame him.
<LI>all the complaints, yet everyone watches!
<LI>Revelation 14:9:"After the thousand years were ended, Satan was let loose for a little while, and the jury in the OJ Simpson case were allowed to view new DNA evidence....."  This trial is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen in my life!!
<LI>Mark Fuhrman - Grand Poobah of the LA KKK - PLANTED THE GLOVE!  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!!!!!
<LI>If Mark Fuhrman planted the glove, that means that he would have been involved in Nicole's murder. Does anyone really believe that the LAPD has nothing better to do than to sit around going "let's kill a white woman, so we can frame a black man"? Come on people--get with the program and use the brain cells God gave you. 
<LI>MARCIA CLARK IS A WHINING BITCH!!!
<LI>If it were anyone else (say poor, white and not famous, he would be frying right now.
<LI>The evidence against this jerk is overwhelming, and yet this circus continues.  The media just loves it.  Anyone else would have been convicted months ago.  The Dream Team and their Cop Conspiracy are a joke--an insult to normal intelligence.  The most disgusting creature of them all is Kato Kaelin, capitalizing on the death of Nicole.
<LI>O.J. will get to honor a luncheon date with Jimmy Hoffa
<LI>Well? Who killed them?
<LI>The defense should be thrown in jail along with OJ
<LI>Disgusting farce.  Proud to be in different system
<LI>Too LONG!
<LI>joke.can't kill that way w/out blood/injury youself
<LI>Get this crap off TV!!!!!
<LI>Somebody ought to watch the tape of OJ trying on the glove again. He NEVER had the latex glove on....of COURSE the glove wouldn't fit!
<LI>Does anyone remember Nicole and Ron?
<LI>they should fry his ass
<LI>Just end the damn thing so everyone can cash in.
<LI>I hate the OJ Simpson trial!!!
<LI>A sad statement of the legal system.
<LI>Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
<LI>Please End!!!
<LI>It's a complete mockery of what the search for truth ought to be.
<LI>The defence atts are disgusting. Know he's guilty!
<LI>too long drawnout
<LI>pathetic
<LI>George Carlin once said, "I believe we should all live and let live.  And anyone who won't go along with that should be killed."
<LI>Court TV has received the most benefit
<LI>Judge Ito is giving the Prosecution all of the calls.
<LI>Cochrane works for D
<LI>I can't wait til the trial is over.  That will be the best Christmas present that the media could give the American public.
<LI>If it were me on trial, without O.J.'s considerable financial resources, I'd have served nine months of my life sentence by now!
<LI>I believe OJ is obviously guilty and the cop conspiracy theory is ridicules.
<LI>OJ will walk, but he can't hide
<LI>I believe he is absolutely 100% GUILTY but he'll be walking around a free man in a few months just like nothing ever happened.
<LI>evidence is tainted or nonexistant. Marcia is a brat.
<LI>It seems that if a black person is accused of killing a white person, it's labeled a 'conspiracy' by whites, even though all the evidence shows that he's guilty! But if a white man kills a black man, then it's deemed that all whites are out to get blacks! OJ is guilty, any fool can see that--I say fry him
<LI>IT COOL
<LI>The guy will fry, if not here on the street.
<LI>Hey Kato, can you say 'duuhh?' Who is he leaching off of these days?
<LI>Why don't they question O.J. about the knife he bought?
<LI>I think that the only reason OJ is making the headlines is because to white people were killed. Had he killed a black person, I don't think it would have played in media as much. I really think that this country has this thing about a white person's life being worth more. It's a sad thing to say, but being black kind of gives me that inside view.
<LI>A big cost in time/money for what will be a waste of time for everyone in the end, especially since he is a celebrity.
<LI>Spending to much time and money on guilty defendent
<LI>I feel that the prosecution presented alot of circumstantial evidence that points towards O.J.  However, the defense has done a good job showing reasonable doubt.  I do believe that it will be a tough decision for the jury.
<LI>Islamic justice has its merits.
<LI>If he weren't a celebrity, he'd be on death row by now. A black man killing a white woman? Hell, in some states a black man _talking to_ a white woman is a capitol offense.
<LI>just afarts
<LI>OJ is the SKUM of the earth! ZI hope he rots in hell
<LI>Shit or get off the pot!! This trial's too long!!
<LI>Answer to #16: all of them
<LI>this trial sucks so bad!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Answer to #16: all of them
<LI>I think its amazing that this has turned into such an event.
<LI>Until Lawyers are sworn in, justice is not certain
<LI>They need to speed it up!
<LI>if they can't find oj guilty then free manson
<LI>Lee Harvey Oswald did it, he had help from Elvis
<LI>The media should mind their own business!!!!
<LI>It is dumb
<LI>This trial has lasted WAY too long - he should have been found guilty awhile ago - it's all racial.
<LI>shortcomings of ourjustice system
<LI>We need other general info on WEB; detectives, etc
<LI>Fiy OJ!!
<LI>OJ had the means, motive & oportunity & no alibi
<LI>PUKE CITY
<LI>The defense is proving that if they blow enough smoke they can hide the truth.
<LI>It was the tow truck driver
<LI>Free OJ!!!!
<LI>The defense lawyers are all guilty for defending IJ, the murderer
<LI>If OJ is guilty he should pay the govt's costs!
<LI>He didn't kill the devil
<LI>We should have a verdict by the year 2000!!!
<LI>It should have been over 4 months ago!
<LI>I'm glad o.j.is finally doing some time for beating his wife!!!!
<LI>Disgusting/sad, yet enthralling.  If this trial had taken place before television, the newspapers would have been on it non-stop.  Mass media today (to its credit ] and to its discredit) have turned this into a circus.
<LI>...make it go away...
<LI>THE BROWN FAMILY, particularly DENISE have acted like slimy MEDIA WHORES since this whole thing started.  THEY SHOULD BE IN JAIL WITH OJ.
<LI>The look on O.J. Simpson's face the majority of the time shows the guilt that lies underneath, especially when he displayed such amazement and then glee when the glove was too tight, doesn't that tell you something?
<LI>BITTER WHITE BITCH PROSECUTOR, UNCLE TOM ASSISTANT DA, CROOKED FEDS AND RACIST COPS LIKE MARK VERMIN . . . ARE THEY CAPABLE OF FRAMING A BLACK MAN?  YOU BET YOUR ASS THEY ARE!!!  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!!!  FREE OJ!!!
<LI>This trial really pisses me off! It sucks!
<LI>This is yet another sick example of European-Americans oppressing African-American men. 
<LI>Please God! Let it end!!!!!
<LI>Johnny Cochrane? is for the Defense
<LI>frustrating
<LI>it sucks.  Give Juice the Juice!
<LI>Innocent until proven guilty it's ani't over til it's over
<LI>Because OJ is famous, he'll never get a fair trial
<LI>I've learned more about the law from this than anything I've ever seen.  What I've learned scares me!
<LI>IT'S A JOKE, O.J. IS AS GUILTY AS SIN!!!!
<LI>he's guilty,   he'll walk because of who he is.
<LI>It is way too long and expensive.  How is the State going to afford this Trial?
<LI>OJ IS INNOCENT!!  IF OJ WERE WHITE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.  I FEAR THE ACTIONS OF WHITE RACIST LA COPS COULD CAUSE ANOTHER UPRISING IN LA IF HE IS FOUND GUILTY.
<LI>is it over yet? is it over yet? is it over yet?
<LI>NICOLE BROWN-hyphen-SIMPSON was a coke sniffing slut.  Her family are a bunch of leaches who bled OJ and now are sucking $$ out Nicoles death.  The BROWN famil makes me sick
<LI>If this wasnt Oj the trial would be over!
<LI>It's better than mosts soaps on daytime TV!
<LI>If you think OJ is innocent, then you're either a racist, stupid, or both!
<LI>i hope he did it-hope he walks-hope he is 4 hire !
<LI>The Dream Team is lying slime. I'd respect OJ a lot more if he didn't endores their tactics, even as a murderer.
<LI>none
<LI>THIS IS THE MOST ABSURB TRIAL I EVER SEEN 
<LI>the fact that O.J did not have a cut when he flew to chicago indicate any blood of his found definetly came from somewhere else
<LI>superceding everything else said o.j. is innocent
<LI>should not be on tv, should have been over by now.
<LI>OJ'S JUSTICE WILL BE HIS LAWYERS FEES
<LI>OJ'S LIFE IS AT STAKE NOW. HE NEEDS TO TAKE THE STAND.
<LI>This trial sucks!
<LI>its costing too much money, get it over with NOW
<LI>Imagine the productive messages that could be transmitted over all that air time being taken up by the trial!

<LI>Its sad that if you have money and if you don't ?
<LI>It's a joke
<LI>Get over with.
<LI>If this involved anyone other than OJS it'd be over.
<LI>The camera does not belong there.
<LI>It SUCKS!  Netwoeks, get a new line up, 'cause your losin' ratings!
<LI>It's sick to see the system work like this.
<LI>I believe the Jurors will come in with a hung-jury due to racial bias
<LI>waste of time
<LI>They should stop television coverage
<LI>hurry and get it over with.
<LI>If it were you or I on trial, we'd be on death row right now
<LI>boring
<LI>The judge is incompetent, he does not control the lawyers as he should.
<LI>NICOLE TRADED HER LIFE FOR MONEY AND AFTER ALL IT IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.
<LI>He maybe innocent, and is so until *proven* guilty
<LI>I do notthink the trial should have be on TV to begin with.  Had they not put it on TV, it would be over by now.
<LI>It's an embarrassment to America, that people can become famous for being associated with a multiple murder, Kato should get the chair
<LI>I find it difficult to believe that anyone with normal intelligence can doubt his guilt!
<LI>It's pathetic and I'm sick of it.  End it now!
<LI>Follow the Homolka/Bernardo trials in Ont/Canada to see a more acceptable/less media controlled contraversial murder trial.
<LI>The waste of money on this farce sickens me.
<LI>in a word..a circus
<LI>It should be taken off the air immediately.
<LI>You have J Cockrane on survey as (P) he is (D) !!!
<LI>If this is "liberty" give me DEATH.......
<LI>It's between OJ and God.  Only God will judge!
<LI>The trial is on T.V. way too much.
<LI>It is great that americans get to see this slow legal system in action.
<LI>Hope it never ends.
<LI>The prosecution is lousy and the police are worse.
<LI>where is o.j.oldest son?
<LI>world wide our justice system stinks!!!!!!!
<LI>The truth will make sense,but I haven't heard it yet.
<LI>they will never get a verdict
<LI>WHEN FOUND GUILTY HOW LONG FOR THE APPEALS??
<LI>BORRRRRING!
<LI>O.J. sucks a big one!
<LI>Make the execution as public as the trial, as a deterrent to future criminals.
<LI>Cops can't organise days off, let alone conspiracy!
<LI>Hang Him
<LI>It's close to being a fair trial, now let's hang him!
<LI>An international disgrace. Logic has flown this coop.
<LI>Wish I knew what REALLY happened that night.
<LI>too dragged out
<LI>O.J. is a killer and he deserves to get fried.
<LI>I am SOOOOO sick of it!
<LI>It is stupid. Things like that happen every day. Why is it special because a former football player is a suspect?
<LI>It's a bunch of B.S.
<LI>O.J and Susan Smith should be fried together, now!
<LI>Marcia Clark is HOT!!!
<LI>He's guily as sin.
<LI>I think Judge Ito is a wuss.
<LI>Nicole is framing O.J.
<LI>Defense tactics are indefensable
<LI>I wish I was on Court TV
<LI>This trial glamourizes the death of two innocent people
<LI>I think our justice system looks very sad!
<LI>I think its a sad day for our justice system
<LI>It is not the search of the truth just winnning or losing what is important
<LI>please spell names correctly next time
<LI>He's guilty beyond reasonable doubt!
<LI>O.J. is Guilty
<LI>Frankly you should look at the Paul Bernardo trial here in Canada to see how trials of infamous crimes should be done. Your media should not have been allowed to report on the trial before it even started.
<LI>Definitely should not be televised!
<LI>The clothing fibers belonging to Simpson found at the murder scene could not get there unless he was there.
<LI>O.J is guilty! Ba-ba-booey to y'all!
<LI>Undecided until testimony frm lawyer on plane
<LI>Could you imagine if OJ wasn't a celebrity?? Maybe he would have been put to death by now?
<LI>It is a complete waste of all viewers time. Every one involved is there for their own personal gain, except OJ, who has no choice, other than he should not hve committed the murders.
<LI>This has shown the worst side of our system & we need to demand reform.
<LI>Way To Long A Waste Of Tax Payers Money
<LI>For better or worse, (our legal system) the best around.
<LI>money will set O.J. free
<LI>Black rich personable athlete -- can't lose. Sad!
<LI>The trial should be fair but O.J. is famous
<LI>ojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojjojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojoj
<LI>hey! guess what! I farted!
<LI>This was never a trial of race, and the defense should be punished for using it. This is a cas of MURDER!
<LI>I think the general media is very biased!
<LI>He's guilty, but will get off.
<LI>The "wham-bam" defense never materialized.
<LI>it's taking up to much quality air time for other shows like----well just other shows darnet!
<LI>it shows how lame our legal system is.
<LI>sorriest excuse for american justice i've seen.
<LI>BULLSHIT!!!
<LI>THE DEFENSE IS BEING RUN BY THE CLIENT.
<LI>Great example of how bad the US court system is
<LI>It doesn't matter anymore, he has paid w/ $ & time
<LI>will be happy when it's over to see OJ in prison
<LI>The trial is a farce! We'll never know the truth!
<LI>the poor jury
<LI>So Much for Justice
<LI>The Dream Team and this Trial are a disgrace to the Legal Profession
<LI>A shame for the world to see
<LI>the trial should have been over a long time
<LI>he is guil;ty as it gets
<LI>This has been the biggest waste of money I've ever seen.
<LI>I am white Idahoan, that feels the Pros. has no integrity.
<LI>ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO OJ BEING GUILTY. DNA ESPECIALLY
<LI>Restoring public confidence in the legal system may not be possible after this!
<LI>If O. J. is not guilty why did he run!
<LI>Just a BIG MONEY MAKING SCAM !!!!!!!!!!$$$$$$$$$$$
<LI>Power and money give defendants special treatment.
<LI>I's a joke!!
<LI>SEND THOSE 2 JEWISH SHISTERS BACK TO NEW YORK!
<LI>to long
<LI>The OJ trial has more than cost Los Angeles County.  If they were SMART, they'd deliver a verdit by the end of August and let California get back to "normal".
<LI>the judge should not allow this media circus.
<LI>LOT'S OF BUCKS BEING SPENT-HOPE THERE'S NO RETRIAL
<LI>The trial has so much coverage it's turning into a m
<LI>I believe there will be a hung jury with no chance of a fair trial
<LI>Everyone's guilty of something in this trial, but OJ's the guiltiest.
<LI>o.j. will never be convicted because of his race
<LI>Too many defense theories. OJ will have to take stand.  Defense is trying to confuse jury into hung jury.
<LI>re #7 - defense just starting case presentation!  Can't say one over the other coz hasn't happened yet!
<LI>Its a circus!  It should NEVER have been allowd on Television!
<LI>IT SUCKS!!!!!!
<LI>The trial has been interesting to follow.
<LI>Juice the Juice.
<LI>Best lawyer is the prosecutor who cross-examined the County Medical Examiner - he did his homework on his portion of the case.
<LI>While I would not like OJ to take any woman I like out (I dont trust him) I dont think the prosecution can defend the citizens of the state the police are just as bad.  If Oj is guilty prove it fairly, this is not what I have seen.
<LI>The Media is the single biggest problem with this trial.
<LI>Sad.
<LI>they are all poopie heads-they're all OK
<LI>Give me a break. Get it over with-let the man go or convict him.
<LI>The Brown family are a bunch of leaches!
<LI>Why isn't the glove cut in the same place where OJ's finger is?
<LI>Marcia Clark is a f****** BITCH!!!
<LI>DENISE BROWN is a SLEAZY lying, money grubbing SLUT, Just like NICOLE was.
<LI>a waste
<LI>It is to long
<LI>IT'S AN INSULT TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM
<LI>The cameras should have been pulled out long ago!
<LI>He is guilty, but some evidence was planted
<LI>that last man was a genius
<LI>the whole thing gives me a very sad view of mankind
<LI>It is a bunch of BS!
<LI>OJ rules! I love OJ!
<LI>The defense should be ashamed of theirselves.
<LI>take it off the damn television
<LI>This whole thing just proves that you only have to be rich and famous in America and you can get away with murder.  (comment from an African-American, middle class woman)
<LI>Get it over with already!
<LI>A landmark case that will change our legal system.
<LI>Convict him and get it over with.
<LI>THIS HAS TO BE KILLING SOAP OPERA RATINGS.
<LI>WHY DO THEY NEED MEDIA IN THE TRIAL?  I HATE IT!!!
<LI>Televised trial is a FARCE
<LI>How could a man who starred in Naked Gun 1, 2, 3 have it in his heart to kill someone
<LI>get off TV, It should have taken only 4 weeks
<LI>Kato rules!!!
<LI>unbeliveable
<LI>They should all be on trial.
<LI>If not O.J., then who?
<LI>hopefully he gets what he deserves. He's guilty.
<LI>NICOLE GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED.  SHE WAS A COKE SNIFFING TRAMP AND AN UNFIT MOTHER.  GOLDMAN WAS A QUEER, SO WHO CARES ABOUT HIM?
<LI>FBI Agent changed story,adds to conspiracy
<LI>Hey MARCIA - "Show us your tits!"
<LI>The Media Has Swallowed this case and I
<LI>I'm very, very sick of it!
<LI>it absolutely sucks
<LI>money beats the truth
<LI>the whole thing is a  farce! ! 
<LI>it's a joke
<LI>Hey!!!  Chris Darden!!!  WASH YOUR FACE YOU BUM!!!
<LI>if common person on trial we'd been dead already
<LI>This trial show's you what money can do.
<LI>Get this charade over with!
<LI>OJ will walk, hung jury. Case closed. No new trial because they cant get another jury.
<LI>It is sick to see the white man attack and frame yet another African-American - NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE - FREE OJ.
<LI>The evidence is overwhelming...GUILTY!!!
<LI>It's a bunch of crap and shouldn't be on TV.
<LI>It has become a circus.  I believe TV should never have been allowed in the court room.  Ito is just barely competant.  LAPD evidence technicians should be fired.
<LI>It amazes me that OJ can sit there and put his family, friends, victim's family and the public through such a long and expensive ordeal knowing he did it.  It's all about self-preservation in the most despicable way possible.
<LI>I am in the field of Genetics, and He's Guilty!!!
<LI>who else could have done it? It's so obvios that he is guilty
<LI>Simply a disgusting, drawn-out pile of crap
<LI>ALAN IS A JOKE WITH HIS COPS PLANTING THE GLOVE STORY
<LI>I'm sick of minoritys using claims of racism as an excuse for any crime, no matter how violent.
<LI>time and money is being wasted
<LI>I think O.J. stalked Nicole and saw Ron kill her and then killed Ron.  It's possible!
<LI>Give him the Chair!
<LI>Race card should NOT be used!  Dangerous in LA.
<LI>Why did it only take 2-1/2 hours for Susan Smith and so darn long for him?
<LI>The trial is taking up to much time, for the media
<LI>fry O.J.
<LI>Without Simpson's "Celebrity" status and Cochran's "Race Card," the trial would be history.
<LI>This whole thing insults your intelligence.
<LI>too long
<LI>anyone not seeing OJ's guilt is either starstruck,naive ,stupid or a racist
<LI>Hes guilty
<LI>I THINK IT'S GETTING OUT OF HAND.AND MAKING GOOD RATINGS
<LI>very interesting
<LI>The BROWN FAMILY are a bunch of disgusting MEDIA WHORES and liars!!!!
<LI>You can get away with murder, if you have enough $.
<LI>MARCIA CLARK: M E G A   B I T C H ! ! !
<LI>Judge EATO is an embarrasment to the State of California - He doesn't have the BALLS to keep the prosecution in line!
<LI>It's an embarrassment to our legal system, and a burden to CA tax payers
<LI>OJ is being framed by white racist cops, a white racist DA's office and an Uncle Tom named Christopher Darden.  FREE OJ!!!!
<LI>IF HE WERE AN ORDINARY MAN - LOCK HIM UP  
<LI>What a joke! Equal justice, my rear end!
<LI>We need professional juries or no juries
<LI>If your rich your innocent
<LI>Waste of taxpayers money!
<LI>ito-shave, marcia-shave, nicole-deepest apologies oj-dump shaperio and hire gump.
<LI>I think this trial has gotten way out of hand.  Simpson is so guilty.
<LI>OJ is obviously guilty.  Just gas him!!
<LI>It demonstrates the sad state of consciousness of this country.
<LI>It's boring. Leave O.J. alone, he's suffered enough!
<LI>Prosecution-Johnnie Cockroack, Marcia Crap, Chris Poophead
<LI>He did not do it!
<LI>EVERYONE WHO IS MAKING A BUCK OFF IT SHOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AUTOPSY PHOTOS.
<LI>I think this whole trial is a disgrace to the Brown and Goldman family's and it also shows the public how we cannot rely on the justice system to protect us!
<LI>This proves that if you have money you get control
<LI>Ms Sullivan E entertainment Channnel sucks
<LI>Dirty LA cops frame another black man.  I'm not surprised.
<LI>massive media beat up
<LI>A distraction from attn. to our getting screwed
<LI>NICOLE SIMPSON's family, the BROWNS, are DISGUSTING SCUM TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF NICOLES DEATH LIKE THEY MADE MONEY OFF OF OJ!
<LI>It is unimportant compared to other things in life.
<LI>the defense-f. lee poop, rob shitpiro,alan desintegrating,hank goldass, barry shit 
<LI>I think O.J is a killer and he is guilty
<LI>OJ is as guilty as hell, so just gas the crappy,cruddy, freaky ass 
<LI>the whole stupid trial is just crap so just kill him
<LI>WHITE WOMAN AND WHITE MAN GET KILLED.  FIND THE MOST CONVENIENT BLACK MAN AND FRAME HIM. It must be in the LAPD handbook!!
<LI>People have been given the death penalty on a lot less evidence!
<LI>IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IS COMING UP.  SOME SAY THAT THE MOFIA IS INVOLVED AND OTHERS SAY IT COULD BE THE CIA ONCE AGAIN.
<LI>The KeySotne Cops would have done a better job
<LI>It's an abomination, remove it from TV.
<LI>When is it going to end!
<LI>Stoooop! Please No More FUCKING OJ I can take it anymore
<LI>I wish they would all SHUT UP!!!
<LI>it's a total crook.  the media has turned it into a circus
<LI>Free OJ!  Fry OJ! Free OJ! Fry OJ!
<LI>Yet another example of how THE MAN continually OPPRESSES the brothers and sisters......(even though he's guilty)
<LI>It's very excitting
<LI>Defense is bringing up waaay too many different scenarios for what really happened.
<LI>Redundancy puts you to sleep
<LI>LAPD set OJ up, everyone can see that!
<LI>correct!!!
<LI>It really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Its very sad to see that because some one is arrested for a crime...they are automatically convicted by the media.
<LI>WHITE COPS FRAMED OJ -  CASE CLOSED!!!
<LI>WHO'S HOUSE IS KATO STAYING AT NOW???????
<LI>Kill the bastard and his lawyers!
<LI>DNA is about as accurate as TEA LEAVES or Palm Reading.
<LI>We should chuck it and start a new one in a few years.
<LI>I'm surprised more Blacks don't think he's guilty.
<LI>he is guilty
<LI>Will it ever end?!!!?
<LI>They should NEVER have let tv cameras in the courtroom!
<LI>I know he did it; it will be very hard to prove
<LI>Dream team...more like barf bag team!
<LI>I HOPE ITS OVER SOON
<LI>you've spelled Mr. Sheck's name incorrectly!
<LI>The O.J. trial is American capitalism.  Money
<LI>Our Justice System is a farce!!!
<LI>Trial is too drawn out and waffley
<LI>Where does KATO sleep these days????
<LI>This is a good time for Black Americans to show they are not biased,and look only at the facts.
<LI>it's stupid and of course he's guilty.
<LI>Viewers should see all photos, hear sidebars.
<LI>What is OJ is guilty despite a racist cop force?
<LI>Why didn't OJ go ballistic when they arrested him if he didn't do it?
<LI>Good luck OJ,  we LOVE you (still)
<LI>I cannot believe anybody even gives a rats ass!
<LI>O.J. should've sot himself when he had the chance.
<LI>I like listening to the lawers argue motions rather than listen to them question witnesses.
<LI>Domestic violence should be the main issue, not race.       
<LI>Next time NO TV cameras
<LI>It has only proved to be the most racially divisive event since I was born in 1968 -- it is truly an American farce/tragedy.   
<LI>Everyone is trying to exploit the situation
<LI>Get a rope.:-/ This town did hang killers once.
<LI>youpil
<LI>Ugh.
<LI>It shows just how corrupted our justice system is.
<LI>WE LOVE OJ IN BEAVERTON OR.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>your o.j. survey is very one sided. did Marcia make it?
<LI>DEF. ACT PROFECCIONAL AND STICK TO THERE CASE, WERE AS THE PROSS. JUMP AROUND AND CRY IF IT DOESN'T GO THERE WAY
<LI>O.J. had a helper
<LI>It seems like everyone is on trial except for OJ.
<LI>The money being generated from this exploitation should be used pay teachers so that they make more money than laywers; more people would be smarter and wouldn't act like stupid lemmings, intoxicated by the media sensationalism.
