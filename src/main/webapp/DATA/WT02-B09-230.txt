				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;Pioneering International Lottery developer, <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto</a>, have once again pushed back technological frontiers as they introduce two new games, which are destined to delight Internet users for many years to come, as more and more lottery players embrace global games played across the World Wide Web.
  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					‘Lotto Shoot Out’ and ‘Little Big One’ were introduced to game players around the world on Thursday 24 October and both games have proved to be favorites with <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto</a> players new and old. The new games fill a space between <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto’s</a> weekly lottery and their range of instant games. Little Big One is drawn every day. Lotto Shoot Out’s draws take place every six hours.
 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					For years, Lotto players have been clamoring for an alternative to the traditional weekly lotteries that take place all over the world. <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto</a> has filled the gap. Two great new games with frequent draws give lotto players an enjoyable alternative to traditional weekly big win competitions. Playing the new games is more fun, as the waiting time to find out whether you have been lucky is much shorter. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					‘Little Big One’ is run in the same way as <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto’s</a> 6/40 weekly lottery, but there is a draw every day and the odds are significantly better as competitors need only match 5 balls out of 15. Like the weekly lottery, you can buy tickets in advance for future games and use a random generator to decide the numbers you enter to save on time. The lucky player who matches all 5 winning balls wins the entire accumulating jackpot.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto’s</a> other new game, ‘Lotto Shoot Out’ works on a similar basis to common bingo games, but its certainly Bingo with an exciting difference. Bingo has seen a resurgence in popularity over the last few years, and is currently one of the most played games around the globe. Many casinos have even begun to offer bingo games in response to customer pressure.

			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Users select six numbers, as they would if they were playing lotto. The difference comes when the draw begins. Rather than just drawing six balls, the draw goes on and more numbers are drawn until there is a winner. At least one player is guaranteed to win the entire jackpot every six hours. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					To add to the excitement of playing the new lotto games, players can watch the draw as it progresses. As more numbers are drawn your chances of winning accumulate. The more numbers that are drawn before a winner is found, the better your chances are.
 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The Lotto News Network will give you up-to-date information on the jackpots and draws of both the new games, all day every day. Experience the fun of 'Lotto Shoot Out' and 'Little Big One' Now!
