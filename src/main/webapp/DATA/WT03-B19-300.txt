<P>
The CRC for Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and Technologies Ltd is a company established by four universities, six manufacturing companies and the CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology. The Centre was established in 1993 to bring academics and researchers into close working relations with manufacturing industry. By working with the Centre, companies can acquire new technology faster and at lower cost than by other means.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Intelligent Manufacturing Systems marry information technology with the best practices in manufacturing technology and enterprise management. The centre is connected with the international IMS program to ensure that this country has access to the very best technologies.
Industry input defines the needs and priorities for the centre's programs. Eight research projects are in progress worth $6 million per year. The major research programs include:
<UL>
<LI>Enterprise integration - integration methodologies and software tools for small and medium-sized companies. Using these techniques companies will be able to organise and manage themselves to become highly effective in the global marketplace.
<LI>Systems component technologies - enabling technologies such as the "real-time" control schemes, actuators, electric motors, sensors, assembly machines, robots and materials handling machines necessary for manufacturing.
<LI>Shaping and finishing of engineering components to maintain the leadership of the industry partners in their respective high-technology markets.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance</H3>
The industry partners ANCA, Farley and Moldflow all earn more than 50 per cent of their income from the export of high technology. They have in place business plans to expand their product range. This is being done with significant research effort in conjunction with the CRC.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The management and the primary node of the centre is located in Preston, Victoria. The major operations of the industrial partners are also based in Melbourne as is a significant manufacturing base for future projects.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The centre runs regular short courses on a full range of manufacturing technology. It also tailors courses to any industrial needs.
Scholarships are awarded to Masters and PhD students with an interest in manufacturing technology.
