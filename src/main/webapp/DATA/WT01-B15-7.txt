<CENTER><H1>ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE</H1><p>
<H3>4 September 1995</H3> <p>
Copenhagen, Denmark<p>
<p>
<b><H2>Conference Summary</H2></b><p></CENTER>


<b>Introduction</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>On September 4, 1995, 70 individuals from around the world met in
Copenhagen, Denmark for the Advanced Surveillance Technology Conference.
Participants came from over a dozen countries and included leading
technologists, academics, public interest advocates, government officials,
media, and industry representatives. The purpose of the conference was to
discuss new technologies that affect personal privacy.  Participants discussed
closed circuit tv, id cards, computer matching,  computer networks and the
Internet, and encryption. They also discussed possible solutions including
technologies of privacy, industry standards and laws.<p>
<p>
<b>Fusing Flesh and Machine  </b><p>
<b></b><i>Simon Davies, Director General of Privacy International, London,
UK</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>A number of key technological and political trends are converging to
facilitate the creation of Total Surveillance Societies. At the forefront of
these trends is the push for perfect identification of individuals.  <p>
Four factors facilitate that evolution; (1) the development of technical means,
(2) the evolution of political will, (3) the existence of legal mandates, and
(4) the formulation of common standards.  Their subtle interplay slowly
dissolves privacy.<p>
The process requires five steps: (1) deconstruction of the right to privacy,
(2) reconstruction and expansion of a notion of public interest, (3) creation
of "stakeholders", (4) evolution of partnerships, and (5) voluntariness.<p>
The individual right to privacy is first characterized as not fitting in the
technological discourse; it is an unstable, undefinable notion with political
or philosophical overtones.  Privacy is characterized as a selfish concept, to
be done away with. It is gradually replaced by the notion of "data protection",
which is much more manageable.<p>
It then becomes an easy matter to redefine public interest as requiring
surveillance.  United Kingdom authorities plan to install closed circuit
television surveillance in the public areas of over two hundred towns and
municipalities, with the ostensible aim to reduce criminality.  The creation of
DNA databases can also be seen as a way to further the public interest both on
the grounds of public health and of the ability to identify criminals.<p>
The process thereby multiplies stakeholders in surveillance patterns: for
instance, the development of health data networks is promoted on the basis of
public interest and brings the support of the health care community to
surveillance.<p>
Odd partnerships thus emerge.  The merging of public and private sectors, the
development of outsourcing and the apparition of the "profit center" mentality
even in the midst of traditionally  "public sector" activities amplify the
circulation of data.  Already, a quantity of British tax and police data is
held and managed in the United States.  Therefore, everybody has a stake in
obtaining, managing and accessing more information.<p>
All that remains to be done is to circumvent legislation regarding privacy.  It
is easily done through voluntariness: data subjects are invited to provide
information on a voluntary basis.  In the UK, for instance, entire populations
are "invited" to volunteer a sample for DNA testing in relation to major
crimes;  if they won't, they will automatically be considered to be a suspect
and then compulsory tested.  The fact that many privacy laws are based on
principles or mechanisms which have not aged well makes them even easier to
bypass.<p>
Surveillance therefore appears to have a bright future.  It is evolving at a
rapid pace.  As identity cards are fast appearing to be based on a hopeless
technology (Australian banking identity cards were found to be massively forged
in Singapore a month after their introduction), biometrics are being seen as
the identification method with a future. Experiments are already under way
which may, for instance, lead to the use of hand geometry as the identifying
feature in passports, a project in which airlines and various countries show
growing interest.  The use of such passports, which might be issued by the
airlines, would remain voluntary, but various pressures would strongly
encourage passengers to adopt them.<p>
To make the picture darker still, surveillance activities are actively
outsourced to countries where technology-peddling has become a national
specialty.  Things are sure to get worse.<p>
<p>
<b>New Surveillance Technologies and Sub-State Conflict Control  </b><p>
<b></b><i>Steve Wright, Director, Omega Foundation, Manchester, UK</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>We are watching the development of technological fixes to social and
political problems, a trend taking hold in a growing number of countries.  This
phenomenon has primary and obvious effects, but it also has secondary  and
tertiary consequences, which are more important and more powerful than the
intended effects.<p>
The technology takes multiple forms, from "intelligent" fences to the
capability already developed by British Telecom to switch a phone line on from
the switching center and listen in to what is happening in the vicinity of the
phone (System X);  BT also exports that technology.  Biometric systems will
structure the next wave of surveillance methods.<p>
Such technology is often developed in a military context: the Northern Ireland
situation was  a remarkable nursery for new surveillance methods.  It is  used
for policy purposes.  That trend is likely to develop in the United Kingdom,
for instance, where authorities with a long experience in the field of
surveillance, such as MI5, are increasingly looking for a new mission in the
area of police activities.<p>
There is both a demand pull for repression technology and a technological push:
the technology itself spurs the development of surveillance.  Unwanted
surveillance facilities are often built in systems and, once installed, tend to
be used.<p>
Other factors are also at play and even the basic definition of "subversion"
has evolved in British law: from the "overthrow of government by unlawful
means", a fairly restricted concept, it has come to include anything which
"undermines society".  It is therefore not surprising that the fight against
subversion has brought about the massive presence of cameras wherever a
manifestation occurs, with the accompanying chilling effect on expression and
protests.  We are moving from the concept of a person as a citizen of a
community to the notion of a data subject, which makes exclusion easier.<p>
Technological developments related to repression also occur in fields other
that surveillance: much attention has been lent in recent years to so-called
non-lethal weapons, for instance.<p>
What can be done to counter the development of repression technologies in a
context where any one big scare may come to justify surveillance, as that case
where a shopping centre's cameras made possible the identification of the
murderers of a child in Liverpool?  Legislation is  a very primitive tool and
the economy tends to take precedence over human rights: the surveillance
cameras installed at Tienanmen Square were built by an American multinational.
Moreover, it is necessary to control the growth and export of hardware,
software, and liveware.<p>
<p>
<b>European Data Protection: Against the Internet?</b> <p>
<i>Frank Koch, attorney-at-law in Muchen, Federal Republic of Germany</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The Internet is the paradigm of an open, interconnected and worldwide
set of information nets. There is no centralized agency, organization or
whatever institution controlling the net. You can secure your own system by
building a firewall around it but there is no firewall around the whole
Internet or even around parts of it, especially not around the territory of the
European Union (EU). <p>
Privacy exists on the Internet.  That is not to say no privacy problem exists
on the Net.  In particular, transborder data flows on the Net from European
Union countries to the rest of the world will be complicated by the adoption of
the recent Directive. <p>
Personal data may not be freely transferred worldwide through the Internet, at
least not crossing EU borders. Unlimited access to and disclosure of personal
data is unlawful. As a system operator within the EU you may transfer personal
data to recipients outside the EU borders if<p>
(a) the recipient of these data has designated a representative in the Member
State from where you want to start the data transfer and<p>
(b) you can ensure that the data protection legislation in the recipient state
is equivalent to that in your Member State and<p>
(c) you can make sure that nobody unidentified or not entitled to do so is able
to get access to the part of your system where personal data are stored or can
benefit from personal data disclosed to him and<p>
(d) you have informed the data subject (from whom you store personal data) of
the recipients of these data and the rights the data subject has to access the
system of the recipient and to demand reatification of his data if necessary
and<p>
(e) you find out in what way the recipient uses the data during what time, what
security measurements have been implemented by the recipient and whether there
is a second recipient as final destination to whom apply rules (a) - (e) of
course.<p>
All these requirements must be fulfiled before starting the transfer operation.
In that case and under those tightly defined conditions you may use the
Internet for transferring personal data but even then at the risk of being
liable in case you did not find out the country of final destination or cannot
prove that you are not responsible for an event causing damage to the data
subject. <p>

<i></i><b>Regulation and Codes of Practice</b> <p>
<i>Stephanie Perrin, Special Policy Advisor at Industry Canada</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Under the aegis of the Canadian Standards Association, a draft privacy
code has been prepared, primarily for use by the private sector.  The CSA
effort sets out specific standards that companies could adopt to show their
custmoers that they are good corporate citizens.<p>
Impressed with the work of the CSA privacy committee, the Canadian Information
Highway Advisory Council recommended that the application of any such code or
standard should be reinforced by framework legislation.  They also recommended
that the Canadian Standards Association and other standards bodies invite the
International Standards Organization develop a similar data protection standard
which could be related to quality management standards such as the ISO 9000
series.<p>
<p>
<b>Enforcing Privacy through Surveillance?</b> <p>
<i>Malcolm Norris,Data Protection Registrar of the Isle of Man</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The protection of privacy over the Internet is going to be increasingly
difficult.  Life on the net has been fairly civilized up to now, due to the
background of most of its pioneers.  However, its popularity is increasing and
it is highly international: it is therefore very difficult to control.
Monitoring everything on the Net would require a police state and banning it
totally is somewhat unrealistic.  Even border controls are not possible.<p>
In such a context, what happens if part of a Net communication between someone
on the Isle of Man and someone in the United States is intercepted in the US or
is found to be illegal under US law?  Would European law apply to the
interception, would US law apply to the Manx resident?<p>
We want to protect individuals' privacy and see it as paramount, but it is
illusory to think that an international agreement could be struck on that
topic:  European countries took years to adopt the Directive regarding data
protection.  It would be even longer to get other countries to jump on the
train, as countries which were occupied (such as most of Europe during World
War II) are more sensitive to the importance of privacy.<p>
Internet users must therefore recognize that there is basically nothing private
on the Internet and that any communication is susceptible of being intercepted.
It is therefore up to them to use encryption to protect their privacy.<p>
Although law has not quite kept up with technology, all is not lost.  Tools
such as the European Convention on Human Rights can be used to protect privacy
and various interested parties are formulating new ideas.<p>

<i></i><b>Perfect Surveillance and Transportation </b><p>
<b></b><i>Philip E. Agre, assistant professor of communication at the
University of California, San Diego.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Many countries around the world are developing computer and
communications systems to monitor and mange road traffic.  This is variously
known as Intelligent Transportation Systems or Transport Telemantics.<p>
Various systems are already in place or being tested.  For instance, some car
rental companies have started to put global positioning systems in their cars
so as to indicate to the driver the best route to get to his destination.
Global positioning systems also have an impact on workplace privacy in
professions such as trucking, since they allow for the tracking in real time of
any vehicle's position.<p>
Intelligent transport systems are used in various contexts.  They support
integrated logistics and help to manage supply chains such as those involved in
the shipping of goods.  They allow for regulatory automation. They also
facilitate the implementation of an electronic payment infrastructure.  One
potential application is in toll collection, where the system can automatically
adjust the tolls at peak hours, a concept called congestion pricing.<p>
Organizations supporting the implementation of such systems include state and
regional transportation authorities, which have little experience with the
responsibilities that come with handling large amounts of personal information.
Unfortunately US courts have not recognized a legitimate expectation of privacy
on a highway, and this has hindered the development of a notion of a privacy
interest in this area.  Nonetheless, information gathered electronically about
individuals' movements is virtually certain to be abused.  As a result, the
only practical approach to protecting highway privacy is probably to ensure
that the systems are designed to be anonymous. This is eminently feasible, for
example using digital cash for toll collection.  It is crucial, though, that
such decisions be made now, while the basic architecture of the systems is
still evolving, so that bad decisions do not become irreversible later.<p>
The root of the problem lies in the existing methods of computer system design,
whose fundamental premise is the systematic tracking and representation of
human activities.  The point is not just that the activities are "followed" or
"watched"; they must also be actively reorganized and instrumented in order to
make tracking technically possible.  In such a system, privacy protection
techniques tend to be limited to easily subverted policies and software
restrictions on the movements of data once it is collected.  Although the
conventional design methods are frequently taken for granted, they have their
historical roots in industrial motion study. But alternatives do exist,
starting with concepts based on cryptography that deliver adequate system
functionality without ever capturing clients' identities in a centralized
database.  Adequate protection of privacy is thus possible, but it requires
more than a review of regulation: it requires the replacement of the metaphor
behind the system's design.  Intelligent transportation is an excellent arena
in which to demonstrate these emerging concepts.  It is also a crucially
important arena, given the immense harm to civil liberties that could result
from a chilling of the freedom to travel and associate.<p>

<i></i><b>Closed Circuit Television and the Policing of Public Morals</b> <p>
<i>Simon Davies</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The United Kingdom is the most advanced country in the world when it
comes to the implementation of closed circuit television (CCTV) an indirect
consequence of football hooliganism.  The Football Trust gave a grant to
football grounds and to police forces in 1985 to begin implementing
surveillance cameras in and around stadiums.  The initiative snowballed, and
more than one hundred British towns and cities now have complete and integrated
CCTV surveillance systems covering public spaces.  [[sterling]]170 million were
spent in 1994 to implement CCTV and 90 percent of British towns already have
systems or are in the process of implementing them.<p>
Such systems were implemented with a view to stopping serious offenses such as
assault, car theft, and bag snatching.  In fact, they mostly reveal small
infractions and misdemeanors such as urinating in public (even at night,
infrared cameras are able to detect such antisocial behavior) or under-age
drinking or smoking.<p>
These systems are, in essence, military style technology, and their security is
fairly high.  The location of control centers is not disclosed, due to the fact
that one [mistakenly identified] center was the object of a riot in Newcastle
some years ago. Cameras are now protected by bulletproof cases.  Some advanced
systems are so designed that if one camera is disabled, the nearest cameras
will automatically point in its direction to establish what has happened.<p>
The most advanced systems include an array of features.  The zoom is powerful
enough to read a cigarette brand on a pack at 100 yards. Many systems have
movement detection, tracking and infrared. Cameras are also getting smaller:
admittedly less versatile ones (for the time at least) can be found in phone
booths, cash machines, buses and trains, chocolate dispensers, taxis, hotel and
hospital rooms and lifts or on police helmets.  We have come to a point where
one should expect to be photographed: cameras and other bugs are to the point
of becoming ordinary features of household objects.<p>
<p>
<b>Techo-Policing: from Specialization to Common Use </b><p>
<b></b><i>Detlef Nogala, University of Hamburg, Federal Republic of
Germany</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Police work is changing.  We are evolving towards techno-policing with a
tendency to the application of military technology.  The technology allows for
surveillance and detection (including automatic gunshot location), but also for
identification, access to information and processing, communications and better
mobility.  It also supports novel forms of intervention.<p>
The technology is far from being perfect.  Automatic fingerprint ID systems are
out of fashion; identification through facial thermography, which considers
around 65,000 points in a person's face, is apparently extremely accurate --
but is extremely easy to fool by taking some alcohol and thereby inducing
dilation of blood vessels.<p>
There is a growing tendency towards policing by information, using the social
infrastructure in a panoptical and very intrusive fashion.  In such a context,
law is not an appropriate defense mechanism:  what the police can do is simply
legalized.  There are, however, political resistances against that evolution
and technology is expensive, which may somewhat slow its progression.<p>
<p>

<i></i><b>Encryption and the Threat of Universal Surveillance of the Net </b><p>
<b></b><i>David Banisar,  policy analyst, Electronic Privacy Information
Center, Washington, DC</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Cryptography is essential for protecting privacy in the digital world.
Email can be easily intercepted and modified with no ability to verify.
Cryptography can protect the confidentiality of communications. It can also
authenticate that a message is from a particular user and has not been tampered
with.<p>
Although powerful cryptographic tools are available, there are political
obstacles to their use from the law enforcement and intelligence communities
who wish to maintain their surveillance capabilities. Pakistan has forced
Motorola to provide a capability to intercept communications going over the
network the company installed in that country.<p>
The US Clipper chip controversy is well known.   Less well known is advanced
smart card technology using key escrow going under the name Fortezza
(previously Tessera) is to be integrated in the Department of Defense Messaging
System and various commercial systems.  Commercial key escrow agents in the US
will have to provide the government access to the keys and the key length is
limited.  At the same time, export control policies make it difficult to export
US cryptographic systems.<p>
US government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show
that it is the government's desire that cryptographic systems which do not
allow for law enforcement agencies to perform real-time decryption should be
forbidden.<p>
One emerging area of controversy is digital cash of which cryptography is an
essential tool.  There are several different styles of digital cash which
provide different levels of protection.  The most privacy protective are
systems which provide for real anonymity, such as the Digicash system.  A
second type, provides pseudo-anonymous transactions, which do not identify the
person in an obvious manner but have transactions trails built into the system.
An example of this is the Mondex system. Finally, there are a number of system
which operate similar to credit cards which do not provide any type of
anonymous transactions, such as First Virtual.<p>

<i></i><b>Some Positive Aspects of Privacy Law </b><p>
<b></b><i>Blair Stewart, Office of  the Privacy Commissioner, New Zealand</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>New Zealand adopted a Privacy Protection Act in 1993 which covers both
the public and the private sector.   The legislation is one of the most
advanced in the world, along with that adopted in Quebec and is based on the
OECD guidelines, European data protection laws and the Australian Privacy
Act.<p>
 The Privacy Act contains 12 information privacy principles governing the
collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information, however the
information is held. It also has a principle dealing with unique identifiers
and contains individual access and correction rights.  There are limited
exceptions for Parliamentary and media activities.  <p>
The Privacy Commissioner has jurisdiction over data matching, collection, use
or disclosure of personal information; when a complaint cannot be settled, it
is transferred to a tribunal.  Currently, the commission is reviewing such
issues as DNA databases, drug testing and  codes of practice for the police.<p>
Clearly a Privacy Commissioner cannot alone adequately prevent moves toward a
surveillance society. To do that we require a well informed and more vocal
public. We also require Government administrators and lawmakers to be better
informed on privacy issues. We also require business to better consider fair
information practices. All of these ingredients are necessary. However, a
comprehensive privacy law is arguably a very good start in protecting
individuals from intrusive surveillance and other privacy dangers. <p>
