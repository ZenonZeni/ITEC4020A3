<tt>President Clinton came to California on Labor Day, September 4, to defend
immigrant rights and affirmative action.  Clinton said that "we should never
...forget that almost everybody here came from somewhere else."  Clinton
assailed politicians who, he said, mislead middle class voters into thinking
that their troubles are due to immigration and affirmative action.</tt><p>
<tt>In a speech to the American Legion, Republican presidential candidate Bob
Dole proposed making English as the nation's official language, and pledged to
end federal support bilingual education if elected president.  Dole's
endorsement of "English-Only" highlighted the fact that 22 states have now made
English their official language for conducting public proceedings.  When he was
Arkansas' governor, Clinton signed legislation in 1987 making English the
official language of Arkansas.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 180 representatives and 18 senators have sponsored legislation that
would make English the "primary, but not the exclusive, language of
government."  Other proposals would eliminate federal support of bilingual
education, and amend the US Constitution to make English the nation's official
language.</tt><p>
<tt>Colin Powell, son of Jamaican immigrants, asserted on September 18 that
illegal immigrants should not receive welfare and other government benefits,
but maintained that their children should continue to be allowed to attend US
schools.  According to Powell, children born to illegal alien parents in the US
should continue to be US citizens<b> </b>from birth.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration in early September urged Congress to separate
legal and illegal immigration in reform legislation.  This was the approach
taken by the Senate, but the House combined legal and illegal immigration
reform in one bill, and the Senate decided to follow the lead of the
House.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Congress
</a></a>Moves on Immigration
Reform</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration held a hearing
September 13 on legal immigration reform, and another on September 28 on
nonimmigrants.  Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee continued to mark up
its version of comprehensive immigration reform legislation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Although the Administration has not offered a bill, President Clinton has
announced that he would like to sign immigration reform legislation in 1995.
Sponsors are not confident, however, that Congress can approve reform
legislation by year end.</tt><p>
<tt>The legislation moving through Congress would make at least five major
changes.  It would reduce immigration from about 800,000 per year to about
535,000 by eliminating several preference categories, such as the adult
brothers and sisters of US citizens; reduce refugee admissions from about
120,000 annually to 50,000; require family sponsors of immigrants to assume
more financial responsibility for them; establish a national registry of Social
Security and alien numbers to help employers verify who is eligible to work in
the US; and tighten restrictions on the ways US employers recruits  immigrants
to fill vacant jobs.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">Family</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
 
</a></h3>
<tt>In 1994, 804,416 were immigrants admitted to the US.  About 31 percent or
250,000 were spouses, children, and parents of US citizens, who can enter as
soon as their US citizen sponsors have their paper work approved by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service the Department of State.  Under proposed
immigration reforms, only the parents category, under which 56,000 foreigners
entered, would be changed.</tt><p>
<tt>Under other family preferences,  212,000 immigrant relatives were admitted
in 1994.  Four of the five family preference immigrant categories would be
eliminated--those that permit unmarried adult children of US citizens and legal
residents to immigrate, married children of US citizens, and brothers and
sisters of US citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>If current proposals are approved, some 2.4 million foreigners waiting in
queues to enter the US on the basis of family ties would find the family
unification door to the US shut.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are another 1.1 million spouses and children of legal immigrant
residents waiting in a queue to come to the US.  To expedite the unification of
nuclear families, the Commission on Immigration Reform and Congress proposed
that the number of slots for such family unification would be increased by up
to 150,000 per year for at least five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 3.5 million persons waiting to immigrate, about 1 million are
Mexicans, and 500,000 are Filipinos, followed by India, China, and Vietnam.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">Permanent
Economic/Employment.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h3>
<tt>Unlike the House, which made few changes to the system through which
immigrants are admitted for economic/employment reasons, the Senate proposal
follows CIR recommendations and would reduce the number of permanent immigrants
admitted for economic/employment reasons.  It would require employers who want
permanent immigrants to fill vacant jobs to pay fees into a fund that trains US
workers to fill these jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR released its recommendations on economic/employment-based
immigration on September 12.  Under the CIR's recommendations, employers could
bring in up to 100,000 economic/employment immigrants, including family
members, each year, down from the current 140,000, but above the FY94 demand
for permanent visas granted<b> </b>on the basis of achievement and work.
</tt><p>
<tt>Under the CIR's recommendations, instead of applying to DOL to prove that
the employer tried to find US workers and failed, a process termed labor
certification that costs the US government about $60 million per year to
administer, employers wanting foreign workers would pay $7,000 to $10,000 per
permanent immigrant into a private fund that would train US workers to fill
vacant jobs identified by employer requests for immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers willing to pay these fees would be presumed to have searched and
failed to find US workers, and thus save the up to $10,000 they currently pay
lawyers to complete the labor certification process.  </tt><p>
<tt>In FY94, about 123,000 permanent immigrants were admitted under employment
preferences.  However, 30,000 of them were Chinese students who were allowed to
adjust their status, plus unskilled immigrants. This means that only 93,000
persons were admitted under the skilled preferences that would remain if CIR
immigration reforms were adopted -- well under the 100,000 annual quota
proposed by the CIR.  Of those admitted in 1994, 55,000 or 60 percent were
spouses and children of the principal worker for whom a visa was sought.</tt><p>
<tt>The 38,000 "principal workers" admitted for employment reasons in FY94
would have generated $380 million for the training fund had a fee of $10,000
per worker been charged.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC6">Senate</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Action</a>
</a></h3>
<tt>The Senate discussed an even sharper reduction in numbers--Sen. Alan
Simpson's (R-WY) draft bill would admit only 75,000 economic/employment
permanent immigrants each year.  Employers wanting to obtain immigrants to fill
vacant jobs would have to pay a fee equivalent to 30 percent of the first
year's salary into a training fund.</tt><p>
<tt>Some persons representing employers attacked the
fee-in-lieu-of-certification proposal, arguing that employers now demonstrate
their need for foreign workers by their willingness to pay lawyers and
consultants thousands of dollars to navigate through the current labor
certification system.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">House</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
of Representatives Action</a>
</a></h3>
<tt>The House Judiciary Committee on September 18 began to mark up its version
of immigration reform.  The House markup is proceeding slowly, and is not
expected to be completed until mid October.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 21, the committee approved by a 17 to 15 vote the development
of a national registry of authorized workers that would include their names,
Social Security numbers and immigration data.  US employers would be required
to call a toll-free number, or establish a computer link, report the name and
Social Security number or alien number of newly hired workers, and then be told
whether the worker was authorized to work.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US attorney general would be required to establish the national
registry within four years.  If the registry said that the worker was not
authorized to work in the US, he or she would have two weeks to appeal the
registry's determination.</tt><p>
<tt>The system approved by the committee would permit workers to present any of
six documents to employers, but one congressman promised to introduce
legislation that would specify a counterfeit-resistant Social Security card as
the universal work authorization document.</tt><p>
<tt>Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) announced on September 20 that he would offer an
amendment on the House floor that would exclude illegal alien children from
free K-12 education, i.e., incorporate the Prop. 187 provision in US
immigration law.  California estimates that 355,000 unauthorized children are
in California schools in 1995-96, and that their education cost $1.7 billion,
or $4,800 each. </tt><p>

<tt>On September 28, the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration held a hearing on
guest workers and other temporary workers at which multinationals and farm
employers called for amendments to the major immigration reform bills moving
through Congress, HR 2202 and S 269, that would provide high-technology
companies and US farmers with temporary nonimmigrant workers.

<a name="RTFToC9">High
Technology and Foreign
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Under current US immigration law, US employers can obtain non-immigrant
temporary foreign workers under at least nine distinct programs.  High-tech and
multinational firms argue that, since they compete in a global economy, they
need to have access to the best and brightest of the world's workers without
unnecessary government-imposed costs and delays.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one program that was discussed extensively, the H-1B program,
employers who want to hire foreign "professionals" for up to six years "attest"
by filing a labor condition application with the Department of Labor that they
have tried and failed to find US citizens and legal immigrants by offering
prevailing wages, and then DOL must approve their request for temporary foreign
workers unless it is "obviously inaccurate."  </tt><p>
<tt>There is no government test of the employer's assertion that US workers are
not available because the H-1B program is meant to meet urgent and short-term
business needs, and DOL is prohibited from investigating until there is a
complaint filed.  One witness testified that his application for 40 H-1B
programmers to be paid $4.50 per hour was approved by DOL in nine days.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the H-1B program, the jobs for which temporary foreign workers are
imported to fill must require professional skills, which is usually interpreted
to mean that the individual filling them must have a BS/BA--it is not enough
that the foreign worker has a BS/BA, the job must require such a degree.  This
leads to confusion in occupations such as nursing--many Filipinas have BS
degrees, but nursing in the US does not require a BS.</tt><p>
<tt>The H-1B program permits up to 65,000 foreign workers to enter the US each
year and, since each can stay in the US for six years, there can be a maximum
390,000 H-1B workers in the US.  There were 43,000 visas issued by DOS to H-1B
workers in FY94, and the INS reported that there were 106,000 admissions of
H-1B workers in FY94--an INS admission occurs each time that an H-1B worker
with a multi-year visa enters the US.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the
new H-1B visa approvals are for high-tech jobs such as programmers.</tt><p>
<tt>Both employer and worker representatives agreed that the H-1B program has
been abused by so-called "body shops" or contractors in what one witness called
a "techno Bracero program."  Syntel, a Michigan computer programming firm whose
labor force is 80 percent H-1B workers from India, supplied programmers for
insurance company AIG after AIG laid off its US programmers.  Mastech, the
company that maintains the White House's computerized correspondence tracking
system, is under investigation for misusing the H1-B program to import over
1,000 of its 1,200 workers. </tt><p>
<tt>DOL reported that its investigations of complaints found that most
employers with H-1B workers are paying the foreigners less than promised in the
attestation, and that most treat H-1B workers as entry-level rather than
professional employees.  This means that H-1B programmers paid $20,000 may be
used to replace US workers paid $50,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL recommended that US employers requesting H-1B workers be required to
attest that they did not lay off US workers to make room for the foreign
workers, that the employer lay out a plan in the attestation to recruit US
workers, and that H-1B workers be limited to three years in the US. </tt><p>
<tt>In discussions with senators, DOL endorsed the principle that permanent
immigrants admitted for economic/employment reasons should be screened through
some kind of point system, and that US employers wanting foreigners to fill
vacant jobs should generally fill them with temporary foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>DOL also agreed to review a ruling that universities must pay prevailing
wages to H-1B researchers--universities pay much less to temporary researchers
than private industry--and DOL said that it was considering lowering the
salaries that universities must pay by making a distinction between basic and
applied research.</tt><p>
<tt>Several senators questioned the use of research funds to support foreign
graduate students.  According to one survey, over 70 percent of foreign
graduate students in science and engineering, versus 40 percent of US citizen
students, reported that their primary source of support in graduate school was
university research funds.  </tt><p>
<tt>One reason why foreigners predominate among graduate students in many
science and engineering fields, it was emphasized, is because salaries in these
fields are low in the US relative to business, law, and medicine.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related development, DOL announced that it would soon issue
regulations covering part-time employment by foreign students studying in the
US.  Students holding F-1 visas are permitted to work off-campus for up to 20
hours a week while school is in session, provided the US employer who wants to
hire them submits attestations to the Labor Department and the students'
schools stating that efforts to recruit US workers were unsuccessful.

<a name="RTFToC10">Farm
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Farm workers were the other type of temporary foreign workers discussed on
September 28.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers made three arguments in favor of a new program to import temporary
foreign workers.  First, they asserted that illegal aliens comprise a
significant share of the current farm labor force.  Although the best estimates
are that only about 20 percent of the 2 million people who work for wages on US
crop farms are unauthorized, growers testified that illegal aliens are 50 to 70
percent of some harvest crews, and implied that this percentage is typical
today despite the legalization of over 1 million unauthorized workers in the
SAW program in 1987-88.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, growers asserted that the new control measures under consideration
in Congress--more border controls, more interior enforcement, and a national
registry-- will prevent them from continuing to hire unauthorized workers who
present fraudulent documents.  Given the high percentage of unauthorized
workers in the labor force, the growers' argued that effective controls on
hiring illegal aliens will leave them with a labor shortage.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, growers testified that the current H-2A program is too inflexible to
provide them with foreign workers if labor shortages appear.  Most of the
complaints about the H-2A program centered on US workers recruited for
employers at public expense who, according to farmers, do not show up, work
hard, or remain with the employer.  Other factors include the requirement that
growers pay the higher of three wages, prevailing, minimum, or AEWR, and they
provide housing at no charge to the temporary foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers asked Congress to approve an "attestation" procedure similar to
that used by employers to obtain H-1B foreigners for them to obtain foreign
farm workers.  The current H-2A program is a certification program, which means
that the border gate stays shut until the US government opens it and permits
about 16,000 legal farm workers to enter each year.</tt><p>
<tt>Attestation, on the other hand, means that employers open the border gate
by asserting that there are insufficient US workers available, and the border
gate stays open until there are complaints, and the government closes the
gate.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the growers' plan, US farmers, labor contractors, or employer
associations would "attest" that they face shortages of US workers despite the
offer of prevailing wages and working conditions, the listing of the jobs at
local Employment Service offices, and preference to US workers who apply for
farm jobs.  Growers would be able to submit the names of workers who should be
granted nonimmigrant visas in Mexico and elsewhere to come to the US to do farm
work for up to 10 months each year.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers would pay user fees to cover the cost of administering the program,
and the workers would be encouraged to return to their countries of origin
because 25 percent of their US wages would be withheld and repaid to them only
after they returned.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some advocates of the program argue that easy access to foreign workers is
necessary to keep farm wages at a level that would keep fruit and vegetable
agriculture competitive in the global economy.  However, farmers get only about
one-third of the retail value of most fruits and vegetables, and farm workers
receive only one-third of what farmers get, so that, for a $1 head of lettuce,
farmers get an average $0.33, and farm workers $0.11.  </tt><p>
<tt>Even if farm wages rose 50 percent, from today's $4 to $6 range to $6 to $9
per hour, and if all of the wage increases were passed on to consumers, the
head of lettuce would cost consumers $1.05.  Retail prices may fall rather than
rise, as occurred when the end of the Bracero program encouraged farmers and
processors to change the handling of the tomatoes that the Braceros picked.  In
the tomato case, the end of immigrant labor caused production to rise, and
retail prices to fall.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers offered a pre-emptive strike against critics who said that there
were no farm labor shortages by asserting that farmers cannot wait for a
shortage to plan for foreign labor to harvest their crops, that their proposal
was not like the discredited Bracero program, and that, even if the government
tried to push up farm worker wages, there would still be farm labor
shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>Farm worker advocates countered grower assertions on the availability of US
workers.  They made two major arguments.  First, there is no shortage of
workers, only a shortage of decent wages, benefits, and working
conditions.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, employers prefer vulnerable foreign workers to US workers.  In
North Carolina, for example, it was asserted that US citizen-Puerto Rican
workers were sent to employers where they would not have work for two weeks,
and told that they would have to live at their own expense until the work was
ready to begin, while H-2A workers were sent to work immediately.  It is no
wonder, they conclude, that US workers under such circumstances, often abandon
farm jobs, while H-2B workers stay with their employers as required by their
visas.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not clear whether the growers will repeat their successes of the
early 1980s, when they, over the objections of the sponsors of immigration
reform legislation, persuaded Congress to approve a non-certification
alternative to the H-2A program.  </tt><p>
<tt>Two of the key allies of the growers in that battle still influence
immigration policy--Leon Panetta, who led the fight for the growers in the
House, is President Clinton's chief of staff, and Clinton reportedly assured
California farmers in September 1995 that "they would be taken care of" if
labor shortages developed.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson, in an August session with the California Farm Bureau,
asserted that he had not changed his position since the mid-1980s, when he
persuaded the US Senate to include the Wilson amendment in immigration reform
legislation. Had it been enacted, the Wilson program would have allowed foreign
farm workers to move freely from farm to farm in the US.  An incentive for
their eventual return to Mexico would have been provided according to Wilson,
by  withholding  one-third of their wages for payment when they had gone
home.</tt><p>
<tt>Wilson said it has been difficult to sell such a guest worker program
because of public confusion between illegal immigrants and guest workers.  As a
former presidential candidate, Wilson said that he would expand the US Border
Patrol to reduce illegal immigration, and push to have a guest worker program
instituted.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator John Kyl (R-AZ) and Representative Elton Gallegly (R-CA) are making
the case for growers in 1995 immigration reforms.  President Clinton, the CIR
headed by Barbara Jordan, and Senator Simpson and Representative Lamar Smith
(R-TX) are opposed to an new guest worker program for agriculture.</tt><p>
<tt>Many commentators have urged Congress to approve a guest worker program.
Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity, argued that "A guest-worker
program would allow the United States to benefit from the needed labor of
foreign-born workers without entitling them to the myriad social and welfare
benefits that has caused so much resentment in states like California while
reducing illegal immigration."</tt><p>

Reform and
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On September 19, the US Senate approved by a vote of 87 to 12 a welfare
reform bill that would end welfare payments to poor persons after two years,
and limit lifetime welfare payments to any individual to five years.  The House
welfare reform plan is tougher, denying both cash aid to teenage mothers, and
increased payments to mothers who have more children while receiving payments.
The Senate plan gives states the option to cutoff such benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the House and the Senate reforms deny most federal means-tested aid to
non-US citizens, but the Senate bar applies only to immigrants who arrive after
the welfare reform goes into effect.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants must show that they have sufficient resources so that they will
not become a "public charge" in the US, or have a US-resident sponsor sign an
affidavit that he/she will support the immigrant so that the immigrant does not
have to apply for welfare benefits.  The welfare reform makes these affidavits
legally binding, and "deems" the immigrant to have access to the income and
assets of the sponsor when authorities calculate whether an immigrant applicant
for welfare qualifies for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants advocates, such as the National Council of La Raza, decried the
measure saying that not only would it bar many legal immigrants from receiving
government assistance, it may deny support even after they are US citizens.
They argue that the bill would create a "second-class citizen," who would be
treated differently because they were not born in the US.  The immigration
advocates object to a provision in the bill which would require sponsors to
support an immigrant even after they become US citizens. </tt><p>
<tt>California is projected to lose $2 billion annually in federal welfare
payments if the Senate version of welfare reform is enacted, and 70 percent of
the reduction in federal payments to California is a result of the bar on
non-US citizens receiving welfare payments.</tt><p>
<tt>House Republicans are attempting to reduce eligibility for and the amount
of the Earned Income Tax Credit.  In one study, about one-fourth of the
benefits paid were fraudulent--some involved immigrants claiming more children
than they had.</tt><p>
<tt>The EITC was first enacted in 1975, and significantly expanded in 1986,
1990, and 1993.  It provides the working poor with $0.07 to $0.40 for each
dollar earned.  This means that a household head earning $4.25 can get an
earned income tax credit of up to $2 per hour in extra take-home pay ($0.40 for
every $1 earned up to $8,900).  A family with two or more children, and an
earned income of less than $25,000, could receive a maximum $2,500 check in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 4.5 million US residents will have their incomes lifted above
the poverty line by the EITC in 1995.  About 35 percent of US families with
children apply for the credit each year--in 1995, the IRS had paid about $21
billion on 18 million claims.  A disproportionately large number of newcomers
are recipients of the credits; thus areas with large numbers of immigrants
would be disproportionately affected.</tt><p>

Sweatshops</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On September 12, the US Department of Labor held a "summit" with garment
industry leaders and retailers in New York to discuss labor law violations in
the $89 billion garment industry.  The New York hearing featured women employed
in sweatshops telling Labor Secretary Robert Reich about how little they were
paid for long hours of work.</tt><p>
<tt>Reich also met with 15 major retailers to discuss how better to enforce
labor laws in the shops that sew the garments they sell.  One suggestion was to
include adherence to the Fair Labor Standards Act in the contracts that flow
from retailers and designers through intermediaries to the sewing shops--DOL
has only 900 investigators nationwide to enforce the nation's basic minimum
wage and child labor laws.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 22,000 sewing shops nationwide employing one million workers,
including an estimated 140,000 mostly Latino and Asian workers--80 percent
women-- who are employed in 5,000 legal sewing shops and 1,000 sweatshops that
operate without authorization in California.  There are estimated to be 4,500
sewing shops employing 50,000 workers in New York City.</tt><p>
<tt>El Monte was the Los Angeles area city in which the Thai slave sweatshop
was discovered in August 1995.  Local officials argue that a sweatshop could
have been found in any working class city in the Los Angeles area.  El Monte's
population of  110,000 is 60 percent Latino and 25 percent Asian.</tt><p>
<tt>A review of the evolution of the Los Angeles economy argues that the Los
Angeles labor market experienced two subtractions and one addition that add up
to a two-tier economy and society.  The subtractions were the loss of consumer
durables in the early 1980s, and the loss of aerospace and defense jobs in the
early 1990s.  The addition were low-wage jobs, as illustrated by sewing jobs,
and the fact that, in the 1990 Census, the South Central Los Angeles
congressional district replaced the Mississippi Delta as having the lowest per
capita income in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A review of the INS efforts to enforce employer sanctions, and thereby
prevent situations such as the Thai slavery sweatshop, criticized the agency
for failing to follow up on tips as early as 1988 that Thai workers may have
been held against their will in the apartment complex.  </tt><p>
<tt>DOL enforcement has also failed to ensure compliance.  A DOL inspection on
September 15, 1995 of 50 registered sewing shops in Los Angeles found
violations in 46.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai slave case prompted a review of other cases of immigrant smuggling
and exploitation.  A raid on a New York brothel found a madam "buying" Thai
women for $6,000 to $15,000 each, and then requiring the women to repay her by
having sex with men--the $100 paid by each man was kept by the madam; the
prostitute received only tips.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan also faces a problem with Thai women who have been sold as
prostitutes to work in Japanese brothels.  Women's activist organizations say
that there are up to 50,000 Thai women working as prostitutes in Japan.  Most
of the women have been bought for as much as $200,000 from Thai recruiters or
members of Japan's underworld, the yakuza. </tt><p>
<tt>On September 19, three Chinese men were arrested in California for killing
a Chinese immigrant in New York whose family in China had failed to pay the
ransom demanded.  According to authorities, the kidnappers were part of the
Fujianese Flying Dragons, a gang that specializes in kidnapping female Chinese
immigrants in the US and demanding that their families in China pay
ransom.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">INS
</a></a>Evaluates Gatekeeper,
</a>SouthPAW</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper, a $46 million
operation to halt illegal immigration on the five westernmost miles of the 24
mile-border south of San Diego with a fence, lights, and three lines of agents.
</tt><p>
<tt>One year later, the INS is reporting that Gatekeeper "worked."
Apprehensions in the five-mile sector were down 40 percent to 114,460 in
FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>However, apprehensions in the entire 24-mile San Diego sector were up 14
percent to 512,000, and critics assert that the sector-wide increase in
apprehensions simply shows that controlling the border is like squeezing a
balloon--concentrated efforts at one point simply transfer the aliens further
east.  Those who interview Mexicans attempting to cross, or Mexicans illegally
in the US, report that relatively few are discouraged by smugglers fees that
have risen by $100 or more from previous levels of $200 to $300.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS counters that, as it strengthens the next 19 miles of border
fencing and add agents eastward, illegal aliens will be pushed further east,
and smuggling fees will rise to prohibitive levels.  Some smugglers who have to
drive the extra miles east from Tijuana to Tecate complain that it just takes a
little longer to make a few extra bucks. </tt><p>
<tt>Many believe that the best way to evaluate Gatekeeper is by determining
whether unauthorized workers continue to arrive and find jobs inside the US, or
whether Mexicans considering illegal entry in rural Mexico are discouraged from
attempting to cross into the US.  By these criteria, the ability of Gatekeeper
to keep unauthorized workers out of the US is more mixed.</tt><p>
<tt>Reports from the single most labor-intensive activity in North American
agriculture--the harvest of about 200,000 acres of raisin grapes around Fresno,
California from mid-August to October--found that newly arrived workers are
getting into the US and going to work despite Gatekeeper.  </tt><p>
<tt>Unauthorized workers report that, after several apprehensions in the San
Diego sector, they succeeded in entering the US further east, and that
smugglers' fees rose from $200-$300 to $300-$400.  In addition, workers noted
that they lost days of work in the US because of delays in crossing the border.
Most seem to have persisted until they succeeded in reaching the Fresno
area.</tt><p>
<tt>Informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70 percent of them
succeed in entering the US illegally on their first try.  Surveys of aliens in
Mexico find that, even though most of those planning to enter the US illegally
know about Gatekeeper, the INS operation is not deterring them from planning to
attempt illegal entry.</tt><p>
<tt>Several southern California congressmen want the INS to build a triple
fence at the San Diego border, with paved border roads in between lines of
fence to prevent digging.  The House Judiciary Committee voted 17-11 to build
the triple fence south of San Diego.  </tt><p>
<tt>The same congressmen also wants the INS to close its interior checkpoints
on Highways 5 and 15 that tries to prevent aliens who elude the Border Patrol
from reaching Los Angeles, and move the agents to the border.  The INS
disagrees, and the Senate on September 12 disagreed with the House and provided
the INS with funds to operate its inland checkpoints.</tt><p>
<tt>Gatekeeper is part of a $540 million crackdown on illegal immigration
announced in February 1994 that has nearly doubled the number of Border Patrol
agents to 4,500.  The INS will have a $2.6 billion budget in FY96, its
highest-ever budget.</tt><p>
<tt>Many believe that the INS should devote more resources to interior
enforcement to prevent unauthorized workers from obtaining US jobs.  On
September 26, the INS announced that Operation SouthPAW (PAW - Protecting
America's Workers) had removed 4,000 unauthorized workers--almost 90 percent
Mexicans--in 31 days of coordinated inspections by DOL and INS investigators in
June and September--from 300 US firms in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas,
Georgia, Alabama and Florida.</tt><p>
<tt>One-third of the illegal workers were found in Georgia, and one-fourth in
Arkansas.  Follow-up surveys by the INS found that local residents filled over
half of the jobs from which illegal aliens were removed.  Some employers were
re-inspected, and ten were fined the maximum $15,000 for continuing to employ
illegal alien workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker questioned the significance of
apprehending 600 illegal workers in his state when Tyson Foods alone employs
20,000. Tyson Foods said inspections were disruptive, and the INS apprehended
only 73 workers.  According to Tyson, only 40 jobs were then opened up for
legal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Simmons Foods, a company that has worked closely with the INS to learn how
to detect false documents, had six illegal workers in a work force of 650.
Simmons officials said they would like to find a better way to check documents
to eliminate the need for INS inspections. </tt><p>
<tt>If the cost of the enforcement team was $100 per inspector per day, then
the total cost of Operation SouthPAW would have been about $3 million, implying
a cost of about $750 to open each job that paid an average $14,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The raids have brought fear to illegal immigrants in towns throughout the
South.  After Operation Gulf Sweep in Texas, there were reports that in some
towns, streets  and stores were empty because immigrants were afraid they would
be picked up on the street by INS.  One woman said she even gave up
babysitting, and the $75 per week she earned from it, because she was afraid
she would be picked up in the raids. </tt><p>
<tt>Grupo Beta is Mexico's US-trained border police unit, that some US
officials claim is working with the INS to help contain illegal immigration.
Grupo Beta was formed in 1991 to protect migrants from crime, and it is only in
1995 that some in the US government are calling the unit a Mexican effort to
stop illegal immigration.  The border unit is not permitted to stop Mexican
citizens from crossing the border because of their constitutional right to
freedom of movement.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS until mid-September required airlines bringing passengers to the US
without visas to pay for the cost of detaining them if they requested asylum.
INS procedures require the detention of individuals without documents seeking
asylum, but a New York court ruled that the INS could not force the airlines to
pay for detention costs.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will pay for detention costs in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont,
but in other states, airlines will remain responsible for detention
costs.</tt><p>

<tt>Despite the loss of one million jobs so far in 1995, unemployed Mexicans
have not taken to the streets in protest.  According to observers, social peace
has been maintained by extended family support systems, and by the opening of
the Mexican political system to accommodate protest.  </tt><p>
<tt>Inflation is running at 50 percent, and real wages are falling.  One way
many families survive is to send a family member to the US to earn dollars that
are worth 50 percent more in Mexico in 1995 than they were in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In November 1993, President Clinton predicted that NAFTA would add 200,000
US jobs in 1995.  Critics have noted that, as of August 1995, the US Department
of Labor had certified that 38,000 US workers had lost their jobs due to
increased imports from Mexico, and that another 30,000 US workers had applied
for assistance, asserting that NAFTA had caused them to be laid off.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has returned to foreign borrowers for loans, touting the fact that
the country ran $3 billion trade surplus in the first half of 1995.  However,
unemployment is up, and the economy is expected to shrink by five to six
percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Economist Sidney Weintraub finds that one year after its implementation,
NAFTA has been less significant than proponents expected, and more profound
that those who believed an economic union was inevitable.  Weintraub argues
that after the peso devaluation, without NAFTA, there would not have been
similar pressure on the US to bail out Mexico with International Monetary Fund
help. </tt><p>
<tt>As trade between the US and Mexico increases, there has been a push to
create a NAFTA superhighway along US 35 and Mexico 85, connecting the American
midwest with Mexico City, so that a truck could travel from Chicago to Mexico
City within 36 hours.  Under the plan, trucks would be sealed inside each
country, and then be waved through the border crossing in Laredo, Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 419 million legal crossings over the Mexico-US border south of
San Diego in FY94, and frustration is mounting as US border inspectors do more
careful inspections to deal with drugs and illegal immigration.  As a result,
waits to cross the border can be 3 to 4 hours, and Tijuana shoppers have
reported reduced the $2.6 billion they usually spend in the US because of
difficulty in crossing the border.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most observers say that the INS needs to add more inspectors.  Inspectors
now are expected to check vehicles entering the US at the rate of 1 every 30
seconds.  Some have proposed a commuter lane for some of the 40,000 daily
Mexican workers employed in the US, in which electronic devices would screen
vehicles of persons for whom background checks had been completed.  This
system, already in place on the Canadian border, is resisted on the Mexican
border because of fears of corruption.</tt><p>

<tt>The New York City Central Labor Council has committed $200,000 to train 100
organizers to recruit immigrant workers into unions.  According to union
leaders, many immigrants work 72 hours for $250 weekly, which is less than the
$4.25 minimum hourly wage.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration has endorsed the call for an increase in the
minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>In many immigrant neighborhoods, there are many more check cashing
establishments and pawn shops than bank branches.  It has been observed that
many immigrants, finding it hard to get loans in the US, have resorted to
banking arrangements that they used in their countries of origin.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of these informal banking arrangements make borrowed money very
expensive.  Interest rates from so-called loan sharks are as high as six
percent per week.</tt><p>
<tt>The Service Employees International Union, the largest union in California
with 300,000 members, is protesting job cutbacks in Los Angeles county--most of
the jobs eliminated are held by SEIU members.  The SEIU is asking the federal
and state governments to provide more funds to Los Angeles county to avoid
layoffs.</tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the SEIU's 1.1 million members nationwide are in the
public sector, and about 40 percent of US union members are public employees.
The SEIU has become famous for its confrontational tactics--its Justice for
Janitors campaign, for example, involved picketing household-name firms that
employed non-union janitors through contractors.  Such tactics have been
successful--the percentage of Los Angeles janitors in unions has risen from
about 10 percent in 1987 to 90 percent in 1995.</tt><p>

Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The percentage of US residents who change their residences every year has
fallen from about 1 in 5 to 1 in 6.  Americans are also staying closer to home
when they move--the percentage of Americans who moved from one state to another
was only 2.6 percent in the year ending March 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Several factors contribute to the decline in internal migration, from an
aging population to two-income families to financial insecurity.  Hispanics
were most likely to move; whites least likely.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 1.2 million persons moved to the US from abroad between March
1993 and March 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, California had no net
immigration--foreign plus domestic combined-- in 1994, for the first time in
the 20th century.  Indeed, after gaining 414,000 people via migration in 1989,
California lost a net 426,000 residents via domestic migration in 1994, and a
total of 1.1 million more Californians left California than entered from other
states since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>UCLA nonetheless projects that net immigration to California will top
100,000 by the year 2000, largely because employment and income growth are
expected to once again top national rates, but not by as much as in the 1980s.
For example, there were 315,000 building permits issued in California in 1986,
versus less than 100,000 per year in the 1990s, helping to explain why housing
prices fell especially in Los Angeles country, which accounts for about 25
percent of California's population, and why governments there are strapped for
tax revenues.</tt><p>
<tt>Most analyses find that it is lack of jobs in California, not the declining
quality of life, that encourages more US residents to leave than enter
California.  California's unemployment rate of 7.8 percent in August 1995 was
2.2 percent higher than the US rate.</tt><p>
<tt>California's population, 32.5 million in mid-1995, is expected to be 43.3
million in 2000, and 42.5 million in 2015.  This is a 30 percent population
increase, versus a 50 percent increase between 1975 and 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Census estimates based on IRS tax returns, New York also lost
over one million residents to other states between 1991 and 1994, Illinois lost
230,000, New Jersey lost 185,000, and Massachusetts lost 170,000.  Florida
gained a net 500,000 residents via internal migration, Texas, 242,000; and
Arizona, 200,000.</tt><p>

<tt>On September 27, the House Judiciary Committee approved an amendment to the
immigration bill that would create a new refugee category for women who are
threatened with forced abortion or sterilization.  The new category of refugees
is limited to 1,000 women each year.</tt><p>
<tt>In early June, the INS issued new guidelines that permit foreign women to
seek asylum in the US because they face gender-based persecution in their
country of citizenship.  The US joins Canada as the second nation that
recognizes gender-based persecution as the basis for granting asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that the new INS rule might produced 800 to 1,000 more
applications per year.</tt><p>
<tt>About 80 percent of the world's 24 million refugees are women and children
but asylum has most often been granted to men persecuted for their political
activities.  In some cases, women who joined husbands seeking asylum in the US
apply for asylum for themselves on the grounds that their husbands abuse
them.</tt><p>
<tt>INS offices report fewer asylum applicants in 1995.  In Miami, for example,
asylum applications have fallen almost 60 percent, from 1,400 per month to 600
per month.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>In 1994, 147,605 aliens applied for asylum in the US--8,254

<tt>Job growth patterns resemble immigration patterns--the fastest growth is at
the extremes of the distribution.  One result is that income is more unequally
distributed than at any time in the past 50 years.</tt><p>
<tt>In August 1995, there were 125 million workers employed in the US labor

earnings, and found that job growth was concentrated at the top and bottom of
the wage distribution.  Almost 30 percent of net new jobs were in occupations
that paid wages that were in the top 25 percent, and almost 30 percent were in
the bottom 25 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>There were relatively few new jobs created in the middle ranges of the
earnings distribution, jobs that pay about $7.50 per hour, $300 per week,
$1,200 per month, and $15,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a total of 40 million new jobs created between 1983 and 1993,
yielding net job growth of 20 million.  About 60 percent of these 40 million
new jobs required little education and training, such as fast food worker and
janitor and cleaner.  This fact helps to explain why the real earnings of males
with only a high school education fell 30 percent between 1973 and 1993, and
why 30-year old high school graduates who were 30 in 1972 saw their real
earnings decline 20 percent by 1992, even though they were getting older and
presumably more experienced.</tt><p>
<tt>According to DOL data, the lowest paid 10 percent of all US full-time
workers earned an average $225 per week, or $900 per month, with no fringe
benefits, in 1992.  A woman with two children on welfare receives an average
$400 per month, plus about $300 in Food Stamps, and usually free health care
and housing and transportation assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>There is some downward mobility in the US labor force, in the sense that
over 20 percent of the production workers in manufacturing in 1994 attended
college, and 71 percent were high school graduates.  Both figures are up
sharply from 14 and 40 percent in 1984.  Better-educated workers are willing to
do factory work because wages and benefits can give them higher wages than
traditional white-collar jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Most explanations for these labor market and earnings patterns begin with
supply and demand.  The demand for highly educated workers rose sharply in the
1980s, putting upward pressure on their earnings, while foreign competition and
technology reduced the demand for unskilled workers, putting downward pressure
on earnings at the bottom of the labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>The well-educated immigrants entering the top of the labor market have not
slowed earnings growth there appreciably, but the influx of less educated
immigrants has probably contributed to slow earnings growth at the bottom of
the labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US-born persons with less than college education's are leaving
California, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey
--states where 80 percent of all immigrants settle--producing what has been
called the "demographic balkanization of the United States ."  Between 1990 and
1994, Los Angeles gained 663,000 immigrants and had a net loss of 848,000
native-born residents, while New York City gained 568,000 immigrants and lost
861,000 native residents.</tt><p>
<tt>If current immigration and internal migration patterns persist, some
demographers project that the US could have 11 states in which the minority
population is more than 40 percent of the total population, while 13 states
would have white, non-Hispanic populations greater than 85 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, immigrants starting at the bottom of the job ladder
succeeded in climbing up the job ladder.  A profile of several immigrants who
moved up the job ladder in Chicago-area McDonald's emphasized that the
fast-food chain has adapted its training materials to Spanish-speaking workers,
and can make entry-level workers productive with only a few hours of
instruction.</tt><p>
<tt>McDonald's has about 500,000 employees in the US and Canada, and every year
hires over one million new employees, i.e., turnover is more than 100 percent.
It has been estimated that about 20 million of the 160 million Americans who
have worked in the US labor market over the past 40 years--one in eight--was
employed at some point by a McDonald's.</tt><p>
<tt>McDonald's provides immigrants with the opportunity to learn business
basics.  Management training takes place both on the job, and in regional and
national training centers. </tt><p>
<tt>Most stories about immigration, trade, and US workers focus on the bottom
rungs of the labor market, where US workers typically have less than a high
school diploma, or, in extended analyses, up to a high school diploma.  But an
August 28 story in the New York Times pointed out that the same technologies
that permit multinational firms to hire local workers to process everything
from airline tickets to grocery store coupons overseas also permit firms to
have more sophisticated tasks done overseas, such as computer
programming.</tt><p>
<tt>Multinationals favor moving to or creating jobs in countries with lots of
engineers, English and low wages.  India fits the bill for many computer
firms--an estimated 75,000 Indians are programming for US firms in India, at
monthly wages of less than $1500, compared to $5000 in the US.  Bangalore, a
city of three million in the south of India, is that country's Silicon
Valley.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, about 23 million or 20 percent of average US employment of 120
million were part-time workers, defined as being employed less than 35 hours
each week.  About two-thirds of these temporary workers voluntarily wanted to
work less than a full or 40 hour work week; the other one-third were
involuntary part-timers who wanted more hours of work.  </tt><p>
<tt>A survey of large US firms found that, in 1 in 5, so-called contingent
workers--temporaries, part-timers, and independent contractors--were 10 percent
or more of their labor forces.</tt><p>
<tt>The average number of hours of work of nonsupervisory production workers
has been falling, from 37 hours per week in 1970 to 34.5 hours per week in
1993.  The 20 million workers in retail trade in 1993 averaged just 29 hours
per week in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Some hope that unions can raise the wages of workers at the bottom of the
US labor market.  There are 17 million union members in the US labor force,
including 13 million in unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO, meaning that 1 in 6
US workers is a union member, down from 1 in 3 in 1960.  About 10 million of
these workers are in the private sector, meaning that about 10 percent of all
private sector workers are union members, and 7 million are in the public
sector, meaning that 39 percent of public sector workers are in unions.</tt><p>
<tt>Unions are devoting significantly more resources to organizing especially
unskilled service workers and immigrants, including garbage collectors, poultry
processing workers, and golf course workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In July, Guatemalan immigrant poultry processing workers voted 238-183 to
have the Laborers International Union represent them at a North Carolina
poultry processing plant, after a mid-May spontaneous strike to protest having
to ask permission to go to the bathroom.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, in California, the United Farm Workers has so far been unable to
turn a 1994 election victory at a Gallo vineyard into a first contract, a
reminder that organizing elections does not always lead to contracts with
higher wages, a reminder that organizing may be necessary to add union members,
but winning elections is not enough to assure collective bargaining
agreements.</tt><p>
<tt>Both candidates to head the AFL-CIO have pledged to spend up to one-third
of the organization's $60 million annual budget on organizing.  </tt><p>
<tt>In New York, garment industry employment fell from 260,000 in 1961 to
80,000 in 1995.  These 80,000 mostly immigrant employees are scattered across
1,000 mostly small firms, and they generate $14 billion in annual sales.
</tt><p>
<tt>The immigrant entrepreneurs who own many small businesses in inner cities
reportedly prefer to hire other immigrants rather than US-citizen Blacks.  The
tendency of minority immigrant entrepreneurs to avoid hiring members of the
largest minority in the US is yet another obstacle for Blacks seeking
entry-level jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Interviews with immigrant business entrepreneurs find that they believe
immigrant workers are more reliable, have the "right attitude," and are less
likely to file complaints with labor law and other authorities.  Network
hiring, in which current employees bring their friends and relatives to fill
vacant jobs, eliminate many costs of recruitment and training while providing
high quality employees, since co-workers are only likely to bring into the
workplace new workers who will be dependable.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants, even those that benefit from affirmative action preferences,
reportedly feel little obligation to overcome historic discrimination against
Blacks.  Jobs that were once filled by Blacks, such as in hotels and
restaurants in Los Angeles, are today filled primarily by immigrants in cities
such as Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 17 million US households spent $12.5 billion on landscape and
lawn services in 1993, including $5.6 billion on basic lawn mowing and
fertilizing.  Basic lawn service expenditures are growing by six percent per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Many "lawn-service businesses" begin with an investment of a few hundred
dollars, and the distribution of hand bills.  Turnover is high, in part because
of "cutthroat" competition from new entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>By the year 2020, between 25 and 30 percent of the residents of industrial
nations such as the US, Germany, and Japan will be 60 or older--the share of
older residents is highest in non-immigrant Japan.  According to the OECD, the
unfunded Social Security liability of the US is over 40 percent of the
country's GDP, meaning that the US should put aside about $2.8 trillion so that
it can earn interest to pay today's levels of pensions and health care benefits
to future retirees without raising tax rates.  In Germany, by contrast, about
1.6 times the current GDP should be set aside, and in Japan, twice the current
GDP should be set aside today.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US companies are complaining of labor shortages. The Wall Street
Journal profiled the problems of Lincoln Electric, a manufacturer of welding
equipment, in finding workers who knew basic math, were willing to learn more,
and would come to work regularly.  According to the company, most of the 26,000
applications submitted over the past 18 months were rejected because the
applicants did not have basic math skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Some observers believe that low wages and a poor image keep many of the
applicants that manufacturers would like to hire from applying for jobs.  Most
of the high school graduates with math skills go to college, and there are
recruited for white-collar jobs that offer the potential for much higher
earnings.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Muslims
In France</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Since the first bomb exploded in Paris on July 25, French police have
stopped an average of over 100,000 mostly Muslim-appearing residents each week
to check their documents.  There are about five million Muslims in France,
including two million ethnic Algerians.  About half of these Muslims are
foreigners, and half are French nationals.  In the US, by contrast, there are
about six million Muslims.</tt><p>
<tt>The wave of attacks is similar to assaults during Algeria's war of
independence from 1954 to 1962.  During that struggle, 6,000 Algerians and 400
French lost their lives in France. </tt><p>
<tt>There is some discussion about whether random police checks represent
discrimination against Muslims and Africans.  Most established Muslim leaders
and organizations have condemned the bombings, and not complained too loudly
about the police checks.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, many North Africans complain that police checks of Arab-looking
residents constitute discrimination.  Some Arab merchants asserted that the
security crackdown has hurt their business.  Most French residents reportedly
approve of street checks, the same strategy that was used to deal with a
similar wave of bombings in 1986.</tt><p>
<tt>Officials believe the current attacks are meant to stop the French
government from supporting the Algerian government.  Others think that the
attacks are meant to encourage immigrants in France to pay "revolutionary
taxes."  During the Algerian war of independence, Algerians in France were
"encouraged" to pay about 25 percent of earnings to Algerian nationalists to
support the struggle for liberation.</tt><p>
<tt>Government officials say fundamentalists recruit jobless immigrant youth in
suburban housing developments--vast blocks of apartment buildings dotted with
satellite dishes that pick up television shows from Morocco, Algeria and
Tunisia that allegedly inspire youth to support fundamentalist regimes in North
Africa.  </tt><p>
<tt>One Algerian-born historian, Benjamin Stora, disagrees, saying that most of
the Algerians plan to remain in France.  Their children are born in France, and
many do not speak Arabic, and are not fundamentalist Muslims.  It is the new
generation of French Muslims, according to Stora, who feel that France does not
want them so they rejected France.  The young French Muslim who was accused of
the recent spat of bombings in France was a member of this alienated part of
society. </tt><p>
<tt>Other social scientists say that the spread of Islam in the Paris suburbs
represents an effort by young people to put order in their lives through
religion.  For those isolated by or excluded by society, Islam gives a center
of reference.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to sociologists, Islam began to grow in the late 1980s when
second-generation immigrants realized that their social and economic
integration was impossible in a society that would not refuse to accept them as
equals.  There has been a growing backlash against the newcomers as high
unemployment persists.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the Algerians who have been in France for 30 years and have
children who were born in France have chosen to leave the door open to both
France and Algeria.  But many French officials believe that integration into
French society means adopting French language and culture.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some French say there can be no "melting pot."  One mayor of a community
with a large immigrant population banned satellite dishes that could receive
North African programs, saying that he did not want to transform France into a
nation of the Maghreb.</tt><p>
<tt>Recent immigrants often find themselves stranded in housing developments in
Paris suburbs such as Montfermeil, with no direct transportation to Paris,
little industry, and few jobs. The apartment complex of Los Bosquets, which
occupies three percent of the town's area, has 20 percent of its 20,000
population--most of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants.
Unemployment is 25 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The gray concrete buildings of Los Bosquets and other housing complexes
through Pair suburbs are covered with graffiti and satellite dishes.  Some of
the women at Los Bosquets have organized a group to assist new immigrants
better understand French society and integrate.  But the young men remain
isolated; resorting to drugs and petty crime.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners found without papers are repatriated, some via weekly "charter"
flights that carry about 50 people and cost the government between $8,000 and
$16,000.  Escorted by the police and a doctor, the plane puddle jumps across
Africa, dropping off illegal immigrants in their countries of origin.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government plans to double the number of illegal immigrants expelled
via charter to 15,000 in 1995, and 24,000 in 1996.  For political and legal
reasons, expulsion is difficult--there are 60,000 illegals found each year, yet
only one quarter of them are expelled.  Detention centers will be expanded,
although the government is allowed to hold illegal aliens for only 10 days.
</tt><p>
<tt>France requires Algerians to obtain visas to come to France, and the number
of Algerians applying for visas to visit France fell from 800,000 during the
first eight months of 1989 to 80,000 in 1995.  Many Algerians reportedly do not
apply for visas because they believe that their applications for visas to visit
France will be rejected.</tt><p>
<tt>President Chirac on September 5 threatened to suspend France's
participation in the Schengen agreement that eliminates border controls between
seven EU countries if neighbors such as Germany do not step up their efforts to
stop terrorists from entering their countries, and thus gaining free entry to
France.  The Schengen agreement went into effect in March 1995 among six of the
seven countries; France is currently scheduled to abolish border controls with
Schengen partners in January 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Belgium and the Netherlands criticized France for threatening to delay the
abolition of border controls.  Belgian officials, for example, assert that
French police no longer have full control over the city of Lille, and criminals
from there cross the border to commit crimes in Belgium.</tt><p>
<tt>Other EU countries were more muted in their criticisms.  Since the Schengen
agreement went into effect, it is reported that immigration inspectors are
checking entrants more carefully, and that non-Schengen countries such as
Sweden and Britain are checking entrants from Schengen countries more
carefully.</tt><p>

<tt>On September 21, the European Parliament, based in Strasbourg, France,
voted for a series of minimal safeguards for asylum seekers in member states.
The Parliament called for asylum seekers whose requests have been denied to
have the automatic right of appeal.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Parliament also asked for the establishment of an EC Bureau to monitor
population shifts, and to issue a list of safe third countries.  At an EU
summit meeting in October, the Parliament will press for a common definition of
refugee to include all persecuted people, including those who are victims of
fundamentalist groups.  Sexual violence against women, said the Parliament,
should be regarded as a legitimate reason for granting asylum. </tt><p>
<tt>On September 25, the European Union agreed on a list of 100 countries whose
citizens will need a visa to enter the 15-bloc nation.  </tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR has asked all nations to accept more refugees from the former
Yugoslavia.  There are reports that the US will take in 25,000 more should it
become necessary, and the UNHCR requested that the EU offer to take the other
25,000 refugees in the contingency reserve. </tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Europe, an organization of 39 governments in Europe founded
in 1949, held a three-day meeting September 20-23 in Cyprus to discuss how to
accelerate development and thus reduce emigration pressures.  The conference
was attended by government leaders, academics and business officials.  The
council working to develop economic, environmental and cultural cooperation
between the richer northern Mediterranean and the poorer southern
region.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of African nations complained that there were too few
southern Mediterranean officials attending the conference-- most of the 250
delegates came from northern countries. </tt><p>
<tt>From Turkey in the east to Morocco in the west are some 200 million people
who live on annual incomes of up to 15 times less than European nations.
According to one official, this unequal economic development will lead to
instability in both the southern countries and Europe.  At the conclusion of
the conference, officials said that the Mediterranean should not become a
barrier between rich and poor, and urged northern countries to assist with the
economic development of the south. </tt><p>
<tt>The final report noted that "the increasing migration due to demographic
and socioeconomic imbalances, further exacerbated by the growth of
fundamentalist tendencies and the inadequacy of political structures in some of
the countries concerned" is of grave concern on both sides of the
Mediterranean.</tt><p>
<tt>Prior to the conference, the head of the council's Commission on
Environment and Land Management said that Europe can no long economically
sustain large-scale immigration from North Africa and Middle Eastern countries.
One way to assist the governments of those countries, the commissioner said,
would be to control population growth and accelerate economic development.
</tt><p>
<tt>A second conference is scheduled for Italy in 1996 to draft an action plan
on immigration, racism and xenophobia.  According to some observers, the fall
of communism has allowed the "green threat" of Islam to replace the "red
threat" of communism.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Union member states plan to discuss migration with the North
African nations that have EU association agreements November 27-28, 1995 in
Barcelona.  The EU is expected to pledge to help to reduce migratory pressures
by promoting job creation in countries of origin, including supplementing the
investment of remittances of migrants living in EU states in their countries of
origin, and is asking North African countries to cooperate to reduce illegal
immigration, and to accept the return of nationals caught illegally in EU
states. </tt><p>
<tt>There are 18 million unemployed workers in the 15 nation EU, and no
reduction in unemployment is foreseen before 1997.</tt><p>

<tt>The number of asylum seekers fell in nine major European countries in 1994.
In Germany, asylum seekers fell by 60 percent, in Belgium by 46 percent, in
Sweden by 50 percent and in Denmark by 53 percent.  Holland, Germany, Norway
and Spain all set up detention camps and limited welfare claims to asylum
seekers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands expects about 25,000 asylum applications in 1995, down 50
percent from the 53,000 in 1994.  Asylum procedures were tightened in 1994, and
far fewer applicants are given full A-refugee status.</tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands Equal Employment for Foreigners Act (WBEAA) requires Dutch
companies with more than 35 employees to report the number of foreign workers
they employ by June 1, 1995, but there is no penalty for non-compliance.  The
purpose of registration is to promote the employment of foreigners living in
the country; only two percent of the employers had reported by June 1.  Denmark
considered and rejected a similar employment-reporting requirement.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 52,000 asylum applications in the Netherlands in 1994, and the
Dutch government responded by building three detention centers, and 13 more
centers where applicants can come and go freely while staying for up to three
months.  Asylum applicants are prohibited from working.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, 50,000 foreigners--half of them Turks-- became naturalized Dutch
citizens.  One third of the new Dutch citizens were born in the Netherlands of
foreign parents.</tt><p>
<tt>The Dutch have threatened to stop paying workers compensation to some
persons abroad.  Some 2,700 Moroccans are drawing benefits as a result of
injuries suffered in the Netherlands, and Moroccan doctors have certified 100
percent of those examined as too sick to travel to the Netherlands for second
opinions, and still in need of benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>A bill has been introduced into the Dutch Parliament that would deny most
public services to illegal aliens.  If approved, illegal alien children would
still be able to attend Dutch schools, and obtain emergency medical
care.</tt><p>

Asylum Seekers and Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On September 22, Germany began to repatriate the 40,000 Vietnamese
scheduled to leave the country by the year 2000.  Persons involved in criminal
activities will be the first to be sent home.  Germany has committed $11
million to Vietnam for reintegration projects, the first payment of a $150
million return agreement.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the plan, $5.7 million dollars will be spent on job creation for the
returning Vietnamese, primarily by making low-interest loans available.  The
German contribution is part of the $142 million dollar package signed in July
for the repatriation of the Vietnamese living illegally in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 1,400 Vietnamese applied for asylum in Germany in the first six months
of 1995, but virtually none had their applications accepted.</tt><p>
<tt>There was a crisis in Bonn on September 12, when the Interior Minister
ordered the expulsion of seven Sudanese asylum seekers as soon as their appeals
were rejected.  The seven had arrived at Frankfurt airport in July, and applied
for asylum on the grounds that they faced persecution in the Sudan because they
were student members of a political group opposed to the government.  After
Stern magazine reported on September 20 that at least four of the claims were
false--the men were taxi drivers etc, and not politically active--planned
protests were called off.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers rose to 11,900 in August, bringing the total
for the first eight months of 1995 to 108,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany houses hundreds of asylum seekers on boats in the Hamburg harbor,
sometimes for a year or more.  Some Germans have complained that the boats are
floating concentration camps, while others observe that conditions on the boats
are far better than in most asylum seekers' countries of origin.</tt><p>
<tt>Asylum seekers held on the boats receive about $800 monthly for food and
clothing.  Many are allowed to work as e.g., janitors, but any wages earned
reduce their government payment.  </tt><p>
<tt>In many cases, groups fighting each other at home, such as Kurds and Turks,
live side by side on the boat, sometimes producing fights.</tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic German Aussiedler continue to arrive in Germany from the ex-USSR.
Some 400,000 Aussiedler arrived each year in 1989 and 1990, leading to
procedural changes and a quota that has kept arrivals since then to about
200,000 annually.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has begun 700 investigations of cases of EU and other foreign
worker employment on German construction sites.  Germany alleges that some
firms, especially British-owned companies, are quick to give their unemployed
workers E101 forms, which show that workers are self-employed, and thus
eligible to ply their trade anywhere in the EU.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin, currently the world's largest construction site, Russians and
Ukrainians were found working for $5 per hour.  In the Ruhr, British and Irish
workers were found working for half of the usual German wage of 65DM per hour,
including wages and fringe benefits.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the
80,000 British workers in Germany are drawing UI benefits in the UK while
working in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In most cases, Dutch agencies locate workers in the UK, fly them to the
Netherlands, and then bus them to Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>The German labor minister promised to introduce a bill that would require
German minimum wages to be paid to all workers, foreigners and local alike, in
20 construction occupations for at least two years.  However, the bill will not
be introduced until the various employer associations agree to support
it.</tt><p>
<tt>Metal employers oppose extending the higher minimum construction wage of
20DM per hour to their industry, where the minimum wage is 18DM.  Their
opposition may kill the proposal.</tt><p>
<tt>The German land, or state, of Saarland in September voted to give the
14,000 residents from the other 14 EU countries the right to vote in local
elections beginning in January 1995.  Baden-Wurttemberg and North
Rhine-Westphalia have also indicated that they will extend local voting rights
to EU residents.</tt><p>
<tt>The country most worried about high unemployment leading to a balkanized or
divided society is France, but Germany too is worried about jobless economic
growth.  According to employers, German unions resist granting employers the
flexibility they need to remain competitive, so many are establishing
production facilities abroad.  They point to the IG Metall union's dealings
with Volkswagen, in which the union resisted Volkswagen's calls for flexible
hours of work.</tt><p>
<tt>Some speculate that union-management confrontations in Germany are putting
the country on the same path as Britain in the late 1980s, when the British
government stepped in and weakened the power of unions to help employers get
work and wage flexibility.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Hong
Kong Residents Want UK Passports</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten on September 25 said that 3.3 million of
Hong Kong's 6.2 million residents should have the right to immigrate to the UK.
The British government immediately responded with a reaffirmation of its policy
that granted 50,000 heads of families the right to a full British passport and
nationality.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 3.3 million Hong Kong residents now hold the status of Hong Kong
British Dependent Territory citizen or British National, British passports that
do not guarantee the right to abode in Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>A Hong Kong legislator argued that racism prevents the British government
from permitting Hong Kong residents to immigrate.  The legislator pointed out
that people in the crown colonies of the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar have a
right to migrate to Britain.  Conservative British MP John Carlisle responded
that "Britain should not become a dumping ground for every traveling Chinaman."
</tt><p>
<tt>As 1997 approaches, there is a saying that there are only two things Hong
Kong people can do: the middle class can emigrate, and the others can riot.
</tt><p>
<tt>A Preliminary Working Committee was unable to decide whether children born
of illegal immigrants in Hong Kong should be given the right of permanent
residence.  Currently babies born in Hong Kong do not have automatic right of
abode unless the father has an unconditional right of residence in the
territory.  </tt><p>
<tt>Alleged corruption has reportedly encouraged expectant mothers to try to
illegally enter Hong Kong for their births. </tt><p>
<tt>On September 11, a truck with 10 pregnant illegal immigrants from Shenzhen
crashed through the Hong Kong-China border.  One hospital reported that 20
percent of its pregnant patients were from the mainland, including illegal
immigrants, two-way permit holders, and overstayers-- all wanted to have their
children born in Hong Kong.  </tt><p>
<tt>The women believed that since their unborn child had a Hong Kong father,
they would have a better chance of joining the father in Hong Kong after 1997
if they gave birth in Hong Kong.  The immigration department reports that 1,900
babies were born to illegal immigrant women in Hong Kong in the first eight
months of 1995, an increase of 30 percent over the same period last year.
</tt><p>
<tt>In the last three years, 25,000 mainland Chinese women gave birth in Hong
Kong, and 7,000 of those were mothers who illegally entered Hong Kong. </tt><p>
<tt>The governor of Hong Kong rejected a demand to halt the importation of
foreign workers in order to curb unemployment.  Unemployment is currently at
3.5 percent, an 11-year high.  The Democratic party, pro-China legislators and
the unions have demanded a ban on labor importation.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC26">Korea
Becomes the Land of Opportunity</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>During the 1980s, Korea was the third leading source of Asian immigrants to
the US--only the Philippines (549,000) and China-including Taiwan (347,000)
sent more immigrants to the US than Korea (334,000).</tt><p>
<tt>But during the 1990s, the number of Korean immigrants coming to the US has
dropped, to about 11,000 in 1994.  According to Koreans, the 1988 Olympic Games
showed expatriate Koreans that their country offered economic opportunity.
According to the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in each of the last four
years, between 5,000 and 6,500 people returned to Korea, compared with about
800 in 1980.</tt><p>
<tt>There are many reasons why Koreans are leaving the US to return to Korea.
Most begin with Korea's dramatic economic growth.  The demand-pull of
opportunity in Korea is matched by the frustration some Koreans feel in the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some Korean professionals believe that there is a glass ceiling in the US
that restricts their advancement here, while their bilingual skills increase
their opportunities in Korea.  Korean-Americans seem to be well accepted in
Korea--the governors of two of Korea's nine provinces recently were US
citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some observers believe that self-employed Koreans have saturated the market
for high-risk dry cleaners, vegetable stores, and liquor stores in the inner
cities of New York and Los Angeles, and are returning to Korea because they
cannot make money in the US.  Some Koreans who return say they never felt
comfortable with the casualness of American society and the English language.
</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign workers in Korea is on the rise.  According to the
Ministry of Labor, there were 6,475 legally employed foreign workers as of the
end of July, 1995, plus 34,931 foreigners in various types of work and learn
programs, and over 61,000 illegal foreign workers, making foreign workers just
under one percent of the 12.8 million workers in the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>Another 20,000 foreign workers are expected to enter vocational training
programs in Korea in September, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal foreign workers were concentrated in the fields of language
instruction, arts and culture, teachers, technicians, researchers and other
specialists.  Almost half of the "trainees" come from China.  Another 25,000
illegal foreign workers are from China, including 20,000 ethnic Koreans.

Concerned About Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The first guest workers arrived in Taiwan in 1990.  By 1995, there were
315,919 foreign workers, and they comprise about three percent of the labor
force.  Over 67 percent of the guest workers are in manufacturing. </tt><p>
<tt>Although the import of labor has kept labor costs low, there is increasing
concern about the social costs of foreign workers.  Some observers have said
that importing guest workers is only a temporary solution, and that the country
must increase its domestic supply of labor and decrease its demand for labor
through automation. </tt><p>
<tt>According to government reports, over 77 percent of Taiwan's
labor-intensive manufacturing enterprises, many with foreign workers, face
labor shortages.  The Council of Labor Affairs reported that Taiwanese
manufacturers received approval for 231,000 foreign workers at the end of 1994,
up 73 percent from one year earlier.  </tt><p>
<tt>The council now plans to extend employers' quotas to hire foreign workers
an extra six months.  Foreign workers will also be allowed to change employers.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Taiwan Textile Federation is working with the Chinese National
Federation of Industries to press for faster passage of the revised Vocational
Service Law, which would allow employers to extend the stay of individual
foreign workers from two years to three years.  The textile federation argues
that the two-year limit has resulted in foreign workers running away from their
employer during the last two months of their two-year contracts. </tt><p>
<tt>A survey of Taiwan workers by the Labor Department found that over half of
the workers in Taiwan province oppose the admission of Chinese mainland
workers.  Fourteen percent oppose the admission of all foreign workers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC28">Vietnamese
Returnees Find Little Persecution</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Stories about Vietnamese boat people who have been repatriated to Vietnam
tell of returning to a changed Vietnam.  Political freedom is nonexistent, yet
there is no longer the sense of hopelessness because of improved living
standards.  </tt><p>
<tt>Though many reported fearing a return to Vietnam, those who returned
reportedly soon realized that life was normal.  The UN High Commissioner for
Refugees and other relief agencies report no official persecution or harassment
of returnees. </tt><p>
<tt>The biggest problem many of the returnees face is seeing family members who
often forfeited their life savings to buy them passage on boats.  The UNHCR
repatriation grant of $440 per person helps--especially considering that the
average per capita income in Vietnam is just over $200.  There are also
training courses on business, and "micro-enterprise" grants to returnees who
wish to start small businesses. </tt><p>
<tt>Some Vietnamese who have settled in America have argued with their children
about returning to their native land to help rebuild the country.  Many older
Vietnamese say they could never trust the government.  While their children,
some who have spent most of their lives in the US, see returning as an
opportunity to help.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Vietnamese who came to the US before 1975 were professionals
and elite members of the US-backed government who were escaping the communist.
Those who came between 1970 and the early 1980s were boat people, entrepreneurs
and others of modest means.  As Vietnam and the US come closer to normalizing
relations, these difference create a schism in which older Vietnamese refugees
feel that the younger ones are selling out to the "enemy " by normalizing
relations with Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>In September, Austria agreed to take up to 60 Vietnamese refugees now
living in Hong Kong detention camps.  This is the first time since 1990 any
country has agreed to take a group of detained Vietnamese.  </tt><p>
<tt>Spain has also agreed to take 19 refugees.  There are about 1,600
Vietnamese "refugees," and 18,000 other Vietnamese, in Hong Kong.  Only 300 are
expected to meet entrance requirements for resettlement nations.  The rest have
medical or drug problems.</tt><p>

<tt>A United Arab Emirates court condemned a 16-year Filipina maid to death for
stabbing her employer to death.  The maid was originally sentenced to seven
years in jail, but was retried at the request of the Philippines because, she
asserted, her employer had raped her.  The Philippines sent three ministers to
the UAE to plead for her life.</tt><p>
<tt>A Kuwaiti woman was sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing her maid,
allegedly because the maid refused to clean the house.  The Filipino government
has renewed its calls for an end to the posting of more maids to the Middle
East.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore government in September rejected a request by the Philippine
government to participate in the approval process of granting work permits for
Filipino maids who work in Singapore.  The Singapore government said that
because migrant workers come from many countries, it would be impractical to
have a separate system for workers from the Philippines.  The government said
it will issue a work permit as long as the foreign worker has a valid travel
document, and both employer and foreign worker meet the processing criteria.
</tt><p>
<tt>The number of overseas workers exported during the first six months of 1995
declined by three percent.  The Philippine Labor Department attributed the
decline to shrinking foreign markets, reduced pay for foreign workers, and the
Philippine policy of discouraging some overseas employment.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the Philippine government, there are 4.2 million Filipino
workers in 43 countries, and they remitted $6 billion in 1994.  </tt><p>

<tt>Libya has expelled 1,500 Palestinian workers, reportedly in retaliation for
the Palestine Liberation Organization making peace with Israel.  There are an
estimated 30,000 Palestinians in Libya.  </tt><p>
<tt>On September 29, the Libyan government announced that all the Palestinian
workers had decided to voluntarily leave the country en masse.  Press reports
indicate it was not a voluntary departure.  In addition, Egyptian and Sudanese
workers have been ordered out of the country.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Libya, the expulsions are part of an effort to reduce the
number of illegal aliens, and to open up jobs for Libyans.  There are reports
that recent rioting between the police and Islamic groups in Benghazi, along
with difficulties paying foreign workers in Libya. </tt><p>
<tt>There are reports that a Libyan team has been sent to Baghdad to recruit
more Iraqis to join the 65,000 who already work in Libya.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, the Palestinians expelled have not found a country willing
to accept them.  Some are  stranded on the Libyan border with Egypt, others
have gone to the Gaza Strip or Jordan.  Israel refuses to allow many to enter
because they cannot prove they are permanent residents of the Gaza Strip.  The
United Nations plans to build an emergency camp along the Egyptian-Libyan
border. </tt><p>
<tt>There are also 15,000 Sudanese stranded in a Libyan border town awaiting
transport home.  The remainder of the 200,000 Sudanese have until December 1995
to leave the country. </tt><p>
<tt>In most Middle Eastern countries, migrant workers have few labor rights.
In most countries, workers can lose their work and residence visas for
attempting to organize into unions--in Kuwait, a worker must be legally
employed for at least five years before joining a union.  Foreign workers
cannot hold union offices, and thus cannot directly bargain with
employers.</tt><p>
