CITY ATTORNEY BLASTS TOLEDO EDISON'S NUMEROUS SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL DISCOUNTS

   Toledo Edison's practice of negotiating special discount contracts with
large industrials is coming under heavy fire from the city of Toledo as the
utility's $35.2-million electric rate case moves slowly through the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission.
   Cleveland Electric Illuminating, a Centerior Energy subsidiary as is
Toledo Edison, is seeking a $83-million rate hike. Together, the two
companies whose electric rates already are among the highest in the Midwest
are asking for $118-million (Case No. 95-300-EL-AIR) (IEB, 21 April '95,
5).
   In written comments filed recently with the PUC, the city of Toledo took
a dim view of Toledo Ed's request, especially in light of what the city
claims is an over-reliance on special contracts by the utility.
   Toledo city attorney Kerry Bruce objected to a recent PUC staff report
that recommended the commission approve the full $118-million increase for
the Centerior companies. The report, Bruce said, ``fails to consider
whether the number of incentive contracts and the magnitude of the
discounts provided violate the prohibition (under Ohio law) against the
setting of special rates.''
   According to Bruce, the report also ``fails to determine whether the
extensive use of incentive contracts to industrial customers exceeds the
purpose of retaining load and instead establishes a rate which is unjustly
discriminatory and unjustly preferential'' in violation of state law.
   Bruce asserted that more than 71% of the potential customers and 92% of
the potential kWh sales under Toledo Edison's Large Power Rate PV-44 are on
special contracts. Under such a scenario, ``it is not clear what purpose
the tariff rate serves,'' he said.
   A Toledo Edison spokeswoman acknowledged that ``yes, we do have a large
number of our large load customers on special contracts.'' She said special
contracts often are the best way to address the individual needs of
customers, not just with price but with other utility services as well.
   Of the 87 large industrials that qualify for Toledo Edison's PV-44 rate,
62 either have special contracts or are receiving the utility's economic
development rates, she confirmed. Under the PV-44 rate, a primary
transmission customer pays a monthly demand charge of $18.25/kVA for the
first 1,000 kVA, $18.05/kVA for the next 29,000 kVA and $17.16/kVA for each
additional kVA. For sub-transmission, the comparable charges per kVA are
$17.48, $17.20 and $16.18.
   Despite the relatively high rate, the number of special contracts, Bruce
told Industrial Energy Bulletin, is simply unacceptable. ``It violates
ratemaking policy to have more load under special contracts than under a
tariff,'' he said. ``It shows the company is subject to market pressures
and really can't implement its regulatory rate.''
   The Toledo Edison spokeswoman defended the special contracts.
``Obviously, it is a competitive marketplace,'' she said. Her company
``recognizes the need to keep large customers in our service area. It's
important to keep those jobs and economic development here instead of
letting it leave.''
   Bruce summed up the city's position by insisting that the utility should
not increase its rates ``because it's bad for business.'' Instead of asking
customers to pay an additional $118-million annually, both Toledo Edison
and CEI should eliminate heir dividend, he said.

ELCON DETAILS PLAN FOR RESTRUCTURING, ISSUES `ROAD MAP' TO COMPETITIVE ERA

   Industrials' major national representative on electric power issues, the
Electricity Consumers Resource Council, last week issued its detailed
``Road Map for the Transition,'' which fills in gaps that critics found in
its ``Blueprint for Customer Choice'' (IEB, 6 Oct '95, 1).
   The biggest feature of the transition document is a plan for dealing
with utilities' stranded investment. Under ELCON's proposal, utilities
would be able to recover up to 50% of their costs stranded by competition,
but in practice, few if any would be able to get back that much.
   The Edison Electric Institute quickly denounced the road map as ``full
of dead ends and some pretty deep potholes.'' EEI criticized the proposal
as a one-size-fits-all imposition of a federal structure on the country's
electric system that will benefit ELCON's members ``at the expense of
everyone else.''
   Still, the road map puts ELCON once again in the vanguard of the
restructuring movement; its proposal is the first one offered in such
detail for consideration by Congress and states as they approach major
decisions this year and next. It is surely not the last, however.
   Rep. Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.), chairman of the House energy and power
subcommittee, told Industrial Energy Bulletin Monday that the full
Commerce Committee will vote out restructuring legislation this year.
Anyone who thinks it will not do so is mistaken, he declared. He urged
input from all sectors of the industry.
   Schaefer reacted only briefly to ELCON's plan. ``I thought they brought
in some good points,'' he said, although he took issue with ELCON's
proposed three-year transition to retail competition, which he called too
fast. ``Real comprehensive legislation--you have to give it time,'' he
said. ``I'm not sure three years is the answer.'' He suggested a phased-in
approach so as not to ``upset things.''
   When ELCON released its blueprint in September, it purposely glossed
over the stranded-cost issue. Shortly thereafter, Schaefer and William
Massey of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission challenged the group to
come forward with specific proposals addressing stranded-cost recovery.
   ELCON's answer to those challenges is a five-step process featuring a
formula for dividing up responsibility for unmitigable stranded investment.
The formula assigns a ``responsibility factor'' to utilities, to be
determined by state regulators according to how efficiently a utility
responded to regulatory mandates and whether the company opposed the
mandates in the first place.
   A utility would be required to absorb at least 50% of its unmitigable
stranded costs, but in practice it probably would have to bear a greater
share. In a nutshell, the formula starts by assigning stranded costs
equally between ratepayers and shareholders, with the responsibility factor
deciding how much of the ratepayers' 50% share the utility would be
required to absorb in addition to its 50% share.
   But the formula only would be applied after state regulators conduct
what ELCON is billing as ``the last great rate case'' to determine what
sunk costs are not mitigable. In the alternative, the utility could opt to
sell its generation assets as a means of determining stranded costs.
   Stranded-cost recovery mechanisms would be subject to negotiation with
individual customers and classes of customers. Regulators would decide
recovery in the absence of a negotiated settlement. The utility would have
no more than five years to recover its stranded costs.
   ELCON executive director John Anderson called the road map's stranded
cost provisions a ``statesmanlike'' effort to end the impasse between ELCON
and EEI over stranded-cost recovery. Historically, ELCON has rejected any
level of stranded-cost recovery in response to EEI's position that
utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. With its proposal on the table,
the issue of stranded-cost recovery is now open to negotiation, Anderson
suggested.
   But EEI president Thomas Kuhn called ELCON's proposal on stranded costs
a nonstarter.
   ``I don't see that there's anything new in the ELCON proposal,'' Kuhn
said in an appearance before the Washington International Energy Group.
``We don't see a bargaining chip here at all.''
   Kuhn cited ``leading economists,'' FERC and most states as endorsing
EEI's position that utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. He predicted
that states will reject ELCON's complicated proposal.
   ELCON's road map proposes a three-year transition featuring a ``customer
election period'' based on the telephone industry experience. No later than
the mid-point of the three-year transition period, state regulators would
feature a ``Day One'' designating the beginning of the customer election
period. As of that date, every customer would have the right to choose an
electric service provider. Customers would be notified at least six months
prior to Day One of their right to switch from their utility provider.
   At the end of the transition, all generation assets will have been
removed from rate base. The generation company may continue to sell the
asset's power to its affiliated--or previously affiliated--distribution
company beyond the transition period under terms of a transition contract
approved by the state.
   Transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services to qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act. The utility PURPA Reform group criticized this aspect of the
proposal as setting the stage for ``the last great PURPA land rush.'' The
group called it inconsistent to deny utilities stranded costs while
committing them indefinitely to the purchase of QF power.
   But ELCON's Anderson rejected utility complaints about uneconomic QF
contracts as ``a thing of the past.'' No utility is entering into high-cost
contracts with PURPA facilities today, he said. The importance of PURPA's
Section 210 is not its mandatory purchase provision, but the section's
requirements that utilities provide backup and ancillary services to QFs.
   As a check against market power, ELCON's road map calls for operational
unbundling of vertically integrated utilities using the Dept. of Justice's
methodology. While free market entry is an important check, it is not
sufficient in and of itself, the group said. Transmission assets would be
turned over to an independent system operator and controls would be placed
on interaffiliate pricing of transmission services and interaffiliate
distribution transactions.
   EEI's Kuhn dismissed as ``specious'' ELCON's concerns about utility
market power and industry concentration. The electric utility industry is a
great deal less concentrated than the telephone industry or most ELCON
members, Kuhn asserted.
   ELCON further proposed that, during the first two years of the
transition, owners of FERC-regulated transmission facilities would be
required to file regional transmission group proposals. Siting of new
interstate transmission systems would become FERC's responsibility. ELCON
also proposed establishment of unregulated Private Delivery Systems, or
PDSs, such as a line linking two industrial facilities.
   If a new transmission line is built privately and without the exercise
of eminent domain, then the line would be unregulated. Owners of existing
transmission systems could petition FERC for a license to opt out from rate
regulation if the owner can show it does not exercise market power and the
line was not sited through the power of eminent domain. The unregulated
privately owned transmission facilities would provide competitive pressures
on monopoly transmission providers, ELCON suggested.
   Independent System Operator franchises would be granted for finite
periods in order to allow others the opportunity to competitively bid for
the right to serve the franchise, ELCON proposed.
   Local distribution services would be unbundled with traditional
distribution functions split between the ``wires'' business and the
electric services merchant business under the proposal.
   ELCON also proposes establishment of joint federal-state boards to make
recommendations for state legislative actions to ensure universal service.
   The road map places much of the responsibility for the outcome of the
transition with state regulators, said ELCON's Anderson. The proposal is
intended to put to rest concerns of state regulators that ELCON advocates
``federalizing the system,'' he said: ``The states are going to have a
whole lot to do'' if the road map is implemented.

NEES REACHES DEAL WITH N.H. PUC STAFF FOR WHEELING PILOT THAT WILL BEGIN IN
MAY

   New England Electric System has reached an agreement with the New
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission staff on conditions for its local
affiliate, Granite State Electric, to carry out a retail wheeling pilot
program starting in May 1996.
   NEES announced the breakthrough Jan. 5 during a briefing to the
commission on collaborative talks between the staff and all utilities in
the state on the two-year pilot, which had been proposed in October to
cover 3% of utility load.
   No other utility announced on Jan. 5 that it had come to terms with the
staff and, therefore, the commission permitted an extra week until Jan. 12
for negotiations.
   In the NEES agreement with the staff, only general outlines were made
public. But sources familiar with the deal said the two sides split the
difference on the key stranded cost issue and that Granite State would be
allowed to recoup 75% of its losses caused by the pilot.
   Granite State will use an access charge to recover the stranded cost and
said the level would be low enough to give customers a ``meaningful'' level
of savings from the pilot. Currently, Granite State's average prices are
10.3 cents/kWh for residential and 7.9 cents/kWh for industrial users.
   In its September draft guidelines, the PUC had proposed 50% recovery of
losses, and NEES and the other utilities had replied by demanding full 100%
recovery before they would cooperate on the plan.
   Once the NEES deal with the staff is formally proposed to the PUC, it is
sure to draw fire from both industrial groups that support the original 50%
level and probably Public Service of New Hampshire, which has held out for
100% recovery.
   In a statement, NEES said the agreement was meant to allow the retail
wheeling pilot proceed as scheduled in May for Granite State customers even
if it is delayed for other utilities in the state. NEES also said that once
the plan was approved by the PUC, it would communicate with its customers
about how they could participate in the pilot.
   Participants would receive unbundled rates for transmission and
distribution and could chose their power supplier. They also would continue
to receive energy conservation programs from the distributor.
   In its October proposal, the PUC allotted 3.75 MW of Granite State's
load to the statewide pilot, which would cover a total of 60 MW. PSNH is by
far the largest participant with 44 MW, although this level may be reduced
to 33 MW.
   While reaching a final deal with PSNH is clearly the top priority of the
PUC, the agreement with NEES appears to be a breakthrough that could make
it harder for PSNH to maintain a hard line in future talks.

MOJAVE PIPELINE PLANS NEW OPEN SEASON IN JAN. OR FEB. TO DECIDE FATE OF
PROJECT

   Mojave Pipeline will hold a new ``open season'' auction in January or
February, and the outcome could decide the fate of the controversial
California natural gas pipeline project.
   Mojave, the Bakersfield, Calif., subsidiary of El Paso Natural Gas, has
been trying since 1992 to break into the California market, providing the
only major transportation alternative to Pacific Gas & Electric for big
users. The line would extend from the Arizona border to Sacramento, with
laterals running to the industrial area around San Francisco Bay. With its
firm rate of 47 cents/decatherm, the line drew a number of large
industrials eager to escape PG&E's intrastate transport rates, which can
exceed $1/dt.
   But the project got bogged down by regulatory demands at both the state
and federal levels (IEB, 8 Sept, 2). Meanwhile, PG&E began discounting its
rates to large users and a number of industrials took those offers, rather
than wait out the regulatory uncertainty.
   In the most recent development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
ordered Mojave to hold an open season for shippers on Mojave's existing
line--which only extends as far as Bakersfield--to release capacity to
prospective northward expansion customers.
   Although this does not directly affect the expansion itself, Mojave
decided to throw open the whole project to auction in order to gauge the
remaining market interest, according to president Michael Holland.
   The existing contracts call for a firm rate of 47 cents/dt, escalating
at 1% annually, for 15 years. That, however, was based on a project of 475
million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d). ``If the market supports a smaller
project, rates may hve to go higher,'' Holland said, and he added that
Mojave will need at least 325 mmcf/d to proceed at all.
   On a positive note, the recent FERC order favored Mojave on a nagging
pricing issue that threatened to repel more customers (Docket No.
CP93-258-007).
   Previously, the commission ruled that Mojave would have to file new rate
cases each year, instead of fixing 15-year contracts. But the company
complained that neither Mojave nor its customers could abide that kind of
uncertainty and the condition was overturned on rehearing.

N.J. MOVES PSE&G LGAC TO MONTH BASIS, TO LET BIG USERS PLAY MARKET BETTER

   The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has approved a proposal by
Public Service Electric & Gas to switch gas price calculations from a
yearly to a monthly basis.
   This will affect the levelized gas adjustment clause (LGAC), which lets
utilities recover their actual fuel costs. Traditionally, utilities have
updated the LGAC on an annual basis, but the market is now so vibrant, that
customers need more frequent price signals, according to the BPU.
   ``The monthly pricing scheme reflects the current market price and will
allow customers to make more informed decisions concerning their energy
needs,'' said BPU president Herbert Tate.
   With the LGAC changing on a monthly basis, large users will be able to
decide whether to buy from the utility, or from outside suppliers.
   Very large industrials mostly buy exclusively from suppliers or
marketers, using the local utility only for transportation. However,
smaller industrials may still take gas supplies from their local
utilities.
   PSE&G, which proposed the alteration, is indifferent to the price
changes, since utilities only pass along fuel costs on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, and earn no profit.

IN WHAT MAY BE PG&E'S LAST GENERAL RATE CASE, INDUSTRIALS WIN 8% ELECTRIC
CUTS

   Pacific Gas & Electric's large industrial customers will enjoy an 8%
reduction in electric rates this year while the utility also will reduce
its gas rates and pipeline tariffs for core and noncore customers and
cogenerators.
   The California Public Utilities Commission December 20 ordered PG&E to
reduce its 1996 electric rates by $434-million, or an average 5.5%, and gas
rates by $262-million, or an average 11.77%, effective January 1. The
combined rate cuts incorporated PG&E's general rate case with several other
electric and gas revenue and pipeline expansion proceedings.
   The rate cuts will be shared by all customer classes, with all classes
gaining at least 50% of the average reduction and large customers limited
to 150% of the average reduction. The PUC reduced PG&E's electric rates for
commercial and small industrial customers 7%, agricultural rates 2.6%, and
residential rates 2.9%.
   ``This is great news for PG&E customers,'' said PUC Commissioner Jessie
Knight, Jr. ``As industrial customers see lower electric costs the economy
benefits,'' as higher earnings stimulate job growth, he said
   This is expected to be PG&E's last three-year general rate case since
the PUC plans to adopt performance-based ratemaking in implementing its
electric restructuring order providing incentives for utilities to operate
more efficiently and rewarding productivity.
   The PUC has adopted a PBR mechanism for San Diego Gas & Electric and is
currently considering a PBR proposal by Southern California Edison.
Moreover, the PUC has already severed fuel costs, Diablo Canyon ratemaking,
and rate of return issues from PG&E's general rate case and reviews them in
separate proceedings.
   The PUC noted that the decision represented its first step toward
removing large commercial customers from averaging of core residential and
nonresidential gas rates and tariffs. The PUC accordingly approved a slight
shift in PG&E's gas revenue requirement from noncore to core customers.
   The commission adopted PG&E's proposal to reinstate a seasonal rate
differential for noncore industrial and cogeneration gas customers. At the
same time, the PUC rejected the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's
proposal for an unbundled backbone transmission rate, noting that PG&E
plans to unbundle tranmission and storage services.
   The PUC adopted the recommendations of Administrative Law Judge Kim
Malcolm, trimming PG&E's 1996 rates more than the utility had requested.
PG&E had proposed reducing its 1996 electric rates by $128.7-million and
its gas rates by $203.6-million.
   The utility had initially sought to reduce its electric rates by
$200.8-million and its gas rates by $119.1-million, but modified its
requests several times. PG&E has proposed rate cuts to reduce its electric
rates to 10 cents/kWh by December 1999 from its current rates of 10.5
cents/kWh.
   ``It is unusual for a utility to request substantial rate reductions in
its general rate case but a welcome one,'' PUC President Daniel Fessler
said. ``This represents significant progress (in reducting electric rates),
but it is a beginning.''
   PG&E maintained that its final revenue request was a ``bare bones''
proposal in line with its ongoing corporate-wide programs to reduce
operating costs and rates. However, ALJ Malcolm found that PG&E's estimates
of doing business in 1996 and $4.6-billion revenue requirement request were
too high. She stressed that it would be unfair for ratepayers to help
finance the utility's transition to a competitive electric industry.
   Malcolm determined that PG&E had overestimated its future costs for
nuclear decommissioning, employee compensation and pension fund, and
pipeline replacement. She also found that PG&E's timing of recovery for
fossil and geothermal decommissioning costs was unreasonable.
   The ALJ also denied PG&E's request for nearly $30-million in ratepayer
subsidies for marketing programs designed to retain customers, saying that
those costs should be paid by shareholders or customers that benefit
directly from such programs.

SOUTH CAROLINA INDUSTRIALS TO CHALLENGE BROAD RATE HIKES APPROVED FOR
SCE&G

   An industrial group in South Carolina will challenge the Public Service
Commission's late-December decision to approve virtually all of the general
rate increase requested by South Carolina Electric & Gas (Docket No.
95-1000-E).
   Arthur Fusco, a Columbia, S.C., attorney who represents the South
Carolina Energy Users Committee, said the group will urge the PSC to
reconsider several key aspects of its ruling, which granted SCE&G a 7.34%,
$67.5-million general rate increase to be implemented in two phases--a
$59.5-million hike as soon as its new, 385-MW baseload plant in Cope, S.C.,
begins commercial operation later this month, and an $8-million increase
next Jan. 1.
   The investor-owned utility had requested a two-step increase totaling
$76.7-million, or 8.35%, primarily to recoup the $436-million cost of the
Cope plant.
   The commission also said it will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of
return on common equity, which is lower than the 12.25% rate the utility
had requested, but higher than both the 11% it had been permitted to earn
and the 11.25% to 11.75% range proposed by most of those who testified to
the PSC.
   Fusco took issue with the 12% rate of return, noting that even a
quarter-percent increase in that rate results in ``significantly higher''
rates for industrials and others. He also criticized the PSC's decision to
support SCE&G's proposals to establish a $50-million, customer-funded storm
damage reserve fund, and to transfer nearly $256.7-million in depreciation
reserves from the utility's transmission and distribution assets to its
nuclear generation assets.
   The depreciation-reserve shift, Fusco said, will artificially reduce
SCE&G's nuclear generation costs, but increase the utility's T&D costs and,
presumably, its transmission-access and wheeling costs. That, he continued,
would give SCE&G an unfair competitive advantage over other generators, and
will force anyone who seeks access to the utility's T&D system to pay
more.
   Belton Ziegler, SCE&G's general counsel, said the transfer is a
necessary preemptive step to ensure that any industrials that leave the
utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had developed to
serve them.
   Without the shift, he said, residential and small-commercial customers
would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the utility's stranded
investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   Ziegler continued, ``If you look at the natural gas industry, the
benefits of deregulation went--for the most part--to large customers who
could move off the system'' and avoid, as much as possible, the
responsibility for paying off the investments their old gas companies had
made to serve them.
   ``We are telling industrials that if they leave as generation customers
they still will have to pay [for the nuclear assets SCE&G developed for
them] as transmission and distribution customers.''
   Ziegler also dismissed assertions that the storm fund is unfair. He said
that after Hurricane Hugo battered SCE&G's service territory in September
1989, the utility looked into ways it could prepare for the next big
storm.
   ``It became clear that commercial insurance would be prohibitively
expensive, and that would make more sense to set up a fund'' like the one
the utility proposed and the PSC just approved.
   Fusco said the industrial group is likely to support the South Carolina
Dept. of Consumer Affairs' newly announced plan to ask the PSC to
reconsider its ruling.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, DCA's deputy consumer advocate, told Industrial
Energy Bulletin said the DCA took issue with virtually all aspects of the
PSC's ruling, asserting that the rate increase is more than three times
larger than it should be, and that South Carolina law does not allow the
creation of a storm fund like the one the commission approved.
   But Coombs said her agency is most concerned about the
depreciation-reserve transfer, which she said would have the effect of
shifting SCE&G's costs away from its generation sector, which is likely to
face increasing competition as electric-industry deregulation takes hold,
to its transmission and distribution sector, which is likely to remain a
monopoly.
   As a result, she said, SCE&G will have ``a significantly increased
probability'' of recouping--through T&D rates--nuclear investment costs
that ``otherwise would have been subjected to an uncertain policy regarding
the recovery of costs of uneconomic generation capacity.''
   Coombs said that if the commission fails to reverse this and other key
elements of its ruling, her agency is likely to file a legal challenge in
state court.

CONSUMERS INKS LONG-TERM DISCOUNT DEALS WITH THREE MICH. INDUSTRIALS

   Three large industrial firms in Consumers Power's territory have struck
long-term power agreements with the utility in exchange for specified
discounts.
   On Dec. 7, the Michigan Public Service Commission granted ex parte
approval to Consumers' request to become the sole supplier of electricity
to Dow Corning and its affiliate Hemlock Semiconductor (Case U-10997).
   The PSC also granted ex parte approval to Consumers to provide power to
Bundy Tubing on a sole-supplier basis (Case U-10995). A contract between
the utility and Pharmacia & Upjohn is pending.
   Under the agreement between Consumers and Dow Corning, Consumers will be
sole supplier over an eight-year period. Although specific dollar figures
were not disclosed, Dow said it would save several million in energy costs
over the life of the agreement.
   The deal covers three key industrial facilities and is crafted to retain
an existing load and to meet new power requirements between now and 2003.
According to a Consumers spokesman, the utility currently supplies a total
of 50 MW to Dow's corporate center, Hemlock Semiconductor and Dow's Midland
site, which contains an operating 18-MW, wood-fired cogeneration plant.
   Over the eight years of the agreement, this 50 MW gradually be increased
to 110 MW, as the cogeneration unit is shut down next year and Hemlock
Semiconductor expands its facility, the spokesman said.
   A separate agreement calls for the Midland Cogeneration Venture, a
Consumers Power affiliate, to supply approximately one billion lbs. of
steam annually to Dow Corning.
   The special contract with Bundy Tubing has an initial term of five
years, after which time it is subject to automatic renewal for successive
one-year periods. However, after the initial term either party may cancel
the contract by providing the other with timely written notice.
   The contract requires Bundy Tubing to purchase all of its electricity
from Consumers except for back-up generation. Rates and terms of the
purchase are governed by Consumers' Rate D less 15%. Rate D has a charge of
$100/customer/month and an on-peak billing demand charge of $7.85/kW. In
addition, there is a maximum demand charge of $1.85/kW for primary service,
$0.97/kW for subtransmission service and $0.52/kW for transmission
service.
   The special contract with Bundy contains provisions to encourage the
industrial to implement demand and energy savings programs. Consumers has
agreed to reimburse Bundy for the cost of such programs up to $20,000,
provided the programs are completed to Consumers' satisfaction before Jan.
1, 1996, are designed to improve the industrial firm's operations in
Coldwater, Mich., and are performed in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations.
   On Dec. 4, Consumers signed a contract with Pharmacia & Upjohn, its
second largest industrial customer, to become the sole supplier of 75 MW at
discounted rates for 10 years. The contract applies to the industrial
firm's research facility in Kalamazoo, Mich., and its manufacturing plant
in Portage, Mich.

PUC CLOSES PECO INTERRUPTIBLE RIDER; INDUSTRIALS SAY GROWTH WILL SUFFER

   The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that PECO Energy may
close its interruptible rate program to new load (Docket No. R-943281). The
move was opposed by the Philadelphia Area Industrial Energy Users Group
(PAIEUG) and Scott Paper Co., who said interruptible rates help attract new
load, and that freezing the program will hurt economic development (Docket
Nos. R-943281C002 and R-943281C0003).
   The Large Interruptible Rate Option (LILR) provides a discount rate of
approximately 57%, reducing charges from PECO from 7.493 cents/kWh to 3.217
cents/kWh. Although the PUC approved an alternative rate (IR-1), this will
provide a discount of only 5%, to new interruptible customers.
   When PECO proposed freezing LILR, it asked to limit interruptible rates
to customers who were under contract by Oct 1, 1995 (IEB, 25 Aug '95, 7).
It argued that interruptible rates were meant as a load management tool.
However, the utility now has up to 1,000 MW of excess capacity, and the
value of interruptible load has diminished. Since 1984, it has only
interrupted the LILR customers 12 times, PECO pointed out.
   However, industrials responded that the interruptible program is
important for economic development, and was never meant primarily as a load
management tool. Closing out this program will deter firms from starting
new plants in PECO territory or expanding existing plants, they said. In
addition, industrials fear that PECO will use the freeze as the first step
toward phasing-out existing interruptible rates altogether--basing this
prospect on statements by the company. PAIEUG noted that some of its
members have invested millions of dollars to expand in PECO territory, with
the expectation of interruptible service.
   In its decision, the PUC pointed out that PECO has other economic
development tariffs, such as flexible rate options, and that ``PECO is
well-equipped, without the LILR, to attract new load to the territory.'' It
added that electric rates are rarely the sole decisive factor in a
company's location decision and said that LILR has only been a significant
factor in only one firm's decision to move into the area--Lukens Steel.
Taxes, transportation and telecommunications are usually more important
factors, according to the PUC.
   It added that ``Continued availability of [LILR] would...produce a
reduction in PECO's revenues, which would ultimately cause the rates of
other customer classes to increase, which would not help to preserve
existing employment and investment.'' Because the economic development
argument is ``a bald assertion'' by PAIEUG, ``there are no direct benefits
to balance the cost of providing a subsidy of over 3.5 cents/kWh to LILR
customers,'' the PUC said.
   The commission also rejected PAIEUG's assertion that interruptible
customers should not incur generation-related capital costs since the
utility does not have to plan to meet their needs--it can simply interrupt
them any time it needs the capacity. The PUC noted that these customers are
only curtailed at times of peak demand, so that interruptible load only
displaces relatively low capital-cost peaking capacity, and cannot
substitute for baseload or intermediate capacity.

N.C. MUNICIPAL SAYS COINCIDENT-PEAK RATES ATTRACT, RETAIN INDUSTRIALS

   Coincident-peak-based rates that all larger industrial customers of
Greenville, N.C.'s municipal utility must pay are not only enabling
existing industrials to lower their electric bills, they are also helping
the muni lure new industrial firms to the city.
   So says John D. Chaffee, executive director of the Pitt County
Development Commission, adding that industrials that take full advantage of
what the CP rates can offer generally pay no more--and sometimes less--than
they would for electricity from investor-owned utilities and electric
cooperatives that serve areas around Greenville.
   The Greenville Utilities Commission (GUC), as the muni is known,
purchases all its wholesale power from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal
Power Agency, which in turn buys most of its power from Carolina Power &
Light. Because a significant portion of NCEMPA's and the muni's wholesale
power costs is based on their demand during CP&L's highest systemwide
demand hour each month, the muni agency and Greenville have been working
hard to minimize their monthly peaks through, among other things,
aggressive residential load control programs, and programs to help
industrials install peak-shaving generation (IEB, 29 Dec `95, 4).
   GUC general manager Roger Jones said the Greenville muni also in
mid-1994 replaced its traditional industrial rate schedule with a new menu
of CP-only rates that all customers with a demand of 750 kW or more must
choose from.
   They include an ``A'' rate for 750 kW-plus customers whose energy use
must be relatively constant, a ``B'' rate for 750 kW-plus industrials with
more flexibility, and a ``C'' rate for 8 MW-plus customers that are
willing--and able--to make significant reductions in their energy use
during coincident-peak periods.
   Under each rate, the customer pays a basic monthly charge of $440, plus
a relatively high per-kW rate for its demand during the 60 minutes each
month when CP&L--the muni's ultimate power supplier--experiences its
highest systemwide demand. The customer also pays a much smaller per-kW
charge for difference between that coincident-peak level and its highest
demand for all that month, plus energy charges.
   For instance, under the ``C'' rate, a 8-MW customer that reduces its
coincident-peak demand to 2 MW pays the $440 basic charge, plus demand
charges of $21.34/kW on the 2-MW coincident-peak demand and $2.86/kW on the
6 MW above that level. The customer also pays an energy charge of 3.323
cents/kWh.
   ``B'' rate customers, in turn, pay demand charges of $20.16 per
coincident-peak-hour kW and $4.25/kW of demand above that level, and energy
charges of 3.583 cent/kWh for the first 250 MWH and 3.278 cents/kWh for
additional energy.
   ``A'' rate customers, finally, pay a CP-hour demand charge of $18.36/kW,
$7.77/kW for excess demand, and the same energy charges as ``B'' rate
customers.
   [The GUC typically notifies its industrial customers by automated signal
when it expects a potential coincident-peak period to be approaching; at
that point, the rate agreement says, the customer ``may utilize any means
deemed suitable to reduce its coincident peak demand,'' including, for
instance, temporary production cuts and/or the use of muni-approved
peak-shaving generators.]
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW-plus customers, who also include some
large commercial and institutional accounts, together comprise about
one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use, and that the CP rates have
encouraged them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20% from what
it typically would have been without the coincident-peak rates.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varies widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%. For example, a large Proctor &
Gamble manufacturing plant in Greenville that typically demands about 8 MW
reduces its demand to between 1 and 1.5 MW during coincident peaks, Jones
noted, saving both P&G and the muni thousands of dollars in monthly power
costs.
   Chaffee said P&G ``basically shuts down production [during forecasted CP
hours] to achieve the maximum possible savings.'' To make the best use of
its down time, he noted, the manufacturer performs required maintenance on
its production and other equipment.
   The development commission head said his panel and GUC work closely with
potential industrial recruits to explain the CP rates and to demonstrate
precisely how the industrial could make the fullest use of the rate to its
advantage.
   Chaffee gave as an example the new automobile parts plant that Japan's
ASMO Co. Ltd. in 1994 developed--and in 1995 expanded--in Greenville. The
combined $50-million facility demands about 2.5 MW.
   ``An important issue for ASMO in deciding where to site the [initial]
plant was power costs,'' he said. ``We were able to demonstrate that by
utilizing Greenville's CP rate and installing [a 1-MW peak-shaving
generator to further reduce CP demand] that they would be paying rates
competitive with'' industrial rates offered by Duke Power and other
low-cost, investor-owned utilities in the Southeast.
   Chaffee added, finally, that in his view the CP has been a significant
factor in enabling Greenville to draw increasing numbers of new industries.
He noted that while industrial firms announced $20-million in new
investments in the city in 1992 and $33-million the year after that,
industrial investment jumped to $43-million in 1994 and $55-million in
1995--the first two years the CP rates were mandated.

MONSANTO PHOSPHORUS UNIT INKS LONG-TERM DEAL WITH UTAH P&L

   Monsanto Co. and Utah Power & Light have signed a new power supply
agreement extending to 2001 service that was scheduled to expire in
mid-1997 for Monsanto's elemental phosphorus manufacturing plant at Soda
Springs.
   Approved by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the new agreement
includes payment of $30-million to the utility for early termination of the
existing contract, a $66,600 monthly minimum charge and 1.85 cents/kWh for
all energy delivered. (Order No. 26282).
   The new contract allows for delivery of about 1.66 billion kWh annually.
UP&L will supply Monsanto with 9 MW of firm power and up to 206 MW of
interruptible power. UP&L may interrupt or curtail service to Monsanto, its
largest Idaho customer, at any time to maintain its system integrity.
   ``The company's new agreement with Monsanto,'' the commission said,
``reflects changes required by manufacturing and supply options available
to Monsanto, and market and regulatory changes within an increasingly more
competitive electric industry.''
   Monsanto has alternatives to continuing its current levels of electric
use such as acquiring power through the Soda Springs municipal electric
system or changing to a much less energy-intensive, purified wet-acid
chemical process of producing phosphorus.
   The commission said, ``Our acceptance and approval of the proposed new
agreement should in no way be interpreted as preauthorization of retail
wheeling, accounting, ratemaking treatment or any rates other than those
specifically identified in the new agreement.''

NIPSCO INDUSTRIALS TO SEE $1.5-MILLION REFUND IN DISPUTED INSURANCE CLAIM

   Industrial customers of Northern Indiana Public Service are expected to
receive at least a $1.5-million refund from a disputed insurance settlement
stemming from the July 2, 1991, collapse of a water pipe at NIPSCO's 480-MW
Bailly coal plant on Lake Michigan.
   Bailly was knocked out of commercial operation for nearly five months
following the collapse of its main circulating water pipes leading into
Lake Michigan. The 15-foot-diameter pipes gave way while Pure Air Inc.
worked nearby to construct a $110-million scrubber at Bailly.
   During the outage, NIPSCO was forced to purchase surplus power from
other utilities at prices higher than what Bailly's industrial customers
had been paying. NIPSCO eventually recovered $9.65-million from its
insurance carrier, but flowed back only $2.75-million to compensate
ratepayers for fuel increases in excess of $6-million as a result of the
accident.
   According to industrial attorney Jack Wickes, of the Indianapolis law
firm Lewis & Kappes, ratepayers paid an additional $6.1-million in fuel
costs during Bailly's outage. Wickes told the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission in a hearing late last year that ratepayers should be ``made
whole'' for their higher costs, meaning they should get an additional
$3-million (Cause No. 387-06-FAC 18-S1) (IEB, 16 Dec '94, 10).
   In a 3-2 vote Dec. 19, the commission ordered NIPSCO to refund an
additional $3.35-million. The IURC based its refund amount on the actual
expenses and required the insurance proceeds to be applied first to the
increased fuel charges, which are covered by the insurance policy.
   Wickes told Industrial Energy Bulletin the order ``makes sense...
[NIPSCO] carried insurance for an eventuality that occurred and NIPSCO
wanted some of the money.'' Of the $3.35-million refund, industrials are
expected to receive at least $1.5- million because they represent ``45% to
50% of the consumption'' at the Bailly plant. The money will be refunded as
a credit on industrials' fuel-adjustment charge.
   Two commissioners--David Ziegner and Richard Klein--dissented from the
order. They agreed with the majority that a further refund was due, but
said only about $2-million should be refunded.

PA. FIRMS STRESS CHOICE OF SUPPLIERS; SEE UTILITIES CONTROLLING POWER POOL

   Pennsylvania industrials told the Public Utilities Commission that
retail competition would provide the choice of suppliers that they enjoy in
all other purchasing decisions and while a wholesale pool would provide
some rate benefits, it would be dominated by the utilities, who would keep
prices artificially high.
   The Industrial Energy Consumers of Pennsylvania (IECPA) stressed the
choice issue during testimony in the PUC's Investigation into Electric
Power Competition (Docket No. I-00940032). In that case, industrials are
calling for a six-year transition to retail competition, beginning in 1997
with customers over 5 MW (IEB, 17 Nov '95, 1).
   During recent hearings, IECPA attorney David Kleppinger, of the
Harrisburg law firm McNees, Wallace & Nurick, told the commission that
retail competition is ``a matter of sound public policy. Customer choice
will empower Pennsylvania customers with the ultimate regulator of price,
namely the competitive marketplace.'' However, customers must have direct
access to utilities' transmission and distribution systems to exercise that
choice, he added. Further, utilities should be required to provide
ancillary services on an unbundled, embedded cost-of-service basis. These
would include scheduling, dispatch, balancing, load following, voltage
support, reactive power and loss compensation.
   The issue of choice arose again when PUC commissioner John Hanger
questioned IECPA's analysis of the proposed wholesale pool. Assuming
``perfect competition,'' the pool price would be 2.67 cents/kWh, IECPA
found, but industrial witness Randall Falkenberg added that utilities
``could bid the price up to anything they want really, but I think that
they would stop at a point just a little bit below what new generation
would be''--or 3.5 to 4 cents/kWh.
   ``What is so bad about a price per kilowatt hour...of 3.5 cents/kWh or 4
cents/kWh as compared to today's prices?'' asked commissioner Hanger. Even
with another 1.2 cents added on for retail distribution, Hanger continued,
``[A]s to the prices people are paying right now in Pennsylvania, is this a
disaster?''
   Falkenberg, with the Atlanta firm Kennedy & Associates, responded, ``The
problem is how you get there. You get to that price because that is the
price at which the market-dominant utilities--principally PECO or
PP&L--decide that they want to charge. That's the problem. It's not that it
falls out of the competitive market. It's that a few people at PECO can
decide that's what we want the price to be, and they can enforce that.'' He
added that the utilities could set the price ``at a level just enough below
that a new entrant could build a generating unit at'' in order to keep out
competition.
   In a pool, Falkenberg explained, there would be seven main utility
sellers and one buyer--the independent system operator (ISO). But with
retail competition, ``what you've got is hundreds of thousands of buyers,
each one playing off one seller against another.''
   The hearings also covered stranded investment. IECPA argued that these
costs should be shared, with ratepayer contributions limited to costs that
result directly from deregulation, and which cannot be mitigated by
utilities. Industrials would probably be willing to bear some cost of
mitigation strategies such as accelerated depreciation of plants and
buyouts of overpriced contracts from non-utility generators, according to
Falkenberg. Utilities might also mitigate stranded costs by selling assets
and downsizing, he added.
   The PUC expects to wrap up the case by April, when it will make
recommendations to the governor and legislature.

ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BACKS RETAIL ACCESS IN N.Y.; NO GUARANTEE ON STRANDED
COSTS

   Several New York legislators, including the speaker of the assembly,
have proposed an electric restructuring plan that would open up retail
competition by the year 2000, but the plan would not give utilities any
guarantee that they could recover all of their stranded investments--a
position that industrials have long taken.
   Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver announced the proposal last
week, along with Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman and Energy
Committee Chair Paul Tonko. An aide to Silver said that legislation is
being drafted and is expected to be introduced by the middle of January.
Sponsors would then be sought for a senate version of the bill.
   The ``Competition Plus'' plan would immediately freeze electric rates,
and would phase-in competition over the next seven years. The first phase
of the transition would begin in September 1997, when all utilities would
be required to purchase power in a competitive wholesale market. In the
second phase, beginning in September 2000, all customers would be allowed
to choose their power suppliers, and utilities would be required to provide
transmission and distribution service. In September 2002, utilities would
be required to divest their generating resources.
   A key aspect of the plan is that it would provide ``no guarantee that
utilities will recover all previously incurred costs.'' The stranded
investment issue is one of the biggest disputes in the restructuring
debate. Utilities demand full recovery of stranded costs, saying they have
been required to build enough capacity to meet load forecasts, and that
regulators approved the expensive projects, such as nuclear plants, that
could become financial millstones in the competitive market.
   Industrials, however, argue that many high costs result from
mismanagement and that utility shareholders should absorb some of the
burden. They say utilities should only be allowed to collect costs that
result directly from deregulation and which cannot be mitigated (IEB, 3 Nov
`95, 10).
   The legislators' initiative comes as the Public Service Commission moves
toward resolution of the ``Competitive Opportunities'' proceeding (Case No.
94-E-0952). It challenges the recent ruling in that case by Administrative
Law Judge Judith Lee, who recommended only wholesale competition until some
unspecified date when retail competition is proven not to harm small
ratepayers and reliability. Industrials bitterly condemned that decision,
saying it preserves the status quo and lets utilities control the direction
of change (IEB, 29 Dec `95, 4).
   In announcing the proposal, Assemblyman Tonko stated, ``As the electric
industry moves to a competitive environment, it is clear that the
legislature has a role in the process. Lessons learned from around the
country--specifically in California and the New England states--indicate
that a purely administrative solution to this complex challenge will not
achieve the desired goal of reducing energy prices.''

INDUSTRIAL DSM SEEN GETTING CUSTOMIZED, INCLUDING HELP ON PRODUCTION,
POLLUTION

   Utilities must transform their industrial demand-side management
programs to meet the demands of the competitive market, according to a new
report. This means shifting from a ``resource procurement'' focus to a
customer service approach, says IRT Environment Inc., a Basalt, Colo.,
information and consulting firm.
   IRT states that ``Utilities must provide enhanced, rather than reduced,
services to their industrial customers to satisfy them as customers in a
direct-access environment.'' It notes that industrials are utilities
``least captive'' customers, with options for fuel switching, cogeneration,
and shifting loads to other regions. Therefore, utilities must heed their
complaints about rate-subsidized DSM, the report says. Most big
manufacturers have been pursuing conservation for years, so they see
rate-based DSM as a form of socialism to subsidize others--including
competing industrial firms that have not taken the same initiative.
Utilities should also realize that prescriptive rebates are not appropriate
for industrial users, the report adds. Up to now, utilities have generally
provided industrials very basic services, such as audits and rebates for
motors and lighting. But process work has not been widespread, partly
because processes vary greatly from industry to industry and from firm to
firm. This demands customized approaches, which should include not just
energy efficiency, but help with power quality, productivity improvements
and environmental compliance.
   Some industrials interviewed for the report doubted that utilities can
provide effective energy services, since they have no entrepreneurial
skills. They think utilities can best promote efficiency through
information, rate design and financing. However, some utilities are
contracting with or even acquiring existing energy service companies.
Others may use consultants with expertise in particular industries to help
their customers.
   The report, ``Industrial Efficiency Programs: Building Strategic
Partnerships,'' is available for $100 from The Results Center, IRT
Environment Inc., P.O. Box 2239, Basalt, Colo. 81621; (970) 927-3155.

INDIANA QUARRY'S REQUEST FOR SERVICE FROM PSI ENERGY OVER CO-OP IS
APPROVED

   Citing reliability concerns, an Indiana industrial has prevailed in its
request to the state Utility Regulatory Commission to be served by PSI
Energy, the state's largest electric company, instead of a small rural
electric cooperative (Cause No. 40008).
   In a mid-December ruling the URC authorized PSI to serve a 1.1-MW load
at U.S. Aggregates' Delphi Quarry, a limestone and gravel quarry near
Delphi, Ind., over the objections of Carroll County Rural Electric
Membership Corp.
   Kenneth Robinson, vice president of operations for U.S. Aggregates, said
his company bought the quarry in 1993 and has been expanding it. The
current site consists of a ``primary'' plant located in Carroll County's
service territory and a ``secondary'' plant located in PSI's territory.
   U.S. Aggregates based its preference for PSI on a number of factors: The
present service from PSI has been good; PSI's energy-only rates with no
demand charge, allowing U.S. Aggregates to forecast its usage and utility
costs accurately; PSI offers a larger industrial base and more stable rates
in the future; U.S. Aggregate's concern with possible brown-outs during the
summer, its peak season; and its belief that PSI's capacity and resources
ensure a continuity of service, even during peak demand periods.
   Carroll County manager Ron Kennedy told the URC that even though his
co-op only has five industrial customers, those customers comprise 35% of
its total load. One customer, Indiana Packers, has a peak demand of 5 MW.
   Also, Carroll County, apparently to quell concerns over the possibility
of outages, noted that its office is located only one-half mile from the
Delphi Quarry. The commission issued its ruling somewhat grudgingly, saying
it discourages the practice of ``rate shopping'' by electric utility
customers. The URC said it has been ``reluctant to base determinations of
public convenience and necessity matters relative to service boundary
disputes on rate differentials.''
   To do so, ``could encourage `rate shopping' at the expense of prudent
planning and good utility practice.'' In this case, however, the URC agreed
with U.S. Aggregates that PSI ``can better provide adequate and reliable
service.'' The investor-owned utility, a subsidiary of CINergy Corp., has a
``marginal benefit'' with regard to reliability over the co-op.
   A URC spokeswoman stressed that the agency's comments about ``rate
shopping'' do not mean the commission is necessarily opposed to retail
wheeling. ``We have to go by our interpretation of the existing law,'' she
said. ``Until and unless we have a different direction from the
Legislature, we have to follow existing laws.''

WEPCO IN DISPUTE WITH UPPER PENINSULA POWER OVER SERVING MINE EXPANSION

   Wisconsin Electric Power and Upper Peninsula Power are currently in
settlement talks trying to resolve a dispute over a proposed retail
wheeling agreement that would have allowed WEPCO to supply electricity to
the White Pine mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula--one of UPPCo's current
customers.
   White Pine is one of the facilities of Copper Range--a corporation
engaged in the mining, refining, and selling of copper in the UP. It
consists of an underground copper mine and related ore processing
facilities located in Carp Lake Township, Ontonagon County, Michigan.
   Until recently, the mine utilized two 20 MW coal-fired generating units
to supply most of its electric energy requirements while occasionally
purchasing small amounts of energy from UPPCo.
   In its application to the Michigan Public Service Commission for
approval of a special contract with the mine, WEPCO said that because of
increased competition, White Pine began exploring the possibility of
expanding its mining operations or, in the alternative, temporarily
shutting down the mine in order to install a new ``solution'' mining
project while pursuing the construction of a new smelter.
   Solution mining injects a slightly acidic liquid into the rock
formations and brings the copper up in liquid form, to be recovered later
as a precipitate.
   Whether White Pine expands operations or builds a new smelter, it has
concluded that the best way to reduce its operating costs, protect jobs,
and provide the greatest likelihood for expanded operations in the future
is to shut down its generating plant and purchase electricity from WEPCO,
the utility stated in its special contract application.
   If approved, WEPCO would supply curtailable electric service to White
Pine. However, WEPCO does not have transmission facilities to serve
increased loads so in order to service to the mine, the utility, on June 1,
entered into a joint use transmission agreement with UPPCo that would
obviate any necessity for WEPCO to build new facilities to serve the mine
until the new smelter is built.
   In its special contract application, WEPCO stated that it was seeking no
certificated authority to render retail service to any resident or business
in Carp Lake Township other than White Pine. The utility also told the PSC
that the proposed agreement was advantageous to the mine because WEPCO
might buy the mine's generating plant.
   UPPCo said it entered into the joint use transmission agreement with
WEPCO at a time when it was believed that UPPCo's transmission facilities
alone would, in the future, be unable to provide reliable service to While
Pine. UPPCo noted that if the mine had shut down its two generating units,
installed the new ``solution'' mining project, and constructed the new
smelter, demand might have increased to more than 100 MW. UPPCo does not
have transmission facilities in place that are capable of serving loads of
this magnitude and an investment would have been required to construct such
facilities. To make such an investment ``in a volatile industry would have
created a substantial risk for a small utility such as UPPCo,'' the company
told the PSC in its petition to intervene.
   When it learned that WEPCO was willing to assume the risk of building
new transmission facilities, UPPCo said it decided to cooperate with the
larger utility and entered into the joint use agreement.
   However, according to UPPCo, there has been a subsequent change in
circumstances that makes the joint use agreement no longer ``necessary or
appropriate'' for its purposes. Specifically, Copper Range shut down its
White Pine mining operations, including the 40 MW generating plant,
retaining only the experimental solution mining project and maintenance
operations.
   ``As a result, the resulting curtailed White Pine mine load can be
adequately served by UPPCo over its existing transmission facilities, and
the participation of Wisconsin Electric is no longer necessary or
desirable,'' UPPCo told the PSC in its intervention petition. Accordingly,
UPPCo asked the PSC not to approve WEPCO's special contract petition.
   In a similar argument before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
UPPCo declared that the changed circumstances led it to decide not to file
the joint use agreement with FERC and that WEPCO was not authorized to file
the agreement on UPPCo's behalf. Regulatory proceedings at both FERC and
the PSC are on hold, pending the outcome of settlement talks, sources
said.

MAINE PS WINS APPROVAL FOR DISCOUNTS FOR INDUSTRIALS CREATING NEW LOAD

   Maine Public Service has won approval from the Maine Public Utilities
Commission for a new targeted economic development rate that would give
temporary discounts for new and existing industrial customers creating new
load.
   Under a special rate proposal approved Dec. 1 (Doc. No. 95-802), new
customers with average demand of at least 50 kW who take full load from MPS
will get a credit on their monthly bills equal to 20% the first year of the
contract, 15% the second year, 10% the third year and 5% the fourth year.
   Also, existing customers adding at least 20 kW of new load and meet
other criteria will receive 20% credits for the new supplies in the first
and second contract years, 15% in the third year and 10% in the fourth
year.
   The PUC said it would cap the special credits at a cumulative amount of
20 MW of new supplies and that requests for the discounts for individual
customers would be considered in the order they were received.
   At the same time, the PUC approved a separate 10% permanent discount for
agricultural storage facilities, which will especially help the local
potato industry. In both cases, the PUC also ordered that any revenue
losses due to the discounts will be borne totally by MPS shareholders and
not ratepayers.
   Early in 1995, MPS asked the PUC for an 18.5% rate hike spread over five
years to meet revenue losses caused by the closing of a local air base and
loss of a major wholesale customer. In November, the PUC approved a
four-year, 12.8% hike but left open for a decision next year how the costs
will be allocated among customer classes. MPS has asked that the main
burden be placed on residential users, to bring industrial rates more in
line with cost-of-service levels.
   The new discounts will enable the company to partially offset the cost
of the rate hike for new and expanding businesses and aid industrial
recruiting while the allocation issue is being debated. They also may help
bring new industrial users to the former Loring Air Force Base and restore
some of the revenues lost due to the closure.
   In early January, MPS said it had signed its first economic development
contract under the new system with the Happy Farms cold storage facility in
Caribou, Me. It said the company had increased business activity and load
needs and qualified for the discounts starting at 20% and dropping to 10%
by the fourth year.

SIGECO CREDITS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR WINNING MAJOR NEW TOYOTA PLANT

   Toyota Motor Corp.'s decision to build a $700-million truck assembly
plant near Princeton, Ind., is expected to generate a 25-30 MW electric
load, at least initially, for Southern Indiana Gas & Electric, and if
history is any guide, the load is likely to increase dramatically over the
years.
   SIGECO credited its economic development efforts with contributing to
Toyota's choice of a 1,100-acre site in Gibson County for its new plant
instead of competing sites in Kentucky, Ohio and other parts of Indiana.
All of the site, located along U.S. 41 about 20 miles north of Evansville,
is within SIGECO's service territory. PSI Energy, another IOU, serves an
area just north of the plant site.
   In announcing their selection of the Princeton site, Toyota officials
said the plant would employ 1,300 people and begin producing pickup trucks
in 1998. SIGECO worked closely with the Princeton Chamber of Commerce,
which played a vital role in building a relationship with Toyota, as well
as regional economic development agencies and state government, including
the Indiana Department of Commerce.
   The utility will be building additional transmission facilities,
including a transmission line extension and a new substation, to serve
Toyota. Likewise, SIGECO also will be making similar enhancements to its
natural gas system.
   Although SIGECO would not disclose the plant's projected load, Toyota's
automotive assembly plant near Georgetown, Ky., about 200 miles away,
started out with an approximately 30 MW load in the mid-1980s. Since then,
Toyota has built a second plant at Georgetown, and the site's total load
has mushroomed to 112 MW.
   Kentucky Utilities, which serves the plant, said Toyota's electrical
usage has increased from 166,055,040 kilowatt hours in 1989 to 552,122,640
kilowatt hours in 1994.

WABASH VALLEY REORGANIZES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RATES FOR INDUSTRIALS

   The Wabash Valley Power Assn. has restructured its economic development
rates, replacing its old catch-all EDR-2 rate with three rates designed to
appeal to a broader range of industrial and commercial customers.
   Wabash Valley's three new EDR tariffs were contained in a settlement
agreement recently approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission
(Cause No. 40298). ``In some ways, we're modeling what we're doing on what
PSI/CINergy is doing'' in the area of economic development, said a Wabash
Valley spokesman. PSI Energy is headquartered in Plainfield, Ind., just a
few miles from Wabash Valley's Indianapolis office.
   Under its EDR-2 rate, only new customers with a load in excess of 750 kW
could qualify for its provisions: a demand charge of $10.70/kW for
distribution and $9.70/kW for transmission and an energy charge of 18.81
mills. The discount rate expired after three years. Now, eligible new loads
or existing plant expansions can obtain the revised rates for five years.
   The new EDR-3 rate applies to loads from 300 kW to 749 kW, a load that a
machine shop or Laundromat might have. It carries a demand charge of
$10.72/kW for distribution and $972/kW for transmission and an energy
charge of 18.733 mills.
   The new EDR-4 rate applies to loads from 750 kW to 1.499 MW. It carries
a demand charge of $8.45/kW for distribution and $7.45/kW for transmission
and an energy charge of 17.571 mills. The final rate--EDR-5--applies to
loads in excess of 1.5 MW. This rate is negotiable on a case-by-case
basis.
   Wabash Valley, a generation and transmission cooperative that plans to
emerge in 1997 from more than a decade in Chapter 11 reorganization
proceedings, negotiated the terms of the new tariffs with the state Office
of the Utility Consumer Counselor. Wabash Valley and the OUCC said the new
EDRs are intended to encourage new and expanded industrial and commercial
loads to locate or remain in Indiana.
   ``Based upon this and the evidence presented, the proposed tariffs are
found by this commission to be in the public interest,'' ruled the IURC.
   The Wabash Valley spokesman said the new rates should help the co-op
compete for business against other utilities in a deregulated industry.
``We're stepping up to the plate, and we're going to become as much of a
player in this as anyone else.''

TROUBLED VERDIGRIS VALLEY CO-OP DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

   Verdigris Valley Electric Cooperative, its economic development
subsidiary and four current and former trustees have formally denied
allegations of gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of
state and federal laws or regulations in connection with one of the largest
economic development losses ever sustained by a distribution co-op.
   The allegations were raised in a class action lawsuit filed in October
by Cal McKinney, a member and harsh critic of the Collinsville, Okla.-based
co-op that in October 1993 announced a $5.68-million writeoff from an
economic development loan to Precision Tubulars, a metalworking firm that
went bankrupt without ever reaching full production (District Court of
Tulsa County, Case No. CJ-95-04552) (IEB, 20 Oct, 11).
   McKinney's suit was designed to make co-op members financially whole.
   In his answer on behalf of the co-op, Tulsa attorney Stephen Riley also
asserted that losses from the Precision deal were ``due to circumstances
beyond [the defendants'] control.'' He also asserted that an Oklahoma law
requiring member approval before a co-op can encumber or otherwise dispose
of a ``substantial'' portion of its assets does not apply in this case.
   The co-op admits to loaning Precision $6.79-million, but it denies that
this constituted a substantial portion of its assets. VVEC's current annual
report lists total assets of $57-million.
   Riley also contended that McKinney lacks standing to represent other
co-op members and that the suit is barred by the two-year statute of
limitations. He said McKinney knew or should have known of the losses to
VVEC members before it was officially announced at the October 1993 annual
meeting because of news accounts of Precision's problems starting in 1991.
   Riley said that former general manager Doyle Fulton and five current and
former trustees also named as defendants are not covered by the answer
because they have not yet been officially served with copies of the
lawsuit. An amended answer will be filed once they are served, he said.
   Riley's answer listed nine grounds on which he contends the suit should
be dismissed but also indicated that the defendants acknowledge a need for
further discovery and investigation. No procedural schedule has been set
for the case, but the discovery process is expected to be lengthy and
complex.
   This litigation marks the first time that all aspects of the Precision
deal and VVEC's involvement in it have been subject to court review. A
Washington County civil case involving much narrower issues generated one
of the largest court files in that county's history.

NYPA ASKS PSC TO KEEP OTHER UTILITIES FROM COMPETING ON INDUSTRIAL RATES

   The New York Power Authority (NYPA) has asked the New York Public
Service Commission to prevent other utilities in the state from offering
industrial incentive rates that compete with its economic development
programs. It warns that if investor-owned utilities cut rates to
industrials, other ratepayers will absorb the burden of the lost revenues,
while those customers would suffer no such impact from the NYPA discount
rates.
   Although NYPA mainly supplies wholesale power to utilities and public
agencies, it provides some low-cost power directly to industrials under an
economic development program set up by the state Legislature. This power
comes from the FitzPatrick nuclear plant and is normally given to firms
that pledge to create or retain a certain number of jobs. It runs about 4
cents/kWh, and the industrials must then pay wheeling charges to their
local utilities for delivery.
   NYPA now complains that some utilities are competing with those economic
development rates, and it wants the PSC to stop them. It has asked the
commission to review the economic development tariffs of Rochester Gas &
Electric (Case No. 94-E-0757), Niagara Mohawk Power (Case No. 94-E-0651)
and New York State Electric & Gas (Case No. 94-E-0990).
   In its petition to the PSC, NYPA states, ``The rationale for this
commission having barred the use of flexible rates to compete with
NYPA's...was clear--to avoid a conflict between complimentary state
policies encouraging the expansion and retention of business and to assure
that customers did not unduly benefit by playing suppliers off each other
to obtain discounts subsidized by other customers.''
   NYPA's petition was triggered by a dispute with RG&E over Amplaco Inc.,
a plastic molding company in the Rochester, N.Y., area. In March of this
year, NYPA trustees approved a 350-kW allocation for the firm, which agreed
to create 29 jobs and protect 186 existing positions. The NYPA allocation
was expected to save the firm $49,000 annually on its electric bills. But
in May, Amplaco notified NYPA that it intended to take power from RG&E at
an undisclosed, negotiated rate.
   NYPA responded that, ``Amplaco was satisfied with the rate it had
obtained from the authority and was prepared to make the job commitments
associated therewith. The state's economy therefore gained nothing from
RG&E's flex rate response.''
   RG&E has not formally responded to NYPA's petition, but a utility
spokesman stressed that the company's shareholders will pick up the lost
revenues for the Amplaco discount, not other ratepayers. Nevertheless,
retaining the manufacturer will help other ratepayers because lost load
forces remaining customers to absorb stranded fixed costs. The move will
also benefit the local economy.
   In earlier discussions of the issue, industrial group Multiple
Intervenors had asserted that the PSC should encourage utilities to compete
as much as possible, including with NYPA. The group is not actively
involved in the NYPA-RG&E dispute.
