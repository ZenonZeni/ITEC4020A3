<B>Minister Signs Licence for 1996 Family Fishing Weekend</B>
</CENTER><P>

Ontario Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today signed the documents that will enable the 1996 Ontario Family Fishing Weekend to take place across the province in early July.<P>

The documents were signed at the Ontario Out Of Doors 1996 Fishing Show in Toronto.  The Ontario Family Fishing Weekend is designed to encourage participation in recreational fishing, especially by Ontarians who have never or seldom fished.<P>

"During the weekend of July 5 to 7, the people of Ontario and other Canadians will have a unique opportunity to enjoy recreational fishing without having to buy a licence," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The Family Fishing Weekend is becoming a tradition in Ontario. It gives people who only thought about fishing an opportunity to try it and to learn about conservation and rehabilitation of Ontario's fishing resources."<P>

The weekend is made possible through the work of a steering committee comprising of representatives from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Association of Conservation Authorities of Ontario, the Canadian National Sportsfishing Foundation, Resorts Ontario, and representatives from the tourism and tackle industries.<P>

"The Family Fishing Weekend is a fine example of partnership at work," said Mr. Hodgson.  "All partners on the steering committee contribute expertise and significant resources to make this a perfect weekend for all Ontarians to enjoy fishing."<P>

This is the third consecutive year that MNR and its partners are offering the licence-free fishing weekend.  Studies done last year show that in addition to providing excellent recreational and educational opportunities, the event brought more people out to fish.  This should stimulate the fishing and tourism industries across the province in the long run.<P>

The Fishing Show, where today's signing ceremony took place, is being held until February 18 at the International Centre in Mississauga.  It is an annual event with promotional activities and displays that attracts some 40,000 anglers.<P>
