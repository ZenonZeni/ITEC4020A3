<h1><font SIZE=+4>Marijuana as medicine </font></h1>

<h1><font SIZE=+2>Why should it be different from other pain-relieving
drugs?
<br>Vote yes on Proposition 215</font><font SIZE=+1> </font></h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Look in the medicine cabinet of a person who suffers from
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spasticity or chronic pain: It's filled with dangerous
drugs. Doctors are allowed to prescribe these drugs -- including morphine
and cocaine -- despite the risk of abuse. Sick people are allowed to take
mind-altering drugs that would be illegal if used by the healthy. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Except for marijuana. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Californians should vote yes on Proposition 215, which
would let doctors recommend marijuana without fear of criminal prosecution,
and let sick people grow it and possess it, if recommended by a doctor.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Many doctors believe marijuana is highly effective in
relieving nausea and stimulating appetite -- important for cancer and AIDS
patients -- and in relieving pressure that blinds glaucoma patients. Marijuana
is also used to ease muscle spasms, and to help people manage chronic pain.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The ban on medical marijuana is &quot;scientifically,
legally and morally wrong,&quot; argues Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a Harvard
medical professor. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrative
law judge, Frank Young, recommended that doctors be allowed to prescribe
marijuana: &quot;It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for
the DEA to continue to stand between sufferers and the benefit of this
substance.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Drug warriors persist in claiming that marijuana has no
medical value and they've blocked studies that might prove them wrong.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Doctors can prescribe Marinol, a pill containing THC,
the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. However, patients can't tailor
the dose to their needs, because the capsule contains a liquid, and can't
be split. Because it's pure THC, Marinol can make patients so high they
can't function. For those with nausea, it's difficult to swallow a large
Marinol capsule, and keep it down. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>By contrast, patients can smoke as much or as little marijuana
as they need, getting the medical benefits with minimal psychoactive effects.
Those who don't like to smoke can eat marijuana cookies or brownies. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The only real argument against letting sick people use
marijuana is that it might sanction the use of marijuana by people who
just want to get high. It's not a persuasive argument. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Criminalizing medical marijuana hasn't stopped kids from
getting marijuana, or using it. Kids also abuse their parents' prescriptions
for tranquilizers and anti- depressants, and their friends' prescriptions
for Ritalin, but nobody's talking about making Prozac illegal because it
might be abused. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 is on the ballot not because a few leftover
hippies from the '60s want to get high. It's there because thousands of
people with AIDS organized to fight for useful drugs. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The initiative doesn't legalize marijuana use by healthy
people. It doesn't legalize &quot;engaging in conduct that endangers others.&quot;
Essentially, it lets law-abiding people seek relief from pain and illness
without feeling like criminals. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Vote yes on Proposition 215. </font></p>
