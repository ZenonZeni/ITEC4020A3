It's Takeoff Time For Two Powerful Airline Cards


The fleet of airline cobranded cards got two new members this month that
promise to raise the stakes in a high-flying market.  On Jan.  4, American
Express Co.'s Centurion Bank and Delta Air Lines released details of their
much-anticipated Delta SkyMiles Optima frequent-flyer program.  Then, on Jan.
9, American Airlines and the Air Travel Card, the airline industry's
60-year-old travel payment system, announced the launch of the American
Airlines AAsset Card.  It is a cobranded MasterCard that can be used both as a
corporate air travel card and multi-purpose travel-and-entertainment card.  It
is being issued under a partnership between Air Travel Card and GE Capital
Financial Inc.

Just what impact these new cards will have on the business
travel-and-entertainment market is unknown.  But they bring major new players
into an already fiercely competitive game.

"Folks realize there's a lot of money being spent on business travel," says
Michele Turkel, president of Spectrum International Consulting Corp.,
Scarsdale, N.Y.  "There's going to be a lot of new travel products."

Both new cobranded airline cards face an uphill battle.  The Delta SkyMiles
Optima card is a late entrant in the frequent-flyer arena, and must offer a
unique rewards package to make it stand out from other products already
well-established in the marketplace, observers say.  Indeed, American Express
makes no secret it is trying to lure away cardholders from Visa and MasterCard
cobranded frequent-flyer card programs by offering incentives for
Delta-related purchases, points that never expire and bonus points for
carrying balances.  "This is the credit card product our customers have been
asking us for," says Brian Kleinberg, AmEx's senior vice president of new
product development.  It is the first ever cobranded card for Delta, although
the airline has long participated in AmEx's Membership Rewards loyalty program
(CCN, Sept.  1, 1995).

Delta and AmEx expect the card to bring in more than 500,000 new members to
the SkyMiles program over the next five years, says Paul Matsen, Delta's vice
president of advertising and consumer marketing.  SkyMiles currently has 18
million members.

The SkyMiles card offers 1.5 SkyMiles for every dollar spent on Delta Air
Lines and Delta Connection tickets as well as Delta Dream vacations, and one
mile per dollar on all other purchases.  The card also differs from other
frequent-flyer cards in that there is no expiration date on using the points
as long as the cardholder travels on a Delta or Delta Connection Flight every
three years.  American Express will issue a gold version of the SkyMiles
Optima later this year.

The Delta SkyMiles card also rewards cardholders for carrying a balance-0.2
SkyMiles for each dollar spent on new purchases.  This could give an AmEx a
profitability edge in a market whose customers are notorious for their
reluctance to revolve balances.

The SkyMiles card carries an introductory interest rate of 8.9% for the first
six months and then converts to the prime rate (currently 8.5%) plus 9.4%.
The card carries a $55 annual fee which is waived for all primary AmEx green,
gold and platinum card holders.  The annual cap on SkyMiles accumulation is
$60,000 in charges.  Bonuses for Delta purchases are exempt from the limit.

"This card was really developed for people who fly Delta, want to earn
frequent-flyer miles and like the financial flexibility of being able to carry
a balance from time to time," says Mary Miller, AmEx's senior vice president
of partnership sales and relationships.  She says extra SkyMiles are awarded
to revolvers not to encourage cardholders to carry a balance but to compensate
revolvers because "they are carrying a heavier financial load" because of
interest payments.  "We thought we'd give back something," she says.  "We
don't think it encourages anybody to revolve if they weren't revolving
otherwise."

But some observers say most non-revolvers wouldn't be interested in the Delta
SkyMiles card because they can earn points on AmEx's other charge cards
through its Membership Rewards program.  "If I already have Membership
Rewards, what's the added benefit for convenience users?"  asks Anne Morgan
Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based consulting
firm.

However, American Express views the Delta SkyMiles card as a complementary
product to its charge cards, Miller adds.  "Our research tells us people like
to segregate their spending, particularly business travelers, our core target
group," she says.

And though charge card holders who participate in Membership Rewards also can
accumulate frequent-flyer miles on Delta, Miller says the SkyMiles Optima
isn't expected to harm that program.  "They're different value propositions,"
she says, noting that Membership Rewards is aimed at cardholders who don't
revolve balances.

There are mixed reviews on the SkyMiles Optima, with some observers saying
AmEx missed the opportunity to develop a truly unique frequent-flyer product.
"I think it's terribly disappointing," Turkel says.  "They waited 10 years to
come out with this product and they come out with something that won't break
through the clutter."

But others disagree.  "American Express definitely pulled off a coup," says
James L.  Accomando, president of Fairfield, Conn.-based Accomando Consulting
Inc.  He notes that the Delta SkyMiles Optima is "very rich" in benefits
compared to other frequent-flyer cards.  For example, most other programs
offer only one point for every dollar spent and put a three-year-limit for
redeeming frequent-flyer miles.

In addition, the $55 annual fee is comparable to those on other AmEx products
while it falls in the middle range of what other issuers charge for their
frequent-flyer cards, Accomando says.  But the richness of the benefits could
prove to be an Achilles' Heel in the long run, he adds, saying, "a program
like this is very expensive to manage.  The users are transactors-they're not
necessarily people who roll over balances."

The Delta SkyMiles card is one more step in American Express' goal of reaching
$30 billion in outstandings by the year 2000.

The SkyMiles Optima is one of two cobranded offerings from American Express.
Last October, AmEx introduced the no-fee Hilton Optima card (CCN, Sept.  15,
1995).  Miller says there may be some overlap between the two cards' bases
since both target frequent travelers.

The SkyMiles Optima card was officially launched Jan.  5 with a television,
print and outdoor advertising as well as a direct-mail campaign.  Delta and
Delta Connection carriers operate more than 4,800 flights daily to 297 cities
in 48 states and 29 countries around the world.  American Express in late
August announced it would launch a cobranded card with Delta, but didn't
release details of the program until a Jan.  4 press conference.

But frequent-flyer card programs are only one area seeing increased
competition.  Corporate air card programs-in which a corporation is billed
centrally for all it airline expenses-also are facing some new competition.
Through an agreement with GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of GE Capital Services, Air Travel Card will be able provides its seven major
U.S.  airlines that issue the card with the banking, billing and reporting
services needed to offer a comprehensive cobranded card for
travel-and-entertainment expenses, says Charles B.  Fischer, Air Travel Card
managing director.  American Airlines-which also offers the AAdvantage
frequent-flyer card issued by Citibank-is the first air carrier to offer the
card.

More than 100,000 corporations, including half of the Fortune 500, use the Air
Travel Card.  More than 200 airlines accept it.

Air Travel Card sought a partnership with GE Capital because of airlines'
requests for a multi-purpose card that could serve as a corporate air, T&E and
calling card, Fischer says.

Under the program, the participating airline will do central billing for the
air charges while GE Capital will handle billing for all non-air expenditures,
says Mark Meythaler, American Airlines manager of credit card marketing.
Billing services can be customized if corporations prefer to have all charges
on one bill.  The cobranded T&E market is likely to get more crowded before
the year is out.  A recent Synergistics' report notes that more and more
issuers are looking to frequent-flyer programs as a means of enhancing cards
to compete with the proliferation of value-added cards on the market.

"I think we're going to see many more cobranded cards," says Randy Petersen,
editor and publisher of InsideFlyer.  "The Delta program is only the second of
at least two to three more cobranded card to be launched by the end of 1996."

Worsening Credit Quality Casts a Pall Over the New Year


Analysts predicted a decline in consumer credit quality most of last year.
Now for a not-so-happy New Year's gift:  Those predictions are coming true.
Example:  Moody's Investors Service's most recent index of securities backed
by card receivables shows U.S.  consumer credit quality in the third quarter
of 1995 slipping, the first quarterly dip in three years.

According to Moody's, chargeoffs in the pool of securities it rates rose to
4.14% of outstandings in the third quarter from 3.99% in the third quarter of
1994.  For September, the chargeoff rate increased to 4.27% of outstandings
from 3.83% in September 1994, the sharpest year-over-year increase since
January 1992.  Moody's tracks $109 billion in securitized outstandings from 74
issuers.

Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst Edward O.  Bankole blames the boost
on the recent upturn in consumer bankruptcy filings.  Nonbusiness bankruptcy
filings in the third quarter rose for the second consecutive quarter, to
220,945, from 195,308 in the third quarter of 1994, a 13.1% increase,
according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts.  Some observers
say personal bankruptcy filings could hit or pass 900,000 when figures for
1995 are tallied.  That would be the most since 1992, when there were 900,874
filings.

Delinquencies in Moody's pool of securitized receivables averaged 4.08% in the
third quarter of 1995, compared with 4.37% a year earlier, Moody's says.  But
Bankole says the rate is distorted by the continuing rapid growth in credit
card loans, which reached $299 billion in June 1995, up 28% from June 1994,
according to the data from Visa, MasterCard and Discover.

The trend is being noticed by other observers.  According to the American
Bankers Association, total delinquent dollars outstanding rose to 4.21% of
outstandings in the third quarter, from 3.58% in the second quarter and from
2.90% in the third quarter of 1994.

Some industry observers blame the increase in delinquencies on the surge in
bankruptcies as well as the continued aggressive marketing of credit card
offers.

The number of personal bankruptcy filings for 1995 will near historic levels,
Stuart Feldstein, president of Budd Lake, N.J.-based SMR Research Inc..  This
is troubling to issuers because bankruptcies account for roughly 40% of
chargeoffs.  According to the latest figures from the Administrative Office of
the U.S.  Courts, there were 832,415 filings between Oct.  1, 1994 and Sept.
30, 1995.

Some point to increasing consumer debt loads at a time of slow wage growth as
another factor in rising delinquencies.  The amount of revolving credit alone
rose 19.1% in the third quarter over the year-earlier period, according to
Federal Reserve figures.  Meanwhile, wage growth, and thus the ability to pay
off some of that debt, rose only 5.1% during the same period.

Intense competition among issuers also has been driving down credit quality as
they scrape to get their cards in the hands of as many consumers as possible.
In the push to keep portfolios humming, some issuers are relaxing their
standards and issuing cards to riskier customers, observers say..

Other observers say the continuing decline in credit quality is a correction
for the rapid growth of card portfolios in the early 1990s.  Chargeoff rates
"are seeking their proper levels," says Michael E.  Staten, director of Purdue
University's Credit Research Center.

The Strange Phenomenon Of Overpaying Credit Card Bills


The practice of overpayment of credit card bills came under scrutiny recently
when fraudsters allegedly used the tactic to defraud 120 issuers out of about
$40 million(CCN, Dec.  15, 1995).  Issuers say the practice is longstanding
but rare, and they say there are legitimate reasons cardholders would make
payments in excess of their credit limits.

Overpayment can expose an issuer to fraud.  Because of banking laws, issuers
are required to post the checks and credit the funds as soon as they are
received.  This allows the crooks to take large cash advances and go on
spending sprees before the checks are returned as insufficient.

But there is a small percentage of cardholders who occasionally will make a
payment over their credit limits, issuers say.  This is usually to prevent
getting behind on payments or to anticipate purchases that might exceed credit
limits while traveling over extended periods.

Industry sources have no figures on how many legitimate customers pay their
accounts above the credit limit.  "It's very rare," says a spokesperson for
Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T Universal Card Services.

But is there really a need for customers to increase their credit limits by
overpaying?  No, says Chris N.  Theoharides, principal of Theoharides
Consulting, Massapequa, N.Y.  Banks have made it easy to get credit line
increases thanks to toll-free numbers.  And risk scores allow banks to quickly
judge if the cardholder is worthy of an increase.  Adds Bill Dobbins, vice
president of fraud operations at Chase Manhattan Bank:  "Why give an issuer
money that's not collecting interest?  You can pay while you're away through
fund transfers or have someone handle your affairs."

Issuers interviewed say they will accept an overpayment-but with caution.
Cincinnati-based Star Banc Corp.  allows cardholders to overpay and have a
balance, says Senior Vice President Collin G.  McKenny.

"But we watch that because that's one of the tricks of the bad guys," McKenny
says.

AT&T says it handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis.  "If a cardholder
won't be where their mail is and will be doing some spending, we ask them to
let us know ahead of time," the spokesperson says.

One indication that a prepayment is legitimate is that a bill coupon
accompanies it, says the AT&T spokesperson.  But depending on how far over the
credit limit the check is, Chase, AT&T and Advanta say they may call the
cardholder's bank ahead of time before posting the funds.

If a check is received above a credit limit, Key Federal Savings Bank will
post the check but hold some of the money from availability until the bank is
"reasonably certain" the check will clear the bank from which it is written,
says Robert M.  Bouza, president of operations.  The move is done only in
certain cases where the customer is believed to be high-risk and is not
against banking laws.  "If a check bounces, you've given away the available
balance-plus," he says.  "You're out of a heck of a lot of money."

Chase's Dobbins says the bank will credit the account, but also will call the
bank the check is issued from to check the validity of the payment, he says.

Overpayment is not always a prelude to fraud, but it should set off warning
bells, depending on how far over a customer's credit limit a check is, Dobbins
says.  Fraud experts say a sure warning sign is a check that is mailed with no
coupon in an overnight mail envelope.

"Someone with a $5,000 credit limit that owes us $1,000 and pays us $1,000
isn't unusual," Dobbins says.  "But someone who owes us $1,000, but pays us
$10,000 causes a lot of bells to go off," Dobbins says.

Behind the Growth of Penalties For Rental Car No-Shows


Visa U.S.A., American Express Travel Related Services Co.  and Dean Witter,
Discover & Co.  all are now offering guaranteed car-rental reservation and
no-show penalties for rental companies during peak periods.  Problem:  These
appear to be services no one needs.

Visa and AmEx rolled out their services in December.  A Discover spokesperson
says the issuer has offered similar services since last May.  But no major
rental companies have signed on to any of the three companies' plans, though
spokespersons from Alamo, Value and Thrifty car-rental agencies say they are
considering them.

Ironically, Visa and AmEx say the services are in response to requests from
the car-rental industry trying to combat a chronic no-show problem.  Some
industry estimates peg no-shows at as much as 70% of reservations in some
cities during peak periods, such as three-day holiday weekends.

Anticipation

However, executives from Visa and AmEx say they are confident that companies
will climb on board soon.

Participation in the programs is voluntary.  Under the services, car-rental
companies first must agree to offer guaranteed reservations to customers along
with penalty fees.  Customers then would be offered the choice of making a
standard reservation as they currently do, or guaranteeing a reservation under
the new guidelines.  If a customer accepts the guaranteed reservation, he then
agrees to authorize Visa, AmEx or Discover to charge penalty fees if he fails
to show up or call to cancel within a specified time period.  It is the rental
company's responsibility to charge the fee.

Under Visa's program, cardholders who guarantee their car rentals during peak
periods with a Visa card, are guaranteed a car will be waiting at their
destination for up to eight hours from their expected arrival time.  In the
event of an overbooking, the rental agency is required to rent a comparable
vehicle from another agency and deliver it to the cardholder.  Customers must
cancel eight hours prior to pick-up to avoid a charge for up to a one-day
rental.  In case of a flight cancellation, cardholders have up to one hour
prior to the scheduled pick-up time to cancel.

American Express offers its customers similar guarantees..  Cardholders will
be assured a car will be held for them for at least 12 hours from their
scheduled arrival time.  If the agency overbooks, the rental agency must
provide a comparable vehicle from another firm.

AmEx cardholders must cancel within 48 hours prior to their scheduled pickup
time to avoid as much as a two-day rental charge.  If the customer's flight is
canceled, the penalty is waived.

Discover officials would not discuss their services, except to say a car would
be guaranteed for 24 hours and that a customer would be charged up to a
24-hour rental fee if he didn't show up without a cancellation.

Bad Feelings

But a major obstacle to car-rental agencies implementing the new services is
that penalties may create ill will with customers.  "If a business traveler
gets a flight canceled, they have to make a lot more calls than to just the
rental agencies," says Hertz Corp.  Vice President of Governmental Affairs
Joseph N.  Russo.  Rental agencies currently do not impose penalty fees for
no-shows who reserve conventional cars.  Hertz is not opposed to penalty fees
but objects to the idea of having such fees mandated by credit card companies,
Russo says.  Hertz and Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis impose no-show penalties
for so-called special equipment, such as convertibles or four-wheel-drive
vehicles that are high in demand.

A Post-Holiday Lull in Direct-Mail Campaigns


Most issuers stayed on the sidelines in the waning days of 1995 and the
opening days of 1996.  Faulkner & Gray researchers in New York, Chicago and
Washington received only 38 solicitations in the weeks following the Christmas
and New Year holidays.

Among the most active mailers was MBNA America Bank, which hit the mails with
a wide variety of offers for everyone from wine aficionados to veterinarians
and physical therapists.  It also used the Northwestern University football
team's trip to the Rose Bowl as an opportunity to boost the university's
alumni group affinity card.

Bank of Boston, which re-entered the card business after a five-year absence,
also was promoting its Visa Gold card carrying an APR of prime plus 3.756% and
a $28 annual fee.

Diners Club Guns for AmEx in New Ad Campaign


Stiff competition in the travel-and-entertainment arena is causing normally
tame Citicorp Diners Club to bare its teeth.  And in public.  Last month,
Diners took a swipe at T&E giant American Express Co.'s revamped Membership
Rewards program in ads that ran in major newspapers.

The ad headline boasts, "If your rewards program is missing two major
airlines, it's probably still green," and bears a facsimile of an AmEx green
charge card.  Though not naming the carriers, the ad refers to American and
United airlines, which participate in Diners Club's loyalty mileage program,
but not in AmEx's.

"The renamed American Express rewards program promises the frequent business
traveler 'a world of choices," the ad reads.  "The truth is, it doesn't even
cover the continent."

Standing Up

Diners executives say the ad is part of a more aggressive marketing campaign
the issuer is launching.  Additionally, they say the new name AmEx chose for
its loyalty program last year-Membership Rewards-is a little too close in name
to their Club Rewards program.  And they want everyone to know it.  "When AmEx
comes out and copies our name, we have to stand up and be counted," a Diners
spokesperson says.  "We wanted to remind readers that AmEx has an inferior
program."

Diners Club finished the year with about seven million cardholders and charge
volume around $25 billion.  That pales in comparison to the 37 million AmEx
cardholders and charge volume of roughly $150 billion.

The Best?

AmEx executives defend their loyalty program, saying it offers cardholders
much more variety and utility.  The program has been honored as the best
international program for flexibility and variety by InsideFlyer, a Colorado
Springs, Colo.-based travel magazine.  "We're confident our program is the
best," an AmEx spokesperson says.  "The fact that it is recognized by premier
travel publications speaks for itself."

The Diners Club ad and its aggressive stance is unusual, but laudable for the
issuer, says Randy Petersen, InsideFlyer's editor and publisher.  "There have
been some changes in attitude and they are for the better," he says of Diners'
new ad campaign.  "I'm a big fan of AmEx, but Diners' comparison is true."

While Diners' ad makes a legitimate product distinction, it could backfire,
says Richard N.  Kimmel, principal of Kimmel & Co., a Chicago-based
advertising firm.  The ad makes Diners appear petty , "and being petty does
not look good," he says.

"If I had an American Express Card, I might be interested in the airlines that
aren't participating, but the ad doesn't tell me," Kimmel says.  "I don't
think this ad does them a lot of good.  It sounds desperate because it is
strident, untrustworthy and irritating."

Won't Back Down

The Diners spokesperson denies the ad is an act of desperation.  "Not at all,"
the spokesperson says.  But Diners will not back down from American Express
even though it has a fraction of AmEx's advertising budget.  "Our pockets are
not as deep as theirs so we have to muster up," the spokesperson says.

The chances of AmEx bringing American and United into its fold may be slim.
American has a long-standing contractual relationship for the purchase of the
airline miles offered through Diners Club cards and the Citi-American Airlines
cobranded card.  United has a similar cobranding arrangement with First
Chicago, but could join AmEx when the current contract expires, Petersen says.

Carlson, Household Become Traveling Companions


Since 1991, Salinas, Calif.-based Household Credit Services, the card-issuing
arm of Household International, has steadily cultivated its corporate bank
card portfolio.  The program has grown to more than 126,000 cards at the
beginning of 1995, making it the second largest corporate bank card file, from
a paltry 4,200 at the end of 1991.  Now Household has taken another step some
observers say will give its program a major boost and make a splash on the
travel-and-entertainment scene:  the issuing of a cobranded corporate card
with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the Minneapolis-based travel agency giant.

The card, appropriately dubbed The Business Card, is the first corporate card
offered by a travel agency, and one of the first cobranded corporate travel
cards, Household executives say.  Initially, it will be marketed to companies
with commercial travel accounts of $1 million or more.  A version for smaller
corporate accounts will be rolled out in mid- to late-1996.

Tracking Expenses

The Business Card will be a general-purpose bank card, available as a
MasterCard or Visa.  It will offer a variety of spending limits and travel
insurance packages.  Companies can either use computer modules to compile
expense reports from the card in-house or outsource it to Carlson.  The fee
for each card and interest rate will be announced later.

As part of the venture, Household and Carlson Wagonlit will produce a joint
proprietary management information system (MIS) data base that they claim will
offer companies more detailed information than other corporate cards about
airlines, hotels and car rentals employees use.  Like traditional expense
reports, it will allow companies to track costs as well as identify the most
frequently used travel vendors, says Ron Muratore, director of planning and
communications for Household's credit card group.  "It is a management tool
that captures more data and presents businesses with a bigger and better
picture on how their money is spent," he says.

Carlson Wagonlit executives say the new card will offer more information and
better integration with a cli-ent's expense reporting system than competitors,
but would not discuss specifics.  "Our whole plan is smooth integration with
other corporate travel systems as well as providing the information that's
needed to manage the travel expense activity," says Terry L.  Thelemann,
Carlson Wagonlit director of marketing product services.  "We don't want our
customers to jump through a lot of hoops to get the advantage of the card."

But executives from Citicorp Diners Club and American Express Co.  say there
is nothing new about the Household-Carlson venture.  Spokespersons from both
companies say they provide detailed, yet easy-to-interpret MIS reports and
software allowing companies to receive the reports on-line.

Major Player

Some observers say the new card could swiftly be a major player in the T&E
arena.  "Anytime two giants like Household and Carlson join, it will draw
attention," says Donald J.  Auriemma, chairman of the Westbury, N.Y.-based
Auriemma Consulting Group.  "They are both leaders in their respective
fields."

The fee per card will vary on how the customer wants to structure its expense
reports, Muratore says.

The program will be launched in the U.S.  and Canada during the first quarter.

First Bank and Target Aim For A Cobranded Bull's Eye


Dayton Hudson Corp.'s discount chain Target Stores Inc.  and First Bank System
Inc.  will launch a cobranded card later this month.  The Target Rewards Visa,
believed to be the first issued by a major discount retailer, will have no
annual fee and will offer rebates at Target stores.  Details on the rewards
program and interest rates won't be disclosed until the card's launch near the
end of this month.

Target, which last January began issuing the Target Guest private-label card
in selected markets (CCN, Oct.  1, 1995), decided to start a cobranded program
to give its customers a "more utilitarian card," a spokesperson says.  "It
allows people who are pretty loyal to Target to use the card at other
merchants.  It's a unique opportunity to build Target loyalty."

The cobranded card isn't expected to draw customers away from Target's
private-label portfolio, the Target spokesperson says.  The Guest Card is
issued by Dayton Hudson's Retailers National Bank, Sioux Falls, S.D., which
issues only private-label cards.

Initially, the card will be issued only in Florida and Indiana, where the
chain has a total of 83 stores.  The program will be rolled out gradually to
other states over the next year, the spokesperson says.  Target has 673 stores
in 33 states.  The discount retailer serves over 1 million shoppers per day.

The Target Rewards Visa is expected to generate about $2 billion in
receivables and a return on assets in excess of 2% by 1998, says Philip G.
Heasley, vice chairman of First Bank System.  First Bank, which also issues
cobranded cards with Northwest Airlines and AmWay.

Merger Mania Spreads To Issuers on The East Coast


Merger mania shows no sign of slowing down as banks continue buying one
another, perhaps to avoid being swallowed up themselves.  Toward the end of
last year, the trend swept up the East Coast.  Last month, Bank of Boston
announced it will buy Boston-based BayBanks, while Providence, R.I.-based
Fleet Financial Group announced it will buy the U.S.  operations of
British-based National Westminster (NatWest) Bank.

The Bank of Boston/BayBanks merger will mean a major boost to Bank of Boston's
reborn credit card program.  After re-entering the card business last
September after selling its portfolio to Chase Manhattan five years ago, Bank
of Boston ended 1995 with 102,000 accounts and $124 million in receivables,
says Bank of Boston Director of Credit Cards Services Jeff Slawsky.
Acquisition of BayBanks' portfolio will add 278,000 accounts and $300 million
in receivables.  "This will make us bigger, quicker," he says.

Pending completion of the Bank of Boston/BayBanks merger, Bank of Boston plans
to begin issuing nationally, Slawsky says.  BayBanks' card program has a
strong presence in New England.  "We plan on being a pretty aggressive
issuer," he says.  Details on how the two portfolios will be merged have not
been determined.

Farther south, NatWest's U.S.  Group had been for sale since last September.
Fleet reported 1.1 million accounts and $1.5 billion in receivables at
year-end 1994, while NatWest reported 826,590 accounts and $1.1 billion in
receivables, according to Faulkner & Gray's 1996 Card Industry Directory.
