RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION: HISTOGRAMS
</H1>
<I>
This document was created in response to the number of questions 
concerning radiometric calibration. This document was prepared by <A 
HREF="mailto:tlogan@images.alaska.edu">Tom Logan</A> to help answer some 
of these questions. To help explain radiometric calibration, this 
document follows the same procedures as our software program 
<B>calibrate</B>. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Tom.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Before any image to image comparisons can be performed with ASF SAR
images, the data values must be converted to backscatter (s0).  This
process, known as radiometric calibration, converts image data values into
scene independent backscatter values.  This facilitates mosaicking and
animation of SAR images by removing inter- and intra-scene differences
related to the radar transfer characteristics, leaving images that are
self-consistent and consistent with others of the same area. 

<P>

With each calibrated ASF SAR image product, a radiometric data record is
included in the CEOS metadata structures.  This record contains the
calibration coefficients and a table of Noise versus Range values.  These
<A HREF="cal_fig1.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="[Figure
1]"></A> are utilized by the STEP software tool calibrate which applies
the look up table and calibration cofficients, performs log to linear
conversion, and creates a byte valued output image.  Given an input
image's histogram, we will track what changes calibrate makes to the
histogram in creating the output image.  We take our example image to be
that of Fairbanks, image ID 17972. The data range of <A
HREF="cal_fig1.gif">figure 1</A> is from 37 to 255. 

<P>

Conversion of a data number to backscatter value requires applying noise
scaling, linear conversion, and value offsets.  These coefficients
(a1,a2,a3) are calculated at image creation and can be found at the
beginning of the radiometric calibration recor d.  The conversion of data
value, d, to backscatter in units of dB uses the equation,

<CENTER>
s0 = 10*log10[a2 * ( d * d - a1 * n(r) ) + a3]
</CENTER>

where n(r) is the noise versus range function.  s0 values are then scaled
to byte values within a specified range.

<H2>Calibration Coefficients</H2>

In applying the calibration coefficients, we change the data histogram. 
In particular, the squaring operation stretches out the set of possible
values, so that evenly spaced histogram bins collect different numbers of
squared values.  Here is a simple e xample.  Suppose the original data
take on the values 0,1,2,...,10, with uniform distribution.  Then the
squares can have values 0,1,4,9,16,...,100.  If we make a histogram with a
bin size of 10, then the relative number of values in each bin will be:
4,1 ,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1 (e.g. there are no perfect squares in the interval
from 50 to 60).  So we get positive spikes at the low end of the histogram
and negative spikes at the high end, as observed in the calibrated SAR
data.  Graphically, here is the same example but with values from 1 to
255, uniformly distributed. (See <A HREF="cal_fig2.gif">Figure 2</A> and 
<A HREF="cal_fig3.gif">Figure 3</A>).

<H2>Noise Versus Range Look Up Table</H2>

&quot;The noise in the image varies with range due to the internal
radiometric compensation for antenna pattern, range to target, and
incidence angle.  Accurate conversion to backscatter requires subtraction
of the noise...&quot;

For each ASF image, a look up table (LUT) of noise vs. range values is
created.  The full resolution ASF ERS-1 image has 8192 range samples per
line, but only 256 values are included in the table.  The same table is
used for the low resolution images as for the full resolution.  Thus,
interpolation from one data point to another in the table is required. 
Suppose we have ns range samples in our data set.  Then given a LUT of 256
values (rdr.noise[0-255]), each LUT value must be used for ns / 256 data
sam ples.  For a given sample number, <I>r</I>, we set

<P>

<PRE>
 	ispace = ns / 256	
	base   = r / ispace
	delta  = r mod ispace
</PRE>

then,

<PRE>
	 		        (rdr.noise[base+1]-rdr.noise[base])
     n(r) = rdr.noise[base] +  -------------------------------------  * delta
		                  	       ispace
</PRE>

interpolates the look up table values for this sample number.

<P>

After application of the calibration coefficients and the noise vs. range
LUT, the data histogram is that shown in the Intermediate 1 figure (see 
<A HREF="#fig5">figure 5</A>).

<H2>Logarithm To Linear Conversion</H2>
	
Performing the log10 operation also modifies the appearance of the data
histogram.  An example of this change is graphically illustrated below. 
Given an even distribution of 1 occurrence of the numbers from 0.0015 to
0.3825 (stepping by 0.0015), we get the histogram on the left. (See <A
HREF="cal_fig6.gif">Figure 6</A>.) Taking the log10 of these numbers, we
end up with the histogram on the right. <A HREF="cal_fig7.gif">Figure
7</A>.)

<P>
<A HREF="cal_fig6.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig6.gif" ALT="[Figure 6]"></A>
<A HREF="cal_fig7.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig7.gif" ALT="[Figure 7]"></A>
<P>

Obviously, this operation compacts the data, so that evenly spaced bins
collect different numbers of data occurences.  We end up with large holes
where no bins were hit and a ramping at the positive end of the data.  In
effect, this nearly reverses the appearance of the histogram, as we can
see by comparing the intermediate 1 histogram above with the intermediate
2 histogram below. (See <A HREF="cal_fig8.gif">Figure 8.</A>)

<H2>Scaling Values To Byte Quantities</H2>

After the calibration coefficients have been applied, the data is next
scaled to byte quantities within the minimum and maximum s0 range.  By
default this range is Dmin = -25.5 to Dmax = 0.0 This final quantization
takes place as folows: 

<PRE>
	   /
	       | Dmax					if s0 > Dmax
     o  =      | Dmin					if s0 < Dmin
	       | (s0 - Dmin)/(Dmax-Dmin)*255+0.5	Otherwise
	   \

In conclusion, if you've noticed that your SAR data histograms are
changing when you perform radiometric calibration using the ASF STEP tool
calibrate, don't panic.  In performing the non-linear operations of
squaring, applying the noise vs. range f unction, and taking the log10 of
the data, the histogram is supposed to be changed...
