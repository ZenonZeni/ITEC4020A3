<H2><CITE>Veteran Algerian Reporter Assassinated</H2>
<STRONG>
</CITE></STRONG>
<hr>
<BR>
NEW YORK -- The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan 
advocate of press freedoms, vigorously condemned today's murder of Djilali Arabdiou, 
a reporter and photographer with the pro-government weekly <CITE>Alg&eacuterie  Actualit&eacute</cite> Arabdiou is the sixth journalist murdered in Algeria this year and the 58th victim 
of an ongoing campaign targeting the Algerian media for assassination.<BR>
<BR>
"This murderous campaign against journalists in Algeria is the most lethal documented 
by CPJ in the last 10 years," said Avner Gidron, CPJ's research director. <BR>
<BR>
Unidentified men shot and killed Arabdiou this morning in Ain Naadja, a southwestern 
suburb of Algiers. Arabdiou was considered the dean of Algerian photojournalists, 
his colleagues told CPJ. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing. But 
Islamic fundamentalist rebels are presumed responsible. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) 
has claimed responsibility for the bulk of journalists' slayings in Algeria.<BR>
<BR>
As many as 40,000 people have died in the Algerian conflict. But the 58 journalists 
killed since May 1993 have all been deliberately targeted, not killed in cross fire, 
in a concerted campaign to assassinate secular intellectuals and professionals.<BR>
<BR>
While the greatest threat to the journalistic profession comes from armed opponents 
of the government, the regime itself has done much to hinder the work of journalists. 
Last month Algerian editors were ordered by the government to submit all unofficial 
reports about violence to a censor. Newspapers are only allowed to carry stories about 
the security situation that have been supplied by the official Algerian Press Service. 
Since the army interrupted the electoral process in January 1992 to prevent a victory by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in parliamentary elections, 
 many independent journalists have been dragged to court, newspapers have been suspended, 
and the state's monopoly on printing has been used to intimidate publishers.<BR>
<BR>
CPJ's annual report <CITE>Attacks on the Press in 1995, </cite>which documents in detail the assassination of Algerian journalists by extremists 
and instances of government censorship of the press, will be released on March 14, 
in Washington, DC.<BR>
 <BR>
Attached is a list, documented by CPJ, of the 58 journalists killed in Algeria since 
May 1993. <BR>
