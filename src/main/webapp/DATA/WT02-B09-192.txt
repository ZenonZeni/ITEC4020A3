<h2>EDITORIAL -- Puritanical Prejudice Vs. Medical Science </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>FOR THE THIRD YEAR in a row, the state Legislature has
passed a humane bill that would allow seriously ill patients to use marijuana
for medicinal purposes. Unfortunately, Governor Wilson is expected to veto
it, also for the third time. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>By any reasonable standard, marijuana should be a welcome
addition to the pharmacopoeia of drugs for treatment of such dreadful diseases
as glaucoma, cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis. After all, physicians
are allowed to prescribe morphine and scores of other narcotics to reduce
pain; they, too, can be abused if used improperly. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The measure, authored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos,
D-San Jose, provides a criminal defense for individuals who grow or possess
marijuana for medical purposes when approved in writing by a licensed physician.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The response from Wilson's office was prompt. ``This bill
will be vetoed by the governor,'' said spokesman Jesus Arredondo. ``The
Clinton administration said in August marijuana should not be legalized
for any purpose.'' </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Is this the sorry common ground, where Republican Wilson
and Democrat Clinton can agree to promote their anti-drug policies at the
expense of the painfully sick? </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Here is a clear example of puritanism and politics taking
precedence over sound medical practice and common sense. If medically prescribed
pot provides comfort to terminal patients or relieves the agony of people
in extreme pain -- and many users suffering from disease say it does --
who can fairly deny them their solace? </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>``In a free society, people who are ill shouldn't be made
criminals to alleviate their pain. Wilson is engaging in the politics of
pain,'' said an angry Vasconcellos. Sadly, perhaps the only people who
can not obtain marijuana are housebound patients without an illegal drug
connection and good citizens who would rather bear the pain, discomfort
and nausea of their illnesses rather than violate the law. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Many physicians advise their patients to smoke marijuana,
anyway. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Dr. Lester Grinspoon, of Harvard Medical School, believes
that marijuana will someday be hailed as a safe, inexpensive and versatile
miracle drug. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>In his writings, Grinspoon reports that smoking marijuana
can relieve nausea associated with chemotherapy, prevent blindness induced
by glaucoma, serve as an appetite stimulant for wasting AIDS patients,
act as an anti-epileptic, ward off asthma attacks and migraine headaches,
alleviate chronic pain and reduce the muscle spasms that accompany some
diseases. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Until sanity and humanity prevail in Sacramento and Washington,
law-abiding patients will be denied this drug that might relieve their
suffering. What a pity. </font></p>
