<B>Hydrogen Energy Systems Studies;<br>

<P>

For several years, we have carried out technical and economic 
assessments of 

hydrogen energy systems in support of the development of renewable 
hydrogen as an energy 

carrier.  Our previous research suggests that renewable hydrogen could 
become competitive for 

use in efficient, low-polluting systems (such as fuel cells), beginning 
in the early part of the next 

century.  In assessing alternative pathways for producing and using 
hydrogen, we considered the 

entire energy system.  We estimated the cost and performance of hydrogen 
production systems, 

the cost of delivering hydrogen for various end uses, the cost and 
performance of hydrogen 

end-use equipment, the consumer's life-cycle cost of energy services, 
environmental effects, 

resource constraints, and infrastructure issues.

<P>

Our recent work has focused on three major tasks:  assessing near-term 
options for 

supplying hydrogen transportation fuel from natural gas; assessing the 
feasibility of using the 

existing natural gas infrastructure to supply hydrogen and hydrogen 
blends; and studying fuel 

cells for residential cogeneration applications, a market that might 
have less stringent cost 

requirements than the transportation sector.  In addition, we are 
assessing potential markets for 

hydrogen in Southern California.

<P>

Our results suggest that, even at projected market entry costs of 
$2000/kW, fuel-cell 

systems may be cost effective for cogenerating residential hot water and 
electricity in remote 

locations where access to a power grid is inconvenient or expensive, or 
both.  For other 

locations, fuel-cell cogenerated power will become more attractive as 
system costs are reduced, 

lifetimes are extended, and low-cost hydrogen becomes more available.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>:

<P>One of the key challenges in developing hydrogen as a transportation

fuel is the current lack of infrastructure.  In this study, we

assess various near-term possibilities for producing and delivering

gaseous hydrogen transportation fuel, including (1) hydrogen produced

from natural gas in a large, centralized steam reforming plant,

and truck-delivered as a liquid to refueling stations; (2) hydrogen

produced in a large, centralized steam reforming plant, and delivered

via small-scale hydrogen gas pipeline to refueling stations; (3)

hydrogen produced at the refueling station via small-scale steam

reforming of natural gas; and (4) hydrogen produced via small-scale

electroylsis at the refueling station.

<P>

Small-scale reforming of natural gas could be an important technology

in the early stages of a hydrogen economy.  We assessed the technical

options for low-cost small-scale production of hydrogen from natural

gas, considering (1) steam reforming, (b) partial oxidation, and

(c) autothermal reforming.  Although small-scale steam reformers

are commercially available today, relatively few small units (less

than 1 million scf/day) have been constructed.  Fuel cell manufacturers

are developing advanced designs which are more compact and offer

higher efficiencies for coupling with fuel cells.  Small-scale

partial oxidation systems and autothermal systems are also under

development.  We assessed the cost, performance, and emissions

characteristics of commercially available steam reforming units

and explored the potential for improving performance and reducing

cost.  We also assessed the potential impact of improved reformer

technology on  the delivered cost of hydrogen transportation fuel.

<P>

We are conducting a case study of how hydrogen markets might develop

in Southern California over the next five years.  It is likely

that fleets of hydrogen vehicles will be introduced in California

in the early part of the next century, in response to the zero

emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate.  Other possible uses of hydrogen
energy in this time frame include co-firing and fuel cells.  We

are estimating the size of these potential hydrogen markets. 

This work is being carried out with input from Southern California

Gas Company, the South Coast Air Quality Management District,

and industrial hydrogen suppliers.

<P>

We are also comparing hydrogen to other fuels for fuel cell vehicles,

such as methanol and hydrocarbon fuels derived from crude oil.

 We are interacting with fuel cell manufacturers and with automotive

companies (including Ford, Chrysler, and GM and their subcontractors)

which are considering fuel cell vehicle demonstrations as part

of the DOE/OTT and PNGV programs.  We also interact with groups

at Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories that are studying

fuel cell vehicle systems, as well as other academic groups (UC

Davis, U of Michigan, Georgetown U).  We are evaluating the projected

performance, cost and emissions characteristics of alternative

fuel cell vehicles with (a) compressed gas hydrogen storage; (b)

onboard reforming of methanol; and (c) onboard partial oxidation

of hydrocarbon fuels derived from crude oil.  Although considerable

modeling work has been done on hydrogen and methanol fuel cell

vehicles, there is little published data on vehicles where hydrogen

is produced onboard via partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels

derived from crude oil.  We are concentrating on understanding

the issues for this alternative.

<P>

We are assessing near-term options for producing and delivering 

gaseous hydrogen transportation fuel to users in Southern California.  

We found that a considerable amount of hydrogen would be available

in the LA Basin from existing industrial gas supplies and from

refinery excess hydrogen.  Fleets of perhaps 50,000 to 100,000

fuel cell cards or 1000-2000 PEM fuel cell buses might be fueled

without building new hydrogen production capacity.  Once demand

for hydrogen exceeded this level, on-site production via small-scale

steam reforming or electrolysis would allow the addition of hydrogen

production capacity in small increments, without building a new

hydrogen pipeline system.  In the long term, for large, geographically

concentrated demands, pipeline distribution might ultimately yield

the lowest delivered fuel cost.
