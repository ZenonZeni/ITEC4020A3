SUCCEEDS IN BID TO ACQUIRE BALANCE OF</i></strong></font><font

ANIMAL HEALTH, INC.</i></strong></font></p>
<p><strong>TORONTO AND KANSAS CITY, November 26, 1996 --</strong>
DRAXIS Health Inc. (TSE: DAX; Nasdaq: DRAXF) and Deprenyl Animal
Health, Inc. (TSE: DAH; Nasdaq OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI) jointly
announced today that shareholders of both DRAXIS and Deprenyl
Animal Health, Inc. (&quot;DAHI&quot;) have approved the
acquisition by DRAXIS of all shares of DAHI not already owned by
DRAXIS through a mandatory share exchange. Under the terms of the
mandatory share exchange transaction, DAHI shareholders (other
than DRAXIS and its affiliates) will receive 1.35 DRAXIS common
shares for each DAHI share. The transaction will result in
5,725,188 DRAXIS common shares being issued, bringing the total
outstanding to 29,240,161 shares. </p>
<p>Dr. Martin Barkin, M.D., President and CEO of DRAXIS and
Chairman of DAHI, stated that uniting the two companies will
allow DRAXIS to accelerate DAHI's growth to profitability by
providing additional financial and marketing support. &quot;No
changes will take place in the winning team that brought DAHI to
this point,&quot; he said: &quot;I am confident that this
transaction will free DAHI's management team to focus on what it
has done so well - the development of <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>from
conception to marketplace.&quot; </p>
<p>Dr. David R. Stevens, D.V.M., President and CEO of DAHI, will
continue on as President of DAHI leading the company's further
development of <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>for cognitive dysfunction in
pet dogs, its outlicensing beyond North America, and its
marketing and sales in North America. </p>
<p>Dr. Stevens welcomed the formalization of the support that
DRAXIS had been giving DAHI over the past two years. &quot;DAHI
will now have the necessary resources to assure a successful
launch of <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>in the U.S. and in other countries
where <i>AnipryI&#174; </i>gains regulatory approval,&quot; he
said. DRAXIS, which has been funding the operating requirements
of DAHI over the past two years through periodic issuance of
convertible debt, will provide funds to complete expeditiously
the regulatory approvals of <i>Anipryl&#174;, </i>and to assure a
successful launch of <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>in the U.S. as soon as
regulatory approval is received. </p>
<p>Quotation of DAHI shares on the <i>Nasdaq OTC Bulletin Board </i>will
terminate at the close of trading on November 27, 1996, and DAHI
will be delisted from <em>The</em> <i>Toronto Stock Exchange </i>on
or about December 4, 1996. Shortly, DAHI shareholders will be
receiving instructions by mail on how to exchange their DAHI
share certificates for DRAXIS share certificates. </p>
<p>In connection with the share exchange, Mr. George Darnell, a
director of DAHI since June 13, 1995 has been appointed to the
board of DRAXIS. Mr. Laszlo Kadar, who has served as a DRAXIS
director since June 26, 1990, has resigned as a director of
DRAXIS to make way for the appointment of Mr. Darnell. Mr.
Darnell served as Executive Vice President of Baxter Diagnostics
Inc. from 1991 to his retirement in 1994. Mr. Darnell served as
President of the Baxter Dade Division from 1972 to 1991. Brian
King, Chairman of DRAXIS' board, welcomed Mr. Darnell to the
board of DRAXIS: &quot;George Darnell has had extensive
experience in the health care and pharmaceutical diagnostic
industry in the United States as well as international experience
and is expected to make a strong contribution to the DRAXIS
board.&quot; </p>
<p>DAHI was established in 1991 to develop <i>Anipryl&#174;, </i>a
specific formulation of 1-selegiline, for the treatment of
certain specified disorders of companion animals. DAHI has
developed <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>for the treatment of canine
Cushing's disease, a disorder that affects more than 160,000 pet
dogs in North America alone. DAHI received Canadian regulatory
approval in late 1995 to market <i>AnipryI&#174;</i> in Canada
for canine Cushing's disease. It awaits similar approval from the
U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration. In May 1996 DAHI applied to
the Canadian health authorities for permission to market <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>for
canine cognitive dysfunction, a frequent behavioral deterioration
of geriatric dogs that affects up to 10 times as many dogs in
North America as does canine Cushing's disease and often results
in pet-owners having to euthanize their pet. </p>
<p>DRAXIS Health Inc. is an emerging Toronto-based pharmaceutical
company focused on neurological, dermatological and veterinary
markets in Canada and the United States. Products currently under
development include <i>Modafinil </i>for narcolepsy and
proprietary liposomed topical products for both the prescription
and over-the-counter markets. DRAXIS also operates a U.S.
division offering products for podiatric applications. DAHI, a
wholly owned subsidiary of DRAXIS, has filed for U.S. approval of
its proprietary compound <i>Anipryl&#174; </i>for canine
Cushing's disease. DRAXIS also has a 30% interest in ST&Euml;F
International Corp. (CDN: STEF; NASDAQ Bulletin Board: SEFFF), a
network marketing company specializing in science-based, consumer
health products. </p>
