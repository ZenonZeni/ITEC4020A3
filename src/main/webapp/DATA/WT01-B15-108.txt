As mentioned last month, the junior venture plays are flying, although I did not expect my warning to be careful, to be needed so quickly.<p>The rise and fall of Cartaway Resources should serve us as an example in the risks of speculation. No doubt we have all read the story by now. My interest in this episode is seeing how this action effected Canadian mutual fund prices. I keep daily price charts on about 200 equity funds and all I did was screen them to find which funds took a big hit during the time of the Cartaway debacle. As you might expect, many natural resources funds lost money as Cartaway took its one day drop from $26 to $3. Some growth stock funds were also affected. Of course, while some fund managers paid in the high teens to low twenties for Cartaway, other fund managers bought shares in the two to three dollar range, before the big runup. I was wondering last month why many natural resource funds were doing so well, while the TSE natural resources indices did nothing. It appears that some resource/growth fund managers have been very prescient in grabbing these runaway junior venture situations at relatively low prices.<p>The World seems to be slowly getting the message that Canada is "in play." Investment by foreigners is climbing, partly due to our elected members (bless 'em) getting the Provincial/Federal finances in order. I surveyed my little list of 44 worldwide indices and sub indices using local currency data. Since the Referendum in late October, the top twenty-five percent (11 indices) were mostly Canadian sub indices. Only Mexico, Tokyo and Madrid made it to the top list.<p>My own view is that we <i>should</i> attract international attention if we are approaching the top of the investment cycle. We have a large natural resources base, and commodities/natural resources generally do well at this point in the cycle. Over 40% of our markets are in commodities related companies. Our stock markets should lead the world. In fact, for the first time in years, the TSE 300 has outperformed the Standard and Poor's 500 over the past 12 months. Do not discount a home grown investment. It will be one of your best bets in the coming months. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>25</center></body></html>
