DIVIDED OPPOSITION: THE PAN

As campaigns for the gubernatorial and midterm congressional elections
move into the final stretch, the PRI could hardly be in a better position.
Deep divisions have been reactivated within both major opposition parties
-- the rightist National Action Party (PAN) and the center-left
Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), as their leaders battle over
candidacies and campaign strategy.  The bitter fights waged in party
conventions have exacerbated factionalism and created confusion among
party rank-and-file, while publicly displaying the two top opposition
parties' disorganization and lack of definition.  Needless to say, the PRI
and government publicists have hammered these points across in the print
and electronic media.

While no one expects the opposition to gain ground in this year's
elections, to be held on August 18, the voting outcome will be highly
significant.  First, the PRI sees it as absolutely vital to recover
votes lost in 1988 to verify its historic claim of being "the party
of the 74 majorities." If the PRI can win more than 50% of the vote
cleanly, so much the better.

For their part, the PAN and PRD are locked in a bitter battle to secure
the position of the nation's second strongest electoral force after the
PRI.

In the 1988 elections, the National Democratic Front (the pro-Cardenas,
four-party coalition) overtook the PAN to become the strongest
opposition force, winning 31% of the national vote in the presidential
race, according to official statistics.

The strength of the Front forces (now registered as the PRD) has rankled
the administration ever since, because Cardenas's strong showing in the
official vote count caused Salinas's legitimacy to be questioned when he
took office.  Since the beginning of this year, senior PRI officials have
confidently predicted the demise of the Cardenista PRD party in this
year's elections, asserting that the PRD will only get 15% of the vote.
PRI leaders see similarly dim prospects for the PAN, and they predict
the conservative party will "return to its historic levels" of perhaps 20%
of the vote.

The best chances for significant opposition victories -- numerical or
moral -- lie in the gubernatorial races (see Mexico Service April 10,
1991).  In San Luis Potosi, a broad opposition front, the Coalicion
Democratica, which includes the PAN and PRD and other political and civic
groups, is considered a serious challenger to PRI candidate Fausto Zapata.
(It would hurt the administration little to sacrifice Zapata, who is
identified with the administration of former President Luis Echeverria;
other Echeverria associates --like Colima gubernatorial hopeful Socorro
Diaz -- are being sacrificed as part of the Salinas administration's
message that the liberal wing of the PRI is dead.)

In Guanajuato, PAN candidate Vicente Fox is considered a strong
contender against the PRI's Ramon Aguirre, an unpopular former
Mexico City mayor who has weak ties in the state.  The surprising, last-
minute registration of PRD candidate Porfirio Munoz Ledo (see XI-13),
however, opens up new scenarios.  According to some observers, Munoz
Ledo could come in second after Aguirre.  This would represent a moral
victory for the PRD, particularly because Guanajuato is traditionally a
PAN stronghold, being one of the Catholic bastions dating from the days
of the Cristero war.  Perhaps more importantly, if Fox is relegated to
third place, this sends a devastating message to the PANistas, like Fox,
who oppose negotiating with the PRI government.

In the senatorial races, the only major contest where the opposition has
a strong chance of winning is in Mexico City.  Observers now say the
PAN contender, Vicencio Tovar, could upset PRI challenger Manuel
Aguilera, who is a little-known figure in the mammoth capital.  PRD
challenger, Heberto Castillo, a former presidential candidate for the ex-
socialist party coalition (PMS), is well known and well liked in the
capital and cannot be discounted.

PAN and PRD are expected to win a modest number of Deputyships that
are elected by direct majority vote, particularly in their respective
strongholds of Baja California, Sonora, Yucatan and Chihuahua, and
Michoacan and Guerrero.  The strongest hopes for PAN and PRD are
the "proportional representation" or "plurinominal" contests in which
Deputy seats are apportioned according to the percentage of votes won
by each party in a congressional region (called "circumscription") that
takes in several states.  Proportional representation traditionally favors
opposition parties of all stripes because it grants seats to parties that
won less than a majority vote.  (Indeed, proportional representation was
included in the 1970 political reform as a means of creating spaces for
opposition participation and provides for a more pluralistic, less
hegemonic political system.)

While PAN and PRD might each win dozens of proportional
representation seats, neither party is expected to equal its take in the
1988 races, which gave an unprecedented 110 seats to the PAN and close
to 50 seats to the parties that made up the National Democratic Front.
Most observers predict the real winner at the polls will be what Mexican
wags call "the abstentionism party."  This group of non-voters typically
ranks high in all Mexican elections, and by tradition the congressional
races evoke even less participation than the presidential contest.  In
this, Mexicans correctly identify the presidency as the key office in their
political system.

In this SPECIAL REPORT, MS begins a two-part series focusing on
internal divisions in Mexico's leading opposition parties.  In this issue,
we examine the splits afflicting the PAN.

NATIONAL ACTION PARTY

The PAN regional and national conventions earlier this year underscored
the divisions within the party between the neo-PANistas and the so-called
"traditionalists," or "democratic forum."  In the last decade, and
particularly since 1985, the neo-PANistas have gained power in the
party, and this year they virtually secured control of all key leadership
posts and the overwhelming majority of congressional candidacies.

ASCENDANCY OF NEO-PANISTAS

The neo-PANistas are the businessmen-turned-activists who have pushed
the PAN to take a higher profile and challenge the government more
openly.  As such, they have moved away from the more traditional,
sedate style of a loyal opposition party adopted by the PAN from its
founding in the 1930s through the mid-1970s.  The fiercest advocates of
this position are wealthy northern ranchers who were infuriated -- and
politically motivated -- by former President Echeverria's 1976
confiscation of private ranches in the fertile Yaqui and Mayo valleys of
Sonora state.  Former PAN gubernatorial candidate for Chihuahua,
Francisco Barrios, and PAN President Luis H. Alvarez, a Chihuahua
businessman, exemplify the neo-PANistas.

The neo-PANistas are allied with and inspired by conservative forces,
particularly the far-right civic group, Desarrollo Humano Integral,
Asociacion Civil.  Today, the PAN has largely abandoned its traditional
role of crying out against fraud, corruption and mismanagement in the
PRI government in favor of a new tune.  Since President Salinas came
to power, he has preempted the PAN's program by deepening the
economic liberalization program, hinting at an end to the agrarian reform
lands (ejidos) and has begun courting the Roman Catholic church,
allowing it greater latitude in society.  In this context, the neo-PANistas
have been the first in Mexico's oldest opposition party to cooperate with
the PRI by holding regular meetings and negotiations with Salinas.

Their strategy of alliance with the government is based on a congruence
of ideology with Salinas and the fact that the PAN secured an
unprecedented 106 Chamber of Deputy seats (of 500 total) in 1988,
giving the party the swing vote on issues such as constitutional reforms
that require a two-thirds majority.  Concomitantly, the PRI gained only
a 10-seat majority (with 260 seats), and was compelled to forge an
alliance with PAN in order to pass constitutional reforms.

Seeking to capitalize on their newfound strength, the neo-PANistas
eagerly entered into talks with the government aimed at influencing
policy.  Early on, Salinas scored an important victory by gaining PAN
support for the constitutional reform that revised the electoral code and
set the new rules that will govern the 1991 races.  Support for the
electoral reform is the single best example of how much the newly
ascendant ideologues of the PAN are willing to compromise with the
government.  The electoral reform vote took place just three weeks after
former PAN presidential candidate Manuel Clouthier died in a car
accident.  Clouthier was an adamant opponent of such collaboration and
specifically opposed voting with the PRI to pass the electoral reform.

Neo-PANistas justify this action by saying that they demanded and got
government compliance to formulate a new and clean voter registration
roll. In exchange, however, the PAN voted for electoral rules that
limit or close off opportunities for opposition representation in the
legislature.  These are the "governability clause," which provides that
the party winning 35% of the vote will automatically be awarded 50% plus
1 of the Chamber of Deputy seats, and a prohibition on the formation of
electoral coalitions.  Most analysts believe the governability clause
favors the PRI because no opposition party has ever been awarded more
than 31% of the count in official election results; they say the PRI
would not have supported the measure if it would harm its own interests.
Also, the electoral reform bans the formation of coalitions, such as the
four-party National Democratic Front, which backed Cardenas and nearly
toppled the PRI in 1988.

In exchange for collaborating on the electoral reform, the PAN has
reaped rewards on several fronts.  First, it has gained unprecedented
electoral victories, most notably the governorship of Baja California.
Central government collusion in the PAN win is suggested by the fact
that PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio went on national television to
announce the victory of PAN's Ernesto Ruffo at the same time that PRI
leaders in Baja California were still debating the outcome.  Building on
its newfound strength in the legislature, the party has become an
influential mediator of government policy.

The association with the ruling group has also bolstered the party's
treasury -- a direct outcome of the ascendancy of the neo-PANistas, who
overturned the 50-year policy of refusing to accept money from the
government.  The PAN now receives financial support assigned it by the
Interior Ministry in proportion to the number of votes won by the party
in national elections.

It is doubtful that the PAN-PRI alliance will become a permanent feature
of Mexico's political landscape, even though it has served Salinas's
interests well.  The informal association became mutually beneficial in
1989 when a shaken PRI, commanding a slim 10-vote majority in the
Chamber of Deputies, was obliged to seek cooperation to gain passage
of constitutional reforms.  In a formal sense, the alliance has fallen into
disuse ever since the October 1989 electoral reform.  Since then, Salinas
has not advanced a single legislative initiative that would require a two-
thirds majority.  Additional constitutional reforms are probably being
held back until after the new Congress is seated, with the PRI expecting
that more than two thirds of the seats will be occupied by loyal PRIistas.
As a result, the August mid-term congressional elections could severely
curtail the PAN's newfound power.

DISSIDENTS OR FORISTAS

The rise of the neo-PANistas has been countered by a faction that
defends the traditional PAN stance as an uncompromising opposition
party that cuts no deals with the government.  The fissure widened
during the debate about allying with the PRI to approve the electoral
reform.  The PANistas who opposed that alliance have formed a group
called the Foro Doctrinario y Democratico.

The Foristas oppose negotiations with the government and are pressing
for greater rank-and-file participation in party conventions and selection
of party nominees, and in the political system as a whole.  On the issue
of electoral fraud, the Foristas follow the lead of Clouthier, who staged
hunger strikes to protest fraud and steadfastly refused to negotiate with
the PRI government any compromise regarding electoral procedures and
outcomes.  In this, they are similar to the so-called "intransigent"
faction in the PRD, which is identified with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
adamantly refuses to meet with President Salinas for private talks,
demanding instead that talks with the government be conditioned on the
prior setting of an agenda.

Indeed, two prominent Foristas have joined the "National Accord for
Democracy," a pluralistic group launched by Cardenas that calls for
clean elections and negotiations to set the terms of a peaceful transition
to democracy.  For the coming August elections, the Foristas call for no
talks between the national PAN leadership and the government that could
decide outside the ballot "on the outcome of congressional and
gubernatorial races."

Foristas have occupied important leadership posts in the party in recent
years, from which they have been able to confront directly the neo-
PANistas.  Mexico City PAN President Jose Angel Conchello and Nuevo
Leon PAN leader (and former presidential candidate) Pablo Emilio
Madero are Foristas who have led head-on confrontations with
ideological opponents in the party.  Other leading figures of the dissident
group include former party Secretary-General Jesus Gonzalez Schmal,
Deputy Bernardo Batiz, former Federal Election Committee delegate
Juan de Dios Castro and Mexico City Assemblyman and former PAN
press spokesman Gonzalo Altamirano.

Guanajuato gubernatorial candidate Vicente Fox is also a Forista.  Fox
is an important figure in PAN because the party generally lacks strong
candidates for senior elective offices.  Fox is considered a serious
contender for that governorship, thanks to his personal dynamism, his
repeated stumping of Guanajuato state and the flatness of PRI candidate
Ramon Aguirre and internal PRI squabbles.  However, Fox's
identification with the Forista cause worries the party's national leaders
who, it is said, are willing to sacrifice him order to cement the neo-
PANistas' stranglehold on the party.

Foristas who campaigned to run as PAN candidates for Congress were
blocked in their bid for nomination at both the national and Mexico City
PAN conventions.  At the national convention, the National Executive
Committee vetoed the candidacy of Jesus Gonzalez Schmal, a former
Deputy, as a Mexico City Assemblyman.  Gonzalez Schmal had won
68% of the convention's vote for his nomination.  Forista Jose Angel
Conchello opted to withdraw from the competition for proportional
representation slots after he was excluded from the party's list of pre-
candidates.  At the Mexico City convention, rivalries between the two
factions were opened wide when neither Abel Vicencio Tovar, a neo-
PANista, nor Forista Bernardo Batiz captured the necessary 66% of the
vote for securing the nomination.  In two rounds of voting, Batiz won
52% against 48% for Tovar.  However, Tovar came out the nominee
when the issue was put to a vote by the National Executive Committee
which defeated Batiz, 13 to 3.  Batiz blames his defeat on his activism
as a Forista.

The rough handling of Foristas has precipitated a predictable airing of
the party's dirty linen in public.  Gonzalez Schmal has publicly protested
the veto of his candidacy (which the party's senior leaders refuse to
confirm), claiming that he was given no reasons for the rebuff.  In early
June, Batiz announced his resignation from his post as vice-coordinator
of the PAN delegation in the Chamber of Deputies.  His resignation
came after Tovar, PAN's congressional coordinator named two non-
Foristas as vice-coordinators to take over his responsibilities while he
campaigned for the Senate.  At the same time, a letter circulated among
PAN Congressmen calling for the resignation of Batiz from the
coordinator post.  Batiz has launched barbs at the party, saying it is
running for the distinction of being the "second official party" after the
PRI.

CONCLUSION

Facing the upcoming elections, PAN's national leadership is in a hopeful
mood.  Party President Alvarez confidently predicts the PAN will take
five governorships: Vicente Fox in Guanajuato; Rogelio Sada Zambrano,
in Nuevo Leon (see POLITICS); coalition contender Salvador Nava in
San Luis Potosi; Moises Canale, in Sonora; and Arturo Nava Bolanos in
Queretaro.  In addition, party leaders believe that PAN candidates will
win 74 direct majority deputyships (primarily in Baja California,
Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon, San Luis
Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora and Yucatan).

However, most political observers expect the PAN will win only one
governorship outright -- perhaps Guanajuato -- and, at most, a second
statehouse in coalition with the PRD in San Luis Potosi.  And taking
even 74 deputyships would still leave the PAN delegation diminished in
comparison with its showing in 1988.

This year's races are likely to be even tougher for the opposition than
1988.  The PRI campaigns are more intense, as the ruling party is
forewarned this time about popular discontent, and is taking steps
through populist spending programs to woo voters.  The divisions within
the PAN can only debilitate the party on the eve of elections that are
likely to bring setbacks for the conservative party.

BANAMEX PUT UP FOR BID

With Banamex formally put on the block on July 2, the bank
privatization goes into full swing.  In a press conference on July 4,
Finance Undersecretary Guillermo Ortiz, in charge of bank
privatizations, announced that all these privatizations should be
completed in the first half of 1992.

The government will sell off its 70.7% holding in Banamex, the largest
and most profitable in Mexico, in several tranches.  The sale conditions
differ from those of the other banks so far offered, owing to Banamex's
size and relative importance.  Some 31% of its shares will be offered
through an auction mechanism; another 20% will be offered to directors
who form part of regional boards and already have expressed an interest
in participating.  The winning bidder will have the right to the shares not
taken up by the regional directors.  The remaining 20% may also be
purchased by the winning bidder in order to attain the 51% necessary for
overall voting control -- although it is likely that most of this will be
placed, subsequent to the award of the controlling stake, with foreign
investors.

Payment terms for the auctioned shares are: a deposit (in Cetes) of
Mex$150 billion (US$50 million) prior to the auction on August 23; 20%
of the bid price to be paid five days after the award; and four other equal
installments at 30 day intervals after that date.  Bids are due to be
awarded by September 6.

Banamex currently has a market capitalization of approximately Mex$12
trillion (US$4 billion), implying that 20% would cost US$800 million.
With a net worth of US$1.8 billion, this implies a current ratio of price
to net worth of 2.2 times: should the bank go for 2.5 times net worth,
as is expected, this would represent an overall value of US$4.5 billion.
The bank's Mex$78 trillion (US$25 billion) in total assets represents
25% of the Mexican banking system, and its profits for the first five
months of 1991 were Mex$512 billion (US$170 million).  With
annualized profits of approximately US$400 million, this would put
Banamex's prospective P/E at current market levels at 10 times earnings.

Key bidders for Banamex are likely to be Roberto Hernandez and the
Accival brokerage; Manuel Senderos and the Grupo Desc (to whom we
understand that Alberto Bailleres, a major industrialist, has allied
himself); and the Visa group, headed by Eugenio Garza Laguera (which
already has all elements of a financial group, except a bank, through
Grupo Vamsa, and formerly owned Banca Serfin).  Hernandez, who was
the underbidder in the Telmex auction, is currently the favorite for
Banamex.  However, Desc has a good chance.  The Visa group is
considered to be more interested in recovering its former bank, Serfin.

SWELLING CONTINGENCY FUND

Guillermo Ortiz also stated that the Contingency Fund, formed as a kind
of reserve to protect Mexico against oil price fluctuations has already
amassed US$4.5 billion.  Funds have come from the Telmex
privatization (both the controlling stake and L shares), which have
brought in approximately US$4 billion, and some of the proceeds
(estimated by the government at US$632 million) from the three banks
already sold off (Multibanco, Banpais, Cremi).  With only half the year
gone, the government has practically achieved its US$5 billion
privatization target for this year.

PEMEX ISSUES ECU BOND

In the first such bond issued by a Latin American borrower, Pemex
placed an ECU100 million bond in the Eurobond market, according to
a July 5 announcement.  The bonds have a term of 3 years, a coupon of
11.5%, and were priced at 100.05, giving a yield of 11.48%, equivalent
to 9.68% in dollars.  The lead manager was Paribas, with co-managers
Swiss Bank, Bear Stearns, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Bankers' Trust,
Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch.

This latest bond issue follows a total of US$650 million raised through
seven issues by Pemex, Nafin and Bancomext in 1990.  The coupon is
the lowest yet achieved by a Mexican state borrower.  It represents the
beginning of a second financing stage for Pemex.  In the first, the state
oil company sought to reestablish its image as a borrower in international
markets (after the 1982 debacle): the second stage is intended to fund its
expansion program.  Pemex plans to raise US$500 million annually over
the next four years, which would cover at least 10% of its investment
program during that period.

The "voluntary" return by Mexican borrowers to the international market
is considered by the Mexican government as a sign that the debt crisis is
over.  The key change from 1978-1982 borrowing patterns is that, so
far, all Mexican financings have been made through bond and equity
markets.  This approach offers marketable instruments and spreads the
risk over a broad range of investors.  The earlier practice of direct bank
borrowing, which concentrated the risk, led directly to the 1982 crisis.

FREE PESO FUTURES

The market for exchange rate cover (coberturas cambiarias) was extended
to the free rate on July 1.  The new system has several limiting features:

* Participants must be corporations in the private sector.

* Settlement, although denominated in dollars, will only be in pesos.

* Terms are between 72 hours and 365 days.

* Rates will be set with reference to free rates fixed for Tesobonos
(government short-term loan instruments denominated at the free rate).

As of July 5, quotations for exchange rate cover at the free rate were
exactly the same as those for the controlled rate.

The introduction of this market could lead to two positive outcomes over
the medium term for Mexico: unification of the free and controlled rate,
and introduction of a more orthodox peso-dollar futures (or forward)
market in Mexico.  This development, as well as the return to the
international marketplace (see previous item) would mark the final stages
of rehabilitation of the Mexican economy following the 1982 crash.

COMERCIAL MEXICANA DEAL

Comercial Mexicana, one of three major Mexican supermarket chains
(along with Cifra and Gigante), has associated with Price Club of the US
in a 51-49% joint venture.  They plan to set up 12 stores, beginning in
December, the first one to be located in the heavily populated middle
class suburb of Satelite in Mexico City. Comercial Mexicana, which
owns 75 stores throughout Mexico, went public earlier in 1991 on the
Mexican Stock Exchange.  Price Club operates 59 stores (51 in the US
and 8 in Canada) on a wholesaling formula.  The initial plan for the
Mexican venture is to supply US-made products, but the new stores will
be gradually moving towards stocking Mexican merchandise.  Price Club
already supplies several of Comercial's competitors in Mexico, and it is
rumored that they have stopped these purchases since hearing of its
linkup with Comercial. Gigante, the other main supermarket chain, is
likely list its shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange in July.  It intends
to make an up to US$200 million share offering through Inverlat (in
Mexico) and an international underwriting group led by Bear Stearns.

KOREAN AUTO INVESTMENT

Kia Motors, Korea's third largest auto manufacturer, announced on June
26 that it plans to invest up to US$2 billion in an auto assembly plant in
the state of Tamaulipas or Sonora.  Other major Korean chaebols
(groups) that already have investments in Mexico include Daewoo
(televisions), Hyundai (containers and trailers), Goldstar and Samsung
(both electronics).  Korean companies are clearly intent on imitating
Japan in using Mexico as a platform for entry into NAFTA.

PEASE LETTER ON FORD LABOR PRACTICES

US Congressman Don Pease (D-Ohio) is preparing a letter to President
Carlos Salinas questioning the handling of a recent labor dispute at the
Ford plant in Mexico City.  Pease is a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee, the key committee with oversight over the free trade
negotiations.  His inquiry into Mexican labor practices, as reported by
the official news agency Notimex, could set a precedent for ongoing US
congressional questioning of the Mexican government for the duration of
the FTA talks.

The letter will express the congressman's concern about the dispute over
which labor confederation is to represent Ford employees.  Copies of the
Pease letter will be sent to the US Trade Representative, senior officers
of the Ford Motor Company and the United Automotive Workers union.

The Pease inquiry stems from a year-long dispute over whether the Ford
workers would be represented by the PRI-affiliated Confederacion de
Trabajadores Mexicanos (CTM) or by the less official Confederacion
Obrera Revolucionaria (COR).  Earlier this year, the CTM allegedly won
the majority of workers' votes to renew its control of the union.
However, COR-affiliated workers, who claim to have the allegiance of
55% of the 3,000-plus members, demanded a recount. Official results in
the June 3 reballoting gave a slim majority to the CTM -- with 1,325
votes against 1,112 for the COR.  That narrow margin has raised
questions in many quarters.  PRD congressmen denounced the recount
in advance, revealing that Labor Minister Arsenio Farell had intervened
to favor the CTM.  They disclosed a letter signed by Farell in which he
requested Trade Minister Jaime Serra Puche's "intervention to make
Ford see the grave consequences it would bring to lose."  Several days
before the new balloting, Senator Paul David Wellstone (D-Min.)
expressed his concern about the fairness of the recount procedure in a
letter addressed to Mexican Ambassador to the US, Gustavo Petricioli.
"From my point of view, the letter [of Farell] puts in serious doubt the
impartiality and fairness of the preparation of the election for
representation of the Ford plant.  I am very worried that underground
intimidation, such as open violence, not be repeated in this conflict," the
Senator wrote, alluding to attacks by shock groups on the union picket
lines on Jan. 8, 1990 that ended in the death of one worker, Cleto
Nigmo Urbina.  On the day of the recount, workers had to make their
way through police lines manned by traffic cops, anti-riot squads,
highway police and judicial police and Interior Ministry agents to cast
their ballots while helicopters flew overhead.

Following the alleged CTM victory in the recount, workers supporting
COR were threatened with loss of their jobs.  The CTM has demanded
that COR backers who want to continue working at the Ford plant must
sign a letter which says: "...due to confusion or lack of thought, I
expressed my vote (in the June 3 recount) in favor of the COR, however,
in reasoned reflection I have reached the consideration of accepting fully
my union discipline as much for the organization I belong to...as for the
CTM, which has always been characterized by its defense of workers."
As the free trade talks progress, more US Senators and Congressmen
with close ties to the US labor movement are sure to scrutinize Mexican
labor practices very closely.

NUEVO LEON ELECTIONS

The leadoff contest in the gubernatorial stakes, in Nuevo Leon, offers a
preview of what to expect from the August 18 contests in the other
states, hints at upcoming administration policy, and puts to the test
government promises that electoral procedures will be cleaned up (MS
XI-13).  The outcome shows that charges of electoral irregularities are
unlikely to be put to rest this year.

As expected (XI-8), PRI candidate Socrates Rizzo held a strong lead over
PAN and PRD challengers in preliminary returns from the July 7 Nuevo
Leon state gubernatorial elections.  With more than 60% of the vote
counted, Rizzo had won 62% of the ballots, against 38% for PAN
challenger Rogelio Sada and 3% for PRD contender Lucas de la Garza.
According to official statistics, more than 50% of eligible voters cast
their ballots.  This is a high voter turnout for Mexico where abstention
rates of 65% or more are common in state elections.  Early returns had
no information on the outcome of the vote for 26 state congressional
seats.  The turnout for all parties other than the three leading contenders
was abysmal: 0.2% each for the Partido Popular Socialista and the
Partido del Frente Cardenista de Reconstruccion Nacional, both satellite
parties controlled by the PRI; 0.1% for the Partido Autentico de la
Revolucion Mexicana, another PRI satellite; less than 0.2% for the
conservative Partido Democrata Mexicana and the locally based Partido
Liberal Revolucionario.

The Nuevo Leon campaign was significant in that it was the first real
three-way race for governor in country's history.  Each of the candidates
of the three leading parties -- PRI, PAN and PRD -- is a prominent
figure, has roots in the state, and commands a strong base of support.
In a sense, Rizzo was the least locally based of the leading challengers.
He was launched as candidate for Monterrey mayor in 1988 by then-
Programming and Budget Minister Carlos Salinas de Gortari.  Once in
the mayorship, and bolstered by official backing from the central
government, he was able to preempt the governor in many functions, and
succeeded in completing public works programs that gained him
popularity. Rogelio Sada is a prominent business leader descended from
the founding families of the Monterrey industrial establishment.  He was
CEO of the glass giant, Vitro, until six years ago when the firm ran him
out for participating openly in PAN party politics.  He enjoys a strong
following among the PAN's traditional constituency, the conservative,
pro-business upper class and the middle classes.

Lucas de la Garza, PRD candidate, is the son of a popular former
governor.  A cattle rancher, de la Garza served the previous governor
for five years as planning director and was the top cabinet official
(Secretario de Gobierno) for the sitting governor, Jorge Trevino, until he
resigned to protest corruption in government.  De la Garza's natural
constituency is in the state's rural areas, but his charisma, home-style
campaigning and reputation for honesty have gained him support in
Monterrey as well. Rizzo's closeness to President Salinas lend a special
note of significance to the governor-elect's pronouncements, which can
be interpreted as a signal of the policy thrust the Salinas administration
has in mind for the remaining half of the sexenio.  At the July 2
ceremony closing his campaign, Rizzo proposed a Pacto Nuevo Leon
which, he said, would improve the standard of living in the state.  The
seven points of the Pacto are:

* Internationalization of Nuevo Leon: make the state into a beachhead of
economic modernization in preparation for the FTA;

* Decentralization and regional development;

* Growth with order: improve urban transportation, emphasizing electric
transport;

* Improve the quality of life: substitution of fuel oil with natural gas in
industry and promote supply of ecological fuels;

* Safety and justice: create an office to defend citizens, set up a Human
Rights Commission and a special appeals office to improve the
administration of justice;

* Modernization of finances and public administration: renegotiate the
state debt, extending the repayment period and improving the interest
rates;

* Democratic Solidarity: "implement democracy as a form of life that is
not reduced to political and electoral aspects, end arrogance and
arbitrariness of public officials."

On a symbolic level, the close of the Rizzo campaign also sent some
clear messages.  The ceremony, attended by 9,000 PRIistas, was held in
Cintermex.  This is the new international trade center built by the major
Monterrey enterprises on land donated by the government to serve as a
convention center and to house permanent exhibits of Monterrey industry
products, including ordering and shipping facilities.  Rizzo took
advantage of the setting to leave behind his former life as an activist in
an ultra-left group related to the Spartacus League.  Seeking to touch all
the right buttons for his audience, Rizzo embraced the conservative
Monterrey values, saying, "I believe in the family as the essential pillar
of society.  I believe in the enterprising spirit, in the strength and
values of the work ethic that have created the Nuevo Leon of today."  In a
highly unusual statement for a PRIista, Rizzo overlooked the formal
separation of church and politics and said, "I believe in God above all
things."

The Nuevo Leon gubernatorial and state congressional contest also
marked the debut of the new federal voter registration list and voter
credentials.  It thus provides early warning of problems that may be
expected to plague the six gubernatorial and nationwide congressional
races on August 18.  Opposition parties of all stripes reported
irregularities that would permit fraud or prevent eligible voters from
casting a ballot.  Political parties received the voter registration list
later than scheduled, allowing them minimum time to correct errors on the
padron.  PRD militants detected names that appeared three and four
times on the voter registration list. In addition, the list of designated
opposition party observers scrambled the names of poll-watchers and
their respective districts, forcing opposition parties to work quickly to
correct these errors.

The Federal Electoral Institute delegate for Nuevo Leon, Roberto
Villarreal Roel, reported July 5 that more than 228,000 voter credentials
had not been distributed, meaning that 15% of the state's 1,564,972
voters were effectively disqualified.  Two days before the election, PRD
candidate Lucas de la Garza charged the PRI was organizing shock
groups to intimidate voters and "carrousel" operations to transport PRI
supporters to different voting booths to vote several times.  De la Garza,
saying he had received information from high-ranking state PRI sources,
claimed that the PRI had already decided how many votes it would
obtain in various districts.

PAN and PRD had arranged to run a joint operation on election day to
detect and report election fraud and to compare voting results.  The two
parties agreed to "share" poll-watchers, with PRD militants covering the
polls in rural areas and PAN in charge of the greater Monterrey polling
booths. The two parties will cross and compare information gathered by
their poll-watchers about the vote counts at each precinct.  The election
was to be watched by at least 150 observers gathered by the Asamblea
Democratica por el Sufragio Efectivo (ADESE), a national, pluralistic
group formed by representatives of opposition parties, human rights
groups and civic associations.

Nevertheless, the elections themselves were marred by a series of
irregularities.  PAN candidate Sada Zambrano alleged that the ballots had
not been appropriately signed by electoral officials at the state capital.
There was a heavy voter turnout in two large townships governed by
PAN mayors, but insufficient ballots available at voting booths: the State
Electoral Commission sent only 200 ballots to precincts that had
registered 1,000 voters.  Throughout the day, "carrousels," traditionally
operated by the PRI, were reported to be carrying voters to different
locations to vote several times.  Poll-watchers from the PAN and PRD
parties were expelled from several precincts.  In districts that are
opposition strongholds, voters were allowed to vote without credentials,
a move alleged to favor the PRI.  One person was arrested for stealing
a ballot box and another charged with trying to organize a carrousel.

Other serious irregularities reported in rural areas included no ballots
sent to the rural town of Montemorelos, and in the towns of Mier y
Noruega and Dr. Arroyo, the location of voting booths was scrambled
so that citizens did not know where to cast their ballots.  By the close of
election day, the PRD issued a list of 69 irregularities - although it is
not clear how much difference they would have made, while Lucas de la
Garza, the PRD candidate, said it was too early to make a judgement
about them.

ELECTION DEBATE INTENSIFIES

This experience will only intensify the growing controversy over
electoral procedures and the government's intention of democratizing
Mexican political life.  The PRD delegation in the Chamber of Deputies
proposed on July 3 that the August 18 elections be postponed until
September 22.  The purpose would be to allow enough time to hand out
credentials to all eligible registered voters and to provide political
parties with the voter registration list enough in advance of the elections to
allow for corrections to be made.  The proposal is to be debated in the
Chamber beginning July 8.  As the preparations for the Nuevo Leon
election demonstrate, the government has been unable to meet either of
its self-imposed deadlines for handing out the voter registration lists or
distributing voter credentials to all eligible voters.

Questions about the government's intentions are being raised anew
because of recent statements made by President Salinas that indicate that
economic reform takes a higher priority that political reform.  During his
trip to Europe (see below), President Salinas stated that democracy
cannot become strong nor justify itself in the absence of appropriate
economic conditions. "For that [reason] stability has a high priority,
because without it the reforms of the productive apparatus, expectations
and even the social spirit (could) be placed at risk," Salinas told Czech
President Vaclav Havel.  Also in Europe, Salinas reiterated his
administration's refusal to admit international observers to elections.

These comments sparked a sharp response from PAN President Luis H.
Alvarez.  Speaking in Monterrey, at the close of the PAN  gubernatorial
camapaign, Alvarez said, "We will insist that in Mexico economic
measures cannot be successful if they are not matched by an opening in
the political sphere.  A common effort between people and government
is needed to face the challenges, and this can only take place in a
democratic setting."  Those thoughts were echoed by the director of the
Manufacturers' Chamber of Nuevo Leon, Mariano Montero Zubillaga,
who commented that "We see some advances in political matters,
although the ideal would be for those advances to be more rapid in order
to match the economic opening."

SALINAS TOUR OF EUROPE

The primary goal of President Salinas's early July swing through Europe
was to seek foreign investment, particularly in Germany and Italy.  The
purpose of the visits to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, according
to sources close to the president, is to observe first hand the
transformation of those societies.

In Germany, Salinas met with the presidents of Volkswagen and
Mercedes Benz.  Both automotive giants announced new investments:
US$900 million to expand the VW plant in Puebla, and DM27 million
for Mercedes Benz, which will begin producing light trucks in Mexico.
In Germany, the two governments signed an agreement establishing a
mechanism for holding bilateral talks to strengthen cooperation, and
another arranging joint financing, with a German loan and Banobras
credits, for construction of a second light train line in Guadalajara.  At
the conclusion of the German tour, Trade Secretary Jaime Serra
announced that more than 60 German firms have pledged to invest about
US$3 billion in Mexico over the next few years.

During his brief visit in Czechoslovakia, Salinas met with President
Vaclav Havel, and called for a European dialogue with Latin America.
Reflecting on the contradictory forces of Balkanization that is breaking
up European republics and globalization of national economies, Salinas
averred that foreign financing and opening of trade opportunities are the
necessary ingredients to bolster incipient democracies.  In this regard,
Mexico sees the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the
GATT as critical, the president said.

In his meeting with Salinas, Soviet President Gorbachev expressed his
interest in deepening ties with Latin America and Mexico.  The two men
discussed the free trade agreement, Cuba and the July 18-19
Iberoamerican Summit to be held in Guadalajara.  Cuban President Fidel
Castro is to attend, which could lead to policy decisions about relations
in the hemisphere with the Castro regime.  In a press conference,
Gorbachev announced that he will make a state visit to Mexico next year.
The presidents signed agreements that provide for Pemex to offer
technical assistance in reconstruction of an oil refinery, setting up a
direct telephone line between the two countries, and establishing joint
cooperation in combatting drug trafficking.

Salinas also held talks with Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian
Federation, and former Foreign Relations Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze, who resigned from the Communist Party hours after his
meeting with the Mexican president.

Salinas was accompanied on his trip by leading Mexican businessmen
including Carlos Slim, owner of Telmex, Claudio X. Gonzalez, director
of Kimberly Clark and presidential adviser on foreign investment, and
Roberto Hernandez, head of the Accival brokerage.

EXCHANGE AND METALS

The exchange rate continued to devalue by 40 centavos/day.  During the
period, exchange cover for the free rate was introduced (see FINANCE),
on the same lines as that for the controlled rate.  There was no difference
in quotes between free and controlled rate cover.  This could be the
prelude to an eventual unification of rates, but the government seems in
no hurry.

INTEREST RATES

Rates for 28-day Cetes backed up for two successive weeks, with 91-day
paper rising in sympathy, as the government mopped up liquidity with
larger Cete issues.  With projected real rates close to 6%, we consider
it unlikely rates will rise much further.

STOCK MARKET

The stock market index advanced by 3% over the period, although it is
still just off its June 6 high of 1,131.  The period began with a fall of
28
points (to 1,052) in sympathy with the Dow, itself influenced by the
Nikkei, which had plunged on the Nomura revelations.  It was choppy
for the rest of the week, closing on June 28 (the end of the month and
the semester) at 1,058.

Influenced by the Dow, the market showed a strong upswing at the
beginning of the second week, with rises of 19, 18, 2 and 23 points on
the first four days of trading, before profit taking on July 5 pushed it
back down to 1,114 at the end of the period. An analysis of the market
for the second quarter and the first semester is provided in this week's
SPOTLIGHT.  In it, we continue to recommend 30% in stocks in:
Cemex, Cifra, Codumex, Kimberly, Telmex and Ttolmex.

There is no change in the overall MS portfolio recommendation:
positions of 10% in Adjustabonos, 25% in Tesobonos, 30% in stocks,
30% in money market instruments and 5% in BIBs.

MEXICAN STOCK MARKET: FIRST SEMESTER 1991

Favorable developments on the financial and privatization fronts have
lifted stock prices beyond the highs achieved in the previous quarter, and
the market still has plenty of momentum.  The Bolsa index shot ahead
by 32% from April through June (up from 28% in the first quarter),
cresting at a record 1,131 on June 6.  For the semester, the gain was
68% in peso terms and 65% in dollars (see Table 1B in printed copy of
newsletter).

In this regular quarterly MS analysis of the Bolsa, we look at the
market's performance in the second quarter (see Mexico Service, April 10,
1991 for first quarter results) and the first half of 1991, breaking down
the surveyby sector and individual companies.  Then we consider the factors
moving the market, prospects for the remainder of 1991, and offer our
stock portfolio recommendations.

SECOND QUARTER TRENDS

The market had closed the previous quarter at a record 803 points.
(Note that the final three zeroes were removed from the index on May
13; for purposes of this analysis, we have dropped these three digits for
earlier figures retroactively).  That spurt was followed by four distinct
phases in the market's behavior in the second quarter, with alternating
periods of advances and consolidations.

April 1-17: Scaling new heights

By the end of the first week of April, the market had risen to 859 and
continued on its upward course in the second week, reaching a new peak
of 934 on April 17.  Fueling the drive were the bull market in the US,
where the Dow broke 3,000 on April 17; generally favorable reviews of
Salinas's April visit to the US and Canada to promote the FTA; and
market anticipation of a successful selloff of the government's Telmex
L shares, which boosted the Telmex stock quotation.

April 18-May 6: Consolidation

Following the explosive advances in the first half of April, the market
took a breather, mainly on technical grounds, through the beginning of
May.  It had doubled back to 919 on May 6.

May 7-June 6: Further advances

The following period saw the Bolsa breaking a succession of records,
propelled by two important developments.  One was the success of the
Telmex issue as priced on May 13, reinforced by positive news for the
FTA as two key US congressional committees rejected resolutions
blocking extension of the fast-track on May 14, and as other obstacles
were cleared away thereafter.  The index leaped from 931 on May 7 to
993 on May 9, and attained a new closing high of 1,008 on May 13
(without the index adjustment that day, it would have broken through the
one million barrier).  By May 17, it had soared to 1,018.  The index was
further spurred the following week by positive fast-track votes in the
House on May 23, putting it up to 1,045, and the Senate on May 24;  by
May 31,  it had reached 1,096.  The market crested on June 6 at an all-
time peak of 1,131 (80% above its level at end-1990).

June 7-28: Second Retracement

Following May's extraordinary performance, the market went through
a period of consolidation in June, dropping back to 1,080 by June 21.
The main influences during this period were the announcement of the
first three bank sales at higher prices than expected, which caused
switching on the margin between nonbank and bank stocks by some
Mexican investors.  A slight backup in interest rates also took its toll,
as did profit-taking to cash in on the gains of the previous month.  Even so,
the market closed the semester on June 28 at 1,058, only 6% off its all-
time high.  This meant a 68% advance in pesos and 65% in dollars over
the end-1990 level.

SECTORAL PERFORMANCE

SECOND QUARTER

Against the average (index) increase of 32%, eight sectors came in above
average and twelve below (see Table 2 in printed copy of newsletter).
Only three sectors failed to keep pace with the 3% estimated CPI increase
for the quarter. The top eight groups were as follows: Banks, Construction,
Insurance, Clothing, Brokerage, Food, Groups and Tobacco.  Financial
concerns (banks, insurance, brokerage) dominated the lineup owing to
euphoria over the bank privatization and the potential synergies from the
formation of financial groups.  The Construction sector was spurred on by
continued strong performances by the cement companies (Cemex, Ttolmex).
Food was boosted by good results for Bimbo, and Groups by the big hikes in
the shares of Contal and Visa, whose main holding is Femsa.
Metallurgy, Electricals and Engineering, at the other end of the scale,
did not even beat inflation.  The primary cause of this weak performance
is the unmarketable nature of the stocks in the Metallurgy and
Engineering sectors.  In the Electrical sector, share prices of telecoms
suppliers (Ericsson, Indetel) also failed to lift off due to investor
concerns that Telmex, under new ownership and management, would
squeeze their margins.  Codumex also showed little positive movement.

Several high capitalization, marketable sectors are clustered in the area
above inflation, but below the average.  In the Utilities sector, Telmex -
- with the dominant weighting -- turned in a moderate 26%.  In Steel,
Tamsa's 24% increase also held down the overall sectoral results.
Exporting sectors (Chemicals and Mining) continued to do relatively
poorly, pending confirmation of a US recovery.  Paper and Stores stocks
adjusted downward after relatively strong performances in the previous
two quarters.

FIRST SEMESTER

For the first half of the year (see Table 3 in print copy of newsletter),
there are just five sectors that beat the index increase of 68%, with 15
sectors underperforming.  Only three sectors did worse than inflation,
estimated at 9% for the period. The big advance in Construction stocks
reflected a major catchup by Cemex and Ttolmex, which had underperformed
the market during the two previous years.  The surge in bank stocks is
attributable to movement on  the  privatization  front;  when  the  first
three banks were sold at multiples of price/book at least 50% higher than
had been expected, the sector was revalued overall.  The strength showed by
Groups reflected advances in Contal, Visa and Desc.  A major runup in
Telmex prices prior to the latest phase of its privatization underpinned
the move in Utilities.  Steel's good showing was accounted for by
advances in both Tamsa and Sidek (which still has about half its assets
in Steel, with the rest in tourism).

At the bottom of the ranking, Mining stocks were damaged by soft
demand for exports (stemming partly from the US recession), and
specifically by stagnant metals prices; all the key mining players
(Penoles, Grupo Mexico, Frisco and Sanluis) underperformed the
market.  The next two sectors from the bottom, Electricals and
Metallurgy, slipped badly in the second quarter, driving their first-half
positions down.  The Electrical sector was undermined by the poor
performances of Indetel and  Ericsson, which were not compensated by
a reasonable increase in Codumex.

Beating inflation but still below average were: Drinks, Food, Brokerage,
Insurance, Clothing, Tobacco, Consumer Goods, Paper, Engineering,
Stores, Autoparts and Chemicals.  Of these stocks, the advance in
financial stocks (Brokerage and Insurance) in the second quarter did not
overcome their relative stagnation in the first.  Meanwhile, of the main
marketable sectors, Paper and Stores drew back from their
overperformance in the previous year, while Chemicals continued to be
hurt by the US recession.

INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES

SECOND QUARTER

Of our 88-company sample, 31 overshot the Bolsa's general advance of
32% and 57 fell short of it (Table 5 in print copy of newsletter), while 29
matched or fell below the estimated 3% inflation for the period.  The
fifteen stocks that did not move at all (0% increase) reflect mostly lack
of marketability rather than price stagnation.

Financial companies dominated the top ten stocks.  The sharp increases
in the price of Vamsa (insurance), Atlanti (bank), Cbobsa (brokerage),
Confia (bank), and Promex (bank) all reflect the current euphoria about
bank privatization and the formation of financial groups.  Also
outperforming the index were Comermex, Banamex, Cremi, Bancen,
Bacomer, Banorie, Serfin, Banorte, Banoro, Intenal and Inverlat.  This
means that 16 of the 31 companies that outdid the index were financial
stocks.

Nonbank high achievers were Visa, a holding company with illiquid
stock whose price caught up with that of its key holding, Femsa; Cemex,
whose profits were improved by price increases and reduced debt; Vitro,
benefitting from the turnaround in Anchor; Sidek, boosted by investor
perceptions that it is the only strong tourism play in the market; and
Ttolmex, benefitting from higher cement prices.

In the below-inflation group, companies whose stocks are relatively
visible and marketable include telephone suppliers (Ericsson, Indetel and
Latinca), still subject to a squeeze from Telmex's new cost-minded
management; mining companies suffering from weak metals prices (e.g.
Frisco, Sanluis, Grupo Mexico, Penoles); and chemical exporters hit by
the US recession (Neromex, Celanese, Carbide, Borden). In the middle-
range are companies that did not keep up with the index but still did
quite well (by most country standards).  Femsa, Telmex, Cifra, Tamsa,
Apasco, Kimberly and CMA stocks are marketable and a positive case
can be made for their prospects.

FIRST SEMESTER

Over the first semester, 21 stocks raced ahead of the 68% gain in the
Bolsa index and 67 came in behind it, with 33 of these stocks
underperforming estimated inflation of 9% (Table 6 in print copy of
newsletter).

Of the 21 highest-ranking stocks, there continued to be a preponderance
of financial institutions: Atlanti, Promex, Cremi, Bancomer, Banamex,
Vamsa, Banoro, Serfin, Intenal.  However, unlike the second quarter
alone, they are not generally among the top performers; other,
nonfinancial stocks surpass them because of excellent performances in
both quarters.  These stocks include Cemex, Contal, Eaton, Nadro
Sidek, Tremec, and Ttolmex in the top seven places, with Telmex
placing 11, Visa 12, Vitro 16 and Apasco 19.

At the lower end of the scale are marketable companies in the Mining
(Sanluis, Frisco, Grupo Mexico) and Electrical (Indetel, Ericsson,
Latinca) groups.  The middle range contains several companies that did
well last year (Cifra, Sanborn, Kimberly, Crisoba) and appear to have
leveled off.

MARKET FACTORS

The major trends of the first and second quarters overlapped for the most
part, but with a marginally different emphasis.  The key driving forces
were as follows:

* Mexican investors focused on banks and financial companies.  Their
interest was only reinforced in the second quarter when prices under the
first three bank privatizations exceeded the most optimistic estimates.
This optimism spilled over into evaluations of most other financial
companies and lead to a leveling off of nonfinancial stocks.

* Foreign investor demand continued to set the tone for prices of non-
financial stocks (foreigners may not buy bank or brokerage stocks, and
insurance stocks are illiquid).  Foreigners continued to focus on highly
marketable, high-capitalization stocks with strong product focus and a
domestic orientation.  This explained the strength of companies such as
Contal and Sidek, the cement companies, and Telmex.  It also accounts
for the relative weakness of conglomerates such as Desc and Alfa).

* Weakness in the stocks of internationally oriented companies.
Chemical and mining operations continued to do poorly, as the market
remained uncertain about the duration of the US recession.

PROSPECTS

In our last report (XI-8), we stated that if Mexico reaches a historic
price/earnings multiple of 20, it would imply an index level of 1,150.
The index is not quite at this point yet, as we reckoned without the
earnings strength of the first quarter.  The index peak of 1,131 was
reached on June 6, with a historic P/E we calculate at around 18 and a
price/book value ratio of around 180%.

The outlook for further gains is favorable, as the same positive factors
will continue to operate in the market in the third quarter:

* strong earnings growth for most companies in 1991 combined with
better-than-expected GDP growth (higher than 4%);

* continued price flexibility under the Pact, permitting higher operating
and net profit margins;

* further reductions in nominal and real interest rates despite the current
blip (see MARKETS);

* continued foreign investment in the Mexican market; and

* ongoing improvements in capital market mechanisms.

Factors that could put a brake on stock prices include an increase in the
number of new stock issues, or a diversion of repatriated Mexican capital
away from the stock market and into bank privatizations.  However, on
most fundamental valuations, the Mexican market is still rated lower than
most Asian emerging markets with similar growth prospects.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Of the stocks in the MS portfolio, only two -- Cemex with 79% and
Ttolmex with 52% -- performed better than the average of 32% in the
second quarter.  The other stocks advanced as follows: Telmex 26%,
Cifra 25%, Kimberly 15%, and Codumex 6%.  Assuming an equal
weighting in each stock, this provides an average return of 34% against
the index average of 32%. Over the semester, the portfolio did even
better.  Stock gains have been: Cemex 210%, Ttolmex 121%, Telmex
92%, Cifra 60%, Kimberly 39%, and Codumex 38%.  Again equally
weighted, this would produce an average return of 93%, against the
market index of 68%.

Given the continued positive outlook for the market, we still recommend
retention of the existing portfolio at 30% (cost) in stocks.  We still have
not reached the point when out-of-favor stocks (Conglomerates, Mining,
Chemicals) will return to popularity: this could occur before our next
quarterly report, and we will advise readers accordingly.  Therefore, our
recommended peso stock portfolio remains invested in Cemex, Cifra,
Codumex, Kimberly, Telmex, and Ttolmex.
