ILLINOIS GOVERNOR MAY REVIVE PROPOSAL FOR CHICAGO BEARS' INDOOR STADIUM

By Aaron Baar
CHICAGO

     Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar may resurrect a plan to build an
indoor stadium for the Chicago Bears professional football team if a
proposal to renovate the team's current home, Soldier Field, is indeed
dead.
    "We plan to touch base with both the Bears and city hall to determine
the status of the renovation proposal," said Edgar spokesman Eric Robinson.
"If the governor is convinced the proposal is dead, he's prepared to
explore other avenues to keep the Bears in Chicago."
    One avenue favored by the governor is the possibility of building an
indoor, multi-use facility in the Chicago area that has become known as
"McDome," Robinson said.
    In the summer of 1995, state officials hinted that a domed stadium
could be built with bonds issued by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition
Authority. Although the authority has used most of its $937 million of bond
authorization, state officials had said it might be possible to issue
stadium bonds by refinancing existing debt, a plan that still may be
favored by Edgar.
    "The governor believes that a multipurpose facility could be built
without raising taxes," he said. Robinson would not give details about how
that might be done.
    In October, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled a $156 million plan
to renovate Soldier Field, the Bears' current home. The proposal calls for
the Chicago Park District to issue $100 million of taxable revenue bonds,
backed by annual club seat fees, revenues from permanent seat licenses,
concession fees, and a contribution from the team. The park district would
also issue the remaining $56 million of bonds payable with property tax or
other district revenues.
    Team officials have deemed the Soldier Field proposal unacceptable and
have reportedly declared negotiations with the city dead. However, Edgar
wanted to be assured of that demise before reviving the McDome possibility,
Robinson said.
    "In the environment we work in, things are never dead until they're
dead," he said. "We want to verify that from both sides (before moving
forward)."
    Meanwhile, a group of Indiana business leaders are continuing their
push to build a new, $312 million stadium for the Bears in Gary, Ind., to
be financed with taxable bonds issued by the group. About 60% of the bonds
would be repaid with various stadium-related private sources. The remaining
40% would be repaid from revenues from a proposed 0.5% economic development
income tax to be levied in the county.

    "Nothing that was written in their response successfully gets around
the fact that Merrill Lynch guided this county into bankruptcy."
    - J. Michael Hennigan, a lawyer for Orange County, arguing that it's
not enough for Merrill to say that the investments it chose for the county
were legal.

    "The emerging managers are to the pension fund what Pawtucket is to the
Boston Red Sox. The idea is that the farm team will, through good
performance, soon make the majors and be given more assets to invest."
    - Rhode Island Treasurer Nancy J. Mayer explaining her "emerging
managers" program, which gives small investment firms a chance to invest
state pension funds.

    "This is a money train, and if you get between the people who want the
money and the people who spend the money, you've got problems."
    - Franklin White, the former chief executive officer of the L.A.
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who was fired after an often bitter
struggle over Los Angeles' $5.8 billion bond-financed subway project.

    "He sent her to the dump, and I mean that literally - he sent her to
the county's Integrated Waste Management Department."
    - Steven J. Kaplan, the attorney for former Orange County finance
director Eileen T. Walsh, who has filed a discrimination lawsuit against
the county over her demotion.

    "People have taken their money out of closed-end funds to go play the
hotter games in town."
    - Donald L. Cassidy, senior researcher at Lipper Analytical Services
Inc., which found that the yields on municipal closed-end funds are
approaching taxable Treasury yields.

BOND VOLUME CAP, IN TROUBLE AGAIN, NEEDS REPAIR

By Joan Pryde
WASHINGTON

  - Every once in a while, something happens that puts the
private-activity bond volume cap - and its problems - in the spotlight, and
gives municipal bond proponents a chance to remind Congress the cap needs
fixing.
    The current problem stems from the federal government's partial
shutdown, which includes the Census Bureau, the agency responsible for
publishing the figures states use each year to compute the amounts they are
allowed to allocate to bond issuers.
    Under normal circumstances, Census would have released that report last
week, so that officials could begin this year knowing exactly how much they
have to work with. But because Census workers are on furlough, states will
have to wait awhile before they know what their 1996 cap amounts are going
to be.
    But the problem is even worse than that: If past experience is a guide,
states may not be able to use those population numbers when they eventually
come out.
    Back in 1990 Census issued the wrong figures during the last week of
December, and corrected itself with a new report in January. The Treasury
Department ruled that neither report conformed to the letter of the law,
and told states they had to go back and use their 1990 volume cap amounts
for 1991.
    If history repeats itself, states in 1996 will be stuck with year-old
volume caps again, and the largest states, which have growing populations
and huge demand for private-activity bond authority, will be hurt the most.
    One improvement over last time is that issuers probably will not have
to wait six months before the issue is resolved. When the 1991 snafu
occurred, the Treasury did not issue a ruling until July, leaving states in
the dark for the first half of the year - the period in which they
typically allocate most of their volume cap authority.
    The Treasury apparently learned its lesson from that debacle and has
been routinely issuing a revenue procedure a few weeks after the beginning
of each year, confirming that the numbers in the previous December's Census
report are the correct ones to use. Last week Treasury officials declined
comment on this latest mess, and it will be interesting to see how they
resolve the problem and whether they do so quickly.
    But the difficulties caused by the delayed Census report illustrate an
even deeper problem facing those who must live under the confines of the
cap: its inequity.
    Under the volume cap law, states are permitted each year to allocate
the greater of $50 per capita or $150 million in private-activity bond
authority. In 1995 that left 21 states at the $150 million level, and many
of those with more bond authority than they knew what to do with.
    But most of the larger states, which are stuck with $50 per capita, are
chafing under the cap's restrictions. They, of course, are the ones who
stand to be hurt if states are forced to revert to their 1995 allotments -
thus, not accounting for any growth in population - in 1996.
    There are other problems with the volume cap that affect all states.
Chief among them is the fact that the cap is not indexed for inflation, so
while in dollar terms the cap has remained constant, in reality it has
dropped over the last several years.
    In 1993 the Public Securities Association reported that inflation had
eroded the cap to the point where it was really $41.25 per capita, not $50,
and $120.8 million, not $150 million.
    Despite the problems that persist, legislation to ease the volume cap
has never caught fire in Congress. Rep. Bill Coyne, D-Pa., in 1993
introduced a broad bill to ease bond curbs, which included a provision that
would have indexed the cap for inflation. But Congress never acted on that
bill.
    Former Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, offered a proposal in 1993 designed to
help alleviate the cap's inequities. Grandy's proposal would have allowed
states with an overabundance of cap authority to shift the authority to
states that had used up their cap in a given year. But Congress took no
action on his measure, either.
    And so problems with the volume cap continue. If the population-report
mess creates enough difficulties for the states, 1996 may finally be the
year that Congress is forced to take a hard look at the volume cap law and
what can be done to improve it.

TRENDS IN THE REGION: LEASE REVENUES BUOY SACRAMENTO'S SKYLINE

By Joe Bel Bruno

    In sharp contrast to California's stagnant construction industry,
building projects rising in Sacramento have created a mini-boom in the
capital city.
    The skyline in downtown Sacramento has been reshaped to include more
high-rise buildings, many of them used by federal, local, and state
government. Money used to reinvent the city's downtown isn't coming from
private dollars, but instead from lease revenue bonds and other forms of
public finance.
    There are currently two large buildings being constructed and financed
through lease revenue bonds: the massive new federal office and court
building, and a new addition to the Sacramento Convention Center complex,
operated by the city. And what will be Sacramento's sixth major state-owned
building to go up in less than three years - an 850,000-square-foot office
building that will house the California Environmental Protection Agency -
is already in the planning stages.
    Critics complain that the state relies too heavily on expensive
financing in order to avoid getting voter approval for general obligation
bonds, which can be sold at a lower interest rate. Financing construction
projects with lease revenue bonds can cost the issuer up to twice as much
in interest as other forms of financing.
    "Using lease revenue bonds for construction is a fairly standard
practice," said Jerry Beavers of the California Legislative Analysts
Office. "We're putting out so much in interest that in the end, after the
bonds have been paid off, it costs almost double what it actually cost to
put up the building."
    Lease revenue bonds are paid off - typically over 20 years - from funds
formerly used to pay for leased buildings. Supporting the use of lease
revenue bonds is Gov. Pete Wilson, who contends that they are a good use of
taxpayers' money.
    However, some officials note that as the current upswing in
construction shows, the state is nibbling away at escaping its lease
obligations. Currently the state leases 7.2 million square feet of office
space around Sacramento, while it owns 5.1 million.
    "We've used lease revenue bonds for a long time to help finance
construction costs both (in Sacramento) and elsewhere," said Craig
Reynolds, chief of staff for state Sen. Lucy Killea, I-San Diego. "However,
there has been some talk in committee with the proposal of new construction
projects to take a closer look at the financing. This will likely happen."
    In general, state government is a major employer in Sacramento, hiring
62,600 at the seasonal peak, excluding college and university employees.
California employs 195,700 people statewide.
    Construction projects awaiting legislative approval include two massive
low-rise buildings in the city's suburbs and a cluster of new high-rise
buildings on state-owned property south and east of the capitol.
    One of the state buildings considered to be among the most extravagant
is owned by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. It is
designed with six terraced levels that are enclosed by outside walls and
concealed behind jasmine shrubbery that extends around the building for two
blocks. Offices open out to the man-made garden setting.
    However, because of its private funding, the building has received
little criticism. The $78 million cost was paid by using seven days' worth
of the investment returns on the organization's $94 billion portfolio.
Unlike other state agencies, CalPERS receives no tax-generated money.
    "I think the public would rather have the state build some of these
buildings using other, more cheaper ways ... or no public money at all,"
Beavers said. "There has been so much growth in the past few years, that
now we are realizing it is time to put a plan together that will manage it
better."
    Legislators are expected to soon devise a plan to organize and manage
the buildings, as well as develop a plan to regulate growth around
Sacramento.

MONEY MARKET FUNDS: YEAR-END UPSURGE IN TAX-FREE FUND YIELDS IS
TYPICAL, PLAYERS SAY

By Elizabeth Roy

    Tax-free money market fund yields shot up last week - but market
participants said the surge was typical year-end behavior.
    Meanwhile, the Dec. 22 downgrades by Standard & Poor's Corp. of four
Japanese banks that provide letters of credit for money market fund
securities has not affected trading, the participants said.
    They said the market had already priced in the downgrades.
    Standard & Poor's downgraded Mitsubishi Bank to A-plus from AA-minus,
Sanwa Bank to A from AA-minus, and the Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank to A from A-plus.
    On Thursday the rating agency also downgraded Fuji Bank, to A-minus
from A-plus. All five banks were placed on CreditWatch in August.
    Money market yields rise at year-end for two main reasons.
    First, demand wanes as retail investors withdraw funds either to cover
holiday or other expenses, or to avoid paying intangibles taxes in states
such as Florida and North Carolina. Those states tax investors based on
their holdings on the last day of the year.
    Institutional investors also retreat from money market funds in the
final weeks of the year, players said, either to make tax payments on Dec.
15, or to trim the number of investments they have to print on their year-
end balance sheets.
    At the same time, remarketing agents also want to enter the new year
with clean balance sheets. As a result, they offer money market funds high
yields on daily and weekly floaters in an effort to clear them from their
books.
    "We're obviously seeing a year-end spike, due to a lot of money that's
been leaving the arena," said Bradford Owensby, municipal securities
analyst for the $1.3 billion Nations Tax-Exempt Fund and the $110 million
Nations Municipal Reserve Fund.
    The investment adviser for the funds, a wholly owned subsidiary of
NationsBank of North Carolina, as of yesterday became known as TradeStreet
Investment Associates Inc.
    Referring to the high yields being offered on money market instruments,
Owensby said: "Dealers don't want inventory, so they've been jacking up
their rates."
    The high yields are aimed at corporate "crossover" buyers in particular
- those that can invest in either taxable or tax-free products, he added.
    Andrea White, assistant vice president in municipal trading at Harris
Trust and Savings Bank, agreed.
    "Yields have been going up fairly substantially," said White, whose
firm runs a $400 million tax-free money market fund and a $250 million
common trust fund.
    In the week leading up to last Wednesday, yields on weekly floaters
rose 45 basis points, and those on daily floaters were up 100 basis points,
she said.
    Also on Wednesday, White said, weekly floaters were yielding in the
4.95% to 5.10% range, compared to returns of 3.70% on tax-free commercial
paper maturing in February.
    After Jan. 1, however, short-term yields should drop down to about 2%
and stay there for at least a couple of weeks as cash flows back into money
market funds, she added.
    Only on July 1 do investors receive as much money in the form of coupon
payments and bonds maturing as they do on Jan. 1, White noted.
    The Harris money market funds have lost $15 million to $20 million in
recent weeks, but the managers expect to have to cope with $50 million of
inflows starting today, White said.
    Jim Hannan, vice president at First National Bank of Maryland and
manager of the $88 million ARK Funds Tax-Free Money Market Portfolio, said
some weekly floaters have been resetting at yields as high as 5.25% - a
taxable-equivalent yield of 8%.
    "The first week in January, that'll come down to 3.5%," he said.
    In the meantime, Hannan said, a money market fund yielding 4.25%, as
his was on Wednesday, offers a taxable-equivalent yield of 6.55% - 95 basis
points over the 5.60% that the typical taxable fund is offering crossover
buyers.
    Even so, Hannan's fund saw the assets of its institutional class drop
to $71 million from $80 million at the beginning of December, he said,
adding that he expects the money to return this month.

BROKER PROFILE: MUNI INVESTORS SHOULD AVOID FUNDS, BROKER SAYS

By Jon Birger

    Mutual funds offer far more advantages for equity investors than for
municipal bond investors, according to Bill Glassner, an independent broker
in Cedar Knolls, N.J., affiliated with Royal Alliance Associates Inc.
    With an equity fund, "a manager really adds value" compared to what a
broker can do, said Glassner, who has about 400 clients with accounts
totaling $150 million. "I don't have the time to research individual
companies on my own and give them the diversification they need."
    Municipal bond funds also offer diversification and expert research.
However, in Glassner's opinion, municipal funds' inherent interest rate
risk outweighs their advantages.
    For fixed-income investors, Glassner recommends only products with "a
finite life," principally bonds but also unit investment trusts, he said.
    When Glassner has clients who come to him with existing holdings in
bond funds, "I tell them, 'If you didn't like the fluctuations of 1994 -
not knowing where you stood with a fund - here's another approach: you can
buy the individual bond and no matter what happens with the ups and downs
of the market, you're going to get your money back.'
    "The individual client understands that even if everything goes wrong
like it did in 1994, they have a guaranteed value on a certain date," he
said. With a fund, there is no specific date when investors are guaranteed
full return of principal.
    While a patient fund investor should eventually recoup his full
investment - either through higher yields or appreciating shares -  "it's
harder for the unsophisticated client to visualize that," Glassner said.
    One of the few scenarios in which Glassner does recommend bond funds is
for investors interested in the high-yield sector of the municipal market.
    "I only use funds for things that I can't efficiently buy on my own,"
he said. "On the (high-yield) muni side, I use a fund that has the
resources and the people to research the small deals - the unrated deals -
and to diversify in a portfolio in order to make it safer."
    Glassner's favorite high-yield fund is the Van Kampen Merritt Tax Free
High Income Fund.
    About 40% of Glassner's accounts is invested in municipals - the
remainder divided about equally between equities and taxable mortgage-
backed securities.
    A self-described bargain hunter in the equity market, Glassner takes
few such risks when buying individual municipal bonds.
    Municipal bond investors "are basically looking for safety," he said.
"I go out of my way to be real safe."
    While Glassner said he understands why many yield-hungry institutional
portfolio managers prefer A or triple-B rated bonds, he does not recommend
this strategy for retail buyers.
    Individual investors who buy municipals want peace of mind, he said.
    "And especially with these low yields (and narrow credit quality
spreads), you're picking up so little extra by taking the uninsured bond,"
he said.
    About 70% of Glassner's clients are New Jersey residents. He generally
advises these investors to buy Garden State bonds in order to take
advantage of the in-state tax advantage.
    Interest earned on New Jersey bonds is exempt from the state income
tax, which is 6.58% for individuals in the top tax bracket.
    "I'm not too concerned about the New Jersey economy," Glassner said of
his clients' high exposure in the state. "But I will buy a state like Texas
if I see enough yield to cover the New Jersey tax."
    Some of Glassner's best-selling New Jersey issuers include the state of
New Jersey itself, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
    He and his clients also like northern New Jersey municipalities such as
Essex County, Parsippany, and West Orange Township Board of Education.
    "Investors are generally a little more comfortable if they know the
town," he said.
    Glassner is a big fan of zero-coupon bonds, particularly for investors
with a specific time horizon.
    "I use the zeros a lot," he said. "I have a lot of people who just
don't care about the income and they love buying a bond at 25 cents on the
dollar or 50 cents if it's shorter.
    "And I also find higher yields there because the marketplace doesn't
really like (zero-coupon bonds). In general they want the bonds with the
cash flow."
    Zero-coupon bonds issued by Camden County Municipal Utility District
have been among his top sellers, according to Glassner.
    Because Camden is one of New Jersey's most economically depressed
areas, these bonds "don't trade real well, so we end up with a good yield,"
he said. "They're insured, and we're going to hold them" to maturity.
    For sophisticated investors willing to take on a little risk, Glassner
recommends housing bonds.
    "Some people view the fact that there can be an unpredictable,
extraordinary redemption as a negative," he said. "I view that as a
positive."
    Investors are compensated for the call risk with above-market yields,
he explained.
    "You can sometimes get a real high coupon at a very small premium with
a housing bond," Glassner said. "I usually view a three- or six-month
break-even period as fair, but I've got to find a client who knows there's
a little risk of losing the premium a day after he buys it."
    Glassner's clients generally buy bonds in the four- to 12-year maturity
range - "though I do have some clients who will go out 30 years as part of
a laddered portfolio.
    "In general, people are looking for 5%" yield, he continued. "Five
percent seems to be the psychological barrier right now."
    Investors seem to have adjusted to long-term yields in the 5% to 5.5%
range, according to Glassner.
    "The area where I get the most resistance is in the shorter end, where
they're taking 4% or 4.25% for a maturity that they don't think is that
short - four to eight years," he said. "A lot of clients would rather leave
the money in cash."
    As for the flat tax, Glassner said neither he nor his clients are
particularly concerned.
    "Nobody's really talking about it - it hasn't come up at all (in
conversations with clients) during the second half of the year," he said.
    Glassner does not believe a flat tax will pass. And even if it did -
thereby reducing municipals' resale value - investors who hold their bonds
to maturity would not be affected, he said.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER PROFILE: CONSERVATIVE MANAGING CAN REAP REWARDS

By Sarah Stirland

     A top performance can be achieved even with a conservative strategy,
according to Ronald H. Schwartz, portfolio manager of STI Capital
Management's $150 million STI Classic Investment Grade Tax-Exempt Bond
Fund.
    Schwartz's portfolio has consistently landed among the top five
performing intermediate funds over last three years.
    But he said he achieves his results incrementally. "Our philosophy is
that we don't try to hit a home run," he said.
    "We don't feel like we can forecast interest rates far out into the
future accurately for a long time period, so we will have our short-term
bias based on our fundamental and technical analysis - we're not going to
make major bets by any means," he said.
    In addition to managing the intermediate bond fund, Schwartz oversees a
total of $1.4 billion in municipals in a Florida fund and two common trust
funds.
    But it is the intermediate bond fund that has regularly appeared in the
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. top-five performer rankings this year.
    Schwartz's fund recorded a one-year total return to the end of the
third quarter of 11.31%, ranking first out of 111 intermediate funds.
    In 1994, Lipper named the portfolio top performer in its class.
    Nothing Out of the Ordinary
    Despite this achievement, Schwartz describes his investment strategy as
doing nothing particularly out of the ordinary.
    Schwartz has kept the average maturity of the fund relatively short,
currently at seven and a half years, with an average duration of five
years.
    That positioning is in keeping with his philosophy of not making big
interest rate bets, he said.
    "If we're bullish on the market we'll extend the average maturity to
eight years, but we're not going to say: 'We know interest rates are going
to go lower, let's change this average maturity from seven and a half years
to 15 years,' " he said.
    Instead, Schwartz said that he will extend or contract his maturities
slightly from his neutral level of seven and a half years, according to his
rate forecast.
    "It's the unknowns that really move this market and you can't predict
those," he added.
    Instead, Schwartz uses yield curve analysis to find value and to
achieve his goal of the highest total return possible.
    "We constantly look at the current yield curve market and look at where
on the yield curve would be best to invest," he said.
    Currently, Schwartz is buying in the intermediate area, where he thinks
the value is.
    In this 15- to 20-year sector, he said, investors can find yields
almost as high as those on 30-year bonds with less risk.
    "When you go out 10 more years to the 30 years, all you pick up is 10
basis points," he said.
    Risk-Reward Ratio
    "We don't feel that risk-reward ratio is to your benefit, so let's take
less risk by going into the 20-year area and all we give up is maybe five
to 10 basis points - that's worthwhile, to us," he explained.
    "You're basically getting 98% of the 30-year bond with the 20-year
bond, so you're taking less risk or volatility while earning 98% of the 30-
year bond," he added.
    In addition to using to using yield curve analysis, he gauges value by
comparing municipals to Treasury securities, he said.
    The intermediate area also currently looks attractive using this
measure, he said.
    At the moment Schwartz is pursuing a barbell strategy.
    In addition to extending his maturity out to about eight years at the
beginning of 1995 when he was optimistic about the market, he has been
buying prerefunded bonds at the short end of the curve.
    "They've been yielding 78% to 80% of Treasuries - that's a very
attractive ratio for the shorter end and for something that is the most
secure bond in the market," he said.
    Schwartz's barbell approach involves buying securities in the one- to
six-year area and in the 15- to 20-year area.
    "We feel like that's the area of the curve that has the best return
potential in this kind of environment," he said.
    Schwartz said that although there is nothing unusual about his
strategy, he manages to find value because the STI fund is a national one
and can also, like many other national portfolios, take advantage of the
supply and demand inequities that crop up in the market at different times
of the year, he said.
    This ability to pick and choose between the different states gives him
an edge over state-specific funds, he said.
    Tracking Prices
    Schwartz said that he also makes the most of market inefficiencies by
keeping records of the price levels at which different bonds trade.
    "We do very extensive historic relationship spreads of how bonds should
trade against each other," he said.
    "For example, how should a general obligation bond trade versus a
revenue bond? How should a specialty-state bond trade versus a non-
specialty-state bond? How should a premium bond trade versus a discount
bond," he said.
    Schwartz buys and trades according to the aberrations he sees in these
historic relationships, he said.
    Currently, he is taking advantage of the oversupply of bonds and then
waiting for the New Year to roll in when a lot of bonds mature, are called
or make their coupon payments.
    He estimates that more than $40 billion of cash will flood the market
in January - bringing demand, which he believes will create a good selling
climate.
    As part of his strategy of managing by making small but progressive
changes to his portfolio, Schwartz will trade bonds even if they only give
him a slight advantage, he said.
    "If Floridas are trading expensive and Washington bonds are trading
cheap, then I will do that trade and earn a quarter and give that return to
investors," he said.
    Feeling Optimistic
    At the moment, Schwartz has extended his portfolio because he has
started to feel optimistic about the market again, after worrying, earlier
this year, that the rally had run its course this year.
    In addition, he has been buying intermediate bonds because they are
looking attractive again at the moment.
    "In the 15-year area, we have seen yields as expensive as 85%, as cheap
as 88.3% and it's currently at 88.2%, so you see it's at one of the
cheapest areas versus Treasuries for the last three months, and over the
past year, it's been as cheap as 89.4%," he said.
    Schwartz said he does not like to take credit risk either.
    "We've seen too many investors reaching for yield and buying credits
that are not adequately compensating them for the risk," he said.
    Areas he avoids are housing bonds and utility bonds, he said.
    Schwartz's avoidance of housing bonds fits with his philosophy that
total return is the best measure of performance rather than income.
    He believes that portfolios that rely on income are not as worthwhile
as funds that rely on total return because total return measures the total
value of the portfolio - not just the income, which could be boosted by
sacrificing capital.
    Housing bonds in particular give investors high coupon payments but
their value often amortizes as the securities age, not to mention they miss
out on the chance to benefit from rising prices.
    "A housing bond is going to give you a lot of income, but in a bull
market, those bonds are not going to appreciate very much at all because
they are going to be called and the investor is not going to see that in
the total return number," he said.
    "In a year like this past year, if you just had housing bonds, you
could never have a 13% return," he added.
    He points to the Securities and Exchange Commission's 1993 ruling that
funds must compare their performance with an index in their prospectuses as
an example of how important achieving a high total return is.
    Schwartz added that he believes total return is the best measure of a
fund's performance despite the fact that it ignores investors' tax brackets
and any capital gains tax liability that may be created.
    Despite his bias toward total return, Schwartz believes that funds that
emphasize current income will still flourish.
    "I think that current income funds are going to be around and will do
well.

SOUTHWEST BOND-WATCH



California
    Six months after former Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. - known as
the state's leading political powerbroker - takes over the San Francisco
mayor's office, a new city charter will make him even more powerful.
    The 90-page charter was approved by voters in the city's November
primary and gives the mayor authority over parts of local government that
were once off limits to politicians.
    The expanded duties include management of all bond-funded and capital
projects, including a $200 million voter-approved renovation of city hall.
That function is now handled by an autonomous chief administrative officer
appointed by the Board of Supervisors.
    Brown will also have the power to play a stronger role in forming San
Francisco's $2.8 billion annual budget.
    "This should eliminate some of the chaos and nonperformance of city
government," Brown said in a press statement. "More things get done if
there is one person you can absolutely rely on."
    Brown was elected mayor Dec. 12 after serving in the Legislature for
more than a quarter century, including 14 years as Assembly speaker.

    Oregon
    In its first major financing as an independent corporation, the Oregon
Health Sciences University late last month announced it will sell $211.8
million of revenue bonds, both to fund a number of projects and to refund
old debt.
    About $110 million of the proceeds are slated to replace patient areas
in Doernbecher Children's Hospital, and expand its adult and pediatric
critical-care facilities.
    Another $20 million will be used to update laboratories and catch up on
deferred maintenance of the teaching hospital's instructional and research
facilities. And $59 million will be used to refund prior issues.

    Wyoming
    The Internal Revenue Service has approved a program that uses state
funds to back general obligation bonds issued by local school districts,
allowing them to borrow with higher credit ratings, according to a
statement released by Cheyenne law firm Rothegerber, Appel, Powers, &
Johnson.
    "This ruling will allow the state to go forward with the School Bond
Guarantee Program for public education in the state," state auditor Dave
Ferrari said in the prepared statement. Ferrari helped draft the 1994
legislation that established the program.
    The ruling - issued in a private letter from the IRS - grants Wyoming
the approval needed to continue the program.
    "The ruling was essential in order for the program to operate as
intended," said Gregory Johnson, an attorney with the firm, which was
counsel to the state in seeking approval.
    Under the program, part of the $800 million Common School Account in
the Permanent Land Fund can be used to guarantee payment of principal and
interest on school-district issued GO bonds.
    IRS approval was sought to ensure the tax exempt status of the state-
backed local school bonds, officials said.

NEW TREASURERS: KENTUCKY'S JOHN HAMILTON STRESSES A HANDS-ON STYLE

By David Kaplan

    Two of John Kennedy Hamilton's foremost goals as he takes the office of
Kentucky treasurer this week are to adopt a more hands-on approach to
managing the state's $2.7 billion short-term cash fund and to develop a
state-run local government investment pool.
    Hamilton describes himself as a conservative businessman but a
Democrat. "With a name like 'John Kennedy,' how could I be anything else?"
he said. He also noted that at 32, he's Kentucky's youngest treasurer this
century.
    Despite the fact that Hamilton completed only one year toward his
bachelor's degree at Lexington Community College, he is credited with
"turning a failing (transportation) business around and increasing gross
revenue by $350,000."
    The company, United Transportation Inc. of Lexington, was where
Hamilton honed his managerial skills as president from 1983 - the year he
left college - to August 1995.
    Hamilton, a political neophyte, plans on exploring the possibility of
expanding the treasurer's investment activities - perhaps by adding
management of an LGIP to the office's responsibilities.
    "We're going to work more closely with Kentucky's finance secretary and
the revenue cabinet compared to the last treasurer," Hamilton said. "Those
two agencies play an essential role in the state's investment programs.
There needs to be an active and independent participant involved."
    When pressed for details, Hamilton said he is interested in expanding
the treasurer's presence in investment policy decisions, but not
necessarily his authority.
    Hamilton succeeds another Democrat, Frances Jones Mills, who served
three separate terms as Kentucky's treasurer, the first beginning in 1976.
    "Ms. Mills often didn't attend the meetings of the State Investment
Commission," he said. "She would often send a surrogate. That will not
happen with me. But as far as any changes in investment policies, I will
have to learn more about the process before proposing anything."
    Under state law, the treasurer serves as vice chairman of the State
Investment Commission, which meets quarterly and essentially acts as an
oversight board.
    The day-to-day operation of the cash fund is conducted by the Office of
Financial Management and Economic Analysis.
    "Historically, the Investment Commission approves policies and
procedures and the staff of my office implements their decisions," said Don
Mullis, executive director of the financial management office.
    There is currently at least one LGIP in the state, but that is operated
by the Kentucky Municipal League and the Kentucky Association of Counties,
Mullis noted.
    Although the state is permitted to establish an investment pool, one
has never been authorized, Mullis said.
    "If such a pool were begun, it would in all likelihood start with the
Investment Commission and be managed and administered by this office,"
Mullis added.
    Kentucky's cash fund is doing fairly well, Hamilton said, pointing to
the revenue surplus of several million dollars. He said he hopes to enhance
the surplus by examining ways to boost returns for the state's cash fund.
    "For me the biggest challenge ahead is restoring the sense of integrity
of this office," Hamilton said. "So maintaining a strong presence on the
Investment Commission will be a good step in that direction."

NONPROFIT IOWA HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGE

CHICAGO

    Two not-for-profit health systems in Iowa have signed a
preliminary agreement to merge, leaving unclear the status of $220 million
of outstanding debt.
    Officials of the Iowa Health System last week approved a memorandum of
understanding to merge with St. Luke's Health System. The memorandum is
good until March 1; Scott Eldridge, chief financial officer of St. Luke's,
said he expects the final agreement to be reached late next month.
    St. Luke's now has about $70 million of outstanding tax-exempt debt,
Eldridge said. All of the health system's bonds have been sold with
insurance, and therefore carry a triple-A rating, he added.
    The Iowa Health System has about $150 million of outstanding tax-exempt
revenue debt, according to chief financial officer William Miller. He said
the debt is rated A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and A1 by Moody's
Investors Service.
    "I can't really say what will happen to the debt in the merged
organization because it hasn't been decided yet," said Eldridge.
    "We're sorting out those options now," echoed Miller. "One thing we
know for sure is that there certainly won't be a refinancing."
    Eldridge suggested that the two groups may become jointly obligated for
the combined $220 million of debt now outstanding.
    "It looks like ultimately, we will (both) be fully responsible for all
the debt of the merged organization, instead of carrying individual debt
for each operating unit," he added.
    Eldridge said Sioux City-based St. Luke's decided to merge with Des
Moines-based Iowa Health System primarily to capture a bigger share of
statewide managed-care health contracts.
    "Both systems are strong, and they'll be getting stronger through the
merger," said Eldridge. "We view it as a way to attract more (primary care)
physicians into our systems."

SCHOOLS' NEEDS ARE FERTILE GROUND

By Kieran Beer

    There was a time when immigrant children from all over the world got
their first taste of the American dream at the local public school.
    Public schools constructed in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s were safe,
clean, well-lit places. Some of them were even elegant structures,
expressions of the nation's faith in public education and the opportunity
for personal advancement.
    Times certainly have changed. The structures built decades ago, which
served to school other generations, are in decay, and there seems to be
little public will to restore them or to build new schools.
    That certainly is the conclusion of the page one story that ran in the
New York Times the day after Christmas. The story cited hard numbers from
the Government Accounting Office that $112 billion is needed to renovate
old schools and build new ones. Despite that need, states, municipalities,
and school districts are spending less than ever on schools'
infrastructure.
    The Times account also offered anecdotal evidence of our neglect of
schools that sound like accounts of life in the third world: a collapsed
ceiling in Montgomery County, Ala., that could have injured children; a
leaky roof and condemned gymnasium in a New York City school; and termite
infestation in New Orleans.
    Like any crisis, the state of the infrastructure of America's public
schools has myriad causes. Among these are overcrowding caused by a new
wave of immigrants - particularly in places like Texas, Florida,
California, and New York - and the fact that baby boomers have produced
their own boomlet of school-age children. But no confluence of problems
excuses our society's indifference to children and to the dark future such
indifference will create.
    All of this provides muni bankers with an opportunity to be the good
guys, despite all the heat they have taken during the debate about a flat
tax. A number of flat tax proponents have characterized muni bankers -
referring to them as Wall Street bankers to emphasize their distance from
Main Street - as an ignoble lot who, in league with government bureaucrats,
help fund boondoggles and profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Well,
building and repairing schools is not a boondoggle - it is a noble
endeavor.
    But to be the good guys, the municipal bond community will need to
continue to reinvent itself. Even as a number of more nimble firms are
looking at project finance and other alternative methods of finance, the
municipal bond community should be exploring both traditional and new ways
to build new schools and repair existing ones.
    Alternative methods of finance are necessary given the anti-tax, anti-
spend political climate. Brokering a private-public partnership between the
information technology vendors and the states to upgrade schools is one
place to start.
    Another reason creative methods of finance will be needed for education
infrastructure is that education itself needs to undergo revolutionary
change. Even as we try to figure out ways to give kids good one-on-one
learning experiences with teachers, it is important to apply the revolution
in information technology to education. (Hence, the importance of the
information technology companies.)
    There is no reason that a state's best teachers - or even the country's
- should not be accessible electronically to thousands of children
regardless of the school districts they live in, one member of the
municipal bond community observed. "Schools ought to look more like the
Sony Movie Megaplex than Adlai Stevenson (Intermediate High School)," said
an investment banker.
    There are many obstacles - including the need to work out the tension
between local and regional control of schools. But a vision that returns to
making school structures express our faith in education and the future is
worth fighting for.

NEWS AND TRENDS: SOUTH CAROLINA TREASURY VOLUNTEERS EARN HAPPY RETURNS
OVER HOLIDAYS

By Richard Richtmyer

    While most public employees in South Carolina were doing their last-
minute holiday shopping on Dec. 23, Treasurer Richard A. Eckstrom and
several Treasury staffers were busy with some shopping of their own -
hunting for bargains in the capital markets.
    And on Dec. 26, while the malls were jammed with people waiting in line
to make their holiday shopping returns, the state Treasury was looking for
higher returns on South Carolina's surplus funds.
    Although both days were official state holidays, the treasurer and some
staff members volunteered their time - while investment banks and the
Federal Reserve were open - in an effort to boost the returns on state
funds that otherwise would have remained dormant, according to John
Pownall, deputy treasurer in charge of investments.
    In all, the state Treasury managed to pick up about $11,300 in extra
income on $152 million in idle funds over the holidays, Pownall said. The
total returns were about $93,700, while they would have been about $82,400
had the funds been allowed to remain dormant, earning about 4.8%, he
said.
    The state picked up the extra income by investing in five-day
repurchase agreements with state banks, Pownall said.
    Eckstrom and Pownall, along with Treasury staff members Faye Nealy,
Leanne Register, and Chuck Sanders, participated in the volunteer effort,
which was the second time the group had volunteered on holidays. The first
was on Nov. 24, the Friday after Thanksgiving.
    During that holiday, though, the extra earnings were less - about
$3,000 extra on a total investment of $43 million, Pownall said.
    The idea for the volunteer program came from long-time treasury staffer
Ken Cliatt, Pownall said.
    "As soon as we took office, (Cliatt) sent me an e-mail message telling
me that he had been suggesting this for some time," Pownall said. "He
thought there was some low-hanging fruit here that we could take advantage
of. And we thought that this was just too good an idea to pass up - it's
just common sense, basic investing."
    Although the extra earnings are not earmarked for charities because of
statutory restrictions, the benefits will be passed on to the people of the
state, who can in turn pass them on to the state's needy, Pownall said.
    "(Giving the money to charity) is a great idea, but unfortunately it's
something that the law wouldn't allow us to do," Pownall said.
    "But we think that to the extent that the taxpayers have a little extra
money in their pockets, maybe they can put it to use in charities or other
causes," he continued.
    "It may be a Christmas present to the taxpayers."

WHAT'S SELLING: COLORADO PAPER RATES COMING BACK TO EARTH AFTER BUSY
DECEMBERBY SARAH STIRLAND


    Colorado paper is currently trading at rates that are less
stratospheric than usual, according to Richard O'Connor, a municipal trader
in Kirkpatrick Pettis' Denver office.
    "Sometimes Colorado paper gets levels out for the bid that you can't
believe," he said.
    Last Wednesday, "Colorado paper got a number that you would consider a
strong general-market number. It wasn't trading as though there were no
Colorado paper around."
    O'Connor attributes this change to the lack of market participants at
this time of year and November's flood of issuance in the state.
    Normally, Colorado municipal bonds trade at above-market levels because
Amendment 1 has made in-state paper scarce. The amendment mandates that all
new bond issuance must be voter-approved.
    In early December, retail investors in Colorado were gobbling up
prerefunded bonds with a vengeance.
    "There was a huge appetite for prerefunds - you couldn't find bonds.
There was so much retail appetite because a lot of money came due Dec. 1,"
he said. "You could easily sell a $1 million block of prerefunded bonds."
    Many retail investors, who tend to be older retirees, have a preference
for these types of Treasury-backed securities or for other triple-A rated
names because of previous bad experiences with higher yielding credits,
O'Connor said.
    "When you have your older investors who have been burned in the past on
lesser credits, they don't care what it is so long as it's Moody's
(Investors Service) and (Standard & Poor's Corp.) triple-A," he said.
    To get his hands on prerefunded Colorado bonds, O'Connor contacted
mutual funds that owned the securities and offered them high prices, he
said.
    "You pay them what would appear at the time a fairly stellar number for
bonds - they couldn't necessarily turn you down and you turn around and
flip (the bonds) in a phone call," he said.

CALIFORNIA QUAKE AUTHORITY SLATES BOND SALE

LOS ANGELES

    The newly formed California Earthquake Authority has
slated a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Co. to underwrite a $1.5 billion
revenue bond sale later this year, part of the $10.5 billion in funds the
new agency needs.
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Bear Stearns & Co. are also among the major
firms in the syndicate, according to the announcement from insurance
commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
    In addition to the bond sale, other funding sources for the authority's
plan to pay homeowner earthquake damage claims includes $1 billion in cash
contributions from insurance companies, and another $3 billion in funds
promised by insurance companies if necessary to pay claims.
    The plan also includes $2 billion from reinsurers, $1 billion assessed
from earthquake insurance policy holders, and $2 billion from additional
assessments on insurers, Quackenbush spokesman Richard Wiebe said.
    Quackenbush, elected in November 1994, returned last month from a two-
week global jaunt aimed at seeking reinsurance for the new authority.
    Gov. Pete Wilson in October signed into a law a bill appropriating
$500,000 to investigate the viability of an earthquake insurance authority
and laying much of the groundwork needed for its start-up.
    Quackenbush and Wilson proposed the authority's creation last summer in
the wake of an exodus of homeowner's insurance carriers after massive
damage claims stemming from the January 1994 Northridge earthquake near Los
Angeles.

PROBE OF EL PASO COUNTY, COLO., FUND BROADENS TO EXAMINE TREASURER

By Darrell Preston
DALLAS

    An investigation into the El Paso County, Colo. pension fund
has widened to include treasurer Sharon Shipley.
    El Paso County district attorney John Suthers' office confirmed last
week that Shipley is now being included in an investigation centering on
former pension fund manager Mike Witty.
    Witty resigned from the pension board in 1994 after the county
discovered there was no bidding process when he was awarded consulting
contracts to oversee the $80 million fund's real estate investments,
according to county officials.
    However, the inclusion of Shipley in the inquiry is not expected to
have any immediate impact on the treasurer's office or county finances or
operations, said Ken Kile, deputy county treasurer.
    "I don't believe it's gotten to the point where it will have much
effect," said Kile.
    Shipley, who is still on the job, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
    Suthers' investigation began after the county learned of a secret,
unauthorized bank account that Witty allegedly set up in the fund's name in
1993. Since then, two audits have been launched, including one by the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which county commissioners approved in
early December.
    But last week Suthers announced that his investigation had grown to
include charges that Shipley and pension fund board member Carl Hatton
borrowed thousands of dollars from Witty while he was awarded consulting
work.
    Hatton resigned from the board after Suthers' announcement Dec. 26, but
Shipley, who served as chairwoman of the pension fund until Dec. 20,
remains on the board. The new chairman is Dan May, a deputy district
attorney who has been on the board since 1994.
    Hatton and Witty could not be reached by press time.
    An audit county commissioners released Dec. 18 found that while Witty
controlled county pension funds, they were invested heavily in real estate.
The report by Aurora, Colo.-based Comiskey & Co. found that the fund's
concentration in real estate increased to 34% from zero between 1992 and
1994.
    An earlier audit in May 1994 noted that besides his $55,000 salary to
manage the fund, Witty earned more than $500,000 in 1993 and 1994 under his
contract with the fund as a private consultant to oversee the fund's real
estate investments.

WHAT TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA BUDGET SURPLUS

LOS ANGELES

    When California Journal - a Sacramento-based political
monthly magazine - recently asked a number of state budget observers about
a hypothetical surplus of $1 billion, it got responses ranging from doubt
that such a positive number could ever occur to calls for tax cuts.
    Stephen Zimmermann, Western region managing director for Standard &
Poor's Corp. in San Francisco, said in the Journal's January issue that
California's first priority must be to pass a true balanced budget - one
that doesn't require crossover borrowing from one fiscal year to another.
He also suggested a reasonable reserve of at least several percent of the
budget.
    "As for further bonded debt, we'd like to see a real capital needs plan
that prioritizes expenditures funded by bonds," Zimmermann told the state's
leading political journal.
    "California's current debt service is now about 5% of the budget," he
added. "That's considered moderate, so increasing it is not particularly a
problem, as long as the capital expenditures are orderly and planned."
    Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,
suggested that a surplus ought to retire bond debt to improve the state's
bond ratings.
    The anti-tax activist also told the Journal that some taxes should be
trimmed, and suggested that the state's massive surplus under former Gov.
Ronald Reagan in 1974 led to pressure that brought about tax and bonding
limits under Proposition 13.

MOODY'S SEES NEXT HUD BILL HAVING 'FAR-REACHING' IMPACT ON BONDS

By Joan Pryde
WASHINGTON

    Moody's Investors Service says provisions in the still-
unresolved HUD appropriations bill for fiscal 1996 set the stage for major
changes in bond-related federal housing programs next year when lawmakers
draft legislation reauthorizing those programs.
    "While the housing appropriations bill did not contain substantial
changes to Section 8 or FHA insurance, it would appear to indicate that the
final outcome of the Capitol Hill debate on housing programs may have more
far-reaching implications for bonds backed by such federal housing
assistance, as well as for bondholder security," Moody's said in a recent
report.
    Congress passed the funding bill for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and agencies within HUD such as the Federal Housing
Administration, in late November. President Clinton vetoed the measure on
Dec. 18, because he disagreed with funding levels of other agencies in the
bill not related to HUD. Congress is expected to try to fashion a new bill
more to his liking.
    Among the HUD provisions in the vetoed bill important to the municipal
market, one would have given HUD temporary authority to renew expiring
subsidy contracts under the Section 8 rent subsidy program. The provision
is designed to keep alive revenue streams for bond-financed multifamily
housing projects under the program while Congress in 1996 comes up with a
plan for revamping the Section 8 program.
    Although Moody's said the provision is helpful to keep those projects
going, the bill does not provide for subsidy increases during the next
year, which could cause problems.
    "Extending contracts at current contract rents for one year would keep
subsidy levels constant," the ratings agency said in a report titled
Moody's Monitors Rating Implications of HUD Debate. "To the extent,
however, that expenses increase while subsidy levels remain constant, this
may signal the beginning of new financial stresses for these projects,
subject to the economics of individual projects."
    The Clinton administration and Congress want to overhaul the Section 8
program because the federal government cannot afford to renew the thousands
of subsidy contracts set to expire in the next several years. The
administration has proposed transforming the subsidies - which now are paid
to project owners - into certificates issued directly to tenants.
    For projects also backed by FHA insurance, the administration has
proposed requiring owners to "mark to market" - that is, adjust their
contract rents to market levels and restructure their underlying debt. In
the event that the lower rent could not support a given mortgage, the loan
would go into default, and a claim would be made against the FHA insurance
fund.
    The appropriations bill just vetoed by Clinton included a provision
that would have permitted HUD to begin testing its mark-to-market plan on
15,000 units of multifamily housing out of a total of about 800,000 that
receive Section 8 subsidies.
    Moody's said that trial would be instructive, because the big question
about mark-to-market is whether the FHA can handle a big influx of
insurance claims that is sure to result if the program is fully
implemented.
    "While the ratings on these bonds are based on the FHA insurance, a
question remains as to the ability of FHA to process and pay claims in a
timely fashion," especially if implementation of mark-to-market sharply
increased the number of claims that the housing agency was having to
process, Moody's said.
    If that were to happen, "Moody's view on these bonds could be
affected," the ratings agency said.
    Moody's said it has requested information from state housing finance
agencies regarding their multifamily portfolios "to better gauge the impact
of potential changes to the programs."
    "In the course of our ongoing surveillance efforts, we are maintaining
a dialogue with the agencies regarding the ways in which they are preparing
for potential changes which could affect their Section 8 portfolios,"
Moody's said.

CHANCES DWINDLE FOR REFORM OF THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACT

By Martha M. Canan

    The prospects for overhauling the Glass-Steagall Act have dimmed
considerably since last year because commercial banking and insurance
interests cannot resolve a dispute over bank insurance powers.
    As a result, the issue of whether banks should have authority to
underwrite municipal revenue bonds is being held hostage to the insurance
dispute, which threatens to derail House banking reform legislation this
year, lobbyists say.
    If Congress does not act on Glass-Steagall this year, the Federal
Reserve Board is expected to come under increasing pressure to expand bank
securities powers, including the ability to underwrite revenue bonds,
through regulatory action.
    The effort to reform the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits
mixing commercial and investment banking, gained momentum last spring when
the House Banking and Commerce committees passed a bill that would allow
banks and securities firms to affiliate through holding companies.
    The legislation would give banks new power to underwrite revenue bonds,
in addition to existing authority to directly underwrite less lucrative
general obligation bonds. However, banks would be required to engage in
such new activity only through separately capitalized holding-company
affiliates. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed banks to
directly underwrite revenue bonds, but the current language omits that
authority.
    The dispute between the commercial banking and insurance industries
involves a provision in a related regulatory relief bill that would halt
for at least five years any regulatory effort by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency to expand bank insurance powers. A related
issue is whether to allow banks under federal law to affiliate with
insurance companies.
    Insurance interests strongly oppose letting commercial banks into their
business, while commercial banking interests view insurance activities as
essential to their ability to compete with other financial services
providers in a technologically advanced global marketplace.
    The insurance dispute has prevented the House leadership from bringing
the Glass-Steagall bill to the floor, because lawmakers do not want to
choose between the two influential industries, which contribute heavily to
political campaigns. House leaders have long planned to combine the Glass-
Steagall and regulatory relief measures into one package for a floor vote.
    Months-long negotiations between banking and insurance industry
representatives and House leaders and staff - including Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and
Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa - have made little progress
towards crafting a compromise.
    In a recent letter to Thomas Labrecque, chairman and chief executive
officer of Chase Manhattan Corp. and member of the Bankers Roundtable,
Leach expressed his frustration with what he views as the intransigence of
banks that oppose any change in the U.S. comptroller's powers on bank
insurance, sources said.
    The letter, which the Banking Committee and the Roundtable refused to
release, prompted speculation that Leach may be ready to suspend or
terminate the talks, although some lobbyists said they could not imagine
Leach pulling the plug after all the effort he has put into passage of the
bill.
    A subsequent press release issued by the American Council of Life
Insurance last Thursday reinforced the pressure Leach appears to be putting
on the banks. The council "noted with regret the failure of negotiations
this year regarding insurance provisions contained in (the reform bill)."
The statement said ACLI officials "expressed frustration with the 'delaying
tactics' employed by banking representatives to reach a workable
compromise."
    The council, which represents 600 insurance companies, charged the
banking interests with being "inflexible," while saying that insurance
companies have made "significant concessions."
    But Alfred Pollard, senior director at the Roundtable, said the
statement reflects "the complexity and difficulty" of the numerous
insurance issues under discussion. "There has been no effort to delay on
our part," he said.
    At this point, "it's ... looking pretty bleak" for passage of a Glass-
Steagall bill in this Congress, said James McLaughlin, director of agency
relations for the American Bankers Association. "Most people ... think it
is already dead, but there is always a slim possibility, at least for the
first few months of the year," that the House will pass a bill in time for
the Senate to act, he said.
    Even if the House passes a bill, any debate in the Senate promises to
be contentious, as would be efforts to reconcile differing House and Senate
versions of the measure, McLaughlin and other lobbyists said.
    Legislation sponsored by Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., would allow affiliations not only between commercial banks
and securities firms, but also insurance companies and industrial
companies. This approach raises major policy issues, such as whether to
allow companies like General Motors into the banking and brokerage
businesses, McLaughlin said.
    D'Amato has said he will not act on his legislation until the House
takes action, a Senate Banking Committee spokesman said.
    D'Amato has made clear he does not want to repeat what occurred during
previous sessions of Congress, when the Senate three times passed a Glass-
Steagall reform bill, only to have it die in the House, lobbyists said.
However, election-year politics mean that Senate action cannot be ruled
out, even if the House fails to act, because senators may want to placate
financial services constituents who want reform, lobbyists said.
    House Banking Committee spokesman Dave Runkel maintained that the House
Glass-Steagall bill "is not dead" and that committee staff, led by Joseph
Seidel, are continuing to broker meetings with banking and insurance
industry representatives to reach a compromise.
    While the main sticking point is over insurance, the rest of the bill
affecting the ability of banks and securities firms to enter each other's
business "is pretty much intact," Runkel said.
    Wall Street and regional securities firms have differing interests and
concerns about letting commercial banks into their business, with regional
firms more opposed to competition from banks. The Securities Industry
Association has said it supports legislation that would put securities
firms on equal footing with banks and not subject the firms to more
burdensome banking regulation.
    The securities association has been supportive of banking interests on
the insurance dispute, because securities firms that want to enter
commercial banking do not want to be forced to divest insurance-related
businesses.
    But the securities group opposes letting banks directly underwrite
revenue bonds and other securities, and the association was a major force
in getting Leach to change the bill to require banks to engage in such
activity through separately capitalized units.
    But the requirement would discourage many of the couple of hundred
banks that now underwrite GO bonds from setting up separate units to sell
revenue bonds because of higher associated costs, McLaughlin said. Among
other things, the banks would have to set up firewalls between the
affiliate and the parent and other units, which would mean separate boards,
separate sales, no joint marketing, and other mechanisms aimed at
protecting federally insured deposits from the risks of investment banking.
    Roughly 30 banks now have affiliates engaged in so-called non-eligible
securities activities, such as revenue bond underwriting, under Section 20
of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Fed allows creation of such affiliates that
meet strict revenue limit, firewall, and other requirements.
    If Congress does not act this year, the Fed is expected to come under
pressure to ease these requirements for Section 20 affiliates, thus paving
the way for expanded bank securities activities. But the Fed probably would
act only in small incremental steps, and many banks still would be
discouraged from setting up Section 20 units because of costs, banking
lobbyists say.
    Fed regulations now limit revenues that can be derived from Section 20
securities activities to 10% of gross revenues. The Fed could "easily"
raise this cap to 25%, "if not higher," said Melanie Fein, a banking
attorney with Arnold & Porter.
    However, Gingrich said in a recent letter to Leach that he has no
intention of contacting the Fed to encourage such action. "I prefer passing
the Glass-Steagall bill in as close a consensus position as possible so
that Congress will ultimately make the policy determinations on these
important issues, and not regulators," he said.
    The Dec. 13 letter came as a follow-up to a meeting earlier in the
month among Gingrich, Leach, congressional staff, and representatives of
J.P. Morgan & Co., Banc One, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, and Bank
of America. Gingrich said the banking representatives appeared to have
misunderstood his answer to a question about Fed activity in this area.
    Meanwhile, a "pivotal event" for banks this year that could change the
whole face of the Glass-Steagall debate promises to be a U.S. Supreme Court
decision, which is expected by the end of June in Barnett Bank v. Tom
Gallagher, Insurance Commissioner, Fein said.
    The case, which is set for oral argument on Jan. 16, asks whether
national banks with branches in towns of less than 5,000 people have the
right to sell insurance in small towns, even if a state law prohibits any
such activity. The National Bank Act prohibits national banks from
underwriting insurance but contains a key exemption allowing such activity
in towns of up to 5,000.
    More than a dozen states have "anti-affiliation" laws like the Florida
law at issue in the case. These laws prohibit commercial banks from
encroaching on the business of insurance agents.
    If the high court rules that state law "trumps federal law in this
area, then banks would not be able to use the town of 5,000 exemption to
sell insurance," Fein said. "That would mean that banks would need to push
harder in Congress to gain legislative authority to sell insurance," she
said.
    If the court rules that the federal law preempts local law, banks would
have even less need than they do now for Glass-Steagall reform legislation,
Fein said. Much will depend on the decision, which could be limited in its
impact depending on how narrow it is, she said.

LOUISIANA GOVERNOR-ELECT: VOTERS NEED A VOICE ON GAMING

By Christopher McEntee
ATLANTA

     Louisiana Governor-elect Mike Foster says voters should
decide whether they want gambling, and plans to call a special session for
mid-March to get lawmakers' support for a referendum.
    A referendum would either uphold or throw out video poker, riverboat
gambling, and the New Orleans land-based casino that the state Legislature
made legal in a 1992 act.
    Foster, who takes office Jan. 8, feels that gambling was "rammed down
the people's throat" without a referendum, said Marsanne Golsby, Foster's
press secretary. Moreover, public opinion has soured on gambling because of
federal probes of several state lawmakers' connections with the gaming
industry and poor revenue growth from gaming.
    Rather than allowing separate votes for each form of gaming, Foster
will request an "all-or-nothing" vote, Golsby said.
    Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, Louisiana will have
gambling for the foreseeable future. The state has existing contracts or
licenses with a number of operators that would not be affected by the vote,
Golsby said. Gambling would have to be phased out as licenses and contracts
expire.
    In the some cases, such as video poker, the state grants a one-year
license annually, so these machines could be shut down almost immediately
if voters reject gaming. But the state's 12 riverboats would stick around
longer because they were given five-year contracts that start to run out in
1998.
    But New Orleans voters could have to wait until Harrah's Jazz Co.'s 30-
year contract runs out before they see a land-based casino leave their
city. That is unless that contract was broken when Harrah's Jazz, the
partnership developing the casino, filed for voluntary bankruptcy
protection on Nov. 22.
    Foster and his aides are working closely with Harrah's Jazz, Golsby
said, to figure out what the company intends to do about its finances and
its plans to build what they claimed would be the world's largest casino.
The partnership has until mid-March to present a reorganization plan in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
    But Golsby said Foster is reluctant to comment about Harrah's plans,
other than saying the state will review its proposals when it comes to
revenue-sharing agreements.
    For its part, Harrah's Jazz says it wants to push ahead with casino
building, yet Louisiana must cut red tape associated with the project and
allow it to reduce capital and fixed costs in its operating contract.
    Harrah's Entertainment vice president Colin V. Reed said last month
three changes must be made to its contract before a casino can be
"successful in a market that has substantially less" demand for gambling
than first imagined.
    First, the casino would scale back the number of slot machines and
games. Secondly, Harrah's Jazz would ask its bondholders to become equity
partners in the operation while it attempts to secure more cash.
    Lastly, Harrah's Jazz said the state must be more "flexible" about
receiving the $100 million minimum annual tax Harrah's Jazz is committed to
paying. The tax is the single largest fixed cost in the project.
    Reed suggested that the state should take $125 million, which has
already been paid, and use that money as an advance on the tax until the
permanent casino is in business. He claimed that the deferral of taxes
would be acceptable under state law because the casino would not be able to
make its minimum payments otherwise.
    Under their plan, the state expected to receive the greater of 18.5% of
gaming revenues or a $100 million flat tax from its sole New Orleans
casino, operated by Harrah's Jazz. To date, the state has received only $13
million from a temporary casino set up in advance of the permanent Harrah's
facility.
    State budget officials estimate that riverboats and video poker will
generate about $375 million in tax revenue throughout Louisiana in fiscal
1996.
    If they intend to repeal gaming laws, state lawmakers must approve a
constitutional amendment by a two-thirds vote and ask that voters take up
the issue. If legislators approve an amendment in mid-March, it could go
before the public 45 days later at the earliest, or be placed on the ballot
in November.

ENDING WITH A BANG, 1995 VOLUME SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS

By Yong Lim

    Suprising market observers, December was the fifth straight month in
which municipal bond issuance beat 1994 levels, according to figures
compiled from Securities Data Co.
    However, 1994 still stays slightly ahead of 1995 for overall long-term
new-issue volume.
    State and local governments sold 818 issues totaling $16.76 billion in
December, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in December
1994. This follows June and November of 1995, with $18.4 billion and $17.99
billion, respectively, as the third biggest month of new-issue volume.
    In 1995, bond sales totaled $156.22 billion, 5% below the $164.5
billion sold in 1994.
    Refunding issues rose a staggering 273% in December, to $3.86 billion
from $1.04 billion in December 1994, while issues that combined new-money
and refunding bonds rose nearly twelve-fold in December, to $1.69 billion
from $131 million.
    New-money issuance ended 1995 at $111.15 billion, 3% below 1994's
figure of $114.31 billion. Refundings for the year were $32.94 billion,
down 15% from $38.91 billion, while combined issues totaled $12.13 billion,
up 8% from $11.28 billion.
    Transportation, education, and housing were the only specific purposes
to show increases in bond sales from 1994. Transportation issues were up a
solid 13% in 1995, to $16.78 billion from $14.82 billion. Education issues
had a small 8% increase to $32.06 billion from $29.6 billion in 1994.
Housing increased a slight 2% to $16.16 billion from $15.86 billion in
1994.
    Public facilities, which covers libraries, stadiums, and fire stations,
suffered the greatest percentage drop from 1994, falling a hefty 32% to
$5.68 billion from $8.37 billion. The largest category, general purpose,
posted a 5% decline in 1995, to $39.37 billion from $41.57 billion.
Declines in other purpose categories ranged from a scant 4% dip for
utilities to a large 28% decline for environmental facilities.
    New issues subject to the alternative minimum tax for individuals
remained slightly above 1994 levels, rising 7%, to $17.95 billion from
$16.86 billion. Taxable municipal bond sales posted a 13% rise, to $9.53
billion from $8.45 billion.
    Bonds sold through negotiation rose a meek 0.3% in 1995, to $112.63
billion from $112.25 billion in 1994. Competitively sold issues declined a
solid 17%, to $40.85 billion from $49.47 billion.
    Revenue bond financing fell 11% in 1995, to $96.73 billion from $108.71
billion in 1994. General obligation issuance, however, rose a modest 7%, to
$59.49 billion from $55.79 billion.
    Variable-rate securities rose 5% in 1995, to $19.16 billion from $18.32
billion. The sale of convertible municipal bonds, which are zero-coupon
bonds that can be converted into current-coupon securities, have
quadrupled, to $296.5 million from just $69.3 million in 1994.
    The use of bond insurance to enhance new municipal issues increased 11%
in 1995, to $68.08 billion from $61.31 billion.
    Bank letters of credit declined 19% in 1995, to $9.91 billion from
$12.16 billion in 1994, while the use of collateralized mortgages and
mortgage insurance fell 21%, to $3.72 billion from $4.72 billion.
    California issuers were the busiest among the 50 states in 1995,
selling $20.14 billion. That was down 21% from $25.62 billion in 1994. New
York was second with $18.73 billion, down 1%, followed by Texas with $10.47
billion, up 1%; Florida with $9.05 billion, up a strong 18%; and
Pennsylvania with $7.15 billion, down 19%. Only 26 states and one U.S.
territory reported higher new-issue volume in 1995. North Dakota reported
the highest increase, doubling its 1994 volume of $241 million to $547
million in 1995. Delaware had the biggest decrease in volume, cutting in
half its 1994 figure of $364 million to $163 million in 1995.
    Bond issuance dropped more strongly at the state level than at the
local level in 1995. Cities, villages, towns, counties, local districts,
and local authorities showed a combined 2% drop in 1995, to $91.25 billion
from $93.4 billion. At the same time, state governments and agencies posted
a combined 9% decline, to $62.49 billion from $68.38 billion.
    Securities Data's volume figures are based on long-term bonds with
final maturities of 13 months or more. Private placements are included, but
taxable bonds sold by private nonprofit organizations and remarketings of
variable-rate bonds are excluded. The figures are preliminary and subject
to revision.

CASH FLOWS BACK INTO MUTUAL FUNDS, BUT NOT EVERYONE GETS A SHARE

By Elizabeth Roy

    Cash flows into both national and single-state mutual funds edged into
positive territory in November, reaching $274.8 million and partly undoing
October's $509.4 million in losses, according to figures from the
Investment Company Institute.
    The gains were modest, however, and several mutual fund companies said
they had not seen their share. They blamed the growing appeal of retirement
investing, the stock market's stellar performance, and the delayed federal
budget for investors' lack of interest.
    According to the ICI, national funds saw inflows of $190.4 million in
November, compared to October's outflows of $284.2 million. With reinvested
dividends the figures were inflows of $528.9 million and $55.6 million,
respectively.
    State funds gained $84.4 million in November, compared to losses of
$225.5 million the previous month. With reinvested dividends, there were
inflows of $349.2 million and $40.3 million, respectively.
    Municipal money market funds also posted inflows in November, as in
October. Excluding reinvested dividends, the funds added $12.5 billion in
November, compared to $13.1 billion the previous month. Including
dividends, both months recorded $15.3 billion inflows.
    In its monthly report, Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. said
it sold just $300,000 net of all firms' tax-advantaged bond funds in
November, down from $35.6 million in October, with reinvested dividends
included.
    A drop in sales from $136.8 million in October to $104.5 million in
November accounted for the bulk of the shift, according to Schwab spokesman
Tom Taggart.
    At least part of the drop is seasonal, Taggart said.
    "Toward the end of the year, a lot of people tend to reshuffle their
portfolios," he said.
    In addition, Taggart said, the stock market's excellent performance has
led many investors to shift cash from bonds to equities in anticipation of
another great year for stocks.
    The growth of retirement investing has further sidelined municipals,
since those tax-deferred assets do not flow into tax-exempt funds, Taggart
said.
    Fidelity Management & Research Co. experienced net sales of $14 million
in November, including reinvested dividends, according to spokeswoman Teri
Kilduff.
    But as of Dec. 21, Fidelity's tax-free funds had experienced net
redemptions of $41 million - a development Kilduff blamed on investor
anxiety over the delayed federal budget.
    At Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., spokeswoman Marilyn Morrison said:
"Municipal bonds continue to be pretty stagnant."
    The largest outflows have come from the firm's national long-term fund,
while its intermediate fund has seen the lightest redemptions, Morrison
said.
    The firm attributes that pattern to investor perception that long-term
funds will suffer most in the event of major tax reform, she added.
    By contrast, USAA Investment Management Co. benefited from the net
sales trend identified by the ICI. Company president Michael Roth said the
firm's tax-free funds saw inflows of $41 million in November. Roth said
investors were attracted by the high yields reached by municipals due to
the market's rally and fear of tax reform.
    Smith Barney Inc. has also seen its share of gains, said executive vice
president Jessica Bibliowicz. December has emerged as the strongest month
of 1995 for its tax-free funds, which also posted gains in November, she
said.
    Investor confidence in portfolio manager Joe Deane is largely
responsible, according to Bibliowicz.
    "Being the number-one ranked fund doesn't hurt," she said.

CALIFORNIA DEBATES WHETHER TO LINK SCHOOL FUNDING TO BUILDING PRISONS

By Antonio A. Prado
LOS ANGELES

    Top California GOP lawmakers said they hope partisan
politics don't get in the way as they reconvene today in hopes of passing a
resolution by next Monday to place a $3 billion state school general
obligation bond issue on the March 26 primary election ballot.
    Last year's legislative session ended in September with Republicans and
Democrats deadlocked over GOP insistence that school bonds be linked to a
prison bond initiative.
    That stalemate must be broken within the next few days, or the measures
will have to wait until November for the next opportunity to appear on a
statewide ballot, according to California Secretary of State Bill Jones.
    However, the same stumbling blocks that tripped up the bill in
September are still in place. While both sides agree on the need for school
construction funding, a Republican bill to be introduced today by
Assemblyman Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, nonetheless includes a $1.9
billion GO bond measure for new prison construction.
    "We have a need for school construction, and a need for prison
construction, and Republicans will propose a bill in the early part of the
session to do both," Brulte said in a press statement.
    The Democratic school bond proposal does not include the prison bond
provisions. Both measures require two-thirds majority approval in the
Assembly and state Senate for passage.
    "The Republican approach is still to hold the schools hostage to
building prisons," said Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Los Angeles, who last
month succeeded San Francisco Mayor-elect Willie L. Brown Jr. as the lower
house's top Democrat.
    "The Democratic view is (that) we need to build public schools to
reduce class size," Katz said. "And after we deal with schools, then we'll
deal with prisons."
    Aides to Brulte and Katz would not speculate on whether either side
would budge and allow a compromise.
    When the Legislature reconvenes today, the raucous Assembly will return
to a divided house and probable battles over its leadership.
    With Brown's departure on Dec. 14 following his election as San
Francisco mayor, the Assembly was left with 41 Republicans, 37 Democrats,
one Reform Party member, and one vacancy.
    The GOP will probably try to install Orange County assemblyman and
party leader Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, into the speakership, ousting
Brian Setencich, R-Fresno. Republicans are wary of Setencich because he was
elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic vote.
    And while the more docile state Senate has 21 Democrats holding a
simple majority control - with 16 Republicans, two independents, and one
vacancy - Brulte's bond bill probably won't gain the 27 votes needed to
pass even that less partisan body.
    Senate president pro tempore Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, said he opposes
any linkage of school bonds to prisons, adding through an aide that his
party caucus wants to curb what he called the "reckless spending" that has
made California's prisons among the most expensive in the nation.
    Meanwhile, education groups are urging lawmakers to cast politics aside
and place school GO bonds on the March ballot.
    The state Department of Finance has estimated that California's school
capital project needs at least $7 billion to refurbish aging facilities and
build new schools to handle statewide enrollments estimated at 140,000 new
students annually.
    "If California's financial situation were more dire, I could understand
my colleagues' concerns," said longtime Assemblywoman Dede Alpert, D-La
Jolla, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, and among those
opposed to linking school and prison bonds. "But our classrooms are the
most overcrowded in the nation."
    She added that while California's debt levels are up, they are moderate
compared to some states.

N.Y.C. ECONOMIC AGENCY POSTS ANOTHER BANNER YEAR

By Christina Pretto

     Increased business confidence in the local economy helped to make 1995
another record year for the bonding arm of the New York City Economic
Development Corp.
    In one fell swoop last year, the city's Industrial Development Agency
used up its entire annual allotment of private-activity bond volume - $120
million - to help finance a recycling plant on Staten Island for Pratt
Industries, an Australian company.
    That deal and others, including some scheduled to close this week,
brings the agency's total issuance for the year to more than $864 million,
just $7 million less than 1994's $871 million. Going forward, development
agency officials expect 1996 issuance levels to resemble those in 1995.
    The agency is able to exceed its annual allotment of private-activity
bonds by using allocations built up in previous years and by applying for
extra capacity from state private-activity reserves.
    In 1995, the agency completed 39 transactions that ranged in size from
$253 million to $1.3 million. In 1994, the agency completed 24
transactions.
    The numbers run in sharp contrast to issuance levels between 1987 and
1993. The most bonds issued in the period was $417 million of debt in 1991.
A more typical year was 1987, when the agency issued about $44 million of
debt.
    Corporation officials attribute the increase largely to a greater
confidence in the economy on the part of small businesses and nonprofits,
which has made the businesses more willing to take on long-term debt.
Better marketing of the agency's programs has also increased demand, they
said.
    Indeed, corporation president Charles Millard said he would like more
businesses and nonprofits - especially smaller ones - to take advantage of
the Development Agency's ability to issue tax-exempt bonds to raise
capital. Such financing is viewed by city officials as an investment tool
to revive the city's weak economy.
    The Industrial Development Agency is a subsidiary of the Economic
Development Corp., a public-benefit, quasi-governmental entity that is
charged with improving the city's business climate.
    The Development Agency - among other programs - issues revenue bonds
for both businesses and nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations needing funds for
capital investment.
    Both the corporation and the Development Agency have been at the
forefront of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to retain and attract
business - and thus jobs and tax revenues, crucial to a city that in the
last five years has lost more than 400,000 jobs while battling to close
chronic multibillion-dollar budget gaps.
    The issue for Pratt Industries is a key transaction in Giuliani's
agenda to bring in new business. The agency plans to sell another $150
million of debt for Pratt in 1996.
    The agency also recently sold about $253 million of bonds to finance a
co-generation plant for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a transaction that was
begun nearly four years ago. Together, the two projects are expected to
generate more than 800 jobs.
    But the agency is not focused solely on large deals - quite the
opposite. The lion's share of its issues over the past two years have been
less than $10 million, and have targeted smaller businesses and nonprofits,
such as a $1.3 million issue for the Dance Theater Workshop, a Manhattan
dance group.
    "I want more not-for-profits and small businesses to know we're
available," Millard said in a telephone interview. "If they can get access
to capital, then they can have an opportunity to grow."
    Many of the smaller issues are unrated and privately placed with funds
that are familiar with agency programs and need to diversify their
portfolios with small blocks of debt that are still triple- or double-tax-
exempt. The bonds are rarely traded and instead are held to maturity.
    To facilitate many of the agency's debt transactions, the corporation
must first acquire a title interest in a client's property. Such
acquisition creates a public interest in the business and legally justifies
the issuance of tax-exempt bonds.
    Issuance is also subject to allocation of New York State's allotment of
private-activity bond capacity. Of the state's $900 million annual private-
activity capacity, the city's Development Agency receives $120 million a
year.
    The agency may also apply for reserve allocation, which the state sets
aside every year, totaling $300 million. Both state and local agencies may
draw from the reserve on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the
state Economic Development Department, headed by Charles Gargano.

S&P SAYS UPGRADE FOR N.Y. WILL COME WITH BUDGET BALANCE

By Christina Pretto

    Standard & Poor's Corp. last week said New York State is in line for an
upgrade to A from A-minus if Republican Gov. George Pataki succeeds in
pushing through plans to cut spending and impose structural balance for the
fiscal 1997 budget.
    However, the rating agency warned that an upgrade to above the A-level
is years away because the state has yet to demonstrate a commitment to
fiscal responsibility over an extended period.
    Market reaction to the statement was virtually nil, as holiday doldrums
kept trading activity low, several traders said.
    "New York paper is pretty stretched as it is," one trader said. "I
think everybody is into a holiday mode."
    Nonetheless, market participants have been grumbling over the past few
months that the state - the lowest rated in the country by Standard &
Poor's - is due for an upgrade as it embarks on a path of tax cuts coupled
with spending reductions.
    The upgrade to A - if it happens - will occur in or around March.
Richard Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's, said in an interview last
week that the positive outlook on the rating would be removed at around
that time.
    "We're going to make a determination as to whether the rating is A or
A-minus in March," Marino said. "At that point we'll take the positive
outlook off the rating and replace it with a stable outlook."
    An upgrade to A will hinge on the state's enacting a structurally
balanced budget that reduces general-fund spending, like that currently
being proposed by Pataki, Marino said.
    Whether that happens, however, is subject to significant risk,
including legislative opposition to cuts in social service spending and
uncertainty surrounding changes in federal funding for entitlement
programs, Marino added.
    Moody's Investors Service already rates New York State's general
obligation bonds A.
    Overall, Standard & Poor's praised Pataki's proposed $63.3 billion all-
funds budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 - particularly the
administration's effort to introduce the plan a month ahead of schedule.
    "This was an extremely difficult task given the uncertainty surrounding
the federal budget," the rating agency said in a statement.
    The plan also calls for reducing state general-fund spending for the
second straight year, moving budgeting to a cash basis, and balancing tax
cuts with cuts in spending, particularly in Medicaid.
    Separate but related budget initiatives include a proposal by Pataki
that both the executive and legislative branches agree on one set of
revenue estimates for budget deliberations, which rating analysts said
would be a step in the right direction.
    "Any serious movement ... to this method of revenue forecasting would
be viewed positively," Standard & Poor's said.
    Currently, the two parties constantly haggle over revenue estimates,
which are often revised upward simply to accommodate an unwillingness to
reduce spending. As a result, deficits are exacerbated, credit analysts
said.
    The governor has also proposed constitutional amendments to require:
the Legislature to enact a balanced budget; the governor to propose the
executive budget by Dec. 1; and the enactment of an austerity budget when
the budget is passed late, rather than the use of emergency appropriations.
    "While these initiatives are very long-term in nature ... if carried
through, (they) could position New York to have a credit rating more in
line with other states in the country," the rating agency said.
    But the state must do a few other things to garner an above-A rating,
Marino said, suggesting an elimination - or significant drawdown - of the
state's $4 billion accumulated deficit, and years of on-time budget
enactments.
    "An above-A level wouldn't happen before the end of the century,"
Marino said. "We're looking for long-term actions."
    But some market observers argue that the Pataki administration's
willingness to fight for spending reductions and tax cuts deserves
significant recognition from the rating agencies.
    "It's ridiculous. We're below West Virginia and Louisiana," said one
analyst. "Come on."

AS FEDERAL AID GAP SQUEEZES N.J., STATE SELLS TRANS EARLY

By David Kaplan

     The impasse over fiscal 1996 federal appropriations bills has forced
New Jersey to accelerate short-term debt issuance as delays in federal
payments for Medicaid and other programs cause cash-flow problems.
    While a number of states have the resources to make up for the overdue
aid from Washington, a prolonged stalemate between Congress and the
president could put other states in the same fix as New Jersey, said Hyman
C. Grossman, a managing director for Standard & Poor's Corp.
    With no agreements on appropriations for federal departments governing
Medicaid, Medicare, welfare, or job training - the most significant
programs sending money to the states - many states have been spending their
own funds on those programs since the federal fiscal year began Oct. 1.
    Yesterday, New Jersey completed the second - and final, according to
state Treasury officials - installment of a $505 million short-term cash-
flow borrowing authorization by issuing a $250 million commercial paper tax
and revenue anticipation note.
    The issue was rated A1-plus by Standard & Poor's and Prime-1 by Moody's
Investors Service. A line of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland ensured
adequate liquidity for the commercial paper program, and helped secure the
high ratings, rating agency analysts said.
    On Dec. 5, New Jersey issued $200 million in commercial paper Trans as
a result of the cash-flow pressure caused by delay in aid from Washington,
state officials said.
    A spokeswoman for the state treasurer said that while the state is
permitted to borrow $505 million, the $450 million in commercial paper
Trans should cover for the absence of federal assistance.
    Of the programs that receive federal aid, New Jersey's Human Services
Department faces the greatest potential for disruption, Grossman noted.
Most of the proceeds from the commercial paper will go to human services.
    "Different states are handling effects of the budget impasse in
different ways," Grossman said. "Most states are handling the cash-flow
problems internally. They can move money around - apparently with less
difficulty than New Jersey. But some states have legal restrictions on the
ability to borrow internally."
    Florida is one state that has been able to successfully transfer money
within its borders to cover the delayed federal aid, Grossman said.
    "In effect, what Florida has done is advance money to service providers
that ordinarily would have been paid from federal money," Grossman said.
"When and if the federal budget gets straightened out, federal money will
flow down to Tallahassee and then the state will reimburse from whence they
borrowed."
    New Jersey doesn't have constraints that prevent borrowing internally,
Grossman said. But state officials probably concluded that it was less
costly to issue debt than to shift money around internally, he said.
    "When you borrow internally, you have to pay a taxable rate," Grossman
said. "It's cheaper to go out and issue tax-exempt commercial paper."
    The commercial paper Trans should cover the state's liquidity for at
least six weeks, said David Alter, an assistant vice president with
Moody's.
    "It should be said that the state has adequate reserves to maintain the
difference from that shortfall," Alter added. "The month-ending balance for
January is sufficient even without the cash-flow borrowing. It's to
preserve proper liquidity, because at some point in January, the state
would normally experience a low point anyway. This borrowing is a little
more than usual, but they expected to do it anyway."
    At this point in time, both Grossman and Alter said that no other
states have accelerated their issuance as a result of the federal
government shutdown. But they do expect other states to follow suit if the
impasse lasts through January.
    On Dec. 22, Congress passed a continuing spending resolution that will
expire midnight Jan. 3. The programs operating under that resolution are
Aid to Families With Dependent Children, veterans benefits, and the budget
for the District of Colombia.
    "Of course, this is America and this thing will get resolved at some
point and by the time February rolls around, cash-flow estimates show a
large bump up in revenues," Alter said. "So while the situation is
difficult for New Jersey, it is by no means desperate."

GOLDMAN BACK AT TOP OF THE HEAP; ISSUANCE HEALTHIER THAN EXPECTED

By Yong Lim

    Goldman, Sachs & Co. won the top municipal underwriting spot in 1995,
knocking Merrill Lynch & Co. out of the number one senior manager position,
according to figures compiled from Securities Data Co.'s database.
    Merrill, top lead manager in 1993 and 1994, dropped to second position
for that category but took the top honor among co-managers.
    The figures also show long-term bond sales totaled $156.22 billion in
1995, helped by a strong close to the year. The figure was higher than most
market observers had expected but still 5% below the $164.5 billion sold in
1994, according to Securities Data.
    In December, state and local governments sold 818 issues totaling
$16.76 billion, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in
December 1994, Securities Data said. Private placements are included in all
volume figures but not the underwriting rankings. (See article on page 3.)
    Last year Goldman Sachs lead managed 307 issues, totaling $19.83
billion. That accounted for 12.8% of the $154.94 billion of long-term bonds
sold through negotiated and competitive underwriting during the period.
    Merrill Lynch lead managed $17 billion in 1995, followed by Smith
Barney Inc. with $12.98 billion, PaineWebber Inc. with $12.71 billion, and
Lehman Brothers with $9.83 billion.
    Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been in a dogfight for the top of
the municipal underwriting rankings since 1987. Merrill, which last won the
crown in 1994, has won five out of the last nine years. But Goldman easily
prevailed in 1995, not only taking first place for the year as a whole but
also grabbing each quarter's top honors.
    In co-manager rankings, where each manager in an issue is given credit
for the full par value of the sale, Merrill Lynch led in long-term bond
sales, with 779 issues totaling $45.9 billion, followed closely by Smith
Barney with $44.88 billion.
    After them came Goldman Sachs with $44.57 billion, PaineWebber with
$41.63 billion, and Lehman Brothers with $35.61 billion. Merrill last won
the co-manager rankings in 1989. PaineWebber has dominated from 1990 to
1994 as top co-manager in municipal underwriting.
    By a large margin, New York City was the leading issuer of long-term
bonds in 1995, with 14 issues totaling $5.42 billion. It was the biggest
seller of debt from 1991 to 1993, but was eclipsed by the state of
California 1994.

Transportation Corridor, Calif., with $1.51 billion.
    California fell from first in 1994 to ninth place with $1.25 billion.
    Except for the second quarter, where Foothill/Eastern was the top
issuer, New York City led every quarter in 1995.

SAYING GOODBYE TO 1995, PLAYERS HOPE FOR QUICK PRIMARY PICKUP

By Michael Stanton

    After a week of solid gains despite light post-holiday volume,
municipal market players say they are looking forward to a rise in activity
this week to validate prices' climb.
    Last week's almost dormant primary market is expected to be replaced by
a more active new-issue sector starting tomorrow, but although the calendar
is heavier, several underwriters noted that many of the deals planned for
this week are refundings whose ultimate timing will rely on the market's
performance.
    Leading that list is an insured $155 million electric system revenue
refunding issue for Sikeston, Mo., that is scheduled to be priced in the
negotiated sector by lead manager A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.
    An underwriter at the firm said the deal - originally planned for late
December before the market deteriorated under the weight of a supply surge
- has returned to the calendar for next week, but could be delayed again.
    "We put it on the calendar, but the market's going to have to tell us
when it's going to be priced," the underwriter said.
    Other significant deals on the negotiated calendar for this week
include an $89.3 million general obligation public improvement refunding
bond issue for Richmond that is set to be priced by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    Meanwhile, Smith Barney Inc., as senior manager, plans to price a $66.4
million sales tax revenue refunding issue for the Riverside County, Calif.,
Transportation Commission. The deal is set to be insured by Financial
Guaranty Insurance Co.
    In other negotiated action, Goldman Sachs will return to the market as
senior manager for a $65 million hospital revenue refunding issue for
Integris Health Systems in Oklahoma. The deal is set to be sold with
insurance from AMBAC Indemnity Corp.
    The competitive sector, meanwhile, will gear up for a $127 million
refunding from Clark County, Nev., on Thursday, while a long-awaited $183.9
million Florida Board of Education refunding remains on 24-hour notice.
    In Thursday's secondary market activity, traders said municipal prices
were unchanged to up #1/4 of a point in light trading, with what demand
there was coming from other dealers, while major buy-side participants
moved into a "holiday mode" ahead of Friday's early close and the long
weekend for New Year's Day.
    Although traders uniformly cautioned that the week's gains were based
on very thin trading activity, most said the slow primary market supply and
light forward calendar, lent the market a firm tone going into the new
year.
    "The primary's not going to be dead like it was this week, but it's
still going to be relatively quiet, so from the supply side of things, I
think we still have a good tone," another trader said.
    The Bond Buyer's 30-day visible supply of new issues expected to come
to market within the next month totaled $2.29 billion Thursday, up $141.4
million from Wednesday. That comprised $1.06 billion of competitive issues,
up $141.4 million, and $1.23 billion of negotiated issues, which was
unchanged.
    Standard & Poor's Blue List of dealer inventories fell $119.9 million,
to $1.44 billion.
    With the impasse over the federal budget causing a suspension in data
releases from the Commerce Department and Bureau of Labor Statistics,
fixed-income players were forced to turn to several privately compiled
sources for insight into the economy's health.
    Although data on the number of initial unemployment claims for the week
of Dec. 18 was delayed, the Conference Board reported that its index of
help-wanted advertising volume fell four points to 127 in November, which
is considered to reflect a drop in the supply of jobs and a slowing
economy.
    The signs of economic weakness helped government market traders sustain
their week-long rally, pushing the 30-year Treasury bond through the 6%
psychological barrier, where it stayed for the remainder of the session.
Late Thursday, the long bond was quoted up #12/32, to yield 5.98%.
    But both the Treasury and municipal markets' attention remained focused
on Washington, with players voicing hopes that the stress of the government
shutdown, along with the rapidly approaching presidential primary season,
would lead to a quick agreement between White House and congressional
leaders to balance the budget.
    The debt futures markets moved up in line with the cash markets'
bearish tone, although the municipal futures contract continued to
underperform the Treasury contract. The March municipal contract closed up
#9/32 Thursday, to 120#23/32.
    But the MOB spread widened again, and was calculated at negative 13
Thursday, compared with negative nine Wednesday.
