COURT REQUIRES LIST OWNER TO OFFER 'OPT-OUT'

Over the past decade, many large mailing houses have adopted
a voluntary "opt-out" policy, permitting persons on a
mailing list to have their names deleted before the list is
rented to other mailers.

Now, for the first time, "opt-out" has been imposed on a
mailer as a matter of law.

The order, from a federal bankruptcy judge in San Antonio,
Tex., arose in unique circumstances.  One of the remaining
assets of a company that filed for bankruptcy was its
mailing list.  The company, Shocking Gray Corp., published a
catalog for gay consumers, many of whom expected that their
names on the list would remain confidential.

At a court-supervised auction to sell off the customer list,
some vendors of sex-related products made bids.  Further,
there was no assurance that whatever company purchased the
list would keep it discreet.

One of the bidders at auction and the leading marketer of
gay products by mail, Sean Strub, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Ronald P. King that if the list fell into the wrong hands it
would deter many gay consumers from letting their names
become part of marketing lists.  He urged the court to order
the buyer to give everyone on the list an opportunity to get
off of it.

The lawyer for the bankrupt company argued that giving
persons on the list the opportunity to be removed would
diminish its value.  "My job is to generate as much cash as
possible," he said.  But the judge ordered the company with
the winning bid at auction, Tzabaco in Northern California,
to offer everybody on the list an opt-out option.  David
Dow, Tzabaco's president,  said that his company, which
sells clothing and furniture by catalog, would have done
this anyway, because it knows the sensitivity of its gay
clientele.  About 15,000 of the 200,000 persons on the list
(7.5 percent) exercised the option.

Lawyers for Shocking Gray said afterwards that this order
exceeded the judge's authority.  But, bankruptcy courts have
wide latitude in managing the disposition of a company's
assets, including attaching conditions to purchases.  95-
52856-RPK (W.D. Tex., U.S. Bankruptcy Ct., Nov. 14).

VARNEY OF TRADE COMMISSION TO THE FOREFRONT

Leadership on the privacy issue in Washington has been
handed around over the past two decades depending on which
persons in high places take an interest.

The Office of Consumer Affairs and the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration have had a
piece of it.  Now it seems to be the Federal Trade
Commission's turn, in the person of its commissioner,
Christine A. Varney.

Not only has the FTC stepped up its compliance activity in
regulating credit bureaus and telemarketing, it has begun a
"Privacy Initiative" involving other agencies of the federal
government and state consumer-protection offices "to begin
to incorporate [privacy] principles in our consumer
protection mission," according to Varney.  After a series of
hearings last fall, the FTC plans a public workshop  this
spring (for information contact Martha Landesberg, e-mail
mlandesberg(at)ftc.gov).

The Bureau of Consumer Protection has been assigned to
gather comments from consumers, businesses, and privacy
organizations.  At the same time, the FTC established a
World Wide Web on-line site (ftc.gov) "to facilitate
thoughtful electronic debate about the rules that should
apply in the use and dissemination of consumer information
on-line," according to Varney, who was chief counsel to
President Clinton's 1992 campaign then cabinet secretary
before being named an FTC commissioner in 1994.  "An
important goal of the FTC's Privacy Initiative is to avoid
cumbersome regulation by facilitating the development of a
set of voluntary principles to govern the use of consumer
information in on-line transactions," Varney told a privacy
conference last fall.  This echoes the mantra of President
Bush's Consumer Advisor, Bonnie Guiton, who proved that "the
bully pulpit" of a federal office can prod businesses even
in the absence of laws.

QUOTABLE

"It combines casualness of speech with the permanence of
writing.  It's got a lot of potential for embarrassing the
other side," says Hartford, Conn., lawyer Allan B. Taylor,
explaining why lawyers like to pour over electronic mail for
evidence, quoted by CONNECTICUT LAW TRIBUNE, Dec. 18, 1995.

'BOSTON GROUP' HOLDS UP MEDICAL PRIVACY BILL

A band of medical privacy critics in Boston has succeeded in
stalling a Senate bill that they believe "undercuts the very
fabric of doctor-patient confidentiality."

The bill introduced last November with bipartisan, liberal
and conservative sponsors and the blessing of Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole seemed assured of quick passage
in the Senate.  In fact, the main sponsor of S 1360, Sen.
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, planned to rush it though the chamber
before Christmas, after a cursory day of hearings Nov. 14.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had signed on
on as a sponsor in expectation that the American Civil
Liberties Union would endorse the bill.  Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., signed on assuming that the confidentiality bill was
endorsed by privacy advocates.

Janlori Goldman, a former ACLU staff member who as deputy
director of the industry-funded Center for Democracy and
Technology aided in the drafting and the industry response
to the bill, led Senate staff to believe that the
legislation was supported by privacy and patient
organizations.

But a tiny organization of patients and practitioners called
the Coalition for Patient Rights spotted weaknesses in the
proposal.  Its New England representative, Massachusetts
psychiatrist Denise Nagel, persuaded the ACLU affiliate in
Massachusetts to oppose the bill.  She activated a few
privacy advocates in Washington, notably James Love of the
Ralph Nader-founded Consumers Project on Technology and Marc
Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who
oppose the current draft.

The ACLU in Boston demanded a showdown with its national
leadership and persuaded it to reverse its neutral or
favorable stance towards the bill.

Perhaps in response, Goldman's organization and the American
Health Information Management Association (a trade group of
hospital records administrators) organized weekly strategy
sessions in Washington beginning before Christmas and
extending into late February.  Nagel, Rotenberg, and Love
have been a part of these meetings.  At the same time, on
the first working day of the New Year in Boston, Nagel
convened an impressive coalition of medical confidentiality
advocates who are preparing an amended version of the
Bennett bill and a totally new substitute to offer Congress
by next month.

The attendees included Love, Rotenberg, PRIVACY JOURNAL
Publisher Robert Ellis Smith, and representatives of the
Health Law Institute in Boston, the national and local ACLU,
the Council for Responsible Genetics, and the American
Psychiatric Association.

In the meeting, CPR, CRG, and CPT were criticizing a bill
and strategy embraced by CDT.  One had to stay alert.

(Smith has been quoted by COMPUTERWORLD as saying, "The bill
has three or four weaknesses that, if cured, would make it a
net plus for consumers.  Right now, it's a net minus, but it
doesn't miss by much.")

The Boston group thinks that the bill accelerates the
computerization and linkage of patient data and that it
permits wide access to law enforcement and insurance
companies, as well as to employees within a medical
facility.  The Center for Democracy and Technology says that
the Bennett bill is the strongest medical privacy proposal
ever seriously considered by Congress.

The dispute has accentuated a growing schism among privacy
groups  in Washington and, in the process, has stalled
consideration of S 1360 and caused some Senate liberals to
reconsider their endorsement of the current language.

The bill creates a new nationwide right for patients to
inspect their own files and a framework for patients to
consent to a wide variety of disclosures.  The bill
generally gives approval to current disclosures of medical
data.  If medical providers comply with the new law they
would be immune from lawsuits by patients victimized by
disclosure of their medical information.  The bill would
pre-empt stronger state laws in eight states, California,
Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts,  Minnesota,
Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

AUTOMATED MEDICAL FILES NOW LESS SECURE?

In 1994 52 percent of 355 hospital records managers
responding to a survey said that computerized records are
more secure than paper records.  In 1995, that percentage
slipped to 43 percent, the same number who think that manual
and automated records are about equally secure.  The Second
Annual Computer-Based Patient Records Survey by the Chicago
law firm of Gordon & Glickson, is available from Diana J.P.
McKenzie, 312/372-7671, fax 312/321-9324, e-mail

INTERNET WIRETAP, A FIRST

For the first time, federal prosecutors have used a wiretap
order from a federal court to intercept messages on the
Internet.

The investigation resulted in the arrests Dec. 29 of a
German engineer living in Nevada, his estranged wife, and a
salesman for the German man.  They were charged with an
international conspiracy to sell illegal electronic
surveillance equipment.

In the past, federal authorities have monitored Internet
activities with the consent of participants.  Federal agents
are also able to get identities of Internet users and stored
messages with a subpoena, but intercepting ongoing messages
requires a court-approved warrant.  In this case, Secret
Service agents in New York City secured approval to tap the
German's electronic-mail activity on CompuServe.  They posed
as buyers, in six months of electronic communication with
the suspect, Bernhard Bowitz.

JFK, NIXON, AND NOW -

A writer for SPY magazine was assigned to get a job at the
tabloid newspapers to learn whether the reports of tawdry
gossip-gathering techniques were true.  In an article
published in the November/December issue, Stuart Goldman
reported that the practices were worse than he had imagined.

"The tabloids are, as I would experience first-hand, in the
business of smearing reputations and subverting the truth.
If the blatant fabrication of stories - and the lying,
backstabbing, bribery, blackmail, intimidation, mail theft,
wiretapping, leaking of disinformation, and computer hacking
used to get these stories - wasn't what I initially
expected, I quickly learned otherwise," Goldman wrote in a
shocking expose, after stints working for THE NATIONAL
ENQUIRER, THE STAR, THE GLOBE, and "A  Current Affair" in
Los Angeles.

Hollywood now has its long awaited opportunity for revenge
against the gossip press.  A new company named Phoenix
Pictures has purchased the rights to Goldman's nine-page
story and signed Oliver Stone, who directed "JFK" and
"Nixon," to direct.  Goldman plans to recount more of his
experiences in a forthcoming book, SNITCH: CONFESSIONS OF A
TABLOID SPY,  COMPUTER HACKER AND ALL AROUND SCOUNDREL.

SO MUCH FOR PRINCIPLES

Since the 1980s, the principle of "secondary use" has been
the crucial part of a code of fair information practices
endorsed by the federal government and by hundreds of
businesses.  The principle states that personal information
gathered for one purpose ought not be used for an
incompatible purpose without the consent of the individual.

"The principle," says the Washington spokesman for the
direct-marketing business, Richard A. Barton, "was raised to
the status of Holy Writ."

In the early 1990s, TRW Information Systems abandoned the
principle in its revised code of practices (although its
competitor, Equifax, continues to endorse the principle, in
a code of standards revised in 1993).

Now, Barton says that the principle probably doesn't apply
to the direct marketing industry of the 1990s.  "The
Internet and other interactive services have different
protocols and privacy expectations than traditional forms of
direct marketing," he writes in an essay in DM News (Dec.
25, 1995).  "We now enjoy a greater ability to collect,
store, and organized data than was imaginable just 18 years
ago.  As well, security problems on the Internet have
increased people's privacy concerns.  We must examine
privacy issues with a fresh perspective.  If we do not, we
may not have as great a success in molding the regulatory
environment as we have had in the past."

This revisionism comes when the DMA's most influential
member, Metromail, a direct-marketing firm, has been
criticized for violating the principle on secondary use, by
selling information traditionally used for marketing to law
enforcement, private investigators, and skip tracers.
Metromail has a call-in service whereby anyone, for $3 a
minute, may learn the telephone numbers, names, and ages of
all residents at a known address [see PJ Dec 95].  The
company, a subsidiary of R.H. Donnelley & Sons, said that it
has discontinued including children's names in its service.

BUSTING PARENTS: IT CAN HAPPEN HERE

In a story on the arrest of a famous TV anchor person in
London for having apparently taken innocent nude photographs
of her seven-year-old daughter [see PJ Dec 95], PRIVACY
JOURNAL asked "Can it happen here?"

On the very day that ITN newsreader Julia Somerville was
arrested in a drug store that developed the photos, a woman
was subjected to the same humiliation and fear in Cambridge,
Mass.

Both arrests occurred on Nov. 2.  The case of Toni Marie
Angeli came to light only late in December, perhaps because
she is not famous.

Angeli said that she took pictures of her four-year-old boy
for a class at Harvard, where she is a graduate student.
The photos show the boy nude inside their apartment and
outdoors; in some shots he is urinating.

A photo lab alerted Cambridge police to the photos, and
detectives showed up at the lab to confront the mother when
she picked up the photos.  An argument and scuffle ensued,
and she was arrested for assault and disorderly conduct.  No
charge was issued concerning the photos because there was no
"lascivious intent."

Police said that they wanted to satisfy themselves that the
photos were taken by a parent, without coercion to the
child.

Opinion seemed split in Boston whether the police had
overreacted or whether they were right in checking out all
suspicions of child abuse.  "There is a moral panic afoot in
the U.S. that has been accelerating in recent years," said
the Boston Coalition for Freedom of Expression.  "If there
is no direct evidence of sexual abuse in the pictures, then
that should have been enough."

MARYLAND MEDICAL DATA BASE; RECYCLED MEDICAL DATA

FROM MIRIAM L. AZRAEL, ATTORNEY, BALTIMORE, MD.:  Thank you
for including in last month's issue information about
Maryland's medical records data base.  The day after I
received my issue in the mail I received a call from a
Bethesda, Md., subscriber who somehow tracked me down for
more information.  The more Marylanders who get involved in
the process, the more accountable the state will be to
consumers who have legitimate concerns about their medical
records privacy.

FROM SAN DIEGO, CAL.:  Our organization received a complaint
from a person who received a letter from a hospital saying
that "an employee retrieved some computer generated medical
sheets from a recycling box to use as scratch paper at home.
 . . . A friend of our employee inappropriately used several
of these sheets as stationery.  You have been identified as
one who received correspondence from that person on the back
of these medical records and are, therefore, in possession
of this health care information."  The hospital then
cautioned the recipient not to violate California's medical
confidentiality law by disclosing the information and
insisted that the "stationery" be returned to the hospital
immediately.

[In addition to the breach] we are concerned that the
hospital now has in its possession the personal
correspondence list of the [non-employee] individual who
used recycled paper as stationery.

FROM TRUMANSBURG, N.Y.:  I wrote to MIB Inc. and asked for a
copy of my file.  They sent me the form, I filled it out
(they didn't ask for a SSN, amazingly), and they wrote back
and said that they had no file on me at all.  I don't
believe them - I had [individual health] insurance in effect
about three years earlier and the insurance company had
added stuff to my application which they presumably got from
MIB.  Do I have any recourse?

RESPONSE: At present you have to take a consumer reporting
agency's word when it says it has no file on you.  But if
you discover in the future that it did have information on
you, you can take action, based on a violation of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act.

It is not surprising that MIB does not have a file on you.
It has records on only about five percent of the U.S.
population, mainly for life insurance underwriting.  MIB,
located in Boston (617/426-3660), keeps computerized
summaries taken from prior insurance applications and then
provides them to another insurance company to which you
apply for coverage.  It is an example of a huge data base
that does not use Social Security numbers in its files.

FROM MT. HOPE, ARK.:  What kind of background checks on
patients do doctors and dentists do?  How can I get access
to this data base?

RESPONSE:  There are a few data bases that will tell a
doctor whether a person has filed a malpractice lawsuit in
the past.  These entities are subject to the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, which requires them to disclose to you what
information they have stored on you and requires the doctor
to identify the data base if you are turned down as a
patient because of information in them.  (There  is also a
federal data base listing doctors accused of malpractice and
other misconduct, although it is not available to the
general public.  There are a few private data bases that
sell similar information to the public.  They are not
subject to the FCRA.)
