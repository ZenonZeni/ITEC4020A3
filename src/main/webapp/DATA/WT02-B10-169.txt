</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Myrna M. Weissman, Ph.D. received a grant from The Upjohn Company to test and refine a computer-driven system for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in primary care. The Genetic Epidemiology Core, part of the Center to Study Youth Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide (David Shaffer, M.D., Principal Investigator) was funded April 1994 through March 1999. The epidemiology component of the PPG Psychobiology/Genetics/Treatment of Anxiety Disorders (Donald Klein, M.D., Principal Investigator) was funded May 1994 through April 1999. Dr. Weissman has also received notification that her MERIT award to study the genetics of panic disorder will be renewed September 1995 through August 2000. Notification was also received of a grant from Bristol Myers Squibb to study access and barriers to treatment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three junior members of the department also received new funding.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Susan Wolk, M.D. received a two-year grant from the American Suicide Foundation to measure serotonin in adults with childhood onset Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and a Psychiatric Institute Research Scientist (PIRSG) pilot grant to study the continuity between childhood and adult depression, using biological measures.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ris&euml; Goldstein, Ph.D. received notification approving a two-year Aaron Diamond Fellowship beginning July 1995 to study predictors of substance abuse and barriers to treatment utilization in depressed children grown up.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<B>New Research Findings in Family and Genetic Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Genetic Studies of Panic Disorder</B>  Working with Conrad Gilliam, Ph.D., and James Knowles, M.D., Ph.D., the department has tested 23 families (367 individuals) with panic disorder for linkage to 587 genetic markers in order to positionally identify genetic factors involved in panic disorder (Vieland et al., 1994). This work includes a systematic genomic screen using a set of CA repeat markers with average spacing of 13 centimorgans (cM) on a subset of the 13 most informative pedigrees. Essentially, all the markers have been run and the data is now being analyzed. The department has also been collecting "triads" (father, mother, and proband) to perform genetic association studies of panic disorder with candidate disease genes. Currently, 32 independence triads have been collected and <BR>
an increase to 50 triads is expected in the first quarter of 1995. Using 17 triads, the <BR>
GABA-*-1 and GABA-*-3 genes have been tested for linkage disequilibrium to panic disorder. Both were not in disequilibrium to panic disorder.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Development of Data Management Methods</B>  Dr. Adams has continued to modify his family genetics tracking programs by adding the capability to manage best-estimate diagnoses across studies in order to accommodate unlimited lanes of data in addition to multiple families within a single gel/blot, to accept studies which include repeated measures. Security routines have been added, output modes now include SAS, BMDP, and SSPC formats, and the program will read from scanned data files. These programs are being adapted for use by investigators at the Medical College of Virginia, the University of Iowa, Trinity College (Dublin), Johns Hopkins University, the University of Alabama, Harvard University and the NIMH.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Mathematical Genetics</B>  Concerns about whether ascertainment correction is even required for large pedigrees, about whether and how multiple probands in the same pedigree can be taken into account properly, and about how to apply sequential sampling strategies have occupied many investigators in recent years. Susan Hodge, D.Sc., and Veronica Vieland, Ph.D. showed that the common practice of conditioning on the observed pedigree structure, when data have been sequentially obtained, is in general not correct, except when ascertainment is "single." Moreover, in a major step forward for genetic epidemiology, they proved that the problem is literally intractable (again, except for single ascertainment).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>The Genetic Phenomenon of "Anticipation"</B>  This study examines how one tests for anticipation, defined as an inheritance pattern wherein a disease is progressively more severe, or is more frequent, or occurs at earlier ages, in successive generations of affected individuals. Recently, anticipation has become a "hot topic" in psychiatric genetics, with several studies purporting to demonstrate its existence for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, etc. If true anticipation does exist, this would be an important finding, which would point the way to a true gene for the disease, a gene most likely involving trinucleotide repeats (TNR's). However, there are serious statistical problems involved in the search for anticipation, and most published studies have not taken these problems sufficiently into account. Our study demonstrates some of these problems and ends on a note of caution for researchers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Association Analysis</B>  This is another "hot topic" in psychiatric genetics. Everyone is doing association studies, but many researchers are misinterpreting their findings. Dr. Hodge wrote an editorial summarizing recent mathematical modelling findings concerning association analysis. Her summary was expressed in less technical language in order to be more accessible to psychiatric researchers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Genetic Analysis Workshop</B>  The Genetic Analysis Workshops are held every two years and represent an opportunity for genetic epidemiologists from all over the world to come together and work on two or three problems that have been set ahead of time. <BR>
Dr. Hodge was primarily responsible for developing and formulating these problems for the 1994 workshop.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>High Risk Studies and Longitudinal Studies</B>  An in-progress 15-year follow-up study of depressed, anxious, and normal children grown up has suggested the continuity between childhood and adult depression, with extremely high rates of suicide (4.4%) and suicide attempts (35%) in depressed children grown up. In addition to collection of longitudinal diagnostic information, biological studies are being conducted by Susan Wolk, M.D., and Jeremy Coplan, M.D., repeating and augmenting biological studies done during the initial treatment and study of these adolescents between 1978 and 1984. Preliminary findings suggest that non-suicidal MDD subjects may demonstrate nocturnal GH hypersecretion during adolescence as seen in prepubertal subjects with MDD. In contrast to the original reports, current studies indicate that adolescents with MDD and suicidal behavior at time of testing fail to show the increased GH secretion evident in their non-suicidal MDD counterparts irrespective of subsequent suicidal behavior.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies in children and adolescents have not found any consistent pattern of sleep changes associated with major depression. Goetz et.al. found no differences in REM sleep between the adolescent depressives and normal controls. Longitudinal follow-up has revealed that suicidality is an important variable in the sleep measures in both the prepubertal and adolescent cohort. Data indicates that the depressed children who were suicidal at the time of the original testing demonstrate significantly increased REM density during their first REM period compared to depressed children who were not suicidal at the time of the testing and to normal control children. No differences in REM latency were identified between the depressed and normal adolescents.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Offspring of Depressed Parents</B>  A 10-year follow-up study of children at high risk for depression showed a high rate of recurrent depression and low prevalence of treatment even though these families come from clinics in which they or their parents received intensive treatment for their depression. Women had higher rates of untreated psychopathology than men, which goes against the help-seeking patterns normally observed. Further analysis is being done by Virginia Warner, M.P.H., Priya Wickramaratne, Ph.D., and Mark Olfson, M.D., to determine factors presenting barriers to treatment-seeking by these women.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Also, data show that offspring of depressed parents showed higher rates of MDD and anxiety disorders compared to children of non-depressed parents. Offspring of depressed parents also showed significantly higher rates of alcohol dependency, a trend towards higher rates of any anxiety disorder, and higher rates of drug dependency. There appears to be an increasing linear trend in rates of offspring MDD with increasing number of episodes of MDD in parents.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Using data from this study, Richard Rende, Ph.D. provided the first data on sibling resemblance for psychiatric disorders in offspring at high and low risk for depression. Sibling resemblance for depression was of a similar magnitude in both the high and low risk cohorts. However, striking differences were found for anxiety disorders, as sibling aggregation was much more noticeable in the high risk cohort. This finding suggests the genetic contribution to affective disorders may become manifest through early-emerging anxiety disorders.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Offspring of Opiate Addicts</B>  In a study of offspring of opiate addicts, recruitment and psychiatric assessment of an ethnically diverse sample of 156 methadone-maintained opiate addicts from local area methadone clinics and 200 of their offspring has been completed. Neurological examinations conducted by Abba Cargan, M.D. in the Department of Pediatric Neurology have been performed on 102 of the offspring. Preliminary findings include high rates of psychiatric treatment, psychiatric disorders, and substance use in the offspring. Further, neurological soft signs in the offspring, particularly slowness in executing motor tasks, are associated both with lifetime histories of disruptive behavior disorders and with deficits in intellectual functioning.

<B>New Research Findings in Epidemiology</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Cross National Epidemiology</B>  A major study on the cross national epidemiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has been published, presenting data on the prevalence rates, age of onset, symptom profiles, and comorbidity of OCD. The study uses <BR>
DSM-III from community surveys in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, Germany, Taiwan, Korea, and New Zealand. There is remarkable consistency in these countries where the annual rate for OCD ranges from 1.1/100 in Korea and New Zealand to 1.8/100 in Puerto Rico. The only exception is Taiwan (.4/100) which has the lowest rate of all psychiatric disorders. There is also consistency in the age of onset, comorbidity with major depression, and other anxiety disorders. There is variability among countries in the predominance of obsessions or compulsions. These findings suggest the robustness of OCD as a disorder in quite diverse parts of the world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Also published were data on the lifetime prevalence/100 and age at onset of major depression and bipolar disorder from the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, France, Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Taiwan, Korea, and New Zealand. The symptom profiles, comorbidity, secular trends, and marital status as a risk factor are also presented cross nationally. The lifetime rates for major depression vary widely across countries. The age at onset in early adulthood shows less variation. There was a preponderance of females in the rates of major depression across all countries. In contrast, the rates of bipolar disorder are more consistent across countries, and the sex ratios are nearly equal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Laura Mufson, Ph.D. is conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) compared with clinical management type of treatment. Dr. Mufson adapted the original IPT manual for use with depressed adolescents; it was published by Guildford Press as a book titled Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents. Further plans include development of a Maintenance IPT-A treatment to administer to adolescents who have recovered during the three-month treatment in an attempt to prevent recurrence of depressive episodes.
