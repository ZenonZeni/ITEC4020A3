<H3>Go For Publicity</H3>
<P>All of your events will need widespread publicity to ensure their success. Suggestions for involving the news media and generating publicity are described in this section.

<P>It’s a good idea to involve the news media in your planning from the very start. Discuss with them the types of coverage that might be available, and propose various story ideas and angles for coverage.
<P>The news media in your community might be interested in sponsoring or co-sponsoring some of the events as well.
<P><STRONG>Media Relations</STRONG>
<P>It’s very important to have solid contacts in the news media. One person in your group should be designated as the media contact person. Don’t confuse the media with a number of spokespersons or contacts. One of your first jobs is to explain the purpose of your project to the media. Then, closer to the event dates, supply them with specific background facts (a media fact sheet) to generate coverage. But remember, the news media will make the final judgment on what is newsworthy and interesting! You can help them by determining what they want.
<P>Consider inviting some or all of the news media in your community to co-sponsor the event. This could ensure more publicity. But please note that this works best in a community where you have only one radio or TV station, or one newspaper. In a multimedia community, competition among the media could mean that co-sponsorship by one might mean no help or coverage by the others. Determine whether this potential problem is worth the additional coverage you would get

<P><STRONG>Radio, TV, Cable</STRONG>
<P>To repeat: Make early contact with the electronic media in your community. Ways to cover your event will be numerous:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>News and discussion programs.
<LI>Talk shows.
<LI>Phone-in programs with energy representatives. 
<LI>Public service announcements (10, 30, and 60 second announcements that plug Energy Awareness Month and your event).
</UL>

<P>Start by contacting the station manager and ask whom you should work with, which probably will be the news director. You will also be dealing with news reporters, program producers, community affairs directors, and talk show hosts.
<P><STRONG>News Reporters</STRONG>
<P>Give them the quick news story -- what’s happening, when, where, why and how. They may want to interview one of the leaders to provide an actuality.  Make sure you pick an articulate spokesperson for the interview.
<P><STRONG>Program Producers</STRONG>
<P>Producers may see your energy event as a peg on which to hang a whole series of programs.
<P><STRONG>Talk Show Hosts</STRONG>
<P>Talk shows provide an opportunity to present more background and details on your event because you have more time to talk about it. Remember that on radio you have to paint pictures for the listener. Use anecdotes to illustrate what you have to say. For television, bring along slides or other visual materials.
<P><STRONG>Visuals for TV</STRONG>
<P>To attract TV coverage during your event, you will need good visuals, that is, photographs, exhibits, videotapes, and so forth. This requires thought and creativity. If you are really eager to get on TV, make a special effort to talk with the producer and determine angles for his program. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on short notice if they decide to cover an event.

<P><STRONG>News Releases</STRONG>
<P>As soon as you have decided to hold an event, issue a news release outlining all of the activities. Include the pertinent facts: date, broad description of planned activities, comment on importance and purpose. You may want to quote the person responsible for the activities -- the event coordinator.
<P>Later, give the news media more facts as they become available. Add the human interest stories, mentioned previously, once you have managed to collect them.
<P>Two weeks before the event, issue a news release detailing all the planned activities. Make sure you specify exact times and places. Have someone available to answer media calls which will result from the release. This should be the contact person, and the name and number should be listed on the news release (home and work numbers). If an interesting event develops at the last minute, telephone the newspaper or broadcast station, making sure you have all of your facts in order first.
<P><STRONG>Media Mailing List</STRONG>
<P>Send your news releases to the following:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>News editors of daily and weekly newspapers.  
<LI>News editors of radio stations.  
<LI>News editors of TV stations. 
<LI>News directors for cable news channels.
<LI>Feature editors of daily and weekly newspapers.  
<LI>Consumer reporters. 
<LI>Radio and TV program producers. 
<LI>Picture editors of newspapers. 
<LI>Editors of city or regional magazines. 
<LI>Public Affairs directors for all media. 
<LI>Community or civic organization newspapers or newsletters (check  deadlines).
</UL>
<P>A word to the wise: Don’t send your releases to more than one person at each media outlet, unless you let all concerned know who is receiving what.
<P><STRONG>Proclamations</STRONG>
<P>Mayors, city councils, boards of supervisors, boards of education and civic organizations are often willing to issue an official proclamation or pass a resolution in recognition of a special event. If you make it official in your community, tell the news media. Ask them to attend the signing ceremony, and distribute copies of the proclamation or resolution.

<P><STRONG>Community Calendars</STRONG>
<P>Most newspapers, radio stations, TV stations and cable services have free listings for upcoming events in the local area. Other sources include a local telephone-recorded information or library service. Public service announcements (PSAs) on local radio, TV and cable facilities may be available for promoting your event. PSAs are run repeatedly and could effectively publicize your events. Contact the station manager. Check copy deadlines. Most media expect you to provide the exact text for the listings, so double-check it for accuracy before sending it in, making clear which publication or airdate(s) it is for.
<P><STRONG>Posters and Pamphlets</STRONG>
<P>Posters can be expensive to produce, and it takes time to arrange for their display in enough places to make an impact. Think about a dual-purpose leaflet/poster that is more easily displayed on bulletin boards and in shop windows. Try to latch on to an existing distribution system, such as branch libraries, branches of financial institutions, voluntary organizations and/or your own member organizations. Be sure to allow enough time for the leaflet posters to get through the distribution system. Arrange a spot check to ensure the system is working.
<P><STRONG>Distribution to Community Organizations</STRONG>
<P>Experience has shown that response to leaflet distribution to community organizations and neighborhood groups is often very poor. It’s probably a waste of time to send such publicity out blind.  Personal contact to interest someone in the organization who will ensure distribution and to find the best timing is essential.

<P><STRONG>Publicity After the Event</STRONG>
<P>You may be able to squeeze double publicity out of some events by having a follow-up release after the event is over. For example, if you run a contest, you can have a separate prize award presentation a week or so afterwards.

<P>It’s vital to the success of<STRONG> Energy Awareness Month</STRONG> to include some bold activities that attract the public, particularly to your exhibition, and attract the media to cover your events, thus bringing you free publicity. People enjoy it, too! Here are some "tried and true" ideas:

<P>Recruit a rock band, brass band or marchers. Make a lot of noise and get attention. As people flock to see and hear what’s going on, follow up with free leaflets, buttons, etc. Interest them in looking at the display.

<P>Recruit free dancers (like an exercise dance group) with recorded music.

<P>Arrange for large banners across main shopping areas. First, get permission from local authorities.
Get a local TV or sports personality to visit some of the events or to open the event(s). Go for someone who is well known to the general public, rather than an energy expert.   Arrange a photo opportunity for the local media. A local celebrity usually guarantees a picture in the local paper, whatever the event. You can also arrange for your own photographer to take pictures for the record. It helps to have more than one flash going off as picture-taking is an event itself and attracts attention.

<P>Arrange for a civic opening. This is more dignified razzmatazz, but it does the same job. It also gives added weight to your event when it is recognized in the official calendar of civic events. Book the date well in advance with the secretary to the mayor, council chair or other official. Nearer to the date, discuss all details including the exact timetable. As with any distinguished visitor, make sure there is someone to greet him/her, introduce them to others involved, and take them around the exhibit or event.

<P>Arrange for visits to the exhibition by other newsworthy people, such a local state legislator, your congressman, the governor, or someone representing the governor. Their press secretaries will usually help with publicity arrangements. If you get a national figure, then contact national media as well.
