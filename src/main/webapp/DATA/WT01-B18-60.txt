The graph shows the predicted and recorded tides at the UTMSI Pier
Laboratory tide gage located off the South Jetty of the Aransas Pass (27
50.3'N; 097 03.0'W) which connects Corpus Christi Bay to the Gulf of
Mexico.  The graph covers a 14-day period starting 30 September 1996 during which
high tides from Tropical Storm Josephine caused considerable coastal
flooding and beach erosion.  The peak high came at 0158 CDT 07 October
1996 with a level of 3' 1" above Mean Sea Level (MSL).  At that time
Josephine still bore the ignominious name "Tropical Depression #10", but
even so, erosion from this storm produced the most beach erosion on
Mustang Island since Hurricane Allen in August 1980, slightly greater than
September 1988's Hurricane Gilbert erosion.<BR>

The tides are referenced to MSL.  Note that almost all of October's tides
are above MSL.  October has the highest astronomical tides of the
year.  Note also that the storm-elevated water level remained high
for nearly a week and that it fortunately arrived as the
astronomical tides were in a diminishing period.  One week earlier
or later and an additional foot of water would have done even
greater damage.
