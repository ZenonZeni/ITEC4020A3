<FONT SIZE=+1><B>1.  What do police officers look for when searching for drunk </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>    drivers on the highways?</FONT></B>
	The following is a list of symptoms in descending order of 
	probability that the person observed is driving while 
	intoxicated. The list is based upon research conducted by the 
	National Highway Traffic Administration:
		(1)  Turning with a wide radius
		(2)  Straddling center of lane marker
		(3)  "Appearing to be drunk"
		(4)  Almost striking object or vehicle
		(5)  Weaving
		(6)  Driving on other than designated highway
		(7)  Swerving
		(8)  Speed more than 10 mph below limit
		(9)  Stopping without cause in traffic lane
		(10) Following too closely
		(11) Drifting
		(12) Tires on center or lane marker
		(13) Braking erratically
		(14) Driving into opposing or crossing traffic
		(15) Signalling inconsistent with driving actions
		(16) Slow response to traffic signals
		(17) Stopping inappropriately (other than in lane)
		(18) Turning abruptly or illegally
		(19) Accelerating or decelerating rapidly
		(20) Headlights off
	Speeding, incidentally, is not a symptom of DUI; because of 
	quicker judgment and reflexes, it may indicate sobriety.

<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>2.  If I'm stopped by a police officer and he asks me if I've been </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>    drinking, what should I say?  </FONT></B>
	You are not required to answer potentially incriminating 
	questions. A polite "I would like to speak with an attorney 
	before I answer any questions" is a good reply. On the other 
	hand, saying that you had one or two beers is not incriminating: 
	it is not sufficient to cause intoxication -- and it may 
	explain the odor of alcohol on the breath.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>3.  Do I have a right to an attorney when I'm stopped by an officer </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>    and asked to take a field sobriety test?</FONT></B>
	The law on this varies from state to state. As a general rule, 
	however, there is no right to an attorney until you have 
	submitted to (or refused) blood, breath or urine testing. In 
	some states, there is a right to consult with counsel upon 
	being arrested or before deciding whether to submit to chemical 
	testing. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot ask for one.
<HR>
</PRE><PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>4.  What is the officer looking for during the initial detention </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>    at the scene?</FONT></B>
	The traditional symptoms of intoxication taught at the police 
	academies are:
		(1)  Flushed face
		(2)  Red, watery, glassy and/or bloodshot eyes
		(3)  Odor of alcohol on breath
		(4)  Slurred speech
		(5)  Fumbling with wallet trying to get license
		(6)  Failure to comprehend the officer's questions
		(7)  Staggering when exiting vehicle
		(8)  Swaying/instability on feet
		(9)  Leaning on car for support
		(10) Combative, argumentative, jovial or other 
		     "inappropriate" attitude
		(11) Soiled, rumpled, disorderly clothing
		(12) Stumbling while walking
		(13) Disorientation as to time and place
		(14) Inability to follow directions
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>5.  What should I do if I'm asked to take field sobriety tests?</B></FONT>
	There are a wide range of field sobriety tests (FSTs), 
	including heel-to-toe, finger-to-nose, one-leg stand, alphabet 
	recitation, modified position of attention, fingers-to-thumb, 
	hand pat, etc.  Most officers will use a set battery of three 
	to five such tests.
	Unlike the chemical test, where refusal to submit may have
	serious consequences, you are not legally required to take
	any FSTs. The reality is that officers have usually made up 
	their minds to arrest when they give the FSTs; the tests are 
	simply additional evidence which the suspect inevitable "fails".  
	Thus, in most cases a polite refusal may be appropriate.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=+1>6.  Why did the officer make me follow a penlight with my eyes to 	</FONT></B>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>    the left and right? </FONT></B>
	This is the "horizontal gaze nystagmus" test, a relatively 
	recent development in DUI investigation. The officer attempts 
	to estimate the angle at which the eye begins to jerk 
	("nystagmus" is medical jargon for eye jerking); if this occurs
	sooner than 45 degrees, it theoretically indicates an excessive
	blood-alcohol concentration. The smoothness of the eye's 
	tracking the penlight (or finger or pencil) is also a factor, 
	as is the jerking when the eye is as far to the side as 
	it can go.
	This field sobriety test has proven to be subject to a number 
	of different problems, not the least of which is the 
	non-medically trained officer's ability to recognize nystagmus 
	and estimate the angle of onset.  Because of this, and the fact
	that the test is not accepted by the medical community, it is 
	not admissible as evidence in many states; it continues, however, 
	to be widely used by law enforcement.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>7.  Should I agree to take a chemical test? What happens if I don't?</B></FONT>
	The consequences of refusing to submit to a blood, breath or 
	urine test varies according to the state.  Generally, there 
	are three adverse results:
		(1)  Your driver's license will be suspended for a 	
		     period of time, commonly three, six or twelve 	
		     months.  This is true even if you are found not 	
		     guilty of the DUI charge.
		(2)  In some states, refusal is a separate crime; in 	
		     others, it adds jail time to the sentence for the 	
		     DUI offense.
		(3)  The fact of refusal can be introduced into
		     evidence as "consciousness of guilt".  Of course, 
		     the defense is free to offer other reasons for 
		     the refusal.
	Thus, the decision is one of weighing the likelihood of a high 
	blood-alcohol reading against the consequences for refusing.  
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>8.  Do I have a choice of chemical tests?  Which should I choose?</B></FONT>
	In most states, you have a choice -- usually, of breath, blood 
	or urine (some states, however, do not offer urinalysis).  If 
	you choose breath, many jurisdictions permit you to have a 
	second test or blood or urine; this is because a breath sample 
	is not saved and so cannot later be re-analyzed by the defense.
	Analysis of a blood sample is potentially the most accurate.  
	Breath machines are susceptible to a number of problems 
	rendering them often unreliable. The least accurate by far, 
	however, is urinalysis.  Thus, if you are confident that you 
	are sober, a blood sample is the wise choice; urine, being 
	least accurate and most easily impeached, is the best option if 
	you believe your blood-alcohol concentration is above the 
	legal limit.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>9.  The officer never gave me a Miranda warning: Can I get my case </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>    dismissed?</FONT></B>
	No.The officer is supposed to give a 5th Amendment warning 
	after he arrests you. Often, however, they do not. The only 
	consequence is that the prosecution cannot use any of your 
	answers to questions asked by the police after the arrest.
	Of more consequence in most cases is the failure to advise 
	you of the state's "implied consent" law that is, your 
	legal obligation to take a chemical test and the results 
	if you refuse. This can effect the suspension of your license.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>10.  Why am I being charged with TWO crimes?</B></FONT>
	The traditional offense is "driving under the influence of 
	alcohol" (DUI) or, in some states, "driving while intoxicated" 
	(DWI). In recent years, however, 43 states have also enacted 
	a second, so-called "per se" offense: driving with an excessive 
	blood-alcohol concentration (either .08% or .10%).  In those 
	states, BOTH offenses are charged.  The defendant can even be 
	convicted of both, but can be punished for only one.
	If the case involves a refusal to submit to chemical testing, 
	of course, only the traditional offense will be charged.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>11.  The officer took my license and served me with a notice of </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>     suspension after the breath test: How can he do that if I'm </FONT></B>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>     presumed innocent?</FONT></B>
	Agreed, it is blatantly unfair. But the law in most states 
	having a "per se" statute (see question #10) provides for 
	immediate suspension and confiscation of the license if the 
	breath test result is above the legal limit (or, in the case 
	of a blood or urine test, if the officer reasonably believes 
	the result will be above the limit).
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>12.  Can I represent myself? What can a lawyer do for me?</B></FONT>
	You can represent yourself -- although it is not a good idea.  
	"Drunk driving" is a very complex field with increasingly 
	harsh consequences. There is a minefield of complicated 
	procedural, evidentiary, constitutional, sentencing and 
	administrative license issues.
	What can a lawyer do?  Nothing (or worse) if he is not 
	qualified in this highly specialized field -- no more than a 
	family doctor could help with brain surgery.  A qualified 
	attorney, however, can review the case for defects, suppress 
	evidence, compel discovery of such things as calibration and 
	maintenance records for the breath machine, have blood samples 
	independently analyzed, negotiate for a lesser charge or 
	reduced sentence, obtain expert witnesses for trial, contest 
	the administrative license suspension, etc.  
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>13.  How can I find a qualified drunk driving lawyer?</B></FONT>
	The best way to find a good DUI/DWI lawyer is by reputation.  
	There are a few attorneys who have national reputations; these, 
	of course, are expensive.  Thus, the best approach is to ask 
	other attorneys in the jurisdiction:  Who is the best in the 
	area? If you do not know any attorneys, go to the local 
	courthouse and ask people like bailiffs, clerks and public 
	defenders: Who would THEY go to if arrested for drunk driving?
	Contrary to popular belief, it is not a wise idea to obtain a 
	referral from the local Bar association or referral service.  
	There are rarely any qualifications required for an attorney to 
	be on a referral list; he usually only has to ask to be placed 
	on it.  When you call, you are simply given the next name on 
	that list.
	An excellent indication of quality and experience is membership 
	in the NATIONAL COLLEGE FOR DUI DEFENSE, located in Atlanta, 
	Georgia (800-442-2291).  Completion of that organization's 
	intensive annual summer seminar at Harvard Law School is another 
	clear sign of ability.
	When you meet with the attorney, make sure of three things:
		(1)  He has extensive experience in DUI/DWI litigation;
		(2)  He has a reputation for going to trial in 	
		     appropriate cases, rather than just "copping out" 	
		     his clients; and
		(3)  The financial terms of representation are clear.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>14.  What will it cost to get a lawyer?</B></FONT>
	This varies, of course, by the reputation and experience of 
	the lawyer and by the geographic location.  As with doctors, 
	generally, the more skilled the attorney and the larger the 
	city, the higher the fee.  A related factor is the amount of 
	time a lawyer devotes to his cases: the better lawyers take 
	fewer clients, spending more hours on each.
	The range of fees is huge.  A general practitioner in a small
	community may charge only $300; a DUI specialist with a 
	national reputation may charge $7500.  In addition, the fee 
	may vary by such other factors as:
		(1)  Is the offense a misdemeanor or felony?
		(2)  If prior convictions are alleged, the procedures 	
		     for attacking them may add to the cost.
		(3)  The fee may or may not include trial or appeals.
		(4)  Administrative license suspension procedures may 
		     also be extra.
		(5)  The lawyer may charge a fixed fee, or he may ask 
		     for a retainer in advance -- to be applied 
		     against hourly charges.
		(6)  Costs such as witness fees, independent blood 	
		     analysis, service of subpoenas, etc., may be extra.
	Whatever the fee quoted, you should ask for a written agreement 
	and make sure you understand all the terms.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>15.  What is the punishment for drunk driving?</B></FONT>
	Again, this varies according to the laws of the state and the 
	customs of the local jurisdiction.  Generally speaking, a 
	conviction for a first offense may involve a fine, a license 
	suspension or restriction, attendance at a DUI education 
	course for a period of time, and probation for perhaps three 
	years. A short jail sentence may or may not be required; for 
	a second offense, it almost certainly will.  Additional 
	punishment may involve community service, ignition interlock 
	devices and/or impounding of the vehicle.
<HR>
</PRE><PRE><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>16.  What is a sentence "enhancement"?</B></FONT>
	Most states increase the punishment in drunk driving cases 
	if certain facts exist. The most common of these is an earlier 
	conviction for the same or a similar offense -- usually 
	within five or seven years of the current offense.  Other 
	commonly encountered enhancements (which must usually be 
	alleged in the complaint) include:
		(1)  A child was in the car at the time.
		(2)  The defendant was travelling 20 or 30 miles over 
		     the speed limit at the time.
		(3)  The blood-alcohol concentration was over .20%.
		(4)  The defendant refused to submit to a chemical test.
		(5)  There was property damage or injury.
	In most states, the existence of any personal injury caused 
	by drunk driving elevates the offense to a felony.  A death 
	can trigger manslaughter or even, in a few states, second 
	degree murder charges.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>17.  What is a "rising BAC defense"?</B></FONT>
	It is unlawful to have an excessive blood-alcohol 
	concentration (BAC) at the time of DRIVING -- not at the 
	time of being TESTED.  Since it takes between 45 minutes 
	and 3 hours for alcohol to be absorbed into the system, an 
	individual's BAC may continue to rise for some time after 
	he is stopped and arrested.  
	Commonly, it is an hour or more after the stop when the 
	blood, breath or urine test is given to the suspect. Assume 
	that the result is .12%.  If the suspect has continued to 
	absorb alcohol since he was stopped, his BAC at the time he 
	was driving may have been only .08%. In other words, the test 
	result shows a blood-alcohol concentration above the legal 
	limit -- but his actual BAC AT THE TIME OF DRIVING was below.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>18.  What is "mouth alcohol"?</B></FONT>
	"Mouth alcohol" refers to the existence of any alcohol in the 
	mouth or esophagus. If this is present during a breath test, 
	then the results will be falsely high.  This is because the 
	breath machine assumes that the breath is from the lungs; 
	for complex physiological reasons, its internal computer 
	multiplies the amount of alcohol by 2100.  Thus, even a tiny 
	amount of alcohol breathed directly into the machine from the 
	mouth or throat can have a huge impact.
	Mouth alcohol can be caused in many ways. Belching, burping, 
	hiccupping or vomiting within 20 minutes of taking the test 
	can bring vapor from alcoholic beverages still in the stomach 
	up into the mouth and throat. Taking a breath freshener can 
	send a machine's reading way up (such products as Binaca and 
	Listerine have alcohol in them); cough syrups and other 
	products also contain alcohol.  Dental bridges and dental 
	caps can trap alcohol.  Blood in the mouth from an injury is 
	yet another source of inaccurate breath test results: 
	breathed into the mouthpiece, any alcohol in the blood will 
	be multiplied 2100 times.
</PRE><P><HR>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>19.  What defenses are there in a DUI case?</B></FONT>
	Potential defenses in a given drunk driving case are almost 
	limitless due to the complexities of the offense.  Roughly 
	speaking, however, the majority can be broken down into the 
	following areas:
		(1)  Driving.  Intoxication is not enough: the 
		     prosecution must also prove that the defendant 
		     was driving. This may be difficult if, as in the
		     case of accidents, there are no witnesses to his 
		     being the driver of the vehicle.
		(2)  Probable cause. Evidence will be suppressed if 
		     the officer did not have legal cause to (a) stop, 
		     (b) detain, and (c) arrest.  Sobriety roadblocks 
		     present particularly complex issues.
		(3)  Miranda. Incriminating statements may be 
		     suppressed if warnings were not given at the 
		     appropriate time.
		(4)  Implied consent warnings. If the officer did not 
		     advise you of the consequences of refusing to 
		     take a chemical test, or gave it incorrectly, 
		     this may affect admissibility of the test results 
		     -- as well as the license suspension imposed by 
		     the motor vehicle department.
		(5)  "Under the influence". The officer's observations 
		     and opinions as to intoxication can be questioned 
		     -- the circumstances under which the field 
		     sobriety tests were given, for example, or the 
		     subjective (and predisposed) nature of what the 
		     officer considers as "failing".  Too, witnesses 
		     can testify that you appeared to be sober.
		(6)  Blood-alcohol concentration. There exists a wide 
		     range of potential problems with blood, breath 
		     or urine testing. "Non-specific" analysis, for 
		     example: most breath machines will register many 
		     chemical compounds found on the human breath as 
		     alcohol. And breath machines assume a 2100-to-1 
		     ratio in converting alcohol in the breath into 
		     alcohol in the blood; in fact, this ratio varies 
		     widely from person to person (and within a 
		     person from one moment to another).  Radio 
		     frequency interference can result in inaccurate 
		     readings. These and other defects in analysis 
		     can be brought out in cross-examination of the 
		     state's expert witness, and/or the defense can 
		     hire its own forensic chemist.
		(7)  Testing during the absorptive phase. The blood, 
		     breath or urine test will be unreliable if done 
		     while you are still actively absorbing alcohol 
		     (it takes 45 minutes to three hours to complete 
		     absorption; this can be delayed if food is 
		     present in the stomach).  Thus, drinking "one 
		     for the road" can cause inaccurate test results.
		(8)  Retrograde extrapolation. This refers to the 
		     requirement that the BAC be "related back" in 
		     time from the test to the driving (see question 
		     #17).  Again, a number of complex physiological 
		     problems are involved here.
		(9)  Regulation of blood-alcohol testing.  The 
		     prosecution must prove that the blood, breath or 
		     urine test complied with state requirements as 
		     to calibration, maintenance, etc.
		(10) License suspension hearings. A number of issues 
		     can be raised in the context of an administrative 
		     hearing before the state's department of 
		     motor vehicles.

<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1><B>20.  I have some questions about my DUI case. Where can I go </B></FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>     for answers?</FONT></B>
	An experienced drunk driving lawyer is the best source, of 
	course. Short of that:
		(1)  Go to a law library (at courthouses and law 
		     schools) and research DUI law and blood-alcohol 
		     analysis.
		(2)  Buy one of my books:
		     a. <A href=http://law.net/sponsors/taylor/books.html>Drunk Driving Defense</A>, 3rd edition 
		     	(Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1992).  
			Hardcover, 960 pages; 1995 supplement (209 
			pages) included free. The best-selling book 
			on the subject, it is considered the standard 
			text. To order, call the publisher at 
			1-800-331-1664.
		     b. <A href=http://law.net/sponsors/taylor/books.html>California Drunk Driving Defense</A>

			publisher at 1-800-848-4000.
		(3)  Consult with me on-line. (This consultation 
		     service, which will be available to both 
		     attorneys and the public, is currently UNDER 
		     CONSTRUCTION. It will be based upon hourly rates,
