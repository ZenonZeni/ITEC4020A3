<i><u>Professor A.W. Neumann</u></i><p>
     Generalization of the classical theory of capillarity to high curvature situations. 
Non-classical continuum approaches to interfacial tension problems.  Development of techniques
to determine surface tension and wettability of small particles.  Application of Digital Image
Analysis and Digital Image Processing to interfacial tension and other surface science problems. 
Studies of electrostatic and electrokinetic phenomena connected with colloidal structure and
stability. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
Solubility and Diffusivity of Blowing Agents in Polymers: The objective of this research is
to determine the solubility and diffusivity of blowing agents in polymers at elevated
temperatures and pressures up to 250¡C and 8000 psi.  The solubility and diffusivity of blowing
agents are required to determine the required flow rate of the blowing agent and the processing
time in microcellular polymer processing.  A sorption experimental set-up is utilized to
determine these thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.  Currently, the solubilities and
diffusivities of carbon dioxide, isopentane, and water in various polymers are studied.<br>
 Cell Nucleation and Growth in Polymers: The objective of this research is to develop a
simultaneous model of cell nucleation and growth in microcellular foaming process.  In order
to better control the quality of foams in manufacturing processes, the bubble dynamics in
polymer systems are investigated.  This is an analytical and experimental study designed to
determine the critical process parameters which affect bubble nucleation and growth in
processing dies.  Currently, the effects of pressure drop rate, temperature, and shearing on the
nucleation of microbubbles in polymers are being studied.  Also, research is ongoing on the
effects of pressure and temperature on bubble growth.<p>

<i><u>Professor A.N. Sinclair</u></i><p>
     The nondestructive characterization of interfacial profiles is an essential ingradient to the
quality control of welds, diffusion bonds, and adhesive joints.  Ultrasound is used to evaluate
the extent of interdiffusion at the interface, and characterize any inhomogeneities.  The work
involves extensive signal processing work, and acoustic wave theory.  The use of the surface
acoustic microscope to determine depth profiles of interfacial layers is being pursued, with
particular application to adhesive bonds. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.K. Spelt</u></i><p>
     High strength adhesives are being used widely to replace or augment welding and
mechanical fasteners, as well as to form an almost infinite variety of composite materials.  We
are studying the dynamics of adhesive wetting as the crucial first step in bond formation. Also
of interest are the environmental stability of the adhesive-substrate interfacial region, the role of
surface roughness in bond performance, and the thermodynamic interpretation of adhesion.  We
are also heavily engaged in the study of biofouling in freshwater; specifically, the recruitment
and adhesion of zebra mussels to solid surfaces such as the walls of pipes and heat exchangers.  <p>

<i><u>Professor C.A. Ward</u></i><p>
     A new theory of kinetics has been developed from quantum and statistical mechanics,
called statistical rate theory, that has a number of advantages over conventional kinetic theories. 
It is being applied at present to examine CO and H2 adsorption on single crystal planes of Ni,
and thermal desorption of CO from thin films of Ni.  Also, it is being applied to examine the
absorption of H2 into metals. <p>
