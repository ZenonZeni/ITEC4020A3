<img src="../caps/vcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="V">ietnam's garment industry, already expecting a solid year with over $1 billion in exports, is preparing to enter the promised land: a trade agreement between the US and Vietnam accompanied by the granting of Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status. That move, expected by some US negotiators to come perhaps as early as August 1997, would unleash Vietnam's garment exports on the US, the largest apparel market in the world.<p>

<img src="../december96/profile/pic.jpg" valign=top align=right alt="Factory Photo">

If MFN is granted it will lower US tariffs on key items like jackets (Category 21) and men's shirts (Category 8) down to levels where US buyers can import. The tariff on winter and fall jackets, for example, could plummet from 45% to 6.1%. The tax on men's cotton dress shirts could fall from 45% to 21%.<p>


 
Those numbers are why Bernard Gregory, an American with years of experience in the industry in the US, was dispatched to Hanoi eight months ago by a Hong Kong firm, Sven Garment Co.<p>

"Sven Garment has been here a while already. But by positioning me here we're preparing for MFN. We think we're on the threshold of seeing that," Gregory said. Sven Co. has been exporting men's dress shirts for brand-name companies like Arrow to Europe and Canada. They've mainly contracted with Garment Company #10 in Hanoi and other manufacturers in northern provinces. "Garment Co. #10 is one of the best in tailored shirts. We're very happy with their quality," Gregory said. "Their prices may be higher than the others but it's workable."<p>

Frank Miyanaga, the apparel manager for Nissho Iwai in New York, says Nissho Iwai is preparing for MFN by shipping samples to US customers this November. He expects to eventually sell "Made in Vietnam" garments to department store chains like Nordstroms, Saks Fifth Avenue, K-Mart and Target. They look to Vietnam to source winter and spring jackets, and casual pants, Miyanaga said.<p>

But are Vietnamese companies ready for MFN?<p>

Inside the Huy Hoang showpiece factory on Highway 1 in Thu Duc, it's hard to think that they're not. One can feel an Asian Tiger in the making here as workers on 17 assembly lines cut, sew and trim brand-name skiwear like Mistral and Descente for the Japanese market. The staccato whine of the Juki and Brother sewing machines mixed with a stereo blasting Madonna over the production floor add to the frenetic atmosphere.<p>

Huy Hoang deputy director Nguyen Van Hoan says his company is poised to increase capacity once MFN is granted. Huy Hoang plans to build a factory identical to this one, and has already cleared three hectares of land 10 km down the road. Hoan says the new plant will have a capacity of 1 million jackets per year and will employ some 2,500 workers. "Many US companies have come to visit us. Now we just wait for MFN," Hoan said.<p>

Minh Phung Company is joining Huy Hoang Co. in developing a reputation as one of the most successful private garment companies in Vietnam. For much of the past two years their main effort (like many other large garment companies) has been improving quality to meet the high standards of Japanese buyers. Why? Because unlike the EU market where quotas have limited Minh Phung's exports, Japan is an open market. Vietnamese companies can fill as many orders as they receive.<p>

Minh Phung export director, Ngo Duc Hoi, says that with the help of technology transfer from Japanese partners, Minh Phung's volume to Japan has increased three-fold over the past year. Sales to Japanese customers now account for 36% of their total exports. Huy Hoang has employed the same strategy and now 23% of their exports go to Japan, up from 15% last year. Minh Phung has signed big contracts to supply Toyota with work clothes; Huy Hoang is making uniforms for Japan Airlines, for example.<p>

Now, however, Hoi says he is turning his attention to the US market. He's especially enthusiastic about the possibility of selling denim items to the US. They're looking for a bonanza of sales in the first year or two before the US sets quota limitations on Vietnamese garment imports.<p>

"This year we made a $3 million investment to build five new factories because most of our capacity is already booked for European, Japanese, and Korean markets," Hoi said. "We'll probably have to recruit 3,000 more workers because everyone's expecting MFN for 1997."<p>

Minh Phung's strategy will be to cut prices to fill as many orders as it can, which Hoi estimates will be around 500,000 pieces in the first year to the US. He hopes that by doing so, Minh Phung will not only get exposure to more US buyers, but it will position itself to receive favorable quota allocation from the Ministries of Trade and Industry when the inevitable US quotas do come.<p>

While Huy Hoang and Minh Phung are stellar performers in the private sector, many buyers have been going to big state-owned firms for contracts. Nissho Iwai has been contracting with one of Vietnam's largest garment/textile operations, Thang Cong Garment, as well as Viet Tien Garment.<p>

Some major Japanese trading companies that are investing in training and machinery with local firms in return for cheaper apparel prices, are turning to state firms for the security of government guarantees and for the preferential quota allocations they receive for the EU market.<p>

However, it is not only the large private and state companies which will have to expand capacity to meet the expected surge in orders. For Vietnam to take full economic advantage of MFN, buyers in HCMC say that the smaller to mid-sized manufacturers which in the past have sold to the domestic market, will have to start producing to international standards if they want to capture US orders.<p>

"Probably 75-80% of the companies here haven't been doing exports so they don't have the foggiest idea about international business yet," one buyer said. "Once MFN happens, somebody here is going to have to start learning. It is critical that they know the customs bureaucracy , the import-export procedures, and this is going to be a slow moving process."<p>

The second area where Vietnam may need to improve is in price. Vietnam has cultivated a reputation for having skilled, educated workers that produce some of the best quality garments in Asia. Unfortunately, Vietnam is also renowned for high prices.<p>

The country manager for a HCMC-based Australian firm says he brought a client to Vietnam to manufacture women's underwear. But after shopping around, the best price they could find was 35 cents per piece, when the price in China had been 22 cents. "All the buyers know that Vietnam's quality is outstanding," he said, "but it doesn't justify a 35 to 22 cent price difference." After witnessing one too many 13-cent differentials, this manager stopped sourcing garments and looked for other products to export.<p>

Deputy manager Hoan at Huy Hoang Co. emphasizes that Vietnam's quality and delivery times are better than in China, but concedes that costs are higher. He says the absence of raw materials and expensive customs and delivery processes are partly to blame. Some 90% of Vietnam's garment industry remains cut, make and trim (CMT), where buyers supply fabric and local companies assemble the material into finished items. One of the reasons is that Vietnam's textile industry has not advanced much from its pre-doi moi days (or from the 1950s for that matter), so nearly all of the fabric going into clothing made in Vietnam needs to be imported. That increases costs.<p>

Another nightmare increasing costs is the 40% tax levied on imported fabric that cannot be used, termed wastage. Local manufacturers say that wastage amounts are usually in the 5% range, but the government only allows for 3% wastage. Therefore they are forced to pay import tax on material that cannot be used.<p>

Minh Phung's Hoi complains: "They're very strict about wastage requirements, but the amount of wastage is different depending on the item and the type of fabric you use." Although a number of companies are able to resolve the problem directly with customs officials, formal complaints have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry, Customs Department and Ministry of Trade.<p>

Vietnam's prices haven't been so high as to drive away international buyers though. The Australian who said costs had forced him to stop sourcing underwear from Vietnam one year ago, is back sourcing from Vietnam again. With his quota in China filled, Vietnam was the next best alternative.<p>

And Sven's Gregory is convinced that Vietnam has enough going for it in the way of quota and quality to expect a boom to come with MFN. "I've been to Mongolia 12 times looking for opportunities, but the workers are better here," Gregory said. "I can't think of another country that's going to see an explosion in the garment business like Vietnam."<p>
