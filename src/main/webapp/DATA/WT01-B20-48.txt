<p align="center"><b><u>Deadline</u></b><b>: The U.S. Sentencing
Commission Requests Public Comment</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 16, 1995</b> will be the last day that
the U.S. Sentencing Commission will accept public comment on two
possible sentencing guideline changes that are relevant to
cannabis consumers charged under federal statutes.&nbsp; *Note
the new numbers that have been assigned to these proposed
guideline amendments. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposed Amendment #8 seeks to retroactively apply any guideline
changes to individual cases which will lessen an individual's
time of incarceration, or in some cases, <i><u>free</u></i>
individuals sentenced and incarcerated under the previous
guidelines.&nbsp; NORML strongly supports the passage of proposed
amendment #8 by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposed Amendment #7 seeks to create a &quot;safety valve&quot;
which will provide an exception to otherwise applicable statutory
mandatory minimum sentences for certain qualified defendants convicted
of specific drug offenses.&nbsp; NORML strongly supports the
passage of proposed amendment #7 by the U.S. Sentencing
Commission.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[To give public comment, write to: <u>U.S.
Sentencing Commission, One Columbus Circle, NE, Suite 2-500,

proposals, please contact Julie Stewart, Families Against

<p align="center"><b>CA Senate Votes To Opt Out Of &quot;Smoke A
Joint, Lose Your License&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 30,</b> Sacramento:&nbsp; By a vote of
32-3, the State Senate approved a bill that would end California's
unpopular &quot;Smoke A Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp;
The bill, SB 1198, would formally opt out of a federal mandate
requiring states to impose an automatic six-month driver's license
suspension for any drug offense, regardless of whether it is
driving-related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SB 1198 now goes to the Assembly, which recently killed an
opposing bill backed by Gov. Wilson to extend the state's
&quot;Smoke A Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp; Under
federal law, California must either extend or formally opt out of
the &quot;Smoke A Joint...,&quot; or else lose some $100 million
in highway aid.&nbsp; A recent poll shows that California voters
oppose &quot;Smoke A Joint...&quot; by 63% - 32%. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on SB 1198, please contact Dale Gieringer,
CA NORML, (415) 563-5858.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Orange County Register</i></b><b> Opines
In Favor Of Medical Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 25,</b> The <i>Orange County Register</i>
has once again favorably weighed in on the subject of medicinal
marijuana: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Medicine exists to heal and to relieve pain....&nbsp;
Unfortunately, government unreasonably restricts some substances
that could help patients.&nbsp; One is marijuana, which greatly
reduces the suffering of those afflicted with such ailments as
glaucoma, cancer, and AIDS.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Unfortunately, California law prohibits marijuana use in
all cases, including even clear medical use by
prescription.&nbsp; Assembly Bill 1529 would relieve the pain and
suffering of many people by allowing marijuana to be used under a
doctor's supervision.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;...otherwise law-abiding citizens suffering from cancer or
some other ailment, illegally obtain marijuana, and so become
targets for arrest and imprisonment....&nbsp; Courts and police
should be going after killers and rapists, not cancer
patients.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Morphine and other drugs, though banned in the market, are
allowed as prescription medications to relieve pain.&nbsp; Why
should marijuana be any different?&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Gatewood Galbraith Runs A Strong Fourth In
KY Gubernatorial Race</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 26,</b> Versailles, KY:&nbsp; &quot;<u>The
stakes are high.&nbsp; Freedom is the issue</u>.&quot;&nbsp; With
these words, Galbraith ended his 1995 bid for Governor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Former NORML board member and perennial gubernatorial candidate
Gatewood Galbraith, along with running-mate Jerry Hammond,
finished fourth in the Democratic primary with a strong 9%
showing.&nbsp; The Galbraith-Hammond campaign accomplished this
astonishing vote total with only a $20,000 campaign war chest. <br>

Hammond at (606) 873-9159/873-0955.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Kentucky Hemp Law Is ... The Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 19,</b> The <i>Wolf County News</i> (KY)
reported: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Makes no difference if you're a university researcher or a drug
dealer, growing marijuana is illegal.&nbsp; State Attorney
General Chris Gorman's ruling pretty much limits the efforts of a
state task force examining uses of a drug-free strain of hemp to
reading up on the available literature (sic).&nbsp; State Police
Commissioner Jerry Lovitt had asked Gorman to grant an exception
to the marijuana law for the state Department of Agriculture and
some universities to grow the weed for research purposes.&nbsp;
Nothing doing: Gorman said, &quot;We find no exception in Chapter
218A that would allow the government to grow
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; A task force appointed by Gov. Brereton
Jones had hoped to experiment with growing a drug-free European
variety of hemp as a possible replacement for tobacco as a cash
crop in Kentucky.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Activist On Trial For Birdseed In
Texas</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A demonstration and press conference will be held
on Monday, <b>June 5,</b> at 1:00 PM outside the Smith County
Courthouse in Tyler, Texas.&nbsp; Cannabis Action Network (CAN)
activist Kevin Aplin will be going on trial for felony possession
of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The charges stem from a re-legalize cannabis rally held in Tyler
back in September where Aplin was arrested for possessing a
one-pound bag of legal, government sterilized hemp seed.&nbsp;
The seed was part of an educational display on the environmental
and economic benefits of hemp.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on the trial and
demonstration, please contact Kevin Aplin, Louisiana CAN, (504)
861-2956 or his attorney, Gary Wainwright, (504) 822-3104.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Update</u></b><b>: Jimmy Montgomery ...
Cause And Effect</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1,</b> Wheelchair-bound Jimmy Montgomery
suffered a bladder infection this week.&nbsp; This was brought on
by the fact that three replacement urine bags, sent by his
mother, have not been made available for him to use.&nbsp; While
Jimmy is receiving adequate treatment for the bladder infection,
the same can not be said about the chronic infections on his
legs.&nbsp; For Jimmy, those infections remain a constant source
of unnecessary and excessive pain and discomfort.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[To advocate an end to Jimmy's prolonged and
unjustified imprisonment, please contact both the offices of Gov.
Frank Keating, (405) 521-2342 <u>and</u> the <i>Oklahoma City

<p align="center"><b>Maine Legislature Rejects Medical Marijuana
Bill</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1,</b> <i>USA Today</i> reports that,
