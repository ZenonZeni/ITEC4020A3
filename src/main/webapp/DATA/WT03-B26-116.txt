<H3>Additional Disturbance Factors </H3>
<HR>

<P>
Feral animals are significant agents of biotic erosion and they
are likely to exacerbate the consequences of landcover disturbance
by clearing and grazing. The distribution of feral animal density
varies across the continent. In broad terms, the simplest question
to ask of the feral animal distribution data is whether there
was a significant contrast between the ILZ and ELZ?
<P>
The answer to this question was not surprising and is presented
in graphical form.
<P>
The greatest presence of rabbits (low, moderate and high densities)
was found in the ILZ rather than the ELZ. The same can be said
for both foxes and pigs.<HR>

<P>
Conversely, the density of feral cats was evenly distributed between
the two landuse zones.
<P>
The conclusion that we draw from the graphs is that the highest
densities, and thus probable impacts on biodiversity, of rabbits,
foxes and pigs are coincident with the most significant landcover
disturbance, clearing.<HR>
