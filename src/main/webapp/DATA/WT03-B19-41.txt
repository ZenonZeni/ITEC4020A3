<H2>SeaSpace: Committed to Satellite Remote Sensing</H2>
<P>
The SeaSpace charter is one of commitment to the science and practice of remote sensing.  SeaSpace is dedicated to providing its customers with the most capable and advanced products for remote sensing along with the highest levels of service and support.  SeaSpace has developed systems of integrated hardware and powerful software tools, called TeraScan®, which enable users to acquire, process, and analyze weather satellite data.  These systems have been created over many years by the SeaSpace team of scientists, engineers, and software developers.  Today, this team works closely with a growing community of people and institutions dedicated to the science and application of remote sensing.</P><P>

<P>
Based in San Diego, California, SeaSpace Corporation is founded on work started by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography whose efforts were aimed at receiving and processing data from the first generation of weather- and ocean-monitoring satellites launched in the mid-1970s.  From these early roots within the research community, SeaSpace has matured into an innovative company that develops and markets TeraScan systems throughout the world, serving the needs of both academic and commercial users as well as government agencies.</P><P>
</P>
<P>
The interplay between researchers and operational users, with feedback from one group to the other, is consistent with the company goal of continually broadening and improving TeraScan systems.  Indeed, no other company in the world is more committed to the advancement of the science and practice of earth remote sensing.</P>
<P>
From the Far East to Europe, from North America to the Antarctic, SeaSpace is an international leader in remote-sensing technology, setting the standard for quality, value, and unparalleled user support.</P>

<H2>TeraScan:  A World of Applications</H2>
<P>
Pollution control.  Sufficient food production.  Environmentally sustainable growth and development.  These are issues that transcend all political and economic boundaries to impact the entire world.  Data collected by satellites has become a vital tool for studying and monitoring the earth's oceans, land masses, and atmosphere.  Such global monitoring is essential to many efforts aimed at addressing these global issues as they become more and more pressing.</P><P>

<P>
The number of satellites circling our globe continues to increase as new satellites are launched carrying ever more sophisticated instruments.  Most satellites carry sensors that measure visible, thermal infrared, or microwave radiation; others carry radar sensors.  The resolution of these instruments ranges from tens of kilometers to meters.  Much of this remotely sensed data can be acquired directly as it is transmitted from the satellites.  And TeraScan systems can to do just that, affording users the power and flexibility they need to take advantage of the full range of data available from these satellite sensors.</P><P>
</P>
<P>
Oceanographic applications of TeraScan systems include survey and research missions, search and rescue, ice cover analysis, biological studies, and measurement of sea surface temperatures and surface current patterns.  As an example, satellite-derived information concerning ice cover greatly improves polar navigation, enabling icebreakers to find the best pathway through pack ice.</P><P>

<P>
Terrestrial applications of TeraScan systems include mapping of vegetation, snow cover, pollution, forest fires, flooding, and volcanic activity.  For example, Forest Service firefighters now receive real-time information that aids them in locating "hot spots" in their area of surveillance, dramatically improving their fire-fighting capability.  Researchers use TeraScan to track rainfall and the seasonal changes in vegetation.  Water and airborne pollutants often have remotely detectable signatures.  Even plumes of volcanic ash, explosively thrust into the stratosphere and capable of downing jet aircraft, can be tracked as they drift with the prevailing winds.</P><P>
</P>

<P>
<H2>TeraScan Software:  It's All About Capability</H2>
<P>
It takes a robust and sophisticated software package to convert the many different types of satellite data into meaningful information.  The UNIX-based TeraScan software provides the full capability needed to control satellite tracking, data reception, and all hardware interfaces.  What primarily distinguishes TeraScan, however, is its powerful processing and analysis tools, which provide many unique advantages.</P>

<P>
TeraScan software incorporates hundreds of functions for capturing, archiving, processing, mapping, modeling, animating, annotating, and exporting remotely sensed data.  Data from geostationary, polar-orbiting, and specialized satellites, acquired in real time or from stored media, can be readily manipulated in many ways.  Data-fusion capabilities enable users to combine different types of data, including data from non-satellite sources, to reveal patterns and relationships.  Multiple map projection options are offered for precisely earth-locating images and overlaying geopolitical boundaries.</P><P>
</P>
<P>
Through a user-friendly graphical interface developed by SeaSpace, TeraScan software enables both sophisticated and inexperienced operators to access functions quickly and easily.  An advanced scripting language is available to allow full automation of all routine and repetitive sequences, beginning with antenna tracking and acquisition, through all steps of data processing, data archival, and data product distribution.</P><P>
</P>
<P>
With its open architecture and network-accessible design, TeraScan software can support one user or many users in a wide variety of settings.  Because of its unique design, TeraScan software can handle the steadily increasing number of new satellites and sensors, thereby minimizing the need for new data-handling systems.</P>
<P>
As proven in scores of installations worldwide, TeraScan software is a mature and powerful product that maximizes the utility of remotely sensed data.</P><P>
