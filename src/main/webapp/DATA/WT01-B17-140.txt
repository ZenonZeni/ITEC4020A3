<br><b><a name="anemia">ANEMIA.</a></b> Lily, aged 35, came to Marie Hoshimi-Wilkes, O.M.D., N.D., Ph.D., with a diagnosis of anemia and thalassemia (a genetic allergy to iron, supposedly incurable). She had severe migraines, digestive problems, and sleeping difficulties; her hands and feet were always cold and would go purple when especially chilled; she was unable to gain weight; and her shoulders and back always felt constricted.<p>
	Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes started treating Lily twice weekly. First she inserted acupuncture needles at the points on Lily’s back corresponding to 7 internal organs; then she burned artemisia leaf (a procedure called moxabustion) over these same points. The goal was to strengthen the function of the internal organs, disperse stagnant energy, and improve blood and energy circulation to the head and extremities. <p>
	Once weekly, Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes inserted acupuncture needles at the specific body sites of discomfort, including Lily’s shoulders and back of the neck. Then she focused green and violet light beams onto these same points. Next, she gave Lily 2 Chinese herbal formulas, including donq quai (for blood circulation) and angelica (for headaches). <p>
	Lily followed this regimen for a month, but even after the first visit, her headaches became less intense; soon after, her digestion improved, she was able to gain weight, and as her peripheral circulation improved, her hands became warmer. After several weeks, Lily experienced a healing crisis, says Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes, when she underwent a four-day bout with the flu accompanied by intense headaches. This was a positive sign that her body was staging a major detoxification.<p>
	Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes applied more acupuncture and color therapy, and gave Lily homeopathic and flower essence remedies for her acute symptoms. A month later, a conventional medical test revealed that Lily was no longer allergic to iron, meaning that Chinese medicine, expertly applied, had reversed a condition that was believed to be incurable.<p>

<br><b><a name="arthritis">ARTHRITIS.</a></b> Dr. Abram Hoffer, M.D., Ph.D., relates a case of the “sickest arthritic” he had ever seen in 35 years of practice. Victoria was confined to a wheelchair and was unable to propel herself; her hands were “horribly deformed and misshapen” and she could not extend her legs, which were swollen; she had severe, continuous pain in her arms, hips, and back; her bowels bled; she had been unable to sit up, unassisted, for 15 years; she had bouts of suicidal depression and required 24-hour complete nursing care. Victoria told Dr. Hoffer that she expected he could help her only “very little.”<p>
	Dr. Hoffer first put Victoria on a diet free from all refined sugars, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and asked her to abstain from tobacco. Then he prescribed vitamin B3 (niacinamide: 500 mg, 4 times daily); vitamin C (ascorbic acid: 500 mg, 4 times daily); vitamin B6 (pyridoxine: 250 mg, once daily); zinc sulfate (220 mg, once daily); linseed oil (2 tablespoons daily); and cod liver oil (1 tablespoon daily). <p>
	One month after starting this regimen, Victoria came in smiling to Dr. Hoffer’s office. Her back pain was much reduced, her hips were pain-free, and her bowels no longer bled. Dr. Hoffer added Linodil (inositol niacinate, a form of niacin: 500 mg, 4 times daily) to her program. <p>
	After another month, Victoria was able to sit up in bed without help for the first time in 15 years. After another 2-1/2 months, she was able to wheel herself around unassisted and she could nurse her husband, who had the flu. A year later, Victoria had regained muscle tone and strength and only had mild pain in her left arm—altogether “a remarkable response in a very sick arthritic, states Dr. Hoffer.<p>

<br><b><a name="depression">DEPRESSION.</a></b> Based on his work with hundreds of chronically depressed patients who failed to recover with antidepressant drugs, C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Shealy Institute in Springfield, Missouri, states forthrightly, “I have been able to bring 85% of these patients out of depression within two weeks, without drugs and undesirable side effects.”<p>
	First, Dr. Shealy corrects electrical abnormalities in the brain-wave patterns of depressed patients. In 75% of depressed people, the right side of the brain has more electrical activity than the left, says Dr. Shealy. Using a cranial electrical stimulator (CES: it pulses a weak electrical current) for one hour daily, 50% of patients improve within 2 weeks with no other therapy and no side effects. One patient emerged from a 16-year depression only 24 hours after his first CES treatment. CES is best applied for 40-60 minutes daily between 6 and 9 a.m., Dr. Shealy says. <p>
	As a complement to CES, Dr. Shealy recommends photostimulation using a device he invented called the Shealy RelaxMate™ for 15 minutes twice daily and for 60 minutes before bedtime. In this therapy, the patient wears goggles which have 2 lights on their inside surface; these flash at varying brightness and frequency up to a maximum of 7.5 flashes per second.<p>
	Specially selected music also provides a vibratory therapy that helps patients relax and release suppressed conflicts, says Dr. Shealy. He recommends Pachelbel’s Canon in D, Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony, Rachmaninoff’s Isle of the Dead, Mozart’s Requiem, David Ison’s Therasound, and Steven Halpern’s Spectrum Suite, among others. Listen to any of these for 1-2 hours daily, says Dr. Shealy.<p>
	Nutritional supplementation is vitally important, Dr. Shealy explains. Almost every depressed patient is deficient in at least one amino acid (protein building block); about 78% are specifically lacking in taurine and 70-80% are short in magnesium. Dr. Shealy recommends magnesium taurate at 250 mg daily, taken before sleeping, in complement with 100 mg of a vitamin B complex. Taken orally, it may take 6 months to replenish magnesium stores, but if taken intravenously, the uptake is faster. For taurine amino acid supplementation, rather than supplements, Dr. Shealy prefers a homemade meat broth (simmered 12 hours). The broth is taken at the rate of one quart daily for the first month, then one pint for months 2-3, then one cup daily forever.<p>
	About one-half of depressed patients are also deficient in an important adrenal hormone called DHEA, says Dr. Shealy. “Not one of more than 1000 depressed patients tested at the Shealy Institute has had optimal levels of DHEA.” If testing indicates your DHEA levels are too low, then supplement with DHEA for 3 months at 100 mg twice daily, Dr. Shealy recommends.<p>
	Other useful supplements for depression include beta carotene (up to 200,000 I.U., daily), vitamin C (up to 2-5 g daily), vitamin B6 (100 mg), zinc (30 mg), pycnogenol (30 mg, twice daily). Dr. Shealy further advocates aerobic exercises on a regular basis. For example, this would be building up to walking 4 miles in 60 minutes 5 days a week and walking 2 miles in 30 minutes on the sixth day. Depression is reversible, following these protocols, says Dr. Shealy. “These results represent one of the most consistent miracles of alternative healing.<p>

<br><b><a name="fatigue">FATIGUE.</a></b> After he underwent a root canal at age 15, Earl suffered severe fatigue and anxiety. At 28, he had a nervous breakdown. When he came to acupuncturist David J. Nickel, O.M.D., L.Ac., at the age of 32, Dr. Nickel performed a mercury vapor analysis on Earl’s teeth. He found that the toxic fumes from Earl’s 6 mercury-based amalgam fillings was 42 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum allowable limit. <p>
	A hair analysis indicated that Earl also had aluminum, copper, and mercury at toxic levels in his tissues and that he had an exceptionally slow metabolic rate. Earl suffered from fatigue, anger, anxiety, back problems, low blood sugar, nervousness, ringing in his ears, concentration loss, and prematurely greying hair. Dr. Nickel put Earl on a nutritional supplement program after which there was significant improvement in his metabolic rate and blood sugar levels and limited improvement in his other symptoms. <p>
	But after Earl had all 6 mercury-based amalgams and his root canal tooth removed, he began to experience major change, states Dr. Nickel. In a month, his energy level returned to what he had enjoyed 15 years earlier and he was able to exercise, work, and play strenuously with no exhaustion. His other symptoms improved as well. “I don’t remember when I have ever felt so good,” Earl said.<p>
	According to Dr. Nickel, removing the mercury fillings and root canal was responsible for Earl’s return to health. “Of the 90% of my patients with dental fillings, most have a mercury-induced copper toxicity, high calcium levels, and reduced thyroid and adrenal function,” states Dr. Nickel. “Mercury is associated with 258 different symptoms and copper with over 100. Almost all my patients who have had their mercury-based fillings removed showed moderate to dramatic improvement in their health in usually less than one month.<p>

<br><b><a name="fibromyalgia">FIBROMYALGIA.</a></b> Katie, aged 42, had suffered from whole-body pain for 5 years before receiving treatment for fibromyalgia (chronic, severe muscle pain) from Ross A. Hauser, M.D. A series of previous diagnoses, physical therapy rounds, and anti-inflammatory medications and antidepressants (such as Elavil) had brought no relief. Her neck pain was so intense she had to wear a neck brace; she also had pain in her jaw, arms, legs, and back and the ligaments in these regions were especially tender.<p>
	Dr. Hauser treated Katie with prolotherapy (also known as Reconstructive therapy), which involves the injection of a natural irritant substance (dextrose or lidocaine) into the junction of the bone and ligament or bone and tendon to encourage repair of damaged tissue and to stimulate the growth of new cells and collagen. Dr. Hauser made his injections at the tender spots over the ligaments and tendons of Katie’s arms, legs, jaw, back, and neck.<p>
	Six weeks later, she no longer needed the neck brace and was able to go swimming and walking. Six months later (after a second prolotherapy treatment), Katie experienced pain only with strenuous exercise but was otherwise “doing great,” notes Dr. Hauser. After a third prolotherapy treatment, all her symptoms abated and “Katie has been doing fine since—sleeping like a baby—and she has a smile on her face again,” Dr. Hauser says.<p>

<br><b><a name="gingivitis">GINGIVITIS.</a></b> Woodstock, New York dentist Victor Zeines, D.D.S., designed a study (1994) involving 20 healthy adults with either gingivitis or periodontitis to see how well an herbal mouth rinse could perform in reversing these early symptoms of dental decay. The study participants used the product (The Natural Dentist™ Herbal Mouth and Gum Therapy) daily for 12 weeks, rinsing with one capful for 30 seconds, twice daily. The product contains 6 herbal extracts, including Echinacea, grapefruit seed, bloodroot, aloe, goldenseal, and calendula.<p>
	At the end of the test period, gum bleeding was substantially reduced, the incidence of dental plaque was 50% less, and periodontal pockets decreased by 1-2 mm in depth from a typical depth of 4 mm, or by 25%-50%. Those patients using the placebo (a nonactive substance—in this case, a standard mouthwash) had no improvement in any category. “Patients with severe periodontal degradation reported greatly improved tissue tone and markedly reduced pocket depth,” states Dr. Zeines, referring to subsequent patient reports.<p>

<br><b><a name="head">HEAD INJURIES.</a></b> New evidence has emerged indicating that DMSO could save the lives and preserve nerve function of patients with head trauma, spinal cord injuries, and stroke, according to Stanley Jacob, M.D., professor at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, and a recognized world expert on the substance. DMSO, or dimethyl sulfoxide, was originally a papermaking by-product, but is now produced synthetically for therapeutic use. DMSO appears to reduce brain swelling and intracranial pressure following head injuries.<p>
	A Turkish study of 20 patients with severe head injuries who took DMSO within a few hours after receiving the injury, then every 6 hours afterwards until pressure in the brain was relieved, had a 75% survival rate; 14 lived and only 1 sustained nerve damage. Putting this in perspective, of 30,000 people who suffer head trauma every year, 66% die in the emergency room, 2500 remain comatose, and of the 7500 who survive, most have a high degree of brain damage, states Julian Whitaker, M.D., who uses DMSO in his practice. DMSO can be given intravenously, as injections, applied on the skin, or taken orally in fruit juice or distilled water, says Dr. Whitaker. Its only drawback is the strong odor, which lingers for a few days following intravenous infusion. <p>

<br><b><a name="heartburn">HEARTBURN.</a></b> Franklin, a 68-year-old attorney, had endured heartburn for 25 years and for the past 3 years had been taking Zantac (a conventional anti-heartburn medication) every night for relief. He noticed that the medication appeared to diminish his formerly strong sexual drive and function. <p>
	Homeopath Andrea D. Sullivan, Ph.D., N.D., gave him a single dose of homeopathic Conium Maculatum 30c (from hemlock). After the first night on this remedy, Franklin reported that he was free of heartburn for the first time in 25 years. His need to smoke and drink coffee also was diminished; he was able to discontinue the commercial medications; and his ability to have erections improved. Dr. Sullivan gave him a second dose 6 weeks later, then a single dose of Conium at 200c one year later to clear up a small amount of gastric burning that had returned.<p>

<br><b><a name="lupus">LUPUS.</a></b> When Angela first came to Jonathan V. Wright, M.D., she had lupus, a potentially fatal autoimmune disease. But she had one sterling quality that helped to guarantee her eventual cure: a positive attitude and determination to do whatever it would take to get better. Meanwhile, she was reeling from a progression of ever-higher doses of prednisone and anti-inflammatories, which had not improved her condition. <p>
	Before coming to Dr. Wright, Angela had already changed her diet to include only whole and organically raised foods and to exclude all refined sugars, preservatives, and hydrogenated fats. In addition, she was taking 24 grams of vitamin C (in doses of 6 g, 4 times daily). Dr. Wright kept her on these 2 steps, further taking her off wheat, oats, barley, rye, and any other grains (excepting corn and rice) that contain the proteins gluten and gliadin; he also took her off all dairy products. “Our clinical experience supports the view that a food allergy can trigger lupus,” states Dr. Wright.	<p>
	Next, he put Angela on hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and digestive enzymes to help with her nutrient assimilation. Dr. Wright prescribed vitamin B6 (500 mg, 3 times daily); a complete B-complex supplement (with minerals, given by injection); flax oil (one tablespoon daily); gamma-linolenic acid (from primrose, black currant, or borage oils, 240 mg daily); vitamin E (800 I.U. daily); and zinc (picolinate, 30 mg daily). He further tested Angela for other allergies or nutrient sensitivities to be certain that none of the nutritional supplements aggravated her condition; then he desensitized Angela to these substances. Dr. Wright also prescribed doses of the hormones DHEA (a typical dose is 200 mg daily for women with lupus) and testosterone.<p>
	It took about 18 months on this program to get all the nutritional factors under control and for Angela’s symptoms to abate. As of this reporting, 5 years later, she has remained symptom-free, says Dr. Wright.<p>

<br><b><a name="parkinson's">PARKINSON’S.</a></b> In a study of 885 patients with Parkinson’s disease by Jörg G. Birkmayer, M.D., Ph.D., of Vienna, Austria, NADH, delivered in either capsule or intravenous form, produced beneficial improvements in 80% of the cases. NADH, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a chemical naturally found in human cells that is necessary for energy production. In a healthy person, muscle and brain cells contain about 50 mcg of NADH per gram of tissue, while the heart tissue contains 90 mcg per gram. <p>
	In Dr. Birkmayer’s trial, 42 patients showed a 50% improvement in their disabilities, which included impairment of motor skills and cognitive dysfunction, while 54 patients experienced a 40% improvement; those patients receiving the oral form of NADH fared slightly better. NADH also seems to stimulate the production of dopamine, a brain chemical commonly deficient in patients with Parkinson’s. <p>

<br><b><a name="prostate">PROSTATE (SWOLLEN).</a></b> Andy, aged 64, suffered from a chronically enlarged prostate gland, a clinical condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, reports Mitchell A. Fleisher, M.D., who practices at the Blue Ridge Medical Center in Arrington, Virginia. Andy’s condition kept him up at night with frequent urination; as a business executive, this made long airplane flights almost unbearable. Andy had tried conventional prostate drugs (such as Proscar) but found them ineffective; saw palmetto, an herbal extract often prescribed by holistic doctors as a Proscar alternative, had also not helped him.<p>
	Dr. Fleisher put Andy on Pycnogenol®, a multipurpose antioxidant made from French maritime pine bark. Andy took this every day for 2 weeks, after which time the frequency of his day and night urinations was greatly reduced and he was able to enjoy a restful sleep. Dr. Fleisher put Andy on a “curative” dose of 100 mg, 2 times daily, for 2 weeks; at this point, Andy’s prostate had gone from hard to soft and was nearly normal again in size. Then Andy began a maintenance dose of 100 mg in the morning and 80 mg in the evening.<p>
	Pycnogenol has been proven effective in helping to reduce the risk of developing up to 70 diseases associated with free radical damage, including heart disease, arthritis, cancer, and stroke. The typical dosage, says Dr. Fleisher, is 1 mg per pound of body weight divided into 2 daily dosages, taken for 7-10 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 50-100 mg daily.<p>

<br><b><a name="stroke">STROKE.</a></b> Ten years prior to seeking treatment with David Steenblock, D.O., Sonya had suffered a stroke, which left her confined to a wheelchair and unable to take care of herself. After consulting 22 doctors for her paralysis and severe pain, she was no better and despairing. Sonya was one of the 500,000 Americans who suffer stroke each year, which tops the list as the leading cause of long-term disability and is the third leading cause of death in the U.S.<p>
	Dr. Steenblock gave Sonya 10 treatments with hyperbaric oxygen, after which her pain subsided. After another 5 treatments, Sonya was able to walk again and begin taking care of herself. <p>
	For the treatments, Dr. Steenblock placed Sonya inside a sealed chamber where she breathed oxygen through a mask as the air pressure was gradually increased. At 9 times the level provided to her body’s capillaries by breathing normal air, the oxygen began to revive  brain tissue that hadn’t functioned since the stroke. Under this higher pressure, oxygen is able to reach areas in the brain where blood flow has been restricted and stimulate new blood vessels to grow.<p>
	The use of oxygen under pressure to treat serious health conditions including stroke and athletic injuries is medically well-established, though not yet widely used in this country. In the U.S., there are 300 hyperbaric oxygen chambers, but in Russia, for example, there are 2000. A landmark 1971 study showed that hyperbaric oxygen treatment of 40 stroke patients produced moderate to significant improvement in 80% of patients. <p>

<br><b><a name="tinnitus">TINNITUS.</a></b> For 20 years Maria, aged 52, had suffered with ringing and rushing sounds in her ears and progressive hearing loss, a condition called tinnitus. She had also been diagnosed and treated for cholesteatoma, a condition in which cholesterol deposits form a mass inside the ear. An operation had failed to bring any improvement, but when osteopath William J. Faber, D.O., director of the Milwaukee Pain Clinic, treated her with neural/fascial therapy, she began to quickly regain her hearing in the injured ear. <p>
	Maria had injured her head in earlier accidents and had developed scar tissue from subsequent operations. Both factors led to adhesions in her ear tissue and to a restriction of the blood flow through that area; the result was a constant ringing sensation. According to Dr. Faber, scar tissue develops an “interference field” which blocks nerve impulse flow through that part of the body.<p>
	Using a tiny dental-gauge needle, Dr. Faber made a series of precise injections of anesthetic (1% or 2% procaine or 1% lidocaine) at the site of the scar tissue (left from the previous operation) in her ear. Immediately after the treatment, Dr. Faber tested the results by rubbing his hands together near her ear. Maria discovered the ringing sounds had vanished and her hearing had returned in full. “Thus, precise placement of stabilizing local anesthetics in and around nerves, blood vessels, tissues, and cells has a paramount restorative and energizing effect on the human organism,” states Dr. Faber.<p>
