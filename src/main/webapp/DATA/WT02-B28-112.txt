<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Estate Planning: It's A Fact of Life</STRONG></FONT><P>
Fact: Without proper estate planning over half the value of your estate could be lost to
federal estate taxes at death. In other words, the IRS, not your heirs, could be the single
largest beneficiary of your estate.<P>

<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pfepflim.gif" ALT="Graph" ALIGN=RIGHT  BORDER="0">
<P>
Some people think estate planning is only necessary for those select individuals who appear
in episodes of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Unfortunately, this misconception could
cost your heirs. Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for estates valued over $600,000 and can
climb as high as 60% for estates over $10,000,000 and under $21,040,000. In reality, if you
own assets, you need to plan for their future disposition. <P>
Do you need to worry about estate taxes? All too often, people underestimate the value of
their estate. Did you know that your estate includes your home, cash, investments, pension
benefits, personal property, trusts you own, alter, amend or revoke, certain life insurance
proceeds, and any other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property?
The fact is, you are generally worth more than you think.<P>

Fortunately, there are a number of strategies designed to minimize the impact of estate
taxes. The following illustrates some of the most fundamental estate planning
techniques. <P>

<STRONG>Unlimited Marital Deduction</STRONG><BR>  
The unlimited marital deduction is one of the most powerful estate planning tools available.
The Internal Revenue Code allows an unlimited amount of property to be transferred to the
surviving spouse who is a U.S. citizen tax free when the first spouse dies. Therefore, if you
are willing to pass all of your assets to your surviving spouse, there will be no federal
estate tax exposure at that time. This is an effective strategy but it is not a complete
solution to your estate planning needs. Yes, a surviving spouse will receive the assets
estate tax free, but when he or she dies the entire estate will be subject to estate taxes.
Using the unlimited marital deduction does not eliminate estate taxes, it merely defers them
- leaving your heirs, in most cases your children, with the responsibility of paying the
estate tax bill. (Different rules apply to resident alien surviving spouses.)<P>

<STRONG>Unified Tax Credit</STRONG><BR>
The unified estate and gift tax credit of $192,800 allows you to give away up to $600,000
while you are alive to anyone you want, whenever you want, gift tax free. If married, you and
your spouse can combine your credits. By properly utilizing the unified tax credit you can
decrease the value of your estate by $1.2 million and save your heirs close to $400,000 in
estate taxes.<P>
By gifting money or property while alive, the income and appreciation on the gifted assets is
not part of your estate when you die and is not subject to federal estate taxes.<P>

<STRONG>Tax-Effective Will</STRONG><BR>
A tax-effective will utilizes a combination of the unlimited marital deduction and the
unified tax credit to reduce your estate tax exposure. Here's how it works: You and your
spouse establish a special account that allows the first-to-die spouse the right to leave up
to $600,000 of assets to heirs. This special account is a credit bypass trust. The estate tax
attributed to this trust is offset by the unified credit. If properly structured, any
remaining estate balance should qualify for the unlimited marital deduction. The surviving
spouse can be an income beneficiary of the credit bypass trust, and have the right to income
from the trust for life.<P>
At the death of the second spouse, the assets in the trust can pass to your beneficiaries
without being subject to estate taxes in the surviving spouse's estate. In addition, any
appreciation of the assets in the trust will pass to your heirs tax free.<P>

<STRONG>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</STRONG><BR>
There are basically two life insurance categories: traditional and second-to-die. Traditional
insurance is term, whole life, and universal life coverage that pays a death benefit after
the insured dies. Survivorship Whole Life insurance, or second-to-die insurance, insures two
individuals in one insurance plan and pays the death benefit after the death of the second
insured.<P>

Life insurance is a cost-effective funding vehicle for an estate plan. You pay pennies on the
dollar for life insurance protection, and your heirs may use the life insurance proceeds to
pay the estate tax bill, without depleting the estate's assets. However, if you own a life
insurance policy at death, the proceeds will be included in your gross estate. To avoid this,
you need to make sure you do not own the policy when you die. Also, be sure your estate is
not the beneficiary of your life insurance proceeds.<P>

Instead, create an irrevocable life insurance trust. You would gift cash to the trust so the
trust can make the necessary premium payments. The trust applies for, owns the policy, and
pays the premiums. At death, the insurance proceeds pass into the trust and escape estate
taxes. If properly structured, the trust can also provide benefits to a surviving spouse
and/or any other beneficiaries.<P>

If you were to transfer an existing life insurance policy to an irrevocable life insurance
trust, you must live three years from the date of transfer or the value of existing policy
proceeds will be brought back into your estate. To avoid this three-year rule, you must have
an irrevocable trust or other third-party owner apply for and purchase a new policy on your
life.<P>

<STRONG>Annual Exclusion Gifts</STRONG><BR>
By gifting a portion of money and property while alive, you can dramatically reduce the size
of your taxable estate. The federal Annual Exclusion Gift Law permits you to give $10,000
each year to as many individuals as you desire. Most people choose to give such gifts to
their children and grandchildren. If married, you and your spouse can give away up to $20,000
per recipient annually. Your gifts are income tax free to your recipients and each gift may
decrease the amount your heirs will have to pay in estate taxes.<P>

As you can see, estate planning is a little like surgery. No one can expect you to understand
it all, much less perform the operation yourself. But, wouldn't you rather plan today than
have your heirs lose 37 to 60 cents on the dollar later?<P>
