  <LI>Drug testing is an effective and humane method to deter and to detect
drug 
  <LI>use. 
  <LI>Drug testing is an important tool to reduce health and workplace costs
and to 
  <LI>monitor criminal offenders. 
  <LI>Drug testing enhances safety for workplaces, schools, and transportation.

<H4>Background:</H4>
Drug-related health costs, crime, and erosion of worker productivity costs
billions of dollars annually. Drug testing is a useful tool in combating
these problems. The aim of responsible drug testing is to deter drug use
and to rehabilitate those who need help in overcoming drug problems. The
1994 American Management Association Workplace Drug Testing Survey stated
there is no doubt that drug testing is an effective method of identifying
drug users and deterring drug use in the workplace. <BR>
<H4>Rationale:</H4>
Health care costs have risen dramatically in the last decade. The escalating
epidemic of drug use has contributed to these costs. Drug-free workplace
programs reduce health care costs. Drug testing is essential to the success
of workplace programs and is a useful tool in drug treatment. Drug testing
helps break denial and disrupts addiction. <BR>
<BR>
Workers support drug-free workplace programs which include drug testing
and provide firm and compassionate education and rehabilitation. Drug testing
is effective in deterring drug use, and it has been overwhelmingly supported
by the courts. Studies indicate broad public support for workplace drug
testing. In an employment context, all positive screening tests should be
confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). <BR>
<BR>
Voluntary drug testing in schools has proven to be effective as part of
comprehensive drug prevention programs, which include education, intervention
and counseling. <BR>
<BR>
Drug testing aids law enforcement by adding new levels of flexibility and
accuracy to the detection and monitoring of drug-using offenders. Treatment
programs and probation and parole officers use drug testing to therapeutically
confront offenders. <BR>
<BR>
Drug testing is used to detect and reduce incidents of crime and drugged
driving. <BR>
<BR>
The accuracy of on-site drug testing has been well established. It has been
approved by the American Probation and Parole Association Drug Testing Guidelines.
<BR>
<BR>
Both laboratory and on-site testing are valuable tools in implementing drug
prevention, treatment, and enforcement programs, and in protecting the health
and safety of society.
