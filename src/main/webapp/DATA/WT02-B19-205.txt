<H3><CENTER> <b><I> Submitting Documents to ERIC </b></I>
</center></H3><P>
If you have recently written a paper related to the education of the gifted or of people
with disabilities, your work can be made available through ERIC.  We are interested in
receiving all types of substantive documents, including research reports, program
descriptions or evaluations, literature reviews, curriculum guides, and conference
papers.  <p>

<B> Why Submit Your Document to ERIC? </B><br>
Contributors of documents to ERIC can benefit in the following ways:
<ul><li> <b>Announcement</B>--Documents accepted by ERIC are announced to
some 2,000 organizations receiving the abstract journal <I> Resources in Education
</I> (RIE).<p>
<li> <b>Publicity</B>--Organizations that wish to sell their own documents in original
copies can announce availability and price information in RIE, thus publicizing their
product.  After the document is sold out at the original source, it is still available through
EDRS (ERIC Document Reproduction Service), if ERIC has received permission to
reproduce it.<p>
<li> <b>Dissemination</B>--Documents accepted by ERIC are reproduced on
microfiche and distributed to more than 900 groups that subscribe to the ERIC
microfiche collection. </I> <p>
<li> <b>Retrievability</B>--ERIC citations can be retrieved by the thousands of
subscribers to online information retrieval services such as Knight-Ridder (DIALOG),
OCLC, and CD+.  In addition, thousands of locations offer ERIC searches via
CD-ROM.<p>
<li> <b>Always "In Print"</B>--Once a document is on microfiche at EDRS, it never
goes out of print.  Copies can be made on an on-demand basis.</UL><p>

<B>What Kinds of Documents Can You Submit to ERIC?</B><br>
ERIC welcomes documents on nearly any aspect of education to satisfy its
broad audience, which includes teachers, administrators, supervisors, librarians,
researchers, media specialists, counselors, and every other type of educator, as well as
students and parents.  The following are examples of the types of materials ERIC
collects: <P>

ERIC has recently begun to accept nonprint materials (such as audiotapes, data files,
films, software, videotapes).  Formerly, such materials were not collected
either because they were copyrighted and could not be reproduced, or their storage
and duplication posed problems.  However, ERIC now accepts various
nonprint items, as long as they are available from a reliable source.  ERIC itself
does not reproduce or distribute such nonprint materials. <P>

<B>How Are Documents Selected for the ERIC Database?</B><br>
Documents submitted to ERIC are evaluated by subject experts according to the
following criteria:<P>

<TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=275> 
<tr><td>Substantive information (5 pages or more)</td>
<td>Contribution to knowledge </td></tr>
<tr><td>Comprehensiveness</td>
<td> Clear writing style</td></tr>
<tr><td> Timeliness</td>
<td> Sound methodology (for research)</td></tr>
<tr><td> Adequate references</td>
<td>Effectiveness of presentation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Relation to current priorities </td>
<td>Intended audience</td></tr></table> <p>

<b>Legibility and Reproducibility</B><BR>
Your documents may be typeset, typewritten, photocopied, or otherwise duplicated.  They
must be legible and easily readable.  If possible, please submit documents on standard 8" x 11" white paper. <P>

We'll need two copies of your document: one for processing into the system and
eventual filming, and one for retention and use while
processing is taking place.<P>

<B> Reproduction Release </B> <BR>
For each document you submit, we'll need a formal signed <a href="reprofrm.htm"> Reproduction
Release Form</a> indicating whether or not ERIC may reproduce the document.
