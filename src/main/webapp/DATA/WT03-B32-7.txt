COMPUTER SECURITY: HOW TO HACKER-PROOF YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS; MCI PROVIDES
TOP 10 TIPS TO HELP PROTECT COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM UNWANTED INTRUSIONS

During the holiday season, it's especially important to review the
security precautions for business computer systems that are connected to
the Internet. Ongoing reviews by MCI's Internet Security Department
indicate widespread attempts by ill-intentioned hackers to break into
business computer systems via the Internet.  With this in mind, MCI's
Internet security experts have developed some security guidelines that
will help businesses protect their systems.

"It is important for companies to do a thorough security audit of their
computer systems and to keep these systems up-to-date in order to thwart
computer hackers," said Robert Hagens, director of Internet Engineering
for MCI's Data Services Division.  "Computer hackers are constantly
sharpening their skills and inventing new schemes to break into company
computer systems.  Businesses also need to ensure that they continue to
stay one step ahead of the bad guys in securing their systems."

According to MCI's Internet Security Department, most of the successful
computer break-ins are the result of exercising old, known weaknesses in
operating systems which system administrators and managers have not
remedied.  Despite the best efforts of the Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) and others, many system operators have shown remarkable
complacence about security until they are hit by a hacker.  MCI hopes this
message will encourage more pro-active efforts by managers of systems on
the Internet.

MCI has identified the Top 10 Threats that businesses should be aware of
and the Top 10 Precautions that businesses can take to protect their
computer systems.

TOP 10 THREATS
1. FIREWALL & SYSTEM PROBING
Hackers are using sophisticated, automated tools to scan for
vulnerabilities of a company's corporate firewall and systems behind the
firewall.  These hacker tools have proved to be quite effective, with the
average computer scan taking less than three minutes to identify and
compromise security.

Companies can prevent this by ensuring that their systems sit behind a
network firewall and any services available through this firewall are
carefully monitored for potential security exposures.

2. NETWORK FILE SYSTEMS (NFS) APPLICATION ATTACKS
Hackers attempt to exploit well known vulnerabilities in the Network File
System application which is used to share files between systems.  These
attacks, usually through network firewalls, can result in compromised
administrator access.

To combat this, ensure systems do not allow NFS through the firewall, and
enable NFS protections to restrict who can access files.

3. ELECTRONIC MAIL ATTACKS
Hackers can compromise network systems by simply sending an e-mail to it.
Companies who accept e-mail from the Internet and who have exposed
versions of the sendmail program are potential targets from this attack.
Last year more than 20,000 systems were compromised due to this exposure.

To prevent this from occurring, check with vendors to ensure systems are
running a correct version of sendmail or some more secure mail product.

4. VENDOR DEFAULT PASSWORD ATTACKS
Systems of all types come with vendor installed usernames and passwords.
Hackers are well educated on these default usernames and passwords and use
these accounts to gain unauthorized administrative access to systems.

Protect systems by ensuring that all vendor passwords have been changed.

5. SPOOFING, SNIFFING, FRAGMENTATION & SPLICING ATTACKS
Recently computer hackers have been using sophisticated techniques and
tools at their disposal to identify and expose vulnerabilities on Internet
networks.  These tools and techniques can be used to capture names and
passwords, as well as compromise trusted systems through the firewall.

To protect systems from this type of attack, check with computer and
firewall vendors to identify possible security precautions.

6. SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS
Hackers will attempt to gain sensitive or confidential information from
companies by placing calls to employees and pretending to be another
employee.  These types of attacks can be effective in gaining usernames
and passwords as well as other sensitive information.

Train employees to use a "call-back" procedure to verify the distribution
of any sensitive information over the phone.

7. EASY-TO-GUESS PASSWORD COMPROMISE
Most passwords that are easy to remember are also easy to guess. These
include words in the dictionary, common names, slang words, song titles,
etc.  Computer hackers will attempt to gain access to systems using these
easy-to-guess passwords usually via automated attacks.

Protect systems by ensuring that passwords are not easy to guess, that
they are at least eight characters long, contain special characters and
utilize both uppercase and lowercase characters.

8. DESTRUCTIVE COMPUTER VIRUSES
Computer viruses can infect systems on a widespread basis in a very short
period of time.  These viruses can be responsible for erasing system data.

Protect systems from computer viruses by using anti-virus software to
detect and remove computer viruses.

9. PREFIX SCANNING
Computer hackers will be scanning company telephone numbers looking for
modem lines, which they can use to gain access to internal systems.  These
modem lines bypass network firewalls and usually bypass most security
policies.  These "backdoors" can easily be used to compromise internal
systems.

Protect against this intrusion by ensuring modems are protected from brute
force attacks.  Place these modems behind firewalls; make use of one-time
passwords; or have these modems disabled.

10. TROJAN HORSES
Hackers will install "backdoor" or "Trojan Horse" programs on businesses
computer systems, allowing for unrestricted access into internal systems,
which will bypass security monitoring and auditing policies.

Conduct regular security analysis audits to identify potential security
vulnerabilities and to identify security exposures.

TOP 10 SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
1. FIREWALL SENSITIVE SYSTEMS
Ensure corporate systems are protected from Internet attacks. Deploy a
firewall between these systems and the Internet to guard against network
scans and intrusions.

2. OBTAIN SECURITY ALERT INFORMATION
Subscribe to security alert mailing lists to identify potential security
exposures before they become problems.  CERT (Computer Emergency Response
Team at Carnegie Mellon University) is a good place to start.  The URL for
CERT's Web site is cert-advisory-requestcert.org.  The e-mail address is
certcert.org.

3. REVIEW SYSTEM AUDIT TRAILS REGULARLY
Regularly check logging data and audit trails to look for unusual or
suspicious activity.

4. BACKUP DATA
Don't be a victim of accidental or malicious data erasure. Backup all
sensitive data on a regular basis.

5. PURCHASE & DEPLOY ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
Computer viruses can spread throughout a system in minutes. Check systems
for viruses on a regular basis.

6. CHANGE PASSWORDS ON A REGULAR ROTATIONAL BASIS
Don't pick easy to remember passwords and change them often. Consider the
use of one-time password tokens to avoid password compromise threats.

7. DEPLOY VENDOR SECURITY PATCHES
Consult with vendors and obtain any system security patches that can be
used to add additional layers of protection.

8. ESTABLISH & ENFORCE A SECURITY POLICY
Develop and enforce a company-wide computer and physical security policy.

9. EMPLOYEE AWARENESS
Ensure all employees and management are briefed regularly on security
threats, policies, corrective measures and incident reporting procedures.

10. MAKE USE OF PUBLIC DOMAIN SECURITY TOOLS
A wide variety of public domain security tools exist on the Internet, many
of which can be used to assist in the protection of computer systems.

The above information was developed by MCI's Internet Security Department.

WINDOWS 95: REMOVE-IT FOR WINDOWS 95 SHIPS JANUARY 1; VERTISOFT SYSTEMS
INC. DELIVERS THE SAFEST & EASIEST WAY TO UNINSTALL APPLICATIONS IN
WINDOWS 95.

Vertisoft Systems Inc., a recognized innovator in utilities software, will
ship Remove-IT for Windows 95, a new 32-bit version of its top-rated
uninstall utility on January 1.

Remove-IT 95 is the most comprehensive removal system available to safely
and accurately remove any 32-bit or 16-bit application. Remove-IT 95 fully
supports long filenames, the Windows 95 System Registry, drag-and-drop and
other Windows 95 features.

"Users may not realize that their computers are being bombarded with
garbage until one day the whole system starts to slow down, or they begin
to run out of resources," explained Elliott Lowe, vice president/marketing
at Vertisoft Systems Inc.  "But every time you install an application, go
online, install a CD-ROM or receive a fax, you can wind up with useless
bits of electronic debris that can quickly clutter up your hard drive.
That's why you need Remove-IT 95.  It's the best way to safely clean up
that garbage and keep your system at peak performance."

Remove-IT 95 is now completing beta testing, and will be on store shelves
nationwide about January 1.  Remove-IT 95 is expected to retail for
$39.95; the retail package includes Remove-IT 95, Remove-IT 2 for Windows
3.X and the Upgrade Assistant which helps users upgrade from Windows 3.X
to Windows 95.  Registered users who purchased Remove-IT 2 at retail after
November 1 will receive a free upgrade to Remove-IT 95.  In addition,
users who purchase Remove-IT 95 between January 1 and March 30 will
receive a $10 manufacturer's mail-in rebate coupon and a certificate that
allows them to purchase Vertisoft Zip-IT or Name-IT at half-price.

Remove-IT was originally introduced in 1994; Remove-IT 95 is the third
product release in the series.  Remove-IT has consistently earned rave
reviews from editors and end users alike.  Remove-IT has also achieved
significant sales milestones, earning the No. 1 spot in PC Magazine's
retail software survey in August, 1995, and was a finalist in the 1995 MVP
Awards sponsored by PC/Computing.

NEW FEATURES IN REMOVE-IT 95
Like the award-winning Remove-IT 2, Remove-IT 95 allows users to increase
hard disk space by safely removing unnecessary applications, duplicate
files, unneeded fonts, orphan and garbage files, etc.  New and enhanced
features in Remove-IT 95 include:

Enhanced Clean-IT now tracks Cyber-Junk as a result of downloads from
online services, the Internet and received faxes.

New Move-IT function allows for easy movement of applications to any
directory or drive -- including network drives.

Enhanced Log-IT Monitor automatically records both 32-bit and 16-bit
program installations as well as changes made to the Windows System
Registry.

Enhanced Smart Disk Agent notifies users if system resources get too low,
if applications or files go unused too long, and if unneeded files get too
numerous.  Users set thresholds for each type of alert.

Find-IT and the new Find-IT Assistant locate duplicate files and help to
determine which duplicates to keep and which can be safely removed.

One of the most valuable features in Remove-IT 95, Lowe adds, is the
ability to compress an application while leaving the icon active.
Remove-IT 95's unique active application archiving saves hard disk space
by creating a compressed backup while leaving the program icon on the
desktop.  To run the application, just double-click on the icon.

Remove-IT 95 automatically retrieves it from the archive, decompresses it
on the fly, and has things ready to run in seconds. When it's time to
close the application, Remove-IT 95 offers the option of returning the
application to "cold storage" by returning it to the archive, or leaving
it decompressed and active.

Founded in 1988, Vertisoft is a leading developer and marketer of PC
utility software.  Other popular titles from Vertisoft Systems Inc.
include Remove-IT 2 (the No. 1 rated intelligent storage management
utility and uninstaller), Vertisoft Zip-IT (the easiest way to zip and
unzip files in Windows 95, Windows 3.X and Windows NT), and Name-IT (the
seamless way to use long filenames in Windows 3.X applications running
under Windows 95).  Vertisoft has licensed technology to Microsoft for use
in its operating systems, used by millions worldwide.

Vertisoft is one of the few utility software companies to offer consumers
a no-questions-asked satisfaction guarantee on its products.  Users who
are unhappy for any reason can return products within 30 days for a prompt
refund.

ANTI VIRUS: CHEYENNE SHIPS INOCULAN 1.01 FOR WINDOWS NT SERVERS &
WORKSTATION; INDUSTRY'S FIRST REAL-TIME VIRUS SCANNING FOR WINDOWS NT

Cheyenne Software, Inc., a world leader in the development of
enterprise-wide software solutions, today shipped InocuLAN 1.01 for the
Microsoft Windows NT Operating System.  This latest version of InocuLAN,
which just received the "Designed for Microsoft BackOffice" logo, is the
first product on the market with the ability to scan Windows NT based
computers for viruses in real-time. InocuLAN is the first and only
anti-virus solution to receive the "Designed for Microsoft BackOffice"
designation.

InocuLAN 1.01 sets the standard for Windows NT-based virus protection.
Like the previous version of the product (Version 1.0 - Windows NT
Magazine's Editor's Choice award, Oct.  '95), the new release is a 32-bit,
multithreaded, client/server application that protects against over 6000
viruses, including virtually all viruses 'found in the wild'.  The new
version not only scans in real-time, it is also able to scan compressed
files - allowing viruses to be detected without users having to risk
decompressing those files. InocuLAN 1.01 runs on Windows NT for Intel,
MIPS and Alpha platforms. "Windows NT Server provides a secure, reliable
operating system for distributed computing," said Rich Tong, general
manager in the business systems division at Microsoft.  "By delivering a
real-time virus detection product Cheyenne is helping further strengthen
this promise.  And because InocuLAN carries the Microsoft BackOffice logo
customers can be assured that it will integrate into their BackOffice
environment."

Behind InocuLAN's Windows 95-like interface is a state of the art,
heuristic-based, polymorphic scanner that detects nearly all known viruses
as certified by the National Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL).
InocuLAN detects, identifies and cures -- boot, file, multipartite,
stealth, polymorphic, and macro viruses.  When a virus is detected,
InocuLAN notifies the user immediately, as well as sends an alert via
Microsoft Mail, alphanumeric pager, SNMP, network broadcast, fax, or
printed trouble ticket.  InocuLAN maintains a detailed activity log of all
virus scans across the network.  The product also records to the Windows
NT system event log.

InocuLAN 1.01 for Windows NT is unique in that it allows administrators to
manage an entire network of InocuLAN hosts from a central Windows NT
Server or Workstation.  Unlike competitive products, it is implemented as
a service that can provide enterprise-wide remote management, including
unattended remote virus scans, even when the remote workstation is not
logged into the network.  In addition, InocuLAN further integrates with
Microsoft BackOffice by supporting long file names and Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) and is Unicode compliant.  InocuLAN utilizes a kernel
mode device driver to allow it to scan incoming and outgoing files in
real-time.

"Cheyenne's expertise in providing enterprise tools allows us to take the
lead in helping administrators deploy anti-virus measures across the
enterprise", said Rei Jane Huai, president and CEO for Cheyenne Software.
"Cheyenne will continue to work closely with Microsoft to make BackOffice
a secure environment and to support mission critical applications."

Cheyenne Software, Inc. is an international developer of essential
software solutions for NetWare, Windows NT, UNIX, Macintosh and OS/2
networks.  Its enterprise-wide offerings include an array of storage
management, security and communications products, including Cheyenne HSM,
JETserve, InocuLAN, FAXserve, Monitrix and its flagship product line, the
ARCserve family of network backup software.  Cheyenne can be contacted at
(800) 243-9462 (US or Canada) or (516) 282-5110.

VIRTUAL OFFICE: FOR BUSINESSMEN CONSTANTLY ON THE GO: CHICAGO COMPANY
CREATES FIRST VIRTUAL OFFICE FOR THEIR NEEDS

There is nothing like the Office Club.

They are opening all over the country.  They will have local virtual
offices (not necessary though because a client never visits the Office
Club).  Here's how it works:

You are assigned an e-mail number, voice mail box and fax number.
Hypothetically, you are a national sales manager for a company that is
based in New York and you are in San Francisco.  You can e-mail the Office
Club with copy for a new contract that needs to go to a prospective
customer.  They will type, overnight, fax or e-mail (serve as your
office).  There is no need to talk with the Office Club; everything can be
done by e-mail.  A copy of the contract is e-mailed back to your mailbox
so you know it has been done.  The Office Club customer messages and faxes
are e-mailed to the customer.

The Office Club home page has doors assigned to different services:
hotels, restaurants, voice mail, e-mail, fax, airlines. The client opens
the home page door to one of these services and e-mails to the Office Club
which will arrange (like their office would do), receive e-mail, make a
hotel reservation, etc.

Al Misale, founder, has taken a HQ concept or a home office and made it
virtual/interactive.

CHIPS: CYRIX TO WRITE OFF 486 PROCESSOR INVENTORY; COMPANY TO FOCUS EFFORT
ON FLAGSHIP 6X86 PROCESSOR FOR 1996

Cyrix Corp. will report a loss for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 1995, due
to poor pricing and sales of 486 products and a write-off of remaining 486
inventory.

While the amount of the fourth quarter loss has not been determined, the
company expects that it could exceed $0.40 per share. Cyrix reported net
income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1995, of $25.5 million, or
$1.28 per share.

"While this first-time loss for Cyrix is a tremendous disappointment, and
it will put us into default of covenants contained in our credit
agreements, we have taken action to close out the 486 business and begin
1996, a year that will depend almost entirely on the market strength of
the 6x86 processor," said Cyrix President and Chief Executive Officer
Jerry Rogers.  "We can now concentrate on producing and selling as many
6x86 processors as possible in 1996."

Cyrix Corp., headquartered in Richardson, is a leading supplier of
high-performance processors to the personal computer industry. Founded in
1988, the company designs, manufactures and markets innovative, x86
software-compatible processors for the desktop and mobile computer
markets.

The financial report of company operations for the Dec. 31, 1995, quarter
will be distributed on Jan. 18, 1996, after the close of the market.

INTERNET ACCESS: NETSCAPE ADOPTS EXCITE FOR ITS NET DIRECTORY; EXCITE
SERVICE REPLACES YAHOO!

Architext Software, Inc., Thursday announced that Netscape Communications,
Inc. has adopted Excite for its Internet directory services.

This means that users clicking the "Net Directory" button of the Netscape
browser will be directly linked to the Excite media navigation service.

Excite was launched in early October of this year as the first
next-generation media navigation service.  It combines a concept-based
search engine with a full complement of net reviews which are developed by
a team of thirty or so editors all working together in a "virtual
newsroom." Since the launch of Excite, Architext acquired City.Net for
local and regional media navigation and has added many features, including
the Internet's first interactive political cartoon series, which was
launched in its beta form in November.

"The power of the Net is not just to connect people with miscellaneous
pieces of data, but to connect people with people, people with content,
and content with people," said Joe Kraus, Architext founder and president.
"We are confident that this Netscape relationship will enable our service
to connect even more people and content."

Kraus said Excite is currently experiencing about two million hits a day,
with the number increasing rapidly.

Based in Mountain View, CA, Architext Software, Inc., is the first company
to offer a next generation Media Navigation Service. Architext was founded
in 1993 and is funded by a combination of corporate investment and venture
capital.

Investors include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Institutional Venture
Partners, Charles Rivers Ventures and International Data Group.  Excite
can be located on the Internet at http://www.excite.com.

WINDOWS 95: VERTISOFT ZIP-IT SHIPS JANUARY 1; POWERFUL NEW UTILITY FOR
WINDOWS 95 & WINDOWS 3.X ELIMINATES FILE COMPRESSION DRUDGERY

Vertisoft Systems Inc., the recognized innovator in utilities software,
has begun shipments of Vertisoft Zip-IT, the easiest way to zip and unzip
files in Windows 95, Windows 3.X and Windows NT.  Many files can be
reduced in size by as much as 98 percent -- a big savings in hard drive
space or upload/download time.

"Anyone who uses online services or the Internet knows that file
compression is an absolute necessity," says Elliott Lowe, vice
president/marketing at Vertisoft Systems Inc.  "Until now, however, file
compression was anything but simple.  Vertisoft Zip-IT changes that.
Zip-IT represents a tremendous advance in the ease-of-use for file
compression utilities.  There's nothing like it available anywhere else."

Vertisoft Zip-IT will be on store shelves nationwide about January 1,
1996, and is expected to retail for $39.95.  In a special promotion during
January, February and March, 1996, users who purchase Vertisoft's
Remove-IT 95 at retail (expected street price: $39.95) can purchase Zip-IT
for half-price.

VERTISOFT ZIP-IT
Vertisoft Zip-IT makes managing compressed files simple.  No other file
compression utility is as comprehensive and easy-to-use. Zip-IT
automatically adds itself to the Windows 95 Explorer and the Windows 3.X
File Manager interface, so file compression, viewing or extraction is a
simple point-and-click operation.

Vertisoft Zip-IT lets users view files within any archive without having
to extract them.  For the first time, users can view, edit or even run
files that are still zipped.  "Users familiar with old-fashioned DOS-based
compression utilities are amazed when they see Zip-IT," Mr. Lowe adds.
"Everything is a simple point-and-click operation.

"You can work with multiple ZIP files at the same time.  If you want to
get a single file out of an entire ZIP archive, just point-and-click on
the file you want.  And if you need to work with extra-large files, just
use Zip-IT's Span Disk feature to automatically back up zipped archives
across multiple diskettes."

VERTISOFT ZIP-IT GIVES USERS:
o Simple drag-and-drop file compression.

o Exclusive Zip-IT Plus feature to create self-extracting ZIP files that
are executable under Windows and DOS -- so co-workers and friends don't
need their own file compression utility.

o 100% compatibility with the PKZIP standard, so users can unzip files
with PKZIP or Zip-IT, regardless of which application was used to zip
them.

o View, edit and run zipped files from within Vertisoft Zip-IT. Zip-IT
includes a built-in viewer or allows access to Windows 95's QuickView.

o Point-and-click file unzipping.

o Integration with the Windows 3.X File Manager or Windows 95 Explorer.

o A built-in Search feature to help locate files inside the ZIP files on
your hard drive in a flash.

o Zip Options menu to let users customize the way files are archived.

Founded in 1988, Vertisoft is a leading developer and marketer of PC
utility software.  Other popular titles from Vertisoft Systems Inc.
include Remove-IT 2 (the No. 1 rated intelligent storage management
utility and uninstaller), Remove-IT 95 (the most comprehensive removal
system available to safely and accurately remove any 32-bit or 16-bit
application), and Name-IT (the seamless way to use long filenames in
Windows 3.X applications running under Windows 95).  Vertisoft has
licensed technology to Microsoft for use in its operating systems, used by
millions worldwide.

Vertisoft is one of the few utility software companies to offer consumers
a no-questions-asked satisfaction guarantee on its products.  Users who
are unhappy for any reason can return products within 30 days for a prompt
refund.
