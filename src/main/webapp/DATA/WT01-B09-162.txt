<P>Under phase 2 of the Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Demonstration Program 16 vehicles
will be added to the Comonwealth's existing EV Beet of 20. The original 20 have been in
operation under his program for 2 years. This program is unique because the state leases
He vehicles to commuters for every day use.</P>

funded through ARPA. Like in Phase 1 these vehicles mull be leased to commuters. It is
expected these vehicles will travel 100 miles between charges.</P>

<P>The Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources, issued an RFP for these vehicles in
April, they hope to have them on the road by August.</P>

In addition to funding from APRA, the Massachusetts Electric Vehicles Program is funded
<P>through The Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources, Federal Highway Adm.,
Massachusetts Highway Dept., Boston Edison company Commonweal Electric and
Massachusetts Electric.</P>
