<h4>CHAPTER FOUR</h4>

<h3>THE EXILE'S RE-RETURN</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1963</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once more I wandered through the gigantic city of
New York, and the busy arteries of Manhattan and its mighty
Central Park. It was January. And it felt good to be back. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had had quite a few new ideas since leaving
Harvard about extending the availability of LSD to new groups,
organisations, and selected individuals, which might lead to
locating space for the psychedelic experience in modern American
society. It was clear that if psychedelics were to enter into
proper competition for society's mandate, we would need some kind
of structure to disseminate our new knowledge. The need for a
legal framework into which psychedelics could be smoothly fitted
was very great indeed, for non-medical use of these drugs,
including LSD, was <i>not</i> yet governed by the Food and Drug
Act&#151;and if we were to use our legal advantages in a
collaborative way, and fast, we might be able to get a project
off the ground and circulating through inner space before the law
finally got round to outlawing their use or amended the Act to
prevent their use for religious purposes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An American legal authority, Roy C. Bates, writing
about 'Psychedelics and the Law'&#151;what he called 'A Prelude
in Question Marks'&#151;comments on the situation of about this
time, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It may seem far-fetched but would be altogether in accord
    with the (Federal) Constitution to organise a group as a
    church, with the prospect of privilege.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he based this observation on a decision by the
Honourable Yale McFate in 1960 in favour of a member of the
Navajo Indian Tribe appealing a charge of illegal possession of
peyote, a sacramental food of the Native American Church. There
was also another Navajo-peyote case on the books: it was decided
on July 26, 1962, by the United States District Court of Appeals,
District of Columbia Circuit (Washington), to declare a section
of the Code of Indian Tribal Offences&#151;'Peyote Violations'
'null and void, invalidly authorised and unconstitutional'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As to such religious practices, William Blake (b.
1757) has this to say: 'I then asked Ezekiel why he ate dung, and
lay so long on his right side and left side. He answered, 'The
desire of raising other men into a perception of the infinite;
this the North American tribes' practice.' <i>(The Marriage of
Heaven and Hell).</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bates also noted that </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Inner space law today (1963) is in the stage of
    underdevelopment outer space law was in A.D. 1903 when the
    Brothers Wright launched their airplane at Kittyhawk or,
    perhaps, when the Brothers Montgolfier ascended in the first
    air balloon, a hundred years earlier. Until it has matured,
    scholars in search of external on behalf of internal freedom
    will feel frustrated. They may believe themselves to be
    fugitives from injustice but in truth are victims of legal
    confusion engendered by the reversal of scientific objects,
    from the universe without to the universe within. Until
    psychedelics have found their place in law, a good many
    concrete questions will not be answerable with confidence.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Leary had also taken note of the legal
uncertainty surrounding the use of psychedelic substances, and
working independently in Cambridge, Mass., started a unique
organization called 'IFIF' (International Federation for Internal
Freedom) to preach the gospel that man's salvation lies in the
expansion of his own consciousness&#151;that the fruits, which
hitherto have fallen only to the lot of him who renounces the
world, can now be shared by him who partakes of the LSD
sacrament, and that, no matter how little happiness can be
regarded as the goal of individual human aspiration, it is yet
the best means to its attainment. They sited the IF-IF offices on
Storey Street&#151;two blocks from Harvard Square. 'We welcome
anyone interested,' Alpert wrote in <i>The Harvard Crimson.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Alpert continued to conduct his course in
motivation at Harvard for undergraduates and graduates, and Leary
taught his graduate seminars in research methods, IF-IF staff
took care of enquiries, official correspondence, and mailing
packets of literature to Harvard undergraduates, graduate
students, faculty and anyone interested anywhere in the country.
There was an application blank for membership in IF-IF (dues $10
per year), an 'Agreement to Indemnify and Hold Harmless'. </p>

<p><center> AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS</center></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For good and valuable consideration, including
access to the literature and other facilities of the
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INTERNAL FREEDOM, its agents,
servants, associates and employees, I agree to indemnify the said
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INTERNAL FREEDOM, its agents,
servants, associates and employees, and save them harmless for
any loss, damage or expenses arising from the claim and demand of
any person against the INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INTERNAL
FREEDOM, its agents, servants, associates or employees, in
connection with the use of LSD, psilocybin and related drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have read the information concerning these drugs
and substances and understand that they are classified for
investigational use. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; DATE: ........................&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .............................. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WITNESS: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; .................................... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And messages from the Cambridge headquarters
began to move along the system, telling the news, of odd
happenings in Mexico, how 'Internal Freedom' is going to be like
Zen this year, and of 'several million thoughtful people who have
heard the joyous tidings and who are waiting patiently for their
psychedelic moment to come', for whom LSD is becoming a major
religious and civil rights controversy. It was a brilliant
astonishing concept, even by eccentric New England standards, and
deserved all the support it could get; indeed, it seemed for some
of its membership to offer the umbrella under which they could
enjoy their psychedelic experiences without much spiritual or
financial outlay. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But even in the hands of Tim, the eternal juggler,
things began crashing about their heads as 'news' about IF-IF
circulated in the media and through casual gossip, which may or
may not have been true but was certainly extravagant,
contradictory, scandalous, libelous, comic and inspirational. An
IF-IF-Los Angeles opened for the West Coast. Alpert and Leary
went on radio in Boston to explain their mission. Television
networks were becoming interested, and 'experimental
multifamilial living' using psychedelics began to spring up in
different parts of America, along the lines of Tim's model for
'transpersonative, transcendental communities' where family
members could 'maintain a level of experience which cuts beyond
routine ego and social games'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alpert, Tim and his young daughter and son, a
married Harvard senior with wife and baby, and several friends
had themselves already started one such multi-familial dwelling,
in a house they bought in the Newton suburb of Boston. In it
there was a specially constructed 'meditation room' accessible
from the cellar solely by a rope ladder. The only furnishings
were mattresses covered in Indian prints, with drapes billowing
down from the ceiling like Tibetan clouds, and huge Afghani
cushions on the floor. A tiny oil-lamp gave just enough
illumination to see the Buddha statue in the corner. The
fragrance of incense completed the effect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in the rich middle-class Boston dovecote of
Newton, the goings-on at the house had become a source of
irritation amongst neighbours, including one lady who had lived
for thirty-two years in a house near Dr. Alpert's green
ten-bedroom home. 'Some weekends,' she complained to one
reporter, 'their house is like a motel. They all wear a beatnik
uniform&#151;tight pants and jerseys, no shoes or stockings. One
young man in his twenties is letting his blond hair grow down to
his shoulders and every time I look at him I want to vomit.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally the families got together for a petition
and invoked a Newton statute which allows only one-family
dwellings in the neighbourhood. There was a hearing before the
planning board in which the colonists were represented by
Alpert's father, George Alpert, former president of the New Haven
Railroad and a distinguished member of the Massachusetts bar,
with his own law firm in Boston. The elder Alpert pointed out
that the law does not specify that families must be
consanguiness. And with that he won the case; there was no
further trouble from neighbours after that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nonetheless, all this, and events back at the IF-IF
offices, used up a lot of psychic energy in those of us committed
to keep the game going. It seemed that the best plan would be to
dissolve the corporate legal structure and announce that from
henceforth IFIF members could make their own way in the
world&#151;just their bodies and a willingness to stay 'on the
way', very much as in Hermann Hesse's <i>The Journey to the East.</i>
Accordingly, the organisation's board met to formulate the
closing-up operation and to send its members the terminating
Statement of Purposes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was all played as another conscious move in the
cosmic 'bead-game'&#151;Remove the old 'set' and <i>avoid</i>
setting up a new structure, and you have a brand new movie:
'IF-IF will have no members, no budget, no dues, no officers, no
meetings. It is now an anonymous system; not secret, not public,
but private. The term &quot;IF-IF&quot; no longer stands for
International Federation for Internal Freedom. It symbolises the
&quot;ecstatic process&quot; as the endpoint of any game or as a
point of the no-game experience.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The basic notion was to aim at some loose
association in being identified as 'wayfarers', but without any
kind of specific structure anymore, a 'move' that guaranteed both
end and start in one. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was absolutely unique. Once understood, all
manner of varieties and variations could be introduced....
Everybody has to find the way for himself, but can send messages
and cues from his own voyage, like internal cosmographers
charting new internal seas of experience and perhaps pointing out
sensory landmarks yet no prescription, no rigid principles, for
action. Total Autonomy Always . . . Just a message here and
there, or a particular quotation or a description of an
experience or exposure of getting stuck in a particular game, all
with the general purpose of raising the general tenor of people's
lives with the ultimate goal that of complete self-liberation. In
the lines immortalised by Bobby Dylan on the 'Lay Lady Lay' track
of <i>Nashville Skyline</i>&#151;'You can have your cake and eat
it too.' Yeah ! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The new IF-IF offered entry into a psychedelic
paradise of delights with the price of admission only your own
head. IF-IF was now free to develop its religious aspirations in
the direction of the most ideally minded&#151;the great American
youth, by suggesting people who take psychedelics are destined to
give that spiritual content to modern life. IF-IF was a church
you associated with bringing you up, not down; the new religion
was something associated with getting high. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One professor of psychology was very enthusiastic
to propose new techniques and complex in-field play: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Perhaps one could start with or on the IF-IF members as
    the natural audience and introduce the notion through the
    news letter, then encourage everybody to send in a
    return-addressed and stamped envelope. This would reduce the
    cost. Also send out all material in duplicate, with the
    instruction to give one copy to an interested friend. That
    would snowball the development. Also, initially perhaps the
    comic Zen koans ought to be relatively simple yet not too
    easy. Something in the nature of different languages,
    references to significant passages or books, or records, or
    anything. It is important to get people involved through
    action, they have to work to solve the koans. Then, gradually
    . . . one could make it more difficult, and more in
    &quot;code&quot;&#151;you could circulate original
    &quot;manifestos&quot; analysing possible game hang-ups and
    traps in society; and you can build up a body of references
    one can allude to. Then make it gradually more difficult to
    obtain information, so that one would have to go through
    several persons and piece things together. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'To meditate on a type of koan is a great idea.
    Set up a master file to collate correspondence, but keep
    everything cosmically anonymous. A lot of disguising and
    metamorphosis, using code names, etc. The whole thing ought
    to lead to a spiritual revolution in which everybody works
    for his own enlightenment, which will come to him in his own
    way through his own effort, carried by the feeling of
    participation in a brotherhood, yet without legislation and
    direct advice or feeding, which necessarily leads to control.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'All this seems like a natural evolution from
    IF-IF that utilised accepted social games for its dialogue or
    &quot;duel&quot; with established social structures. But the
    previous effort is not the way to fight it. In doing so, we
    submit implicitly to their rules. We have to find new rules
    which transcend the old ones without direct conflict, but we
    have to play on our own terms and have the others adjust to
    finding out what we are up to. Not that we really have to
    know&#151;as a matter of fact we can't know, because the idea
    is to keep everything in flux and go beyond the structures as
    soon as they are built and have been used once. Transcending
    is being elusive but in a marvelous sense. (Socratic irony.)
    If we state fixed goals&#151;other than personal, unique
    enlightenment&#151;we set ourselves up for being attached,
    shot at. The secret is that &quot;the way itself&quot; or
    &quot;being on the way&quot;, is its own goal, which means
    you have to keep changing as you go along. Only the
    here-and-now counts&#151;the here-and-now which is anyway
    pregnant with future and past (although it is wrong to <i>worry</i>
    about that). Complete responsive surrender to the challenge
    of the moment is equal to complete transcendence. Following
    the call and tuning in on the demands that present
    themselves; reading the signs of the way through the jungle;
    being in tune with nature and responding to it, rather than
    trying to redo everything in one's own image; trying to
    impose one's own game on to things, people, events: only this
    leads to liberation, I think. So every event, every
    manifestation of being, stands on its own terms and wants to
    be understood as such. One can only serve as the guardian of
    being, as the custodian of phenomena, to let oneself be swept
    up and carried away. There need be no questions asked:
    affirmation and acceptance ! <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But people are phobic about
    &quot;drugs&quot;&#151;a strange phenomenon unto
    itself&#151;and they rationalise about &quot;artificial&quot;
    and &quot;short-cuts&quot;, etc. If we could use gimmicks and
    natural disciplines like sensory isolation, movie techniques,
    and explore other techniques, meditation, what have you, in
    order to effect some kind of loosening up and ecstatic sweep
    or upsurge&#151;then it would be easy to convince people
    about the value of &quot;shortcuts&quot;. This effort would
    allay their fear. Not that we need to worry about convincing
    people, but to point out to them various possibilities for
    them to consider. All arguing about pros and cons seems
    futile. One should report on events, give messages about
    where we are, what we see, what there is to behold.
    Persuasion is not needed, but affirmation and signposts,
    which manifest their own persuasive power on those who are
    interested. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I also hope we can write and tape a few
    programmed Perhaps one could interest a record company in
    cutting a few discs and distributing them. The communications
    network could be a powerful influence on tastes. The
    meditation-room idea is gaining wide recognition
    here&#151;everybody should build one. There will be
    tremendous need for meditation guides as well as manuals for
    trips. All this is very exciting and I hope we can talk about
    it soon. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'There is a &quot;magic theatre&quot; wherever
    you look, if you can only relax and forget about yourself as
    an actor caught in a net struggling to get out. Total
    involvement and total detachment at the same time, which
    sounds paradoxical but it seems a desirable and realisable
    ideal, the 100 per centness, here and now, which makes every
    moment (even of deadliest routine) seem like a totally new
    experience merely by letting yourself be addressed each time
    anew.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Doctor Strangelove, indeed . . . But it was left to
the Grand Master and High Priest Tim, to explain how, in future,
messages (verbal and non-verbal) were to be found in the seed
that lies at the core of each one of us. He wrapped it up in his
own esoteric way&#151;'IF-I F is conservative&#151;it seeks to
return to the wisdom of the tribe, to the wisdom of the body, to
the wisdom of the nervous system.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was all perhaps just a problem of 'unicornity',
for Hermann Hesse had written of the pilgrimage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Throughout the centuries it had been on the way, towards
    the light and wonder, and each member, each group, indeed our
    whole host and its great pilgrimage, was only a wave in the
    eternal stream of human beings, of the eternal strivings of
    the human spirit towards the East, towards Home. The
    knowledge passed through my mind like a ray of light and
    immediately reminded me of the phrase which I had learned
    during my novitiate year, which always pleased me immensely
    without my realising its full significance. It was a phrase
    by the poet Novalis, &quot;Where are we really going? Always
    home!&quot; ' (The <i>Journey to the East</i>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in a practical way, IF-IF&#151;if, IF!&#151;had
anticipated Marshall McLuhan's theoretical basis for what
lysergised nervous systems believe about non-verbal, i.e.
telepathic, communication: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Tribal man is tightly sealed in an integral collective
    awareness that transcends conventional boundaries of time and
    space. As such, the new society will be one mythic
    integration, a resonating world akin to the old tribal echo
    chamber where magic will live again: a world of ESP....
    Electricity makes possible&#151;and not in the distant
    future, either&#151;an amplification of human consciousness
    on a world scale, without any verbalisation at all.' (<i>Playboy</i>
    interview). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something similar happened to us in New York, where
a parallel development was simultaneously taking place at the
offices of The Agora Scientific Trust, Inc., on the corner of
Eighty-First Street between Madison and Park Avenues. It was only
in New York City the game possibilities were different, that's
all; it required a different scenario, new players, a fresh
response to the organisation possibilities inherent in our new
situation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Agora was to be a living metaphor for the kind of
idea-sharing an LSD session entails. In our 'Statement of
Purposes' a group of us introduced a theoretical model for Agora
as a Foundation for Mind Research, and wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the seventeenth century Rene Descartes advanced the
    theory that the body is a machine and is subject to the same
    investigational techniques that we apply to the natural
    sciences. In contrast, he considered the human mind to be of
    immaterial and supernatural design, linked to the body by
    means of some unknown divine fiat. The ramifications of
    Cartesian dualism were to provide all areas of Western
    science with the result that today the body is accorded
    extensive study and scientific analysis whereas those aspects
    of human life which are identified with the mind have been
    greatly neglected by experimental scientists. The tremendous
    advances of modern biology and medicine are the direct
    products of the great progress made in the knowledge of the
    body-machine which have resulted from the mechanistic
    procedures initiated by Descartes. On the other hand, these
    same procedures have had a debilitating effect on the study
    of the phenomenon of consciousness thereby seriously
    curtailing the studies related to the problem of life. Since
    biologists tend to extend the machine paradigm to living
    organisms, they neglect the phenomena not found in machines.
    Qualitative change is needed in the pattern of our studies if
    we are to discern an enlarged meaning of nature and of man
    extending beyond mathematical and experimental analysis of
    sensory phenomena and human behaviour. We believe, finally,
    that man has reached a crisis in consciousness within which
    he has the choice to continue in the path of the growing
    technicisation of human nature or to enter upon an intensive
    and comprehensive investigation of mind and its creative
    process in the pursuit of a greater use of human potential
    and a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In recent years, there have arisen groups of
    social scientists and psychologists who have striven to fill
    the existing vacuum in the study of consciousness. Guided by
    the successes of the natural scientists they have applied
    mechanistic attitudes to the study of mind and have sought to
    understand their subject in terms of behavioural controls and
    biological-drive modalities. In so doing, they have carried
    the theory of body-mind dualism to its logical and dangerous
    conclusion so that today we are faced with a growing tyranny
    of behaviouristic and mechanistic procedures applied to the
    exploration of human potentiality. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We are a group of scientists and researchers
    who wish to move beyond our own scientific tyranny. We have
    ceased to be intoxicated with technological proficiency. We
    cannot endorse a mechanistic interpretation of human
    behaviour that reduces the mind-brain problem to a
    materialistic monism. We believe that the current
    over-emphasis on mechanism has produced a dislocation of
    vision, one that is resulting in a de-humanisation of
    knowledge and a de-humanisation of man. We believe that an
    investigation into the nature and potential of mind, a
    dynamic consideration of the range and chemistry of
    consciousness, the utilisation and evaluation of new and old
    techniques of intensifying and extending the mind's
    apprehension of its reality&#151;this is the substance of the
    research programme that is the Foundation for Mind Research.'
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to myself, there were two other
directors, John Beresford, M.D. (a long-term friend from the old
London days of the fifties, who now lived in New York), and Jean
Houston, Ph.D., a young, beautiful woman with two Off-Broadway
acting awards and an impressive list of academic involvements and
interests (Instructor in Comparative Religion and Philosophy of
Religion, Columbia University; Instructor in Philosophy, Hunter
College; Associate Professor in Philosophy and Religion, The New
School for Social Research; author of <i>The Varieties of
Religious Experience: A Re-evaluation of the James Work in the
Light of Modern Psychological Theory,</i> and <i>Tragedy In an
Age of Scepticism</i>&#151;and was later to co-author with Bob
Masters <i>The Varieties of the Psychedelic Experience,</i> a
work based largely on her experiments at Agora, where she was
guide to many intensive LSD sessions). And to help and advise us,
we gathered an impressive group of active 'research affiliates',
including Victor Lownes as our 'Tantric' consultant, a position
he filled&#151;or fulfilled admirably. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The set-up on Eighty-First Street was tasteful,
cosy, well-equipped, and expensive; we rented the floor-through
garden apartment in a private building with three rooms, toilet
and bath, and a tiny tree-shaded garden at the back. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By chance or by good fortune&#151;or it may even
have been by magic&#151;we had discovered in Howard Teague, the
Nassau millionaire, that rarest of cultural beings, the patron.
He had understood our needs and made the acquisition of the
property and furnishings possible, in a very open and generous
way. All we had to do in return was keep in touch and maybe visit
him in Nassau now and again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The large centre room fronting the garden was our
'session-room'. No interior decorator ever devised this
psychedelic paradise of Swedish six-inch pile rugs and huge,
canvas 'mandalas' on ceiling and walls, but once inside you
dissolved all normal barriers of consciousness and flowed off
into the well of infinity. We had been on a spending spree during
the first few hectic days of getting the place ready&#151;a hi-fi
sound system with tape-deck and two speakers; a stroboscope; a
machine for emitting sub-audible (low-frequency) sound waves; and
a 'synchrotron', a device which delivers sound to the right and
left ears alternately. This room was also my bedroom <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The front 'office' had a couple of desks,
telephones, chairs, electric typewriters, small bar and cabinet,
a miniature FBI-type wire recorder, things like that, but was
nonetheless decorated in the conventional Manhattan office style,
without anyone ever actually using it, except possibly as a place
to smoke dope (very illegal in those days!) if there were
otherwise straight subjects undergoing a session in the other
rooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first, most of the planning and programming was
shared by Jean Houston and myself, each with our own little slot
to fill or speciality to develop. Jean was curious about what she
called 'Phylogenetic recall', the proposition by Jung that
in-built in the psychology of modern man there exist archetypes
related to the early history of the human race. She was
interested in setting up drug-related experimental designs and a
foolproof methodology of administration of long-term and
short-term psychedelics, most particularly the administration of
LSD-25, psilocybin, Dimethyl- and Diethyl-tryptamine, which we
had at the office in large supply; and, for myself, the question
of my role in Agora is a bit academic since I was both artist and
spectator at one with it and myself at the same time, though I
remember I used to write memoranda quite a lot and papers,
doubtlessly altogether quite meaningless, with titles such as
'Multicentricity and Incongruity; Epistemological Significance of
Recent Findings in Research Using LSD-25' and 'Experiments in
Thought Acceleration using Psilocybin' and 'The Nature of the
Subjective LSD Experience', all of which was, admittedly, pretty
didactic stuff compared to IF-IF, but nonetheless rather funny
and inspired for all that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In our psychedelic yellowstone we had found food
for both the lion (science) and the unicorn (fantasy/myth/magic),
even if in the end we could not persuade them, for all the
correctness of our opinions, to lie down together. What we had
tried to do was to blend new concepts and theoretical
frameworks&#151;utilising such diverse areas as the geometry and
energy dynamics of molecular 'flowing' structure to biochemistry,
genetics, vision, memory, and accelerated learning: Yes, ethical
and moral practice, too&#151;with all the magical arts, including
the 'I Ching', 'Quabhalla', The Tarot pack, and Alchemy, in order
to shed new light on what webelieved was a crisis in the 'Order'
and 'Symbolisation' in Western civilisation. I suppose you could
say that our orientation was humanistic. Our 'humane science'
aimed towards a simultaneous description of Man from multiple
points of view, which itself is nothing more than the
multidisciplinary understanding of the way mind and matter work
in man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Julian Huxley, from London, wrote, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the psychedelic drugs we have a remarkable opportunity
    for interesting research. Nobody else, so far as I know, has
    done any work on different types of psychologically healthy
    and normal people&#151;people of high or low IQ, of different
    backgrounds, of different affective dispositions, on
    verbalisers and visualisers. This would be of extraordinary
    interest: we might find out not merely how to utilise our
    mind more energetically and more dynamically, but how to
    promote creativity by enhancing the creative imagination.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as a research area, the psychedelic experience
was baffling for most researchers, whose speciality was
'compartmentalized' and who could not visualise the possibility
of a 'whole', when perhaps even a new branch of knowledge would
have to be developed to embrace new claims, concepts, as happened
in mathematics with the discoveries of quantum mechanics and
relativity theories, which revolutionized our understanding of
the forces at work in the external world but which have yet to be
integrated into a unified field theory of modern conceptual
knowledge. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In modern America in 1963, the available literature
looked more frightful than fruitful. Perhaps understandably, the
revolutionary impact of psychedelics was not recognised during
the early period of research. Occasional glimpses were found, but
the majority of reports suggest that the researchers describing
their results were seriously biased by their existing frames of
reference. A carry-over of former conceptual systems into the
radically new experience provided by these drugs inevitably
caused distortions in interpretation of the material covered.
Thus, while the work of the British psychiatrist, Dr. Humphrey
Osmond, concerning the biochemical nature of schizophrenia was
furthered by the introduction of LSD <i>et al</i>. during the
mid-1950s, at the same time psychedelic theory itself was not
advanced. It was in fact restricted into a pre-existing mould by
the unconscious association that came to be made between
psychedelic drugs and mental illness, which subsequently proved
to be as erroneous as it was misleading. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, even in restricted scientific research,
sometimes something could happen to provide a valuable
psychedelic programme. In the field of treatment of alcoholism,
for one, there were several studies showing a close to fifty per
cent (one in two) control rate following 'LSD therapy', a figure
which cannot be matched by any other therapeutic approach to this
problem, and successful beyond the wildest dreams of Alcoholics
Anonymous, to say nothing of conventional psychoanalysis, which
has a success rate of curing alcoholics of about one in every
hundred, which is nobody. Or on another part of the
investigational spectrum, Dr. R. A. Sandison, a Canadian
psychiatrist, has reported the emergence of archetypal material
during psychedelic sessions, lending weight to the hypotheses of
C. G. Jung. Then there were a number of 'naturalistic' studies
from different schools of thought, artistic and otherwise, as
well as all the Harvard reports when subjects reported states of
consciousness, variously described in terms of transcendental
experience, i.e. visionary, mind-manifesting,
consciousness-expanding. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, a lot of research had been done with
psychedelics, by comparison with perhaps every other important
area of research, the total volume was minute. At the same time,
it was also becoming increasingly evident that there were
deficiencies in the published work which existed, and, curiously,
there had been little if any advance during the previous two to
three years over projects well under way before the 1960s. For
example, a review of the position by the psychologists Terrill,
Savage and Jackson, published in November, 1962, but dating from
a round-table conference in January, 1960, is <i>not</i>
essentially different from reports published in 1954 and 1956.
There were grounds for believing that the main factor which
stimulated the widespread interest in psychedelics, which
characterized the period of the mid-1950s, was the belief that,
through their use, long-standing problems in psychiatry were
about to be settled; further, that with the abandoning of this
hope a general decline of interest became noticeable in
psychiatric circles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were even disagreements between some of the
developing 'psychedelic theoreticians'. John Beresford, for one,
believed that what he called 'the Leary attitude' results from </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'a static, unidirectional, relatively fixed set of
    preconceptualisations of entity caused by and arising from
    deep psychological disturbances, displaced on to and hence
    &quot;derealising&quot; a potentially dangerous drug. The
    error stems fundamentally from passive-receptive tendencies
    on part of erstwhile principal investigators, causing
    passive, permissive attitude during the highly suggestible
    LSD-state, criminally neglecting to acquaint the subject with
    the essential knowledge, that he can always control whatever
    his mind is involved with, rendering the subject helpless,
    and at times, extremely fearful.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beresford was a proponent of the counter-theory
that the LSD experience is a bi-phasic phenomenon: You must act,
as well as feel; decide, as well as submit; allow out, as well as
in. He felt quite strongly that LSD provided the </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>'only</i> curative hope for the &quot;crisis of
    civilisation&quot; type of malfunctioning', and that 'the
    cure can be summed up in the one word
    &quot;integration&quot;; and that integration requires
    activation of both self and image store. Leary fails
    miserably because total resistlessness in the end saps
    strength, leaving character no room in which to grow or form.
    Partly out of diabolical &quot;Gnosticism&quot;, and partly
    no doubt due also to ignorance, some of Leary's group have
    flipped out, and sometimes for months at a time, in sessions
    conducted according to the Leary precepts.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beresford believed sincerely in the vast potential
of psychedelic drugs. 'With safe and intelligent handling (of
LSD),' he wrote, 'the following facts can be substantiated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) There is <i>no</i> possibility of &quot;psychic
    accidents&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Standard psychotherapy can be reduced in
    duration from a matter of years to a matter of months, with
    long-lasting, if not permanent results. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) The degree of &quot;internal
    decision-making&quot; possible is very impressive. A new
    pattern of Gestalt formation, on a level never before thought
    possible outside of classical conversion reactions, is coming
    to light and should be explored. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Knowledge is waiting for the asking
    concerning alterations of the human mind which were thought
    non-existent or merely freakish before new psychedelic drug
    techniques were elaborated. An extensive new area of
    knowledge of mind is waiting to be opened. It is folly to
    ignore this. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 5) It has been beyond all doubt, though perhaps
    beyond credibility, that thirty-five per cent decibel
    increases in hearing are obtained on minute doses of LSD;
    that intellectual procedure beyond the normal capacity are
    commonplace; that new potentials are brought into existence;
    the probability of a high incidence of thought transference
    between two individuals should be brought out into the open.
    Other equally important researches are waiting. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 6) The sensation-minded public press, and the
    providers of scandal, and the prevalent public fear of
    &quot;losing control&quot; through drugs combined to drive
    the most valuable chemical discovery of the century almost
    out of existence. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 7) No more essential publishing service could
    be rendered than to place before the public the unadorned
    scientific, historical and psychological analysis of the
    &quot;extraordinary history of LSD&quot;.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beresford wanted to keep the drug and the research
in proper perspective as tools of the scientifically trained as
specialist. But any tool can only be as good&#151;or as
bad&#151;as the competence of those who use it. Certainly, one
must not assign to LSD intellectual problems which defy our
present intellectual capacities. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jean Houston, on the other hand was interested in <i>advancing
the intellectual capabilities</i> of the modern American&#151;to
meet and solve the problems not of today or tomorrow&#151;but <i>the
day after tomorrow.</i> And by means of a process that you might
call travelling in the <i>'ANTECEDENT FUTURE'</i>&#151;that is
inducing the ego to scan the cognitive parts of the cortex in
order to develop the ability to bring into the present what is
already in the memory and retrieve 'forgotten' information which
is then integrated into the normal intellectual processes of
ordinary consciousness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jean was an intellectually brilliant thinker in her
own right, and, if such things still mean anything, it had been
discovered in a nationwide survey of the I.Q.s of American Ph.Ds,
that Jean's was the highest&#151;a little over the 200 mark', she
once told me, though there was never any question in my mind
about her obvious intellectual gifts, which were always adequate
to meet her function as an Agora director, our third and most
junior member. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As with Beresford and myself, she saw modern
culture strangled by a crisis of value correlative with a
breakdown of its traditional ontological structures. The
'eleventh hour condition' of humanity is that of 'the dark
woods'. We are lost in the woods&#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Alone, alone, about a dreadful wood<br>
    Of conscious evil runs a lost mankind,<br>
    Dreading to find its father lest it find<br>
    The good it has dreaded is not good;<br>
    Alone, alone about a dreadful wood&#133;' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &#151;W. H. Auden </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The poignant theme of the dark wood emerges in the
life of the mind as a symbol of the chaos that must precede the
restoration of Order and the revitalisation of the human
condition. How then is it possible for modern man to extricate
himself from the 'dark woods' of his mind? Jean believed that in
psychedelic drugs we had a means to dispel the clouds of despair,
and spoke of the promise they held 'of Homecoming'; and of the
possibility </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'of guiding man past the dark woods of non-being, past
    deep shadows of aloneness to a world where no longer does man
    view himself as a creature separated and estranged from all
    other creatures but rather as a participant in a rich and
    fertile reality, a reality so interrelated and so full that
    it could only best be described as a dynamic continuum; the
    new reality that unfolds in the &quot;psychedelic
    experience&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The universe is not a collection of separate
    bits and pieces, divided in time and space, but is in reality
    the metaphysical &quot;One&quot;, wherein everything is tied
    up with everything else in a pattern which is absolute for
    the entire universe. The social hierarchy reflects the
    psychological hierarchy, the cosmology hierarchy, and the
    celestial hierarchy; only this reality is not displayed
    within a single action, but instead, in an abundance of
    actions in which the most diverse tonalities follow one
    another in quick succession. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It is thus with the psychedelic experience.
    When the threshold of consciousness is crossed we are flooded
    with the kaleidoscopic vision of cultures, peoples, symbols,
    remnants of historical and pre-historical memory&#151;the
    veritable infinity of humanity which seeks to constitute our
    being. Like Dante in the dark forest we can easily get lost
    in the labyrinth of strange byways and unknown paths. (This
    is an all too frequent episode in the unguided psychedelic
    session.) It should be one of the chief duties of the session
    guide to lead the subject through the newly exposed terrain
    of cultures, histories, eras, and symbols to evoke these
    contents to lead finally to their interrelationship in the
    mind of the subject, much the same way as Virgil led Dante
    through the medieval hierarchical cosmogony so that its many
    parts became inherent in Dante the man. It should be one of
    the chief tasks of the guide to assume the role of Virgil in
    this psychedelically induced Divine Comedy and to indicate
    and select out of the dynamic continuum in which the subject
    is immersed some of the historical incident, cultural
    awareness and racial memory that seems to lie buried in the
    cortex.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jean believed that the reality of the existence of
archetypes had been confirmed and demonstrated in the LSD
session, which seemed to bring mythological and archetypal
structures into conscious awareness. Thus, the role of the
session guide is crucial if the subject is not to lose his way in
the woods. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The guide must steer a course of gradual intensification
    and enhancement of consciousness. The first suggestions must
    be simple and familiar, geared to focus the subject's
    attention on the heightening of colour and form perception of
    well-known objects. Pictures and flowers, music and natural
    objects&#151;these are the data of initial discovery and
    consciousness enhancement in the experiencing subject. It is
    only after several hours of helping the subject build up a
    familiarity with his extended reality that the guide may
    begin to prepare the subject for an exploration of
    transpersonal and phylogenic material.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple, in theory, perhaps, but what in praxis ?
Jean ran many LSD sessions at Agora, which she conducted along
the lines just adumbrated with some quite astonishing results.
She makes some observations on these sessions, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the course of my experimentation I have discovered
    that a most conducive mode of preparation for phylogenetic
    investigation is to be had by taking the subject through a
    &quot;Cook's Tour&quot; of world history. A variety of
    historical situations and occurrences are suggested in a
    sketchy manner. The subject, whose eyes are closed, is asked
    to describe the pictorial display of historic scenery and
    activity which now he &quot;sees&quot;. This he often does
    with a detail and amplification and frequently an accuracy
    which far exceeds his normal historical awareness. Whether or
    not this is owing to the activation of previously learned but
    long forgotten historical information or to a utilisation of
    as yet unknown processes of historical evocation cannot be
    answered at this time. Suffice it to say that the probability
    rests with the former theory and that the subject's
    heightened imagination adds to the vividness with which he
    responds to these suggestions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The subject may be invited to walk along the
    Piraeus with Socrates, to witness a battle in the Thirty
    Years War, to participate in the bull-leaping at Knossos or
    to help in building the pyramid of Khufu. He may be asked to
    gaze over the shoulder of that Cro-Magnon man who painted the
    great bison in the cave at Altamira. He may join in the
    violent thrust westward of the troops of Gengis Khan. He may
    have a front row seat at the battle of Hastings or mingle
    among the courtiers at the court of Louis XIV. History is his
    prerogative and it may be explored as fact or fantasy. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In addition to the historical panorama, the
    guide may invite the subject to participate in a recapturing
    of the evolutionary sequences of life. In many cases the
    subject discards the spectator role which he had assumed for
    the historical tour and finds himself taken up into a seeming
    identification with the stages of the evolutionary process.
    Thus the guide can suggest that the subject <i>become</i>
    that primordial piece of protoplasm floating in an early
    ocean. (This is described as a very restful state.) Then,
    either through the promptings of the guide but more
    frequently through the subject's own initiative there may
    unfold a reliving of the evolutionary process from gill stage
    to man. This re-experience of phylogeny is possible because
    of our germ plasm. Our body contains (however small the bit)
    a part of that physically real primeval mud from which we
    grew, through orders, classes, phyla&#151;to what we are.
    Thus the physical reality of the evolutionary sequence of
    life may become available to our consciousness and we may
    select for it in the psychedelic state. The psychic system
    has an anatomical pre-history of millions of years as does
    the body. And just as the body today represents in each of
    its parts the phylogenetic process, and everywhere still
    shows traces of its earlier stages&#151;so can the same be
    said of the psyche. It is for this reason that the activated
    psyche can be called upon to remember states which to us seem
    to be unconscious. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I would suggest then that ages and attitudes
    of man that are long gone by still survive in the deeper
    unconscious layers of our mind. The spiritual heritage of
    archaic man (the ritual and mythology that once visibly
    guided his conscious life) has vanished to a large extent
    from the surface of the tangible and conscious realm, yet
    survives and remains ever present in the subterranean layers
    of the unconscious. It is part of our being that links us to
    a remote ancestry and constitutes our involuntary kinship
    with archaic man and with ancient civilisations and
    traditions. Depth psychologists have pointed to the
    universality of psychic processes and the continuity of
    psyche within the race. We may add to this the theory that
    the psyche contains all the contents of time&#151;extending
    backwards, across and through time; history being latently
    contained in each individual. It is my contention that the
    psychic depths and the time depths can be tested and explored
    through the medium of the guide in the psychedelic
    experiences. The theoretical foundation of such a statement
    is that the ingestion of psychedelic substances evokes an
    activation of deeply buried psychic contents and a bringing
    of them to the surface of consciousness through the selective
    use of phylogenetic suggestion. As electrodes applied to
    memory or sensory areas of the brain can stimulate vivid and
    realistic recall at the moment of contact, so can suggestion
    activate phylogenetic memory in the subject undergoing the
    psychedelic experience. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In the course of human history man has come to
    the discovery that he is a foreconsciousness that sees only a
    manifold, incoherent world. Gradually he has been able to
    order the incoherence of pre-history by perceiving natural
    laws, by making hypotheses, and by his technological advances
    beginning to apprehend basic common factors and linkages in
    what at first appeared as sheer chaos. Through mythological
    structures he was able to gain some measure of surety in an
    incoherent world. One step further and he was able to
    perceive himself as being largely lawmaker and inventor. And
    now through the agency of the new physics man has attained to
    a knowledge of the mathematical structure of all matter as
    being in reality not inert but an instrument of infinite
    potentialities from which one may draw what forces one will.
    The pursuit of truth is now in fact akin to the creation of
    beauty. Yet all this new extension of potentiality bears with
    it the threat of unparalleleddestruction. I maintain that the
    new physics can be nothing but a deadly danger unless to that
    knowledge is added that of a new history a parallel and
    balanced knowledge of ourselves brought back from the
    subterranean regions of our psyche&#151;our phylogenetic
    awareness.... Then and only then may we use the new knowledge
    of outer nature for life and not for death. Our new vision in
    physics whereby we see ourselves actually devising new
    natural laws and even creating life must be equated with a
    deeper insight of ourselves given by a new knowledge of the
    past. This may be done by restoring man to a dynamic
    communion with his own sundered psyche, with his old sense of
    community, and with the whole of life and the universe.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, Agora was not entirely free from the
crackpot element, in whom the doors of perception seemed, if not
permanently unhinged then certainly wide open. One correspondent
writing from Flamingo Marina, Miami Beach, told of his work with
'a magnetic machine which will hypnotise you and a second machine
which goes inside the brain by rays and removes that part of the
moral degeneracy involved'. And added 'The patient may be
slightly ill for a few days, but his tendencies to sin will be
gone.' I simply replied that we already had one to deal with the
libertine tendencies of our staff, and hoped that his fine work
in ' &quot;prophylactic phrenology&quot; would have wider
application, perhaps as an instrument of the church'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there was a complicated correspondence with an
American Air Force Major from Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, who
wanted Agora to build a 'life-size' Moebius Strip for people to
climb in and walk around 'accompanied by the entire spectrum of
colour and music'. The object of the envisaged 'Strip' is </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'to evoke in the participant any synergic, intuitive or
    emotive process/product of which he may be capable. This is
    for the purpose of unlocking his particular iron curtain by
    working directly on his subconscious through symbols
    (including language), the energy spectrum (light and colour),
    form, and even motion and odours if feasible. The
    super-computer qualities of the mind, including an ageless
    universal memory core, above-time-space programme actions,
    and conscious read-outs makes the mind our greatest resource,
    yet our greatest enigma. It is easy for this mysterious
    &quot;black box&quot; to be fed with <i>sensual</i> inputs
    that turn out a disordered state of consciousness.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In both these examples, it is impossible to ignore
the high moral tone of the two inventors. On the other hand,
which of us would not settle, at whatever cost to our reason, for
a febrile and creative, rather than static way of life ? And the
fact that the light these two ideas throws is a murky one,
doesn't, after all, seem inappropriate to our present situation.
Indeed, you could say that they illuminate the stresses placed on
the modern psyche in its relationship with modern society. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet&#151;I was sensitive to the fact that much
of the stuff going on at The Agora Scientific Trust must sound
every bit as 'crackpot' as the two examples just noted. The
intellectualization of what we had and were doing was a
formidable task. We had to find a way to describe certain changed
or altered states of consciousness, which lie beyond all
rationalization and even beyond all power of words, in a
completely new way which would also be intelligible for other
people, <i>whether they'd taken LSD or not.</i> Thus, no area of
possible fruitful research was ever turned down which could be
organised on the basis of rational belief, and we decided to
structure into an existence an idea or a series of ideas which
were derived from peoples' experience with LSD. During the first
few months of activity our own 'internal' viewpoints were
projected on to the outer world with a content that was found to
be full of meaning for other people. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is an intuitive basis which precedes the
intellectual which provides us with something like a magic armour
with which during LSD sessions nothing ever goes wrong.
Objectively my initial intuitive behaviour during a session when
I have given a person LSD can be codified into a set of precepts
and illuminations which may collectively serve as starting-off
point for others who may want to consider the principles of what
it means to be an 'LSD guide'. The following are some facts and
ideas from our 1963 Agora days I have assembled&#151;they involve
the means by which the 'internal logic' of the LSD situation may
be realised in ordinary consciousness, with what assumptions one
proceeds, with what goals, and what are the determinants of the
goals, and what is the relationship of the knowledge gained
through the LSD experience to daily life and ordinary affairs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had by this time given LSD to some 300 people and
taken it myself about 100 times, and learned by making mistakes,
as was inevitable, that no prior frame of reference can do
anything but hinder. I 'knew' certain things I had no way of
telling before. The intuitive leap had become standardised. For
this reason perhaps it was inevitable that I would sooner or
later leave Agora, terminating one phase and starting another. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what sort of people did we give LSD to ? We had
hundreds of requests from people all over America who wanted to
take it, but the facilities on Eighty-First Street were lacking
for such a large-scale operation. Perhaps I could note four
sessions which can be accurately dated and leave it to the reader
to decide how far they are relevant. (1) An abstract painter, (2)
a Captain in the U.S. Navy Office of Naval Research, (3) a Yogi,
(4) a hedonist sceptic, a wealthy resident of Manhattan's
fashionable Beekman Place and of Gstaad, Switzerland. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (It should be understood that axiomatic to my
belief-fabric is that with LSD each person discovers, or gets,
what they want.) The abstract painter, in the course of the most
extraordinary visual experiences, in concrete and specific
detail, of a mythological residue of a pre-Hindu Indian religious
fantasy, discovered the identity of the image which had been
eluding him from his paintings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Captain achieved extraordinary insight into a
problem of mathematical 'transformations' with which he had been
unsuccessfully grappling for the past five years. His work was in
artificial intelligence via computer design. During the LSD
session, he wrote to us afterwards. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'I suddenly realised that whenever I concentrated on a
    single form and brought it into focus, the situation was
    analogous to setting up a random set of sensor inputs and
    connecting these inputs via a fixed but randomly designed
    network to a series of nodes. I realised that recognition of
    any given pattern is dependent upon calling a halt in the
    normal flow of transformations; and, most importantly for my
    own work, the achievement of really useful automata would
    appear to depend on mechanism that can effectively monitor
    the products of a large number of transformations, select
    from them the important one for study, and the halting of the
    process long enough to classify the signal from the one
    transformation for purposes of pattern recognition.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Translated into ordinary English, the Captain was
trying to invent a 'seeing' machine as effective as the human
eye, for use in atomic submarines.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Yogi, a man who spent seven years before his
arrival in America (where he had become a successful Wall Street
stockbroker) studying yoga in a <i>dhoti</i> on the banks of the
Ganges, jumped from the eighth of the twelve yoga stages&#151;the
name eludes me, but that is as far as he had got&#151;to the
twelfth, called <i>Samadhi,</i> and the very highest form of
Bliss, wherein he achieved the state of total identification with
all of reality that made him&#151;momentarily&#151;God. The man
from Beekman Place for the first time in his life was appraised
of a higher, that is more embracing and inclusive, logic than the
one he had known hitherto. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In each of these four instances&#151;people widely
different in background, education, character, nationality and
physique&#151;it was nonetheless possible to abstract a basic,
simple set of philosophical understandings, which are valid
enough to permit anyone to integrate on a higher-than-usual level
of awareness without any danger of paranoia (the common defence
against chaos, and one which mitigates against anything of value
deriving from the LSD experience) or of anxiety. The talked-about
'hellish experience' is actually completely unnecessary,
avoidable and non-contributory, reflecting inadequate mental
'set' or physical 'setting' or technical knowledge on the part of
the guide or a mixture of all three. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was of course no scientific follow-up on
these four individuals, but it was possible to deduce certain
things when we saw them again a few months later. The painter had
entirely reoriented his method of painting and when I last saw
him, was working fast and productively (and his paintings do
still sell in New York). From the Naval Captain have come some
engineering hardware&#151;'resistor networks to accomplish types
of transformation to be included in patent disclosures being
processed by the Office of Naval Research, Washington under Navy
Case 29093'. The Yogi was found to be, I fear, bewailing the
ordinariness of not being God, but was&#151;and still
is&#151;making money nicely on the Exchange, while the
millionaire believed that he had undergone a complete change in
his beliefs about other people. He has not been heard from since.

&nbsp; &nbsp; It was thus with the establishment of the New York
centre, plus a form of status stabilisation with Washington (via
the U.S. Navy, who intervened on our behalf with the Federal Drug
Agency by placing our work in a rosy, even golden, light which
resulted in a letting-up of investigative pressure on Agora by
the FDA), plus the sketching out of rational (or neo-rational)
methods of managing LSD sessions, that this New York phase ended.
An astonishing, fascinating period, filled with interest, and
with lots of humour at all times to prevent us from becoming
LSD's dupes. But it was only achieved by an enormous amount of
work fed by the energy from our emotional fires. At once the
impatient reminder comes, and it is true: Agora experiment was
achieved at the cost of 'real' emotional contacts with other
people, including, at times, ourselves. The emotional content of
my existence was reduced to a working absolute minimum (though it
was difficult to recognise this process as going on at the time;
only afterwards did one realise at what cost the work had been
achieved). Perhaps it was all an elaborate form of 'self-therapy'
during the tormenting time after the collapse of my marriage in
1960 and plans to reconciliate with my wife and the consequent
loss of my daughter which became formalised at the moment of my
'rearranging of priorities' <i>intellectual, rational/artistic
creative work = No. I; love, emotion pleasure, sanity = No. 2.</i>
I had reached the end of my emotional tether; I had been 'on the
way' before I took LSD, but the paving had given out, and there
were not even stones left to pave new intentions. The country
ahead was dark, impenetrable. I was alone at the mercy of my own
awful fluidity of self; a time indeed of that 'eleventh hour
condition' of which Jean Houston speaks&#151;an impossible hour
of the day which is not marked by the sort of clocks you see in
shops&#151;so I was never sure of the present or certain enough
to determine the content of my emotional future. It is the
temptation to withdraw from emotional involvements, perhaps even
to curl up inside and stay remote from even the slightest
continuity. But of course all things pass&#151;'an afternoon does
not last all day, nor a sunset all night'&#151;and by the end of
the year I began to realise that the pointer of my 'eleventh
hour' was turning and that 'deadened time' was gradually being
displaced by a palpable and love-centred present pushing to the
future. 'The world, like the big wheel in a deserted funfair,
spun slowly toward the final revolution.' (Roger McGough). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All I had really achieved at Agora was the
realisation that the sombre doctors, scientists, technicians
point only to the rigour of their own particular method. Ah ! but
to go without aid in search of truth; perhaps this is the
beginning of wisdom&#151;to proceed with the utmost determination
towards a forbidding future through a series of 'crisis' instants
in which you think you're about to slip over the edge into the
aweful Abyss of Elsewhere, but catch yourself just in time but by
not shrinking from the lightning and thunder, by hurling yourself
forward, unafraid of taking risks, in your struggle towards love,
consciousness, enlightenment, light and God. And thus the Way was
suddenly much smoother; I was over the hump of the year. And it
was in this way, out of such emotional despair, that I stumbled
out of my dark existential forest into the daylight honesty of
Millbrook . . . </p>
