<P>TVX Gold is committed to conducting its activities in a corporately responsible manner.
<P>TVX Gold places major emphasis on workplace health and safety at all of its operations. Safety training programs, designed to improve the safety awareness and performance of all employees both on and off the job, are conducted on an ongoing basis. As an example, the Brasilia mine has been awarded the British Safety Council's Sword of Honour three times, while the International Loss Control Institute has presented its 5-star award to the mine for an unprecedented six years in succession.

<IMG SRC="/images/environment.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=110 BORDER=0 ALT="Environment"><P><B>Environment</B>
<P>TVX Gold is very conscious of its corporate commitment and responsibility to maintain the ecological harmony wherever it conducts its activities. The Company's objective is to have all of its operations, whether they be at the exploration, development or mining stage, conform with or exceed recognized environmental standards for the industry. The Company constantly reassesses its performance in the environmental area.
<P>TVX Gold's operations and projects are located in diverse environmental settings around the world. They are found in the high Andes desert, the Ecuadorian rain forest and in Canada's Precambrian Shield. In contrast to these somewhat remote areas are those operations that are in close proximity to towns, such as Brasilia and New Britannia, or the Kasperske Hory project. A further contrast is the Mineral Hill mine which is adjacent to Yellowstone National Park in the state of Montana.
<P>Each mine develops an environmental program that ensures compliance with locally stated international guidelines while conforming to corporately imposed international environmental practices that ensure the impacts on the local environment are kept to a minimum.

<IMG SRC="/images/CorporateResponsibilities4.jpg" ALT="South American Operations" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT><P><B>South America</B>
<P>The La Coipa mine, for example, is located in a desert environment at an elevation of 4,300 metres in the Andes Mountains where temperatures range from plus 35 degrees to minus 25 degrees Celsius. Water is obtained from wells beneath the Maricunga Salt Lake and transported through a 48-kilometre pipeline to the processing facilities. This method of obtaining process water ensures that the local wildlife and vegetation receive maximum benefit from the minimal natural precipitation that occurs in the area. At most mines, tailings generally have a water content of 50-60%. However, at La Coipa, dewatering is maximized through the implementation of one of the largest filtration systems in the mining industry. This system creates tailings with only 15-20% water, leaving the extracted water available for recycling in the mill circuit. The tailings are transported five kilometres in closed conveyors to the tailings storage facility where they are stacked like beach sand in a stable manner.
<P>The large tonnage, open pit, Brasilia operation is a good example of a mine that co-exists and cooperates with the neighbouring town of Paracatu. Because of its close proximity, Brasilia is concerned with dust, noise control and water quality. Dust levels are monitored at several sites on the property as well as at three locations in Paracatu. Access and internal roads are surfaced with laterite and sprayed constantly with water, while dormant mine areas are sprayed with lime solution to prevent wind-generated dust. All process water is directed to the tailings area and tested daily to check acidity levels, and the presence of cyanides, suspended solids, metals and oxygen. Groundwater monitoring wells downstream from the treatment and collection ponds are tested for the same substances.
<P>As mining proceeds at Brasilia, berms are constructed to screen the mine area, and planted with vegetation. The mine supports its own nursery, which employs four horticulturists, and is capable of providing 20,000 seedlings a year. Over 50,000 trees have been planted on site since the inception of operations. Brasilia's facilities also include an environmental simulation laboratory where chemists are able to assess control methods for potential contaminants.

<IMG SRC="/images/CorporateResponsibilities2.jpg" ALT="Mineral Hill Mine" ALIGN=right WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0><P><B>North America</B>
<P>Mineral Hill is perhaps TVX Gold's most striking example of a mine operated in harmony with its environment. Because of its proximity to Yellowstone National Park, the mine was designed at the outset to strictly protect the environment and has an exemplary record of environmental protection. The local community has been involved since the early days and a citizens' advisory committee continues to meet quarterly to discuss the operation.
<P>The mine has been specifically designed to blend in with its surroundings. Buildings are a neutral tan colour, pipes and electrical cables are buried and new road construction is minimal. Dust on the existing mine roads is controlled by applications of magnesium or calcium chloride, with other materials such as linseed oil also being tested for this purpose. Access to the Crevice Mountain deposit currently under development is by a tunnel originating from the Mineral Hill mine rather than by a surface road. Special fences have been erected to prevent bears and elk from entering the impoundment areas. Garbage is not allowed to accumulate and attract bears, but is transported directly to a solid waste disposal facility 80 kilometres away. Utility poles were redesigned to discourage eagles from roosting and the results were so successful that the local power company is now using similar poles elsewhere in Montana.
<P>Mineral Hill is operated as a zero-discharge facility. Water from the mine and mill is treated to neutralize cyanide and remove heavy metals, and is then recycled to the mill. Ongoing tests have also indicated that concentrations of nitrates in the mine water, resulting from the blasting process, can be reduced significantly by passing the mine water through a series of vessels containing naturally occurring bacteria. Under controlled conditions, biological denitrification has resulted in the reduction of nitrate to elemental nitrogen gas, and it is believed that this work may lead to the development of a low cost, low maintenance treatment for mine water which may be of value at non zero-discharge mines.
<P>Mill tailings at Mineral Hill are dewatered and stacked in thin lifts designed to withstand liquification in the event of an earthquake. The old tailings dumps, left from historic operations on the property, are being transferred to the Mineral Hill impoundment and the excavated areas are being recontoured and revegetated.
<IMG SRC="/images/CorporateResponsibilities5.jpg" ALT="Eagle" ALIGN=right WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=122 BORDER=0><P>One potential concern at Mineral Hill was an old arsenic plant, first operated in 1899, located beside Bear Creek which drains into the Yellowstone River. TVX Gold, through a voluntary reclamation program, removed the building to the tailings area, after documenting it as a historic structure, replaced a metre-thick layer of contaminated soil with new clean topsoil and introduced native grasses. Other historic buildings are being restored and preserved as appropriate, including the mine office, which is located in a building that was used for the same purpose 100 years ago.
<P>When mining is completed at Mineral Hill, the mine area will be restored to its original condition. It is estimated that this will involve re-establishing 80 acres of grassland and 13 acres of Douglas fir forest. 
<P>New Britannia represents TVX Gold's newest gold mine and, as such, employs the most advanced carbon-in-pulp technology to extract gold and the patented Inco SO2 cyanide destruction system to treat the process water. The operation's location within the town of Snow Lake calls for particular attention to be paid to dust and noise control. The location of a mine ventilation outlet on the town golf course demonstrates how residents and the mine can accommodate each other's interests.
<P>Environmental audits of each of the Company's North American properties were completed by the end of 1995.

<P><IMG SRC="/images/community.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 BORDER=0 ALT="Community Involvement"><B>Community Involvement</B>
<P>As one of its corporate responsibilities, TVX Gold supports the communities associated with its operations. This support takes many forms.
<P>At Mineral Hill, local baseball, basketball and bowling leagues have received contributions, as has the district 4-H program which instructs young people in agricultural skills, community service and personal development. Meetings are arranged to inform the community of Mineral Hill activities and the mine provides summer jobs for students from the local high schools and college. Local vendors are given the first opportunity to bid on the provision of supplies and services. The Chief Geologist conducts mine tours and educational programs for school groups.
<P>The Casa Berardi mine supports an industrial chair in borehole geophysics at Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, and a local minor hockey team in the town of La Sarre. Bus transportation is also provided for employees for business purposes from La Sarre and two other locations to and from the mine.
<P>The New Britannia mine has contributed to hockey, curling and golf events, to local service groups and is establishing an annual scholarship for a college or university student. Employees are involved in a wide range of activities from serving on the town council and school board to leading Scout and Guide groups.
<P>Near La Coipa, the San Lorenzo School, strongly supported by the mine, provides education for about 400 pupils, from kindergarten age to 10 years. About 25% of the students are the children of La Coipa employees.
<P>In Rio de Janeiro, TVX Gold funds the Cruzada do Menor, an independent charitable organization which provides underprivileged children with food, improved education facilities and vocational training.
<P>At the Crixas operation, over 100 homes have been built for supervisors and operators in the local town, and a club has been built for employees and their families. A group of buildings was also converted into a school for 50 children and various local projects, such as the repair of a church roof, are supported.
