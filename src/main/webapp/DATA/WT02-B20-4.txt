<CENTER><B>BASIC WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH POLICY MAKERS </B> <BR>
</CENTER><BR>
There are a number of ways to communicate with policy makers--be they legislators who enact policy or agency staff who implement policy.  Regardless of the communication vehicle being used, following are some general principles for good communication to keep in mind.<P>
*     Keep jargon at a minimum.<BR>
*     Be concise and to the point.<BR>
*     Reinforce good decision making.<BR>
*     Communicate before decisions are made.<BR>
*     Continue communication to meet changing needs.<BR>
*     Be dependable and honest.<BR>
*     Use the talents of other good communicators.<BR>
*     Remember you represent others.<BR>
*     Remember what you communicate may be shared.<BR>
*     The message is more important than the medium.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Letter Writing<P>
</B>Officials and their staffs pay careful attention to their mail since it forms the major body of public and voter sentiment on pending legislative activity.  Many persons find it difficult to know how to communicate with their legislator.  Often, form letters with identical wording and petitions are used.  Most legislators, however, place little weight on such an approach.  The type of letter that is most appreciated and helpful is one that is carefully thought out and represents an individual's point of view concerning the bill or legislative matter that is being considered.  It should explain how the measure will benefit the writer or the community, or how the measure can be improved.  This is particularly important in letters from a constituent.  Since everyone does not have the same base of information or experience, letters should have clarity and simplicity, and at the same time reflect respect for the intelligence of the legislator and his staff.  A policy or bill should be specifically referred to by its title and number.<P>
<B>An outline to follow when writing a letter:</B><P>
1.      Introductory paragraph<BR>
         a.     The reason for your letter--including the policy or bill title and number.<BR>
         b.     Describe yourself.<BR>
         c.     What action you are seeking.<BR>
<BR>
2.         The body of the letter<BR>
         a.     Communicate the reason for the action being sought by using:<BR>
          -historical facts<BR>
          -data<BR>
          -credible opinion<BR>
          -impact data<BR>
          -viable alternatives<BR>
          <P>
          -personal experience<BR>
          -weaknesses of opposing points of view<BR>
          -logic     <BR>
     <BR>
          b.     Describe what impact the action will have on the community.<P>
3.          Letter closing<BR>
          a.     Restate action sought.<BR>
          b.     Express appreciation for consideration of views.<BR>
          c.     Indicate willingness to help.<BR>
          d.     State what response you are seeking.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Other points to keep in mind when writing letters:<BR>
</B><BR>
          *     Be careful of grammar, spelling, and punctuation.<BR>
          *     Don't threaten or question integrity.<BR>
          *     Be concise.<BR>
          *     Be legible.<BR>
          *     Avoid jargon.<BR>
          *     Check for clarity.<BR>
          *     A postcard saying, "I hope you will be able to support S.B. 405" is better than no correspondence at all.<BR>
          *     To avoid antagonizing, give reasons for disagreeing and refrain from outright or veiled hints that the position on legislation may cost a vote. <BR>
          *     Officials are accustomed to receiving letters criticizing them for action they take.  However, one of the greatest rewards legislators can receive -- and one that is perhaps most cherished -- is a simple letter thanking them for their performance.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>--------------------------------<BR>
<B>Telephone Procedure</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
1.     Call (202) 224-3121 (Capitol switchboard) and ask for Senator's (NAME) office.<P>
2.     Tell whoever answers the telelphone your name and where you are from.  Ask to speak<BR>
     to the Senator about a matter concerning funding for education of individuals with<BR>
     disabilities.<P>
3.     If the Senator is not available, ask to speak to an aide who handles this matter for the<BR>
     Senator.  Be sure to keep the name of the aide for future calls.<P>
4.     Tell the Senator or aide that Senator (NAME), of (STATE), plans to offer an amendment<BR>
     in the (NAME OF COMMITTEE) (of which Senator (NAME) is a member) to<BR>
     (EXPLAIN WHAT THE AMENDMENT WILL DO).  You support the amendments for<BR>
     (CITE SOME REASONS).  (If you are speaking for others, or represent an organization,<BR>
     be sure to mention that at this point.)  Ask if the Senator will support the amendment.<BR>
     Yes, no, or undecided?  If yes, ask if the Senator will be there to vote?  If no, will he<BR>
     give his proxy to Senator (NAME OF PERSON OFFERING AMENDMENT)?  If the<BR>
     Senator is opposed to the amendment, ask why.  Give your arguments to the contrary,<BR>
     then get others to call.  If the answer is undecided, ask when a decision will be made. <BR>
     Let them know you will call back at that time.  In the meantime, get others to call.<P>

     again.<BR>
<B><BR>
Visiting</B><P>
A personal visit with a member of Congress is an effective way to emphasize your interest in an issue or bill.   A visit with your U.S. Congressman can occur either in Washington, D.C., or at his or her State offices. <P>
<B>Some tips for planning a meeting with an elected official:</B><P>
1.     Make an appointment.  Explain the reason for the meeting, the time needed (usually no<BR>
     more than 30 minutes), and identify any other individuals who will be in attendance.<P>
2.     If others are going, decide who will present the information and how it will be<BR>
     presented.  One possible format is to present the issue, the impact of the issue, and then<BR>
     possible solutions.<P>
3.     Prepare and/or collect any supporting materials to accompany your presentation.  (It is<BR>
     helpful to have materials that you can leave with the legislator.)<P>
4.     Learn the facts regarding your issue, both legislative and any others related to your position.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Practice your presentation.<BR>
<BR>
6.     Learn about the legislator.  Try to find out positions taken on similar issues.<BR>
<BR>
7.     Get to know the staff...they are key people to develop a rapport with.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some tips for conducting a meeting with a policy maker:</B><P>
1.     Be on time.  Don't be disturbed if you have to wait since there may have been<BR>
     unavoidable delays or changes in the schedule.<P>
2.     When you arrive, introduce yourself to the secretary.  If you have a calling or business card, give one to the secretary.<BR>
<BR>
3.     When you meet the legislator (or staff person), introduce yourself and identify the group you are representing.  If you are a constituent, share that as well.<BR>
<BR>
4.     State the reason for your visit concisely and accurately.  Limit the number of issues you discuss and refer to bills by name and number.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Give the legislator essential information, review the critical points, describe the impact of the legislation and share your recommendation.<BR>
<BR>
6.     If your legislator has already publicly supported your position, express your thanks and tell him or her how much his or her efforts are appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
If your legislator has not yet committed to your position, clearly state reasons for<BR>
     supporting your position, and let him or her know you would appreciate his or her<BR>
     support.<P>
If your legislator is not supportive of your position, give him or her the information and politely ask him or her to reconsider the issue.<BR>
<BR>
7.     Be prepared to answer questions.<BR>
<BR>
8.     If possible, leave fact sheets or supporting materials with the legislator. (It may be helpful to include a contact name and number with the materials in case other questions arise.) <BR>
<BR>
9.     Have a picture taken with the official if possible.  Use the picture in local newspapers to<BR>
     provide publicity for the official and your organization.<P>
10.     Thank the legislator for his or her time and leave promptly.<P>
<B>Some suggestions for following up on a meeting with a policy maker:</B><P>
1.     Immediately after the meeting, record what occurred--who you met with, issues<BR>
     discussed, responses received, and any follow-up needed.<P>
2.     Write a thank-you letter to the official.  Summarize points made and include any follow-up information requested.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wiring</B><P>
Western Union provides two special services for persons wishing to register their positions with elected representatives:<P>
1.<U>     Personal Opinion Telegram</U>--allows a person to send a message of 20 words to<BR>
     elected Representatives, Senators, or even the President, for $9.95 (just text).<P>
2.     <U>Mailgram Message</U>--for longer messages, up to 50 words (including sender's and<BR>
     receiver's name and address, salutation, and close) for $17.95.<P>
For more information on these and other services write to The Western Union Telegraph Company, 1 Lake Street, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458, or call your local Western Union office.  Toll-free numbers are listed in local telephone directories.<BR>

<B>Testifying</B><P>
Legislative committees often hold hearings to gather information on a particular issue or piece of legislation.  Being selected to testify before a legislative committee provides you with a valuable opportunity for advocating for improved educational opportunities for individuals with disabilities or for individuals who are gifted.<P>
<B>Some suggestions to keep in mind if you are invited to testify:<BR>
</B><BR>
1.     Do your homework.  Gather as much information as possible about the issue.  Talk to<BR>
     key people in your organization and the field.<P>
2.     Learn what "the opposition" says and prepare responses to their concerns in case a committee member asks questions.<BR>
<BR>
3.     Determine the best person to serve as the witness who presents testimony.  The<BR>
     testimony should be delivered by a knowledgeable, articulate person who is familiar <BR>
     (or has been thoroughly briefed) on the issue(s).<P>
4.     Prepare a draft of the testimony and get feedback from several persons in the field and in the federation or division.<BR>
<BR>
5.     The beginning of the testimony should include: <BR>
       * the name and occupation of the witness.<BR>
       * the name of the group on whose behalf the testimony is being given.<BR>
       * a brief statement on why you support or oppose the bill.<P>
6.     Include in your testimony evidence to support your position, real-life examples of the impact of the legislation, and alternatives for those areas of the legislation that you oppose.  Remember that examples of your own personal or professional experience provide the best supporting evidence when intertwined with other factual information.<B><BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Related Activities for Building Rapport with Policy Makers</B><P>
In addition to the basic forms of communication previously presented, several activities also may be used to build a strong rapport with policy makers.<P>
<B>Some activities to consider:<P>
</B>1.     Invite the policy makers to learn more about the education of individuals with disabilities or those who are gifted.<BR>
<BR>
       *      Arrange for your official to visit special education classrooms or facilities in his or her district or state.
       *      Sponsor a special day to conduct a tour of several special education programs.<BR>
       *      Host a luncheon or dinner for the official to meet key special education leaders and/or professionals.     <BR>
<BR>
2.     Prepare an annual report to legislators explaining the status of services to children with exceptionalities in their districts.  Such reports should include statistics of the number of children served and not served, a description of programs offered, size of the community involved, and additional services needed.  Legislators are always interested in receiving such reports and will often publish them in the records of the legislature.<BR>
<BR>
3.     Invite the legislator to speak or attend an organizational meeting or banquet.<BR>
<BR>
4.     Recognize legislators who have acted in the best interests of children with exceptionalities by presenting legislative statesmanship awards to them or by dedicating educational facilities in their names.<BR>
<BR>
<B>When attempting to involve a policy maker in local activities, consider the following:</B><P>
1.     A legislator's time is at a premium.  Make arrangements through his or her local business office well in advance.  Follow through on a regular basis to confirm attendance.  Leave the schedule flexible enough to accommodate minor changes.<BR>
<BR>
2.     Government officials greatly depend on publicity.  The best payment is to provide<BR>
     extensive press coverage.  Assistance is usually available from their offices.<P>
3.     Cooperate with legislators' staffs well enough in advance so they are prepared for<BR>
     their audience.<P>
4.     Be sure that any information presented to the legislator is accurate.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Legislators will be more interested in participating in local improvement of services to children with exceptionalities if they can identify community interest.  Therefore, involve as many community groups as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Determining the Proper Timing and Amount of Energy to Expend on Communication<P>
</B>For effective political action, it is essential for you to know when to use the techniques of communication, who the appropriate targets of communication are, and how much communication to direct at selected targets to accomplish an objective, yet not exhaust future resources.  <BR>

<B>Keep in mind the following tips:</B><P>
1.     Many bills arouse very little public comment.  Eight to ten letters to a legislator from scattered parts of the state are ordinarily something the legislator will notice.<BR>
<BR>
2.     Usually only a small amount of effort is needed to attract legislators' attention.  But where there is opposition, a stronger effort is needed.  All-out support is essential at critical points on major issues.<BR>
<BR>
3.     Determine which level of effort is needed on an issue:  (1) some response may require a few letters or telegrams to be sent; (2) a strong response may require at least one letter or telegram to be sent from each local chapter; and (3) an all-out effort may require numerous responses to be sent from each local chapter.<BR>
<BR>
4.     Assuming that most members of your network will help sometimes, but very few can always be relied upon, fit the amount of effort to the target.  The more important the target, the greater the effort should be.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Some effort, or even a strong effort, needs to be made from time to time to check the responsiveness of the communication network and to be sure members understand their role.<BR>
<BR>
6.     Chart the progress of bills and be ready to act quickly.<BR>
<BR>
7.     Ask someone in the legislator's office to notify you about times and places for hearings early enough to allow you time to communicate with legislators.<BR>
<BR>
8.     Evaluate your efforts in terms of progress made over a period of time.  Remember that some legislators' proposals are reintroduced and lost repeatedly until enough policy makers are convinced of their constructive value.
