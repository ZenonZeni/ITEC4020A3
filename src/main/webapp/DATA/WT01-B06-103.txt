<P>
Motor vehicle accidents and deaths are part of our daily lives, and 1994 wasn't much better in this respect than the year before. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the highway death toll topped 40,000 in 1994 for the second straight year with a two percent increase in motor-vehicle deaths from 1993 to 1994. The following information provides the facts on driving fatalities:

Research from the National Safety Council concluded that although <b>motor-vehicle deaths</b> occur more often in collisions between motor vehicles than any other type of accident, this type represents only about 45 percent of the total. Collisions between a motor vehicle and a fixed object were the next most common type, with about 29 percent of the deaths.

<b>Passenger cars </b>comprised 74 percent of the registered vehicles and were involved in less than their share of the fatal accidents (59 percent)

<b>Light trucks </b>represent about 20 percent of all motor-vehicle registrations but about 24 percent of vehicles involved in fatal accidents.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
The Federal Highway Administration reports about half of all motor-vehicle <b>deaths</b> occur during the day and half occur at night. Death rates based on mileage, however, are about 4 times higher at night than during the day.

Motor-vehicle deaths in 1994 were at their <b>lowest levels </b>in January and February and increased to their highest level in August.

More fatal accidents occurred on <b>Friday</b> than any other day of the week in 1994, according to reports from state traffic authorities. For all accidents, Saturday had the highest percentage.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Of the estimated 175,128,000 licensed drivers in 1994, about 89,000,000 (51 percent) were males and 86,128,000 (49 percent) were females.
Males have a higher involvement rate in fatal accidents - the rate per one billion miles driven was 25 for males and 17 for females.
<b>Exceeding the posted speed limit</b> or driving at an unsafe speed was the most common error in fatal accidents
