<p>In June of this year, the Labor Department issued figures on 
productivity and wages that were so alarming they should 
have been featured in newspaper headlines and network TV 
newscasts across the country.</p>

<p>Robert Reich, Secretary of the Labor Department which 
chronically under stresses the true state of affairs where 
the working class is concerned, reported to the New York 
Times that there "has been a shift from earned to unearned 
income, from paychecks to dividends and capital gains." The 
Times was worried enough to devote an editorial to the 
subject in which it warned that if this trend continued, 
"the consequences could be explosive."</p>

<p>The Times went on to note that while wages fell by 2.3 
percent (and have been falling for more than two decades) 
and benefits (health, vacations, pensions, etc.) were cut by 
3 percent, "productivity -- output per hour of work -- shot 
up by 2 percent last year and by a gaudy 2.7 annual rate at 
the beginning of this year ... Profits," it continues, "are 
near record levels and stock prices have surged 15 percent 
since January."</p>

<p>A bit uneasy about the implications of its own quoted 
figures, the Times equivocates: "By some measures, these are 
beautiful times." Obviously, not the measure of working men 
and women. For workers these figures translate into less 
food on the table and a sharp decline in living standards. 
With increasing attacks on "safety net" provisions, the 
average worker today stands in the greatest peril since the 
early Depression days.</p>

<p>Practically every day now you can pick up a newspaper at 
random and read something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>The MCI Communications Corporation, while announcing a 21 
percent rise in earnings, said yesterday that it would 
restructure the company, dismissing 2,500 to 3,000 employees 
by the end of the year.... (New York Times, Aug. 3, 1995)
</blockquote>
<p>What's going on? How has it been possible for workers to get 
into a situation where the harder they work, the more they 
produce, the less they get paid? Even worse: the more they 
produce in a shorter and shorter period, the fewer of them 
are needed. And so many find themselves "downsized," 
unemployed, redundant, "too young to die, too old to work." </p>

<p>It's absolute insanity -- even from the point of view of 
corporate America which must realize this process is killing 
the goose that lays the golden egg. Or is there a delusion 
among them that they can go on forever driving workers to 
produce more and more and pay less and less?</p>

<p>Ironically enough, the historic accomplishment of the New 
Deal of over 60 years ago -- which the Republican Yahoos of 
today want to dismantle -- are precisely the cushions which 
have prevented "explosions" of the type the New York Times 
fears and the removal of which will put them back on the 
political agenda.</p>

<p>The drive to disaster seems programmed. Finance capital is 
driven to produce higher and higher profits by the very 
nature of the system, even though that is the one-way ticket 
to suicide. Maximum profits is hailed as the law of the 
land, despite the fact that the mills and factories are 
literally slaughtering workers, currently at the rate of one 
killed roughly every hour and a half. This adds up to over a 
million U.S. workers killed on the job since the 1920s. The 
words of author Edison Bowers in 1930 hold true: "The 
workshop is more dangerous than the battlefield."</p>

<p>Big business has no interest in the worker as a human being, 
but only as a source of profit. Indeed, corporate bosses 
have no interest even in the goods their factories produce -
- of which they know nothing -- only in profit. Production 
is a pretext, not an end. If producing frogs legs made a 
better profit than making steel, the steel mills would be 
close up in an instant to make room for frogs. </p>

<p>Big Banks run the economy and today are identical with the 
government, which has degenerated into nothing more than its 
obedient servant ready to gratify its every wish, including 
openly transforming the armed forces into bill collectors on 
delinquent customer-countries all over the world.</p> 

<p>Although by its nature capitalism always exerts force to 
lower wages to the level of subsistence -- its ideal is the 
worker who is paid just enough to maintain his or her 
ability to work and reproduce -- the course of labor history 
shows that workers can create a counter force even greater 
by means of militant labor action.</p> 

<p>But militant labor action is exactly what was missing from 
the top leadership of labor which presided with remarkable 
complacency over the decline of the labor movement from the 
merger of the CIO and AFL in 1955. Small wonder that only 
some 15 percent of the working class is organized into trade 
unions.</p>

<p>The leadership of the AFL-CIO under George Meany and Lane 
Kirkland was governed by the notion so loudly proclaimed by 
the late David Dubinsky, lifetime president of the 
International Ladies Garment Workers Union, that "unionism 
needs capitalism like a fish needs water."</p>

<p>As a consequence of this kind of class collaborationist 
thinking, labor almost completely forfeited the independent 
political posture of the working class. Workers have few 
voices to speak on their behalf in Congress or state 
legislatures, many of which have passed right-to-work laws 
that did serious damage to the labor movement in those 
states. Labor has no daily press, no face to show the public 
on TV. Hollywood, which has slandered workers almost since 
its birth, only now and then produces a movie that reflects 
the reality of workers' lives. </p>

<p>Labor has been hemmed in and hobbled by a series of laws, 
including Taft-Hartley, Landrum-Griffin, the reversal of the 
Norris-LaGuardia anti-injunction law -- all of it 
culminating in the "hollowing out" of the National Labor 
Relations Board so that only the face remains. </p>

<p>The right and power to call strikes has been severely 
curtailed, not only with devices like the mandatory 60-day 
"cooling off" period (as though strikes were called in the 
heat of passion rather than as the last resort), limiting 
the number of pickets a union can employ and how close they 
can come to the place being picketed, forbidding "secondary" 
picketing and boycotts, and so on. Judges can and 
increasingly do levy huge fines against unions and issue 
injunctions that effectively break strikes. </p>

<p>On occasion Congress, if "stirred up," can and has passed 
laws breaking a strike by forcing the workers to return to 
work. The president too has the power to break a strike, as 
President Reagan (a.k.a. T-10, his code number when he was 
an informer for the FBI and president of the Screen Actors 
Guild as well) proved when he broke the Air Traffic 
Controllers union in 1981.</p> 

<p>The notorious "amendment" to the bankruptcy laws -- the so-
called Chapter 11 -- makes it possible for a company 
unwilling to pay decent wages, or wanting to get out from 
under pension, health and vacation obligations, to declare 
"bankruptcy" and then legally cancel all such contracts and 
obligations, and "reorganize" itself shorn of previous 
commitments. Thousands of workers have lost wages and 
benefits by this device.</p> 

<p>When whole companies arbitrarily shut down, as did the steel 
industry in Western Pennsylvania,, Ohio and Illinois, 
workers suffered enormous losses. Almost overnight their 
homes -- into which they had invested not only their hard-
earned wages but much of their lives -- lost value; some had 
to be abandoned as the owners were forced to look for work 
elsewhere.</p>

<p>What we see in this portrait of the American working class 
is the "market economy" at its very best. Attempts to revive 
it with NAFTAs, GATTs and other opiate dreams are calculated 
to shift the cost of a mammoth redistribution of wealth in 
the world onto the backs not only of Third World workers but 
of American workers as well. They will have their short run 
of hope and illusion and ultimately collapse, leaving the 
situation even worse than when they found it.</p> 

<p>There is only one "cure" for the evils of capitalism and it 
still is socialism -- no doubt a more mature and wiser 
socialism than before, but socialism nevertheless. Life is a 
pitiless master but it rewards those who master its lessons. </p>

<p>History is not over. It has just begun. The class struggle 
has not lessened. It has intensified.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, labor is under direct attack and must defend 
itself. Part and parcel of the attack are the actions of 
Congress, the Supreme Court and the White House annulling 
and reversing certain key advances in the struggle of 
African Americans, Latinos and other minorities. These 
attacks must not be seen in isolation from the simultaneous 
attacks on the rights of labor in general.</p>

<p>Killing affirmative action, cutting projects like Head 
Start, outlawing electoral districts that allow for African 
Americans as well as Latinos to be represented in Congress 
and in state legislatures are aimed against economic 
interests as well as civil rights. Affirmative action is 
tied directly into jobs, Head Start and other projects into 
training for jobs. Political representation is an economic 
question as well. Low wages for any section of labor has the 
effect of lowering the wages of all labor.</p>

<p>Our country cannot survive half-union and half non-union. 
The old union slogan still applies -- an injury to one is an 
injury to all.</p>

<p>Serious as the situation is for the laboring masses, it is 
far from hopeless. On the contrary, the signs are 
multiplying that the long period of setbacks for the working 
class is definitely over. The brazen, arrogant assault on 
the hard-won rights of the workers that has been launched in 
Congress has been a wake-up call to all of labor and all 
progressive forces in the country, ranging from feminists to 
environmentalists, who are under attack. In fact, a natural, 
objective united front of such forces has risen and is 
taking shape. We are at the beginning of a new phase in the 
struggle of democratic America for its birthright -- for its 
native, homegrown, people's America.</p>

<p>There are many impressive straws in the winds of change. 
That Lane Kirkland had to resign while still in office is 
one of them. Before him the AFL had only three presidents in 
over 100 years. None resigned, none were defeated in 
elections, and all lived to a ripe old age. To be forced to 
resign while still in office is tantamount to a preliminary 
tremor that presages an earthquake to come.</p>

<p>Another hefty straw in the wind was the extraordinary 
reception that the AFL-CIO steelworkers local in Warren, 
Ohio extended to Gus Hall last July. Only yesterday, as time 
goes, Communists were driven out of office in the AFL-CIO 
and some locals even refused to accept them as members. To 
turn the town inside out welcoming the biggest Communist of 
them all is something nobody could have predicted only 
months ago!</p>

<p>Another positive note is the unification of three major 
unions -- the United Steelworkers, Auto Workers and the 
International Association of Machinists. In so doing, the 
labor movement takes a big step toward reversing the flaws 
and weaknesses it developed since the Cold War dismantling 
of the CIO. It will also help accelerate other mergers in 
labor -- construction, railroads and teachers come 
immediately to mind.</p>

<p>Added to that is the new, militant note sounded by John 
Sweeney, who heads the "New Voices for American Workers" 
ticket in opposition to the official slate, pledging the 
unions to "recreate a labor movement that will improve the 
lives of working people, not just protect them from current 
assaults." He promises to build "a new progressive political 
movement. We will remind CEOs and the right-wing zealots in 
public office that disrespecting working people is a one-way 
road to hell."</p>

<p>Linda Chavez-Thompson, running for AFL-CIO executive vice-
president on the New Voices ticket said during a recent 
rally in Chicago that the new labor leadership would "change 
the face of labor. It will be my face. It will be your 
face." And Richard Trumka, head of the Miners union who is 
running for secretary-treasurer, told the same rally, "We 
cannot win by running and hiding but only by standing 
together and fighting together."</p>

<p>It's an entirely new ball game. The slate is being wiped 
clean of the do-nothing, class collaborationist past. Old 
illusions, fears and false hopes are being shed. It's a new 
working class we see today -- more militant, more united, 
more class conscious, and more left in it outlook.</p> 

<p>These developments are so basic that Gus Hall recently 
pointed to the beginnings of a new period in U.S. political 
life -- an era in which the working class comes front and 
center into shaping the direction of the class struggle. All 
developments will from now on relate in one way or another 
to this new factor.</p>

<p>Already the ruling class has begun to make adjustments. 
Witness Clinton's recent speech on affirmative action in 
which he said the program has been good for the country. 
Witness his sharpened attacks on the Republican budget. 
Witness most importantly the blunting of the right-wing 
offensive. The ultra-right drive to force the Contract on 
America down the throat of the country is beginning to slow 
down and lose steam in the face of mounting resistance from 
the people.</p>

<p>Workers, Black, white and Brown are angry and are beginning 
to take action. And where the working class goes so goes the 
rest of the country. A working-class explosion is brewing 
below. It's unstoppable. It's inevitable. It will change 
America.</p>
