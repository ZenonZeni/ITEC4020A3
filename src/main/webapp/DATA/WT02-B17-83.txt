<B>Summary of the 1995 Working Groups Meeting: <br>
Bechtel Coporation, San Francisco, CA<br>
October 5-6, 1995</b>


<P>

The Hydrogen Program Working Groups met at the Bechtel Corporation

conference center in San Francisco, California, on October 5-6,

1995.  The meeting was attended by 110 representatives of industry,

academia, and the national laboratories.  It was structured to

provide attendees with programmatic information and an overview

of the individual working groups.  Attendees were asked to participate

in one of four breakout sessions: production, storage, utilization,

and systems integration.  After the breakout sessions, attendees

provided organizers with suggestions on improving the working

groups.

<P>

<b>Programmatic Information</b>

<P>

A Notice of Interest entitled "Research and Economic Development

through Hydrogen Systems Integration" was reviewed.  Its purpose

was to identify research and development projects that would integrate

hydrogen production, storage, transport, and use technologies.

Responses would be used in making a preliminary determination

of the interest of state agencies, universities, commercial 
organizations,

and others in participating in collaborative, cost-shared research

projects.

<P>

Responses, which were received from 31 states, included more than

80 project ideas, ranging from basic and fundamental research

to developmental and technology validation projects.  Collaborations

between industry, academia, state agencies, and national labs

were proposed.  Significant cost-sharing was anticipated in all

project categories.  Project ideas are being evaluated, and the

next steps to take in this process are being determined.  A series

of solicitations will evaluate the technical and economic feasibility

of specific technology validation projects.

<P>

<b>Working Group Overviews</b>

<P>

The four working groups, an integral part of the DOE Hydrogen

Program, were formed in 1995 to provide an open forum in which

researchers and industry could interact to exchange information

on research and analysis related to hydrogen systems.  Each group

is chartered to solicit, assess, and forward recommendations from

industry and other key stakeholders on R&D issues.  Principally,

the working groups facilitate industry's evaluations of R&D

activities and technical input to the program.  The groups also

foster interactions among industry and program researchers.  The

four groups are Production (led by Amy Baker, NREL); Storage (led

by George Thomas, Sandia National Laboratories); Utilization (led

by Jay Keller, Sandia); and Systems Integration (led by Glenn

Rambach, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory).

<P>

At the San Francisco meeting, the group leaders gave a short 
presentation

on each group's objectives.  The Production Working Group will

examine and evaluate process designs and configurations for hydrogen

production technologies; analyze the critical issues that lie

between the science of hydrogen production and the engineering

of process design; and coordinate activities under the International

Energy Agency (IEA) Hydrogen Agreement Annex 10 -- Photoproduction.

<P>

The Storage Working Group will identify and develop plans to address

scientific and engineering constraints to the practical application

of new storage concepts; explore innovative near-term storage

concepts; and coordinate activities under IEA Hydrogen Agreement

Annex 12 -- Metal Hydrides.

<P>

The Utilization Working Group will coordinate R&D activities

on internal combustion engines and fuel cells for mobile and stationary

applications; address safety issues and codes and standards; and

specify technical requirements for broader applications and utilization

of current and near-term technologies, especially hydrogen blends.

<P>

The Systems Integration Working Group will coordinate and evaluate

analyses of technology pathways; develop appropriate parameters

for economic evaluations; address key issues in subsystem integration;

provide evaluation tools for systems validation and demonstrations;

address infrastructure issues; and coordinate activities under

IEA Hydrogen Agreement Annex 11 -- Integrated Systems.

<P>

Following the introductory remarks, the breakout sessions were

convened.  Group leaders provided summary reports of each breakout

session.

<P>

<b>Conclusions and Recommendations</b>

<P>

Following the breakout discussions, the groups reconvened to exchange

insights and recommendations for future working group meetings.

General suggestions, comments, and recommendations are given below,

in no particular order:

<P>

<MENU>

<LI>Each group should have a key person from industry as co-chair<br>

<LI>Working group meetings need to have a clearly stated purpose that

distinguishes them from the multitude of other hydrogen-related

meetings<br>

<LI>Questions were raised about proprietary information and whether

nondisclosure agreements were needed (suggested that this is 
impractical)<br>

<LI>Discussion of details was minimal<br>

<LI>Personal agendas need to be moderated<br>

<LI>Long-term, realistic goals for the program are needed.

</MENU>

<P>

Overall, the meeting was considered to be successful, although

future meetings could be made more productive through advanced

planning and increased industry participation.  The chairs thanked

Bechtel Corp. for the use of its fine facilities, its hospitality,

and its participation.

<P>

The next Working Group Meeting will be held in conjunction with

the Hydrogen Program Annual Review Meeting.  The groups will meet

on April 29-30, 1996, before the Annual Review Meeting (May 1-3,

1996) in Miami, Florida.
