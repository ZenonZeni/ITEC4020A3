        <h3 align="left">Residential Life </h3>
        <p align="left">Children come from all over the country
        to attend St. Joseph Institute. </p>
        <p align="left">St. Joseph's is one of only three schools
        of its type in the United States offering an on-campus
        residency program for its students, making it possible
        for them to receive the quality of auditory/oral
        education that isn't available in their home communities. </p>
        <p align="left">While the decision to board a youngster
        is a difficult one, more than 30 children from 15 states
        and several foreign countries are enrolled at SJI as
        resident students by their parents. The auditory/oral
        education is seen as that important, and that good. The
        residency program can't replace a child's real home, but
        it has earned the confidence of these parents. </p>
        <p align="left">Four dormitory wings spread across the
        10-acre tree-shaded campus in the suburbs of St. Louis.
        Separate units house younger children, older boys, and
        older girls, along with the full- and part-time staff who
        care for them. These living units are connected with the
        rest of the School to improve ease of movement,
        supervision and safety. </p>
        <p align="left">Normally, two children share a room which
        is brightly, comfortably, but not completely furnished.
        The children add the finishing touches and put their own
        &quot;posterized&quot; stamp of identity on their rooms. </p>
        <p align="left">The children have use of TV and rec.
        rooms, a gymnasium, two playgrounds, a soccer field and
        room to run. All meals are prepared and served in a
        dining room that echoes with the sound of children's
        voices at every meal (and snack time). </p>
        <p align="left">Child care staff must have, as
        prerequisites, strong character and sensitivity to the
        children's needs. Upon these personal traits, St.
        Joseph's develops its staff through daily in-service
        training in child care, child development, first aid,
        speech and language development, and supervisory
        procedures. This staff, along with a nurse, provides
        round the clock supervision. </p>
        <p align="left">Resident life at SJI includes study time
        and tutoring, balanced by plenty of organized and
        unstructured leisure time. At all times, the children are
        encouraged by house parents to practice auditory/oral
        skills. This continuity of communication reinforces what
        is learned in the classroom. </p>
        <p align="left">There is other informal teaching which
        the staff imparts. Good grooming, table manners, proper
        public behavior and other qualities children need to be
        taught are addressed in an ordered but loving
        environment. </p>
        <p align="left">The staff uses individual care plans to
        address each child's special needs. These plans are
        written with input from parents and teachers. They note
        the child's strengths, weaknesses, special interests,
        medical or dietary needs, personality, study habits and
        more. </p>
        <p align="left">The residence program is a reflection of
        the Sisters of St. Joseph's call &quot;to serve those who
        would otherwise be unserved.&quot; It also demonstrates
        the national distinction which the Institute long ago
        earned and so consistently maintains. </p>
