<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Frequently Asked Questions</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Where can I turn for answers?</STRONG><BR>
MainStay offers the level of service you've come to expect from a leader in mutual
funds. 
Your
Registered Representative understands your objectives and can help you select the
most
appropriate
Funds for your individual situation.  Whenever you have questions about your
MainStay
investments,
your Registered Representative is one of your most valuable resources.  At MainStay,
we have
dedicated
service representatives who can help explain your investments and the progress
they're
making.  If you
ever need help when your Registered Representative isn't available, we'll be
pleased to
assist.
<P>
<STRONG>Why should I consider investing for growth?</STRONG><BR>
Over time, the cost of just about everything - food, clothing, housing, and health
care - tends
to go up. 
If your investments don't keep pace, you may be falling behind.  Over long periods,
growth
investments
have tended to provide higher returns than fixed-income investments, helping
investors
keep pace with
rising prices.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, many
investors
believe the
higher return potential of growth investing is well worth any additional risk. 
<P>
<STRONG>Should I invest in tax-free funds?</STRONG><BR>
The answer depends on your income and how much of your investment earnings taxes
are
taking
away.  For investors in higher tax brackets, tax-exempt funds offer an excellent
way to keep
more of
what they earn.  Although the returns on tax-free Funds may appear to be lower than
on
other Funds,
looks can be deceiving.  For an investor in the 31% Federal income tax bracket, a
6%
tax-free return
may be better than earning 8.5% in a taxable Fund.
<P>
<STRONG>How often should I shift my investments?</STRONG><BR>
If you select Funds that suit your long-term objectives, you should be able to stay
invested
for the long
term.  An annual portfolio review with your Registered Representative can help you
determine whether
the Funds you've chosen still fit your objectives in the current economic
environment.  If you
decide to
move your money, it's a good idea to do it gradually over time.  Investors who
change Funds
every time
the markets move are as likely to miss opportunities as to capture them.
<P>
<STRONG>Can I use MainStay Funds for my IRA or other qualified retirement
plan?</STRONG><BR>
Yes, except for our tax-free Funds. MainStay Funds can be an ideal choice for your
Individual
Retirement
Account (IRA), Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP), Keogh Account, or other
qualified
retirement
plan.  MainStay also offers 401(k), 403(b), Money Purchase, and Profit Sharing
Plans for
businesses
that want to enhance their retirement benefits.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>  Ask your Registered Representative for details. 
<P>
<STRONG>What is the minimum initial investment in MainStay Funds?</STRONG><BR>
You can invest in most MainStay Funds for as little as $500. The Money Market and
Equity
Index Funds
require an initial investment of $1,000.



<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="1"><B>1</B></A></FONT></SUP> The
Equity Index
Fund is not available for salary deferral plans.  Sponsors should consider the
$1,000
minimum
investment in determining whether the Equity Index Fund is appropriate for other
corporate
plans.</FONT><P>
