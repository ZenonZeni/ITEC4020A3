<P>Pat Meathe, executive vice president &amp; managing director, American Supplier Institute (Allen Park, Michigan), thinks there are at least 10 things that people ought to think about regarding their QS 9000 efforts.

<P><B>1.The Wake-up Call</B>. A great many companies assume they've got quality because they did some things back in the quality-vogue years of the 1980s. They looked at QFD, concurrent engineering, Taguchi, SPC, design for assembly. They did these things and then promptly forgot them. Quality's not like riding a bicycle. And QS 9000 is waking a lot of people up to this.

<P><B>2.The Wake-up Call, II</B>. Think QS 9000 is going to make you revisit your quality methods? Take their pulse? Think about this: That pulse is going to be checked and checked again. Every six months. By an outsider. And if you don't have control of the tools, processes, and strategies to validate your quality, then you're probably going to need a doctor--and we don't mean a metaphoric one--because your business will probably go away.

<P><B>3.It's tools, just tools</B>. If you're intelligent about it, you try to solve problems <I>before</I> they have an effect. So you try to design quality in, but you know you're going to have problems even with this. So you do experiments, which is what Taguchi teaches. And once you get beyond experiments, you look at design for assembly, for manufacturability, for recycling. You look at process tools. But that's what they all are: just tools. Tools don't solve problems. People with the right tools do.

<P><B>4.Traps</B>. Sure, the OEMs are shrinking their supply base. They realize that as they depend on fewer suppliers, they are in a more tenuous position. That is, if something goes wrong, the OEM doesn't have a 
vast supply cadre to fall back on. Which explains 
why they want to make sure that the suppliers that do remain are good. So in order that they not fall into an unexpected booby trap, they want to make sure that their suppliers are sound. Which is why they are so adamant about QS 9000.

<P><B>5.Your Auditor Won't Be Your Pal</B>. Using a consultant to help guide you through ISO certification is fine. If you don't have the resources in-house to do all the detail work, hire an expertone who's expert in what 
<I>you</I> do, not something kind of, sort of <I>like</I> what you do. But don't think for a minute that that same consultant can serve as your auditor. That's not how it works. His hands (and yours) are not clean. A third party auditor (you hire this expert, too) will come in and tell you how good your quality systems are (and, possibly, something about how good your consultant was).

<P><B>6.</B><B>Nervous at the Tiers</B>. QS 9000 is to set a single standard for all first tier automotive suppliers. But what of the second and third tiers? Need they be QS 9000 certified and registered? Need all suppliers be working off the &quot;same sheet of paper&quot;, the 
same thick book of guidelines? Is that even possible? This is a quandary, a gap, a crack in the system. This is making a lot of people nervous.

<P><B>7.Next Wave</B>. Will there be a series of sub-QS standards? Like TE 9000 for tooling? Like 14000 for the environment? Like one for production systems, perhaps based around the Toyota Production System? It's a safe bet. And it, too, is making people nervous.

<P><B>8.Not Charlie's Problem</B>. The quality problem has always been a top management problem. Top management has 
always looked at these things (like quality), and said, &quot;Here, you take care of this, Charlie.&quot; And then they'd move on to something else. QS 9000 has changed all that. QS 9000 is not about a quality manager; it's about the entire organization, from the very top, to the floor, from the product and process, to the suppliers, to customer satisfaction. And top management has to keep its hand in.

<P><B>9.Here Comes Everyone</B>. Global manufacturing means global sourcing. Which pretty much in the past meant 
competing on price alone. Now with the buying criteria being twofold--price <I>and</I> quality--global suppliers are seeing the door begin to crack open a bit. They're saying, &quot;Hey, if I get my quality QS 9000 certified and registered, and GM's in Brazil, and I'm in Brazil, I've got a better chance at getting a bigger piece of the action.&quot; At whose expense? You might want to check a mirror for the answer.

<P><B>10.The Verdict.</B> The bottom line is that QS 9000 has changed--is changing and will continue to do so--everything. And the jury, those who'll decide what it all means to everyone in the community, is still a long way from coming in.
