<H1>Key legal aspects of<BR>
the Climate Change Convention</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is part of the 
body of legal rules that govern relationships among states and international 
organisations</B>.  International law determines the obligations and rights that members 
of the community of states have towards each other.  It does not normally apply directly 
to individuals or to private companies. Treaties (often called conventions) are one of the 
most important sources of international law.  They are formal agreements between two or 
more states to do or to not do certain things, or to do them in a certain way.<P>
<B>The Convention is legally binding only on those states that have agreed to be 
bound by it</B>.  A state that is bound by a convention is called a party.  To meet its 
obligations under a convention, a party may need to impose legal obligations on its 
nationals.  For example, the Climate Change Convention obliges developed country parties 
to take measures aimed at limiting their greenhouse gas emissions.  To meet this 
commitment, these states may need to adopt national legislation that will in turn encourage 
or require companies and individuals to limit <I>their</I> emissions.<P>
<B>The Convention was concluded through a formal procedure.</B>  The task of 
drafting a treaty involving numerous states and a complicated issue is often assigned to a 
body of government representatives set up by a UN agency or other international 
organisation.  The Climate Change Convention was negotiated and drafted by the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (INC/FCCC), a body established by the UN General Assembly (fact sheet 209). 
Participation in the INC/FCCC was open to all member states of the UN and its 
specialised agencies, and efforts were made to involve as many states as possible. 
Meetings were organised and serviced by a Geneva-based secretariat.  The INC/FCCC 
took just 15 months to draft the Convention, a remarkably short time given the complexity 
of the issue and the diversity of positions represented.<P>
<B>The INC/FCCC negotiated and then formally adopted the Convention.</B>  At 
the end of a treaty negotiation, ministers and other duly empowered representatives of the 
negotiating states formally express their collective consent to the draft text.  The treaty is 
then considered to be adopted, although not yet legally binding.  The Climate Change 
Convention was adopted by the INC/FCCC, the same body that drafted it.<P>
<B>The Convention was officially opened for signature at the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED). </B> Signature is generally the first step 
towards accepting a treaty.  During the Conference, also known as the Rio Earth Summit, 
the Convention was signed by 154 heads of state or other senior national representatives, 
as well as by one regional economic organisation (the European Economic Community, 
now the European Union).  It remained open for signature until 19 June 1993, by which 
time 165 states plus the EEC had signed.<P>
<B>After signing, states must ratify the Convention in order to become parties</B>.  
Ratifying can take time because many states must have treaties formally approved by 
parliament or some other legal body.  They may also need to adjust their national laws to 
reflect their new treaty obligations. States that ratify a treaty accept it as binding and are 
obliged to implement it.  The Climate Change Convention entered into force<I> 
(</I>became legally binding on its parties) on 21 March 1994, 90 days after the 50th 
ratification.  Those states that were not involved in the drafting and adoption of the treaty, 
or that join after the closing date for signature, may still become a party to the Convention 
through a procedure called accession.<P>
<B>International law does not provide a single, clearly defined way to make states 
respect the treaties to which they are parties.</B>  Some experts argue that 
international law provides rules on liability and responsibility which require states or 
individuals that have caused environmental damage to restore the affected parts of the 
environment, pay compensation to those that suffered damage, or both.  However, these 
rules are of limited value for problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, where the link 
between cause and effect can be difficult to prove.<P>
<B>The Convention creates its own institutions for monitoring compliance</B>.  
Parties to the Convention must regularly provide information on their performance to the 
Conference of the Parties (COP).  These documents are made available to all other parties 
and discussed by the COP.  Two subsidiary bodies are created by the Convention to 
provide expert advice for assessing the reports and the effectiveness of the measures that 
parties take.  In this way, all parties will know if a state is not meeting its commitments.  
This can provide an incentive for a state to comply with its obligations so as to avoid a 
negative international reputation.  Many other treaties also use this so-called "institutional 
supervision" method to monitor compliance.  It is becoming an increasingly important 
mechanism for issues where a country's failure to meet its commitments affects not  just 
one other state, but the entire international community.<P>
<B>Any party can raise questions about whether another party has complied with 
its commitments under the Convention.</B>  If possible this should be done through 
negotiation or other peaceful means.  A multilateral "non-compliance procedure" could be 
adopted to allow the issue to be addressed in a non-confrontational setting aimed at 
facilitating compliance with the Convention. Alternatively, the parties may use more 
traditional methods of dispute settlement, including conciliation, arbitration, and 
adjudication.  The parties concerned could agree to bring the dispute before the 
International Court of Justice or to another agreed forum.  Legally, the resulting decision 
would have to be respected.  The decision of the court or arbitrator may oblige a state to 
honour its commitments in the future, restore the damaged parts of the environment, or 
pay compensation.  One possible drawback of this approach is that all states involved in 
the dispute must have previously accepted the jurisdiction of the arbitrator or court.<P>
