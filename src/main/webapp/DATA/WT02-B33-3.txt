HILL'S CHOICES ON VETO: A QUICK FIX OR POSSIBLY NO BILL

   Congress can quickly resolve President Clinton's veto of the $264.7
billion fiscal 1996 defense authorization conference by softening the
offending provisions or it could dig in its heels, lessening the likelihood
that there will be a defense authorization for FY '96.
   Clinton vetoed the bill largely because of its provisions for "a costly
missile defense system able to defend 50 states from a long-range missile
threat that our intelligence community does not foresee in the coming
decade." The bill called for developing a national missile defense (NMD)
system for deployment in 2003.
   The president also complained about provisions requiring the discharge
of all service members who test positive for HIV, the virus causing AIDS,
and restricting his authority to put U.S. troops under United Nations
command.
   Senate Armed Services ranking Democrat Sen. Sam Nunn (Ga.) warned of the
veto threat over NMD all year and at one point during the conference,
congressional sources said, chastised Republicans for being more interested
in a campaign issue than in getting a bill.
   Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), chairman of the House National Security
Committee's research and development subcommittee and the leading House
negotiator on missile defense, said the Republicans conceded every NMD
issue to the White House except the call for deployment by a date certain.
Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the procurement subcommittee,
said the Republicans wanted to do away with "the research-forever
syndrome."
   "I remain committed to enacting a defense authorization bill for this
fiscal year and will immediately begin work with my colleagues toward this
end," House NSC Chairman Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), said in a statement
issued after the veto last Thursday.
   Spence could not be reached for comment Friday. It was not immediately
clear whether he and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-
S.C.) would seek to reconvene the conference shortly after the start of the
new session tomorrow or wait until the week beginning Jan. 22 when the
House was scheduled to return for the President's State of the Union
message.
   Starting later raises the possibility that various interests may
separately conclude they are better off with no bill at all. For example,
some proponents of additional B-2 stealth bomber production might prefer no
bill to possible restrictive language against further B-2 production.

PHILIPPINE AIRLINES IN $3 BILLION DEAL FOR 32 AIRBUS, BOEING JETLINERS

   Philippine Airlines is close to finalizing a $3 billion aircraft order
from Airbus Industrie and Boeing, although only Airbus has confirmed the
details of its share.
   An executive with the airline was quoted in Paris press reports early
last week as saying that they were nearly finished working out details of a
buy of eight Boeing 747-400s and 24 Airbus aircraft - a mix of long-range
transports, big twins and medium-haul aircraft.
   Boeing officials were unavailable to confirm their portion of the
order.
   Under the deal, PAL will get four four-engined A340 long-range
widebodies, eight A330 widebody twins - the direct competitor to Boeing's
777 - and a dozen A320s.

RUSSIA, CHINA LAUNCH U.S., INDIAN SATELLITES

   RUSSIA AND CHINA orbited U.S. and Indian satellites Thursday in separate
launches from their respective national launch centers. A Chinese Long
March 2E lifted the U.S. Echostar-1 direct broadcast platform from Xichang,
while a Russian Molniya-M boosted India's IRS-1C from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan with a 550-pound Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization spacecraft dubbed "Skipper" riding piggyback. Skipper was
designed to study reentry vehicle performance for the U.S. missile defense
effort, with instruments developed by Utah State University mounted on a
bus built by Moscow Aviation Institute and NPO Lavotchkin. U.S.-based EOSAT
will distribute the Indian remote sensing data commercially.

CHIEFS' PROCUREMENT PUSH A CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY FOR FY '97

   Although reworking the fiscal 1996 defense authorization conference
report to satisfy President Clinton's veto will be the first order of
business for the two congressional military committees, both panels start
the year in strong agreement that for FY '97 the focus will be on funneling
more money into procurement without raising the top line in defense
spending.
   Priority for the House National Security and Senate Armed Services
Committees will be rewriting that portion of the FY '96 authorization that
provoked the veto, primarily the ballistic missile defense section. But
once that is out of the way, the FY '97 budget will be next on the agenda.
   The White House is expected to send its defense budget to Capitol Hill
early in February. There is a surprising degree of consensus in Congress,
and in the Pentagon as well, that lawmakers should adhere as closely as
possible to the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that procurement be
boosted 50% to $60 billion in FY '98, two years ahead of the Clinton
Administration's schedule.
   The Joint Chiefs made the recommendation in a budget assessment
submitted in November by their chairman, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, to
Defense Secretary William J. Perry. Their concern is two-fold: that
existing modernization projects have been delayed by a lack of funds, and
that projected savings elsewhere in the budget may not be realized to free
up monies for increased procurement
   The Administration requested $38.7 billion for procurement in FY '96, a
figure Congress boosted $5.4 billion to $44.1 billion in the defense
appropriations act. Rep. C. W. (Bill) Young (R-Fla.), chairman of the House
Appropriations national security subcommittee, said in an interview that
even while Congress "won't be able to increase the top line," he will try
to increase procurement funds within those numbers.
   The congressional budget resolution set the national security FY '97
ceiling at $267.3 billion in budget authority and $265 billion in outlays,
a rise of $2.6 billion in authority and $1.7 billion in spending. Young
said he plans to call the service chiefs to testify on their request for
speeding up the procurement increase.
   "For them to make this kind of a request and do it publicly is very
unusual," he said, predicting the Chiefs' testimony will swing a lot of
weight on Capitol Hill. "That says to me that they're really serious about
this."
   The Senate panel made its intentions clear in its fiscal 1996 report 
when it said DOD "decisions to cancel or delay modernization programs
create unrealistic modernization funding requirements for the future."
   The Armed Services Committee noted its $5.3 billion procurement boost
and $1.7 billion increase in research and development, and said it believes
that DOD "must continue to fund these accounts at similar, inflation-
adjusted levels in future budget requests."
   House National Security Chairman Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.) said he also
intends to focus on the Joint Chiefs' request to accelerate the
modernization increase. Like Young, Spence said the projected procurement
increase would have to be achieved without raising the top line.
   Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), chairman of the House NSC research and
development subcommittee, said his panel will hold hearings on theater
missile defenses, exploring command and control and the problem of
differentiating between strategic missiles, which are restricted by
treaties, and theater types, which are not.
   Weldon said he is assembling a team of outside experts to tackle the
intelligence community "head on" over their assessments of the Russian
military.
   "My impression right now," he said, "is that the intelligence community
is sanitizing reports to Congress because it wants to support the Russian
leadership."

FOR PENTAGON IN '96, BOSNIA AND THE BUDGET WILL BE KEY

   The Defense Dept. will spend much of 1996 dealing with Bosnia operation
and its $2 billion pricetag. As troops try to keep warring factions apart,
planners back at the Pentagon will be trying to reprogram funds to pay for
the effort.
   Congressional approval for a reprogramming will be required, and
Congress will certainly have a say in the source of the offsets. Defense
Secretary William J. Perry says he wants to take the money from unrequested
funds that Congress provided for fiscal year 1996, including long-lead
money for more B-2 bombers, but he may have trouble doing it.
   Another issue that will pit the Pentagon against Congress is the DOD
plan to reduce the number of theater missile defense programs in its fiscal
1997 budget, which is slated to go to the Hill early this year. The move
comes as Congress is pushing hard for missile defense.
   Congress hasn't been entirely supportive of one TMD program, Corps SAM
(or MEADS) - Senate authorizers proposed zeroing it. But it does enjoy
support at the Pentagon, and, because of its international dimension, isn't
about to be cut.
   This election year isn't likely to see many defense programs on the
chopping block, or even many controversial program decisions, for that
matter. Some of the high stakes decisions were made last year, when the
Pentagon decided to buy only 20 B-2s and to go for more C-17 airlifters
rather than a Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft.
   Still, some key decisions are slated for 1996. Among the most closely
watched will be the downselect in the Joint Advanced Strike Technology
(JAST) program's concept demonstration phase. But even though one of the
competitors - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and a team headed by McDonnell
Douglas - will be knocked out, many expect the loser to keep an alternative
alive in case JAST hits a snag.
   Munitions programs will also be in the spotlight. The Pentagon will
award two pre-engineering and manufacturing development contracts for the
Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) program late in the year,
kicking off the effort in earnest. The final downselect in the AIM-9X
Sidewinder competition will also be made a year's end, leaving a candidate
from Hughes, or Raytheon, or a derivative of the British ASRAAM, to be
developed as the new U.S. Air Force/Navy short-range air-to-air missile.
   Pentagon observers will also be watching to see what happens to the
Joint Requirement Oversight Council. Headed by Adm. William Owens, the vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the JROC has had major input in the
merging of service requirements. But industry and DOD officials aren't
certain what Owens' impending retirement will bring, and whether his
replacement, Air Force Gen. John Ralston, will have the same fervor for
program consolidation.
   Also, while the Pentagon in 1996 will probably stick with its strategy
of fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts, a
change to a more modest goal is expected to come in 1997. Such a shift
would almost certainly prompt changes in the force, as well as the
restructuring of programs.

PLUS CA CHANGE: STEADY CONSOLIDATION IN STORE FOR AEROSPACE

   If you're an aerospace CEO with cash burning a hole in your balance
sheet, 1996 may be your best year for a merger or acquisition, but that
doesn't mean the slow, steady consolidation of the 1990s will give way to a
mad rush to close deals this year, financial analysts and industry
executives agree.
   "1996 probably won't be all that different from 1995," says Merrill
Lynch VP Byron Callan, who predicts "one or two surprises" on the scale of
Raytheon's acquisition of E-Systems last spring, "one big multi-industry
divestment," such as Westinghouse's break-up, and "a whole bunch of smaller
deals," along the lines of Litton's buying PRC for $425 million, or Thiokol
buying Howmet.
   What's different this year? "The big thing is just the valuations,"
Callan says, echoing other Wall Streeters who think the $2.3 billion
benchmark Raytheon set for defense electronics acquisitions "is going to
stick."
   Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, defense and aerospace
companies spent most of their energy downsizing, and selling off pieces for
cash - "monetizing," as restructuring leader General Dynamics described it
- but so far very little of that cash has been spent. Coupled with a
modestly improving defense and aerospace outlook, that leaves a lot of
eager buyers and few sellers.
   "ITT is basically frozen out of doing anything" because of the terms of
their existing restructuring plans; "TRW has pretty much said flat out they
don't see the need to do anything rash," and "most of the managements of
big publicly traded companies have said they want to remain independent,
with Northrop Grumman being the prime example of that," Callan says.
   He recently told clients that the scarcity of sellers and the high
prices that will be paid to close deals will have "mixed implications" for
defense and aerospace companies and their shares, "benefiting those stocks
viewed as takeover candidates, while possibly harming those that rely on
growth via acquisition," such as Loral and Tracor.
   While those factors will temper the enthusiasm for mergers and
acquisitions, there are also plenty of reasons to get deals done soon.
Interest rates are low, and 1996 will be the last relatively quiet period
before election-year uncertainty takes hold.
   "From a seller's standpoint, can sellers sit back and wonder if they're
going to get as good a deal in 1997 or 1998," Callan says. "There are a lot
of hypotheticals out there."
   There will be a new Administration; there may be a Republican in the
White House, and there may even be another Bottom-Up Review of defense
plans and programs after the new team takes over. The longer sellers wait,
Callan argues, the more likely it is that buyers' enthusiasm will wane.
   Even so, the lull will be temporary, and some analysts looking just a
little further into the decade think there may be a whole raft of new
defense properties coming on the market. The 1990s saw several big
combinations - Martin Marietta buying GE Aerospace, followed by the new
company's merger with Lockheed; Northrop buying Grumman, and then buying
Vought; Loral buying IBM Federal Systems - and some of those combinations
may begin to unwind in a few years.
   "Bigger has proven better for shareholders, but we wonder just how much
of a competitive advantage it has imparted to those who have embraced
consolidation," Callan says. "If there are two or three more big deals in
1996, we think that an issue for investors to start pondering is whether
the new defense empires might be better able to unlock value by instead
breaking themselves up."

ARPA PUSHING MULTI-CHIP MODULES, MEMS, LOW-POWER DEVICES

   Defense electronics will both push and be pulled by the commercial
market in the coming year, drawing on dual-use technologies capable of
satisfying military requirements for customized, compact, rugged, portable
information subsystems, either embedded in military weapon systems or
capable of providing tailored information services to military personnel.
   Lance Glasser, director of ARPA's Electronics Technology Office, says
cheaper, smaller and faster electronics will create markets beyond today's
applications and enable information technology to be applied to new
domains. Despite the pull of commercial technologies, DOD-unique
technologies, as well as technologies in which DOD needs to lead the state
of the commercial art, will continue to exist.
   The emerging technology of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is
creating families of microscopic sensors and actuators capable of
interfacing directly with microprocessor-based advanced information
processing systems for both military and commercial applications.
Commercial applications are leading the way. Goodyear, for example, is
developing passive sensors that would be embedded in truck tires to monitor
pressure, temperature and tire wear and to provide a unique identification
code for each tire as an anti-theft measure.
   "Coupled with advances in wireless communication, low-power electronics
and conformal/embedded manufacturing, this miniaturization will not only
lead to improvements in the operation and maintenance of
equipment/processes and increased sensing capability over wide areas, but
also to applications in broad areas ranging from personal inertial
navigation systems to microsatellites," says Kaigham J. Gabriel, MEMS
program manager at ARPA.
   Success to date with its Multi-Chip Module (MCM) development program to
integrate digital and analog components in the same package has led ARPA to
push for an end-to-end capability in Application Specific Electronic
Modules (ASEMs) in a variety of military applications.
   Principal goals for ARPA's ASEM program this year call for creating a
full service merchant capability, including design, manufacture and test;
cutting the non-recurring engineering (NRE) time five- to 10-fold from 1992
levels and NRE costs at least five-fold to less than $25,000. Clock speed
is to be pushed up five-fold to 500 MHz.
   ASEMS are the successor to Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICS), and among the trends that ARPA sees driving the new markets for
ASEMs are increased portability of electronic products, greater concern for
the form factor as the products are reduced in size, increased use of
battery-powered wireless products, merging of computing and communications,
greater demands for reliability and anticipated reductions in the cost per
function of around 50% every 18 months.
   In anticipation of expanding demands for low power devices for a wide
spectrum of military applications in mobile, wireless electronic products,
ARPA last year launched a program to create an industry-wide technology
base.
   The goal of the program, designated Low Power Electronics, is to enable
the electronic portions of future systems to dissipate two orders of
magnitude less power than is possible today with conventional technology-
while at the same time maintaining at least parity with current systems in
such performance metrics as clock frequency, bandwidth and noise margins.
   According to Zachary J. Lemnios, low power program manager at ARPA,
applications of the near-term future build on such existing commercial
products as hand-held GPS navigation devices, the constantly shrinking
personal computer, mobile communications devices with global reach and
health monitors and other biomedical devices.

1996 SHAPING UP AS A BIG YEAR IN SPACE, WITH PITFALLS

   Events planned over the next 12 months promise to shape international
spaceflight for decades to come, but just what that shape will be depends
on the outcome of missions and commercial ventures set for launch in 1996,
and on decisions to be made in the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in the
polling places of the Russian Federation.
   By the end of the year the first of the "Big Leo" communications
satellites should be in low-Earth orbit; Europe's Ariane V should be an
operational launch vehicle, and the configurations of the next-generation
U.S. launchers should be a lot clearer.
   However, the future of the International Space Station remains murky.
NASA managers - with the White House watching carefully over their
shoulders - must find a way to keep Russia in the program now that they
have rejected a cost-saving proposal to plug Mir into the configuration
(DAILY, Dec. 26). And the economic reforms at the heart of Russia's space
partnership with the rest of the world will be put to the test in June,
when Russian voters pick a president as Boris Yeltsin's term expires.
   In January, 10 years after the Space Shuttle Challenger was lost, the
Shuttle built to replace it is scheduled to lift off on a mission devoted
in part to testing tools and techniques for Station assembly (DAILY, Dec.
21). As Endeavour orbits overhead, Shuttle managers on the ground will have
started work in earnest to transfer Shuttle operations to United Space
Alliance, a joint venture created to take on the job, by September (DAILY,
Nov. 8, Dec. 1).
   The Shuttle prime contract is but one effort to trim fat from NASA's
budget so it can mount a "balanced" program while building the Station. In
February, NASA's Office of Space Science will launch the first of its
"faster-better-cheaper" Discovery platforms, the $150-million Near Earth
Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), toward an encounter with 433 Eros in January
1999.
   But in the end it will be the Congress that decides whether the Station
is built. With the U.S. government in budget gridlock as the new year
begins, the $2.1 billion-a-year Station pricetag seems particularly
vulnerable. And the squeeze on NASA spending will become even tighter as
the agency decides which of three competing designs it will build as its X-
33 reusable launch vehicle (RLV) prototype.
   In April the subscale McDonnell Douglas DC-XA will return to the skies
over White Sands, N.M., for a series of vertical takeoff and landing
flights designed to test materials for the X-33 (DAILY, Dec. 16, 1994). By
then the troubled X-34 program should be back on track (Dec. 11, 14),
giving the U.S. two shots at developing the world's first commercial RLV.
   Big spending in government civil space programs like the Station and
Shuttle notwithstanding, the end of the Cold War continues to open
opportunities for commercial space operations. Last year the U.S. launched
more commercial than government expendable launch vehicles, and the trend
will continue in 1996 (DAILY, Dec. 22). Abroad, Ariane V is scheduled to
fly for the first time, and a Russian Proton will launch its first Western
satellite.
   The launch glut is good news for satellite-makers, who have a lot of
hardware to orbit. In September a Delta II is scheduled to launch the first
batch of Iridium communications satellites to LEO, with another flight
scheduled in November, while competitor Globalstar should be putting the
finishing touches on its platforms for a first launch in mid-1997.
   In the U.S. alone, the Aerospace Industries Association expects
commercial programs to pace a $1 billion rise in space-sector sales, to $28
billion for the new year. Profits of a different kind should come in early
in the year, as NASA scientists locked out by the government shutdown
finally get to report the first results from the Galileo spacecraft's probe
of Jupiter's atmosphere. Spectacular images of the Jovian system will
follow in the months to come.

FEELING FLUSH

Largely absent from last year's customer list, U.S. carriers can be
expected to start dusting off long-postponed plans to buy new aircraft and
engines. Jetliner market-watchers waiting for hopeful signs got a good one
Friday - new figures showing that U.S. airlines finally made money in 1995,
after four years of red ink. Air Transport Association chief Carol Hallet
says a sound economy, higher fares, fewer fare wars and cheap gas combined
to produce 1995's $2 billion industry-wide profit, adding that 1996 looks
"hopeful."

BUSY, BUSY

   The balanced-budget battle and accompanying layoff of some federal
workers may make for a relatively busy month of January on Capitol Hill,
contrary to congressional leaders' intentions. House GOP leaders had
planned a three-week vacation after the mandatory start of the second
session of Congress tomorrow, with lawmakers returning the last week in
January for the State of the Union message. Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) had planned no roll call votes in the Senate in January. But
if President Clinton and the Republican congressional leadership produce a
budget settlement, lawmakers would have to be called back to approve
related appropriations bills and implementing provisions.

SLOW START

   Senate consideration of the START II Treaty has been put in limbo by
President Clinton's veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization
conference report. Senators took up the treaty on Dec. 22, but GOP leaders
held up a final vote in hopes of putting pressure on Clinton to sign the
defense authorization bill. With the veto, pressure to speed ratification
has eased.

RUSSIAN TALKS

   Russian space officials are pleased at NASA's response to their plea for
help saving money on the International Space Station, even though their
plan to build the new Station around the old Mir was rejected (DAILY, Dec.
26). Engineers at the Russian Space Agency and its top domestic contractors
are studying the NASA counterproposal presented in Houston last month, and
looking forward to another session with U.S. Station officials, probably in
Moscow next week or the week after. Under orders from the Russian
government to cut costs, the engineers had feared a "put-up-or-shut-up"
response from NASA, which would be politically unacceptable to nationalists
and numbers crunchers in the Duma.

NASA'S PLAN

   To help Russia save money and launch vehicles, NASA is willing to ferry
Russian crews to and from the Station once it is inhabited, and to defer
construction and delivery of the Science Power Platform (SPP) and the three
Russian laboratory modules it was to have served. But the complex and
expensive Russian Service Module is still set to be the third Station
element launched under NASA's plan, and that could cause heartburn in
Moscow. So could NASA proposals to assume more flight control
responsibility at Mission Control Center-Houston during assembly, and to
reduce the amount of Russian crew time aboard the Station until the
laboratory modules are delivered.

POWER PROFILE

   Deferring delivery of the SPP, which would use six Russian launches
early in the assembly sequence, will require a substitute for the attitude
control gyrodynes the first SPP segment is to carry. But it won't hamper
power delivery to the U.S. laboratory module originally set for delivery on
the flight following the first SPP delivery. That's because NASA decided
early on that the SPP couldn't give the U.S. lab all the juice it needed,
and shuffled the assembly sequence to place a U.S. solar array on the
Station before the lab goes up (DAILY, July 15, 1994).

JAPANESE SPENDING

   Japan's parliament is expected to sign off on government spending levels
for the fiscal year beginning in April, which includes $47.5 billion for
defense, an increase of 2.58% of the current fiscal year. Under the budget
plan finalized last week, funding for procurement will be $8.19 billion, or
1.2% more than this year.

END IN SIGHT?

   The Joint Primary Attack Trainer System protest saga is slated to come
to a close at the end of this month, when the General Accounting Office
rules on Cessna's protest. Last month the GAO turned down Rockwell's
protest. Raytheon won the hotly contest JPATS program in June (DAILY, June
23), but progress on the program ground to a halt when the protests were
filed.

SECOND SUPER HORNET FLIES

   Two McDonnell Douglas F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are set to enter flight
testing at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Md. early this year. The company and
the Navy last week completed another important milestone on its Super
Hornet program when the second prototype, designated E-2, successfully
completed its first flight. Both E-1 and E-2 will fly in the test program.

TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE

   To cash in on the potential savings from DOD's Single Process Initiative
(SPI) this year, contractors will have to act quickly. DOD wants to post
the actual savings by the close of the fourth quarter of FY '96, and that
means contractor-proposed savings in overhead costs must be approved by
already overburdened administrative contracting officers (ACOs) almost
immediately if the changes are to be implemented by mid-year. The SPI seeks
to reduce reliance on military specifications and apply commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) procurement across the defense industry (DAILY, Dec.
8, 11).
