<H1> Suzuki RE-5 1975-77 </H1>

<P> The RE-5 was powered by a 498 cc single rotor water cooled engine.
It was first shown in 1973 at the Tokyo show.  The first model year was
1975 and it was produced for three model years.  The instrument panel
and tail light were contained in cylindrical shapes to play on the
rotary theme.

<P> The engine was tested for 100 days non-stop on a dynamometer at the
Hamamatsu factory.  It was also ridden in snow in Alaska and desert
heat in Death Valley.
