<p>
In 1995, four working groups were formed under the DOE Hydrogen 
Program to provide an open forum for researchers and industry members 
wanting 
to exchange information on their progress in research and analysis.  Each 
group 
focuses on one of these four areas:  hydrogen production, storage, 
utilization, or 
systems integration.  The groups solicit recommendations from industry 
and other 
key stakeholders (interested parties) on important research and 
development 
(R&D) issues.  The working groups enable industry to provide input to the 

program and create mechanisms for technical evaluations of R&D 
activities.
<P>
The working groups are more than just a means for keeping researchers and 

industry members informed about the work of their colleagues, however.  
They also 
address technology issues beyond the program to identify new areas that 
should be 
included.  Descriptions of each group follow:
<P>
The Production Working Group examines and evaluates process designs 
and configurations for hydrogen production technologies; analyzes 
critical issues 
that lie between the science of hydrogen production and the engineering 
of process 
design; and coordinates activities under the International Energy Agency 
(IEA) 
Hydrogen Agreement Annex 10--Photoproduction.
<P>
The Storage Working Group develops plans to address the scientific and 
engineering constraints on the practical application of new storage 
concepts; 
explores innovative near-term storage concepts; and coordinates 
activities under 
IEA Hydrogen Agreement Annex 12--Metal Hydrides.
<P>
The Utilization Working Group coordinates R&D activities on internal 
combustion engines and fuel cells for mobile and stationary applications; 
addresses 
safety and codes and standards issues; and specifies technical 
requirements for 
broader applications and utilization of current and near-term 
technologies, 
especially the use of hydrogen blends.
<P>
The Systems Integration Working Group coordinates and evaluates analyses 

of technology pathways; develops appropriate parameters for economic 
evaluations; addresses key issues in subsystem integration; provides 
evaluation 
tools for systems validation and demonstrations; addresses infrastructure 
issues; 
and coordinates activities under IEA Hydrogen Agreement Annex 
11--Integrated 
Systems.
