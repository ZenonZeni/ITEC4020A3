 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING SKIN </H2>

 <P>  Premature aging of the skin due to excessive exposure to sunlight is an increasing problem across the world today.   It is characterized by thinning of the skin, wrinkles, yellowing, mottling and leathery dryness. It can easily lead to skin cancers of all types.  Photodamaged skin actually undergoes structural changes, along with the simultaneous loss of collagen and elastin. This loss causes less resilience in the skin making it appear aged.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MARINE CONCENTRATE</H2>
<P>  The unique marine concentrated extracts contained in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are obtained from certain cold water fish.  These have been shown to provide special nutrients that support both collagen and elastin production in the body and Lit the same time help protect them from destructive ultraviolet light and enzymes. This specific concentrated extract is made up of over 50% polysaccharide and 30% protein.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OTHER NUTRIENTS</H2>
<P>  Other synergistic nutrients are included in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS to help support healthy, vibrant skin including Vitamins A, D, E and C, Silica from herbal sources, Norwegian Kelp, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, rice protein and zinc.  These nutrients synergistically support healthy, youthful skin.</P>
<P>  All the ingredients in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are as completely natural as possible.   The active ingredients are either in their totally natural occurring state or have been concentrated for maximum results.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> YOUTHFUL RADIANCE</H2>
<P>   Your skin is the largest organ of your body and is the first thing someone sees when they look at you. As the aging process continues, the most visual changes occur here.  Our outward appearance influences how we feel about ourselves and how others see us.   By taking FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS, you can ensure that your skin receives many important nutrients valuable in revitalizing and preserving that youthful glow.</P>
<P> Younger skin cells are more vibrant and look more youthful than older ones. When they are supplied with the proper nutrients, they are able to retain moisture and contain more collagen, which results in healthy, thicker skin that is more elastic.</P>
<P>  FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS help your skin regain and retain its youthful radiance from within. It provides essential nutrients that feed the lower skin levels where new skin cells develop.  The combination of these fantastic tablets with the FOREVER YOUNG topical skin care products is the best way to have that youthful skin you have always wanted.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS</H2> 
<P>It is recommended to take one tablet twice a day, usually first thing in the morning and at bedtime. This is the minimum amount to take, and at the same time usually produces great results.  However, if you have damaged skin, or would like to get maximum results as soon as possible, more tablets should be taken. If you intend to be in the sun, it is a good idea to take several tablets for additional protection.  For maximum results, use FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS with the four great FOREVER YOUNG topical skin care products, <A HREF="mfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>,<A HREF="mfyfp.htm"> FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>, <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX </A> and <A HREF="mfybp.htm">BODY PERFECTING LOTION</A>. However, the tablets can be taken alone if desired.  Other Life  Plus  products that are especially synergistic with FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> and <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A>.</P>
