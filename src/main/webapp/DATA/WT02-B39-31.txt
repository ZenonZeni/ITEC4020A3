NEW ISSUES - WORLD COLOR LONG TERM BUY

   Currently an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, this company is a leading diversified commercial printer providing
digital prepress, press, multimedia, binding and distribution services to
customers in the magazine (an estimated 33% of 1995 net sales), catalog
(21%), direct mail (9%), commercial (30%), directory (7%), and new media
market sectors. Since the appointment of a new management team in May 1991,
the company has taken streamlining and other special pretax charges
totaling $196 million (including $38 million in the fourth quarter of
1995), invested more than $200 million in equipment and plant expansions to
position itself for growth and productivity improvements, and made nine
acquisitions having an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million.
   The company maintains 14 printing plants, one warehouse, one
prepress/warehouse facility, five prepress facilities, one
distribution/bindery facility, two distribution centers, and one multimedia
facility. The company supplies all of the ink and a substantial amount of
the paper it uses. An extensive network of sales offices located throughout
the U.S. is staffed by approximately 250 sales and marketing
representatives.
   Assuming exercise of the overallotment option, KKR is selling
approximately 12 million of the shares being offered, affiliates of Merrill
Lynch are selling about 2 million shares, and numerous less than one
percent holders are selling their shares. KKR's stake will be reduced to
50.1% (approximately 49% assuming exercise of the overallotment option).
Certain minority shareholders have agreed not to sell any of their
remaining shares for 120 days after the close of the offering, and the
company, KKR, and remaining stockholders have agreed not to do so for 180
days. As of October 1, 1995, debt was 59% of total capital. In 1995,
lenders increased the maximum available under the company's credit
facilities, of which about $89 million remains available.
   Since 1991, the actions of the new management have resulted in a
significant improvement in profitability. Measured by adjusted operating
income margin which excludes steamlining and other special charges,
profitability has increased from 3.4% of revenues in 1991 to 7.1% in the
first nine months of 1995. This has occurred despite that revenue growth
over that time has largely been derived from acquisitions and increases in
paper prices, offset to some extent by higher paper costs.
   Because of the company's substantial leverage, we think free cash flow
is a good method of valuation. Importantly, cash flow has been adequate to
pay down a substantial amount of acquired debt. The company projects
capital expenditures in 1996 will total $75 million and scheduled debt
principal payments total $21 million, leaving free cash flow by our
estimate of about $20.5 million, or $0.60 a share. We also expect free cash
flow will increase an average 40% annually over the next several years as
debt is repaid. Discounting projected free cash flow at the riskfree rate,
the stock price could increase 100% to 125% over a five year period. In the
short term we see the stock climbing to 22 to 24. We recommend purchase of
the shares as a long term holding.

NEW ISSUES - OMNIPOINT SHORT TERM BUY

   As a result of this company's work in developing core spread spectrum
technology (software and integrated circuits) and working prototypes based
on this technology for various wireless voice, data and digitized
compressed video transmission projects, the FCC awarded it a Pioneer's
Preference right to a 30 MHZ license to provide Personal Communications
Services (PCS) for the New York Major Trading Area (MTA). The New York MTA,
with 26.8 million people, has the highest population of any MTA in the
nation. The FCC determined the company's license fee at 85% of the average
per population price of the winning bids for the top 23 MTAs, times the New
York MTA's population. The company has been accruing interest on this
obligation at the prime rate and expects interest only payments to begin in
1996. The company is also participating in the Entrepreneurs' Band Auction
for small businesses for additional PCS licenses in each of the 493 Basic
Trading Areas.
   The Omnipoint System has been designated by a key industry standard
setting group as IS-661. IS-661 is one of four technical common air
interfaces (CAI) competing for adoption by PCS license holders, the others
being PCS-1900, a system similar to the digital wireless standard common
across Europe and adopted in many other countries, CDMA, and TDMA, both of
which are being upbanded to the 1900 MHz section of the radio spectrum from
current cellular technologies.
   Each CAI has its proponents among equipment manufacturers and service
providers. The Omnipoint System, as the company proposes to implement
IS-661, is a hybrid system that will interface with PCS-1900 based systems.
It also incorporates certain coding features of CDMA between cell sites,
but uses timing features of TDMA within cells to separate channels. The
company expects that initial capital costs to deploy a commercial IS-661
system, incremental capital costs per subscriber, and ability to rapidly
scale up a system as demand grows, will enable it to offer a variety of
wireless services at lower costs than current cellular and wireline
competitors.
   The company has entered into or committed to agreements with Northern
Telecom for Omnipoint to buy, and for Telecom to sell infrastructure
equipment and finance system buildout, up to $612 million. It has also
entered into a series of agreements with Ericsson for, among other things,
the development of dual mode IS-661/PCS-1900 handsets. The agreements
obligate the company to purchase $250 million of infrastructure equipment
and $100 million of handsets from Ericsson, which will provide up to $375
million of vendor financing. Additional handset development, manufacturing,
marketing and sale agreements have been entered into with JRC International
and Hansol Paper Co., the latter being primarily in Korea and other parts
of Asia.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used for interest payments on the New
York MTA license, for development and marketing of Omnipoint technology and
equipment, and in connection with additional PCS licenses, if any,
purchased by the company. Other than the New York MTA license obligation,
other debt as of September 30, 1995 totaled $26 million.
   The three largest shareholders are Avance Capital, which will own 22% of
the outstanding shares, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, L.P. 16%, and
Allen & Co. 9.7%. Insiders and their affiliates in the aggregate will
control 64% of the stock. About 1.2 million shares will be eligible for
sale in the public market beginning 90 days after the offering closes, and
26.4 million upon expiration of the underwriter's 180 day lockup period.
   Although IS-661 has obtained separate CAI designation, IS-661 systems
are designed to be compatible with PCS-1900 systems. PacBell and Bell
South, which will construct PCS-1900 systems in certain license areas, have
tentatively agreed to provide each others' subscribers with roaming
capability in the others' license areas. The company expects to have a
pilot system in operation in New York City in the first half of 1996, and
to begin wider deployment by the end of the year.
   Significant revenues will not occur until 1997, even if all goes
according to plan, which it will likely not, judging by the experience of
other wireless service firms. We believe losses will be sustained through
1999. Nevertheless, based on per POP valuations of wireless services firms,
we think the stock price will initially rise from the 13 to 15 range
proposed for the offering, but is likely to be volatile as quarterly
results exceed or fall short of expectations. We recommend purchase of the
shares as a short term holding.

NEW ISSUES - VANSTAR SHORT TERM BUY

   This company provides extensive PC network infrastructure products and
services throughout the network life cycle which it divides into four, more
or less distinct stages: design and consulting, deployment, operation and
support, and enhancement and migration. The company exited the retail arena
in early 1994, which was conducted primarily through the Computerland
franchise business.
   The current business strategy is predicated on the belief that the
market for outsourced PC network services is growing at a compound annual
rate of more than 14%, and that profitability can grow at a faster rate
because the valued added services which comprise a growing percentage of
the company's business have higher margins than the traditional services
which it provided, such as product procurement and repair and maintenance.
   The company's technical workforce currently exceeds 2,200 employees
nationwide, including a rapidly expanding systems engineering force, which
grew from about 200 in March 1994 to over 600 as of October 1995. The
company will seek to expand its business globally by entering strategic
alliances with international partners. Over the past four quarters, about
225 customers purchased products and services totaling at least $1 million.
The domestic sales network as of October 31, 1995 consisted of over 540
field sales and service representatives. A variety of service automation
software products have been implemented to reduce the cost and enhance the
delivery of the services to the customer. Products from over 700 vendors
are provided.
   Proceeds from the sale of eight million shares for the company will be
used to repay debt. The company maintains a $425 million credit facility
with IBM Credit Corp. at prime plus 1.06%. As of July 31, 1995, long term
debt would have been 70% of committed capital on a pro forma basis,
however, this is somewhat misleading since a large portion of the credit
facility is used to finance inventory. Nynex Worldwide Services Group is
the selling stockholder. Nynex obtained the shares when it sold the assets
of its Nynex Business Centers business to the company in fiscal 1991.
Warburg Pincus Capital will own 35% of the stock after the offering.
Although our copy of the prospectus was incomplete in regard to future
sales of stock, we assume that most of the currently outstanding shares are
subject to a 180 day underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume
limitations.
   The pressure to cut costs and eliminate non-core operations is likely to
keep the outsourcing trend intact over the next few years. We project
earnings growth at over 14% annually, but it is likely to be uneven. Given
that 1995 PC sales were so strong, growth in 1996 is apt to be particularly
weak by comparison. We view the shares as fairly valued if offered at 11
1/2, but recommend purchase in anticipation of buy recommendations from the
underwriters, after which we would sell the shares.

NEW ISSUES - IRON MOUNTAIN AVOID

   Approximately four trillion documents are generated each year in the
U.S., and paper remains, at least for now, the primary medium. About 80% of
the documents generated each year are not needed for frequent reference,
and can be considered inactive records, for which it provides storage
services in 66 facilities in 25 markets across the U.S. containing an
aggregate of 4.9 million square feet of space.
   As of September 30, 1995, Iron Mountain stored approximately 21 million
1.2 cubic foot cartons for 14,000 customers. New customers are obtained by
a dedicated sales force. An ongoing fee is collected for storage, and
nonrecurring fees are charged for storage materials and services, such as
document retrieval. The company also provides vital records services for
items such as master audio and video recordings, and provides courier
services via a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles. We believe that growth
in the number of documents generated and outsourcing of document storage
activities has resulted in an increase in the number of cartons stored
which has outpaced the 4% attrition rate experienced by the company due to
destruction or permanent removal. Internal growth has been augmented by
additions of new customers and acquisitions of other document storage
businesses.
   Proceeds from the shares sold on the company's behalf will be used to
redeem a warrant, fund several pending acquisitions and repay debt incurred
for other recently completed acquisitions. Long term debt on a pro forma
basis as of September 30, 1995 was 64% of total capital. About $17 million
was subsequently borrowed to fund recently completed acquisitions. CEO
Richard Reese will own 16% of the stock outstanding after the offering, and
Vincent J. Ryan will control 36%, including 20% held by Schooner Capital
Corp. The sellers are Schooner, Chase Manhattan Investment Holdings, and
Security Pacific Capital Investors, L.P. A small number of shares become
eligible for sale in the public market beginning 90 days after the
offering, but most of the currently outstanding shares are subject to a 180
day (360 day in the case of Ryan and Schooner) underwriter's lockup
agreement.
   Although there will be about $47 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under the company's credit agreement, we believe that
further leverage would necessitate the curtailment of planned capital
expenditures. It already appears that current obligations have been
extended to maintain debt levels at their current level. If additional debt
is assumed for more acquisitions, as is the company's plan, we think that
it will have difficulty meeting interest and scheduled principal repayments
after 1998. Scheduled payments this year of about $2 million, and of $3.3
million and $3.4 million in 1997 and 1998 should not be a problem, but the
$8.3 million payment in 1999 becomes difficult if the balance sheet is
leveraged further.
   How did the company get into its current financial position? We think
it overpaid for the businesses it has acquired, paying about 2.1X revenues,
which is the same ratio of our 1996 revenue projection to the proposed
market capitalization of equity plus debt. We would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - HEARTSTREAM AVOID

   More than 350,000 people in the U.S. suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)
each year. SCA is characterized by rapid and irregular heart beat, or
ventricular fibrillation, in which the heart's normal electrical signals
become disorganized and erratic, causing the heart to cease pumping blood
within a few minutes. Defibrillation involving the application of an
electric shock to the heart, causing it to resume a regular rhythm, is
necessary to prevent death from SCA. It has been documented that timely
defibrillation can boost the survival rate from SCA to over 70%. Often
paramedics or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) equipped and trained in
the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) do not arrive on site
quickly enough, resulting in average SCA survival rates in the U.S. of 5%.
AEDs use computer technology to interpret the patient's heartbeat to
determine if defibrillation is necessary. This contrasts with hospital
based defibrillation units with which most people are familiar, that
require medical personnel to interpret an electrocardiogram.
   This company has developed and clinically tested an AED which it
believes is easier to use and maintain, requires less training, and costs
less than current AEDs in use. The American Heart Association (AHA) has
endorsed the training and use of AEDs by ``first responders'', i.e. police
and fire personnel in addition the paramedics and EMTs, and The Department
of Transportation has adopted guidelines which include AED training for
EMTs beginning in 1995. The goal is that police and fire personnel, who
typically are on the scene prior to medical personnel, can administer AED
in a timely manner. Also, EMTs, who usually receive substantially less
training than paramedics, are typically not trained in the use of AEDs due
to the expense of training and purchasing AEDs for EMT ambulances.
   The company has conducted two clinical trials which show no difference
in efficacy between its AED, called the ForeRunner, and AEDs currently on
the market. The trials actually measured the efficacy of a method of
delivering the electric shock that uses lower energy relative to the
standard higher energy AEDs currently in use. A 510(k) application to the
FDA was submitted in December 1995 for clearance to market the ForeRunner
on the basis that it is substantially equivalent to AEDs that have been on
the market since before 1976.
   Proceeds from the offering and cash on hand, which together on a pro
forma basis totaled $49 million as of September 30, 1995, will be used to
fund product introduction, to build a sales and marketing organization, for
continuing research and development, and for working capital and general
corporate purposes. Long term obligations are nominal. Four venture fund
groups will own 5% or more of the stock to be outstanding after the
offering, including entities affiliated with Mayfield Fund 23%, Oak
Investment Partners 7%, Weiss, Peck & Greer 6%, and Medical Innovation Fund
II, L.P. 5%. Insiders in the aggregate will own 37%. Future sales of nearly
all of the shares currently outstanding are subject to a 180 day
underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume limitations.
   Despite the submission of a 510(k) application to the FDA, we must
classify this offering as speculative. The FDA may require additional
clinical data or may rule that the ForeRunner does not qualify for pre-1976
device equivalency. The ForeRunner has never been tested in the field. The
low energy electrical stimulation which it uses does not meet current AHA
guidelines, and certain states have additional laws regarding which AEDs
may be used. The company and five of its founding employees are subject to
a lawsuit brought by their former employer alleging misappropriation of
trade secrets and tortious interference with business relations. Even if
all these issues are resolved, we believe it will take at least three or
four years for the company to become profitable. We would avoid the
shares.

NEW ISSUES - PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AVOID

   In 1994, worldwide expenditures on research and development by
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are estimated to have been $30
billion, of which this contract research organization (CRO) believes $1.5
billion was outsourced to CROs. Among the services which the company
provides are Phase I clinical testing, laboratory analysis, Phase II-IV
clinical trial management, clinical data management and biostatistical
analysis, treatment investigational new drug applications, medical writing
and regulatory compliance, and health care economics and outcomes
research.
   In the nine months ended September 30, 1995, the pharmaceutical industry
accounted for 74% of net revenues, biotechnology 16%, the National
Institutes of Health 8%, and other 2%. Therapeutic areas from which
revenues were derived were virology/AIDS/infectious diseases 30%,
gastroenterology/metabolic diseases 27%, critical care 11%,
pulmonary/allergy 11%, central nervous system 10%, and other 12%. At
September 30, 1995, there were 165 active contracts with about 110 clients
in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and the backlog was $50.2 million, versus
$21.6 million a year earlier.
   Contracts are based on specific project proposals developed by the
company's business development personnel in response to potential clients'
requests. We believe the contract cycle can be quite lengthy. Contracts are
usually on a fixed price basis, so the company bears the risk of cost
overruns. Senior management has experience with the regulatory process in
previous positions with Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. At September 30,
1995, 86 employees had post-graduate degrees.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt incurred to make a
final S corporation distribution to current stockholders. Total debt
outstanding will equal 14% of total capitalization. The company will seek
to renegotiate the terms and the amount of its credit facility. Insiders
will own 77% of the shares outstanding after the offering. Most of the
currently outstanding shares become eligible for public sale under Rule 144
after a 180 day lockup period.
   We estimate revenues per employee in 1995 will be about $78,000, which
seems low. It is likely that the company has been adding significant
numbers of business development, research and other personnel, which have
not been reflected yet in revenue growth. This is supported by the
substantial increase in backlog and in the rise in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 20.4% in 1993 to
33.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 1995. The revenue per employee
may be misleading. Even so, we find it difficult to believe that
compensation levels at the company are adequate to motivate professional
research personnel. A recently adopted stock option plan should aid
employee retention. The company has likely benefited in its hiring from
downsizing of R&D staffs at major pharmaceutical firms that have been
acquired.
   Still, we think that a business in which the overwhelming key to success
is the performance of its employees in conducting research under fixed
price contracts, in which many variables can lead to unpredictable results
and cost overruns, and which is not capital intensive, is better suited to
be a privately held entity. Minority shareholders are apt to find their
interests do not always come first. Moreover, at 30X our $0.50 EPS for 1996
on revenues of $55 million (with 24% more shares outstanding), which
represent 43% and 47% gains over projected EPS of $0.35 (pro forma for
income tax provision) and revenues of $37.5 million, we believe the shares
are amply valued. We would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - NICE SYSTEMS AVOID

   Everyone is aware of the increased use of automated voice systems to
handle everyday business communications. Examples include voice mail and
automated call routing. Increasingly, computer telephony integration
applications are being developed for more important transactions such as
brokerage orders and mail order pharmaceuticals, for example. Voice records
have long been kept for critical communications such as emergency response
centers and air traffic control facilities. Organizations' growing need to
record, process, and store large amounts of voice data has resulted in the
introduction of digitally based voice logging systems that can handle large
volumes of calls at lower costs.
   This Israeli based company's principal product, NiceLog, can record,
store and retrieve up to thousands of analog and digital telephone lines
and radio channels, and enables simultaneous access by multiple users.
NiceLog incorporates enhanced digital networking and voice processing
technologies in the areas of computer telephony integration, digital signal
processing, mass storage and database management. It uses an open
architecture that provides connectivity options to networks such as Novell,
IPX, and TCP/IP using DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and UNIX operating systems
(a Windows 95 version is expected to be introduced in 1996), and
telecommunications interfaces such as T1, E1, ISDN, and analog trunks.
   An add-on module, Call Logging System, enables prompt location and
retrieval of data records according to several key record details, such as
time of call, duration, extension number, and calling number. The company
has sold hundreds of NiceLog units (each capable of handling 96 channels),
to more than 150 users worldwide. A fax logger and a logging system for
customers with requirements in the eight to 24 channel range are under
development. The company also develops and sells communications
intelligence systems, primarily the NiceFix, which enables users to detect,
locate, and monitor transmissions, or ``get a fix'' on the transmitting
object, and provides engineering services for other defense applications.
   The company primarily sells its products to distributors specializing in
the voice logging market. For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, 86%
of total sales were to customers outside of Israel and 52% were to
customers in the U.S. The company has arrangements with IPC Information
Systems and Etrali, two trading room switching equipment suppliers, to
market its products, and with Northern Telecom and Aspect
Telecommunications to market the compatibility features of NiceLog with
their automated call distribution systems. Contracts have been won to
supply up to 800 U.S. air traffic control centers with NiceLog systems over
seven years and for the air traffic logging system at the new Hong Kong
airport. These two contracts have a combined value of $3.4 million to $13
million, for a period of one to seven years.
   Proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. The ordinary shares trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and on
12/27/95 closed at 10 13/16. In October 1995, the company sold its 57%
stake in NiceCom, a developer of advanced data communications switches, to
3Com for $53 million, and subsequently paid dividends of $2.10 per share.
No long term debt is outstanding. Insiders as a group will own 19% of the
shares outstanding after the offering.
   The U.S. air traffic system contract award is a major win because it
gives credibility to the company in the U.S. Still, the company has
generally not been profitable, and despite the contract award, we do not
think the company's products have a clear technological advantage over
competing systems. Most costs are recorded in New Israeli Shekels, while
most sales are made in, and the reporting currency is, dollars. Israeli
inflation in recent years has exceeded the rate of devaluation of the
shekel against the dollar, thereby lowering dollar earnings. This and the
dividends paid after the sale of NiceCom made the shares more attractive to
Israeli investors, who may have pushed up the stock price, despite the lack
of dollar profits.
   It is not assured that a liquid market will develop for the ADSs. The
recent dollar equivalent share price in Tel Aviv is about 23X our $0.45 EPS
estimate for 1996. We do not believe this adequately discounts the risks of
buying the stock, and we would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - PHYMATRIX SHORT TERM BUY

   Formerly known as Continuum Care Corp., this physician practice
management company provides or has entered into agreements to provide
management services to 112 physicians, including 56 oncologists, and
provides related medical services. It also owns a 44% interest in a newly
formed management services organization for a physician association based
in Connecticut of over 240 multi-specialty physicians and has a 50%
interest in a medical facility development company. The business is the
conglomeration of several physician management firms operated under common
control by CEO Abraham D. Gosman, who is also CEO of Meditrust and founded
The Mediplex Group, which was acquired by Sun Healthcare Group in June
1994.
   Several factors are combining to put the solo physician or small
partnership practice at a disadvantage to management organizations. For
example, the information systems that are necessary to respond to the
requirements of managed care organizations and the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are costly and usually beyond the means of most practices. By
joining a physician management organization, physicians can cut costs and
reduce the volatility of their earnings. In other words, the changing
payment structure of the U.S. healthcare system has made the practice
management model a better deal for most physicians. Healthcare reforms
being proposed should only bring more pressure to bear on physicians to
join management groups.
   Up to $32 million of offering proceeds will be used to repay
indebtedness to Mr. Gosman and about $50 million will be used to repay
obligations guaranteed by, or to substitute for collateral provided by
Gosman. On a pro forma basis, long term debt would be 18% of total capital.
The company is negotiating to obtain an acquisition/working capital line of
credit. Gosman will own 40% of the stock outstanding after the offering.
All of the shares to be issued to him and other management and founding
stockholders are subject to the holding requirement of the Securities Act,
and may not be sold in the open market until the second anniversary of the
closing date of the offering.
   The company intends to pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy, so
future results may vary substantially from our estimates. Industry
fundamentals favor physician management organizations, and because only a
small percentage of the approximate 650,000 physicians in the nation have
joined a management group, we think there are ample acquisition candidates.
As the company brings more physicians within its structure, it will realize
economies of scale and cost efficiencies will result in much improved
margins.
   We are projecting a pro forma loss for 1995 of $0.20 a share on revenues
of $128 million, including a $2.5 million charge in the fourth quarter to
write down certain acquired assets at their book value. In 1996, our
forecast is $160 million in revenues and EPS of $0.25. Tentatively in 1997,
revenues could top $200 million, and EPS could more than double. We
recommend purchase of the shares as a short term holding, with a price
target of 21.

NEW ISSUES - WILMAR SHORT TERM BUY

   Outsourcing is one of the important trends in American history. This
company markets and distributes repair and maintenance products principally
to the apartment housing market, and in 1995 initiated sales to the
hospitality, health care, and institutional markets.
   The primary marketing tool is the Wilmar Master Catalog, containing over
14,000 skus of standard and specialty plumbing products, 36% of sales in
the first nine months of 1995, electrical 19%, hardware 16%, chemical and
janitorial 6%, appliance parts 5%, window and floor coverings 5%, HVAC 5%,
paint and accessories 4%, and other products 4%. The catalog is
complemented by a local direct sales force in 34 markets and a telesales
force in other markets which maintain frequent contact with the company's
19,500 active customers. These efforts are augmented by national and
regional accounts serviced by senior management and by participation in
Buyers Access, a group purchasing organization of apartment property
management firms. Members of Buyers Access accounted for 23% of sales in
the nine months ended September 30, 1995.
   The company operates 10 distribution centers and offers next day
delivery for orders over $25, either by its own trucks or a contract
service. The company has found that customers order significantly more in
areas in which it offers next day delivery. Standard or customized billing
services can be provided, and electronic order access is available. The
company has developed foreign sourcing of a broad array of private label
products, which accounted for 18% of net sales in the first nine months of
1995.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay all company debt and
redeem all outstanding preferred stock. In March 1995, CEO William Green,
the sole stockholder at the time, sold a substantial interest in the
company to Summit Investors. Additional funding was borrowed to complete
the November 1995 acquisition of One Source, operator of a supply
distribution business in Miami, for $3.7 million. As a result of the
recapitalization, Green and Summit Investors have withdrawn $28 million in
capital from the company.
   Green will convert $5 million of preferred stock into common shares at
the offering price, giving him a 28% interest after the offering. Summit
Investors paid $55,000 for their 3.1 million shares, or 32% interest. Sales
of additional shares of common stock to the public are subject to a 180 day
underwriter's lockup agreement, although sales of the shares purchased by
the Summit Investors do not become eligible for sale under Rule 144 until
March 1997, unless the SEC amends the Rule to cut the holding period from
two to one years. Such an amendment is under consideration.
   We think the key to the company's growth has been the value added
services which it provides to property managers. Many properties are
heavily leveraged or under capitalized, so maintaining a repair and
maintenance products inventory is just one more headache. The company
solves this problem, and we believe most competing firms do not provide a
similar breadth of products and services.
   We think the company will continue to grow, gaining market share and
forcing out weaker, local firms. It made its first acquisition only last
November at a fraction of the value which the underwriters have placed on
the firm. Other acquisitions at favorable prices are likely to be available
for some time. Geographic expansion and new end market penetration also
present strong growth opportunities. The hospitality, health care, and
institutional markets accounted for only 1.5% of net sales in the first
nine months of 1995. We believe the company covers less than 50% of the
nation currently. On a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition occurred at
the beginning of 1995, we estimate EPS was $0.45 a share on sales of $72.5
million. Pro forma assuming the offering and related transactions occurred
on 1/1/96, we project EPS of $0.60 on sales of $90 million. It is still
early in the IPO cycle for outsourcing firms, which typically means that
the success of the first offering raises the valuation standard until the
quality of firms looking to capitalize on the trend deteriorates. We
recommend purchase of the shares as a short term holding with a price
target of 15.

NEW ISSUES - FYI INC. IPO

   Simultaneous with the consummation of the offering, this company will
acquire the seven companies, all of which provide document management
services primarily to health care institutions, professional services (such
as legal services) firms, and financial institutions. One or more of the
founding firms provide micrographic services, electronic image processing,
active document and file storage and maintenance, inactive document
archival storage, and information and database management services. These
services are provided for all three target markets.
   In addition, certain of the companies provide medical records release
services to health care institutions, litigation support to professional
services firms, and remittance processing to financial institutions. The
founding companies have been in business an average of 22 years and operate
33 facilities in 21 states. Selling is conducted at the local level,
typically by senior management, but the company expects to add a direct
sales force where appropriate.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay the cash portion of the
purchase price for the founding companies, to repay debt, and for general
corporate purposes including acquisitions. Future acquisitions are likely
to be financed wholly or in part with common stock. Long term debt is
nominal. Negotiations are ongoing with a leading financial institution for
lines of credit in the aggregate amount of $25 million to be used for
additional acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes.
   Insiders will own 39% of the stock after the offering. All of the
stockholders of the company, including the former owners of the founding
companies will be contractually prohibited from selling any of the shares
for a period of two years after the acquisitions are closed. Recently, in
November 1995, Ed H. Bowman, Jr. was appointed CEO of the company. Mr.
Bowman's previous experience was with First Data, HBO & Co., and Andersen
Consulting. Chief Development Officer Thomas C. Walker has been responsible
for the acquisition or divestiture of over 100 businesses over a 29 year
period.
   We think that the value added services which the company provides is a
more attractive business than the archival storage business of Iron
Mountain, another firm which is planning an IPO. Both firms are likely to
benefit from the growing trend for businesses to outsource their document
management operations and from consolidation within the industry. More
importantly, F.Y.I.'s proposed market capitalization is about 1.2X our
projection of 1996 revenues for the founding companies, versus the 2.1X at
which Iron Mountain is seeking to sell shares. Our pro forma combined EPS
estimate for 1995 is $0.85 on revenues of $47.5 million. Assuming
acquisitions add about $10 million in revenue in 1996, we project total
revenues of $65 million and EPS of $0.90 on 37% more shares outstanding. We
recommend purchase of the shares.

Underwriters: Montgomery Securities; William Blair. Offering: 1,900,000
com. shs. (all by the company). Price range: $12 to $14. Shares to be

SGS-THOMSON (STM, 31 1/2, NYSE) SPECIAL SITUATION

By:
John D. Coyle, CFA
January 9, 1996


Investment opinion

   We are recommending the purchase of SGS-THOMSON as a low-risk way to
benefit from the strong demand expected in the semiconductor industry over
the next several years. Semiconductor stocks have been hammered in recent
months as investors have chosen to take profits in light of weaker than
expected results being reported by several companies, and amid signs of
pricing pressures in the highly visible memory segment. However, we do not
believe these factors portend an overall slowdown in the market, but rather
reflect isolated pockets of weakness in certain segments of the industry.
   SGS-THOMSON should continue to prosper in this uncertain environment, as
its product and geographic diversity makes it less susceptible to the risks
of more narrowly focused semiconductor companies. In addition, this
diversity gives us confidence in revenue and earnings visibility, a factor
that should be highly prized by investors during 1996.
   Finally, the volatility seen in the last several months underscores the
need for careful investment selection in this group. As such, we recommend
focusing on stocks that are not overly exposed to one industry or product
line and that can be purchased at a low multiple to future earnings.
SGS-THOMSON meets this criteria at just 7.4X our estimate for 1996 and
should be purchased by investors seeking above-average capital
appreciation.

Overview

   SGS-THOMSON is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips and devices
for a variety of end markets. The company sports a diversified line-up of
some 3000 products that are sold to more than 1500 customers, including
OEMs in the computer systems (27% of sales in 1995's first nine months),
telecommunications (23%), consumer products (19%), industrial (21%) and
automotive (10%) industries. Revenues are also well balanced globally,
with Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Japan accounting for 47%, 25%,
24% and 4%, respectively, of revenues in 1995's first nine months.
   The company's principal focus is on differentiated products (51% of
revenues in 1995's first nine months), a segment which mainly contains
analog and mixed-signal (analog/digital) integrated circuits (ICs). Analog
ICs provide the critical link between electronic systems and a variety of
variables including sound, light, temperature or speed. Mixed-signal
circuits combine analog and digital functionality on a single-chip to
process both analog signals and digital data. During 1994, SGS was the #1
worldwide producer of analog and mixed-signal devices.
   Because of the close relationships needed with customers to design
differentiated products, SGS-THOMSON is less vulnerable to pricing
pressures than commodity producers. In addition, these products have longer
life cycles than commodity devices, are less susceptible to technological
obsolescence and cost less to make as older and more reliable manufacturing
processes can be employed. Market projections are for differentiated
products to grow at a 21% annual growth rate through 1998.
   The balance of SGS's revenues are logic and memories (24% of revenues
in 1995's first nine months), discrete (16%), and standard & commodities
(9%). The company's logic devices, which include microprocessors,
microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs), are generally
differentiated from competitive offerings by patents and specialized
product design skills. In contrast, the company's non-volatile memory
products (EPROMs, EEPROMs, SRAMs, flash memories, chips for smartcards) are
generally considered more commodity in nature and mainly differentiated by
price. The company does not manufacture DRAM memory chips. During 1994, SGS
was the #2 worldwide producer of non-volatile memories.
   SGS-THOMSON Holding II controls 69% of the outstanding shares and is
equally owned by a consortium of French and Italian shareholders that are
indirectly controlled by their respective governments.

Targeted products should help drive top line growth

   Despite its broad-based product portfolio, the company is also well
positioned to benefit from exposure to several promising growth segments in
the semiconductor industry. MPEG (motion picture experts group) chips,
which utilize advanced digital video compression to improve the quality of
video and audio, are gaining widespread acceptance in the fast-growing
multimedia computer segment. The company was the leading worldwide MPEG-2
supplier in 1994 and market forecasts are for the MPEG market to reach $2
billion in 1996, up from $600 million in 1995. The company is also
targeting the fast growing flash memory market. Flash memories can be
erased and reprogrammed electrically without having to be physically
removed from a system, like EPROMs. Because of their flexibility, low cost
and small size, the use of flash memories is expected to proliferate.
According to In-Stat, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based research firm, the flash
memory market is expected to grow 32% in 1996 from about $1.3 billion in
1995. Longer term, we expect the company to benefit from its license
agreement with Cyrix. Under the agreement, the company has the option to
manufacture and sell Cyrix's line of microprocessors, including its highly
touted M1 chip that is set to challenge Intel's Pentium family. Volume
production is set for 1996's second quarter but any meaningful contribution
is more likely to come in the 1997 time frame.

SGS benefiting from strong industry demand

   Revenues and earnings were up 40% and 37%, respectively, in the three
months ended September 30, 1995, and 34% and 32% for the nine month period.
The company has benefited from strong global demand for semiconductors
across all key product categories and geographies. We are estimating
revenue growth of about 25% in 1996, which assumes that the company will
grow in line with projected industry growth rates. The Semiconductor
Industry Association has forecast a 26% increase in worldwide semiconductor
sales for 1996, but we believe the company's growth rate is likely to be
slightly lower due to its lack of exposure to the fast-growing DRAM
market.
   Gross margins have trended down from the 42% rate experienced in 1994
and the first quarter of 1995, mainly due to costs associated with capacity
additions. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by recent management comments
that margins could range between 40% and 42% in 1996. Since margins are
currently at the low end of this range, we have built in some upside in our
forecast with a 41% gross margin estimate.
   The company continues to increase spending at healthy levels in an
effort to keep pace with growing demand. SG&A expenses grew as a percentage
of sales in 1995, excluding a $15 million non-recurring item, owing to
greater marketing efforts. The company continues to spend aggressively on
research and development, a trend we view positively. We expect little
diversion from these spending trends in 1996, and have conservatively
targeted these categories to grow cumulatively at rates slightly below our
25% earnings growth estimate.
   We are forecasting earnings of $4.25 for 1996, up 12% from our $3.80
estimate for 1995. The earnings gain is being restricted by an increase in
the tax rate to 26% from an estimated 20%. In 1995, SGS realized certain 
tax breaks from the initiation of capital expenditure programs in certain
countries. We also expect a 6% increase in the number of shares
outstanding, reflecting the October 1995 public offering of 8.9 million
shares at US$43.50 a share.

Company adding capacity to address demand

   SGS-THOMSON is aggressively expanding manufacturing capacity over the
next several years to meet projected industry demand. The company has
applied 1994 and 1995 investments to three new front-end fabrication
plants, two of which are now in operation. In addition, two older plants
are being converted to process newer and larger wafer sizes. The company is
expected to use the proceeds of US$377 million from its October public
offering to help fund these additions. Capital spending in 1995 is expected
to total some $900 million.

Is it time to buy semiconductor stocks?

   Semiconductor stocks went on a roller coaster ride in 1995, with an
impressive surge seen from the beginning of the year through September. As
tracked by the S&P Semiconductor Index, semiconductor stocks rose by more
than 70% during that time frame. This performance was then followed by
extreme volatility and subsequent profit taking that saw many semiconductor
issues fall by 30% to 40% from their highs. The S&P Semiconductor Index
finished up only 35% for the year. Is the 1995 sell-off a harbinger of
things to come for 1996?
   We don't believe so. Industry fundamentals are in place for selected
semiconductor issues to do very well in 1996. Our bias would be towards the
more broadly diversified companies versus companies that are overly exposed
to a particular industry, customer or product line. Furthermore, we would
stay away from companies specializing on more price-sensitive, commodity
products. We think this criteria is critical as pockets of softness are
beginning to surface in various segments of the market, particularly in the
commodity segment. We do not believe this portends a dramatic decline in
the demand for semiconductors, but rather a pause from the overheated
consumption levels of 1995 and heightened uncertainty about longer term
growth rates in key personal computer and telecommunications industries.
Our view is that growth in these segments will remain strong, although not
at the rates seen in previous years. In addition, the proliferation of
semiconductors in automobiles, electronics and appliances should complement
nicely the growth in PCs and phones. In summary, we expect semiconductor
issues to remain volatile over the next several months, but for investors
to eventually revisit higher quality names that can prosper in this
fast-changing industry.

Valuation

   Valuations on all semiconductor issues have come down dramatically since
the latter part of 1995, and many now sport single-digit P/E multiples on
1996 earnings. While we believe many of these issues warrant this type of
multiple because of imminent pricing pressures and the lack of clean
earnings visibility, other stocks have been unduly punished by overly harsh
investor sentiment towards the group.
   We believe SGS-THOMSON is one of those issues, as its broadly
diversified product line and customer base will prove to be a buffer
against periodic pockets of softness that inevitably surface in end
markets. In our opinion, the company's diversity effectively lowers the
risk of a customer or product driven event slowing sales and earnings
momentum. When coupled with the current low valuation on the shares, SGS is
likely to be an investor favorite when positive sentiment returns to the
group.
   With the shares trading at just 7.4X our 1996 estimate of $4.25 a share
and down from the high of 57 1/2, we see a strong likelihood of P/E
expansion as semiconductor stocks eventually return to favor. Based on our
favorable long term views of the industry, we can easily rationalize a P/E
multiple of 10 on 1996 earnings, giving the shares a value of $42.50, up
33% from current levels. We would also note that this valuation may prove
conservative based on what we view as the company's 15%-20% long term
growth rate. Based on the its low risk profile along with strong underlying
growth prospects, we recommend that investors accumulate the shares for
above average capital gains.

BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL (BTGC, 5 7/8, NASDAQ) EMERGING GROWTH

By:
Thomas Tirney


Investment Opinion

   Bio-Technology General (BTG) is an overlooked biopharmaceutical with
excellent growth potential, several commercialized products, and a
promising drug pipeline. Lead products include BioTropin, authentic human
growth hormone (hGH); and Oxandrin, an anabolic steroid approved in various
indications for weight gain.
   BTG sells hGH overseas; the worldwide hGH market totals about $800
million to $1 billion. The company markets Oxandrin domestically, and U.S.
market could easily top $100 million. Both drugs are still in the early
stages of their product cycle and have yet to capture a meaningful share of
their markets; revenue growth has substantial upside potential. The most
promising pipeline drug is Androtest-SL, a sublingual form of testosterone,
which is being prepared for a New Drug Application with the FDA. 
Androtest-SL will be marketed to hypogonadal males and men with
testosterone deficiencies. The U.S. market is valued at about $625 million
and is growing approximately 16% a year.
   We predict revenue growth of 45%+ through 1997 and estimate earnings in
1995 at break-even, those in 1996 at $0.15 per share, and $0.45 in 1997. 
As BTG turns cash-flow positive in 1996 and with over $12 million in cash,
we doubt the company will see the need to do an offering of shares (all the
rage in biotechs these days) or raise capital through debt.
   Our 12-month price target is $12 based on a reasonable price/earnings
ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. Considering that most publicly traded
biotechnology companies, even 1995's success stories like Agouron
Pharmaceuticals and Cephalon have no immediate earnings expectations nor
any commercial drug products (no P/E's either), Bio-Technology General has
a compelling investment profile based on the fundamentals in this
high-growth, high-risk sector.

Overview

   This small-cap biopharmaceutical develops and manufactures
pharmaceuticals and genetically engineered products. BTG focuses on drugs
that treat endocrinology disorders, cardio/pulmonary diseases, opthalmic,
and skin disorders. Through marketing partners and distribution agreements,
the company sells its products in Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Canada,
the U.S. and Mexico.
   BTG's flagship drug is called Bio-Tropin, human growth hormone (hGH),
and is used to treat short stature, growth hormone deficiency, and
dwarfism. hGH is secreted from the pituitary gland and controls important
physiological functions essential to normal development and maturation. The
worldwide market for hGH is very large, estimated between $850 million and
$1 billion, and growing by about 10% each year. The major geographic
markets are the U.S. with a $300 million market potential, Western Europe
at $250 million, and Japan, slightly less than the U.S. Currently, BTG is
selling Bio-Tropin in Western Europe and Japan through licensees, as well
as in other smaller markets in East Asia and Latin America.
   Bio-Tropin accounted for approximately $7.2 million of BTG revenues in
1994 (65% of the total) mostly through sales in Japan by licensee JCR
Pharmaceuticals. JCR began selling Bio-Tropin in mid-1993 and is starting
to make inroads on capturing a more significant portion of the Japanese
market. Sales contributions from its Western Europe market was slight in
1994, as its licensee, the Ferring Group, had a late start: sales to the
Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden commenced in 4Q 1994. During late 1995,
Ferring started selling in the U.K., France, Spain, Denmark, Belgium,
Ireland, and Luxembourg. The 1995 comparisons in both the Japan and Western
Europe market have been very favorable and as Bio-Tropin is still in a
``launch stage'', projected growth rates are high. We estimate BioTropin
sales from Japan in 1995 at $11 million and will grow about 15% through
1997. In Western Europe, revenue contributions will approximate $2.3
million in 1995 and grow at 45%+ through 1997.

Problems with BioTropin in the United States may have clouded investors'
perception of the stock

   Unfortunately, BioTropin's biggest and most lucrative market, the United
States, is closed off . After obtaining FDA approval to market Bio-Tropin
in the United States, Genentech filed a suit claiming patent infringement
and was able to prevent BTG from selling its hGH domestically. Genentech
is, of course, trying to preserve market share of its own hGH drugs in
America. In August 1995, Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical was also
slapped with a preliminary injunction by Genentech when it tried to sell
hGH products in the U.S., as well. BTG has appealed the ruling and expects
a decision by March 1996. Although there is a good chance that the company
could succeed in overturning the injunction, we are not including the
possibility of U.S. sales in our earnings model. Whatever happens with
the court case, we believe that Bio-Technology's present markets for
Bio-Tropin as well as revenues from other products will promulgate adequate
earnings growth in 1996 without U.S. sales.

Oxandrin addresses an underserved and growing market

   The problems related to Bio-Tropin has muddied the waters in relation to
the company's other promising products. In the unfolding of Genentech's
injunction, investors have forgotten about Oxandrin, BTG's approved drug
for weight gain. Oxandrin is an anabolic steroid used in patients suffering
from severe weight loss (``wasting syndrome'') due to chronic infection,
extensive surgery, or trauma. Wasting syndrome, clinically known as
cachexia, is a metabolic disruption frequently occurring in patients with a
compromised immune system. Cachexia causes the body to break down protein
stores to meet energy requirements rather than first using stores of fat.
The combination of losing body weight and muscle mass in a seriously ill
patient leads to a life threatening condition.
   Oxandrin has distinct advantages over the current crop of therapies used
in wasting syndrome. Megace, an injectable anabolic steroid, has a higher
liver toxicity profile and also may lead to androgenic effects in female
patients. Megace has also demonstrated limited efficacy in weight gain
through adding lean muscle mass. Weight gain with Megace adds mostly water
and fat. Human growth hormone, while effective in adding weight, is
prohibitively expensive at over $50,000 per treatment year. Reimbursement
for hGH in this indication is not expected by many insurance companies nor
from state Medicaid or AIDS Drug Assistance programs. Oxandrin on the other
hand, can be taken orally, halts weight loss, adds lean muscle mass, and
costs about $20 per daily dosage (roughly $6,000 per treatment year).
   Oxandrin, as discussed, is already approved for a variety of
indications. Additionally, BTG is trying to expand the labeling of Oxandrin
through Treatment Investigative New Drug trials. Treatment IND status
allows the company to be reimbursed during the trial. A Phase III
Treatment IND trial in AIDS cachetic patients is going forward in 1996 and
a Treatment IND trial for Turners Syndrome has already been completed. The
Treatment IND could ideally generate a revenue stream of $8 million
although our forecasts are more conservative at $5 million in 1996. 
Approximately 75,000 AIDS patients in the United States are cachetic.
   Severe weight loss is not just a symptom of AIDS patients. Cancer and
aging are two vast markets in which Oxandrin can easily be adopted. BTG has
a dialogue with medical specialists treating wasting conditions and
oncologists concerning Oxandrin's use. Cachetic cancer patients number
between 250,000 to 400,000 in the United States alone. We believe the
current labeling of Oxandrin will allow it to be given to cachetic cancer
patients.
   In November 1995, Bio-Technology General announced an alliance with
Quantum Health Resources to distribute Oxandrin nationally. Quantum's
therapies and services are provided through four regional centers, 20
licensed branches, and 17 service branches throughout the United States. 
Quantum's expertise is in long-term chronic disorders and specialized
disease management where the needs of patients differ markedly from acute
or short-term illnesses. Due to Quantum's recent problems with its mainstay
hemophilia service unit, we believe Quantum will place a strong emphasis
on growing Oxandrin business.

BioLon's smaller revenue contributions round out BTG's drug portfolio

   BioLon is a sodium hyaluronate product used in cataract surgery and
intraocular lens transplantation. It is a high-viscosity, gel-like fluid
which also has applications in dry eye syndrome and as a general contact
lens solution. Marketing partners sell BioLon in Canada, Spain, South
Korea, India, Mexico, and Israel. Labaoratoire Chauvin is launching BioLon
in Europe during 1996 and a New Drug Application is planned to be filed in
the U.S. Upjohn-Pharmacia sells hyaluronic acid in the United States under
the trade name Healon. Healon goes off patent in February 1996. Revenue
growth from BioLon will come principally from the U.S. and to a lesser
extent, Europe. Although competition will no doubt be fierce, revenue
contributions from BioLon will approximate $4 million in 1996 and about $6
million in 1997.

Androtest-SL represents the company's most promising pipeline drug

   This pipeline drug is a sublingual form of testosterone that is absorbed
in the bloodstream through the mucosal membrane under the tongue.
Androtest-SL is designed to treat hypogonadism, a testosterone deficiency
that affects about 250,000 males in the United States alone. Androtest-SL
is also being developed to treat delay of growth and puberty which affects
about 80,000 boys (U.S. market). Hypogonadal males, either through a
constitutional deficiency or through aging, suffer lower testosterone
levels which leads to impotence, suppressed libido, and loss of muscle
mass.
   Current therapies include testosterone injections, scrotal patches, and
transdermal patches attached to the upper thighs and stomach area. While
the intramuscular injections are being abandoned in favor of the new
transdermal patches (such as those marketed by Theratech and Alza), we
believe that Androtest-SL will provide an even more convenient alternative
for hypogonadal males. The obvious disadvantage that transdermal patches
have compared to injections is delivery. However, the patch must be worn
constantly which may lead to irritation and discomfort. As an oral tablet
taken three times a day, Androtest-SL provides a convenient alternative to
patches and painful injection.
   The drug has proved effective in Phase III trials and is being prepared
for registration with the FDA. An NDA filing is expected at the latest by
mid-1996 with sales commencing as early as mid-1997. Androtest-SL has
Orphan Drug status for constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Like the
Oxandrin market, the hypogonadal market is a segment that hasn't been
properly addressed in the past. Competing transdermal patch companies like
Alza and Theratech are attempting to expand this market for men with
impotency, mild testosterone deficiency, and males that experience lower
testosterone levels because of aging. Under this criteria, the expanded
market numbers between 3 million and 5 million males in the United States.
But even without such indications, Androtest-SL's ease of use and
competitive profile may help it capture as much as $12 million in revenues
when marketing commences in 1997.
   BioTropin, Oxandrin, BioLon, and Androtest-SL constitute the products
which will generate earnings growth in the next five years. Other products
currently being sold include psoriasis treatment, Silkis, sold in Europe
through marketing partner Cilag S.A. and Delatestryl, an injectible
testosterone product being phased out in favor of Androtest-SL. Aside from
Androtest-SL, drugs in development include Porcine Growth Hormone for the
production of leaner pork products; OxSODrol (Phase II/III trials) for the
prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns; and Bio-Hep-B, a
third generation vaccine against the hepatitis B virus.

Financial summary and valuation

   We're expecting Bio-Technology General to post break-even numbers when
it reports its fourth quarter and year-end results sometime in February
1996. Third quarter 1995 net income was $0.00 per share, which excluded an
extraordinary gain of $0.03 due to debt forgiveness. Bio-Technology General
reached a major turning point in 1995 as its revenues (including interest
income) matched its expenses and the company demonstrated the ability to go
forward in 1996 as a profitable company.
   The company will probably have a burn-rate of approximately $5 million
for 1995 and end the year with about $12 million cash and equivalents. With
only half a million in long-term liabilities and nearly $15 million in
working capital, the company has a credible balance sheet. We are
predicting earnings of $0.15 in 1996 and $0.45 in 1997 broken out in Table
1.
   In 1996, the company will be cash flow positive and will probably not
need to raise substantial capital in the form of a secondary offering or
debt. Also, resources for marketing and sales infrastructure are already
in place along with several international marketing partnerships. BTG has
bypassed the dilemma that many biotechs meet when products are approved
without a sales force to market them. However, should the opportunity
present itself and market conditions prove favorable, we would view a
secondary offering as a positive development since BTG would be issuing
shares from a position of financial strength.
   Both administrative and R&D expenses have been pared down in recent
years as management has made a commitment to keep operating costs
well-controlled. Expenses in both categories will increase modestly in
1996 and 1997. The company also has over $50 million in net operating loss
carryforwards which expire from 1996 through 2009, therefore no provisions
for income tax has been made in our earnings model.
   We think that Bio-Technology General is an overlooked biopharmaceutical
with excellent growth potential and a robust pipeline unusual for a
small-cap concern. Its products meet the needs of immature, underserved
markets and possesses a fundamental investment profile in a sector
notorious for pie-in-the-sky prospects. Our one year price target is $12.00
based on a price/earnings ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. The ratio reflects
an average of generic drug companies' and pharmaceutical p/e ratios. We
are using a we strongly recommend purchase of the shares.

Minimum of four IPOs added to S&P New Issues Index; closed end funds
excluded.

It may come as a surprise to many investors that both the number and dollar
volume of new issues brought out in 1995 slightly trailed year earlier
levels. Last year, 489 IPOs were added to S&P's New Issues Index, compared
with 496 the year before, while total dollars raised came to $31.1 billion,
compared with $34.0 billion in 1994. Both years significantly trailed the
record 672 deals and $56.9 billion raised in 1993. Despite the fireworks
surrounding many technology deals, they are typically smaller than those
for mature companies reentering the market via a reverse LBO or ADRs, REITs
or closed end funds, which were popular offerings at various times over the
last 10 years. Despite some highly visible reverse LBOs and ADRs such as
Nabisco Holdings, Royal PTT Nederland, ENI, Canadian National Railways,
AVX, Gucci Group and Estee Lauder, there were fewer reverse LBOs and ADRs
on the IPO roster last year.
   With the economy slowing down, there were many industries that were off
limits to underwriters during the year. Financials and technology were in,
but heavy industry, basic materials, consumer durables and consumer
nondurables were out. With overall market leadership narrow, underwriters
had to concentrate their energies in the few in-favor industries.
   Although the year ended with a bang, with $14.0 billion raised from 201
deals during the last quarter, we believe that both the number and dollars
raised in 1996 will be slightly lower than last year's totals. Standard &
Poor's is of the view that the total return of the S&P 500 will be less
than double digits and that intermediate term fixed income investments
could provide similar returns over the next 12 months. With the economy
exhibiting sluggish growth and interest in technology temporarily on the
wane, we think that underwriters will easily be able to beat the 61 deals
and $3.7 billion raised in the first quarter of 1995. That was when the
market was treading water while waiting for interest rates to level off.
Comparisons, however, will get tougher as the year wears on. Should the
economy show signs of picking up, a number of offerings could surface in
specialty retailing and consumer products and services.

Telecommunications equipment and Internet plays were the big winners

   The S&P New Issues Index almost doubled in value last year, its best
performance since 1991, when it rose 106.1%. It finished 1995 up 96.5%. The
index tracks the performance of new issues, including REITs and closed end
funds, for the first six months of trading. To be added to the index, IPOs
must be firm underwritings priced at or above $5, with an offering
capitalization of at least $5 million. We exclude bank and S&L conversions,
best efforts deals and unit deals that include warrants. The index is price
weighted.
   Fully 62 deals more than doubled last year based on offering price and
what they closed the year at. Another 77 rose more than 50%. Before you
get the idea that buying IPOs is like shooting fish in a barrel, though, it
should be pointed out that 135 deals fell in value, while another 109 rose
less than 20%. Put together, they amount to 50% of all deals brought last
year.
   The biggest winner was Premisys Communications, which sextupled in less
than nine months. The company makes integrated multiple access servers and
concentrators that support prevailing centrex and digital switch
technologies as well as emerging frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode
(ATM) technologies. Its products allow the proliferation of frame relay
based ISDN services within a traditional broadband network structure. Right
now it is delivering just about the only ATM concentrator around. Revenues
for the September quarter rose 149%, while earnings quintupled to $0.25.
AT&T is its major customer and accounts for a third of revenues. One danger
is that when AT&T splits up, the new entity that makes equipment may choose
a different vendor, or more likely, other more traditional switch
manufacturers will catch up technologically and cause profit margins,
currently quite high, to eventually come down. The shares are currently
trading at 80X consensus projected fiscal 1996 EPS.
   Three of the next four winners were Internet plays, Spyglass, Netscape
Communications and UUNET Technologies. Spyglass more than quintupled, NSCP
almost quadrupled, and UNET more than tripled. These companies went public
so early in their corporate lives that one could only conjecture as to how
fast they might grow. All three are trading at multiples quantum leaps
higher than just about any other non-Internet related or biotech growth
stock.
   We are of the view that the Internet will be the dominant mass
communications medium in the 21st century. Nonetheless, once forward five
year sales and earnings growth rates for these companies become defined,
their share prices will be adjusted downward. In the meantime, shares of
Netscape, the company with the best shot at becoming a dominant player in
Internet services, is trading at over 20X projected 1997 revenues!
   Just about all the other big winners were technology related. There were
nine software companies among the 25 biggest winners, plus three
telecommunications related companies. The only exceptions were Renters
Choice, Compdent, Sequana Therapeutics, Garden Ridge and Spin-Tech.
   PDT makes light activated drugs to treat or diagnose a variety of
diseases. The company has yet to generate revenues or a profit, but it is
entering phase III trials for a drug to be used on hard tumors. DSP
Communications is developing chipsets for wireless personal communications
applications. To date, sales have come from chipsets for Japanese digital
mobile phones. Customers include Kenwood, Kyocera and Sanyo. Renters Choice
runs 325 rent-to-own stores. Nine month earnings more than doubled on a 60%
increase in sales. Verity is a maker of tools for the dissemination of
texts over various electronic networks. Although the company is still
running losses, revenues are up substantially. Greatest interest is in its
Topoc search engine for the Internet.

As usual, small deals done by third tier underwriters populate losers list

   The largest deal that landed on our losers list was Asia Pacific
Resources. It has a 60.7% interest in a major Indonesian producer of pulp
and rayon and almost wholly owns another firm that operates the largest
single line pulp mill in the world. Three paper mills are planned, two in
China and one in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the company has not earned much
money since going public in early April. With economies slowing in most
major markets, the company could be expanding capacity at just the wrong
time.
   Electronics Communications provides cellular phone services and
equipment. Sales dropped over the last nine months, with operations going
to a loss due to one-time advertising charges. AHI Healthcare Systems
integrates individual physicians and small medical groups into local
managed healthcare delivery networks. Although revenues more than doubled
in the nine months to 9/30/95, a larger than expected loss was reported due
to high development costs. Losses are expected to continue for at least one
more quarter.
   Other losers brought by large underwriters include HighwayMaster
Communications. It offers a wireless communications network for use by
truckers. Although revenues rose substantially of late, losses failed to
narrow. Number Nine Visual Technology initially received a very favorable
reception by investors. This maker of graphics accelerator products for
personal computers continues to show a very positive sales trend, but a
loss was reported for the September quarter. Analysts expected earnings of
$0.25 a share.
   Many of the worst losers were brought out by small underwriters such as
Investors Associates, Hampshire Securities, John G. Kinnard, Needham & Co.,
Paulson Investments, Lexington Securities, and J.W. Charles. Small sole
underwritings tend to do well initially, but then tail off rapidly as time
goes on. Most of these deals have generally weak underlying fundamentals,
but are operating in industries that are currently in favor. The
underwriter insures success at the IPO by developing more than enough
demand to float the shares at the offering, and those that are retail
oriented often drive the share price higher by convincing its clients to
buy additional shares in the aftermarket. Then the underwriter moves on to
the next deal. Lacking sponsorship and with a market capitalization too
small to hit the radar screens of most buy side managers, the offerings
inevitably drift lower.
   Salomon Brothers brought out three deals that found their way on the
losers list, as did Alex. Brown. Even the most successful underwriters,
however, bring out companies that falter due to subsequent poorer than
expected results. Some deals that initially moved higher before plummeting
included Business Resource Group, Number Nine Visual Technology, Hello
Direct, TGV Software and EqualNet Holdings.

Goldman Sachs dominates list of biggest deals

   Of the 10 largest deals, Goldman, Sachs kept the books on six of them.
No one else had more than one in the top 10. Goldman's largest deal was
Nabisco Holdings, which went public early in the year. It advanced 33.2% in
value by year end. Other large Goldman deals were Prudential Reinsurance,
PMI Group, Intimate Brands, Canadian National Railway and Borders Group.
Morgan Stanley's largest deal was Royal PTT Nederland, which edged up 2.4%
in the last five weeks of the year, Smith Barney's was Union Pacific
Resources, up 20.8% in less than three months, CS First Boston's was ENI,
rising 4.2% in five weeks, and Merrill Lynch's was DST Systems, which
advanced 35.7% in two months.
   The best performer in the aftermarket among the 10 largest deals was
Prudential Reinsurance, which advanced 39.6% by year end. The runner-up was
DST Systems. Large deals with offering capitalizations of more than $100
million that rose more than 30% are on page 11.

As usual, technology and white shoe underwriters lead in IPO aftermarket 
    performance

   Technology, regional and white shoe underwriters usually lead the pack
in bringing out the most successful offerings, and 1995 was no exception.
Rauscher Pierce leads the list. Of its four deals, one, Renters Choice,
tripled, while another, Belmont Homes, doubled. Other regional houses that
brought out excellent deals were William Blair and Robinson-Humphrey.
   The major specialty technology underwriters, as usual, brought out deals
that did much better than average in subsequent trading. Alex. Brown,
Montgomery, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson, Stephens all served both
investors and corporate clients in pricing their deals well. As is also the
norm, second tier technology underwriters such as Needham & Co., Miller,
Johnson, Kuehn, and Unterberg Harris, for the most part brought out weaker
than average deals when they took the lead. The exceptions this year were
Cowen & Co. and Volpe, Welty.
   Salomon Brothers has been struggling to remain a major underwriter of
equity issues. The poor performance of their deals in the aftermarket in
1995 will not make their task any easier going forward. The multi-office
retail brokers typically bring out poorer performing deals. PaineWebber has
landed in the lower half of the list for many years and appears there
again, as does Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Smith Barney and Donaldson
Lufkin. There were no exceptions to the rule this year.
   The most deals were brought by Goldman, Sachs, followed by Robertson,
Stephens, Alex. Brown, and Morgan Stanley. Both Goldman, Sachs and Morgan
Stanley have consistently brought out better than average deals. Of
Goldman's 36 IPOs, only six finished the year under water. Just five of
Morgan Stanley's offerings finished under their IPO prices.

Sector rotation likely in 1996

   From an investment perspective, over the next six months or so, we would
emphasize those groups that could generate strong corporate earnings growth
regardless of how the overall economy does. They include health care,
(particularly HMOs and subacute care companies), energy services (the
drillers), REITs, insurance, computer networking, telecommunications
equipment, and farm related businesses.
   We may also see more foreign stocks. Many emerging markets could turn in
better performances than the U.S. in 1996. Our bets are on the Czech
Republic, Argentina, Chile and the Philippines. Following on the heels of
Gucci, we would also expect an increased number of ADR offerings of family
owned consumer product companies based in Europe.
   With technology stocks in a deep freeze, many IPOs in this sector will
be postponed until the climate improves. That may not be until later in the
year. In the meantime, it appears that value could beat growth in a market
environment in which the total return of the S&P 500 this year may not
reach its long term average of 10.1%.
   At least for the first quarter, we would emphasize low P/E plays. Of the
tech companies that do venture forth in this environment, they are apt to
be better priced. Although they may not move much in the immediate
aftermarket, they could do well when technology comes back into favor,
possibly late this year.
   Groups we would not commit additional funds to now would be personal
computer related technology, cyclicals, nonprecious metals, and consumer
finance stocks.

C-CUBE MICROSYSTEMS

   A two-for-one split was paid to shareholders of C-Cube Microsystems on
December 19, 1995. The shares, now 48% higher than in November last year
when we upgraded them from hold to buy, are a bit off from their recent
all-time high of 65 (post split). The stock is likely to be quite volatile
along with the technology sector as other firms report earnings for the
fourth quarter. For this reason, we are lowering the shares (CUBE, 53 5/16,
NASDAQ) from buy to hold on continued positive long term fundamentals.
C-Cube reports earnings for 1995 on January 18, 1995.

SMALLCAP-NEW ISSUE MARKET REVIEW

By:
Robert S. Natale, CFA
Editor

The tug of war between value and growth goes on

   Last year, growth beat value. The growth half of the S&P 500 provided a
total return of 38.1%, as measured by S&P/BARRA, while the value half of
the index generated 37.0%. But, for the five years ended 12/31/95, value
generated a 16.9% compound annual total return, against 16.1% for growth.
In 1996, value could again have the edge. With P/Es well above the
historical norm and economic growth slowing down, investors are seeking to
reduce perceived investment risks by searching out less expensive stocks in
industries that have not already run up. Indeed, we would be looking to
place money in industries that run on their own operating cycles, that is,
that are less affected by what is going on in the overall economy.
   For example, oil service companies, especially the drillers, stand to
benefit from increased exploration expenditures by the major oil companies
this year. That is because new technologies such as 3-D seismic and
horizontal drilling have reduced finding costs, making the redevelopment of
older fields and of new small fields economical. In addition, after 10
years of depression, the supply of oil rigs is finally coming into balance
with demand. Day rates rose substantially last year even though natural gas
prices plummeted and oil prices went nowhere. Our favorites here are Global
Marine and Nabors Industries.
   Another group attractive to value and growth players alike is health
care. New rules coming out of Washington, D.C. could adversely impact
hospital and nursing home businesses, but the drive to reduce per capita
costs will push increased use of subacute rehabilitation services and
Medicare and Medicaid patients into HMOs. We have three rehab companies on
our buy list, Mariner Health Group, RehabCare Group, and TheraTx. All are
trading at or below the market multiple as measured by the S&P 500. HMOs on
our buy list are Pacificare Health Systems and United American Healthcare.
   Semiconductor companies now look like value plays in the sense that they
now sport low P/Es despite prospects for above average, albeit somewhat
cyclical, earnings growth. Many on our buy lists have been beaten up of
late and offer considerable appeal for investors looking beyond the
uncertainties surrounding the industry as excess inventories are worked
down. Industry growth this year will not match the 40% increase in
worldwide shipments experienced in 1995; 26% will be more like it. Still,
that should more than justify a recovery in P/E ratios. In addition to
SGS-Thomson, which is recommended in this issue, we like Exar, which makes
lower end application specific integrated circuits, Integrated Circuits,
which manufactures mixed signal Ics, and Sierra Semiconductor, which is
supplying chips to fast growing ATM and frame relay telecommunications
switch makers. All of these companies are trading at single digit multiples
against current forecasted 1996 EPS.
   We also suggest taking another look at real estate plays. With Standard
& Poor's predicting the total return for the S&P 500 to be less that 10% in
1996, REITs could provide comparable or better returns with less risk.
Except for retail properties, real estate values continue to climb,
particularly for office properties. Our favorites in this area include
Catellus Development, an almost pure play on the California recovery, First
Union Real Estate Trust, which has one of the lowest dividend payouts as a
percent of cash flow in the REIT industry, which bodes well for steady
dividend increases over the next 18 months, and Property Capital Trust,
which is liquidating, and we feel will provide a total return well into the
double digits as it does so over the next three to five years.
   Other industries that we would target for investment, either through
IPOs or otherwise, are domestic farming (i.e. Case and Tractor Supply,
insurance, and telecommunications equipment (Stratacom, Sierra
Semiconductor).
   Finally, some leading emerging foreign markets should also provide
better returns than the S&P 500 in 1996. We would play them via listed
closed end funds. Our favorites are Czech Republic Fund and First
Philippine Fund.
   Despite the weak start to the year by small stocks, we continue to
believe that they will beat the S&P 500 this year. Earnings growth for
companies in the SmallCap 600 is projected to be much stronger than the S&P
500 in 1996, while the P/E ratios of small stocks are only slightly higher.
Although investors are very unlikely to garner the same returns achieved in
1995, small stocks should provide excellent relative returns in 1996.
