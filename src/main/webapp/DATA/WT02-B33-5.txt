JANUARY CONTESTS TO KICK OFF RETURN TO GROWTH
Within Days: ILFC, Malaysian, South African, Philippines

Even though 1996 is shaping up as the first genuine growth year for
commercial aircraft enginemakers this decade, many of the biggest campaigns
will be decided much sooner - by month's end, the market share landscape
for General Electric, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce may be dramatically
altered.
   Top marketing executives from all three enginemakers tell AP that as
they look ahead this year, it's clear that 1995's optimism wasn't
misplaced. A few carriers are poised to make major decisions on big
turbofans for large aircraft this month, and many other key competitions
involving GE's GE90 and CF6, P&W's PW4000 Series and Rolls-Royce's Trent
and RB211-535 will probably be decided early in the year.
   In some cases, numbers are still being worked out. But right now engine
marketeers are fighting hard to power aircraft for Air India, International
Lease Finance Corp., Delta, Air China, China Airlines, South African
Airways, Malaysian Air System and Philippine Air Lines. In addition, while
not officially in the market for new aircraft, insiders say American
Airlines, Northwest Airlines, TWA and Continental are all hot prospects for
1996.

any day now
   Marketing executives describe many of the deals as being at the "any-
day-now" stage, among them Air India, which may buy 10 firm plus 13 option
Boeing 777s or McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijets, and South African Airways,
looking at ways to power six firm and 10 option 777s. Malaysian Air System,
expected this week to announce plans to buy as many as 25 long-range Boeing
jetliners, 777s and 747-400s, is also close to choosing engines and may
unveil its engine decision along with its aircraft decision.
   International Lease Finance Corp., which is reportedly looking at around
a "dozen" Airbus A330 widebody twins, along with perhaps 18 to 20 777s, is
seen by many as making up its mind before the end of January. Airbus, on
the losing end of 1995's market share battle after a triumphant 1994, was
pushing hard for a decision before the end of December, but ILFC chief
Steven Hazy has reportedly signaled that mid- to late-January is a more
likely date.
   "The other one right behind it is Delta," which wants to start phasing
out its elderly Lockheed L-1011 trijets, says one of Rolls-Royce's
marketing chiefs. The first few retirements will probably be replaced by
exercising existing options on Boeing 757s. But sometime this quarter the
carrier is expected to declare the competition open, at which time "they
will be looking at a longer-term replacement for the Tri-Star," he says.
That evaluation could take some time, running into 1996's fourth quarter.
   A few 1996 contests are active without actually being declared, among
them American Airlines and Delta.
   "Don't expect a selection" at American in 1996, "but a lot of
posturing," says a GE executive. "American has stated their desire for
777s, and that will probably be considered by the aircraft and enginemakers
as a campaign."
   Still, tight-fisted American Chairman Bob Crandall has also made it
clear that he won't buy an airplane - ever - unless he can make it cost
less than anything he's already operating, which at least one marketeer
thinks may be too tall an order. "Crandall's party line is no new
airplanes," a Rolls executive adds, although "we continue to update them
every couple of months on the progress of the Trent, and we visit them
regularly in hopes that we are positioning the Trent" as a credible
candidate whenever an evaluation finally gets underway.
   Northwest, already on the list to start receiving Airbus A330 twins, is
reportedly quietly in the market for 777 twins this year, and Boeing thinks
there's a niche for a few 777s at that airline. All three enginemakers are
expected to make the trek to Eagan, Minn., within three to four weeks to
show off GE90s, PW4084s and Trent 800s.
   Egyptair has been in the best-and-final offer stage for engines to power
its three Boeing 777s for months, and at least two of the enginemakers say
they've "won" the competition three times. With spares, and the relatively
high margins produced by small, non-launch customers, Egyptair could be
worth about $800 million to the winning enginemaker within the next few
weeks.
   Like Delta, TWA hopes to start replacing L-1011 Tri-Stars, but engine
industry executives expect the carrier to use the decision this year as an
opportunity to get smaller, cashing in the airplanes in favor of a mix of
Boeing 767 widebodies and 757 narrowbodies. America West and Continental
are also in the market for additional Boeing 757s, a market where Pratt &
Whitney's PW2000 competes with Rolls' RB211-535.

'controlled growth'
   "When you look at what the environment is, traffic and revenues are
fairly strong, and...airlines are starting to see some of the results" of
previous years' cost-cutting, says a Rolls executive. As a result, airlines
now feel better about returning to a buying mode, but executives agree that
you won't see a return to the buying frenzy of the mid-1980s.
   "If there's one word that summarizes it, it's controlled growth," he
says. "There's still some caution at the airlines about adding new
aircraft, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there's a
heavy debt load out there. Let's face it, towards the end of the '90s there
could be another cycle downturn, plus you've got a lot of pilot issues out
there."
   In addition, some of the euphoria will begin to wear off as marketing
efforts shift from the Far East - where new aircraft, especially widebody
twins, have been selling like crazy to newly cash-rich airlines - to Europe
and North America, where carriers are healthy again, but chastened.
   That may mean a cooling off period from 1995's new order growth rate,
which outpaced 1994's nearly four times over. But cool doesn't mean cold,
and the enginemakers remain optimistic about prospects in North America and
Europe.
   "On big twins, very few people in Europe and North America made a move"
in recent years, remarks one P&W executive. "The wave of big twins sweeping
through Asia is already decided...and the next wave has probably got to go
through Europe and North America.
   "The big twin market race is not over," he declares, and the 777 "is not
just an Asian airplane. Boeing has hit a home-run with this airplane."

BOEING RATE HIKES SIGNAL JETLINER RECOVERY
Faster Ramp-Up For 777; Previous Cut-Back Plans Reversed

   Enginemakers looking for hard evidence of recovery need look no further
than Seattle: Boeing is boosting jetliner production rates for the first
time in three years, and should reach 24 aircraft per month by early 1997
as 777 production rises faster than originally planned.
   Apart from the 757 long-range narrowbody, Boeing reports rates will rise
across the board - 737 and 777 come in for the biggest hike - and
management is putting off a planned 757 decrease for three months. By the
fourth quarter of 1996 Boeing should be building 22.5 aircraft per month,
rising to 24 when the 777, which entered service last spring, reaches full
speed.
   The rate hike is partly to catch up after a two-month Machinists'
strike. But it also reflects a fundamental recovery in the jetliner
marketplace, and it led the company to sound its most optimistic tone about
production since the 1990s began.
   "This is a positive sign to see the beginning of an upswing in
production rates," says Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President Ron
Woodard. "It reflects the turnaround that our customers are experiencing
and underscores the positive long-term outlook for our industry."
   Rates on the 737, originally expected to slip from today's seven per
month to five next April, will instead rise to 8.5 per month by the fourth
quarter of 1996. Production of 747s will rise from two per month to 3.5 in
the fourth quarter, while 757 production will hold at four aircraft per
month until September, 1996, when the rate goes to three. At the same time,
767 production will rise by half an airplane, to four per month.
   Boeing is also ramping up 777 widebody twin rates faster than originally
projected. The company was going to build three 777s each month throughout
1996 and then boost the rate to four per month in 1997. But yesterday
Boeing said it would build 3.5 777s each month by the third quarter of
1996, and will build five per month in early 1997.
   Even with two quarters of recovery under its belt this year, Boeing
originally planned to cut production back. Through the first half of 1995
the company booked 25% more orders than it had through all of 1994, but the
new orders wouldn't have started paying off until 1997 or later, and Boeing
was supposed to remain stuck at 17.5 planes per month until at least 1997.
   Management now thinks rates should recover to 20 aircraft per month
during the first quarter of 1996. Boeing describes this as "pre-strike
levels," suggesting that non-strike rates never actually hit the 17.5-plane
nadir originally forecast, although during the strike the company barely
managed to push out a dozen planes a month.
   "Boeing...continues to work with customers on the specific delivery
timing following the strike," the company says in a prepared statement
detailing the new production rates, and expects to project total 1996
deliveries before the end of January.
   Peak deliveries came in 1992, when Boeing built 441 aircraft at a rate
of better than 36 planes a month.

GE90 MAY NEED MORE TESTS TO WIN EARLY ETOPS
Teething Problems, FAA Discomfort Combine To Move The Goalposts

   Officials on the FAA's Reliability Assessment Board - the body that
gives thumbs-up or down to enginemakers' requests for ETOPS clearance -
will probably give General Electric the go-ahead this month to begin its
crucial 1,000-cycle flight test series on the GE90, but early extended twin
operations clearance probably won't be granted without additional ground
test runs, sources tell AP.
   It's widely believed that board members and U.S. airworthiness
authorities remain uncomfortable with the concept of early long-range twin
clearance, particularly in the face of pressure from even more skeptical
European counterparts. One source says that at least four out of seven
board members, when asked to produce a draft of their decision on GE90 in
October, came down against early ETOPS.
   And a surge during an acceptance flight last month for a GE90-powered
British Airways 777 - embarrassingly, less than a week before GE was due to
appear before the board to prove the GE90 was reliable enough to go on to
the next phase of testing - didn't help. That surge held up deliveries of
BA's second and third airplanes, although FAA late last month okayed a
proposal to modify fan tip clearances just on BA's GE90s as an interim
solution to expedite deliveries.

clearance modification
   A GE spokesman tells AP this week that British Airways now has its
second aircraft, and the third should be delivered before the middle of
this month. Aircraft already in service will get the clearance modification
sometime in mid-January "as a precaution," he says.
   But are all these troubles enough to scupper early ETOPS? Probably not,
airworthiness authorities in the U.S. and Europe privately concede. At the
same time, however, regulators point out that the GE90 design has been
tweaked several times over the past half year, and another set of ground
runs is "probably not a bad idea," says one U.S. official.
   If the word from the board is to go for more tests, the answer needs to
come soon - the 1,000 cycle ETOPS test will take about four months to run,
a period of time during which additional ground runs could be done without
jeopardizing delivery dates or promises on winning the extended- range
clearance. After that, some delay would be inevitable, and that could cost
GE millions of dollars.

THIOKOL, CARLYLE CLOSE ON HOWMET FOR $750 MILLION
Rocket-maker Could Own Howmet Outright By 1999

   Rocket-maker Thiokol and aerospace-heavy merchant bank The Carlyle Group
closed last month on their joint purchase of gas turbine components and
repair giant Howmet Corp. for $750 million.
   "The new owners support Howmet's management philosophy and the direction
we are taking the company," says Howmet President and CEO David Squire.
"With their encouragement, we will continue to sharpen our focus on serving
customers, while pursuing the many growth opportunities that lie before
us."
   As in many other deals completed with Carlyle's help, Carlyle will hold
the majority stake but stands ready to sell it to Thiokol after three
years. The deal's structure means that despite the $750 million purchase
price and 49% initial Thiokol stake in the new Howmet, the cash effect to
Thiokol is only $100 million. Thiokol and Carlyle will each put up $100
million, financing the $550 million balance with non-recourse debt and the
issuance of preferred stock.
   With headquarters in Greenwich, Conn. and 30 plants around the world,
Howmet specializes in making and refurbishing precision investment castings
for gas turbines used on aircraft and in industrial applications, as well
as component repairs for ground-based gas turbines.

UTC CHIEF DAVID HINTS AT ENGINE, HELO ACQUISITIONS
Lack Of Candidates Has Been Obstacle

   Despite hot rumors, United Technologies Corp. isn't interested in
selling its aerospace units, says UTC chief George David, but the company
would look long and hard at acquisitions, particularly anything that could
give UTC an edge over General Electric in the engine business.
   Two of UTC's aerospace units - Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney - have been
the subject of merger and sell-off rumors, and early last year, David
wouldn't rule out putting Sikorsky up for sale. In August, the London
financial markets started their annual rumor of a merger between P&W and
rival Rolls-Royce.
   But selling is now out of the picture, and David says "it might even be
nice if we could make an acquisition, or two, or three," with the caveat
that any acquisition be a ready fit for UTC with no pruning.
   After a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, David tells AP
that he would consider acquisitions in either the engine or helicopter
market, and that so far the only obstacle has been a lack of candidates.
   He hints that one reason UTC is interested in buying on the propulsion
side is to boost Pratt & Whitney in its "neck-and-neck" competition with
General Electric.

INT'L JET ENGINE SUPPLY TO ACQUIRE STARTUP CARRIER
Merger With Air 21 Up For Shareholder Approval

   International Jet Engine Supply agreed to merge with startup carrier Air
21, effectively acquiring the Fresno, Calif.-based regional airline if the
carrier's shareholders okay the deal in a special meeting slated for
Friday.
   Under the agreement worked out last week, each share of Air 21 common
stock will be converted into one share of International Jet common stock,
and Air 21 will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of IJES.
   Air 21 just started a low-fare jet service to Fresno, Palm Springs, and
San Francisco, Calif., and Las Vegas.

ANOTHER ROLLS-ROYCE BULK ORDER FROM GULFSTREAM
Tay 611 Builds To Run Into Next Decade

   Gulfstream Aerospace handed G-IV business jet engine sole-source
Rolls-Royce another bulk engine order last month, taking production of the
Tay 611 small turbofan into the next century with a commitment worth more
than a quarter of a billion dollars.
   The new contract also answers industry speculation that with the
introduction of the new G-V business jet - powered by BMW Rolls-Royce's
BR710 turbofan - the G-IV and G-IV SP might begin to wind down.
   "Today's announcement reconfirms Gulfstream's plan to build the G-IV SP
and G-V concurrently," Rolls says in a prepared statement. The 13,850 lbst.
Tay 611 already powers 280 G-IV and G-IV SP business jets.

RUSSIAN COURT TAKES UP RYBINSK CHALLENGES NEXT WEEK
Future For GE's 'Strategic Partner' Should Resolve

   The two-year battle over whether and how to privatize Russia's once-
proud Rybinsk Motors - General Electric's strategic partner in the former
Soviet Union - looks set to end next week, when a Russian high court will
take up a lawsuit challenging the state's authority to put up stakes in the
company for public sale.
   The State Property Committee's Federal Bankruptcy Agency had hoped to
put 37% of the aircraft enginemaker on the block last week, but wound up
putting off the auction until mid-February because of another lawsuit
claiming that part of that stake had already been set aside for workers.
   But the second lawsuit, by AO Rybinskiye Motory itself against the
state, claims that the whole privatization is improper, a suit that will be
heard Jan. 15 by a Moscow high court.
   "I venture to suppose that the court will not decide this case in favor
of Rybinsk Motors," says Georgy Tal, the bankruptcy agency's first deputy
chief executive. "And after that the decision of the lower court will be
meaningless."
   That would clear the way for the auction to proceed, and for Rybinsk to
settle down to the business of recovery.
   Rybinsk makes engines for almost all Russia's military transports and
more than half of its civil aircraft, including the Ilyushin Il-76,
Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-154M, but output tumbled to six engines per
month in 1995 after averaging nearly 10 a month in 1994.
   Last fall GE worked out framework agreements with Rybinsk covering any
GE engine with potential Russian applications, and the goal - now delayed -
was to have solid agreements worked out by the end of 1995 covering at
least three engines in five applications: the CT7 turboprop on the Sukhoi
Su-80 and Kamov Ka-64, CFM International medium turbofans for re-engining
projects, and industrial turbine installations.

GENERAL ELECTRIC

   GENERAL ELECTRIC may wind up being rival Pratt & Whitney's biggest
cheerleader, at least for now. That's because as the first early ETOPS
engine in commercial service, the PW4084 is under the microscope as the
validation - or repudiation - of the whole idea of winning extended twin
operations clearance from entry into service. GE may not like P&W, but
until the GE90 gets its own early ETOPS approval, GE needs to ensure that
the concept gets all the support it needs.
   "They better pray nothing happens to [the P&W] engine," quips an FAA
official, noting that GE may not hear definitively about early ETOPS until
mid-1996.

IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS?

   IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS? Airbus Industrie delivered 106 aircraft
through November, a lot more than it booked in new orders. Some financial
analysts like to see that - it means inventory is being converted into cash
as the backlog slims down. But it also means that future deliveries, and
thus future cash flow, will be curtailed, and that could pose interesting
problems for aircraft enginemakers looking to new Airbus products for
market expansion.
   One industry veteran tells AP that the money problem couldn't come at a
worse time for the European consortium. "They have to solve" the problem of
the A330 and A340, he says, noting that if Boeing keeps its market lead
with the 777, a re-engining isn't enough to keep up with the 777's range
and payload. "The A330/A340 wing is maxed-out," he says. Regardless of
engine, "you won't go any faster, any farther."

IRAN MAY BE CLOSE

   IRAN MAY BE CLOSE to a deal to open an aircraft plant to build Russian
jetliners, some 17 years after the Islamic revolution closed the door to
flag carrier Iran Air renewing its fleet of Boeing-built jetliners.
Published reports in Iran claim that the Isphahan plant in central Iran
will start building Tu-114 transports within a year, and other planes are
reportedly also under study.
   Some of the Boeing planes won't wait for new production: Iran is also
reportedly near a deal to buy 12 Tupolev Tu-154 jetliners outright.

JAPAN'S NEW FIGHTER ENGINE

   JAPAN'S NEW FIGHTER ENGINE project will survive, despite postponement of
the fighter prototype the engine was supposed to power. Japan's government
agreed last week on a new five-year defense plan that scuttled the future
fighter program - slated to produce a demonstrator aircraft by the turn of
the century (AP, Sept. 29, 1994) - in favor of continuing work on the
program's 10,000 lbst.-class turbofan. Japan's Defense Agency hopes to use
Ishikawajima-Harima's 3,674 lbst. F3-30 turbofan, which now powers the
Kawasaki T-4 trainer, as the starting point for the new machine.
   JDA also cut back on its FS-X procurement, dropping 11 of the 141
originally planned U.S./Japan co-developed fighters under pressure from the
Finance Ministry.

AEROSPACE PROPULSION ORDERBOOK -- COMMERCIAL

   This update includes late 1995 orders, but final 1995 delivery figures
won't be available for several weeks. We will continue to update forward-
year figures for several weeks before removing 1994 inventory data from the
