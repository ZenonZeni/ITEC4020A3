<a name="What is MADD"><h3>What is MADD Canada?</h3>
MADD Canada is a national network of concerned citizens committed
to stopping the crime of impaired driving. Based on the success
of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in the United States, 
MADD Canada is working to heighten awareness about the dangers
of impaired driving, offer aid and counseling to its victims, 
and save lives.<p>

<a name="Problem"><h3>Is driving under the influence a big problem 
in Canada?</h3>
<b>Definitely.</b> The impaired driving problem is as bad as ever -
or worse. In fact, it's the single largest criminal cause of death 
in our country. To put it in perspective: in 1992, there were 732 
homicides in Canada. By contrast,  there are about 2,500 fatalities
resulting from impaired driving each year. The death rate from
impaired driving is thus <i>three to four times the national
murder rate.</i> It is a crime of epidemic proportions.<p>

<a name="Crime"><h3>Is impaired driving a crime?</h3>
<b>Yes.</b> And if you have any doubts about the seriousness
of this criminal act, think about this: a first-time impaired 
driving offense is punishable in Canada by up to five years
in prison. If the impaired driver is found guilty of causing
bodily harm or death, he can be punished by serving ten
or more years behind bars. But for every impaired driver
who is arrested and charged, there are countless more
who get away with their crime.<p>

<a name="What"><h3>What is MADD Canada doing about drinking and 
driving?</h3>
MADD Canada is working to prevent impaired driving and help its
victims through:
<ul>
<li><b>Legislative Initiatives.</b> Tougher laws do discourage those
who might drink and drive; and fewer impaired drivers on the
road translates to fewer crashes and more saved lives.
<li><b>Teenage Outreach.</b> Young people are still involved in a 
tragically high number of impaired driving crashes. MADD Canada
is working to reduce this toll by educating our young people
and spreading the message about the dangers of impaired
driving.
<li><b>Public Awareness Campaigns.</b> Many people do not understand 
how dangerous it is to drink and drive. They also may not realize
how much they can do to help eliminate the problem. We're helping
more people understand that even one drink can impair a person's
ability to driver safely.
<li><b>Victim Assistance Programs.</b> MADD Canada offers support to
victims and their families during the grieving and healing process.
We also help them understand how the justice system works and 
what their rights are.
</ul><p>

<a name="Specific"><h3>What specific legislation doex MADD Canada
support that would help eliminate the impaired driving problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>National Minimum Legal Drinking Age.</b> Achieving a national
minimum drinking age of 21 in canada is one of our first
reform goals. Underage impaired driving deaths dropped 
over 40% in the U.S. when the drinking age was raised to
21. When this minimum drinking age legislation is 
implemented, it will begin saving lives almost immediately.
<li><b>Administrative Licence Suspension (ALS).</b> This measure gives
police officers the authority to confiscate and impaired driver's
licencd at the time of arrest, thereby preventing him from
committing more impaired driving crimes before his case is
heatd in court. ALS will reduce this threat on our highways.
<li><b>The Graduated Driver's Licence System.</b> Under consideration
in several provinces, this process allows new drivers to eatn
their licences gradually, as they prove that they have the
skills and maturity to  be responsible drivers.
</ul>
Call or write to your provincial and federal legislators. Tell them
that you support tougher laws to stop deaths and injuries
resulting from impaired driving.<p>

<a name="Young people"><h3>What is MADD Canada doing to prevent
young people from drinking and driving?</h3>
MADD Canada goes where teenagers are-the schools. Our
"Close to Home" presentation, teaches high school students
about the dangers of driving while impaired by alcohol and
other drugs. "Close to Home" hers MADD Canada's message
across in a multi-media format that combines video and rock
music with victim presenters who till their stories.<p>


<a name="Response"><h3>Are people responding to MADD Canada's
public awareness campaign?</h3>
Yes, through these and other programs:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Red Ribbon</b> gives a different, safer meaning to the phrase
"tie one on." Supporters display the ribbons on car antennas,
mirrors, and door handles. Originally intended as a reminder
to drive safe and sober during the holiday season, red ribbons
are now displayed throughout the year.
<li><b>Candlelight Vigils</b> bring together victims of impaired driving
crashes to share their grief and comfort each other. The
Candlelight Vigils are also a visible reminder to everyone
that drimking and driving must stop. Many MADD Canada
chapters hold such candlelight vigils each December.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Victims"><h3>I know that some victims of impaired driving
crashes suffer terrible emotional trauma. What is MADD Canada doing
to help them?</h3>
A big part of MADD Canada's mission is to help and
support victins of impaired driving crimes. We help
victims and their families in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li><b>Support Services:</b> MADD Canada provides telephone
support and information to assist victims.
<li><b>Understanding the Legal System:</b> We provide information
about the judicial process and clarify victims'
rights. MADD Canada chapter members accompany
victims to court and follow up with them on the
sentencing of the offender.
<li><b>Victim Impact Statements:</b> Prepared by victims or their
surviving family members with the help of MADDD
Canada, these statements explain how the crime of 
impaired driving has shattered their lives. Victim
Impact Statements can lead to tougher sentencing
of offenders.<p>
</ul>

<img align=right src=images/between.gif>

<a name="Risk"><h3>I don't drink and drive. Am I still at risk</h3>
<b>Yes.</b> Impaired drivers can strike anyone at any time, like a stray
bullet hurtling along our nation's roadways. As long as there are
impaired drivers on our roads, no one is ever completely safe
from this crime.<p>

<a name="Help"><h3>Is there anything I can do to help?</h3>
<b>Yes.</b> There are several ways you can support MADD Canada's
fight against drinking and driving:
<ul>
<li>Support tougher legislation for impaired driving offenders.
<li>Don't serve alcohol to minors.
<li>Volunteer to help your local MADD Canada chapter.
<li>And please - <i>never</i> drink and drive.<p>
</ul>
