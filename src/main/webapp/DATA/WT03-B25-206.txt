Joint Research Announcement</CENTER>

</H2>

<HR><BR>

The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) will publish a Joint

Research Announcement (JRA) with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

(NASA) for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) scheduled for

launch in 1997. The purpose of this JRA is to solicit a wide range of researcher

and group participation. We hope to promote creative and constructive research

using remote sensing technology to understand energy and water cycles on

Earth. <BR>

<P><B>1. TRMM Outline<BR>

<BR>

</B>TRMM is the first artificial satellite to observe precipitation from

space. The objectives of TRMM are to understand the global energy and water

cycles by providing quantitative measurement of rainfall in the tropics

and by determining how that rainfall may effect global circulation, to predict

global climate change, and to predict weather anomalies and natural disasters.

The sensors on board TRMM are the Precipitation Radar (PR), TRMM Microwave

Imager (TMI), Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant

Energy System (CERES), and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS)<BR>

<BR>

</B>This opportunity is intended to support science investigations for three

years beginning shortly before the TRMM launch. The detailed information

including technical description and proposal instruction is contained in

the JRA which will be available and accessible in the NASDA EORC internet

web site after August 7, 1996. The address of the site is:

For proposers who do not have internet access, we will send a hard copy

upon request. Please contact the JRA Office person shown below.<BR>

<BR>

Proposals will be evaluated through scientific peer review and engineering

feasibility reviews. Selection is expected to be announced during February

1997.<BR>

<BR>

<B>3. Letter of Intent<BR>

<BR>

</B>In order for us to prepare the review process, proposers are requested

to submit a &quot;letter of intent&quot; to the JRA office by September

4,1996. Please include in the letter, (1) the name and address of the Principal

Investigator, (2) the project title, (3) a concise outline or abstract of

the project.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4. Proposal Deadline<BR>

<BR>

</B>The proposal must reach us by October 22, 1996.<BR>
