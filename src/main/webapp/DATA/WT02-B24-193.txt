<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Deidre>Deidre Hall's Story; a made for TV
Movie</A><BR>Deidre Hall's Story: After All</CENTER>
</H3><P><CENTER>(ABC November 12, 9pm)</CENTER>
<P>
<P>Los Angeles -<B>"We're going to have a baby!"</B> &#160;It seems that
each of the hundreds of couples who have asked the Center for help in creating
their family has chosen a different way to tell the good news to friends
and family. Some have written letters, others get on the phone, some even
throw a big party! Deidre Hall, star of Days of our Lives, and husband Steve
Sohmer, decided to tell the world their story first with a cover story in
People Magazine and now, a made for TV movie.
<P>Airing November 12 on the ABC television network, Deidre Hall's Story:
After All (starring, of course, Deidre Hall), details the 20 years of Deidre
trying to have a baby. Like all couples experiencing infertility, Deidre
and Steve endured numerous visits to the infertility specialist, failed IVF
attempts, and experienced their hopes and dreams dash away month after month.
The movie also takes us on their journey to the Center for Surrogate Parenting
and their meeting with Robin, the surrogate who completed their family with
2 beautiful children. Deidre and Steve decided to go public and produce their
surrogacy story because as Deidre says, "Women are spoon fed a lot of
misinformation and they are terrorized by stories of failed adoptions and
failed surrogacies. The Baby M story, a nasty battle involving the surrogate
mother, was a nightmare. I'm not trying to teach people how to be involved
in surrogacy. I'm trying to say there is a successful way to do this. There's
more to this than people realize. It's an exquisite trust; it's a profound
sharing."
<P>While Deidre Hall's Story: After All is not a documentary, it does a
surprisingly good job at realistically describing the process and the emotions
involved in surrogacy. A particularly gratifying aspect of Deidre Hall's
Story: After All, for the staff at the Center is the recognition paid to
the professionals involved in Surrogate Parenting.
<P>We thank Deidre, Steve and their two lovely boys, David Atticus and Tully.
We also thank Robin, the surrogate, for allowing us to share in part of their
lives. A successful surrogacy arrangement is always cause for joyous celebration.

<P>We have spent the last month surfing the Internet looking for information
on surrogacy and egg donation. There have been a few sites where we have
found some information, but no main source of information or access to
professional opinions. So, we have decided to begin creating and developing
our own site on the World Wide Web, which will offer information and updates
on surrogacy and egg donation. From our Home Page, Net users will be able
to link to other sites or receive information on a large range of topics.
Some topics to be covered are: general information on surrogacy and egg donation;
myths and realities of surrogacy and egg donation; psychological aspects
of third party reproduction; updated success rates; names of infertility
doctors; names of sperm banks for semen analysis and workups; social disease
testing recommended; legal issues; legislative updates, and Frequently Asked
Questions.
<P>We envision that the Center will facilitate an evening of Internet Relay
Chat (a "party line" real-time conversations on the Net), with a guest host.
These guests will include: psychologists and psychotherapists specializing
in the field of surrogacy and egg donation, infertility doctors, lawyers,
social workers, couples at different stages in the surrogacy process, and
surrogate mothers sharing their stories. We feel that an occasional open
discussion will be beneficial.
<P>We welcome any ideas, suggestions, comments and help in establishing our
WWW Home Page. Please e-mail the Center at:

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Bedrest>The Surrogate and Bedrest</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>by <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Carol">Carol Wolfe</A>,
M.F.C.C.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The vast majority of surrogate mothers have had smooth and easy pregnancies.
When a surrogate has a difficult and complicated pregnancy she requires bedrest.
She is often surprised and finds herself with some difficult coping and stress
management ahead. The surrogate knows that people in her life are watching
to see if she will fall apart at the birth. She often will feel that she
has to present a picture that "everything is OK...no problem!". Surrogates
are usually "givers", meaning that they volunteer for everything and are
usually bad at receiving. It can be very difficult for them to recognize
their own needs, much less ask for help.
<P>One of the most challenging aspects of bedrest is that the surrogate may
be able to take care of the needs of her own children. She may be unable
to do the thousand things a mom does to keep the family running, such as
meals, getting kids up for school, music lessons, Girl Scouts, etc. A pregnancy
in the third trimester can be difficult with its limitations anyway, but
bedrest will amplify those difficulties a hundredfold. The surrogate is disabled
and uncomfortable. She may be on monitors and medications, and wants to be
sure that her responsibility to the baby is taken care of. Additionally,
she may be feeling very guilty that her family has to sacrifice so much.
<P>The second most challenging part of the pregnancy and bedrest, is the
strain on her marriage. It is inevitable that her husband is going to have
to cover some of these duties. He is supportive of her desire to do this,
but husbands have varying degrees of desire to participate at all. He may
begin to be grumpy and disgruntled over his added responsibility and will
rarely let the couple see this. It is not that he is unhappy about the overall
goal of helping to create a family, but that he is concerned about the
difficulties that may be endured by his own family.
<P>Sometimes a difficult pregnancy can involve anything from the scare of
miscarriage with a few weeks of bedrest, to weeks of hospitalization. Financial
compensation a surrogate receives is not emotionally comforting when a surrogate
is completely disabled. A couple should be very careful not to have the attitude
that "she is getting paid for this anyway". This attitude can be extremely
damaging to the relationship. The surrogate/prospective parents relationship
is benefited by each party trying to understand what the other may be
experiencing. Those who are able to understand and empathize usually report
a more successful experience.

<H3><CENTER><B><A NAME=Seminars>International Seminars</A></B></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>As the Center's reputation grows internationally, we continue to bring
our message of positive surrogacy to couples on virtually every continent.
Over the next few months, we will be hosting seminars in Taiwan, Australia
and Israel. Our first international seminar took place in Israel in 1991
where we discovered couples were very eager to get our information and meet
the Center's staff, without having to spend the time and money to fly to
Beverly Hills. Since a meeting at the Center is almost always mandatory prior
to joining our programs, these international seminars provide all of us with
great opportunity; the couples have their consultation in their place of
residence, and the staff at the Center enjoys great sightseeing!
<P>Incidentally, we now consider next year's seminars in New York, Chicago
and Dallas as just a trip around the corner.

</H3><P>
<P>Greetings from Cloud 9!
<P>Enclosed are a few photographs of Brianna (born Dec. 14, 1994 by Polly,
surrogate mother) and some of the people who helped to make her possible.
We hope that the last earthquake has not created for you as big a "shake
up" in your lives as Brianna has for us! We don't regret a sleepless minute.
Actually, she has been very understanding of us, and has tolerated almost
all of our foibles and lack of comprehension of the lectures she gives us
each day. She is very good-natured and seems to love people (she certainly
gets passed around like a football). We credit part of this apparent adaptability
to the first few weeks of her life in which she traveled 1/3 the length of
California a couple of days after she was born, flew to Kansas and back at
5 days old, and then few to Canada a couple of weeks later. Then there have
been several parties in her honor to attend, etc. etc. Quite the social schedule
for one so young.
<P>We thought you might like the photographs enclosed. To be sure, you will
receive others. Proud? Who, us?
<P>Thank you again for helping to facilitate the most wonderful experience
of our lives!
<P>With our best wishes,
<P>Bruce, Betty and Brianna

<UL><LI>THE CENTER OFFERS AN "OPEN" EGG DONATION PROGRAM WITH A REGISTRY
OF OVER 150 AVAILABLE DONORS.<BR>
<DL><DT>"Open" refers to the range of communication between the Intended
Parents and their egg donor. Some couples elect to meet their egg donor and
be open about their full identity, while others may wish to divulge only
a limited amount of information. Each couple must select their own comfort
level. At a minimum, couples will receive a photograph of their donor and
her children, as well as her full application form. The application covers
questions of ethnic background, education, family genetics and medical
history.<BR>
</DL></UL><UL><LI>A DONOR MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE GENETIC CHILD OF HER OWN.<BR>
<DL><DT>This proves her fertility. She has carried a pregnancy and become
a parent; she has also experienced "bonding".<BR>
</DL></UL><UL><LI>DONORS SHOULD NOT DONATE MORE THAN THREE TIMES, PREFERABLY
ONLY TWICE. <BR>
<DL><DT>We must be concerned about the genetic history of your child. Since
egg donation is a fairly new field, we do not know the full medical side-effects
of stimulating the ovaries. We also do not know the effects of a child knowing
he/she has many half-siblings with several different families.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Clock>Egg Donation: Reversing the Biological
Clock</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>by <A HREF=Gordbio.html>Elaine Gordon</A>, Ph.D.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center is proud to announce its <A HREF=EggD.html>comprehensive egg
donation program</A> utilizing the team approach. Donors are thoroughly screened
both medically and psychologically in an effort to assess whether they meet
the stringent guidelines established by the professional staff. There is
new hope for women who have previously been unable to conceive due to premature
ovarian failure, age, or genetic considerations. The success rate using donor
eggs is far greater for these women than In Vitro Fertilization, where they
use their own eggs. Although the odds are significantly better, they
unfortunately are not 100%.
<P>Recipients are interviewed and counseled regarding the medical and
psychosocial implications of the process. Introductions and matches are made
by consent of both parties. Egg donation is said to be a new reproductive
cure which enables patients to achieve their dream, to bear and nurture a
child. Egg donation provides a means for the medical community to turn back
the biological clock of women nearing the end their reproductive years.
<P>The old tradition of donation is based on anonymity, secrecy, and
nondisclosure. However, there is one question that emerges as the foremost
in recipients minds when they begin to contemplate egg donation: The issue
of anonymous verses non-anonymous donation. Tradition and experience have
led us to question the wisdom of old policies and consequently resulted in
developing a program that offers the opportunity for non-anonymity. We realize
it is very easy to keep egg donation a secret and we also know there are
no easy answers to this very difficult dilemma.
<P>Whether one turns to egg donation or not depends on the medical diagnosis.
In consultation with your physician, the decision should be made whether
you are an appropriate candidate for egg donation. If you are, you must also
decide whether you are psychologically prepared to be a candidate. This means
being ready to make a commitment to parenting a child that is genetically
related to only one of you. It also involves asking yourself and your partner
some hard questions which deserve some very honest answers. These questions
will be extremely difficult ones. Who to tell or not tell; when to tell;
the non-genetic relationship disclosure issues, and what to tell the child,
are all important questions that need to be discussed.
<P>If you have any questions concerning the egg donation program, please
feel free to <A HREF=Contact.html>call our office </A>for more information.
We look forward to working with those patients who find egg donation to be
their option and making their experience a rewarding one.

<P>These statistics reflect all couples who participated both traditional
surrogacy (artificial insemination) an gestational surrogacy (in vitro
fertilization). There were over 900 transfers and inseminations studied.
<P>Of 412 gestational surrogacy embryo transfers, the overall full-term pregnancy

<H4>Birth Certificate reflects the Genetic Parents in Gestational Surrogacy
</H4><P><A HREF=Attybio.html>John K. Ciccarelli</A>, Esq. advises that Paternity
and Maternity Judgments remain the method of choice for finalizing the parental
rights in gestational surrogacy in California. Mr. Ciccarelli explains that
by his appearance in court prior to the birth of the baby, he is able to
obtain an order from a judge directing the hospital and physicians to complete
the birth certificate by listing the couple's names as the mother and father.
Therefore, there Is no need for an adoption to take place. While Mr. Ciccarelli
employed this method prior to the California decision in Johnson vs. Calvert,
there is no doubt that the Court's ruling in that case provided the lower
courts with additional guidance to this procedure. This method has been
successfully used in more than 126 IVF births. To date, no California court
has refused to recognize the couple's parental rights.
<P>
<H4>Folic Acid &amp; Pregnancy: &#160;A New Discovery
</H4><P><B>Folic Acid</B> is important prior to and during the early stages
of pregnancy. It helps to protect the unborn baby against birth defects of
the spine and brain, like spina bifida or "open spine". Once a potential
surrogate mother is medically cleared and accepted into our program, she
intakes 0.4 mg of <B>Folic Acid</B> every day for approximately 4 months
prior to pregnancy. <B>Folic Acid</B> is a B vitamin and is found mainly
in green leafy vegetables, beans, asparagus, citrus fruits/juice, whole grain
foods and liver. For additional information, call The March of Dimes,
1-800-367-6630.
