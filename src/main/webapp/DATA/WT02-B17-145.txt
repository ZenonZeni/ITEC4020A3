<H3>Stakeholder Meetings</H3>

<P>
In early 1995, DOE Hydrogen Program members held a series of discussions 
with 
senior executives from the industrial, transportation, and utility 
sectors of the economy.  These discussions focused on markets, technology 
development, and regulatory issues. 
<P>
An Industry Outreach Workshop was held in June 1995 to continue the 
dialogue with 
industry decision makers that began in a series of meetings earlier in 
the year.  Workshop 
attendees discussed preliminary findings, greater industry participation 
in the program, and 
obtaining input from industry on key issues.  Three groups were formed to 
discuss the transition of program work from research to 
commercialization; the roles of government and industry; and 
communication mechanisms.
<P>
We learned that industry is interested in participating with DOE in field 
validations of 
component technologies and subsystems in areas where industry and DOE 
interests are 
compatible.  However, intellectual property rights and competitiveness 
issues remain significant obstacles to industry participation.  Effective 
two-way communication was stressed.  Current communication mechanisms 
were viewed favorably, and some suggestions were made on how to expand 
them and how to establish new ones.
