<P>

Some 45 UC faculty and graduate students interested in comparative

migration issues held a workshop October 4, 1996 at UCD.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335440"><FONT SIZE=5>Immigration and Welfare

Reform</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H1>


<P>

Susan Martin, Executive Director of the Commission on Immigration

Reform, discussed the origins, provisions, and likely consequences

of three major three major laws that had their origins in the

1994 and 1995 recommendations of the Commission on Immigration

Reform: the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed

into law on April 24, 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work

Opportunity Reconciliation Act, signed into law on August 22,

1996, and the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility

Act, signed into law on September 30, 1996.<BR>


<P>

There is never a &quot;good time&quot; to make immigration policy,

and 1996 was particularly difficult because of the need to find

savings in government expenditures, and American insecurity and

frustration.<BR>


<P>

The CIR's recommendations were based on two principles. First,

the US should do more to reduce illegal immigration. To accomplish

this goal, CIR recommended that the borders be &quot;managed&quot;

to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants, increasing penalties

for smuggling, and testing systems to help employers determine

quickly and reliably who is legally authorized to work in the

US. <BR>


<P>

Second, the CIR recommended that the US strike a &quot;grand bargain&quot;

on legal immigration--reduce the growth of immigration, but maintain

legal immigrants' full access to the social safety net. Specifically,

CIR recommended that the US speed up the admission of immediate

family members of immigrants living in the US, but eliminate the

right of brothers and sisters of US citizens to immigrate.<BR>


<P>

Congress adopted many of the CIR's recommendations to reduce illegal

immigration, but rejected the CIR's grand bargain proposal.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335441"><FONT SIZE=5>Illegal Immigration</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The CIR urged a three prong effort to reduce and deter illegal

immigration: prevent entry over borders, prevent those inside

the US from getting jobs or benefits and, if detected, quickly

remove illegal aliens from the US.<BR>


<P>

Congress agreed to add Border Patrol agents and support personnel

to deter illegal entries over US borders, and also agreed to add

staff to expedite legal entries. However, Congress did not add

significantly to efforts to prevent illegal aliens in the US from

getting jobs: US employers may, but do not have to, participate

in experimental employee verification systems. The INS will get

1200 more inspectors, including 900 whose primary responsibility

is to deal with employer sanctions and alien smuggling.<BR>


<P>

However, at the last minute, Congress refused to authorize the

hiring of 350 more labor inspectors to the DOL.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335442"><FONT SIZE=5>Removing Aliens</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The anti-terrorism bill made it easier to remove from the US aliens

who are convicted of felonies in the US. Once apprehended, criminal

aliens must be detained, and they have fewer opportunities to

appeal to stay in the US and, under the new immigration law, they

may be required to serve their sentences in their country of origin,

if the US negotiates agreements with other countries.<BR>


<P>

The immigration bill also made it easier to exclude foreigners

who enter the US without valid documents. If an unauthorized alien

applies for asylum to remain in the US, she must make a credible

claim to an INS asylum officer. If the INS officer rejects her

claim as not credible, then she has one appeal to an immigration

judge, who must make a decision within 7 days. <BR>


<P>

Unauthorized aliens in the US for seven or more years may apply

for &quot;suspension of deportation,&quot; an acknowledgment that,

over that time, the alien may have developed US roots. However,

Congress adopted a tougher standard for suspension of deportation,

and limited the number of foreigners who can obtain this relief

to 4000 per year.<BR>


<P>

The new immigration law allows the US Attorney General to deport

without any judicial review any illegal alien apprehended inside

the US, who has been in the US for less than two years. 

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335443"><FONT SIZE=5>Legal Immigration</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

According to Susan Martin, the US legal immigration system, which

manages immigration by backlogs or waiting lists, needs a major

overhaul. Over 1.1 million spouses and children of legal immigrants

living in the US are waiting--up to 10 years--to come to the US.

Many do not wait; they come illegally. Similarly, there are 1.7

million siblings, such as the adult brothers and sisters of US

citizens, in the Philippines, Mexico, and other countries waiting,

sometimes 20 to 30 years, until they receive permission to migrate

legally to the US.<BR>


<P>

The CIR recommended that the US eliminate immigration slots for

brothers and sisters of US citizens. However, an unusual alliance

between business and religious and ethnic groups prevented changes

to the legal immigration system, but not changes to the US welfare

system that make most legal immigrants ineligible for benefits.

<BR>


<P>

The CIR recommended that the US draw a firm line between the access

of legal and illegal immigrants to welfare and other public assistance

in the US. The CIR recommended that illegal immigrants receive

only emergency services, and those authorized by the US constitution,

including K-12 education for illegal alien children. <BR>


<P>

The CIR recommended that legal immigrants be eligible for the

same public assistance services as US citizens, but that sponsorship

agreements be made legally binding--if a US citizen or legal immigrant

agreed to support a relative, and that relative, after arriving

in the US, applied for welfare, the applicant would be assumed

to have access to the income and assets of the sponsor, and thus

likely not be eligible for benefits. <BR>


<P>

In order to sponsor the admission of an immigrant, a US resident

would have to earn at least 125 percent of the poverty line for

the sponsor and the immigrant(s) who would arrive, and sign an

affidavit promising to support the immigrant in the US. The US-sponsor

could have another US-cosponsor.<BR>


<P>

The welfare law makes newly-arrived legal immigrants not eligible

for most welfare benefits for at least five years after their

arrival in the US. 

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335444"><FONT SIZE=5>What's Next?</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Susan Martin believes that immigration, which accounts for about

40 percent of US population growth, will continue to be a prominent

issue in the US and California. Four issues not addressed in 1996

are likely to get attention: legal immigration, refugees, immigrant

policy, and the administration of US immigration.<BR>


<P>

Martin believes that the US will eventually have to strike some

type of Grand Bargain of the sort recommended by the CIR because.

With legal immigration rising, and welfare services ending, poor

immigrants may become more vulnerable and visible. <BR>


<P>

Second, the end of the cold war has eliminated the major rationale

for refugee admissions over the past 50 years--providing a haven

for those fleeing communism.

<P>

The US must rethink what it wants to accomplish with refugee policy--just

who among the world's 25 million refugees should US admit to start

over in the US?<BR>


<P>

Third, the US has admitted about 15 million immigrants since 1980,

and many of them are not faring well in the US economy. As immigrants

and US citizens compete in a labor market crowded by ex-welfare

recipients, the US may have to consider immigrant integration

policies.<BR>


<P>

Fourth, the INS is one of the few federal agencies whose budget

has doubled in a time of reduced government spending. The US needs

to study what has become a large and expensive system for managing

immigration.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335445"><FONT SIZE=5>California Implications</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Phil Romero explained why Governor Wilson in the early 1990s led

a campaign to reduce illegal immigration. The 1991-92 recession

increased the demand for state-funded services, but made it impossible

to pay for more state services. However, immigration continued

to bring large numbers of people into the state who needed state-funded

services, including unauthorized aliens.<BR>


<P>

According to Romero, Wilson thought that the federal government

should either reimburse CA for the cost of providing services

to illegal aliens, or prevent their entry. When the federal government

did neither, Wilson endorsed a state effort to reduce services

to unauthorized aliens, Proposition 187. <BR>


<P>

David Illig explained that the major assistance programs affected

by 1996 immigration and welfare legislation include AFDC, which

had about 380,000 legal immigrants on the rolls in summer 1996,

Food Stamps, with about 436,000 non-US citizen recipients, SSI,

with 331,000 immigrant recipients, and in-home supportive services,

with 55,000 non-US citizen recipients. Perhaps 500,000 non-US

citizens now receiving one or more welfare benefits may lose them

under 1996 legislation.<BR>


<P>

The major fear in CA is that, as non-US citizens are removed from

welfare rolls, state and local government may have to provide

assistance to them. Under CA law, county governments must provide

locally-paid-for General Assistance to persons not eligible for

any other benefits who need assistance, and in July 1996, about

150,000 persons in CA were receiving assistance that cost county

governments $300 to $400 million per year.<BR>


<P>

CA politicians are waiting until after the November 1996 elections

to decide how to respond to the non-eligibility of most newly-arrived

immigrants for welfare benefits, and the removal of immigrants

from the welfare rolls. Among the options are to prolong the eligibility

of current immigrant recipients--non-US citizens currently receiving

Food Stamps can continue to do so until April 1, 1996, encourage

naturalization, or simply ignore federal sanctions that are threatened

if CA does not remove immigrants as the law requires. <BR>


<P>

One proposal is to have parallel welfare programs in CA--a 100

percent federally-funded program that meets all federal criteria,

and a 100-percent state-funded program that would permit e.g.

people to draw benefits longer than five years, and perhaps serve

some immigrants.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335446"><FONT SIZE=5>Los Angeles and San Diego</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Roger Waldinger, UCLA, discussed the conclusions to his book,

Ethnic Los Angeles. Waldinger noted that, in 1990, about 33 percent

of LA county residents, and 37 percent of LA city residents, were

foreign born, comparable to the foreign born share of the population

of New York City in 1910. <BR>


<P>

However, while New York City has experienced immigration continuously

for two centuries, Los Angeles experienced mass immigration only

since 1980. Today, 55 percent of the immigrants in the US live

in five cities, including 20 percent in Los Angeles, and 18 percent

in New York City.<BR>


<P>

In Los Angeles, Mexicans are the dominant immigrant group, and

most of them have very little education--over half of the adult

Mexican immigrants in 1990 in Los Angeles had less than eight

years of education. <BR>


<P>

Waldinger believes that social networks and economic development

evolved in ways so that the supply of unskilled immigrants created

a demand for them in &quot;niches,&quot; industries and occupations

in which an immigrant group is over represented, compared to its

share of the work force, by 50 percent or more. One of the most

striking findings of this niche analysis is that Mexican immigrants

are over-represented in low wage industries such as non-durables

manufacturing, and in occupations such as gardening, while African-Americans

are over represented in government jobs.<BR>


<P>

Commentator Dan Walters, Sacramento Bee, stressed the difference

in the characteristics of the population of CA--about 53 percent

of state residents are non-Hispanic whites--and voters in CA--about

80 percent of the voters are non-Hispanic whites. White voters

are older than the average residents, setting up potential ethnic

and age political conflicts that, Walters believes, will continue

to be resolved in favor of the older whites. <BR>


<P>

Some institutions are trying anticipate and plan for these demo-political

changes. Only 20 percent of CA voters still have children in K-12

public schools, which may have contributed to Prop 98, which guarantees

state funding for K-12 schools.<BR>


<P>

Finally, Walters argued that the 1996 naturalization wave has

not yet shown up on voter rolls. There are 19 to 20 million eligible

voters in CA, 14 million registered voters, and 9 million votes

cast in November 1994--Hispanics cast 8 to 9 percent, or 800,000

of these votes.<BR>


<P>

Wayne Cornelius, UCSD, reported on a comparative study of employers

and workers in San Diego and Japan that is examining whether foreign

worker employment fluctuates over the business cycle. Preliminary

analysis suggests that, employers dependent on foreign workers

do not lay off immigrant workers and hire natives when natives

are presumably more available.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335447"><FONT SIZE=5>Los Angeles and Amsterdam</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Ivan Light, UCLA, summarized his contribution to a book that compares

immigration's effects on the garment industry in Los Angeles and

Amsterdam. In contrast to Saskia Sassen, who argues that globalization

creates a demand for immigrant workers by increasing the incomes

of the very rich who demand immigrant services from gardening

to maids, Light stresses that social networks enable immigrants

to cross borders and find jobs by lowering the cost and risk of

migrating. <BR>


<P>

Combining globalization and network theories yields a &quot;spillover&quot;

or threshold date, when migration switches from being mostly a

demand-pull to mostly a supply-push phenomenon. <BR>


<P>

Light notes that, in the LA garment industry, jobs are being created

by immigrants for immigrants. <BR>


<P>

Joshua Skov, UCB, noted that the globalization theory seems to

concentrate on structural explanations for migration, while networks

emphasize agency factors.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335448"><FONT SIZE=5>Mexico&iacute;s Labor

Market</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H1>


<P>

Agustin Escobar, <FONT COLOR=#000000>Ciesas Occidente, Guadalajara,

reviewed the evolution of Mexico's labor market since the 1980s,

and emphasized that the number of 16-64 year olds, many of whom

would be expected to join the labor force, increased much faster

than the number of jobs, both formal and informal. However, the

informal sector has lost some of its ability to serve as Mexico's

shock absorber after 1989, so that, as the mobility of Mexicans

increased, more Mexicans moved to border cities within Mexico,

and from Mexico to the US.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>Inequality increased in Mexico throughout

the past decade; the highest 10 percent of Mexican income earners

got 47 percent of Mexico's total income in 1992, and 48 percent

in 1994.</FONT>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335449"><FONT SIZE=5>Bi-National US-Mexican

Migration Study</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H1>


<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>The </FONT>Bi-National US-Mexican Migration

Study was proposed by Mexico to quantify migration between Mexico

and the US, and the US and Mexico, as well as the characteristics

of migrants, factors that sustain migration, the impacts of migration

in both countries, and policy responses. The study will be completed

in summer 1997.<BR>


<P>

There were 4.5 million Mexican-born persons in the US in 1990,

according to the Census, and 6.7 million in March 1996, according

to the CPS. Mexicans in the US have traditionally come from the

lower ends of the Mexican education and skill ladder, in part

because Bracero farm workers were recruited. Migration seems to

be less selective today than in the past; there are more urban

residents, more migrants with skills, and from new regions of

Mexico.<BR>


<P>

Demand-pull, supply-push, and network factors sustain Mexico-US

labor migration, but their roles have changed. Demand-pull factors

have declined in importance, and supply-push and network factors

have increased in importance.<BR>


<P>

As Mexico-US migration has increased in magnitude, changed in

character, and sustained by factors other than US-government approved

recruitment, the context of US-Mexican relations, as well as the

context for dealing with migration, has changed. <BR>
