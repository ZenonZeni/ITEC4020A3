<P>
Dollar-cost averaging is widely used by some
investors who don't have a lump sum to invest, but want to begin
an investment program. The plan also helps investors who do have
a lump sum to invest, but are afraid to enter the market for fear
of a correction. By using dollar-cost averaging, investors can
ease their way into the market and take advantage of any price
weakness to lower their average purchase cost. Since the success of
the plan depends on fixed periodic investments, investors should
consider their financial ability and willingness to continue purchasing
through periods of declining markets.
<P>
Dollar-cost averaging is a systematic investing
plan that involves buying equal dollar amounts of investments
at set intervals,  i.e., monthly, quarterly, etc. The table below
shows a hypothetical investment of $400 every quarter for one
year. Although the amount stays the same, the share price fluctuates
between $10 and $25 over the course of a year. When the price
of the shares is $10, the $400 investment buys 40 shares; when
the price is $25, the investment of $400 buys 16 shares.

<P>
By using this investment plan with fixed periodic
payments, you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer
shares when they are higher. Over time, the plan typically results
in an average share cost that is lower than the average share
price over the same time period. Strategically, the plan forces
investors to be in the market when prices are depressed, but also
when prices are high. Although dollar-cost averaging does not assure
an investor a profit or protect against a loss in a declining
market, it does help to eliminate emotions when investing in the
market.
