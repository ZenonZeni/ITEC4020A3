<h2>The 3 keys to reducing &quot;junk&quot; email. </h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Accurate Subject headings.</b> </li>
    <li><b>If you send it to the whole list, make sure it applies
        to the whole list.</b> </li>
    <li><b>Be substantial, ask yourself am I contributing to the
        list or detracting?</b> </li>
</ol>

<h3>Subject Lines: </h3>

<p> One way to make it easier to get to the meaty information you
want is to have *accurate* subject lines. If the subject line of
your post says Re: Proposed Strategies and you are talking about
something completely different, or are branching off from this
discussion create a new subject heading. Example: </p>

<p> Instead of just Re: Proposed Strategies which doesn't really
tell anyone what the content of the message is about. Try... </p>

<p> Discussion of CD Tactics (was Re: Proposed Strategies) </p>

<p> This is very helpful, in discovering and only reading the
posts you want to read. </p>

<h3>Personal Posts: </h3>

<p> Short, one or two line posts that only make a personal
statement torwards one or two people should be done in private.
The main goal is to respect other members of the group enough so
as to not post something that they are just going to have delete.
</p>

<p> There are two ways to avoid problems with being personal. </p>

<ol>
    <li>If all you really want to do is make a short 1 or 2 line
        personal rseponse to someone don't send it to the entire
        list just send it to that person. </li>
    <li>If you are making personal comments make sure that there
        is also something substantial that is pertinent to
        everyone included in the post. </li>
</ol>

<p> Basically if it doesn't have something that applies to the
whole list, don't post it to the whole list. </p>

<p> Please don't hestiate to be controversial or disagree with
others, this is called freedom of speech and its why a revolution
was waged, but do NOT use drctalk-l for excessive personal
banter. If it has substance </p>

<p> with a little banter, I don't think we have a problem.
Meaning that you can say nice &quot;Amens!&quot; and &quot;Way to
go!&quot; **IF** you also include something a little bit more
meaningful. If there is no substance and a lot of banter you
probably shouldn't have sent it to the whole list. This includes
the 1 or 2 line personal notes. </p>

<p> If we still have a problem with &quot;junk&quot; posts and
the traffic volume is still too high there are more stringent
measures that can be imposed. <br>
