<H3>Corporate Citizenship and the Saskatchewan Uranium Industry. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/michbio.html">Bernard M. Michel</A>.</H3>




<P>
The uranium mines of Saskatchewan, which contributed almost 30% to total world production in 1994, are
 an interesting laboratory for the study of corporate community relations, for five reasons: firstly there are
 only two operators, Cameco Corporation and COGEMA Resources Inc., to be considered; secondly, because
 of the boards of enquiry to review the Cluff Lake and Key Lake projects in the late 1970s and early 1980s
 there exist over 15 years worth of information on the public views of the industry; thirdly there exist records
 of continuous government monitoring of the industry; fourthly, Saskatchewan hosts two extraordinary uranium
 projects, the Cigar Lake and McArthur River projects; and finally, its 600 000 square kilometres are home to
 only one million inhabitants who comprise two distinct categories: the 35 000 northern residents, mostly of
 native ancestry, and the majority of the population who live in the south.

<P>
The community relations programme's first action was to listen, through public hearings, to the communities'
 expressed concerns, which focused in the north upon radioactivity fears, employment and training
 opportunities and business development, and in the south upon environmental and health risks, proliferation,
 economic development and employment.

<P>
The response for the north consisted of offering jobs: about 50% of the employees of Saskatchewan's 
three uranium mines are northerners; offering training opportunities: these include school education on
 uranium mining, work orientation, and career development; business development: through purchasing
 power and preferential treatment, an example being Cameco's agreement with the trucking company NRT
 for an exclusive contract in return for NRT's increased training and employment of northeners; and a 
northern community liaison committee, to discuss issues of common interest such as water quality. 

<P>
Southern programmes are more conventional, supporting the local community through donations, sponsorship
 and employment schemes. Uranium Saskatchewan, the trade association, delivers public information 
programmes at all levels, particularly to schools. The governments also play  a role in maintaining public 
confidence in safety standards.

<P>
Today 80% of Saskatchewan's residents, compared with 65% in 1990, support continued uranium mining.
 This reflects the industry's community relations initiatives. Cameco's shares also trade at 3.5 times their 
1991 issue price. Only a small segment of anti-nuclear activists takes a negative  view. Relationships 
with local communities, like uranium ore, are a valuable resource needing competent development.
