<P>
<H1>International law and climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The <A HREF = "fs250.html">UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change</A> was adopted in May 1992 and opened for signature in June at <A HREF 
= "fs207.html">UNCED</A> in Rio de Janeiro.1</B> Conventions 
among states are a key source of international law.<B> </B>Also called <B><I>treaties</B></I>, 
they set out obligations that are binding on their party states.<B><I> </B></I>As a 
<B><I>framework convention</B></I>, the climate treaty contains important principles and general 
obligations. Additional commitments may be agreed upon later in one or more 
<B><I>protocols</B></I>. <P>
<B>Customary international law also provides some general guidance</B> <B>on the legal 
implications of climate change</B>. An unwritten international norm becomes part of customary 
law if it is consistently followed over a long period of time by a significant number of states which 
accept it as a legal obligation. For example, if a particular commitment to act is repeatedly expressed 
at important international conferences, and if all the participating states act in accordance with it, then 
the commitment may become an obligation under customary law.<P>
<B>Existing customary law affirms the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural 
resources, although this right is by no means absolute.</B> Customary law also prohibits a state 
from allowing activities on its territory to inflict serious damage on the environment of other states or 
on parts of the environment that do not belong to any state. Although states are not prohibited from 
causing any environmental damage at all, they must make "reasonable use" of common resources such 
as the atmosphere. The problem is, what is "reasonable"? Exactly how much carbon dioxide is a state 
permitted to release into the atmosphere? How much forest may it turn into agricultural or industrial 
land? Customary law has no definitive answer.<P>
<B>Until 1992, international law did not address climate change directly.</B> Because climate 
change is a phenomenon of unprecedented scale and character, traditional legal concepts and 
mechanisms provided by treaties and customary law do not help much. A number of treaties already 
in force, notably <A HREF = "fs225.html">the Geneva Convention on 
Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete The 
Ozone Layer</A>, do deal with atmospheric pollution. However, they do not specifically address the 
causes and effects of climate change as such. <P>
<B>Non-binding statements by international climate conferences influenced the drafting of the 
Climate Change Convention by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a 
Framework Convention on Climate Change</B> INC/FCCC). The treaty drafters referred to the 
statements to evaluate the concerns and proposals of various states and regions. In this way, a number 
of concepts and principles were reaffirmed and highlighted. The following three paragraphs describe 
the most important of these principles:<P>
<B>Climate change is a "common concern of humankind".</B> Representing an effort to 
provide a basis for international action to protect the global climate, this concept was first introduced 
in a 1988 resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.2 It has since been supported by 
numerous international climate meetings.3 The legal problem is that climate change is not imposed by 
one state upon another state. As a result, the traditional legal principles governing transboundary 
pollution (which <I>is</I> imposed by one state upon another) do not apply. But if the atmosphere 
is a "common concern of humankind", all states have an interest and duty to protect it from serious 
harm. A state on one side of the globe is thus "affected" by a state on the other side of globe that is 
emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This principle is affirmed in the preamble to the 
Climate Convention.<P>
<B>States have "common but differentiated responsibilities" for combating climate 
change.</B> It is widely recognized that all states contribute to climate change and that all states 
may, to different degrees, suffer from it. But the industrialized states developed their economies over 
the past 150 years in part by treating the atmosphere as a free and unlimited resource, and they 
continue to generate the greatest quantity of greenhouse gases. Developing countries are now 
attempting to industrialize at a time when the atmosphere is no longer considered as free and 
unlimited. In addition, they still make a smaller contribution to climate change (although it will 
increase in the decades to come). The principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" 
proposes that, while all states should act to prevent damage to the atmosphere, developed countries 
should take the lead. This principle is widely recognized.4 It was incorporated into the <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">1987 Montreal Protocol</A> and it underlies the dual 
standard of commitments for developed and developing countries established by the Climate 
Convention.<P>
<B>Potentially dangerous activities should be restricted or prohibited even before they can be 
proven to cause serious damage (the precautionary principle).</B> Traditionally, activities were 
often not restricted or prohibited by legal rules until they had been proven to cause environmental 
damage. In other words, states were free in their activities unless and until a causal link between an 
activity and a particular damage had been established. This approach may not work, however, in the 
case of activities contributing to climate change. Scientists are still unsure about the exact timing and 
nature of climate change impacts, but if efforts to limit net greenhouse gas emissions are not initiated 
before scientific certainty is achieved, it may be too late to undo the damage. Therefore, the 
precautionary principle provides that activities threatening serious or irreversible damage should be 
restricted or even prohibited <I>before</I> there is absolute scientific certainty about their impact. 
This principle was discussed at many international climate conferences,5 and it has also been included 
in some recent environmental policy statements and conventions.6 The climate treaty embodies a 
precautionary approach, since states agreed to take action despite the remaining scientific 
uncertainties about climate change.<P>

A/AC.237/18(Part II)Add.1<P>
2  UN General Assembly Resolution 43/53 on the protection of global climate for present and  future generations of mankind, 6 
December 1988. <P>

Common Concern of Mankind in Relation to Global Environmental Issues, Malta, 13-15 Dec., 1990, (summary of the discussions 
and reports, edited by David J. Attard (Nairobi, 1991)).<P>
4  The principle was strongly supported by all "developing countries climate conferences" and was recognized by the UN General 
Assembly, the Second World Climate Conference, the Preparatory Committee of UNCED, the Toronto Conference Statement, the 
Hague Declaration, and the Noordwijk Declaration. It is also reflected in Principle 7 of the 1992 Rio Declaration (see relevant fact
