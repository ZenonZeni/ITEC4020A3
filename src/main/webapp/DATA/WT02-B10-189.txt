Washington Heights Community Service outpatient programs had a very productive and stable year. Compared to 1993, our census increased by 36 patients, and we delivered 391 more visits, which represents a slight increase. In September 1994, our outpatient programs successfully completed their state certification site visit, and were praised for the excellent clinical care delivered.

Some notable staff changes occurred. Alexis Brosen, M.D., resigned her position as director of the Inwood Clinic, and Siobhan Coomaraswamy, M.D. became the new director. Other changes at Inwood included the arrival of two new psychiatrists, Richard Kreuger, M.D. and Dora Cardenas, M.D., and the departure of two psychiatrists, Sarah Hartman, M.D. and Raul Soto, M.D. On the PI 6 in-patient unit, Deborah Cabaniss, M.D. resigned and Mary Bongiovi, M.D. became the new attending psychiatrist.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We were able to significantly improve therapeutic activities for our inpatients and outpatients under the leadership of Elaine Mullen, OTR. Ms. Mullen reorganized group programming in the PI 6 inpatient unit and helped recruit two new occupational therapists.

WHCS faculty remained active in the area of HIV/AIDS and people with mental illness. In addition to continued publications of our research findings, the second year of our federal Center for Mental Health Services training grant allowed us to train more than 2,000 mental health providers. We held three large conferences (New York, Albany, Buffalo) and conducted  on-site workshops and grand rounds at numerous mental health programs in the tri-state area. Four thousand copies of the HIV Risk Reduction Manual, written by WHCS staff, were distributed throughout the English-speaking world. This manual is based on ongoing HIV risk reduction groups at the Audubon and Inwood Clinics. Dr. Francine Cournos authored Commonly Asked Questions about HIV/AIDS and People with Mental Illness, which was distributed nationwide by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. In addition, WHCS worked with Housing Works, Inc., a program for HIV infected people, in the development of their mental health services.

WHCS continues to be a popular site for the training of students of all disciplines.
