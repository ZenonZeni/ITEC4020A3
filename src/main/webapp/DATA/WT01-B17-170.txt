<b><i>Ritalin and Hyperactive Children</i></b>
<p>

Why are so many American children bouncing off the walls with hyperactivity, concentration problems, and attention deficit disorder? Why is Ritalin, a potentially addictive stimulant derived from the same drug family as cocaine, now prescribed regularly for an estimated 1.3 million children between the ages of 5 and 14, or 3-5% of all U.S. schoolchildren? <p>
Since 1990, the number of children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) has grown from 750,000 to almost 4 million. Symptoms of ADD are variable, including a spaced-out quality, concentration difficulties, excessive activity, low impulse control, loud, pushy, defiant, or careless behavior, and a quality of seeming to be “motorized.” <p>
Conventional physicians now routinely prescribe Ritalin to ADD children and adolescents, despite the fact that 25-40% show no response to medication, that its side effects (appetite loss, insomnia, tics, and growth retardation) are serious, and that clinical research demonstrates a lack of consistent long-term benefits. Ritalin, stimulants, and antidepressants do not treat the root causes of ADD; at best, they suppress some of its symptoms. Even more alarming, teenagers are using Ritalin as an illicit drug, crushing and snorting it like cocaine, according to naturopathic physicians Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman, N.D., M.S.W., and Robert Ullman, N.D. <p>
Facts such as these strongly suggest it is time to seek an alternative. Based on the Ullmans’ results in treating 400 children with ADD at their Northwest Center for Homeopathic Medicine in Edmonds, Washington,  homeopathic remedies can produce a 70% success rate in reversing ADD symptoms. <p>
Homeopathic remedies are safe, inexpensive, completely nonaddictive, and deep-acting. In contrast, the effects of Ritalin last about 4 hours. The Ullmans, who began treating ADD children in 1987, have been “astounded at how homeopathy transformed the lives of many of these children in a positive way.” <p>
Based on their clinical experience and the reported cases of other homeopathic physicians, “homeopathy offers an effective alternative to stimulants and antidepressants in the treatment of ADD.” While changing a child’s diet is helpful (eliminating sugars, food additives, and processed foods), the Ullmans contend that using homeopathic remedies produces a more “consistent, profound, and lasting impact.”<p>
Homeopathy does not have a single cookbook answer for ADD because every child’s case is individual and must be prescribed accordingly, state the Ullmans. But drawing on their casebook of 400 treatments, they present a representative sampling of the types of homeopathic remedies they have found to be effective against the complicated ADD symptom picture.<p>
Jimmy, aged 9, had been in and out of foster homes, experiencing both physical abuse and neglect. His parents were alcoholics and he associated using the toilet with being beaten by his mother in the bathroom. In class, Jimmy was disruptive, hyperactive, fidgety, impatient, completely restless, and a nuisance to other children; at night, he slept fitfully. This is a classic profile of an ADD-troubled child. <p>
The Ullmans prescribed homeopathic Veratrum album (from white hellebore) and observed that, within a few days, Jimmy’s hyperactivity was “dramatically” reduced. Over the next days and weeks, his condition continued to improve, and over the next 2 years in which the Ullmans tracked him, Jimmy continued to do well. <p>
Darin, aged 5, exhibited oppositional behavior; he was anxious, insecure, impatient, and fearful, and had trouble concentrating. His mother had started him on Ritalin, then abandoned that for a natural alternative.  The Ullmans prescribed homeopathic Capsicum (red pepper), which produced gradual but steady improvement over 2 months.<p>
Most importantly, the Ullmans urge parents that before they fill the doctor’s prescription for Ritalin, they carefully consider the alternatives. <p>
