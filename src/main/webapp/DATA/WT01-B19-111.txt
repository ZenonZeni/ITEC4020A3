To the Iowa District Court: <br>
<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">This letter is a plea for mercy and leniency.&nbsp; Allen Helmers
does not deserve to go to prison.&nbsp; He is a medical patient
with a legitimate need for medical marijuana.&nbsp; I have
attached a letter from his doctor which clearly shows that
marijuana is a medical necessity for Allen Helmers. <br>
<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The matter of marijuana as a medical necessity is one which has
been previously considered by a sister court, the Pottawattamie
County District Court, in the case of </tt></b></font><a

<br>

size="4"><b><tt> from Allen Helmers' doctor that he easily
satifies the elements of the medical necessity defense. Although
a probation revocation hearing is not a criminal trial, it would
be absurd to think that a valid defense in a criminal trial would
not be equally valid in a probation revocation hearing, and I
plead with the court to so find in this case. <br>
<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">As the administrative law judge said in The Matter of Marijuana
Rescheduling, DEA Docket No. 86-22, Sept. 6, 1988, at pages 58
and 59, comparing marijuana to convention medications,
&quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot;&nbsp; Allen
Helmers should not be forced to take toxic poisonous chemicals
for the rest of his life, when a natural healing herb is
available and legal according to the defense of medical
necessity. <br>
