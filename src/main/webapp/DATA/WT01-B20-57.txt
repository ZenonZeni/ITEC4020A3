<p align="center"><b><u>Update</u></b><b>: Jimmy Montgomery
Shares Prison Cell With 40 Prisoners</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 6,</b> Wheelchair-bound Jimmy Montgomery
has been forced to share a cell with <i>forty</i> other prisoners
who risk infection from the chronic anti-biotic resistant
infections afflicting the lower half of his body.&nbsp; On
Monday, Jimmy was picked up by law enforcement officials and sent
back to prison in Lexington, Oklahoma to serve the balance of a
ten year sentence for possession of less than two ounces of
pot.&nbsp; According to Oklahoma NORML Coordinator Michael
Pearson, cannabis reform activists in Oklahoma (and nationwide)
have been calling the Governor and the chief of the Bureau of
Corrections. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pearson says that &quot;Jimmy's case is getting incredible
statewide media exposure.&nbsp; The Montgomery case is seen by
even the most conservative politicians as demonstrating why non-violent
offenders shouldn't be taking up valuable prison space.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be
reached at 405-521-2342.&nbsp; OK NORML, Michael Pearson, can be
reached at 405-840-HEMP.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile... Willie Nelson's Pot Charges
Dropped</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 4, Waco, TX</b> About the time that
Oklahoma was re-imprisoning Jimmy Montgomery, an undoubtedly
relieved McLennan County District Attorney decided to drop
marijuana possession charges against Willie Nelson rather than
appeal an adverse cour ruling.&nbsp; The court had ruled that the
enormously popular Texas singer/songwriter had not been properly
advised of his rights and also that there was not probable cause
to search his Mercedes.&nbsp; Police had spotted the remains of an
alleged marijuana cigarette in the ash tray of Nelson's car when
they found Nelson taking a roadside nap.&nbsp; Since many Texans
who drive Mercedes roll their own tobacco cigarettes as an economy
measure, the police were not justified in assuming that the
cigarette was anything other than harmless tobacco, which is
still legal.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nelson is very candid about his marijuana use and
has even talked about having smoked marijuana on the roof of the
White House when Jimmy Carter was President -- a few years after Montgomery
was paralyzed in an industrial accident.&nbsp; Had Nelson been
tried and convicted he could have been sentenced to six months in
jail ... and the District Attorney might have had to leave the
country.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The contrast between the treatment of Nelson
with that of Jimmy Montgomery illustrates the extreme disparity
in consequences for the one thousand Americans who are arrested
everyday on marijuana charges.&nbsp; For some, it is only an
embarrassment.&nbsp; Others find their lives ruined.&nbsp; It is better
to be rich, famous and healthy than to be poor, obscure and
crippled -- especially if you want justice.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Police Chief Of Hawaii County Suffers From A
Case Of 'Reefer Madness'</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 24,</b> In a letter written to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Hawaii County Police Chief Wayne G.
Carvalbo stated: &quot;We request the reference to
&quot;hemp&quot; be deleted from executive Order Number 12919 ...
From a local law enforcement standpoint, we view the promotion of
hemp in Executive Order 12919 as a vehicle being utilized by pro
marijuana groups to promote the legalization of marijuana.&nbsp;
The proponents are using the false environmental arguments to
promote the use of a drug that bears substantial health risks to
the user.&quot;</p>
