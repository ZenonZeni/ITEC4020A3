<TITLE>Scientists Turn Up the Heat for Exploratory Studies Facility Alcove Thermal Tests</TITLE>

<BODY>
Scientists and engineers know that the up-to-70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste slated for disposal in the Nation's first repository will create a great
deal of heat for a very long time. What they are less sure of is precisely how the moisture in the
rock at Yucca Mountain will respond to this added heat. Determining that is crucial; this heat
will impact the performance of the repository both during its first 100 years, when it is
operational, and the subsequent thousands of years after it has been sealed.<P>
<P>
Researchers at Yucca Mountain will work to resolve these issues with several short- and
long-term heater tests in alcoves and small tunnels excavated along the main tunnel of the
mountain's underground Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF). These thermal tests, the first of
which began on August 26, 1996, will examine the effects of waste-generated heat on the
hydrological, mechanical, and geochemical properties and processes in the rock. <P>

<P>
Understanding the various heat-driven processes that take place in the rock will help researchers
confirm elements of the waste containment and isolation strategy for a repository at Yucca
Mountain, as well as facets of repository design.

<H3>Scientists Focus on Physical and Chemical Processes</H3>

There are four processes that concern researchers in these tests: thermal, mechanical,
hydrological, and chemical.<P>
<P>
The increase in temperature and attendant flow of heat in the rock are examples of thermal
processes. Movement in or of the rock, and changes in the rock stress, are mechanical processes.
Stress brought about by external forces causes strain, or deformation, in an elastic material such
as rock. The movement of water in the rock, in contrast, is a hydrologic process, while the
behavior and changes in minerals subjected to sustained heat are chemical processes.<P>
<P>
Scientists have developed conceptual models of these processes as they might occur at Yucca
Mountain. These are based upon laboratory tests, smaller heater tests conducted elsewhere in the
country (including at the Nevada Test Site), observations of natural geothermal phenomena, and
knowledge of the laws of physics.<P>
<P>
The thermal tests planned for Yucca Mountain will help scientists refine and confirm these
models. This will give greater credibility to those parts of the assessment of the repository's
performance that are based on such models.<P>
<P>
The heat generated by spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in the region close to
the waste packages will be important to the performance of the waste packages and the repository
rock itself. Mechanical, hydrological, and chemical processes in these areas can take place even
in the absence of heat from emplaced waste; however, they are intensified in the presence of heat,
and are affected by each other. This interaction is called "coupling." An understanding of coupled
processes is essential for an assessment of the performance of a repository.<P>

<H3>What Happens to Water in Rock Pores When the Rock Is Heated?</H3>

A primary reason why Yucca Mountain is being characterized for a repository is that the rock
there is unsaturated. The unsaturated zone refers to the rocks and soil above the water table.
There is some water in this rock, though that water may move very slowly. Little or no water is
expected to reach the emplaced waste, and any water that does contact the waste packages is not
expected to leave the repository for thousands of years. As a result, the waste will remain
isolated.<P>
<P>
One of the objectives of the thermal tests planned for Yucca Mountain, however, is to observe
the actual behavior of whatever water can be found in the rock when it is mobilized by heat. As
the rock is heated by the waste, the existing water that fills about two-thirds of the pores of the
rock will evaporate and be driven off in all directions away from the waste. As this water vapor
reaches cooler regions in the rock, some of it will condense. It can then drain through fractures to
the water table below, bypassing the repository. Or it may be absorbed into the rock near where it
condenses. This process could saturate the rock some distance below and above the waste. After
many thousands of years, when the heat from the waste has completely dissipated, some of the
condensed water above the waste may move down to the waste. If it is able to corrode the steel
waste packages and dissolve the wastes, it could ultimately transport radionuclides into the
accessible environment.<P>

<H3>A Naturally Ventilated Mountain</H3>

Other scenarios are being considered as well. The host rock in Yucca Mountain is highly
fractured, and gases, such as air or water vapor, move through it quite rapidly. The fractures
provide the mountain with natural ventilation, driven largely through variations in barometric
pressure at various locations around it. The heat from emplaced waste is expected to raise the
temperature of the rock very slowly, and evaporation will occur slowly as well. Much of the pore
water could, as a result, be carried away as vapor through the fractures instead of condensing
above or below the waste.<P>

<H3>Shake-Down Test Precedes Main Test</H3>

Before beginning the main part of the ESF thermal test, called the Drift Scale Test, scientists
scheduled a small-scale shake-down test, called the Single Heater Test. This test, which began in
late August 1996, took place in an alcove situated off an observation tunnel parallel to the main
thermal test tunnel. All instruments to be used in the later Drift Scale Test are being tried out in
the shake-down phase. The heating cycle in the shake-down phase will last about 9 months,
followed by a similar period of cooling. The shake-down phase also will yield data on the rock's
thermal properties and the effect of heat upon mechanical properties. These data are needed to
interpret the more complex results from the Drift Scale Test which, in turn, are needed for the
repository design. The results of the shake-down phase will contribute to the site viability
assessment scheduled for 1998.<P>

<H3>Main Drift Scale Test Will Approximate Thermal Conditions in a Waste Emplacement
Tunnel</H3>

Now scheduled for the fall of 1997, the Drift Scale Test will take place in an area east of the ESF
main tunnel, just beyond the curve at the bottom of the north ramp. An observation drift, which
scientists will use to monitor and observe the main test tunnel, has been excavated at a station
located 2,827 meters (9,275 feet) from the facility's main entrance. Construction of the test
alcoves and related small tunnels began in January 1996.<P>
<P>
In the Drift Scale Test, a 55-meter (180-foot) length of tunnel similar to the ones that would
contain waste in a repository will be heated for a period of at least 2 years. Rocks, as anyone who
has ever made a campfire will attest, can take as long to cool as to heat. This heat-up period will
therefore be followed by a similar, if not longer, period of cooling. During both the heating and
the cooling periods, numerous observations and measurements will be made.<P>
<P>

Heating the tunnels, or drifts, will be achieved with electric heaters placed on the floor. These
heaters will be of a size, shape, and material similar to the waste packages being considered for
emplacement. Smaller-diameter heaters, called wing heaters, will be inserted into both walls of
the drift to simulate heating in adjacent drifts. An observation drift has already been excavated
parallel to the heated tunnel location, and various types of instruments will be installed in holes
drilled from both drifts.<P>
<P>
During this test, the temperature of the accessible rock surfaces in the thermal test alcoves and
the nearby main ESF drift will be systematically mapped by infrared thermal imaging. This will
permit scientists to detect any escaping moisture/air since the gas flow affects the local rock
temperature.<P>
<P>
The high temperatures generated by the thermal tests will be limited, for the most part, to the
alcoves that were excavated for them. Workers and scientists moving about within the ESF will
be able to bypass these alcoves during the course of their excavation and research activities
without exposing themselves to excess heat or its effects.<P>
