<H2>The NESEA and the Tour de Sol</H2>
</center>
The American Tour de Sol is organized by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, the nation's leading regional association involved in promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting, renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts, NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields of transportation, building construction and energy.<p>

Race Director Nancy Hazard says, " We are really excited about the breadth of entries which include a pre-production prototype, an electric bus, hybrid electric vehicles, electric motorcycles, and numerous sedan and truck conversions. Electric vehicles, which will be on many sales lots in 1998, are good for the economy and good for the environment."<p>

Major sponsors for this year's American Tour de Sol are the U.S. Department of Energy, the Waterbury Region Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, the Maine Solar Blast, and the Discovery Channel.<p>

For more information about the work of NESEA, contact us at 50 Miles Street, Greenfield, MA 01301. Our phone number is 413 774-6051.  And our email address will soon be here.<p>

<H3>History:  The history of electric cars is longer than that of internal combustion vehicles.</H3>

<DIR>
<LI>The first electric car was built in Scotland in 1837, by Robert Davidson.
<LI>EV's were widely produced in the 1880's when the lead acid battery was perfected.
<LI>2,000 taxi cabs were manufactured for New York's Fifth Avenue Coach Co.
<LI>1892 - First production electric car created a sensation when exhibited in Chicago.
<LI>1899 - Belgian-built electric racing car "La Jamais Contente" (Never Satisfied) set a world land speed record of 68 mph.  In 1902 that record was broken by a gasoline powered car, and the gas car has retained that record.
<LI>1910 - electric vehicle's first heyday and were a favorite of the women.  They were clean, quiet and easy to start.
<LI>1913 - twenty companies were producing 6,000 electric vehicles and trucks per year.
<LI>By 1930, the introduction of the electric starter, and Ford's Model T had virtually eliminated electric vehicle companies.
<LI>1973 - Oil Embargo and a resurgence of interest in electric vehicles.
<LI>1976 - Congress passed the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research and Development Act over protests from Detroit, and the veto of then President Gerald Ford.
<LI>By 1977, Japan had 13,000 EV's in operation, Great Britain had 70,000 and the United States had 3,000 with projections of 25 million by the year 2000.  Gas prices were then lowered and the electric car declined again.
<li>The 1980's saw the resurgence of the electric car as races such as the Tour de Sol in Switzerland started in 1982, and the World Solar Challenge in Australia in 1987.

<B>Efficiency</B> - the efficiency of an electric car is measured in miles per kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity, which typically costs 8-12 cents.  Efficiency usually refers to the amount of energy drawn from the battery to enable the car to drive down the road. Typically, an electric sedan can drive 4-9 miles on one kwh. Utility vehicles such as vans and pick-ups drive 1-5 miles on one kwh. Motor scooters, one person solar racing cars can achieve driving efficiencies of 18-26 miles per kwh, or 250 miles for $1.00.  Efficiency depends on the weight and aerodynamics of the car, and the efficiency of the motor and drive train. Other efficiencies which are not considered above, but are looked at by the NESEA Energy Challenge, include electrical generation, electrical distribution, charger and battery efficiencies.<P>

<B>Electric Vehicle (EV)</B> - a car, bus, van, or motorcycle with an electric motor which is powered by electricity stored in a battery, flywheel  or fuel cell.<P>

<B>EV</B> - see electric vehicle<P>

<B>Flywheel</B> - a mechanical device that stores energy by spinning an object at very high speeds.<P>

<B>Fuel Cell</B> - battery-like unit that converts a fuel, such as hydrogen or methanol directly to electricity.<P>

<B>Grid, or Electric grid</B> - network of transmission lines, substations, distribution lines, and transformers used in transmitting electricity from power plants to users.<P>

<B>Grid Power</B> - electricity generated and distributed by a large electric utility company.<P>

<B>Grid Charged</B> - charged from electricity generated by a large electric utility company.<P>

<B>Hybrid Electric Cars</B> - a car that has both an electric motor and a small fossil fuel powered internal combustion engine generating electricity, or flywheel, or fuel cell. The fossil fuel powered generators run at constant speed so they are very efficient, usually complying with the ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) specifications set by California.<P>


<B>LEV</B> - Low Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)<P>

<B>Non-polluting</B> - does not produce substances commonly recognized as harmful to humans or the earth.  Common air pollutants are carbon dioxide, sulfurous oxides, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, and CFC's (see FACT SHEET: Transportation, Energy and the Environment)<P>

<B>Photovoltaics, or PV</B> - a device that converts light directly into electricity.  Photovoltaics produce direct current or DC current and are sometimes referred to as solar cells, photovoltaic cells, or PVs.<P>
 
<B>Production Prototype</B> - a product, or car, which is being considered for mass production.<P>

<B>PV</B> - see photovoltaics.<P>

<B>Range</B> - the distance an electric car can travel before the batteries need to be recharged.<P>

<B>Solar</B> - of, derived from, or relating to the sun.  Produced or operated by the action of the sun's light or heat.  Electricity generated directly from the sun's light = solar electricity.<br>

      Heat generated by the sun = solar thermal energy.  Solar thermal energy may ultimately be converted to electricity.  Some people consider wind a form of solar energy.<P>

<B>Solar Car, Solar/electric Car, or Solar-assisted Electric Car</B> - an electric car whose batteries are charged wholly or partially by electricity produced by photovoltaic cells which are installed on the car.  PV panels can produce enough electricity to travel from 5-250 miles per day.  The range is dependent upon the size (sq. ft) and efficiency of the PV cells, and the efficiency of the car itself.  Commuter cars typically gain 5-15 miles per day, while some racing cars can travel 250 miles on a sunny day.<P> 
 
<B>Solar Electricity</B> - electricity which is produced by the light from the sun.  The photovoltaic cell is the mechanism used for the electrical generation.<P>

<B>Solar Cells</B> - see photovoltaics.<P>

<B>Torque</B> - a force that produces, or tends to produce rotation and the measure of the effectiveness of that force.<P>

<B>ULEV</B> - Ultra Low Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)<P>

<B>ZEV</B> - Zero Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)<P>
