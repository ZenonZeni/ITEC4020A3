<P>
At Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management, we believe that
stock prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected
future earnings of companies, their &quot;fundamental value.&quot;
Over time, we believe that the price of a company's stock will
converge towards this fundamental value, and that any investor
who can accurately determine fundamental value and apply a disciplined
investment process to select undervalued stocks (based on a comparison
between current prices and fundamental value) will outperform
the market over time.
<P>
Our research convinces us that modest valuation errors among
groups of similar companies are present in every sector of the
market. We have developed a <A HREF="model.html" >series of quantitative models </A>which
rigorously analyze fundamental data to identify these misvaluations.
Using the results from these models, we build broadly diversified
portfolios of these undervalued stocks, holding the individual
stocks until the market recognizes and corrects the misvaluation.
Our Fund's portfolios are composed of undervalued stocks from
every size sector and industry group represented in each Fund's
specific benchmark, with the typical portfolio consisting of several
hundred stocks.
<P>
Each Barr Rosenberg Mutual Fund relies on our proprietary stock
selection and risk models. In constructing the portfolios for
the Funds, we will avoid significant deviations from the size,
industry and risk factor characteristics of the respective benchmark.
In addition, we will not seek to earn extraordinary return by
timing the market, so the Funds will remain nearly fully invested
in equities at all times.
