<H1>The economics of climate 
change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Global climate change is an economic issue because any policy response we 
pursue will involve sacrifices.</B> If we take measures to reduce our greenhouse gas 
emissions substantially or to adapt to climate change impacts, we will have to pay for 
these efforts by diverting resources away from other activities. If climate change impacts 
are still felt despite our efforts, then we will have to suffer the consequences of 
environmental damage. The economics of global climate change is primarily about how to 
balance these sacrifices.<P>
<B>A balanced policy response must seek to reduce both greenhouse gas 
concentrations and the damage they cause. </B>Atmospheric concentrations can be 
lowered by abating emissions and by creating new "sinks" for absorbing greenhouse gases 
(by planting trees for example). Meanwhile, the damage from the remaining greenhouse 
gases can be lessened by constructing dikes and sea walls or by developing new seed 
varieties that are better suited to a changed climate. Because there is no feasible policy 
response in the short term for bringing greenhouse gas concentrations back to 
pre-industrial levels, some measures for adapting to the expected impacts of climate 
change will be essential. The optimal balance between abatement and adaptation will 
depend on each policy’s costs and benefits. One economic study shows that, while some 
abatement of emissions is warranted, it would be less than the amount required to stabilize 
concentrations at their current levels. (See fact sheet 227.)<P>
<B>The cost of a climate change policy can be estimated by calculating the change 
that it produces in human well-being. </B>One way to estimate this change is to 
determine the additional income that would be required to make society as well off with 
the policy as it would be without it. Economists generally agree that the per-ton cost of 
making the first modest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would be small. However, 
after the cheapest solutions for reducing emissions have been exhausted, the per-ton cost 
would start rising steeply as further reductions are made via more expensive solutions. 
Estimates vary widely of just how much total abatement would actually cost, and of the 
point at which incremental costs would begin to rise steeply. There is even substantial 
disagreement over the cost of cutting emissions by just one ton (the first "unit of 
abatement"). Some analysts argue that this cost would actually be negative because the 
first reductions could be achieved by reforming policies that currently discourage energy 
conservation. Others disagree. In any case, most economists believe that the total cost of 
reducing emissions by a significant amount would be high - more than one percent of 
gross domestic product (GDP). (See fact sheet 228.)<P>
<B>The benefits of a climate change policy can be estimated by calculating how 
much the policy reduces environmental damage.</B> Calculating the benefits of a 
climate change policy is even more controversial among economists than is estimating the 
costs. An order-of-magnitude estimate can be obtained by asking how much of an 
economy would be seriously affected by climate change. For some industrialized countries, 
it seems that the answer is not more than 1-3% of GDP. However, for other countries - 
including island nations and countries with very large agricultural sectors - the 
percentage could be much higher. One weakness of estimates based on GDP is that not all 
goods and services that would be affected by climate change appear in conventional 
national-income statistics. A loss of biological diversity, for example, would not be 
captured in GDP figures. Finally, the benefits of a particular policy may not be realized for 
many years because the climate system responds slowly to changes in greenhouse gas 
concentrations. This lag raises the issue of whether the value of benefits should be 
discounted and, if so, at what rate (economists use discount rates to put a <I>current</I> 
value on a future benefit). (See fact sheet 229.)<P>
<B>Once policy-makers have determined what their objectives are, economists can 
offer insights into how to craft the most cost-effective policies. </B>Economists 
generally prefer economic instruments to direct regulation. Two particular proposals for 
economic instruments have received the most serious attention. The first is to impose a tax 
on carbon dioxide emissions (fact sheet 230). Several countries - including Sweden, 
Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands - already levy a national carbon tax, and the 
European Community too may soon adopt a uniform but nationally-administered tax. The 
second proposal is to set a quantitative limit on the global emissions of a greenhouse gas 
and then to allow emissions permits to be traded like ordinary goods and services (fact 
sheet 231). To date, no country has implemented a scheme of tradable permits for emitting 
greenhouse gases. However, a conceptually identical approach is being used in the US to 
limit the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the emission of gases that cause 
acid rain.<P>
<B>Making a significant reduction in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse 
gases will require international coordination and agreement.</B> When one country 
reduces its emissions, all countries benefit. But the country reducing its emissions will 
incur a substantial cost and will receive only a fraction of the total benefit achieved by its 
actions. Clearly, the economic incentive for any nation to reduce emissions unilaterally is 
very small. At the same time, assuming that no country is a net gainer from climate 
change, all countries would benefit from a greater reduction in global emissions. 
Nevertheless, negotiations for a climate change convention proved extremely difficult, and 
the resulting treaty contains only limited commitments for stabilizing emissions. While a 
few strong agreements for reducing emissions have been negotiated in the past - the 
best-known example being the Montreal Protocol for phasing out CFCs (fact sheet 224) 
- climate change is a much more complex and challenging issue, particularly because of 
the difficulties over sharing costs and benefits. (See fact sheet 232.)<P>
