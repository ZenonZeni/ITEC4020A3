During the year, the collection continued its rapid growth with the acquisition of many new books and journals. The journal collection was enhanced with several new titles from areas of current research and clinical interest. Notable among these were Anxiety and Human Brain Mapping. The subscription to Anxiety was initiated due to the ongoing interest in anxiety and panic disorder at the Institute. Together with Journal of Anxiety Disorders, this journal offers a convenient source for maintaining literature awareness in the anxiety disorders field. Human Brain Mapping is a richly illustrated journal which offers a source for the many Institute scientists investigating brain imaging and behavior. Book acquisitions included the latest edition of the DSM publications, which now consume almost an entire shelf. The library maintains a collection of all the DSMs from the first psychodynamically based system, published in 1952, to the present multiaxial classification.

Literature searching on compact disc continued to be a heavily used service of the library. An estimated 8,000 search sessions were conducted during the year on the four work stations provided. The terminals were busy throughout the day and waiting lines were a common occurrence. The work stations were also busy during Saturday hours. During the year, the library attempted to improve the delivery of database services by entering into an agreement with Columbia University to subscribe to PsychInfo, a psychological database that offers many improvements over the PsychLit database currently used by the library. Among these benefits are increased coverage, faster response time, and lower cost. <BR>
The database will also be on the ColumbiaNet system, making it accessible from office computers throughout the Institute. It will no longer be necessary to travel to the library to conduct searches.

Interlibrary loans to other institutions have continued to be an important function of the library. Memberships in clearinghouse organizations such as the Medical Library Center of New York and the Northeast Regional Medical Library network have enhanced the library's visibility and have made the collection accessible to libraries throughout the country. Any library with a computer terminal and a subscription to the journal holdings microfiche of the Medical Library Center can request an interlibrary loan of a journal article and know in advance that it is in the library's collection. As a result, interlibrary loan statistics have risen this year to an all time high of 5,800 loans supplied to other institutions. By participating in these programs, the library has taken advantage of an excellent opportunity to share its resources and contribute to scientific scholarship.
