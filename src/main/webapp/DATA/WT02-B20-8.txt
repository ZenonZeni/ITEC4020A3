I.  How a Bill Becomes Law:  Steps in the U.S. Federal Legislative Process<BR> 
</B><P> 
1.     Most bills can be introduced in either house.  The procedure by which a bill becomes a law is much the 
same regardless of where the bill originates.  In this example, the bill is first introduced in the Senate, given a 
number, and referred to the proper committee.  If a bill overlaps the jurisdictions of two or more committees, it 
may be referred simultaneously or sequentially to them so that each may deal with the sections of the bill 
appropriate to its jurisdiction, or it may be referred to one committee for purposes of legislative strategy.<BR> 
<BR> 
2.     The Senate committee refers the bill to an appropriate subcommittee where the members will explore 
various sides of a subject through oral and written testimony given during public hearings on the bill.  Since the 
entire legislative body does not attend, all legislators who eventually vote on the bill lean heavily on the written, 
publicly available proceedings and the recommendations of the committee or subcommittee.  Congressional 
committees are increasingly exerting "legislative oversight" to monitor the implementation and evaluate the 
effectiveness of enactments through the use of hearings and written testimony.<BR> 
<BR> 
3.     The full committee meets in executive session (i.e., only members attend), sometimes closed, to consider 
the facts.  It may "kill" the bill, approve it with or without amendments, or draft a new bill.  Such sessions are 
known as "executive markups."<BR> 
<BR> 
4.     If the committee recommends the bill for passage, it is then listed on the calendar (i.e., an agenda or list of 
pending business).  When the committee recommends placing a bill on the calendar, it is said that "the 
committee has reported favorably."<BR> 
<BR> 
5.     The committee prepares a report which includes the purposes and scope of the bill, an explanation of 
committee amendments, proposed changes in existing law (along with existing law as is), a section-by-section 
analysis of the bill expressing views of department and agency heads whose views are solicited, minority views, 
and long range cost estimates.<BR> 
<BR> 
6.     The bill comes up for debate (in the Senate).  Depending on the degree of controversy, debate may last 
from a few hours to several weeks.  Amendments may be added.  The bill is then voted on.<BR> 
<BR> 
7.     If the bill passes, it goes to the other body, in this case the House of Representatives, and is referred to the 
proper committee.  However, similar bills on the same subject may move through both house chambers 
concurrently.<BR> 
<BR> 
8.     Hearings may be held by the committee(s) to which the bill was referred.<BR> 
<BR> 
9.     The committee may reject the bill, prepare a new one, or accept the bill with or without amendments.<BR> 
<BR> 
10.     If the committee recommends the bill for passage, it is listed on the calendar and is sent on to the Rules 
Committee.  (Note:  Only the House of Representatives has a Rules Committee.)<BR> 
<BR> 
11.     The Rules Committee is one of the most powerful committees in the House of Representatives.  After a 
bill has been recommended for passage by the committee to which it was referred, the Rules Committee can 
block it or clear it for debate before the entire House.  (If a bill is blocked, a discharge petition, signed by 218 
members of the House, can clear the bill for House consideration.  The procedure of obtaining a discharge 
petition seldom succeeds.)<BR> 
<BR> 
12.     The bill goes before the entire body, is debated, and is voted on.<BR> 
<BR> 
13.     If the bill is passed by the second body but contains major differences from the first body's version, either 
house may request a conference committee.  Representing both parties, the conferees meet and try to reconcile 
the differences between the two bills.<BR> 
<BR> 
14.     Generally, they reach an agreement and report back to their respective houses where the agreement is 
either accepted or rejected.  The compromise version is generally referred to in common parlance as the 
"conference report."<BR> 
<BR> 
15.     If the report is accepted by both houses, the bill is signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of 
the Senate and is sent to the President of the United States.<BR> 
<BR> 
16.     The President may sign or veto the bill within 10 days.  If he does not sign within 10 days and Congress is 
still in session, the bill automatically becomes law.  If Congress has adjourned before the 10 days have elapsed 
and the President has not signed the bill, it does not become law.  This is known as a "pocket veto."  If the 
President returns the bill with a veto message, it may still become law if passed by a two-thirds majority in each 
house.  This is called an "override."  Failure to override is referred to as "sustaining a Presidential veto."  If one 
house sustains, the other house need not vote at all.<BR> 
<BR> 
Note:     Any bill that is not acted upon before a Congressional session terminates must be reintroduced in one of 
the houses when the new session begins.<BR> 
<BR> 
<B>II.  Authorizing Legislation and Appropriating Funds<P> 
</B>In the Congress of the United States, it is most important to be aware of two quite distinct legislative 
processes, <B>appropriations</B> and <B>authorizations</B>.  These processes involve separate committees 
as well as separate legislative bills.  Authorizing committees create programs, set general directions, and alter 
existing federal programs.  In fact, they do everything but actually provide the dollars.  There are numerous 
authorizing committees in both houses of the Congress.  The primary one in the Senate that is concerned with 
programs for children with exceptionalities is the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  The primary one in 
the House that is concerned with programs for children with exceptionalities is the Education and Labor 
Committee.<P> 
It is the function of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to determine how many dollars shall be 
allocated.  There is only one Appropriations Committee in each of the houses.  All appropriations bills must 
initiate in the House.<P> 
Budget Committees exist in both houses with a charge to set overall budget priorities for each fiscal year, which 
begins on October 1.<P> 
It is vital that the dual system of the U.S. Congress be kept in mind.  A battle may be won with the authorizing 
committees by creating or changing a program, but if that program is to have meaningful financial support, 
energies must be shifted to the appropriations committees.  When a fiscal year begins and Congress has not yet 
enacted all the regular appropriations bills for that year, Congress passes a joint resolution, "continuing 
appropriations" for government agencies at rates generally based on their previous year's appropriations.
