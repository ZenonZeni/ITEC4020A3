<FONT SIZE=+1><B>First, Do No Harm-</B> 
<BR>Why Only Alternative Medicine Can Live up to This 
Ideal</FONT>
<P>

<IMG SRC="images/goldberg.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=171>
The writing is on the wall in such big letters these days
that you cannot see the wall anymore. What's the writing? That conventional
medicine is failing to abide by its prime directive: first, do no harm. You
need only read a national newspaper every day for a week to see the
evidence. The once formidable conventional medicine estab-lishment is
starting to cave in on itself from the weight of its own ignorance, greed,
and medical mistakes. It is, regrettably, also doing a lot of harm to its
patients and to the American economy. 
<P>I've been studying the newspapers
every day and here are some of my gleanings: 
<UL><LI>50,000 American women are
retaining lawyers for a probable class action suit against Wyeth-Ayerst,
makers of the Norplant contraceptive patch. The women are complaining of
headaches, weight gain, joint pains, strokes, paralysis, and other ills.
<LI>Complications and side effects from prescription drugs and prescribing
errors cost the nation $76 billion annually; of this, $47.4 billion a year
goes for 8.7 million hospital admissions to treat prescription drug-related
problems. 
<LI>Last year 6 million people received 87.3 million
prescriptions for Procardia and Adalat (calcium channel blockers) to treat
high blood pressure and angina; now experts believe these FDA-approved
drugs might cause heart attacks. 
<LI>Even though 2 million people are
dying from tuberculosis every year and 1.75 billion people, worldwide, are
presumed infected, big drug companies are unwilling to develop any new
drugs because there isn't enough profit in it for them. 
<LI> After a
Florida surgeon mistakenly amputated the wrong leg of a patient, a
colleague said 90% of the surgeons in Florida would have made the same
mistake. 
<LI>A New York surgeon consulted the wrong x-rays of a patient
then mistakenly operated on the healthy lobe of a cancer patient's brain.
<LI>California medical authorities seized a 6-year-old California boy
(whose mother had been treating his leukemia with herbs) and forced him to
undergo chemotherapy. 
<LI>A California woman received a  $24 million
settlement after she was left blind, paralyzed, and mute after a routine
diagnostic test. 
<LI>A Nashville neurologist tried to murder his
neurosurgeon boss by lethal injection for failing to advance his career.
<LI>The U. S. Justice Department filed charges against doctors and
hospitals in Danbury, Connecticut, for conspiring to fix prices to keep out
lower-priced managed-care companies.
</UL>
 The list grows every day. Do you get
the picture? The FDA is supposed to look after our health, but it's clear
they abandoned that charter a long time ago. They have everything
backwards. They approve Norplant, calcium channel blockers, and silicone
breast implants (which, within only a few years of approval, become gravely
dangerous to health), and they harass consumers, suppress information, and
confiscate herbs, amino acids, and vitamins, which have never been shown to
be bad for health. And according to a new study released by the Competitive
Enter-prise Institute (CEI) in Washington, D.C., the FDA may be the
cancer patient's worst enemy. 

<P>According to an article in The Washington
Times, ever since David Kessler, M.D., became FDA commissioner in 1990, the
FDA has &quot;severely suppressed&quot; new information about cancer treatments. The
CEI polled 160 oncologists and found that 76% declare the FDA should not
restrict information about unconventional, or &quot;off-label,&quot; uses of approved
drugs and devices. Yet in Kessler's &quot;reign of censorship,&quot; the FDA has
strenuously suppressed the free flow of information about new cancer
treatments, about 70% of which involve off-label uses. The CEI poll also
showed that 47% agree that the FDA's 5-year lag time in drug approval costs
lives; 66% said that FDA policy has directly obstructed their ability to
provide top care to at least one cancer patient.

<P>Oncologists polled believe
that cancer patients will die because doctors cannot learn of new,
effective treatments as a result of FDA's heavy-handedness about the spread
of information. 
<P>We don't need an FDA that acts so contrarily to the health
interests of both patients and doctors. Its attitude towards alternative
medicine is atrocious and unacceptable. Talk about a cancer cure and you'll
see the FDA police at your clinic doorstep. But it's true: there are cancer
cures and we're going to talk about them. I've seen them. I've met the
doctors who produce them. Be sure to read the first installment of
&quot;Cancer-How Leading Physicians Successfully Treat It,&quot; in this issue. It's
an advance excerpt from our groundbreaking new book on cancer cures, due
out in early 1996. 
<P>The free flow of information about new techniques,
substances, and treatments is not only the key to health, it is the only
way we will rejuvenate the American medical system. &quot;First, do no harm&quot;
means let's have informed doctors and patients, and to get that we need to
urge Congress to rein in the FDA and to pass the Access to Medical
Treatment Acts in the Senate (S-1035) and House (HR-2019). This is
imperative. 
<P>We need to get out the message first and foremost that
alternative medicine does no harm. It costs less, has no costly side
effects, in most cases gets better results, and can put the tools for
rejuvenation, longevity, and robust good health in your hands. It can also
help keep the U.S. from going bankrupt over a $1 trillion-plus annual
medical bill. 
<P>So I urge you to get with this powerful new grassroots,
consumer-based movement to rejuvenate American medicine. And while you're
at it, consider taking a few prudent steps to look after your own
rejuvenation. You'll find plenty of how-to tips in this issue. You must get
the toxins out of your body if you want to stay healthy. Please, if you
don't pay attention to this, you'll become a statistic- another American
whose health was lost to some degenerative disease. So arm yourself with
the life-saving information in this Digest and start rejuvenating today. It
won't harm you a bit.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../images/vote.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=111>It is imperative this year that all Americans who believe in 
alternative medicine write their U.S. senators and representatives expressing support
of the Access to Medical Treatment Act, HR-2019 (House bill) and S-1035 (Senate
bill).
Both bills would allow licensed physicians to provide any form of alternative
medicine, even if not FDA approved, provided it does not injure the patient.
