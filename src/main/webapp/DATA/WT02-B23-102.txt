<HR><CENTER><H2>Who Are These Guys?</H2>
<H3>A Short CompTIA History</H2></CENTER>

That’s a question being asked about computer resellers and computer 
industry vendors with increasing frequency these days – as corporate 
end-user customers sort out the important Information Technology 
choices that affect their organizations. And, since we are often 
judged by the company we keep, your  membership in the Computing 
Technology Industry Association will identify you and your 
organization as computer industry professionals dedicated to 
excellence in providing computer systems, service and support.

Specifically, CompTIA (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer Industry 
Association) is an organization of more than 6,180 full-service 
computer resellers, VARs, distributors and manufacturers in the United 
States and Canada. 

The diversity of the Computing Technology Industry Association 
membership parallels that found in the microcomputer industry as a 
whole. All members of CompTIA – computer hardware and software 
manufacturers, distributors, resellers and associates – are involved 
in some aspect of the sale, service and/or support of computer 
products and technologies. CompTIA members chalked up an impressive 
$50.5 billion in combined 1993 sales. And, according to the Santa 
Clara, Calif.-based InfoCorp, that will rise to about $75 billion by 
1998.

CompTIA’s reseller members, who are the heart of the Association, run 
the gamut from single location systems integrators with less than 
$500,000 in annual revenue to nationwide franchise groups with more 
than 600 locations and $500 million in annual revenue.

<CENTER><H2>Tools to Build Business Successes in the 
90s</H2></CENTER><PRE>

Think of membership in CompTIA as a roadmap to financial success on 
the information superhighway. Among the many CompTIA benefits are 
programs designed to bring greater business success and money-saving 
advantages to members. Some of CompTIA’s key benefits and programs 
include:

A+ Certification – 

A vendor-neutral, industry-wide program that certifies computer 
service technicians at a base-line competency level. Developed with 
input from industry companies, the exam was designed to help eliminate 
repetitive base-line level vendor training, thereby saving the company 
and the industry thousands of dollars each year.

Breakaway – 

Expanded and enhanced in 1994, the new conference format now gives all 
industry players a chance to access the latest on emerging 
technologies, the most well-known market researchers who chart the 
course of the computer industry, and successful business strategies 
for the 90s. Educational sessions at the Association’s annual 
conference focus on a wide array of emerging technologies and business 
survival topics.

A variety of Business Services and Special Discounts are available to 
members, such as:  Ads-On-Hold, 401(K) Employee Pension/ Retirement; 
Discounted Bank Card Processing Program; Business Liability and 
Medical Insurance; Car/Truck/Van Rentals; Check Protection; Errors 
&amp;Omissions Insurance; Long Distance Telephone and Fax Broadcast 
Savings Programs and more.

Computing Channels – 

CompTIA’s monthly publication, which provides computer resellers with 
information on critical industry issues and cutting-edge technology. 
For computer industry vendors, Computing Channels is an ideal 
advertising vehicle to increase your company’s &quot;mind-share&quot; 
in today’s crowded information marketplace.

Credit Interchange Program – 

The newly formed Credit Interchange Program, administered through the 
National Assn. of Credit Management (NACM),  was designed to create a 
&quot;super&quot; credit organization that includes manufacturers, 
distributors and aggregators who exchange credit information via 
on-line reports.

Electronic Commerce – 

After successfully developing a set of industry-wide standards, the 
EDI/Bar Code effort has moved into Phase II, which focuses on the 
development of an educational and awareness-building campaign; 
promotion of the concepts of Electronic Commerce within the industry, 
including the integration of fax, e-mail, imaging, bar codes and EDI; 
continuation of work on the application of EDI to the warranty and 
product returns processes; and improvement of the user- friendliness 
of all EDI transactions.

The Membership Directory – 

The Directory is a &quot;comprehensive referral service&quot; in 
print, detailing the products and services of all CompTIA members. The 
Directory is published annually.

Public Policy Office – 

Through its Director of Public Policy, CompTIA monitors and takes 
positions on public policy issues that critically affect the health of 
the computer industry or its various segments. 

The Association’s Director of Public Policy represents CompTIA before 
the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and regulatory bodies.

Task Forces, Sections and Committees – 

More than two dozen groups that meet year round and work to promote 
education and  communication on a wide variety of issues, including:  
Price Protection and Product Returns Guidelines; Software Licensing; 
Co-op/MDF Reimbursement; Freight Claims Losses; and more.

<CENTER><H2>CompTIA...Reasons to Join!</H2></CENTER>

<PRE>
Join the many manufacturers, distributors and associate members who 
have found that CompTIA gives them a competitive edge in the nineties.

Here are a few of the reasons it makes sense to join now:

     We’re making crucial efforts on industry issues that directly 
     affect your business — issues such as:

     •       product returns policies,
     •       price protection credits,
     •       co-op/MDF reimbursements,
     •       and electronic commerce implementation.

In each of these areas we’ve taken the lead in creating and promoting 
sound voluntary industry standards. 

Our Public Policy office also takes positions, lobbies and educates 
about such regulatory matters as…

     •       the information superhighway,
     •       a software rating system,
     •       telecommunications reform,
     •       tax fairness,
     •       the clipper chip,
     •       fair competition,
     •       and the FBI digital telephony bill.

Through CompTIA you get access to federal agencies, as well as to 
every key player in the industry.

The Credit Interchange alone can save you money as soon as you join by 
giving you complete credit information and credit histories for the 
resellers, VARs and system integrators you do business with every day.  
And there’s more. 

CompTIA can help you stand out from the crowd by showing you:

     •       how to increase your visibility;
     •       how to make your sales force effective;
     •       how to stretch your marketing dollars;
     •       how to form strategic partnerships that win customers;
     •       and how to ensure profitability in tough times.

We do this by providing you with the tools you need to build business 
success in the nineties.  Tools like: 

     *  A+ Certification for your computer service professionals, so 
        that your customers will know your staff can deal with all the 
        current technology.

     *  The Certified Document Imaging Architect (CDIA) designation, 
        to be launched in the third quarter of 1995,  that shows that 
        you possess the knowledge, expertise, and customer relations 
        skills essential for a successful imaging solution provider, 
        as defined by experts from companies across the industry. 

     *  A free subscription to Computing Channels magazine, the only 
        authoritative voice for the reseller channel.

     *  The annual Breakaway Conference, where you can hear about the 
        latest trends and technologies, learn new channel strategies, 
        and form relationships with other industry decision makers 
        like yourself.

seen it work for dozens of companies like yours.  That’s why we urge 
you to come aboard today and begin enjoying the benefits already being 
reaped by so many others.
