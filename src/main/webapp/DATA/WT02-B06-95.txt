<H2>US Cryptography Policy:  Why We Are Taking the Current Approach<BR>
July 12, 1996</H2>
<BR>
We live in an age of electronic information.  Information technology is
transforming society, creating new businesses, new jobs and new careers.
 The technology also creates new opportunities for crime, and new problems
in investigating and prosecuting crime.  As a result, electronic information,
be it corporate trade secrets, pre-release government crop statistics, or
a patient's medical records, must have strong protection from uninvited
modifications of disclosure.  Cryptography enables that protection.<BR>
<BR>
The United States is the world leader in information technology.  US firms
continue to dominate the US and global information systems market.  Retaining
this leadership is important to our economic security.  The Clinton Administration,
through its National Information Infrastructure initiative, has long recognized
that government has an important role as a facilitator and catalyst for
the industry-led transformation of the way we use computer and communications
technology to work and live.<BR>
<BR>
In particular, government has a strong interest in promoting the legitimate
use of robust encryption to support US international competitiveness, foster
global electronic commerce, prevent computer crime, and ensure that the
information superhighway is a safe place to conduct one's business.  At
the same time, there is a growing recognition, affirmed most recently by
the National Academy of Science that the use of encryption to conceal illegitimate
activities &quot;poses a problem for society as a whole, not just for law
enforcement and national security.&quot;  In brief, criminals can use encryption
to frustrate legal wiretaps and render useless search warrants for stored
electronic data.  We know of no technical solution to the problems that
would result from the global proliferation of strong cryptography <A HREF="#cracking">(see box)</A>.
 The implications of this are no small matter.<BR>
<BR>
Encrypted computer files have hampered the prosecution of child pornographers.
 Militia groups advise their members to use encryption to hide illicit weapons,
financial, and other criminal activities.  Aldrich Ames was instructed by
his Soviet handlers to encrypt computer files that he passed to the Soviets.
 And international terrorists and drug dealers increasingly use encryption
to prevent law enforcement officials from reading their voice and data transmissions.
 Grave crimes, such as a plot to shoot down several airliners over Chicago,
have been foiled by the use of wiretaps.  Had the FBI been unable to read
those transmissions, however, a major tragedy might have ensued.<BR>
<BR>
No restrictions apply to the US domestic use of cryptography, and the Administration
has no plan to seek restrictions.  Cryptography has long been controlled
for export for national security reasons, so as to keep it from getting
into the hands of foreign governments.  But is has today become a dual-use
technology, and international businesses want to use the same security products
both domestically and abroad.  The Administration is thus under strong pressure
to provide relief from cryptography export controls.<BR>
<BR>
For our cryptography policy to succeed, it must be aligned with commercial
market forces and operate on an international basis.  Further, it should
preserve and extend the strong position that US industry enjoys in the global
information systems marketplace.  Accordingly, the US government is working
with US industry and our international trading partners on an approach that
will protect information used in legitimate activities, assure the continued
safety of Americans from enemies both foreign and domestic, and preserve
the ability of the US information systems industry to compete worldwide.<BR>
<H3>Key Management and Recovery</H3>
A consensus is emerging around the vision of a global cryptography system
that permits the use of any encryption method the user chooses, with a stored
key to unlock it when necessary.  The encryption key would be provided voluntarily
by a computer user to a trusted party who holds it for safe keeping.  This
is what many people do with their house keys -- give them to a trusted neighbor
who can produce them when something unexpected goes wrong.  Businesses should
find this attractive because they do not want to lock up information and
throw away the key or give an employee -- not the company -- control over
company information.  An individual might also use this service to ensure
that she can retrieve information stored years ago.  This will require a
new infrastructure, consisting of trusted parties who have defined responsibilities
to key owners.  Under law, these trusted emergency key recovery organizations
would also respond in a timely manner to authorized requests from law enforcement
officials who required the key to decode information lawfully obtained or
seized from a subject of investigation or prosecution.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal government will use key recovery encryption on its own computers
because it makes good management sense.  It would be irresponsible for agencies
to store critical records without key recovery, risking the loss of the
information for programmatic use and the inability to investigate and prosecute
fraud or misuse of the information.<BR>
<BR>
A number of US and international companies are working with the US and other
governments to create a system of trusted parties who are certified to safeguard
the keys.  In some cases, organizations might guard their own keys.  In
other cases, persons will use the key recovery services provided by third
parties, one of a suite of services that will include electronic directories
and electronic &quot;notaries&quot; in support of online commerce.  Persons
will be free to choose the type and strength of encryption that provide
the degree of security they believe appropriate for their use.  Taken together,
an overall key management infrastructure is needed to make electronic commerce
practical on a global scale.<BR>
<BR>
Some commercial products and services which provide emergency key recovery
are already available.  Testing and refinement is needed before a widespread,
robust infrastructure is put in place.  The US government is committed to
supporting the development of such a key management infrastructure through
pilots and experimental trials.  The State Department is expediting the
review of several export license applications that test commercial key recovery
on an international scale.  An interagency working group is identifying
several potential governmental uses of commercial cryptography - both internal
transactions and in communications with the public - where key recovery
can be tested.  A plan outlining these government tests will be available
in August.  The government will be purchasing key recovery products for
its own use, and will adopt a Federal standard for evaluating such products
to assure agency purchasers that the key recovery features operate properly.
 The Department of Commerce will be establishing an industry-led advisory
committee to make recommendations regarding such a standard this Summer.<BR>
<BR>
While we are open to other alternatives, a key recovery system is the only
approach we know of that accommodates all public safety interests.  And
even it is imperfect.  Some people will not join voluntary systems, preferring
to run the risk of losing their keys and being unable to recover their encrypted
information.  Although in some countries (e.g., France) mandatory key escrowing
is already in effect, we are pursuing a market-driven approach in part because
we hope and believe that key recovery will develop as a cost-effective service
in an electronic commerce infrastructure.  We are encourage in this effort
by recent discussions we have had at the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) that are leading to international cryptography management
principles which support key recovery.<BR>
<H3>Export Controls</H3>
No matter how successful we are in realizing this vision, American users
of computer technology are demanding stronger encryption for international
use now.  Although we do not control the use of encryption within the US,
we do, with some exceptions, limit the export of non-escrowed mass market
encryption to products using a key length of 40 bits.  (The length of the
encryption key is one way of measuring the strength of an encryption product.
 Systems using longer keys are harder to decrypt.)  US industry asserts
that it is losing overseas sales to its European and Japanese competitors
because it cannot include stronger cryptography as a component of its commercial
software and hardware products.  It warns that loss of a significant share
of the world information systems market would cause serious economic damage
to the US economy, and could reduce the US government's ability to influence
the long term future of global cryptography.  It also argues that because
customers do not want to use one product in the US and a different one overseas,
export controls are causing US firms to provide an unsatisfactory level
of protection to their electronic information, making them vulnerable to
industrial espionage by their competitors and foreign governments.<BR>
<BR>
While 40 bit encryption products are still strong enough for many uses,
the Administration recognizes that some export liberalization may be useful
to build support for a key management regime.   Accordingly, we are actively
considering measures that would provide limited, temporary relief from cryptographic
export controls in exchange for real, measurable commitments from industry
(e.g., investments in products that support key recovery) toward the building
of a key management infrastructure.  The liberalization proposals under
discussion, which would continue the current one-time review of products
by the National Security Agency, include: permitting products using longer
key lengths to be exported to specific industry sectors such as health care
or insurance (similar to current policy for the financial sector); allowing
export of non-escrowed products to a list of trustworthy firms beyond those
sectors, with provisions for monitoring compliance to prevent product diversion
to other firms; export of cryptography-ready operating systems; and, most
dramatically, the transfer of jurisdiction over commercial encryption products
from the State Department's munitions list to the Commerce Department's
list of dual-use technologies.  Our goal is to obtain commitments from industry
by the Fall.<BR>
<BR>
We must, however, be careful in any relaxation of controls.  Other governments'
law enforcement and national security needs to access material encrypted
with US products could drive them to erect trade barriers by imposing import
controls on strong non-escrow encryption products.  In addition, we do not
want to do anything that would damage our own national security or public
safety by spreading unbreakable encryption, especially given the international
nature of terrorism.  Even 40 bit encryption, if widespread and not escrowed,
defeats law enforcement.<BR>
<BR>
It is for these reasons that we oppose the legislation (S.1726) introduced
in this Congress by Senator Burns and co-sponsored by Senator Lott and former
Senator Dole.  Although it contains some provisions, such as the transfer
of export control jurisdiction for commercial cryptography to the Commerce
Department, with which we could agree if constructed with appropriate safeguards,
the bill is unbalanced, and makes no effort to take into account the serious
consequences of the proliferation it would permit.<BR>
<BR>
The importance of the US information technology industry, the security stakes,
and increasing Congressional interest make it clear that there is an urgent
need for clear policy and direction.  The Administration's proposed approach
is broadly consistent with industry suggestions and conclusions reached
by the National Academy of Sciences in its report.  That report recognizes
the need to address a complex mix of commercial and security issues in a
balanced manner.  We agree with that need.  We also agree with the report's
recommendation that export controls on encryption products need to be relaxed
but not eliminated, and are actively considering ways of providing short
term relief. (We do not agree with the report's recommendation that we eliminate
most controls on 56-bit key length products.)  Finally, we agree that key
escrow is a promising but not fully tested solution, and are promoting the
kinds of testing the report recommends as a way of demonstrating the solution's
viability while providing stronger encryption internationally.<BR>
<BR>
We will continue discussion with industry, other members of the private
sector, the Congress, and governments at all levels to arrive at a solution
that promotes a future of safe computing in a safe society.<BR>

<H3>Cracking Coded Messages</H3>
We should not underestimate how difficult is to decode encrypted electronic
information.  One approach advanced in the popular debate is to provide
our law enforcement officials with more computing power.  At first glance,
this suggestion seems promising, because in theory any encrypted message
can be decoded if enough computing cycles are applied.  This approach fails
for five reasons:<BR>
<BR>
First, it relies on mathematical theory, not operational reality.  Digital
technology reduces voice, faxes, images, and text in any language to indistinguishable
1's and 0's.  A great variety of encryption products are also available.
 Under ideal conditions -- if the type of communication or file, language,
and encryption algorithm are known with certainty, and a short key is used
to encrypt the information -- a large, specially-designed computer could
decode a single message relatively quickly.  But State, local, and Federal
law enforcement officials do not operate in the clean confines of a high-tech
computer center.  They must first capture the 1's and 0's and discern what
kind of encryption they have encountered.<BR>
<BR>
Second, after the decoding problem is isolated, acquiring a machine to decode
a message is neither quick, easy or inexpensive.  Commercially available
computers could not be used because they will not have sufficient capacity.
 It would, for example, take years for the computers used to process all
social security claims, payments and earnings years to decode one message
using the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a widely used system originally
developed by the US government that uses a 56-bit key.<BR>
<BR>
Third, this approach betrays a misunderstanding of how crimes are prevented.
 Used only in the most critical cases, legally authorized wiretaps provide
crucial information just before a crime is to occur.  Thus a near real-time
ability to decode messages is needed.  Days or weeks are too long to wait
to find out that a terrorist attack is about to happen.<BR>
<BR>
Fourth, this approach fails to acknowledge the volume of messages that could
need decoding.  Each wiretap results in the collection of thousands of messages
relevant to the investigative purpose of the wiretap.  Even under the most
ideal conditions, had these messages been encrypted, the computing resources
required to decrypt them quickly would simply not be available.  And this
example does not include the additional burden of decrypting, if possible,
any digital information such as computer disks that are seized as evidence
after a crime has been committed.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, revealing the precise capabilities of law enforcement agencies
to decode messages, as would be necessary in order to present the fruits
of that work as evidence in court, could provide a tutorial to criminal
elements bent on eluding law enforcement.<BR>
