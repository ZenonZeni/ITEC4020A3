  <B>This Week's Topic: Car Wars</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>The trade war with Japan is primarily being fought with automobiles. The
U.S. trade deficit with Japan totals $60 billion, with more than half of
the deficit due directly to automobiles and auto parts. Even though they
favor their own market, the Japanese have respect for American workmanship,
particularly the Honda Corporation. Honda is manufacturing its sleek Honda
Accord Coupe, and its new Honda Stationwagon, only in Marysville, Ohio, and
plans to export 50,000 per year of them to Japan. The Accord Stationwagon
was designed from the ground up in the USA and will be exported to Europe
and Japan. Thanks to Honda U.S. auto exports to Japan increased significantly
last year.</B>
<P>
<B> According to a recent survey of prospective automobile purchasers conducted
by the Made in the USA Foundation most&nbsp;consumers do not know where cars
are made. More than seventy-five percent of American consumers surveyed thought
that the Pontiac LeMans was made in the U.S.A., when in fact it is made in
South Korea. The majority wrongly believed that the Honda Accord was imported
from Japan. Similarly, Motor Trend magazine awarded the Honda Accord it's
"Import Car of the Year" award for 1994 even though the Accord is made in
Marysville, Ohio! A significant problem, then, is determining what products
are made where so that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.
</B>
<P>
<B>Because of this confusion in the marketplace Made in the USA was able
to convince Congress that a new law was needed: The American Automobile Labeling
Act becomes law in the Fall of 1994. &nbsp;It requires all new cars to include
the U.S. content of the car on the price sticker. Because of this law every
Saturn will proudly announce that it is 98% American.</B>
<P>
<B> On the other hand the number of Americans who want to buy American products
is rising. According to Cambridge Reports, the number of Americans who made
a conscious decision against buying foreign products increased from 21% in
1985 to 39% in 1989. </B>
<P>
<B>Made in the USA Foundation estimates that in 1994 it now surpasses 50%.
In automobiles, the U.S. marketshare has increased from 73% to 75% since
1992. </B>
<P>
<B> The Saturn is taking the Asian imports on head-on. General Motors assigned
its top engineers to the Saturn division, already resulting in 16 patents
being issued for improvements to automobile technology and Saturn has 15
other patent applications pending. Saturn engineers developed the sixth
generation of anti-lock brakes. </B>
<P>
<B>Joining in the battle is the new Dodge/Plymouth Neon. Finally, Chrysler
Corporation has decided that it can replace its Mitsubishi-built Colts with
a superior American-made product. The new Neon all by itself will save thousands
of American jobs and turn a billion dollar corner in the trade imbalance
with Japan.</B>
