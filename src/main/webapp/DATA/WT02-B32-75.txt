Details of the inspection statistics for the UK have now been releasd by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).  The statistics have been compiled for submission to the EU Commission as required by the Directive on the Official Control of Foodstuffs.
<p>
The data has been published by country (England, Wales, Scotland and Norther Ireland) in addition to the combined data for the whole of the UK.  It is this last set which has been used to provide the data presented below.
<p>
The statistics are derived from data submitted to MAFF by all 589 food enforcement authorities in the UK for the period January - December 1995.  In the accompanying notes provided by MAFF, it is emphasiszed that official food control does not consist only of inspections, sampling and prosecutions.  There are other activities which enforcement authorites carry out which are not covered by the data.  These include:
<ul>
<li>the operation of the home authority principle whereby the enforcement authority in whose area the headquarters of a national and international company is based provides advice on all aspects of compliance with food law and acts as liaison and advisory point for other enforcement authroities who may have problems arising from the marketing of the Company's products in their area; this will fall more heavily on some authorities than others;
<li>provision of advice to locally based businesses on compliance with all aspects of the food law;
<li>advice to consumers on the opeation and enforcement of official controls and the application of food law;
<li>operation of scheme to provide for the training of food handlers in food hygiene; and
<li>remedial action on infringemnts which fall short of prosecution, including written warnings and the issue of formal cautions (a formal legal proceeding under which the defendent agrees that there has been an infringement of the law and thus the circumstances can be kept on record for the future).
</ul>
<p>
The statistics also exclude:
<ul>
<li>meat hygiene inspections carried out under EC Veterinary Legislation;
<li>milk hygiene inspections of production holdings
<li>inspections carried out by the Wine Standards Board under EC wine legislation
<li>inspections of Marketing(Grading) Standards in the fisheries and horticultural areas;
<li>pesticide residue sampling for which a separate return is required under Driective 90/642;
<li>food surveillance work carried out by Central Government (e.g. radioactive contamination monitoring)
</ul>
<p>
The data were published on four forms (Forms A-D):<br>
<ul>
<li>Form A - Inspection
<li>Form B - Prosecutions
<li>Form C - Official Sampling
<li>Form D - Informal Sampling
</ul>
<br>
Some additional notes are provided by the Ministry to assist in the inerpretation of the data - contact the Ministry Library for details. 

<h3>Comments on the data</h3>

Data from Form A shows that the number of establishments subject to inspection remains at a very consistent level (1995, 616,522; 1994, 617,144; 1993, 617,820).  The number of prosecutions has dropped further and represents only 35% of the number taken in 1992.  The conviction rate has declined to 72% (based on prosecutions), having risen to 90% in 1994, and is the lowest of the 4 years of complete records.  This data is presented graphically in Figure 1.<p>

The use of the improvement notice has also declined further (to 5679) and represents only 14% of the number issued in 1992 (see Figure 2).  The use of written warnings has this year shown a slight drop.

Data from Form B reflects the decline in prosecutions with drops in all the main categories.  The largest drop was for prosecutions relating to extraneous matter where the 1995 figure of 115 represents only 65% of the figure for 1994.  Hygiene prosecutions at 291 now represent only 27% of that reported in 1992 (1087).  The relative proportion of each type of prosecution (based on the total number for 1995) is shown in Figure 3.

Data from Form C shows a slight drop in the number of formal samples (1995, 63,726; 1994, 65,162) taking it to the lowest level of the four years of data available.  Although the number of unsatisfactory samples has again risen (to 21,642), the number of resulting prosecutions has declined further to 323 (from a high of 1056 in 1992).  Overall this represents a prosecution rate of about 1.5%.  The figure depends upon the type of the problem as is indicated in Figure 4.  It will be seen that there are declines in all the categories except for microbioligcal where a slight rise was recorded.

Data from Form D indicates a further slight rise in the level of informal sampling (1995, 183,327; 1994, 181,202).
