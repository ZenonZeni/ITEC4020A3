LETTER FROM THE EDITOR


Dear NewsNet Subscribers:

It seems only fitting that the first Action Letter of the 1990s be a
special issue--and we think it's a very special one indeed.

In less than a month, an all-new version of NewsFlash will be
released.  This issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to these
important enhancements: what does the new NewsFlash mean to you? How
does it work? Why was it designed?  This issue of the Action Letter
was written to help you understand the new NewsFlash, and to put it
to the most effective possible use.  Keep this issue as a reference
tool.

The new NewsFlash has been several years in the making, and was
officially unveiled at the Online '89 trade show, held in Chicago
this past November. The reactions from subscribers who came to the
NewsFlash sneak preview at the Online show were overwhelmingly
positive--and we hope yours will be, too.

The entire NewsNet staff has a had a hand in this project, and we've
worked long and hard to satisfy even the most demanding information
needs. Special thanks must be extended to the following members of
the Software Development team--Adrienne Adler, Lisa Byrne, George
Pickul, Edward Reese, Gary Rosenzweig, Tom Scott, Michael Stein; to
Andrew Elston, NewsNet's Executive Vice President, a wonderful
perfectionist whose quest for the ideal product has brought us (we
hope) pretty close; and to all of NewsNet for their testing help.

We'd also like to thank our beta testers, a dedicated and patient
group who never balked when we extended the test "just one more
week!" Thanks for all your comments and feedback. We couldn't have
done it without you.

And, last but certainly not least, we'd like to thank you, our
subscribers, for your suggestions and input. The design of the new
NewsFlash was based largely on ideas we've received from many of you
over the past several years. Thanks for your support and all your
ideas. We appreciate them all.

Let us know what you think of the new NewsFlash. We're starting work
now on the next phase--even more enhancements to the new NewsFlash!


Sincerely,


Patricia A. McParland
Action Letter Editor

NEWSFLASH: A NEW CLIPPING SERVICE FOR A NEW DECADE

It's official--the new version of NewsFlash is completed and
tested, and we're just about ready to release it.

Starting at the end of January, we will be releasing NewsFlash to
a group of NewsNet subscribers each week. All subscribers will be
converted to the new version by April.

The new NewsFlash incorporates features that you've requested for
years, including the ability to monitor virtually unlimited numbers
of phrases, use of complete Boolean logic to construct your keyword
phrases, and many, many other enhancements. See "Enhanced
NewsFlash... What It Means to You" in this issue for a rundown of
what the new version of NewsFlash has to offer.

Why the Rewrite?

NewsFlash, first released more than six years ago, has been one
of the information industry's premier electronic clipping services
(or, as they are also called, SDI or selective dissemination of
information services).

NewsFlash allowed NewsNet users to monitor up to 10 keyword phrases
for topics of interest to them, 24 hours a day. Any time information
matching the interests of a NewsFlash user was received at NewsNet,
that information would be posted to the subscriber's NewsNet account.

NewsFlash was an instant hit, and quickly became one of the most
popular features used by NewsNet subscribers. With NewsFlash, there
was no need for interactive searching--NewsFlash would monitor all
NewsNet services for your specified keyword phrases, and deliver the
results to you automatically.

Room to Improve

NewsFlash sounds like an almost ideal clipping service, and
in some ways, it was. As with just about anything else, however, there
was room for improvement, and frequent users of NewsFlash began giving
us suggestions on how to enhance the product.

We listened, and in 1987, we began actively soliciting feedback on
how we could best improve NewsFlash. What, specifically, did users
want?  We conducted several extensive telephone surveys, and found
that several suggestions were mentioned especially often:

    1.  The ability to monitor more than 10 phrases.

For anyone seriously involved in competitive intelligence, an
important application of NewsFlash, 10 phrases just isn't enough, our
subscribers told us. In fact, several of the subscribers we spoke
with had more than one NewsNet ID number in order to have more than
10 NewsFlash phrases.

    2.  Keyword phrases should support the use of full searching
        logic.

NewsFlash offered only one logical connector--the + sign, used to
indicate AND. Users wanted to be able to use such connectors as OR
and BUT NOT in their phrases, and to use options allowed in
searching, such as parentheses, string searching, and proximity
searching.

    3.  Users should be able to decide when articles found by
        NewsFlash are delivered.

NewsFlash automatically delivered matching articles (called "hits")
to the user's NewsNet account, and they were displayed automatically
upon signon. There was no way to bypass this notification--you had to
either read, save, or delete your NewsFlash hits before you could
enter the NewsNet database.

We took all of these concerns--and many others mentioned to us by
subscribers over the years--and began design work on a product that
would address them.

Many ideas and work hours later, at the end of last summer, a
vestigial version of the new NewsFlash was ready for testing.  We
rounded up several important industry figures--writers, researchers,
and publishers, to name a few--to help us beat up the new product.
The test period continued through the fall as we isolated and fixed
wrinkles and flaws in the new NewsFlash, aided by the expert
suggestions and opinions of our outside testers.

In early November, the new NewsFlash was officially unveiled for the
first time at the Online '89 conference in Chicago. NewsNet users and
non-subscribers alike attended the special NewsFlash sneak preview,
and the reactions were all we could have hoped for, and then some.
"This is great," one subscriber said. "I've been using five NewsNet
accounts just so I could have more phrases, and now I won't have to.
" Others were especially impressed by the complexity of the phrases
now allowed--up to 256 characters, including the use of full Boolean
logic--and by the fact that hits are delivered only when you want
them.

In This Issue

This issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to the NewsFlash
enhancements, and is designed to help you get acclimated quickly to
the new product.

"Applications of NewsFlash" covers uses for NewsFlash.  "Creating
Folders and Phrases" outlines the rudiments of setting up your
NewsFlash profile, while "Reading Your Hits: A Primer" shows you the
basics of hit retrieval. Keep this issue as you learn to use the new
NewsFlash, and refer to it.  And access the electronic clipping
service of the future--today.

APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW NEWSFLASH


If you've never used NewsFlash before--or if you've used it, but not
often--you may not be aware of the power and flexibility this
electronic clipping utility offers you.

Uses for NewsFlash are as varied as the people who use it--from fast-
food executives to the research department at National Public Radio.
Whether you need industry news or general news, if it's on NewsNet,
NewsFlash can find it for you.

Use NewsFlash to monitor:

    o  Your competition. What are others in your industry up to?
       Is your fiercest rival up for takeover? Will their new
       product offering eclipse yours?

    o  Your own company. What does the press have to say about
       your organization? Are you the subject of corporate
       rumors? Find out now--before it may be too late.

    o  Your trademarks. Is your company name--or the name of one
       of your products--registered? Keep tabs on it to make sure
       no one's making unlawful use of what's rightfully yours.

    o  Your clients. Do you work in a law firm? In public
       relations? Are you a consultant or an editor? For current,
       breaking background information, there's no better source
       than NewsFlash.

    o  Your industry. Track trends, mergers and acquisitions, new
       products and technologies--whatever you need to know.
       Don't search for it. Let NewsFlash search for you.

    o  Your priorities. If it's important to you, let NewsFlash
       track it for you, whether it's your town, your team, your
       alma mater, or your political party.

Need help constructing your NewsFlash keyword phrases? Call our
Customer Service representatives today at 800-345-1301. They'll be
happy to help you design a profile that best suits your needs.

GLOSSARY OF NEWSFLASH TERMS

The following list outlines terminology used in the new NewsFlash.
Keep this list as a guide, and refer to it as you learn to make the
most of the NewsFlash enhancements.

?
Delivers a list of commands valid at that prompt and a brief help
message.

database range
Portion of the database being monitored by a keyword phrase. Database
range may consist of an individual service code, an industry code,
any combination of service and industry codes, or the entire database
(ALL), up to 256 characters.

default
With keyword phrase, folder, or global options, the default is the
standard setting. For the folder option "Display unviewed hits at
signon?," for example, the default setting is YES. If the user does
not choose to modify an option, the default setting will be used.


FLASH
Command used to enter NewsFlash mode, where folders can be created,
deleted, or listed, or options adjusted. The command NewsFlash can
also be used. (Neither command is case-sensitive.)

folder maintenance
Blanket term used to describe the process of establishing and
maintaining folders of keyword phrases. Also called NewsFlash set-up.

folder options
Set of specifications that allows the user to decide how individual
folders--collections of keyword phrases grouped by the user according
to subject matter--will be constructed. Folder options that can be
adjusted by the user include the foldername, the activity status and
activation date, the expiration date, hit sorting requirements, and
hit delivery method for this folder. The user can later any or all of
these options for a particular folder. If no specific options are
requested, the system will default to a standard set of
specifications.

foldername
The name, chosen by the user, that designates the contents of a
specific folder. The foldername can be set or altered at the folder
option level. Foldernames must consist of at least one, but not more
than 44 characters.

global options
Set of specifications that allows the user to decide how NewsFlash hits
will be sorted and delivered in all of a user's folders.  Global options
that can be adjusted by the user include when new hits will be
displayed, when saved hits should be presented, whether hits should be
saved or deleted after viewing, and whether or not the user should be
instantly informed of new hits that arrive during a NewsNet session.
The user may alter any or all of the available options, and may choose
to alter them permanently or only for the current session. If no
specific options are requested, the system will default to a standard
set of specifications.

hit
Term used to describe an individual article found, or "clipped", by
NewsFlash.

instant notification flag
A global option that notifies the user instantly of new NewsFlash
hits. Operative only while the user is actually signed on to
the NewsNet system.

keyword phrase
Word, phrase, or combination of words and phrase the user is monitoring
with NewsFlash. Each entry in a NewsFlash profile is termed a keyword
phrase. If a user were monitoring the entire database for mentions of
Iraq within sixteen words or Iraq, for example, the keyword phrase would
be IRAN W/16 IRAQ. Keyword phrases may consist of up to
256 characters.

line count
Part of both the brief and long headline displays. Shows the number of
lines contained in a particular item clipped by NewsFlash.

NewsFlash
1) NewsNet's SDI (selective dissemination of information) service, also
   called an electronic clipping service. Allows the user to monitor a
   particular service, any combination of services, or the entire
   database for specific terms, called keyword phrases, of interest.
   Monitors the specified service or services (called the database
   range) continously, even while the user is offline.
2) The command used to enter NewsFlash. While equivalent to the
   command FLASH, FLASH is preferable since it is easier
   to remember and shorter to enter.

profile
Same as folder. A collection of keyword phrases grouped together by the
user. A folder or profile may contain as few as one keyword phrase, or
as many as the user desires.

QuickFlash
A NewsFlash command that allows the user to set up folders and keyword
phrase without specifying option (default, or standard, option will be
set automatically). Designed for the new user, the user who wants to use
NewsFlash with a minimum of effort, or the user who is happy
with the current version of NewsFlash.

<RETURN>
A carriage return; also called Enter on some equipment.  Used to send a
line of input to NewsNet. Used by itself on a line in NewsFlash,
<RETURN> moves the user back one prompt at a time, unless it has some
special function at that prompt (if so, it will be mentioned in the
prompt, e.g. /<RETURN>/ for YES).

saved hits
Hits that the user has already seen, but that have been saved for future
retrieval. The user may choose, by altering the global option settings,
when to display saved hits--before new hits, after new hits, or by
request only.

word count
Displayed as part of both brief and long hit displays. Shows the number
of words contained in an individual article clipped by NewsFlash.

READING YOUR NEWSFLASH HITS: A PRIMER


The articles that NewsFlash finds for you--your "hits"--will be
displayed when you sign on, when you sign off, or only when you
request them, according to your global option settings.  Global
options govern how your hits will be organized and delivered
throughout the hit display system.  Use the OPTIONS command in
FLASH to adjust your global option settings.

If you have not changed your global option settings, hits will be
displayed when you sign on.

Regardless of when your NewsFlash hits are actually displayed, you
will receive a brief notification message each time you sign on to the
NewsNet system. This message, which displays the number of saved and
unviewed hits you have waiting, looks like this:

NEWSFLASH NOTIFICATION
======================

Folder FOLDER0001
10 unviewed hits, 12 saved hits


If you have no unviewed or saved hits, a message to this effect
will be displayed.


Reading Your Hits

If your hits are displayed upon signon, as they will be if you
have not adjusted your global options settings, you will be taken
directly into the NewsFlash hit display system immediately after the
NewsFlash notification message is displayed.

If you have more than one folder of keyword phrases, the first prompt
in hit display asks you to enter a foldername.  This prompt looks like
this:

Enter foldername, ALL, LIST (folders), or RENOTIFY
 -->

After you enter a foldername (or immediately after you enter hit
display, if you have only one folder), the main hit display prompt
will be displayed.  This prompt looks like this:

Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve
(saved or deleted hits)
 -->


At this prompt, you can enter:

HEAD to display the headlines of your hits. The order in which
these will be displayed depends upon the global option settings you
have established.  After the headlines are displayed, you can then
choose to display the full text of any that interest you.

TEXT to display the full text of all of your hits, in a
particular folder or for all folders. (Note: To display the full text
of all hits in all folders, you must have entered ALL at the "Enter
foldername" prompt.)

SORT to set temporary sort specifications for your hits.  These
sort settings will remain active in the current folder for the
current NewsFlash session only.

SUMMARY to display a count of saved and unviewed hits in each of
your folders.

ANALYZE to display a service code breakdown of publications in
which hits were found for a particular phrase or phrases.

RETRIEVE to retrieve saved and deleted hits.

Using the HEAD command is explained below.

Displaying Headlines and Text Using the HEAD Command

The most commonly used command to review NewsFlash hits is the
HEAD command. HEAD allows you to review the full text of your
headlines, and then select headlines numbers of which to review full
text.

To review the headlines of your NewsFlash hits, enter HEAD at the
top-level hit display prompt:

Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve
(saved or deleted hits)
 -->HEAD

The order and format in which your hits will be displayed is
determined by your global options settings. If you have not changed
these settings, your hits will be displayed as follows:

Any saved hits you have waiting will be displayed before unviewed
hits (hits you have not seen before).

Headlines will be displayed one screen at a time (approximately
four to five headlines per screen, depending on the length of the
headlines).

Hits will be sorted first by issue date from earliest to latest,
and then within that sort, alphabetically by keyword phrase.

After you enter HEAD and the first group of headlines is
displayed, you will be prompted as follows:

Enter Headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,
Renew (hits); More or <RETURN> for more hits
 -->

Your choices at this prompt are:


To display the full text of one or more headlines, enter the
headline numbers here. To display the full text of all headlines
in this group, enter ALL.

Separate multiple headline numbers with spaces.

PREVIEW to display just the few first lines of articles. After
entering PREVIEW, you will be prompted to enter the headline numbers.

AGAIN to display this group of headlines again.

SAVE to save any or all of the headline numbers displayed. You
can save headlines when you don't have time to display the full text
of them, or when you've displayed them, but want have them be
displayed again the next time you review saved hits. Saved hits are
retained for two days.

DELETE to delete any of the headlines in this group.  You will
then be prompted to enter the number or numbers of the headlines that
you want to delete.

RENEW to return hits to unviewed status. Renewed hits will appear
the next time you display unviewed hits. You are not charged another
clipping charge for renewed hits.

Enter MORE to leave this group of headlines and go to the next
page of headlines. The first group of headlines will be either saved,
deleted, or renewed, according to your global option setting.  The
default setting is DELETE.

Unless you have changed your global option settings, hits will
be deleted after you view them. Note that this default applies only to
unviewed hits, however. Once hits are saved or deleted, they will
retain that status until you specifically request otherwise.

Note that if you enter BACK, QUIT, or STOP at this point in hit
display, any remaining hits will remain unviewed or saved--whatever
they were before you entered hit display.

Pressing <RETURN> at this prompt is identical to entering MORE.


After you have viewed all the available headlines, you will see
a prompt:

Enter headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,
Renew (hits); or <RETURN> to continue
 -->

This prompt is the same as the one displayed after each page of
headlines, except that since there are no more headlines to be
displayed in this group, MORE is not an option. <RETURN> brings you to
the next prompt.

After your saved hits are displayed, you will be notified that
display of this category is complete, and you will then be brought to
the "Enter headline number(s) to read...<RETURN> to continue" prompt.
Press <RETURN>, and the first group of your unviewed hits will be
displayed.

The box below illustrates use of the HEAD command to review
hits.  Note that in this example, the order and format of the hits
have been determined by standard option settings.

You can customize NewsFlash hit display to suit your
specifications.  For more details, call NewsNet Customer Service at
800-345-1301.

SPECIAL HIT DISPLAY COMMANDS FOR ADVANCED USERS


by: George Pickul
    Software Development Programmer

In order to provide a simple, uncluttered environment, the
NewsFlash hit display software contains several "hidden" commands and
a number of special command options.

The "hidden" commands are not included in the list of suggested
commands displayed by typing a ? at any prompt in hit display, simply
because while they offer the flexibility required by the advanced
NewsFlash user, they may confuse novice users.  The special command
options increase the flexibility of several basic NewsFlash commands.

The hidden commands are all based on common NewsFlash commands, but
have an asterisk (*) appended to the end of the command. ALL, for
example, is a valid command at several prompts in NewsFlash; ALL* is a
hidden command with a special meaning.

Three Special Commands

There are three of these special "star" commands: ALL*, HEAD*, and
DELETE*.  These three commands work in a similar way to basic
NewsFlash hit display commands, but act on a larger group of hits.
They were created to aid the downloader and those who have to manage
large groups of NewsFlash hits.

Since each of these three commands is similar to another NewsFlash
command, they have been omitted from the prompts, and cannot be
abbreviated. They are intended specifically for the advanced user who
needs to access NewsFlash hits quickly and efficiently.

ALL*

The ALL* command displays the full text of all hits of the currently
selected type (saved hits, for example, or saved and unviewed hits),
and then changes the status of these hits to deleted. ALL* is
especially useful for those subscribers who want to print or download
the full text of all of their hits, and then quickly delete them.
Since ALL* was designed for downloading, the paging of text is
disabled.

ALL* can be entered at three different prompts in the NewsFlash hit
display system.

If you wish ALL* to operate on all of your folders, enter ALL* at the
"Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt, the
first prompt displayed upon entering the NewsFlash hit display
system. The full text of all of the hits from all of your folders
will be displayed, and then deleted.

ALL* can also be used to operate on all of your folders if you enter
ALL at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY"
prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAD for all
headlines or TEXT for all text."

If you only wish to view the hits from single folder, first specify a
foldername at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders) or
RENOTIFY" prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAd
for headline; Text for full text..."

The order in which hits are displayed, and the type of hits displayed
(saved, unviewed, or deleted), using the ALL* command, are determined
by your global options settings and any sort order changes made using
the SORT command.

ALL* can also be used in conjunction with the RETRIEVE command to
display the full text of all of your saved or deleted hits in a
particular folder.

HEAD*

The HEAD* command acts in a similar manner to that of the ALL*
command, and can be entered at the same prompts.  Instead of
displaying the full text of the hits and then deleting them as ALL*
does, however, HEAD* displays the headlines of all of your hits, and
changes the status of the hits to saved. HEAD* was designed to give
you a quick index of your hits: you can print or download the entire
group of headlines quickly, and then re-enter NewsFlash hit display
later to display full text of selected headlines.

DELETE*

The DELETE* command was created in order to let you qickly delete
large groups of hits. DELETE*, which can be entered at the "Enter
headline number(s) to read, ALL, AGain..." prompt, deletes all of
your remaining hits of the selected type (saved or unviewed), without
your having to delete them page by page or having to display them.
It's equivalent to the command STOP in the former version of
NewsFlash.

Other Command Options

When you access hits from all of your folders, you can bypass the
"Enter HEAD for all headlines or TEXT..." prompt that is displayed
immediately after you specify ALL at the "Enter foldername, List
(existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt. Simply add one of two
special command options to the ALL command: enter ALL -HEAD, or ALL
-TEXT.

ALL -HEAD, entered at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders),
or RENOTIFY" prompt, displays the headlines of hits from all of your
folders. ALL -TEXT, similarly, displays the full text of the hits
afrom all of your folders.

The command HEAD also supports two options: -BRIEF and -DETAIL. When
included on the same line as the HEAD command, the current headline
display format is changed from the setting specified in your global
options to either BRIEF format or DETAILED format.  HEAD is the
command issued to view the headlines of your hits, after you have
specified a foldername or all folders at the "Enter foldername..."
prompt first displayed upon entering hit display, or when using the
RETRIEVE command to view the headlines of saved or deleted hits.

The PAGING command in the new NewsFlash allows the use of four
different command options: -HEAD, -TEXT, -BOTH, -NONE.

The command PAGING, followed by any of these four options, can be
entered at any prompt in NewsFlash. The -TEXT option causes the full
text of NewsFlash hits to be displayed on page at a time. Entering
PAGING -HEAD will cause just headlines to be paged. Both headlines
and full text will be paged if you enter  PAGING -BOTH, and PAGING -
NONE disables paging completely.

For More Details

More details on all of these commands and command options are
available in the updated NewsFlash section of the NewsNet User
Documentation, being mailed to you within the next few weeks, and by
calling NewsNet Customer Service at 800-345-1301 or 215-527-8030.

THE NEWSFLASH CONVERSION PROCESS: WHAT YOU'LL SEE

If you're already a NewsFlash user, you may be wondering if your
existing NewsFlash profile will be compatible with the new NewsFlash
software, and if so, how the conversion will take place.

The new NewsFlash will be released gradually, a group of subscribers
at a time, starting at the end of January.

About a week before your NewsFlash profile is scheduled to be
converted, you will receive a call from a NewsNet representative, who
can answer any questions you may have about the conversion process.
When your profile has been converted, a special message will be
displayed automatically upon signon, letting you know that the new
NewsFlash is now active for you.

Your New Folder

Since the new NewsFlash is based upon groupings of keyword phrases
called "folders," a folder will be placed on your NewsNet account.
This folder, called FOLDER0001, will contain converted versions of
your existing keyword phrases.  All hits from your old NewsFlash
profile will also be transferred to this new folder.

Logical Changes

In the current version of NewsFlash, there is only one logical
connector: the + sign, used between terms to indicate AND. You can
also monitor exact, literal phrases, called "strings", merely by
leaving a space between the terms (INTEREST RATE, for example, would
be searched by the new NewsFlash as an exact phrase).

The new version of NewsFlash supports complete Boolean logic, like
that used with NewsNet's SEARCH command. The connectors AND, OR, and
BUT NOT can now be used, as can proximity searching, parentheses, and
quotation marks to indicate exact, literal phrases ("INTEREST RATE",
for example).

The + sign is no longer operative in the new version of NewsFlash,
and phrases not enclosed in quotation marks will be treated as they
are in SEARCH: as containing an implied AND connector. INTEREST RATE
in the new NewsFlash, for example, will be interpreted as INTEREST AND
RATE.

Your existing phrases will be converted automatically to the new
logical scheme:

    o  All + signs will be removed from your phrases, and
       replaced with the connector AND.

    o  All phrases now used as string searches (INTEREST RATE)
       will be enclosed in quotation marks ("INTEREST RATE").

    o  Any incorrect logical connectors accepted by the old
       NewsFlash (commas, for example) will be removed during the
       conversion.

Check Your Phrases

It is important that you check your phrases to make sure they have
been converted correctly. As soon as you receive the signon
notification letting you know that your NewsFlash profile has been
converted, enter the new NewsFlash set-up system by entering FLASH at
NewsNet's main command prompt (Enter command or <RETURN>).  At the
next prompt, enter LIST -ALL. Your converted profile will be
displayed.

Should you need to make changes to your profile, use the MODIFY
command. Enter FLASH at NewsNet's main command prompt, and, at the
next prompt, enter MODIFY.

After entering MODIFY, you will be prompted to enter OPTIONS or
PHRASES. Enter  PHRASES to change phrases, enter MODIFY at the next
prompt to change phrases, and then follow the prompts through
changing your existing phrases.  Figure 2 illustrates using the
MODIFY command to change existing phrases. [NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE
APPEARS IN THE PRINTED EDITION]

Option Settings

The new NewsFlash system also allows you to set global option
settings, used to customize the way your hits are delivered; folder
option settings, used to determine when monitoring should begin, how
hits should be sorted, and more; and phrase option settings, and
phrase option settings, which include the actual phrase being
monitored, service codes, exclusions, and when the phrase is to
become active.

For converted phrases, standard settings will be established for
your entire group of phrases (FOLDER0001).

Global Options

The standard global options settings created for you by the conversion
process determine that your hits will be delivered in the following
manner:

    o  Unviewed hits (NewsFlash hits that you have not seen
       before) will be displayed automatically when you sign on.

    o  If you have previously viewed your NewsFlash hits and
       saved any of them, all saved hits will be displayed before
       unviewed hits. Saved hits are retained for two days.

    o  After you display unviewed hits, they will be deleted
       unless you specifically request that they be saved or
       renewed (returned to unviewed status).

    o  The headlines of your NewsFlash hits will be paged
       (information will be delivered one screen at a time). Full
       text of any articles you display will not be paged.

Folder Options

    o  Your folder activity status has been set to active, which
       means that your phrases are being actively monitored.

    o  Your hits are sorted first by issue date, earliest to
       latest, and then, within that sort, alphabetically by
       keyword phrase.

    o  Your headlines are shown in brief format, which means that
       approximately four headlines will be displayed per page of
       headlines.

Phrase Options

    o  Services cross-referenced to the services you are
       monitoring with NewsFlash will automatically be included.

    o  If you are currently monitoring ALL services,
       cross-referencing will be set to NOT APPLICABLE.

    o  The maximum number of hits you will receive from a phrase
       each day is 50.

To Change These Options

Any or all of these option settings can be adjusted to your
specifications.

To change your global option settings, enter FLASH at NewsNet's main
command prompt (Enter command or <RETURN>), and then at the next
prompt, enter OPTIONS. You will be prompted through changing.

To change your folder option settings, enter FLASH at NewsNet's main
command prompt, and when prompted to enter "CReate, Modify, Delete,
Undelete...", enter MODIFY. The next prompt will ask you to enter
OPTIONS or PHRASES.  To change folder options, enter  OPTIONS, and
follow the prompts through changing.

To change your phrase option settings, enter FLASHat NewsNet's main
command prompt, and, at the next prompt, enter MODIFY. When prompted
to enter OPTIONS or PHRASES, enter  PHRASES.  The next prompt asks
you to specify whether you would like to add, modify, delete,
undelete, or list phrases; enter MODIFY, and then follow the prompts
through changing your phrase option settings.
