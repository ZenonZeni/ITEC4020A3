<IMG SRC="blueline.gif" Alt = "--------------------------------------/------------------------------------"><br><A NAME="history"><H2>History</H2></A>

The Fitzroy Legal Service opened in December 1972.  It was one
of the first services of its kind in Australia.  At that time
the main formal sources of legal aid were:
<UL>
<LI>The Legal Aid Committee (which then had only a city office).
 The Committee handled mainly civil cases plus criminal cases
at a Magistrates' Court level.  It appointed private solicitors
(who were paid 80% of normal fees).  Clients were usually required
to pay a contribution, often by instalments.  A &quot;charge&quot;
 over property was often required; and
<LI>The Public Solicitor who assisted persons in criminal matters
in the County and Supreme Courts.
</UL>

<br>
Subsequently in 1973 the Australian Legal Aid Office opened. 
Its aims were to (a) assist those who have a problem involving
a Federal law; and (b) assist pensioners, people receiving Social
Security Benefits, migrants, Aborigines, ex-servicemen and some
students.
<br>
In December 1978 an Act of Parliament was passed allowing for
the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission in Victoria.  Such
a Commission was intended to be an independent corporation determining
policy and funding levels for all legal aid organisations in Victoria
except the Aboriginal Legal Service.  The Commission was fully
operational by the end of 1980.<P>

<A NAME="constitution"><H3>Constitution</H3></A>

The Fitzroy Legal Service is an independent organisation governed
by its members through 4 General Meetings per year. Members of
the community and clients are encouraged to participate.  Funding
is received from the Australian Government Attorney-General's
Department via the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria.  Contributions
for its operations have also been received in the past from catchment
area councils, and more recently from various government departments
and Trusts for specific projects.  The FLS is not an instrument
of government or municipal bodies.<P>

<A NAME="objectives"><H3>Legal Service Objectives</H3></A>

The Service's objectives are -

<UL>
<LI>to provide a free and readily accessible legal service to people in necessitous circumstances and who qualify under the Service's eligibility criteria, and who live, work or study in the catchment area and to such other persons as the Service may from
 time to time decide;
<LI>to seek guidance and direction on policy and its development from the community;
<LI>to involve local citizens in the recognition, understanding and solution of their own legal and related problems;
<LI>to establish programmes of preventative law;
<LI>to provide legal education in the community; and
<LI>to initiate and participate in law reform programs.

</UL>
and in implementing such goals priority be given to -
<uL>
<li>innovative service delivery; and

<LI>analysis and criticism of government, the legal profession
and social structure.
</uL><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="top.gif" align = "right" ALT="Top of Document" Border = 0></A>

<IMG SRC="blueline.gif" alt = "--------------------------------------/------------------------------------"><br>
<H2><a name="operation">Operation</A></H2>




In endeavouring to provide an accessible legal service to people
without means the Service is -
<uL>
<LI>free;
<LI>a storefront location in the suburbs where people live;
<LI>operates at night so that those who cannot take time off work can consult us;
<LI>informal, in that we seek to avoid an inhibiting atmosphere by taking a more personal and human approach; and
<LI>holistic in its approach to people and their problems, by not focusing solely on legal solutions.
</uL>

<br>
The legal service also participates in and promotes law reform
as well as promoting community legal education which is closely
bound up with the practice of preventative law, demystification
and empowerment.<P>


Clients are seen from 6.30pm to 9.00pm Monday to Friday - at which
time no appointment is necessary.  Legal advice<STRONG> IS NOT GIVEN OVER
THE TELEPHONE</STRONG>.  However, assistance is often given by telephone
to social workers and people in other helping agencies (including
many government officers who seek advice on behalf of their clients).
 During the day the casework solicitors only see clients by appointment
(usually after they have been seen at night).  However, emergency
situations are handled wherever possible.  
<P>
<A NAME="client volume"><H3>Client Volume</H3></A>

Since opening in 1972, the Fitzroy Legal Service has seen over
50,000 different people.  New clients are seen at the rate of
approximately 80 per week.  Total interviews, including people
who call a second or third time, amount to substantially more
than the number of client files opened. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="client groups">Client Groups</A></H3>

Strict geographical limitations were introduced in November 1978
in order to try and manage the workload.  People who live outside
the inner suburban area are encouraged to see a legal service
closer to their local area. Referrals are made where possible.
 There are now over 40 odd Community Legal Centres in Victoria,
including specialist Centres.  
<br>
A large proportion of legal service clients live in rented premises
or are boarders.  Approximately 40% of the catchment area population
consists of persons from non-English speaking backgrounds.  A
substantial proportion are unemployed or receiving pensions or
benefits and make up the overwhelming proportion of service users.
 
<P><A NAME="interpreters"><H3>Interpreters</H3></A>

Wherever possible Fitzroy Legal Service tries to arrange for volunteer
interpreters in numerous community languages, to be available
on particular nights.  Failing this, use is made of the free emergency
Telephone Interpreter Service, or if a specific grant has been
received from the Legal Aid Commission arrangements can be made
for an interpreter to attend.  
<br>
Community Legal Centres do not have access tothe Legal Interpreting
Service which creates great difficulties for a large proportion
of agency users who come from non-English speaking backgrounds.

<A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="top.gif" align = "right" ALT="Top of Document" Border = 0></A>

<IMG SRC="blueline.gif" Alt = "--------------------------------------/------------------------------------"><br> <H2><a NAME="problems">Types of Problems</A></H2>

The main areas in which assistance is sought are in criminal matters,
family law, motor vehicle accidents, consumer problems, debts,
housing, employment and miscellaneous areas including wills, immigration,
social security payments, as well as complaints against police,
solicitors, governments, etc. <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="top.gif" align = "right" ALT="Top of Document" Border = 0></A>

<IMG SRC="blueline.gif" Alt = "--------------------------------------/------------------------------------"><br>
<A NAME="casework services"><H2>Casework Services</H2></A>

In a majority of cases we take some form of action such as writing
letters, making investigations, using the telephone to negotiate
and make demands.  We also prepare documents and take other action
which includes completing forms and applications, attending police
stations or other premises.  Representation in court can be organised
if the client cannot genuinely afford legal costs and there are
no avenues of assistance open.   Court proceedings are issued
or defended in appropriate cases.  These include cases where particular
injustices or hardships would otherwise result and where other
avenues of legal aid will not assist.  
<br>
In many cases the Service refers clients to private solicitors,
appropriate social welfare agencies and/or the Legal Aid Commission.
 Representation is also arranged for clients in a range of Tribunals<P>
<A NAME="means test"><H3>Means Test</H3></A>

No formal means test is applied.  Where representation in court
is sought the decision is made on the basis of client need.  In
many cases advice is given to people who would not normally qualify
for legal aid on the grounds that it seems quite wrong for someone
to pay to find out information.<A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="top.gif" align = "right" ALT="Top of Document" Border = 0></A>

<IMG SRC="blueline.gif" Alt = "--------------------------------------/------------------------------------"><br>
<A NAME="law reform &comm ed"><H2>Law Reform and Community Legal Education</H2></A>

The Fitzroy Legal Service engages in a broad range of activities
related to community legal education, law reform and general issues
regarding legal aid.
<UL>
<LI>One of its major projects has been the annual production and
publishing of  <STRONG><a href="flspubs.htm#FLS.00">The Law Handbook</a></STRONG> - a 780page book setting
out areas of law commonly encountered at the Legal Service.  The
book has a practical orientation and uses relatively simple language.
 The publication was first published in the format of a loose
leaf binder entitled &quot;The Legal Resources Book&quot; which
was first released in 1977 and now is in a bound book format entitled
&quot;The Law Handbook&quot;, which was first released in 1987
and is updated and distributed on an annual basis. <I>(See On-line
Catalogue)</I>
<LI>Legal Service staff are involved in writing submissions and
speaking at a range of venues.  The Legal Service has been involved
in committees engaged in work on consumer credit, housing associations,
welfare rights, community legal education, Children's Court, multilingual
pamphlets, the Beach Inquiry, Cost of Justice Inquiry, the National
Legal Aid Advisory Committee, numerous Federation of Victorian
Community Legal Centres Work Groups and many other community based
organisations.  
<LI>Media activity has been considerable over the years, the principle
endeavour being to improve the knowledge about the functioning
of the law and seeking law reform.  The Legal Service Bulletin
(now called The Alternative Law Journal) which was an early project
of FLS is now a self-supporting national periodical which deals
with legal aid and related issues. Legal Service staff appear
regularly on radio.
<LI>The frequent role of the FLS in the early days was in advising
and supporting others wishing to establish legal services not
only in Victoria but also interstate.  In addition to individual
clients the Fitzroy Legal Service advises community, ethnic and
similar organisations. 
<LI>The Legal Service has also been involved in a number of innovative
programs which include outreach law programs at the neighbourhood
level within the catchment area which endeavour to deal with casework
law, community legal education and social action, and working
on issues affecting a given neighbourhood.  <U>Alphaline</U> -
<U>a 24 hour emergency free legal advice line for young people
in trouble with the police</U>, and publications such as <U>Where
You Stand</U> - a life rights publication for young people, <U>The
Where You Stand Teachers Kit</U>, <U>The Activists Rights Handbook</U>,
<U>Legal Aid One Law for You, Another For Me,</U> <U>The Report
into Mistreatment by Police in 1991-2,</U> and until recently
the <U>Youth Advocates Guide</U> and the <U>Drug and Alcohol Users
Guide</U> - a guide to detoxification and rehabilitation agencies
in Victoria for which we have lost funding, are also published
by the Legal Service.
<LI>The Fitzroy Legal Service also conducts and assists in the
conduct of research into aspects of legal aid and welfare generally.
 Extensive statistical information has been collected in the past
in an endeavour to increase knowledge of client needs.  The FLS
continues to maintain client statistics which are generally taken
by the lawyer during the course of the interview, and are an important
lobbying tool for legal centres in general.

<A NAME="staff"><H2>Staff</H2></A>
<br>
There are currently approximately 150 volunteers contributing
to the operations of the FLS, through various committees, workgroups
and by staffing the evening service.  There are approximately
60 lawyers (barristers and solicitors) and non-legal volunteers
on a roster who attend one evening every week.  Non-lawyers interview
clients in conjunction with a lawyer with a view to assisting
communication, ensuring that a minimum of unintelligible legal
jargon is used and to add advice from their own experience.  
<br>
Day staff currently consists of -

<IMG SRC="blueline.gif" Alt = "--------------------------------------/------------------------------------"><br><A NAME="philosophy"><H2>The Fitzroy Legal Service PHILOSOPHY</H2></A>
<UL>
<LI>People have potential and they can develop greater power and
control over their own lives.
<LI>The Legal Service should operate as a medium of <U>change</U>
by improving people's level of knowledge and their ability to
cope, by changing laws and by raising the level of enforceability
of rights.
<LI>The Legal Service should give people access to the law.
</UL>


The positive expression of this philosophy can be made evident
in the attitudes and conduct of members by:
<UL>
<LI>Breaking down the mystique of the law and the formality of
the solicitor/client relationship through a personal approach.
<LI>Making a conscious effort to communicate with clients in a
way they can understand.
<LI>Seeking wherever possible to do more than advise and refer.
 This involves not only taking appropriate action but also looking
beyond the immediate problem with a view to:



<UL>
<LI>ascertain the causes;

<LI> prevent future problems of that nature;

<LI> being aware of and using the resources of the community;

<LI> giving accurate and competent advice; and

<LI>accepting responsibility towards clients and fellow workers
by attending promptly and regularly.
