<h2>Light and the Sun</h2>

<p><font size=+2>T</font>he sun's energy is vital to life on Earth.  It determines the Earth's surface temperature and
supplies virtually all the energy that drives natural global systems and cycles.  Although some
other stars are enormous sources of energy in the form of X-rays and radio signals, our sun
releases 95% of its energy as visible light.  Yet, visible light represents only a fraction of the total
radiation spectrum; infrared and ultraviolet rays are also significant parts of the solar spectrum.

<p><img border=0 align=left hspace=15 vpsace=3 src="images/spectrum.gif">
<font color="#F79D00">The sun emits virtually all of its radiation energy in a spectrum
of wavelengths that range from about 2x10<sup>-7</sup> to 4x10<sup>-6</sup> m. The majority of this energy is in
the visible region.  Each wavelength corresponds to a frequency and an energy; the shorter the
wavelength, the higher the frequency and the greater the energy (expressed in eV, or electron
volts).</font>

<p>Each portion of the solar spectrum is associated with a different level of energy.  Within the
visible portion of the spectrum, for example, red light is at the low-energy end and violet light is
at the high-energy end (having half again as much energy as red light).  In the invisible portions
of the spectrum, photons in the ultraviolet region, which cause the skin to tan, have more energy
than those in the visible region.  Likewise, photons in the infrared region, which we feel as heat,
have less energy than the photons in the visible region.
