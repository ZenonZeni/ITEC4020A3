<td><font size=+2><p align=center><b>Cocos Diving</b></font>

<p><font size=+1>While diving Cocos Island is extraordinary and beautiful, the Cocos Island area is very remote.  It is not recommended for inexperienced divers because it is an open ocean destination that requires advanced open water diving skills.

<p>Every dive at Cocos is distinct.  Currents and visibility can be entirely different in just a few hours.  The diving among the rocky islets off the coast of the main island is very exciting.  The primary attraction are large pelagics, i.e., sharks, whales, rays, mantas, turtles and schooling fish.  Sightings of sailfish, marlin, bottlenose dolphins and whale sharks are often reported.  The bottom is volcanic rock, with prolific long-spine sea urchins.  Most of the action is at 60-80 feet but a dive computer is recommended as you will want the capability to go to 100 feet.  A safe limit of 110 feet is requested.  Visibility averages 80-100 feet.

<p>Diving will commence shortly after your arrival at Cocos Island.  There are three dives daily from one of the fiberglass skiffs.  You may choose your diving buddy or join the group which is guided by our dive master.

<p><b>Water Termperature:</b><br>
You will be diving in water about 78-83 F.

<p><b>Visibility:</b><br>
Visiblity averages 80-100' with ocassional extremes of 40 and 120'.


<p><b>Certification Cards:</b><br>
All divers must bring proof of certification by a national certifying agency.  The dive master will request to see your certification before you are allowed to dive.

<p><b>Dive Gear Suggestions:</b><br>
You will need the following gear:
1/8" to 3/16" wet suit, mask, fins, snorkel, regulator with visible pressure gauge, dive computer, buoyancy compensator, depth gauge, dive gloves, weight belt (without weights), dive knife and dive watch.  It is recommended that you mark each piece of gear with waterproof paint or tape.  We suggest you put all or most of the above items in a carry-on bag.

<p>There is ample storage space for your diving equipment, including your own personal locker.  We provide you with 80 cubic ft. tanks and weights.

<p><b>Underwater Photography:</b><br>
The diving around Cocos Island offers some of the most photogenic waters in the world.  Photographers will find reefs, fish life and visibility excellent for both stills and videos.
