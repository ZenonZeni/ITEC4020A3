The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) is the trade association for more than a hundred companies in Britain producing prescription medicines.  Its member companies research, develop, manufacture and supply more than 90 per cent of the medicines prescribed through the National Health Service (NHS).

<li>to develop and promote the UK as an attractive R&D and manufacturing environment to encourage innovation;
<li>to ensure that the industry is recognised as an integral partner in the provision of healthcare.<br>
</ul>

<p>

These objectives will be achieved by:<br>

<ul>
<li>acting as the leading body in representing the industry view to governments and decision makers;<br>
<li>defining, prioritising and managing, on behalf of and with the participation of its membership, issues of strategic importance to the industry;<br>
