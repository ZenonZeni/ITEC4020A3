<P>
<A HREF="specfree.htm">Freedom Capital Management Corporation</A>
 is a Tucker Anthony affiliate and Boston-based investment advisory
firm founded in 1930 that manages in excess of $4.5 billion in assets.
Although investment managers are usually known for their expertise
in either one of two particular styles of stock selection, 	<A HREF="stocktyp.htm#stockgro">Growth
Stocks</A> or <A HREF="stocktyp.htm#stockval">Value Stocks</A>, Freedom uniquely
blends both styles into its investment philosophy.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=433 HEIGHT=353 SRC="images/tachsty.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
As the chart above demonstrates, history reveals
that market preference for growth versus value stocks tends to
alternate in cycles. For example, when growth stocks are leading,
or in favor, value stocks are lagging, or out of favor, and vice
versa.

<P>
Freedom's experience and knowledge gathered
through its long and extensive use of both styles over the years
has led them to develop an advanced and disciplined approach to
combining both styles to advantage in single dual focus portfolios.
By combining both styles, investors gain access to a portfolio
weighted more heavily in the type of stocks that are believed
to present greater opportunities at the time. Freedom believes
that its dual expertise and its experience in managing portfolios
of stocks with both styles offers clients greater long-term capital
appreciation while reducing the overall volatility of the portfolio.
As a result, Freedom now offers both individual and institutional
clients two advisory programs featuring this unique dual style,
dual strategy growth + value portfolios.

<P>
<B><I>Focus Growth + Value Portfolios</B></I>

<P>
Freedom believes in offering the best of
both world's to smaller managed accounts -- enhanced performance
and reduced downside risk. Each <I>Focus</I> <I>Portfolio</I>
is tailored to reflect specific investor goals and risk/reward
profiles. The portfolios are actively managed to meet the unique
circumstances and objectives of each client. Through this program,
a minimum investment of $100,000 is required.

<P>
<I><B>Privately Managed Accounts</B></I>
<P>
Freedom also offers the combined Growth + Value
portfolio to private investors and smaller institutions who require
special handling and a higher level of service. A minimum investment
of $500,000 is required.

<P>

Freedom's <I>Focus Growth + Value Portfolios </I>or <I>Privately

<I><B><FONT  SIZE=+2>FundManager Program</FONT></B></I>

<P>
The <I>FundManager Program </I>is a fee-based
advisory program that designs a custom portfolio of mutual funds
to suit each investor's needs. With a $50,000 minimum initial
investment, a broad range of investors may now have
the opportunity to have their portfolio managed by Michael Hirsch,
a recognized expert in mutual fund investing.

<P>
Over 20 years ago, Michael D. Hirsch of
	<A HREF="specfree.htm">Freedom Capital Management Corporation</A>, an affiliate
of Tucker Anthony, developed the concept of multi-fund investing
-- investing and strategically allocating all of a client's assets
in mutual funds. Today, Michael Hirsch and Freedom Capital have
created an investment advisory program using this &quot;multi-fund&quot;
concept called the <I>FundManager Program</I>. Simply stated,
the <I>FundManager Program</I> combines carefully selected mutual
funds to build a cohesive portfolio that seeks to achieve what
every smart investor strives for: consistent, above-average returns
over market cycles with reduced risk and maximum safety. This
disciplined multi-fund investing approach is a unique investment
concept that harnesses the experience and expertise of those Michael
Hirsch believes are the nation's most talented mutual fund managers
for your portfolio.
