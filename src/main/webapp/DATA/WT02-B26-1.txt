<H2>Fact Sheet:  Insurance and Income </H2>
 
<H4>Copyright 1995 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill </H4>
 <HR>
The following information was taken from the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of 
Representatives' "Overview of Entitlement Programs, 1994 Green Book: Background Material and Data 
on Programs within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means," U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C., 1994 
 <P>
What is the Disability Insurance Program? 
 <P>
The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly cash benefits for disabled workers under age 65 
and their dependents.  Benefits were provided to disabled workers age 50 or older by the 1956 Social 
Security amendments; benefits for their dependents were provided by the 1958 Social Security 
amendments; and benefits to disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments. 
 <P>
In 1993, there were 5.2 million persons in current payment status.  Twenty-six percent were disabled by 
reason of mental illness.   
 <P>
Many provisions of the DI program are identical to those of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), 
commonly referred to as Social Security.  The purpose of both OASI and DI benefits is to replace income 
lost when the wage-earner is no longer able to work.  The DI program insures against the loss of income 
due to the worker's physical or mental disability. 
 <P>
What is the definition of disability? 
 <P>
Generally, disability is defined as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a 
physical or mental impairment.  The impairment must be medically determinable and expected to last for 
not less than 12 months or to result in death.  
 <P>
Claimants may be determined to be disabled only if, due to such an impairment, they are unable to engage 
in any kind of substantial gainful work, considering their age, education, and work experience, which 
exists in the national economy.  The work need not exist in the immediate area in which the claimant 
lives, nor must a specific job vacancy exist for the individual.  Moreover, no showing is required that the 
worker would be hired for the job if he or she applied. 
 <P>
What are the DI benefits? 
 <P>
In general, DI monthly cash benefits are paid and computed on the same basis as in the OASI program.  
Benefit amounts are related to the past earning of the insured worker.  Medicare is provided to disabled 
workers, widow(er)s, or adult children after they have been entitled to disability benefits for 24 months.  
In December 1993 there were 5.2 million DI beneficiaries in current-payment status.  The total monthly 
benefits paid out were $2.6 billion.  Table 1 summarizes various types of beneficiaries of the DI program 
currently receiving benefits, average benefit amounts, and the number of new awards during 1993. 
 <P>
What are the major benefit types relevant to persons with mental illness? 
 <P>
The major benefit types include: 
 <P>
1.  Disabled-worker benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to  a disabled worker under age 65 insured for 
disability. 
 <P>
2.  Disabled adult child's benefit --  A monthly benefit payable  to a disabled person aged 18 or over--a son 
or daughter or eligible grandson or granddaughter of a retired, deceased, or disabled worker--whose 
disability began before age 22. 
 <P>
What is Supplemental Security Income? 
 <P>
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a means-tested, federally administered income 
assistance program authorized by title XVI of the Social Security Act.  Begun in 1974, SSI provides 
monthly cash payments in accordance with uniform, nationwide eligibility requirements to needy aged, 
blind, and disabled persons.  In 1993, nearly six million persons were receiving SSI.  Of these, 1,471,000 
(or 28.1 percent) were disabled by a mental disorder other than retardation. 
 <P>
What has been the trend in SSI recipients? 
 <P>
The number of recipients on SSI has risen from nearly 4 million in 1974 to nearly 6 million in December 
1993.  From 1984 through 1993, the disabled population on SSI grew at an annual average rate of about 
9.2 percent.  The monthly federal benefit rates for individuals and couples rose from $140 and $210 in 
1974 to $446 and $669 in 1994, respectively. 
 <P>
The proportion of SSI recipients receiving Social Security benefits declined from nearly 53 percent in 
1974 to about 40 percent in 1993.  The fraction of SSI recipients receiving some other type of unearned 
income rose from about 11 percent in 1974 to 13 percent in 1993, and the fraction with earnings jumped 
from about 3 percent to 1974 to more than 4 percent in December 1993. 
 <P>
What about children and SSI payments? 
 <P>
In June 1993, 732,000 blind and disabled children were eligible for SSI payments.  These children made 
up 12.6 percent of the over 5.8 million SSI recipients in June, and they represent a fast-growing segment 
of the SSI population.  
 <P>
To be eligible for SSI payments as a child, an individual must be under age 18 (or under 22 if he or she is 
a full-time student, unmarried, and must meet the SSI disability, citizenship/residency, and income and 
resources criteria (applicable to adults).  The Zabley Supreme Court decision required "individual 
functional assessments for children, not just conformity to one diagnosis in the adult listings. 
 <P>
In June 1993, almost 61 percent of the SSI children were 12 years old or less, and an estimated 20 percent 
of the children were under age 6.  About 28 percent (or about 199,000) were between the ages of 13 and 
17. 
 <P>
More than half (61 percent) of the SSI children were medically eligible based on a mental disorder, and 
most of these (43 percent) were mentally retarded.  The remaining 18 percent (61 minus 43)--or 131,760--
are eligible based on mental disorders other than retardation.
