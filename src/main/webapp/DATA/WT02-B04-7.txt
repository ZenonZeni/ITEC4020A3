                        QUESTIONS PRESENTED
     1.  Whether the federal criminal prohibition against the use
of a &quot;telecommunications device&quot; to &quot;knowingly * * * make[],
create[], or solicit[], and * * * initiate[] the transmission of&quot;
any material &quot;which is * * * indecent, knowing that the recipient
of the communication is under 18 years of age,&quot; 47 U.S.C.
223(a)(1)(B), is unconstitutional on its face.
     2.  Whether the federal criminal prohibition against
&quot;knowingly&quot; using an &quot;interactive computer service&quot; to send to &quot;a
specific person or persons under 18 years of age,&quot; any material
&quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently

                     BRIEF FOR THE APPELLANTS
                       _____________________
                          OPINIONS BELOW
     The opinion of the three-judge district court (J.S. App. 1a-
147a) is reported at 929 F. Supp. 824.
                           JURISDICTION
     The judgment of the district court was entered on June 11,
1996.  A notice of appeal was filed on July 1, 1996.  J.S. App.
162a-164a.  On August 19, 1996, Justice Souter extended the time
for filing a jurisdictional statement to and including September
29, 1996; the jurisdictional statement was filed on September 30,
1996 (a Monday).  This Court noted probable jurisdiction on
December 6, 1996.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on Section
561(b) of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), Pub. L. No.
104-104, 110 Stat. 143, and 28 U.S.C. 1253.
         CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED
     The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
provides that &quot;Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the
freedom of speech.&quot;  The Fifth Amendment provides that no person
shall be deprived of * * * liberty * * * without due process of
law.&quot;  Section 502 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Pub.
L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 133, appears in the appendix to the
jurisdictional statement.  J.S. App. 165a-172a.
                             STATEMENT
     This case involves a constitutional challenge to provisions of
the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) that forbid the use of
&quot;telecommunications device[s]&quot; and &quot;interactive computer
service[s]&quot; to disseminate &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot;
sexually explicit material to children under 18 years of age.  Pub.
L. No. 104-104, _ 502, 110 Stat. 133 (1996) (to be codified at 47
U.S.C. 223(a)(1)(B), (a)(2), and (d)).[1]  Those prohibitions apply
to the dissemination of material on the system of interlinked
computers known as the Internet.  Appellees, organizations and
individuals who use the Internet, filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging
that the CDA's restrictions on the dissemination of sexually
explicit material violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the
Constitution.  A three-judge district court held the CDA's
restrictions unconstitutional on their face and issued a
preliminary injunction against their enforcement.  All three judges
concluded that the restrictions violate the First Amendment right
of adults to disseminate sexually explicit material to other
adults.  Two of the three judges concluded that the CDA's
restrictions are also unconstitutionally vague.
     1.  The Internet is generally regarded as having originated
from experimental efforts of the Department of Defense to link
defense-related computer systems so that research and communication
could continue even if portions of the network were damaged.  J.S.
App. 14a.  Similar networks were subsequently developed to link
universities, research facilities, businesses, and individuals
around the world.  Id. at 16a.  All of those networks were
ultimately linked to one another, and became a global network known
as the Internet.  Ibid.
     Individuals obtain access to the Internet in two basic ways:
Some use a personal computer with a modem to connect over a
telephone line to a computer network that is linked to the
Internet; others use a computer that is directly connected to a
network linked to the Internet.  J.S. App. 16a-17a.  Many entities
offer modem or direct connections to the Internet.  For example,
national on-line commercial services, such as America Online, and
commercial &quot;Internet service providers&quot; charge subscribers a
monthly or hourly fee for access to the Internet through their own
computer networks.  Id. at 19a.  Educational institutions often
provide Internet access to students, faculty and researchers
through computers located on campus.  Id. at 17a.  Some businesses
provide such access to their employees through their office
computers.  Id. at 17a-18a.  As many as 40 million people use the
Internet today, and that figure is expected to grow to 200 million
by 1999.  Id. at 13a.
     There are many ways for people to communicate on the Internet,
either to one or several specific individuals or more broadly.  One
way is through electronic mail (e-mail).  Using e-mail, an
individual can send an electronic message to one or more specific
persons.  J.S. App. 21a.  People can also use automatic mailing
list services (mail exploders) to send messages that are
automatically distributed via e-mail to those who have subscribed
to the mailing list.  Id. at 22a.  Information can also be
exchanged through newsgroups.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Like mail
exploders, newsgroups involve discussions on specific topics.
Those who use newsgroups, however, do not have to subscribe in
advance; instead, messages are temporarily stored on the system,
and users can obtain access to them until they are purged.  Id. at
23a.  Persons can also use the Internet to communicate in &quot;real
time.&quot;  Programs such as &quot;talk&quot; permit one-to-one communication;
programs such as &quot;Internet Relay Chat&quot; permit communication among
several persons.  Id. at 24a.
     Another way to use the Internet is to search for and retrieve
information that is stored on remote computers.  J.S. App. 25a.
The most well-known method of doing that is by exploring the &quot;World
Wide Web.&quot;  Id. at 25a-26a.  The Web utilizes a formatting language
known as hypertext markup language (HTML).  Software programs known
as &quot;Web browsers&quot; can display HTML documents containing text,
images, and sound.  Ibid.  HTML also permits documents to include
&quot;links&quot; to other Internet documents, so that with a click of a
computer &quot;mouse,&quot; a person can move from one document to another
even if the documents are stored on computers in different parts of
the world.  Ibid.  Many organizations have &quot;home pages&quot; on the Web
that store information about the organization and its activities
and that provide links to other Web sites containing related
information.  Id. at 27a.  For example, the Department of Justice
maintains a home page on the Web at http://www.usdoj.gov.  By
typing that Internet address into a Web browser, a user could reach
a computer containing information about the activities and
operations of the Department of Justice.
     &quot;[S]earch engines&quot; allow persons to search for information on
a particular topic by typing &quot;key words.&quot;  J.S. App. 30a.  For
example, &quot;a Web user looking for the text of Supreme Court opinions
would type the words 'Supreme Court' into a search engine, and then
be presented with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain
Supreme Court information.&quot;  Ibid.  The user could thereafter
&quot;brows[e] through the information on each site, until the desired
material is found.&quot;  Ibid.
     There is a wide range of information available through the
Internet.  Commercial enterprises maintain Web sites to inform
potential customers about their goods and services and to solicit
purchases.  J.S. App. 43a.  Nonprofit organizations make
information available on topics of interest to them.  Id. at 44a.
Some libraries have placed their card catalogs online.  Id. at 42a.
Chat rooms and newsgroups provide forums for the discussion of
different topics, from Formula 1 racing cars to the Oklahoma City
bombing.  Id. at 42a-43a, 47a-48a.  Information that is available
on the Internet &quot;is as diverse as human thought.&quot;  Id. at 43a.
Sexually explicit material also exists on the Internet, extending
&quot;from the modestly titillating to the hardest-core.&quot; Id. at 47.
&quot;Purveyors of such material take advantage of the same ease of
access available to all users of the Internet.&quot;  Ibid.
     2.  When it enacted the CDA, Congress found that the Internet
and other interactive computer services &quot;represent an extraordinary
advance in the availability of educational and informational
resources,&quot; 47 U.S.C. 230(a)(1), as well as &quot;a forum for a true
diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural
development, and myriad avenues of intellectual activity,&quot;  47
U.S.C. 230(a)(3).  At the same time, Congress recognized that &quot;some
of the information traveling over the Internet is tasteless,
offensive, and downright spine-tingling.&quot;  141 Cong. Rec. S8345
(daily ed. June 14, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Biden).  Congress was
concerned that, without &quot;some basic rules of the road,&quot; the
availability and easy accessibility of sexually explicit materials
through the Internet would harm children.  141 Cong. Rec. S8087
(daily ed. June 9, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Exon).  See 141 Cong.
Rec. S8473 (daily ed. June 15, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Robb).  As
Senator Exon stated, &quot;[t]he computer is a wonderful device for
arranging, storing, and making it relatively easy for anyone to
call up information or pictures on any subject they want.  That is
part of the beauty of the Internet system.&quot;  141 Cong. Rec. S8089
(daily ed. June 9, 1995).  That same technology, however, allows
sexually explicit materials, including &quot;the worst, most vile, [and]
most perverse pornography,&quot; to be &quot;only a few click-click-clicks
away from any child.&quot;  Id. at S8088.  See also 141 Cong. Rec. H8293
(daily ed. Aug. 2, 1995) (remarks of Rep. Hyde).  Congress sought
to ensure that the &quot;brave new world&quot; of interactive computer
services would not be &quot;hostile to the innocence of our children.&quot;
Id. at S8333-S8334 (remarks of Sen. Coats).
     Congress learned that commercial pornographers had seized upon
the Internet as a profitable source of business.  It found that
commercial pornographers put &quot;the best and most enticing pictures
of whatever they want to sell&quot; on the Internet as &quot;teasers,&quot; and
those pictures may be viewed &quot;without charge&quot; by &quot;very young
children&quot; and &quot;anyone else who wants to see them.&quot;  141 Cong. Rec.
S8090 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Exon).  Congress
found that the only barriers between children and such material
were &quot;perfunctory onscreen warnings which inform minors they are on
their honor not to look at this,&quot; which is &quot;like taking a porn shop
and putting it in the bedroom of your children and then saying 'Do
not look.'&quot;  141 Cong. Rec. S8332-S8333 (daily ed. June 14, 1995)
(remarks of Sen. Coats).
     Congress also found that pornography on the Internet was
particularly accessible to children, because children have become
&quot;the computer experts in our Nation's families.&quot;  141 Cong. Rec.
S8332 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Coats); see also
id. at S8344 (remarks of Sen. Exon).  As one of the CDA's most
vocal legislative opponents stated, even &quot;[v]ery young children are
so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of
a computer screen at home or at school and connect to the outside
world through the Internet or some other on-line service.&quot; Id. at
S8341 (remarks of Sen. Leahy).  One study presented to Congress
estimated that &quot;[o]f the 6.8 million homes with on-line accounts
currently available, 35 percent have children under the age of 18.&quot;
Id. at S8333-S8334 (remarks of Sen. Coats).
     Congress also learned that the easy accessibility of
pornographic material on the Internet was deterring its use by
parents who did not wish to risk exposing their children to such
material.  141 Cong. Rec. S8339 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (remarks
of Sen. Exon).  Congress determined that a legislative response was
necessary to ensure that the Internet would be a &quot;family friendly
resource&quot; (142 Cong. Rec. S718 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1996) (remarks of
Sen. Exon)) that would be &quot;more frequently used&quot; (141 Cong. Rec.
S8339 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Exon)).  Congress
wanted to make the Internet &quot;even bigger, and * * * even better, *
* * but not for raunchy pornography that would turn most people
off.&quot;  Id. at S8339-S8340.
     Over a period of approximately one and one-half years,
Congress considered a variety of ways to address the problem of
children's access to sexually explicit material on the Internet.
In the summer of 1994, Senator Exon proposed an extension of the
existing prohibition against &quot;indecent&quot; telephone communications to
reach &quot;indecent&quot; communications through &quot;telecommunications
device[s].&quot;  See 140 Cong. Rec. S9745 (daily ed. July 26, 1994).
The Senate Commerce Committee issued a report on that proposal, see
S. Rep. No. 367, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 17, 102 (1994), but Congress
did not otherwise act upon it.  The following February, Senator
Exon reintroduced his proposed legislation as The &quot;Communications
Decency Act of 1995&quot; (S. 314, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995), see
141 Cong. Rec. S1920 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1995)), and he later
refined the proposal with two amendments (141 Cong. Rec. S8120
(daily ed. June 9, 1995); 141 Cong. Rec. S8328 (daily ed. June 14,
1995)).
     Others in the Senate proposed addressing the problem in
different ways, such as by revising existing prohibitions on
indecent broadcasting to include the transmission of indecent
material using computers, see 141 Cong. Rec. S7922-S7923 (daily ed.
June 7, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Grassley), by requiring tagging of
indecent computer text or graphics, see 141 Cong. Rec. S8368 (daily
ed. June 14, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Inouye), or by soliciting a
report from the Attorney General on steps that could be taken to
prevent unwanted indecency, see id. at S8327-S8328 (remarks of Sen.
Leahy).  In June 1995, the Senate adopted the Exon proposal.  141
Cong. Rec. S8480 (daily ed. June 15, 1995).
     In October 1995, the House adopted a somewhat different
approach, approving a prohibition against the &quot;communicat[ion] by
computer&quot; of &quot;patently offensive&quot; sexually explicit material.  141
Cong. Rec. H9999 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1995).  A conference between
the House and Senate reconciled the two approaches, see S. Conf.
Rep. No. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-188 (1996), and in February
1996, the CDA was ultimately enacted in its current form.  That
legislation was the product of considerable debate in both houses
(see e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S8087-S8091 (daily ed. June 9, 1995); 141
Cong. Rec. S8327-S8347 (daily ed. June 14, 1995); 141 Cong. Rec.
H8468-H8472 (daily ed. Aug. 4, 1995); 142 Cong. Rec. S694-S695,
S706, S707, S714-S715, S717-S718, H1165-H1166 (daily ed. Feb. 1,
1996)); hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee (see
Cyberporn and Children:  The Scope of the Problem, the State of the
Technology, and the Need for Congressional Action, Hearing Before
the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1995)
(Cyberporn Hearing)); and negotiations among conference
participants (see 142 Cong. Rec. H1166 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1996)
(remarks of Rep. Berman)).
     3.  The CDA contains three primary restrictions on the
dissemination of sexually explicit material to children.  The first
(the transmission provision), imposes criminal penalties on
&quot;[w]hoever * * * by means of a telecommunications device knowingly
* * * (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the
transmission of, any * * * communication which is * * * indecent,
knowing that the recipient of the communication is under 18 years
of age.&quot;   47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B).  The second (the specific child
provision) imposes criminal penalties on any person who uses an
&quot;interactive computer service&quot; to &quot;send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age * * * any * * * communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.&quot;  47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(A).  The third (the
display provision) imposes criminal penalties on persons who use an
interactive computer service to &quot;display&quot; patently offensive sexual
material &quot;in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age.&quot;
47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(B).[2]   Because a &quot;telecommunications device&quot;
includes a modem (J.S. App. 6a-7a n.5), and an &quot;interactive
computer service&quot; includes a &quot;service or system that provides
access to the Internet&quot; (47 U.S.C. 230(e)(2); 47 U.S.C. 223(h)(2)),
all of the CDA's basic prohibitions apply to the dissemination of
information over the Internet.[3]  Although the transmission
provision prohibits &quot;indecent&quot; communications, whereas the specific
child and display provisions prohibit &quot;patently offensive&quot; sexually
explicit communications, Congress intended for those two
formulations to be used interchangeably.  S. Conf. Rep. No. 230,
supra, at 188.  In other words, indecent is shorthand for patently
offensive sexually explicit communications, and the latter is the
definition of the former.  J.S. App. 110a.
     The CDA establishes a &quot;defense to * * * prosecution&quot; for a
person who &quot;has restricted access to such [indecent] communication
by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult
access code, or adult personal identification number,&quot; 47 U.S.C.
223(e)(5)(B).  A defense to prosecution is also available to those
who have &quot;taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent
access by minors&quot; to their indecent communications.  47 U.S.C.
223(e)(5)(A).
     4.  The day the President signed the CDA into law, appellee
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), joined by other
organizations and individuals, filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the
Attorney General and the Department of Justice to challenge the
constitutionality of the CDA's restrictions on indecent and
patently offensive communications.  J.S. App. 3a.  The ACLU
appellees alleged that the CDA's restrictions are facially
unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Id. at 2a.  The district court
issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) against enforcement of
the Act's restrictions on &quot;indecent&quot; communications, but rejected
appellees' request for a TRO against enforcement of the
restrictions on &quot;patently offensive&quot; communications.  Id. at 153a-
161a.  Appellee American Library Association, the major online
service providers (including America Online, Inc., CompuServe, and
Prodigy), and various other organizations subsequently filed their
own facial constitutional challenge to the same provisions.  Id. at
4a-5a &amp; n.3.
     The two suits were consolidated, and pursuant to Section
561(a) of the CDA, 110 Stat. 142, were heard by a three-judge
court.  After a hearing, the court granted appellees' motion for a
preliminary injunction.  J.S. App. 1a-149a.  For reasons stated in
three separate opinions, the court concluded that appellees had
demonstrated &quot;a reasonable probability of eventual success in the
litigation&quot; by demonstrating that the CDA's restrictions on
indecent communications are &quot;unconstitutional on their face.&quot;  Id.
at 62a.
     a.  All three members of the court concluded that the
statutory restrictions on indecent communications violate the First
Amendment rights of adults to disseminate sexually explicit
material to other adults.  In her lead opinion, Judge Sloviter
reasoned that the CDA's restrictions were &quot;subject to strict
scrutiny&quot; and could be upheld only if they were &quot;narrowly tailored&quot;
to effectuate a &quot;compelling government interest.&quot;  J.S. App. 67a.
Judge Sloviter found that &quot;there is certainly a compelling
government interest to shield a substantial number of minors from
some of the online material that motivated Congress to enact the
CDA.&quot;  Id. at 72a-73a.  She concluded, however, that the CDA's
restrictions are not narrowly tailored to vindicate that interest.
     Judge Sloviter premised that conclusion on a determination
that &quot;it is either technologically impossible or economically
prohibitive&quot; for &quot;many&quot; Internet users to limit their
communications to adults.  J.S. App. 73a-74a.  In particular, she
found that &quot;no technology exists which allows those posting on the
category of newsgroups, mail exploders or chat rooms to screen for
age, id. at 74a, and that while &quot;efforts at age verification are
technically feasible&quot; on the World Wide Web, &quot;as a practical
matter, non-commercial organizations and even many commercial
organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively expensive
and burdensome to engage in * * * age verification,&quot; ibid.  Judge
Sloviter therefore concluded that, for many Internet users, the CDA
operates as a &quot;complete ban&quot; on adult-to-adult communication of
indecent material, ibid., and she viewed such a ban as
unconstitutional under this Court's decision in Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).   J.S.
App. 74a.  Judge Buckwalter concurred in that portion of Judge
Sloviter's opinion.  Id. at 84a.
     Judge Dalzell also concluded that the CDA's indecency
restrictions violate the First Amendment, but under a different
analysis.  He reasoned that, because &quot;the Internet has achieved,
and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of
mass speech that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet
seen,&quot; J.S. App. 141a, Congress &quot;may not regulate indecency on the
Internet at all,&quot;  id. at 131a.
     b.  Judge Buckwalter and Judge Sloviter further concluded that
the CDA's restrictions are unconstitutionally vague.  As an initial
matter, both judges assumed that the &quot;indecent&quot; communications
restricted by Section 223(a) are the same as the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; communications restricted by Section 223(d) -- both
refer to material &quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs,&quot; 47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(B).
J.S. App. 64a-65a, 92a-93a.  Judge Buckwalter viewed that
definition as unconstitutionally vague because it does not
expressly restrict the communications that it prohibits to those
that are indecent for &quot;the medium of cyberspace&quot; (id. at 95a), and
because it does not expressly state whether the relevant community
standard is a uniform national standard or a local standard that
varies depending upon where children receive the information (id.
at 96a-97a).  Judge Sloviter agreed that the terms &quot;'indecent' and
'patently offensive' are inherently vague.&quot;  Id. at 80a.
     Like the other two judges, Judge Dalzell determined that the
&quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; communications restricted by
the CDA are governed by the same definition -- speech that &quot;in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.&quot;  J.S. App. 110a.  He concluded, however,
that the terms as so defined are not unconstitutionally vague.  He
reasoned that the definition &quot;contains a subset of the elements of
obscenity&quot; set forth in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973),
that this Court has upheld the Miller standard against vagueness
challenges, and that &quot;the omission of parts of that test does not
warrant a contrary conclusion.&quot;  J.S. App. 111a-112a.
     c.  Based on its conclusion that the CDA's restrictions on
indecent communications are facially unconstitutional, the three-
judge court entered a preliminary injunction preventing the
Attorney General from &quot;enforcing, prosecuting, investigating or
reviewing any matter premised upon&quot; the restrictions on the
transmission or display of indecent material.  J.S. App. 148a-
149a.[4]
                        SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
     I.  Parents and their children have a First Amendment right to
receive information and acquire knowledge, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262
U.S. 390, 399-401 (1923), and the Internet has unmatched potential
to facilitate that interest.  Much of the Internet's potential as
an educational and informational resource will be wasted, however,
if people are unwilling to avail themselves of its benefits because
they do not want their children harmed by exposure to patently
offensive sexually explicit material.  The government therefore not
only has an especially strong interest in protecting children from
patently offensive material on the Internet, it has an equally
compelling interest in furthering the First Amendment interest of
all Americans to use what has become an unparalleled educational
resource.  The Communications Decency Act of 1996 constitutionally
advances those interests.
     A.  The transmission and specific child provisions prohibit
the sending of indecent material to children with knowledge that
the recipient is under 18.  Those provisions are essentially no
different from the prohibition on the sale of indecent material to
minors upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968).  Like
that prohibition, the transmission and specific child provisions
directly prevent the dissemination of indecent material to children
without prohibiting adult access to that material.  Because there
is no First Amendment right to disseminate indecent material to
children, the transmission and specific child provisions must be
upheld.
     B.  The display provision is also constitutional.  When read
together with the defenses to prosecution, the display provision
permits persons to post indecent material on the Internet so long
as they condition access on the use of credit cards or other adult
identification devices, or otherwise employ reasonable, effective,
and appropriate measures to ensure that their materials are not
available to minors.  That approach is constitutional under  FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 749 (1978).  Just as it was
constitutional for the FCC to channel indecent broadcasts to times
of the day when children most likely would not be exposed to them,
so Congress could channel indecent communications to places on the
Internet where children are unlikely to obtain them.  Indeed, there
is a stronger justification for the display provision than there
was for the restriction approved in Pacifica.  The indecency
problem on the Internet is much more pronounced than it is on
broadcast stations.  And unless steps are taken to restrict the
availability of such material to children, many parents may be
deterred from bringing the Internet into their homes at all.
     City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986)
and Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976).
also support the constitutionality of the display provision.  In
effect, the display provision operates as an adult &quot;cyberzoning&quot;
restriction, very much like the adult theater zoning ordinances
upheld in Renton and Young.  Just as the cities of Detroit and
Renton could direct adult theaters away from residential
neighborhoods, so Congress could direct purveyors of indecent
material away from areas of cyberspace that are easily accessible
to children.
     C.  The display provision does not impose a flat ban on
indecent communication.  Current technology affords significant
opportunities for adults to communicate and receive indecent
material over the Internet and through other channels.  For
example, those who post indecent material on Web sites for
commercial purposes can ensure that only adults have access to
their material by requiring a credit card number or an adult ID.
Similarly, operators of noncommercial Web sites can use adult
verification services for that purpose.  There are also ways to
communicate through other Internet applications that would not
expose children to indecency.  And, as technology evolves, the
opportunities for adult-to-adult communication of indecent material
will expand even further.  The district court's decision, which was
premised on its characterization of the display provision as a flat
ban on indecent communications, is therefore incorrect.
     D.  There is no less burdensome way to vindicate the
government's vital interests that would work equally well.
Congress reasonably determined that commercial software that
attempts to screen out indecent information only partially
addresses the problem.  Such software cannot identify all existing
sexually explicit sites; it cannot keep pace with the rapid
emergence of numerous new sexually explicit sites; it places the
entire burden on parents; and it is owned by only a small fraction
of Americans.
     In the short run, the CDA may impose some burdens and costs on
adult-to-adult communication of indecent material.  Congress
constitutionally decided, however, that it is better to place some
burdens and costs on those who disseminate patently offensive
material through use of a new and rapidly changing technology than
it is to leave children unprotected.
     II.  The district court erred in finding the CDA's
restrictions unconstitutionally vague.  The restrictions apply only
to material that, &quot;in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot;  47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1).
That formulation gives fair warning concerning the great bulk of
what is and is not covered.
     The CDA's definition of indecency is similar to one of the
elements that this Court used to define obscenity in Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and to one of the elements that New
York used to define material harmful to minors in Ginsberg.  And it
is almost identical to the definition of indecency upheld against
a vagueness challenge in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications
Consortium v. FCC, 116 S. Ct. 2374 (1996).  Those decisions
strongly support the conclusion that the CDA's definition of
indecency is not unconstitutionally vague.
     The historical meaning of the CDA's indecency definition and
the CDA's legislative history indicate that the kind of graphic
pictures that appear in soft-porn and hard-core porn magazines
almost always would be covered, while material having scientific,
educational, or news value almost always would not be covered.
There may be borderline cases in which it is difficult to determine
on which side of the line particular material falls.  But that does
not show that the CDA's definition of indecency is
unconstitutionally vague.
     III.  Even if the display provision were unconstitutional in
some of its applications, the district court erred in enjoining
enforcement of all three provisions in their entirety.  The CDA is
governed by a severability clause that makes clear that any invalid
provision is severable from the rest.  The severability clause also
makes clear that if application of particular provisions is invalid
in some respects, the CDA should otherwise remain intact.
     Under the severability clause, any infirmity in the display
provision could not affect the transmission and specific child
provisions.  Moreover, even assuming the display provision were
invalid in some of its applications, the district court had no
justification for invalidating the display provision in other
respects -- e.g., as applied to material displayed for commercial
purposes.  The constitutionality of that application is not open to
serious question.
     Because the CDA's restrictions are all facially
constitutional, and because any infirmity in those provisions could
not justify the district court's sweeping injunction, the district
court's judgment should be reversed.
                             ARGUMENT
     I.   THE CDA'S INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS CONSTITUTIONALLY ADVANCE
          THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERESTS IN PROTECTING CHILDREN AND IN
          ENSURING THAT PERSONS ARE NOT DETERRED FROM USING THE
          INTERNET AND OTHER INTERACTIVE COMPUTER SERVICES
     Congress enacted the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA),
Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 133, to protect children from
exposure to sexually explicit material that is now widely
disseminated on the Internet.  Equally significant, Congress sought
to make the Internet a resource that all Americans could use
without fear that their children would be exposed to the harmful
effects of indecent material.  The CDA's restrictions on indecent
communications constitutionally advance those interests.  They
prohibit persons from transmitting indecent material to children,
while affording significant opportunities for adults to disseminate
indecent material to other adults.  Applying the principles that
this Court has developed in other contexts, the CDA's restrictions
are therefore facially constitutional.
     A.   This Court Has Developed Several Principles For
          Evaluating The Constitutionality of Restrictions On
          Indecent Communications In Various Contexts
     This Court has not previously addressed the standards for
judging the constitutionality of government restrictions on the
communication of indecent material over the Internet or other
interactive computer services.  This Court has, however, developed
principles for assessing restrictions on the dissemination of
indecent material in other contexts.  Those principles should guide
the Court's analysis in this case as well.  After identifying the
basic principles in this part of the brief, we shall explain in the
succeeding parts why the CDA provisions that the district court
enjoined are constitutional under those principles.
     1.  First, because children generally do not possess the same
capacity as adults to make informed choices about whether to view
indecent material, and because such speech may have deep and
harmful effects on children that cannot readily be undone, there is
no First Amendment right to distribute indecent material to
children.  Thus, government regulation that prohibits the
dissemination of indecent material to children, while not
prohibiting dissemination to adults, is fully consistent with the
First Amendment.
     Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), establishes that
principle.  There, the Court rejected a First Amendment challenge
to the constitutionality of a criminal statute that punished the
sale to minors of sexually explicit magazines that were &quot;patently
offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole
with respect to what is suitable material for minors.&quot;  Id. at 633.
In sustaining that statute, the Court found it sufficient that the
State could rationally conclude that exposure to such material was
harmful to minors.  Id. at 641.  As this Court has subsequently
explained, Ginsberg holds that bookstores and movie theaters &quot;may
be prohibited from making indecent material available to children.&quot;
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 749 (1978); id. at 758
(Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).
Such entities may withhold indecent material from children, but
still sell it to adults.  Ibid.
     2.  Second, when the dissemination of indecency to adults
poses a substantial risk that children will be exposed to the
material, government may channel the indecent communications so as
to minimize the risk of children being exposed.   Pacifica best
illustrates that principle.  There, the Court upheld an FCC
decision holding that a radio station could be sanctioned for an
afternoon broadcast of a comedy routine containing a stream of
sexually explicit words.  The Court explained that &quot;broadcast media
have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all
Americans,&quot; 438 U.S. at 748; that &quot;[p]atently offensive, indecent
material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not
only in public, but also in the privacy of the home,&quot; ibid.; that
&quot;prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener or viewer
from unexpected program content,&quot; ibid.; that &quot;broadcasting is
uniquely accessible to children,&quot; id. at 749; that the FCC had not
&quot;intended to place an absolute prohibition on the broadcast of
[indecent] language, but rather sought to channel it to times of
day when children most likely would not be exposed to it,&quot; id. at
732-733; and that &quot;[a]dults who feel the need may purchase tapes
and records or go to theaters and nightclubs to hear these words,&quot;
id. at 750 &amp; n.28.
     Similarly, in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications
Consortium v. FCC, 116 S. Ct. 2374 (1996), the Court upheld a
provision permitting cable system operators to prohibit patently
offensive programming over leased access channels.  A plurality of
the Court did so on the authority of Pacifica, reasoning that cable
television poses the same serious and pervasive risk of exposing
children to indecent material as broadcast stations.  Id. at 2386-
2388.
     3.  Third, government may adopt reasonable zoning schemes to
address the secondary effects of sexually explicit communications.
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986) and
Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976),
establish that point.  In City of Renton, the Court upheld a zoning
ordinance that prohibited theaters that show sexually explicit
adult movies from locating within 1000 feet of any residential
zone, single or multiple family dwelling, church, park, or school.
475 U.S. at 44-45.  In Young, the Court upheld a zoning ordinance
that prohibited movie theaters that show sexually explicit movies
from locating within 1000 feet of any similar establishment or
within 500 feet of a residential area.  427 U.S. at 52.  A majority
of the Court agreed on a rationale for those decisions in City of
Renton.  The Court explained that zoning restrictions on businesses
that purvey sexually explicit material are constitutional when they
are aimed at the secondary effects of such businesses (such as
crime, loss of retail trade, reductions in property values, and
reduced quality of urban life), and when they allow for reasonable
alternative avenues of communication.  475 U.S. at 47-50.  The
latter inquiry, moreover, focuses on whether the regulation leaves
open alternative locations as a legal matter, not whether sites are
currently on the market or are commercially viable.  Id. at 53-54.
     4.  Fourth, government generally may not adopt an outright ban
on the dissemination of indecent material to adults.  Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989),
illustrates that principle.  In that case, the Court held
unconstitutional a legal prohibition against any dissemination of
indecent telephone messages for commercial purposes (dial-a-porn).
Although the Court acknowledged that the government had a
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children from dial-a-porn, id.
at 126, it rejected the government's argument that a flat ban on
such messages was appropriate to vindicate that interest.  The
Court explained that &quot;the government may not 'reduce the adult
population . . . to . . . only what is fit for children.'&quot;  Id. at
127-128.  The Court also emphasized that the FCC had &quot;determined
that its credit card, access code, and scrambling rules were a
satisfactory solution to the problem of keeping indecent dial-a-
porn messages out of the reach of minors,&quot; ibid., and that there
was no evidence to suggest that reliance on such measures would not
protect all but &quot;the most enterprising and disobedient young
people,&quot;  id. at 130.  Because there was an alternative to a flat
ban that would have effectively vindicated the government's
interest in protecting children, Sable does not resolve whether an
outright prohibition is permissible when there is no reasonably
effective alternative.
     5.  Finally, when government restrictions substantially burden
or deter adult access to indecent communications, and a
significantly less burdensome alternative will satisfy the
government's interests equally well, the government must choose the
less burdensome alternative.  Denver Area illuminates that
principle.  There, the Court held unconstitutional a provision that
required cable operators to segregate and block patently offensive
sex-related material appearing on leased channels, to unblock the
channel within 30 days of a subscriber's written request, and to
reblock within 30 days of such a request.  116 S. Ct. at 2390-2391.
In invalidating that provision, the Court emphasized its &quot;obvious
restrictive effects&quot;:  the significant delays required subscribers
to engage in considerable advance planning; the written notice
requirement could deter subscribers who feared release of their
identities; and the additional costs and burdens could encourage
cable operators to ban programs they might otherwise be inclined to
show.  Id. at 2391.  The Court also stressed that Congress had
recently adopted an alternative approach for unleased cable
channels that was &quot;significantly less restrictive,&quot; and the record
did not explain how Congress could conclude that its more recent
approach would be effective for unleased channels but ineffective
for leased channels.  Id. at 2392.
     6.  Applying the principles discussed above, the CDA's
transmission and specific child provisions are constitutional under
the Ginsberg principle.  The display provision is constitutional
under both the Pacifica and Renton principles.  None of the CDA's
restrictions operates as a flat ban, and there is no equally
effective way to serve the government's vital interests.  The CDA's
restrictions therefore do not violate the principles of Sable or
Denver Area.[5]
     B.   The Transmission And Specific Child Provisions Are
          Facially Constitutional
     1.  The transmission provision forbids any person from using
a &quot;telecommunications device&quot; to &quot;knowingly * * * make[], create[],
or solicit[], and * * * initiate[] the transmission of&quot; any
&quot;communication which is * * * indecent, knowing that the recipient
of the communication is under 18 years of age.&quot;  47 U.S.C.
223(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).  By its terms, that prohibition
applies only in situations in which a person transmits indecent
material to another person, knowing that person is under 18.  For
example, if an adult learned that one of the participants in a chat
room was under 18, and then sent a private indecent communication
to that individual by e-mail, the transmission provision would be
violated.
     As that example illustrates, to comply with the transmission
provision, persons need not refrain from communicating indecent
material to adults; they need only refrain from disseminating such
materials to persons they know to be under 18.  The transmission
provision is therefore precisely tailored to meet the government's
interest in shielding children from indecent material.  At the same
time, the provision does not prohibit communications between
adults.
     The transmission provision is essentially no different from
the prohibition on the sale of indecent material to minors upheld
in Ginsberg.  Like that prohibition, the transmission provision
directly prevents the dissemination of indecent material to
children without restricting adult access to that material.  The
district court therefore erred in enjoining its enforcement.
     2.  The same is true of the specific child provision, which
prohibits persons from &quot;knowingly * * * us[ing] an interactive
computer service to send&quot; patently offensive sexually explicit
material &quot;to a specific person or persons under 18 years of age.&quot;
47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(A).  Like the transmission provision, the
specific child provision applies only to situations in which a
person sends indecent material to someone he knows to be under 18.
Because the provision is aimed at messages knowingly directed to
minors, it does not prohibit adult-to-adult communications, and the
district court erred in enjoining its enforcement.[6]
     3.  In their responses to our jurisdictional statement,
appellees did not contend that the transmission and specific child
provisions are facially unconstitutional if construed as we have
suggested.  Appellees instead contended that those provisions
should be construed far more expansively to reach any communication
&quot;that might be seen by any minor.&quot;  ACLU Mot. to Aff. 26.  That
interpretation, however, reads the &quot;knowledge&quot; requirement out of
the transmission provision and the &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;specific&quot;
requirements out of the specific child provision.  Because
appellees' interpretation cannot be squared with the text of the
provisions, it must be rejected.
     Nor do those provisions penalize the sending of an indecent
message to a place in cyberspace where minors would have the
ability to obtain it (ACLU Mot. to Aff. 26-27 ).  That conduct is
addressed by the display provision, which prohibits the use of a
computer &quot;to display in a manner available&quot; to children sexually
explicit material.  47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(B).  The transmission and
specific child provisions have a narrower scope.  Their terms
require that the person initiating the indecent communication must
know that a specific recipient of his message is under 18.
     Appellees contend (ACLU Mot. to Aff. 26) that the knowledge
requirement in the specific child provision requires only knowledge
that a computer is being used, not knowledge that the specific
child receiving the message is under 18 years of age.  Under basic
principles of statutory construction, however, the knowledge
requirement applies to both elements of the offense.
The specific child provision applies to:
     (d) Whoever --
        (1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly --
          (A) uses an interactive computer service to send to
     a specific person or persons under 18 years of age,
     * * *
                             * * * * *
     any * * * communication, that, in context, depicts or
     describes in terms patently offensive * * * sexual or
     excretory activities or organs.
Because the use-of-computer requirement and the under-18
requirement appear in the same clause, and because the knowledge
requirement introduces that clause, it is perfectly natural to read
the knowledge requirement as applying to both elements.  Moreover,
any ambiguity must be resolved by resort to the &quot;presumption&quot; that
&quot;a scienter requirement should apply to each of the statutory
elements which criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.&quot;  United
States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 115 S. Ct. 464, 467-469, 472
(1994).
     The transmission and specific child provisions therefore
should be construed in the manner we have suggested.  As so
construed, they raise no serious constitutional question.
     C.  The Display Provision Is Facially Constitutional
     The display provision prohibits the use of an interactive
computer service to &quot;display&quot; indecent material &quot;in a manner
available&quot; to those under 18.  47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(B).  Because
information posted in public portions of the Internet, such as the
World Wide Web, newsgroups, or chat rooms, may be automatically
&quot;available&quot; to children as well as adults, the display provision
has the potential to affect adult-to-adult communication.  A person
has a &quot;defense to a prosecution,&quot; however, if he restricts access
to indecent materials &quot;by requiring use of a verified credit card,
debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification
number,&quot; 47 U.S.C. 223(e)(5)(B), or otherwise takes, &quot;in good
faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions * * * to
restrict or prevent access to minors,&quot; 47 U.S.C. 223(e)(5)(A).
When read together with the statutory defenses, the display
provision therefore permits persons to post indecent material on
the Internet so long as they condition access on the use of credit
cards or other adult identification devices, or otherwise employ
&quot;reasonable, effective, and appropriate&quot; measures to ensure that
their materials are not available to minors.  In that way, Congress
sought to keep sexually explicit materials on the Internet away
from children, while providing significant opportunities for adults
who are so inclined to receive such materials.
     1. a. The approach Congress enacted is constitutional under
Pacifica.  Like broadcast stations, the Internet is establishing an
increasingly &quot;pervasive presence&quot; in the lives of Americans.  438
U.S. at 748.  As many as 40 million people in the world use the
Internet today, and that figure is expected to grow to 200 million
by 1999.  J.S. App. 13a.  And while precise figures are not
available, the district court found that approximately 60% of the
host computers linked to the Internet are located in the United
States.  Ibid.  Like indecency presented on broadcast stations,
indecent material presented over the Internet &quot;confronts the
citizen * * * in the privacy of the home.&quot;  438 U.S. at 748.  Like
broadcast stations, the Internet &quot;is uniquely accessible to
children.&quot;  Id. at 749.  Indeed, as Congress recognized, children
have become &quot;the computer experts in our Nation's families.&quot;  141
Cong. Rec. S8332 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Coats).
As was true in Pacifica, Congress has not attempted to forbid all
indecent communications.  Just as the FCC sought to channel
indecent broadcasts &quot;to times of the day when children most likely
would not be exposed to it,&quot;  438 U.S. at 732-733, so Congress has
sought in the CDA to channel indecent communications to places on
the Internet where children are unlikely to obtain it.  And, as was
the case in Pacifica, adults who have a desire for indecent
material may obtain access to such material in other ways.  Id. at
750 &amp; n.28.  In addition to attending live theater and nightclubs,
adults interested in indecent material can purchase tapes, compact
discs, books, magazines, videotapes, and CD Roms.
     Moreover, in important ways, there is a stronger justification
for the restriction at issue here than there was for the one
approved in Pacifica.  Because millions of people disseminate
information on the Internet without the intervention of editors,
network censors, or market disincentives, the indecency problem on
the Internet is much more pronounced than it is on broadcast
stations.  The record in this case demonstrates the seriousness of
the problem.  It shows that sexually explicit material, &quot;from the
modestly titillating to the hardest-core,&quot; J.S. App. 47a, is widely
available on the Internet, and that computer-literate children can
easily find and retrieve it.  The government's expert, Howard A.
Schmidt, the director of the Air Force's computer crimes
investigations office, testified at length concerning the ease with
which sexually explicit materials can be retrieved through the
Internet and other interactive computer services.  See Schmidt
Decl. __ 7-10, 13-32, 36-37, 38-39.  Search terms such as &quot;xxx,&quot;
id. __ 7-10, &quot;xxx sex,&quot; __ 19-23, &quot;adult porn,&quot; id. _ 37, and &quot;porn
pictures,&quot; id. _ 38, retrieved long lists of sites containing
sexually explicit pictures.  Each retrieved site contained links to
other equally explicit sites, and access to those sites could be
obtained simply by clicking with a computer mouse on the
highlighted portion identifying the linked site.  See, e.g.,
Schmidt Decl. __ 10, 21(a), 35, 40.  Sexually explicit material can
also be accidentally retrieved by search terms that have no
necessary sexual connotation, such as &quot;Jasmine, &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot;
and &quot;Little Women.&quot;  Id. __ 33-35; DX 13A; 3/22/96 Tr. 26:14-29:21,
35:1-37:18.  Schmidt's declaration is accompanied in the record by
a notebook which contained printouts of each screen that he
described in his declaration.  That notebook graphically
illustrates the dimensions of the problem.
     The widespread availability of sexually explicit material on
the Internet and other interactive computer services has a
significance beyond the direct risk posed by such material to the
psychological well-being of children.[7]  Unless steps are taken to
restrict the availability of such material to children, parents and
schools may be deterred from permitting children to use interactive
computer services.  Indeed, many parents may be deterred from
bringing the Internet into their homes at all.
     The &quot;American people have always regarded education and
acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance.&quot;  Meyer
v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400 (1923).  That fundamental value
reflects &quot;[b]oth the importance of education in maintaining our
basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its deprivation on
the life of the child.&quot;  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982).
As a result, parents and their children have a profound interest,
protected by the First Amendment, in receiving information and
acquiring knowledge.  See Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 763
(1972); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 390 (1969);
Meyer, 262 U.S. at 399-401.  The Internet has unmatched potential
to facilitate that interest.
     Much of the Internet's potential as an educational and
informational resource will be lost, however, if substantial
numbers of people are unwilling to avail themselves of its benefits
because they do not want their children exposed to patently
offensive material.[8]  The result will be to exclude those children
from an equal opportunity to participate in the promise of our new
technological age.  The government therefore not only has a
compelling interest in protecting children from patently offensive
material on the Internet, it also has a compelling interest in
protecting the First Amendment interests of all Americans in using
what has become an unparalleled educational resource.  Under
Pacifica, the display provision is a constitutional way to further
those goals.
     b.  The district court concluded that Pacifica was inapposite,
because the danger of inadvertent exposure is not as pronounced on
the Internet as it is on broadcast stations.  J.S. App. 67a-68a.
Pacifica, however, depended not on that one factor alone, but on
the overall seriousness and pervasiveness of the problem, and the
ineffectiveness of parental supervision as the solution.  Far more
serious than the risk of inadvertent exposure is that indecent
material has the characteristics of an attractive &quot;nuisance,&quot; 438
U.S. at 750, which young children are likely to affirmatively seek
out.  Because there is a much larger quantity of indecent material
on the Internet than on broadcast stations, and because it is even
more difficult to monitor what a child views on the Internet than
it is to monitor what he or she watches and hears on broadcast
stations, the overall problem of childrens' unsupervised exposure
to sexually explicit material is much more serious on the Internet.
The district court's effort to distinguish Pacifica is therefore
unpersuasive.
     Appellees have suggested (ALA Resp. 11 n.8) that the scarcity
of broadcast spectrums justified the result in Pacifica.  In
applying the Pacifica rationale to cable television, however, the
plurality in Denver Area squarely rejected that characterization of
Pacifica.  The Denver Area plurality explained that Pacifica rests
on the effect of indecent programming on children, not on program
scarcity.  116 S. Ct. at 2388.  Pacifica is therefore directly
applicable in the present context and fully supports the
constitutionality of the CDA's display provision.
     2.  This Court's zoning decisions also support the
constitutionality of the display provision.  In effect, the display
provision operates as an adult &quot;cyberzoning&quot; restriction, very much
like the adult theater zoning ordinances upheld in Renton and
Young.  Just as the cities of Detroit and Renton could
constitutionally require adult theaters to locate outside of
residential neighborhoods, see 475 U.S. at 46; 427 U.S. at 52, so
Congress could permissibly instruct providers of indecent material
on the Internet to remove the material &quot;from areas of cyberspace
that are easily accessible to children&quot; and to place them in adult
cyberspace zones instead.  141 Cong. Rec. S8333 (daily ed. June 14,
1995) (remarks of Sen. Coats).
     The zoning restrictions upheld in Renton and Young were aimed
at the secondary effects of indecent communications, and that is
also true here.  The government's interest in ensuring that parents
are not deterred from allowing their children to use the Internet
is directly analogous to the concerns about crime, reduced property
value, and the quality of urban life that animated the cities in
Renton and Young.  In channeling indecent materials to adult areas
of cyberspace, the display provision seeks to ensure that the
Internet will not become a wasteland visited by a small segment of
the population, but will instead thrive and flourish as a gathering
place for all Americans.  And here, as in Renton and Young, the
government's goal is &quot;not to suppress the expression of unpopular
views.&quot;  Renton, 475 U.S. at 48.
     The effect of patently offensive sexually explicit materials
on children is also properly viewed as a secondary effect.  It is
true that the harm to children is the consequence of the indecent
material and therefore could in a sense be viewed as a primary
rather than a secondary effect.  Because there is no First
Amendment right to disseminate indecent material to children,
however, the harmful effect of such materials on children is better
understood as a secondary effect of constitutionally protected
adult-to-adult communication.  Put differently, the government's
interest in protecting children from patently offensive sexually
explicit depictions and descriptions is as legitimate and unrelated
to the suppression of constitutionally protected expression as the
government's interests in reducing crime, maintaining property
values, and preserving the quality of urban life.  Thus, as long as
a government zoning scheme is justified by the effects of indecent
communications on children rather than adults, and leaves open
reasonable opportunities for adult-to-adult communication, it is
constitutionally permissible.  That is the situation here.
     D.  The Display Provision Does Not Operate As A Flat Ban
     The district court concluded that the display provision
operates as a flat ban on indecent speech, in violation of the
general principle identified in Sable.  See J.S. App. 73a-74a
(Sloviter, J.), 84a (Buckwalter, J.).  That conclusion was premised
on a determination that the statutory defenses are not available as
a practical matter to most providers of material over the Internet
and that such providers would therefore have to eliminate indecent
speech entirely from their communications in order to comply with
the display provision.  The record demonstrates, however, that the
CDA's display provision (in conjunction with the statutory
defenses) leaves open significant opportunities for adult-to-adult
communication.  That provision therefore cannot reasonably be
viewed as a flat ban.
     1. a.  First, it is clear that those who post patently
offensive sexually explicit material on their Web sites for
commercial purposes can take advantage of the statutory defenses.
The district court below specifically found that current technology
permits the operator of a Web site to screen those who seek access
to the site by requesting a credit card number or adult ID.  J.S.
App. 51a.   Moreover, the record in this case demonstrates that
many commercial sites that display sexually explicit content
already use credit card and other adult verification devices to
screen for age.  Id. at 135a (Dalzell, J.); see also Shea v. Reno,
930 F. Supp. 916, 943 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (noting that &quot;[m]any
commercial content providers charge a fee to permit a user to gain
access to sexually explicit content, thus necessitating credit card
verification in any event&quot;); Schmidt Decl. __ 12, 22; Schmidt Exhs.
3, 22, 29, 31 (examples of Web sites that provide access to
sexually explicit material only upon the presentation or use of a
valid credit card or a valid account with &quot;First Virtual,&quot; a
company that provides Internet users with a personal identification
number once they provide valid credit card information).  It is
therefore beyond dispute that commercial providers have the ability
to post indecent information on the Internet and limit access to
that material to adults.[9]
     Even though many commercial providers already require a credit
card or adult ID for purchase of their material, the CDA
nonetheless serves an important function.  As Congress was aware,
commercial providers often post free &quot;teasers&quot; on their Web sites,
&quot;not unlike coming attractions [at] the movies,&quot; to promote their
products.  141 Cong. Rec. S8090 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (remarks
of Sen. Exon).  &quot;[T]hey * * * take the best and most enticing
pictures of whatever they want to sell that particular day or that
particular week and enter it * * * on the Internet,&quot; ibid., in
order to entice consumers to purchase other similar material.  If
the CDA's display provision were upheld, commercial pornographers
would quickly end that practice.
     There is nothing constitutionally suspect about requiring
commercial Web site operators who profit from indecent material,
but do not currently use credit cards or adult IDs as screening
devices, to shoulder the modest burdens associated with their use.
Nor does the First Amendment even arguably preclude government from
requiring commercial providers who profit from credit card sales to
use those same cards to ensure that only adults obtain access to
their sites.  The constitutionality of applying the CDA's display
provision to commercial providers is therefore not open to serious
question.  Shea, 930 F. Supp. at 942-943 (the credit card and adult
ID safe harbor &quot;serves as an adequate defense for at least certain
commercial providers of Web content -- specifically, those who
primarily make Web content available for 'purchase' or, put another
way, those who charge Web users to gain access to, and view, their
content&quot;).  At the very least, the district court erred in entering
a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the CDA's
provisions against commercial providers, because they have not and
cannot make the requisite showing of a likelihood of success on the
merits of their constitutional claim.  See Walters v. Nat'l Ass'n
of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 316-317 (1985).
     b.  Operators of commercial and noncommercial Web sites can
also take advantage of the statutory defenses by using &quot;adult
verification services,&quot; such as AdultCheck.  See J.S. App. 55a-56a.
Such services, which maintain their own Web sites, charge persons
a nominal yearly fee (such as $9.95) to obtain an adult
identification number that can be used to gain access to Web sites
registered with the service.  When a user goes to a registered
site, he enters his adult ID number.  If the number is valid, the
user is automatically admitted to the site; if the number is
invalid, entry to the site is denied.  See generally Schmidt Decl.
_ 11; Schmidt Exh. 6 (describing &quot;AdultCheck&quot; service); Schmidt
Exh. 8 (describing &quot;Validate&quot; service).  Verification services
ordinarily do not charge the operator of a Web site a fee; on the
contrary, they are often willing to pay the Web site operator to
refer customers to their service, and will help the operator set up
the means for password entry and verification.  See generally
Schmidt Decl. _ 11; Schmidt Exhs. 6, 8; see also Shea, 930 F. Supp.
at 934.
     The district court discounted the significance of adult
verification services because the government's evidence as to their
operation was derived primarily from publicly available promotional
materials.  J.S. App. 55a.  But it is undisputed that such services
are currently being used by purveyors of sexually explicit material
on the Internet, see Schmidt Decl. _ 11; Schmidt Exh. 6, at 3-4
(listing sites using AdultCheck), and appellees offered no evidence
that the services do not or could not work as advertised.
     Appellees have also contended that adult ID services are not
an available option for noncommercial Web sites because such
services are currently used exclusively by commercial pornographers
with whom appellees would prefer not to be associated.  ALA Resp.
17.  If appellees were to begin to use such existing adult
verification services, however, such services would no longer be
tainted by an exclusive association with commercial pornographers.
In any event, appellees are free to pool their resources to
establish their own adult ID service or to hire another entity to
provide such a service for them.  The adult ID defense is therefore
available to non-commercial Web site operators, and the display
provision is constitutional as applied to them.
     c.  Those seeking to use other forms of communication over the
Internet can also take advantage of the statutory defenses.   For
example, persons can post messages in a freestanding mailing list,
newsgroup, or chat room directing participants to a Web site that
is screened for age to view a particular patently offensive
message.  Anyone visiting the site who wished to respond in the
same patently offensive fashion could do so by e-mail.  Mail
exploder and chat room users who want to disseminate patently
offensive material can start a closed mailing list or chat room
that has rules limiting participation to adults; newsgroup users
who wish to exchange patently offensive material could also set up
their own list of servers and screen for age.  See Shea, 930 F.
Supp. at 947-948.  Other options may soon be available.  For
example, since the record was compiled at the preliminary
injunction stage of the case, it has become clear that chat rooms,
newsgroups, and mailing lists can be established on a Web site,
where those who wish to post patently offensive material can avail
themselves of the very same screening technologies that apply to
the Web.[10]
     d.  While the display provision already affords numerous
opportunities for adult-to-adult communication of indecency, the
rapid development of technology on the Internet is certain to
facilitate even more.  For example, the technology already exists
for &quot;tagging&quot; patently offensive communications in all major
Internet applications.  See Olsen Decl. __ 43-111, 134.  One way
for such a system to operate would be for there to be a consensus
on a tag (an identifying code) that indicates that material is
being marked for compliance with the CDA's indecency restrictions
(similar to the R-rating for movies).  Shea, 930 F. Supp. at 932-
933.  Web browsers could then be programmed to recognize and
automatically block material that has been tagged, leaving parents
and other adults the option to unblock it by means of a device that
did not permit ready access by children.  In light of the rapid
development and innovative capabilities of Internet industry
participants, there is every reason to expect that effective
tagging and blocking or other technological solutions will be
created if the CDA's indecency restrictions are upheld.  In the
meantime, Congress permissibly decided that it is better to place
some burdens and costs on those who disseminate patently offensive
material through use of a new and rapidly changing technology than
it is to leave children unprotected.
     2.  Appellees attempt to defend the district court's
conclusion that the display provision operates as a flat ban by
characterizing it as a finding of fact.  ACLU Mot. to Aff. 18-20.
The district court's flat ban determination, however, is based on
two serious legal errors.  First, in deciding whether a particular
defense was effectively unavailable, the district court did not
limit its consideration to technical feasibility.  It also assessed
whether a particular method of compliance would impose costs or
burdens.  J.S. App. 74a.  Such costs and burdens are not irrelevant
to the question whether the display provision is constitutional.
As previously discussed, where significant costs and burdens are
shown and a significantly less burdensome alternative will
vindicate the government's interests equally well, the government
must choose the less burdensome alternative.  Denver Area, 116 S.
Ct. at 2390-2392.  The existence of burdens and costs associated
with adult-to-adult communication, however, does not transform a
restriction on the place and manner in which speech may be
communicated into a flat ban of the kind condemned in Sable.  Cf.
Renton, 475 U.S. at 53-54 (increased costs and burdens associated
with locating in an adult zone do not convert zoning restriction
into a flat ban); Sable, 492 U.S. at 125 (constitutional to require
message provider &quot;to incur some costs in developing and
implementing a system for screening the locale of incoming calls&quot;).
The district court erred as a matter of law in believing that it
did.
     Second, the district court assumed that the display provision
should be viewed as a flat ban unless most speakers are able to
communicate indecent speech over every possible Internet
application.  The proper inquiry, however, should be whether, on
the whole, that provision leaves open reasonable opportunities to
disseminate indecent material.  Cf. Renton, 475 U.S. at 54 (zoning
ordinance must provide reasonable opportunity for adult theaters to
operate within the city).  Nothing in this Court's First Amendment
jurisprudence suggests that a restriction on communicating
indecency over a medium should be viewed as a flat ban unless most
people are able to use every possible method of communicating
through that medium.  Because the display provision leaves open
reasonable opportunities for the transmission and receipt of
indecent material over the Internet and other interactive computer
services (not to mention avenues of communication outside of those
new technologies), it is not properly viewed as a flat ban.
     E.   There Are No Alternatives That Would Be Equally Effective
          In Advancing The Government's Interests
     The only remaining question is whether there is any
alternative way to satisfy the government's interests that would be
significantly less burdensome but would work equally well.
Appellees suggest (ALA Resp. 22-23) that commercial software that
attempts to screen out indecent information is such an alternative.
While Congress recognized that such software could provide &quot;part of
the [a]nswer&quot; to the problem of indecency on the Internet, it
reasonably determined that it could not provide &quot;the whole answer.&quot;
142 Cong. Rec. S706 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1996) (remarks of Sen.
Grassley).  Screening software is only partially effective in
screening indecent material, and Congress further determined that
it would not be fair for parents to have &quot;the sole responsibility
to spend their hard-earned money to ensure that cyberporn does not
flood into their homes through their personal computers.&quot;
Cyberporn Hearing at 2 (Sen. Grassley).
     One difficulty is that screening software must be programmed
to recognize each of the thousands of sites that may contain
indecent material, and &quot;new sites are constantly coming online.&quot;
J.S. App. 38a.  Because indecent material can appear in numerous
verbal forms, there can be no guarantee that any particular
software program will screen all indecent sites simply by searching
for particular words or phrases.  It is for that reason that
software producers employ persons to search the Internet for
indecent sites, see ibid., and charge subscribers significant fees
for regular supplements to their lists of blocked sites, id. at
39a, 41a.  Moreover, screening software is unable to &quot;screen for
sexually explicit images unaccompanied by suggestive text unless
those who configure the software are aware of the particular site.&quot;
Id. at 42a.  As a result, &quot;even where a parent has properly
installed screening software and the software is operational * * *
it is possible to retrieve some sexually explicit material.&quot;  Shea,
930 F. Supp. at 932.  Perhaps for that reason, parental control
software is used by only a very small percentage of households that
have access to the Internet.  For example, as of the time of the
Shea decision, approximately 450 individual households subscribed
to SurfWatch, one of the leading commercial screeners of indecency.
Ibid.  Thus, despite the district court's prediction that parental
control software might eventually be a reasonably effective method
of screening indecent communication, J.S. App. 42a, the district
court did not find that such software is currently effective in
serving the government's compelling interests, and it did not rely
on the availability of parental control software as a basis for its
ruling that the CDA's prohibitions are facially unconstitutional.
     Appellees offer two additional alternatives that are even less
effective in serving the government's compelling interests.  First,
appellees propose (ALA Resp. 23) that parents use a screening
mechanism that screens out all Internet speech that has not been
affirmatively identified as appropriate for children by a
particular rating service.  Because only a very small fraction of
Internet sites have been rated by any service, however, that option
would force parents to limit dramatically the amount of information
to which their children would have access.  Appellees' other
alternative is still more draconian -- parents could &quot;deny their
children the opportunity to participate in the medium.&quot;  Ibid.  Far
from being less restrictive, the two additional alternatives
proposed by appellees would seriously undermine the government's
ability to further the substantial First Amendment interests of all
parents and children in using what has become an unparalleled tool
for communicating and retrieving information.
     II.  THE CDA'S INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT
          UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE
     The CDA's indecency restrictions encompass the dissemination
of information that, &quot;in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot;  47 U.S.C. 223(d).  That
formulation is not unconstitutionally vague.
     In Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973), this Court
defined what States could regulate as obscenity -- namely material
that (1) &quot;appeals to the prurient interest,&quot; (2) &quot;depicts or
describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically
defined by the applicable state law,&quot; and (3) &quot;lacks serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&quot;   The CDA's
definition of patently offensive materials is similar to the second
element in that definition.  Because Miller held that the standard
it imposed is not unconstitutionally vague and that States could
criminally prosecute persons for violations of that standard, id.
at 27 &amp; n.10, Miller provides powerful support for the conclusion
that the CDA's definition of patently offensive materials is not
unconstitutionally vague.  Ginsberg reinforces that conclusion.
There, the Court rejected a vagueness challenge to a criminal
prohibition on the sale of obscene pictures to minors that included
as one element that the material be &quot;patently offensive to
prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect
to what is suitable material for minors.&quot;  390 U.S. at 632-633,
643.
     Similarly, in Denver Area, a four-person plurality of the
Court expressly rejected a vagueness challenge to a provision
giving cable operators a right to prohibit programming on leased
channels &quot;that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or
depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.&quot;
116 S. Ct. at 2381, 2389-2390.  Three other Justices voted to
uphold the constitutionality of that provision, thereby implicitly
rejecting the vagueness challenge.  Id. at 2419 (opinion of Thomas,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Because the CDA's
definition of indecency is almost identical to the definition
upheld against a vagueness challenge in Denver Area, that decision
also provides support for the conclusion that the CDA's
restrictions are not unconstitutionally vague.
     The Denver Area plurality's discussion of the issue
demonstrates why the CDA's definition of indecency is not
unconstitutionally vague.  The plurality explained that the
provision giving cable operators a right to bar patently offensive
communications aims at &quot;pictures of oral sex, bestiality, and rape
* * * and not at scientific or educational programs (at least
unless done with a highly unusual lack of concern for viewer
reaction).&quot;  116 S. Ct. at 2389-2390.  The plurality also noted
that &quot;what is 'patently offensive' depends on context (the kind of
program on which it appears)&quot; and &quot;degree (not `an occasional
expletive').&quot;  Id. at 2390.
     The legislative history to the CDA shows that Congress
intended to confine the CDA's restrictions on indecency in a
similar way.  The Conference Report states that the determination
whether material is patently offensive &quot;cannot be made without a
consideration of the context of the description or depiction at
issue,&quot; and that &quot;[m]aterial with serious redeeming value&quot; that &quot;is
quite obviously intended to edify and educate, not to offend,&quot; is
not patently offensive.  S. Conf. Rep. No. 230, 104th Cong., 2d
Sess. 189.  The Conference Report also explains that Congress
intended to codify the FCC's definition of indecency that was
approved in Pacifica.  Id. at 188.  In enforcing broadcast
indecency rules, the FCC has declined to take enforcement action
against a televised program that included candid discussions of
teenage sexuality and that used sex organ models to simulate the
use of various birth control devices.  The Commission explained
that &quot;the material presented was clinical or instructional in
nature and not presented in a pandering, titillating or vulgar
manner.&quot;  In re King Broadcasting Co., 5 F.C.C. Rcd. 2971 (1990).
The FCC has also dismissed a citizen's complaint concerning a radio
news story that had broadcasted a recording in which a reputed
Mafia figure used an expletive repeatedly in conversation.  Letter
to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 F.C.C. Rcd. 610 (1991), petition for review
dismissed, 993 F.2d 906 (D.C. Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct.
1610 (1994).
     Thus, material having scientific, educational, or news value
almost always falls outside the CDA's coverage.  On the other hand,
the kind of sexually explicit pictures that appear in the Schmidt
notebook in this case will almost always be covered.  Admittedly,
there may be borderline cases &quot;in which it is difficult to
determine the side of the line on which a particular fact situation
falls.&quot;  United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7 (1947).  But that
is not a &quot;sufficient reason to hold * * * language too ambiguous to
define a criminal offense.&quot;  Ibid.
     The Constitution requires government to &quot;give the person of
ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is
prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.&quot;  Grayned v. City of
Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).  Perfect clarity, however, is
neither possible nor constitutionally required.  Id. at 110;
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 361 (1983).  In light of their
history, the terms &quot;patently offensive&quot; and &quot;sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot; give fair warning concerning what types of
depictions and communications are and are not prohibited by the
CDA.  If the legislature is to be permitted to protect children by
regulating the dissemination of patently offensive communications,
no greater precision can be expected or required.
     III. THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ENTERED BY THE DISTRICT COURT
          WAS IN ANY EVENT FAR TOO BROAD IN SCOPE
     Finally, even if the display provision were unconstitutional
in some of its applications, the district court erred in enjoining
enforcement of all three provisions at issue in their entirety.
The CDA's indecency restrictions were each enacted as amendments to
the Communications Act of 1934.  Communications Decency Act of
1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, _ 502, 110 Stat. 133.  They are
therefore governed by the severability clause contained in that
Act, which provides that &quot;[i]f any provision of this chapter or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid,
the remainder of the chapter and the application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.&quot;
47 U.S.C. 608.  See Leavitt v. Jane L., 116 S. Ct. 2068, 2070
(1996) (relying on severability clause in the underlying Act to
which the challenged provisions were added).  As this Court has
noted, Section 608 &quot;indicate[s] in the strongest possible language
that any invalid provision [is] severable from the rest of the
Act.&quot;  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 739 n.13.  As a result, any infirmity
in the display prohibition would not affect the transmission and
specific person provisions.  Indeed, quite apart from the
severability provision, in light of Congress's basic objective of
protecting children, it simply is not possible that Congress would
have preferred no provisions at all to the two provisions standing
by themselves.  Cf. Denver Area, 116 S. Ct. at 2397.
     Section 608 is significant in another respect.  Under that
clause, any determination that the display provision is invalid as
applied to particular persons or specific circumstances shall not
affect its application &quot;to other persons or circumstances.&quot;  47
U.S.C. 608; see Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 460-461 &amp; n.14
(1992).  To take the clearest example, even assuming that the
display provision would have some invalid applications, there would
be no basis for invalidating the provision as applied to commercial
Web sites.  See also  Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S.
491, 503-504 (1985) (unless there are &quot;countervailing
considerations,&quot; a statute should &quot;be declared invalid to the
extent it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact&quot;); compare
United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct.
1003, 1019 &amp; n.26 (1995) (refusing to preserve certain applications
after finding an act of Congress unconstitutionally overbroad,
because Congress had sent conflicting signals as to where the new
line should be drawn, each of the new lines would raise independent
constitutional concerns, and there was no severability clause).
     Contrary to appellees' understanding (ALA Resp. 16; ACLU Mot.
to Aff. 24-25), our argument on this point is not that the district
court should have construed the CDA's display provision to reach
only commercial providers; nor do we argue that the district court
should have rewritten the statutory prohibition.  Instead,
consistent with the statutory command in the applicable
severability clause, the district court was required to limit it
preliminary injunctive relief to those applications for which it
found that appellees had made the requisite showing of probable
unconstitutionality, and to leave intact the rest.
     Despite its apparent agreement that the display provision
could be applied constitutionally to commercial providers, the
district court refused to leave that part of the prohibition
intact, on the ground that Congress made a conscious decision to
impose the CDA's restrictions on commercial and noncommercial
providers alike.  J.S. App. 75a-76a; see S. Conf. Rep. No. 230,
supra, at 191.  But that does not provide any basis for ignoring
the express terms of the severability clause.  Moreover, Congress
included noncommercial providers of patently offensive material
because it found &quot;that there is a great deal of [such] material on
the Internet available to anyone free of charge.&quot;  141 Cong. Rec.
S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Exon).  That
concern does not suggest that Congress would have wanted commercial
purveyors of indecency to proceed with impunity if a court were to
hold that regulation of some noncommercial providers lay beyond its
powers.  In fact, the supporters of the CDA repeatedly emphasized
that the Act would govern the activities of &quot;entrepreneurs who are
seeking money, cash money-making opportunities.&quot;  Id. at S8090
(daily ed. June 9, 1995) (remarks of Sen. Exon); 141 Cong. Rec.
8340 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (&quot;the moneymakers on pornography&quot;);
id. at S8333 (remarks of Sen. Coats) (those &quot;in the business of
providing [patently offensive] material&quot;).  That history leaves
little doubt that if the display provision cannot be given effect
in all of its applications at the present time, Congress at least
would have wanted the restrictions to apply to the display of
indecent material &quot;for commercial purposes,&quot; see 47 U.S.C. 223(b)
(prohibiting indecent telephone communications &quot;for commercial
purposes&quot;).
     As we have explained in Points I and II of the brief, however,
the CDA provisions that appellees challenge are constitutional on
their face in the context of all significant categories of
communication functions now undertaken on the Internet.  The three-
judge district court therefore erred in entering a preliminary
injunction barring enforcement of those provisions in any respect,
especially in this action brought pursuant to a statutory provision
that provides for expedited review only of a challenge to the
constitutionality of a provision of the CDA &quot;on its face.&quot;  Pub. L.
No. 104-104, _ 561(a), 110 Stat. 143.
                            CONCLUSION
     The judgment of the three-judge district court should be
reversed.
     Respectfully submitted.

1.  Unless otherwise noted, references to the CDA are to its
provisions as they will be codified in the United States Code.
2.  Congress also added supplemental restrictions (the control
provisions) that prohibit persons from &quot;knowingly permit[ting] any
telecommunications facility under [their] control to be used for&quot;
for any activity that violates the three primary restrictions.  47
U.S.C. 223(a)(2) and (d)(2).
3.  The prohibitions addressed to interactive computer services
apply to services, other than the Internet, such as bulletin
boards.  47 U.S.C. 230(e); see United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701
(6th Cir.) (discussing bulletin boards), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct.
74 (1996).
4.  After the decision in this case, a three-judge court in the
Southern District of New York issued its own preliminary injunction
against enforcement of the CDA's restrictions on patently offensive
communications.  Shea v. Reno, 930 F. Supp. 916 (1996).  The Shea
court rejected the district court's conclusion in this case that
the CDA's restrictions are unconstitutionally vague, but agreed
with its conclusion that they are unconstitutional under Sable.
The Attorney General's appeal of that preliminary injunction is
also pending before this Court.  Reno v. Shea, No. 96-595 (juris-
dictional statement filed Oct. 15, 1996).
5.  The supplemental control provisions, 47 U.S.C. 223(a)(2)
and (d)(2), are constitutional for the same reasons that the
provisions they supplement are constitutional.  We therefore do not
discuss them further.
6.  Although there is overlap between the transmission and
specific child provisions (both cover the use of computers to send
indecent material when the computers are linked by modems), there
are also some differences in coverage.  The transmission provision
prohibits the use of a telephone or fax machine to transmit
indecent material, while the specific child provision does not.
The latter provision prohibits the use of interactive computers
that are directly linked to other computers to disseminate indecent
material, while the former does not.
7.  The harm to children is exacerbated where access to
indecent material by children is readily permitted, because of the
implied societal approval of the material that accompanies such a
regime.  See Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 642-643 n.10.
8.  Cyberporn Hearing at 7 (Sen. Grassley) (&quot;Congress must give
America's parents a new comfort level in public and commercial
computer networks if these are to be transformed from the private
preserve of a special class of computer hackers into a widely used
communications medium.  This necessary transformation will never
happen if parents abandon the Internet and computer communications
technology remains threatening.&quot;).
9.  Commercial providers of indecent information on multi-user
computer servers that are not connected to the Internet -- such as
electronic bulletin boards -- can also screen for age, since
passwords are ordinarily required to gain access to such a service,
and proof of age (or a valid credit card number) can be requested
before a password is conferred upon a user.  Schmidt Decl. _ 37(a);
Schmidt Exh. 40, at 2 (bulletin board conditioning access on
provision of copy of driver's license or birth certificate).  See
also United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 705 (6th Cir.)
(describing operation of sexually explicit electronic bulletin
board that limited access to members who had provided names, ages,
addresses, phone numbers, and signatures), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct.
74 (1996).
10.  E.g., http://www.thepalace.com (chat service);
http://www.alamak.com/chat/index.html (creation of chat room
through use of a of credit card); http://www.lyris.com. (software
to create discussions and announcement lists).
