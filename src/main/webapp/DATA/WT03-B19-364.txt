Objectives:             
The aim of this course is to develop a conceptual understanding of the 
quantum theory and show how the principles of Quantum Mechanics govern 
the behaviour of a number of modern technological devices. 

Description:            
This unit introduces the concepts of quantum physics with applications 
to examples from atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics.  
Topics covered include the quantisation of energy, the time dependent 
and time independent Schrodinger equation, wave packets, the one 
dimensional potential well problem, the phenomenon of tunnelling.  
The nature of electron spin, Spin-Statistics theorem and Pauli 
exclusion principle, atomic structure and molecular bonding.  
Bonding in amorphous and crystalline solids, Maxwell-Boltzmann and 
Fermi statistics, energy bands and energy gaps, thermal, electrical, 
magnetic and optical properties of solids, Semi-conductor devices, 
Population inversions and lasers, Superconductivity.  
The practicals require the student to repeat some of the classic 
experiments of modern physics such as; the photoelectric effect, 
the Franck-Hertz experiment, Millikan's oil drop experiment, 
electron spin resonance, and the <I>e/m</I> ratio for the electron.

Handbook Entry: 
The lectures in this unit are the same as those in SPH211.  
The practicals require the student to repeat some of the classic 
experiments of modern physics and also study the behaviour of a 
number of semiconductor devices in the electrical engineering 
environment.
