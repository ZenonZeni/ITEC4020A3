COMMERCE'S ROTHKOPF LEAVING

     David J. Rothkopf -- who has been acting Undersecretary of
Commerce for International Trade since the departure of Jeffrey
Garten last October (WTD, 9/29/95) -- yesterday announced he too
is leaving the department later this month.
     Mr. Rothkopf -- who joined Commerce in late 1993 after
having served as chief executive officer of International Media
Partners -- will become the managing director of Kissinger and
Associates, a strategic consulting firm in Washington and New
York.

DRUG MAKERS WANT USTR TO GET TOUGH WITH ARGENTINA

     The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
yesterday called on the US Trade Representative to get tough with
Argentina because of its failure to fulfill promises to
strengthen its intellectual property rights protection laws (WTD,
11/22/95).
     Despite repeated promises to improve the law, patent piracy
in the pharmaceutical sector continues, PhMA President Gerald J.
Mossinghoff wrote US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.  The
lack of movement is costing US drug manufacturers some $500
million a year in lost sales opportunities.
     Mr. Mossinghoff said Argentina "should receive a clear
message -- the US will not accept further procrastination and
failure to enact a new patent protection law.  A comprehensive
strategy -- one that features sustained face-to-face negotiations
with Argentine officials, and the possibility of enforcement
action if talks fail -- should be developed."
     Argentina sits on a less important "special watch list"
under the Section 301 program, the association said.
     In the interim, Argentina has actually passed legislation
that weakens protection of intellectual property rights for all
fields of technology.  "Correcting that problem should be a top
USTR priority in 1996," Mr. Mossinghoff wrote.
