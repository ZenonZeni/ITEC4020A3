<a name="consult"></a>
<p>
<B>IVF Consult:</B>  The IVF doctor will complete a history and physical examination at the time of consultation.  The IVF process and consent forms will be thoroughly reveiwed.  It is helpful to bring copies of your old medical records and hysterosalpingography films, if available.

<a name="mock"></a>
<p><B>Mock Transfer:</B>  A mock trnsfer should be done on a non-IVF cycle, days 1-9 of your cycle.  For the mock transfer, the physician inserts a tiny plastic catheter into the uterus.  This allows the physician to measure the depth and direction of your uterus.  You may experience some cramping during the procedure.  It is recommended that you take Ibuprofen (approximately 600 mgs) 1/2 hour prior to his procedure.  This will reduce the cramping.  if you cannot take Ibuprofen, take 2 Extra-Strenght Tylenol tablets instead.  You may schedule to have this performed at the time of your IVF consult or along with having cervical cultures.
<p>
<a name="eval"></a>
<B>Uterine Cavity and Fallopian Tube Evaluation</B>:  This can be accomplished by 1 of 3 methods:  Hysterosalpingogram (x-ray), Hysteroscopy (endoscopy) or Sonohysterography (ultrasound).  The Physician will determine which procedure is most appropriate for you.  Depending on the results,  you may need more than one type of testing.  The IVF physician will instruct yuo as to when to schedule the procedure.  if you have previously had a hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy the report and films should be reviewed by the physician.<p>

<a name="baseline"></a>
<B>Baseline Bloods:</B>  Serum estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) are to be drawn either day 2 or 3 of your cycle.  Leave your name and number for an IVF call back.  These blood results are helpful to the physician so that hte best IVF stimulation protocol (medication) will be chosen for you to complete your IVF cycle.<p>

<a name="semen"></a>
<B>Semen Freezing:</B>  Once the semen cultures are negative, make an appointment with the Andrology Lab in one of our offices, for a semen freeze appointment.  It is only necessary to freeze a specimen once before the first IVF cycle, unless we use it to inseminate your eggs and you choose to do another cycle.  There is a one time charge of $125 to freeze and sotre a sperm specimen.  This sample is used only as an emergency backup for the day of retrieval.  We prefer to inseminate the eggs with fresh sperm, if possible. 
<p>
<a name="process"></a>
<B>Sperm Processing Panel/ICSI Panel:</B>  After the emen analysis is performed, you will be told by the Andrology lab or a doctor, if the sperm count and/or motility are abnormally low.  in this case, you will be advised to make an appointment to have a Pre-IVF Sperm Processing Panel/ICSI Panel at the Marlton office.  This way, prior to the retrieval, we will have the opportunity to process the specimen and detemine the best method to use to obtain the maximum amount of motile sperm for inseminating the eggs.  It is your responsibility to make this appointment.  Please call the IVF or Andrology Labs if you have questions regarding the pre-IVF sperm processing panel.<p>
<p>
<a name="nurse"></a>
<B>Nursing Consult: </B> A consult with an IVF Nurse should be scheduled by those who need to learn how to administer the injectable medication for the IVF cycle.  There is a fee associated with injection instructions.  By day 1of the retrieval cycle, you should have all of your instructions and medications.  If you do not, you need to call an IVF Nurse.  The direct phone number to reach an IVF nurse is (609) 751-3570 or (215) 635-5518.

<a name="finance"></a>
<p><B>Financial Consult:</B>  Please schedule a consult with the Billing Department Staff to discuss your financial obligations.  A phone consult may be arranged at 1-(800)-752-1086 or (215)635-0877 for your convenience.

<a name="call"></a>
<p><B>Call Backs:</B>  IVF call backs will be made between 4:00PM - 7:00PM on weekdays and from 3:00PM - 6:00PM on Saturdays.  If you will NOT be home, then you must have a telephone answering machine so that we may leave a message regarding your instructions.  If you do not receive a call back by 7:00PM on weekdays or 6:00PM on Saturdays, please contact the answering service in the Marlton, NJ office at (609)751-5575 and ask to speak to the physician on call.

<a name="note"></a>
<p><B>A Personal Note: </B> The process of In Vitro Fertilization can be psychologically stressful.  Significan anxiety and disappointment may occur.  A substantial commitment of time by the couple is needed.  Some people have described the IVF experience as an emotional roller coaster.  The IVF staff of physicians and nurses are well aware of the added stress and burden that the In Vitro process can sometimes create.  We therefore, suggest that you consider joining a support group or participate in a therapy group to help you through this stressful period.  If you would like more information about a group you could join, call LuAnn Vanaman, R.N., C. at the New Jersey office, (609)751-5575.
