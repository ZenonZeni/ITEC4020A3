<TITLE> Marijuana for AIDS Patients...Think Again </TITLE>

<H3>MARIJUANA TO TREAT AIDS PATIENTS?
...THINK AGAIN!
</H3></CENTER>
In The December 1993 issue of High Times Magazine, a reader who signed himself "Doper Professor," complained that after ingesting marijuana-laced "space cakes" he and his wife became "frighteningly high...accompanied by a lot of vomiting...combined with passing in and out of consciousness...which seemed potential life-threatening," adding that a doctor had to be called to give them Valium "to counteract the reaction..."

High Times responded by informing Doper Professor that "determining the desired dose is much harder if one is eating cannabis.  It is not unusual to have a panic reaction."  This would certainly appear to invalidate the claims made by San Francisco's Brownie Mary that her sole reason for possessing 200 pounds of marijuana was that she gives marijuana-laced brownies to AIDS patients to help ease their nausea and vomiting.

One of the world's leading specialists on medical quackery, Victor Herbert, M.D., J.D., of Mount Sinai and Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, wrote of this phenomenon in JAMA in October 1993.  "In some cases," he wrote, "the patient never had the disease.  In others the disease was cured or a remission was induced by genuine therapy, but the quack remedy also given was credited.  In other cases the patient died but was represented as cured.  Sometimes the patient had a spontaneous remission that was publicized as a success, but the proponents failed to keep score and publicize all the failures before and after each 'success.'  The difference between promoters of quack remedies and promoters of legitimate remedies is that only the latter keep score."

An abstract of a recent study on the Impact of tobacco and marijuana use on antioxidants in HIV-1 infected patients by Miguez-Burbano, G Shor-Posner and MK Baum at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Univ. Miami School of Medicine, in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 1994;34:1031, showed that vitamin E levels were significantly lower in marijuana users and cigarette smokers relative to non-users, stating that "The results of this study indicate that both marijuana and cigarettes have a detrimental effect on vitamin E status of HIV-1 infected individuals. These findings are of particular concern in light of the important role of vitamin E in immune processes, inhibition of viral activation, and the death of immune cells."

THOUSANDS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON MARIJUANA HAVE FAILED TO SUBSTANTIATE CLAIMS BY THE PRO-DRUG LOBBY THAT MARIJUANA IS SAFE OR EFFECTIVE FOR ANY MEDICAL INDICATION.
