<img src="../graphics/streetboys.gif" border=0 align=right valign=top><b>And for the lucky Fourth of July door-prize winner...</b>The good ship <b>Diversion,</b> on a recent cruise with 30 aboard, nearly rammed a <b>bloated human corpse</b> floating down Red River. An hour later they nearly rammed it again as they passed it going upriver.<p>

<b>Personally, I'd rather gain my eyesight in Thailand...Al Dematteis</b> went to New York to regain his eyesight. Close sources claim that following two operations he removed the bandages, looked in the mirror, and jumped back.<p>

<b>Wait! Er, may I have your entree?...</b>At the official grand opening for upscale <b>Saigon Prince Hotel,</b> a few hundred of HCMC's bigwigs from business and politics showed up for a fancy dinner. A local Vietnamese moderator kept the bi-lingual crowd jibing. After some speeches, the first course was served, some smoked salmon and soup, followed by scoops of <b>palate-clearing sorbet.</b> Following that and several moments of awkward silence, the moderator, sensing the meal was through, got up and went home, prompting the room to literally half-empty. In Vietnam it is impolite to linger after a formal meal.<p>

<b>You were wondering how to spend your two-week paycheck?...</b>17,000 of Hanoi's soccer-mad paid $10 each to see <b>Italian footballers, Juventus</b>, beat Vietnam's national team 2-1 at recently refurbished Hanoi Stadium. After the win, Juventus teammates shacked up at the equally refurbished <b>Planet Hotel</b>.<p>

<b>And now, for the final installment...</b>We have communicated with HCMC's Nick Elston, who, as was pointed out on this page last time around, is not an employee of timeshare exchange company RCI, as had been reported in state-run Vietnam Investment Review (which, in deference to Mr. Nguyen, recently ran a corrected version of its story). Following is an excerpted <b>clarification written by Mr. Elston,</b> who represents a company called First London Marketing, Ltd., which "works in association with RCI. RCI is an American timeshare exchange company which represents resorts worldwide. The resorts we have introduced to the Vietnamese are all RCI-affiliated. VIR wrongly stated that I was an employee of RCI. My company is contracted by resorts to sell their timeshares and at the same time these resorts are contracted directly with RCI."<p>

<center><img src="doon.gif"></center><br clear><b>BD likes Pho...</b>Earlier in the year <b>Gary Trudeau</b> spent nine days in HCMC and Hanoi, and produced a six-week series on Vietnam. The cartoonist was recently on vacation, so Mr. Nguyen spoke with his syndication editor <b>Lee Salem,</b> who works closely with the satirist. "The main thing that struck Gary was that Ho Chi Minh City was a commercial version of Hong Kong. What struck me is the response we've gotten to the strip. A dozen phone calls, many more letters, nearly all from vets who <b>swear that it's actually their friends</b> in the strip, or that Gary was in their unit during the war. He tries to empathize, but remember, the strip began in the 70's as a counter-culture strip. Normally people get in touch when they don't like his things."<p>

<b>Comings and goings...</b>Hello to <b>Nguyen Quoc Khanh, Shell's</b> new HCMC GM...<b>AMCHAM HCMC's</b> new director <b>Michelle Darken</b>... and to <b>David Kassel, Tom Doan, Meghan Henson, My Hao Nguyen, David Barrus, and Schele Gislason,</b> all University of Michigan students working with <b>Vinacoal</b> and <b>Vietnam Airlines</b> this summer...and to members of <b>Tuck Business School,</b> teaching business classes...and <b>Stanford's Sloan Fellows,</b> 
also in for a late June visit...Singapore-based <b>Stewart Reichenbach</b> of <b>UPS,</b> to HCMC...<b>Rene Tayeb</b> moves from Riverside Apartments in HCMC to <b>Vinataxi</b>...
<b>Sylvie Vu Da,</b> from France to <b>Saigon Prince Hotel</b>...And goodbye to <b>Lisa Jane O'Neil,</b> formerly editor of Vietnam Economic Times, and Bloomberg bureau chief, off to the States...<b>Doug Meehan,</b> formerly with <b>V-Trac</b> and the <b>IFC</b> in Hanoi, off for a philosophy masters at CUNY, LukeMax Co.'s <b>Tony Diep,</b> to Dartmouth's Tuck Business School...<b>Vietnam Fund's Alex Sloan,</b> to Cornell Business School...<b>Felicity Wood,</b> former <b>HCMC AMCHAM</b> head, off to the States for her Ph.D...<b>Ian Wilson</b> of <b>Price Waterhouse</b> in Hanoi, to Manila...<b>David Parker</b> of <b>Bates,</b> off to to Bates-Saatchi & Saatchi, Riad Saudi Arabia... <b>Matthew Gottfried,</b> also of Bates, back to Singapore...<b>Lynette Dowling,</b> who came to HCMC for two months from Australia and stayed two years, returns home...and possibly to HCMC's <b>Melinda Butts,</b> who is presently considering a potential <b>JV</b> with a <b>cow farmer.</b><p>
