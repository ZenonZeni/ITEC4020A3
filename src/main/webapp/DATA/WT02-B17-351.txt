<P>The countries of Mexico and Central
America are more than a land bridge; they form a biological bridge
between the great North and South American continents. The complex
intermingling of northern temperate and southern tropical gene
pools has created the region's extraordinarily rich biodiversity.
 The impressive diversity and endemism of the Sea of Cortez stems
from its subtropical conditions and its isolated position between
Baja California and mainland Mexico. 

<P>Yet accelerating rates of
forest and marine destruction, growing populations, and economic
pressures are prompting political leaders throughout the region
to move toward new approaches of sustainable development.  CI
is working with rural communities to help them utilize forest,
marine, and other natural resources in ways that foster long-term
ecological health instead of devastation.  And to protect the
last great tropical forests of Central America, CI is bringing
together governments to work together on protecting habitats that
span national boundaries.   

<P>The extensive Maya Tropical Forest
covering southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and Belize is one
case in point.  In August 1995, CI worked with the U.S. Man and
the Biosphere Directorate to bring together representatives from
Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize to assess the state of the Maya
Tropical Forest -- the largest lowland forest in Central America
-- shared by the three countries.  At this conference, 75 scientists,
conservationists, and government officials produced a trinational
action plan for the forest's conservation and sustainable development.
 This marks the first time that three nations have come together
in cooperative management of an ecosystem of this magnitude. 

<P>A
subsequent CI-sponsored summit has led to action in another important
protected area in the Maya Mountains on the Guatemala/Belize border.
 Working with partners in both countries, CI was able to bring
together government officials and conservationists for the first
binational agreements on the future of the Chiquibul Forest and
the river the two nations share.  In November 1995, Guatemala
announced the creation of the 83,000-hectare Chiquibul Biosphere
Reserve to mirror the Chiquibul National Park across the border
in Belize.  Together, the two areas protect the Chiquibul River
watershed, which is vital to both countries.  With 80 percent
of northern Guatemala's border with Belize under protected area
status, one of the most important regions in Mexico and Central
America for migratory birds is secure.
