PENA APPROVES MAJORITY OF LAX LANDING FEE INCREASES

     U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena's finding that
much of Los Angeles International Airport's proposed landing fee
increase is reasonable marks a milestone for the airport, but also
seems destined to propel the dispute into the halls of Congress. The
Dec. 22 decision could also reverberate in city halls across the
country.
     LAX has been involved in a series of disputes with carriers over
the legitimacy of certain landing fees. Airlines claim the fees are a
subtle form of revenue diversion, in which airlines are forced to pay
for some non-airport safety services. This is not allowed under
federal law. Pena's decision reinstates some services paid for by
airline fees that carriers contend are not airport related.
     Tensions concerning the decision were evident in statements made
by Airport Commission President Ted Stein, who was quoted by the L.A.
Times as saying the airlines "basically conceded this time that they
got their butts kicked."
     Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association, which
represents U.S. airlines, appears to be in a fighting mood as well.
"The time has come for city hall to end its shenanigans," she says,
claiming that by virtue of these landing fees, Los Angeles area
citizens are paying "hidden taxes." She says the DOT's decision "pays
lip service to the congressional mandate prohibiting cities. . .from
diverting airport revenues to pay for general public services. We are
left with no choice but to go back to Congress for the second time in
three years to get this mess cleaned up."
     Chris Chiames, spokesman for ATA, says his organization will try
to change the decision-making process to isolate it from political
pressures, which Chiames believes influenced Pena. ATA also wants to
strengthen the language in federal laws that prevent revenue diversion
to avoid similar situations from arising at other U.S. airports.
"There are dozens of cash-strapped cities and counties across the
country" that might be tempted to follow in Los Angeles' footsteps,
Chiames suggests.
     The FAA's reauthorization bill will expire next fall, and Chiames
views this occasion "as a vehicle to revisit the issue."
     The airport's landing fees will be scaled back to $1.97 from the
current $2.06 per thousand pounds of landed weight. Another 29 cents
is currently under dispute by the airlines, who continue "to pay that
amount while awaiting judicial resolution.
     Pena's decision rejects part of an earlier ruling made by
administrative law judge Burton S. Kolko in late November. [WAW, Dec.
5, 1995, p. 8] At that time, Kolko found 14 cents of the $2.06 landing
fees unreasonable. Pena's decision, however, reinstated five cents of
the amount in question. The airport must refund airlines the
difference between the $2.06 and $1.97 charges, which amounts to $4.6
million. If all 14 cents of the landing fees had been disallowed, as
the airlines wanted, the airport would have been forced to refund $7.2
million.

NEW YORK SEES SAVINGS IN OUTSOURCING

     The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is turning to
private industry to help reduce operating costs at Newark
International Airport, as part of an overall restructuring that will
save the Authority $105 million in 1996. 
     The Authority will expand the role of private developers in
managing terminal concessions at Newark and increase the use of
private contractors and consultants to undertake design and management
of capital projects. There will be more outside bidding for
maintenance contracts to foster competition. Finally, there will be
opportunities for the duty-free shopping industry as Newark plans to
expand its facilities to meet growing international passenger
traffic.                                                              
     Combined with moves to reduce airport administrative costs and
overtime, the Authority expects to save more than $10 million at
Newark in 1996, with additional annual savings of $16 million in the
future. 
     "We expect to increase Newark Airport's net revenues to the Port
Authority," says the Authority's Executive Director, George J. Marlin.
"At the same time, we will improve customer service and facility
maintenance," he adds.
     The recommendations made for Newark may also be applied to JFK
and LaGuardia airports, says Lewis M. Eisenberg, chairman of the
Authority. The recommendations were part of a study conducted by Leigh
Fisher Associates in conjunction with KPMG Peat Marwick, Mitchell
Titus & Co. and Anita T. Connor, Inc.

BAA AIRPORTS REPORT AVERAGE PASSENGER INCREASE OF 6.8% IN NOVEMBER

     Traffic at the seven airports operated by BAA rose 6.8% in
November to 6.5 million passengers, compared to the same period one
year ago. BAA's three London-area facilities - Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted - matched that growth rate and handled 5.7 million passengers
during the same period. Gatwick passenger volume jumped 9.3%, Stansted
rose 44% and Heathrow increased 4%.
     Aircraft movements rose 4.1% at the seven airports, led by a 21%
increase at Stansted and 10% rise at Gatwick. Southampton movements
dropped nearly 6% in November, while Heathrow recorded an increase of
under 1%. Aircraft movements for the entire system totalled 73,154
last month.
     Cargo showed moderate growth of 6.4% to 123,446 metric tons, led
by Stansted, up 12.8%, and Heathrow, up 7.8%. Declines were posted at
Gatwick 
(-1.5%), Glasgow (-12.3%) and Edinburgh (-20.1%).

AFCO FINALIZING AIR CARGO PLANS WITH PITTSBURGH

     Aviation Facilities Management (AFCO), McLean, Va., is in the
process of refining its air cargo marketing plan for Pittsburgh
International Airport, which wants to expand its cargo operations in
part at the expense of other eastern seaboard facilities. AFCO, which
signed a contract with the airport in October, expects to complete the
plan this week. 
     AFCO's "initial focus" will be to attract all-cargo and small
package carriers, which can immediately provide additional lift
capacity, says Tom Samuels, AFCO's project manager. The company is in
discussion  with several such carriers to join FedEx, Airborne Express
and UPS, which currently operate out of Pittsburgh. AFCO will also
seek business from passenger carriers with belly space, Samuels says.
     AFCO also wants to reverse a trend in which "millions of pounds"
of cargo are trucked from the Pittsburgh area to other eastern
seaboard airports for transport. That trend developed from
insufficient cargo lift out of Pittsburgh, he says. AFCO also expects
natural increases in cargo tonnage from the market trend in the United
States, which is expected to double over the next 12-15 years.

CHEK LAP KOK CONTRACTS GO TO HONG KONG, JAPANESE FIRMS

     Hong Kong's Airport Authority awarded two contracts in late
December, including the last major construction project for Chek Lap
Kok Airport.
     Nishimatsu Construction Co. received a $225.7 million contract to
complete the ground transportation center (GTC) that will contain a
railway station and other public transport facilities. Nishimatsu will
build the structure, railway works, roads, and electrical substation,
a switching station and an emergency generator plant room. In
conjunction with this contract, the Mass Transit Railway Corp. signed
an entrustment agreement with the Authority to reimburse the latter
for the a significant portion of the GTC costs.
     Also, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL) won the contract to
operate the air cargo terminal at Chek Lap Kok Airport. A second
franchise agreement with Asia Airfreight Terminal Co. Ltd. to operate
a second terminal is expected shortly. HACTL, which has the monopoly
to operate the air cargo facility at existing Kai Tak Airport, will be
responsible for the 320,000-square-foot facility that can handle up to
2.6 million tons annually.

GREINER TO BUILD NEW RUNWAY AT SKY HARBOR

     Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport has selected Greiner
to construct a 7,800-foot-long runway and parallel taxiway system in a
contract that could be worth as much as $2.4 million, pending
negotiations and approval of the Phoenix City Council in January. The
contract also involves four new, high-speed exit taxiways, aircraft
run-up pad, Cat I computer-controlled lighting, glide slope, and MALSR
(medium-intensity approach lighting system with runway alignment
indicator lights). The existing FAA glide slope will be relocated, and
airfield lighting and guidance signs will be installed. Construction
is anticipated to begin in 1997, with a completion date in 1999.

CHARLOTTE-DOUGLAS TDWR UP AND RUNNING EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED

     Spurred by a fatal airplane crash in July 1994, the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration has installed and made fully operational a $5
million terminal Doppler weather radar (TDWR) at Charlotte-Douglas
International Airport, Charlotte, N.C.
     The system was not scheduled to be operational until mid-1996,
but the crash of a USAir Boeing 737, which resulted in 37 deaths,
raised safety concerns. The crash has been attributed to a "massive
microburst" by testifiers at National Transportation Safety Board
meetings.

BRAZILIAN AIRPORT EMBARKS ON $12 MILLION CARGO EXPANSION PLAN 

     The airport authority responsible for Guarulhos Airport in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, has approved a $12 million cargo expansion plan to
relieve problems that have plagued the facility [WAW, Sept. 26,]. 
     Construction at the airport has already begun, including
expanding import and export facilities, as well as improving the
computer system and security at the airport, says Infraero, the
government-
owned handling company. Brazilian company Camargo Correa/Constram was
awarded the expansion contract, which is to be completed in April. 
     Significant strides have also been taken to improve cargo
handling at the facility, although delays in cargo clearance still
exist. "I couldn't believe I was in the same airport," says Mike
Nenadovich, IATA facilities manager, days after his second visit to
Guarulhos Airport. Nenadovich first visited the airport in April and
wrote a scathing report on numerous problems there. 
     "The place was not busting at the seams," Nenadovich says, but
Infraero has made strides to move and store cargo more efficiently. It
is the customs authority that continues to delay cargo, Nenadovich
says. Infraero now claims that 100% of cargo is checked into a
warehouse within 12 hours of arrival. It is then turned over to
customs.
     The weak link is still MANTRA, Brazilian Customs's computer
system, he says. "You are unable to correct a typo on [airway bills
required by customs]. You must make an appointment and the customs
agent has to go in and fix it. The whole purpose of [electronic data
interchange] is to get it done and to get it done fast. Why have EDI
if you have to make appointments to make changes?" he asks. Customs
officials admitted that some problems exist, Nenadovich says, noting
they would like IATA's help in improving the system. Nenadovich says
he currently is reviewing possible system enhancements. 
     Although airline representatives at Guarulhos tell Nenadovich
they have lost business equaling more than 4,000 pounds of cargo to
other area airports, he contends "the new management of Infraero has
done a marvelous job." Cargo was not out on the ramp, as it was in
April. All cargo is now stored in a highly-secured warehouse and the
airport has installed 60 computerized security cameras to monitor all
activity at the airport. A fence has been constructed around the
airport, restricting all traffic to one entrance and exit and
additional off-airport facilities are being built to accommodate
freight forwarders, he adds.
