<P>Our patient care coordinator, <EM>Melissa, </EM>is a
registered nurse who joined us this year after two years as
the IVF Nurse Coordinator at Women's health Care and
Reproductive Services in Ft. Meyers. Melissa has replaced
Nancy, our IVF Nurse Coordinator since 1988, who joined her
husband when he was transferred to Atlanta. Melissa was
chosen for the position because of her knowledge of IVF and
her warm and sweet personality, which makes every aspect of
the IVF experience more pleasant for our patients.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Our LPN's are <EM>Kelly</EM> and <EM>Susan</EM>. Kelly
has been a nurse since 1990 and has been with the Fertility
Institute of Boca Raton since 1993. Susan joined us a year
ago after three years at a Miami infertility center and seven
years in general nursing. Both Kelly and Susan personify the
warmth and kindness that set the Fertility Institute of Boca
Raton apart as a special place.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>

himself available to help guide our patients through the
process of determining coverage and receiving
reimbursement.</P>
