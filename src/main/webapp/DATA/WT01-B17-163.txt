       <b><i>Reversing Hot Flashes with Flower Essences</i><br>
       <tt>By Patricia Kaminski</tt></b>
       <p>

As a flower essence counselor, my approach to menopause is unconventional. While I may recommend herbal and nutritional supplements or work in tandem with other health professionals such as an acupuncturist or nutritionist, I have found that flower essences can play a major role in resolving menopausal transitions by addressing the deep emotional and psychological issues women face during this life change. <p>
Herbal and nutritional supplements can help reduce the physical symptoms, but it is also vitally important to help each woman understand her own body’s expressions as carrying a larger message about her life. In my experience, when the body is understood from this larger perspective, women do more than adjust to or reverse uncomfortable menopausal symptoms. Instead, they develop depth and maturity and can move confidently toward menopause as a positive part of their life, as Alice’s case demonstrates.<p>

<b>RAPID ONSET OF MENO-PAUSE.</b><p>
Alice, aged 48, entered rapidly into full-blown menopausal symptoms with little warning. She was a highly successful career woman who married late and had her first child when she was 44. <p>
But rather than fully enjoying her young daughter, Alice found herself completely exhausted and in emotional turmoil. She suffered from debilitating hot flashes and drenching night sweats. In addition, she developed urinary incontinence, making it difficult to get adequate rest at night. After nursing her child, Alice’s periods became scanty and irregular for one year, then ceased altogether.<p>
In response to these conditions, her conventional doctor prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but after 6 months, Alice sought an alternative treatment. While on HRT, her hot flashes and night sweats subsided, but Alice developed many PMS-like symptoms—bloating, tender breasts, bouts of nausea and weight gain—and she still had bladder control problems at night. She reported feeling even more tense and moody than before, and generally exhausted. <p>
When I first saw Alice, our immediate goal was to wean her from the HRT, which was creating havoc in her body. We used an herbal formula consisting of black cohosh (Cimifuga racemosa), dong quai (Angelica sinensis), and chasteberry (Vitex agnus castus). I also recommended that Alice add a combination of evening primrose, black currant, and borage oils to her diet along with increasing her consumption of calcium-rich foods such as dark leafy greens. <p>

	These changes helped Alice cope without synthetic hormones, although her hot flashes and night sweats returned in a diminished form.<p>
	I began flower essence therapy with a single remedy called Scarlet Monkeyflower. This would help her address the sensation of hot flashes and night sweats from a deeper level. To see how this is possible, it’s helpful to know something about the plant from which the flower essence is made. <p>

<b>INSIDE THE EMOTIONS OF THE HOT FLASH.</b><p>
As a plant, Scarlet Monkeyflower is a bright red flower with many fiery qualities, yet it grows in a shady environment near flowing streams. As we understand its operation in flower essence therapy, this plant can help to bring deep primal feelings of anger or other forms of “raw fire” into more harmonious or flowing expression.<p>
With the help of Scarlet Monkeyflower, Alice was able to stop resisting her symptoms and move toward them, and to begin to experience their inner meaning and purpose for the first time. Flower essences help to clarify emotions and bring insight into their origin and purpose. <p>
In her journal, Alice wrote: “I felt a burning wave of energy pass over my body from below, spreading upwards until my neck was red hot and my skin prickled. I could breathe into them as though they were labor pains. I began to feel as if I were giving birth to some new part of myself.” On one occasion she awoke from a night sweat and recalled an intense dream during which she was expressing anger toward her mother. <p>
As the days passed, she uncovered many painful memories and emotions. “I feel now as though a flame is burning in me, purifying and illumining me, helping me to see many emotions which I have repressed for a long time,” Alice wrote. Although others had always seen her as a “helper” and a “pleaser,” Alice felt that “inside, another part of me is ready to explode.”<p>
As she assimilated the “message” of the Scarlet Monkeyflower in terms of her emotional insights over the next 2 months, her hot flashes and night sweats subsided, for the most part, along with her frequent urination. More predominant now were symptoms of deep fatigue, punctuated by brief bouts of nervous hyperactivity. <p>

<b>HELPED BY A ROSE AND A LILY.</b><p>
At this point, I developed a flower essence combination that combined plant remedies from the lilies and roses. With their affinity to water and their round bulbs with shallow roots, the lilies have long been associated in herbal (and artistic) tradition with the feminine. On the other hand, the roses have deep roots and sharp thorns, and can help make changes in a person’s masculine qualities. In flower essence theory, the quality, nature, setting, and growth patterns of plants are taken to be clues as to the kind of healing effects they might have when taken as flower essences.<p>
The flower essences selected for Alice included Tiger Lily, which helps to stabilize the masculine elements within a woman’s psyche, and Mariposa Lily. This essence addresses issues of mothering and nurturance, such as relatedness to one’s own mother or doubts about one’s ability to be a mother. Alice had many internal conflicts that came to the surface in raising her daughter. <p>
Another remedy I gave Alice was Alpine Lily to help her sustain and heal the biological demands of late motherhood and to stay aware of the physical expressions of her body rather than denying or masking them as she tended to do. The rose flower essences included California Wild Rose, which brings renewed vitality and enthusiasm by giving one a new sense of passion or vision for one’s life; Quince, a remedy often recommended for those with a “helper or pleaser” personality, by giving more strength and firmness to one’s expressions; and Blackberry, a remedy that helps to strengthen the will. <p>
I also prepared these essences in a base of Self-Heal cream, to which was added several drops of pure rose essential oil. Alice massaged this formula twice daily onto her heart and chest area. She took 4 drops sublingually of each flower essence 4 times daily, upon rising, before lunch and dinner, and before going to bed. <p>

<b>RENEWED ENERGY AND PURPOSE.</b><p>
During the 3 months in which she used these flower essences, Alice experienced profound changes in her body and emotions. She no longer felt exhausted. She spent more time at home with her daughter. In her relationship with her husband she became more openly expressive rather than stifling her resentments. She developed new career plans, for teaching and consulting. <p>
She also enrolled in an art course which helped her to find expression for the new parts of herself the flower essences had helped to uncover. Most surprisingly, her menstrual period returned and has been regular for 2 years. “I used to feel annoyed by my period and couldn’t wait for it to be over,” Alice told me. Now she welcomes it. <p>
About a year after using these essences, Alice reported she felt like an entirely different person. “I don’t want to see menopause as ‘fixing’ my biological clock. I have gone through a dark tunnel and come out the other side. I have never felt more excited about my future.”<p>
