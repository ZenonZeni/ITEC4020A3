<h1>The Wootton Report</h1>

<p><b>Extract from 'The Strange Case of Pot' by Michael Schofield
(Penguin, 1971). </b></p>

<hr>

<p>Schofield was a social psychologist who sat on the Wootton
Committee and, dismayed by its reception, which led to the
introduction of the Misuse of Drugs Act, he subsequently
published this book. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the introduction, he writes: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The original title of this book was to have been 'The
    Case For And Against Pot.' It was intended to present both
    sides of the controversy and weight the evidence before
    coming to a conclusion. But once the myths were cleared, it
    became obvious that the case for and against was not evenly
    balanced. By any ordinary standards of objectivity, it is
    clear that cannabis is not a very harmful drug. But the
    simple ranging of issues side by side is to superficial an
    approach for what is a very complex situation - really a
    social problem, much less a legal problem, and still less a
    medical problem.' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The book is divided into three major parts. In the first
    five chapters I present the basic information about cannabis
    and compare it with the other illegal drugs. In the next six
    chapters I try to explain the public attitudes to cannabis
    and discuss the main controversies. In the last five chapters
    I attempt to describe the legal and sociological aspects, and
    end by suggesting a more sensible plan of action.' </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 7, The Wootton Report</h2>

<p>- In this chapter, Schofield discusses the background to the
establishment of the Wootton Committee and then goes on to
outline the committee's recommendations, elucidating each one. </p>

<h3>Other Reports</h3>

<p>At first Government committees were only concerned with the
opiates, and in particular with heroin addiction. The two reports
of the Interdepartmental Committee under Lord Brain in 1961 and
1965 hardly mentioned cannabis. In the first report the committee
decided that cannabis was not within their terms of reference and
concluded: 'In our view cannabis is not a drug of addiction; it
is an intoxicant.' In the second report they noted briefly that
there is 'a risk that young people may be persuaded to turn to
cannabis' which was something of an understatement even in 1965. </p>

<p>One important recommendation in the second Brain report was to
set up a Standing Advisory Committee to keep under review the
whole problem of drug dependence. As this was not a static but a
changing problem, it would be useful to bring together a group of
experts with authority to advise to advise on the social as well
as the medical aspects. This committee was set up in early 1967
under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Wayne, MD, PhD, DSc, FRCP,
FRCP(G). Twenty-two other members were appointed, nine of whom
were doctors. A small secretariat was formed to help the
committee, but there was no money to pay for research and no
special facilities. Some of the members were doctors treating
addicts, but most of them had only a limited amount of knowledge
of drugs although all of them have learnt over the years. </p>

<p>Without the facilities to initiate or carry out research, this
committee cannot be expected to provide new facts or make
important discoveries. All that the members can do is to discuss
the matter between themselves and listen from time to time to
witnesses called to give evidence because they are experts in
some particular aspect of drug use. But nearly everyone who gives
evidence to this committee does so as the representative of an
organisation which has a special interest in drugs. Conflicting
views will be heard from the representatives of other
organisations. The function of the committee is essentially
judicial and its purpose is to reconcile the conflicting claims
of its witnesses. As there is a wide variety of opinion
represented among the members, the suggested solutions to the
various problems of drug dependence are obtained by compromising
between opposing views. The reports which are issued from time to
time usually consist of an aggregation of existing opinions.
including those of the chairman, the committee members, and the
witnesses. A research team of three or four people working full
time is more likely to produce more penetrating and workable
solutions to the problems of drug use than a committee of
prominent citizens meeting three or four times a year to compile
and select from conflicting expert opinions. </p>

<p>None the less the committee has been able to give useful
advice to the Home Office and Ministry of Social Security on the
best way to implement the earlier recommendations of the Brain
committee. Treatment centres for heroin addicts have been set up
and special arrangements were introduced to control the outbreak
of methedrine injections. Perhaps the most important work has
been done in the sub-committees which have met more regularly
than the main committee. There have been sub-committees on
rehabilitation (published as a report by HMSO in 1969) and health
education (the results were circularised by the Department of
Education), amphetamines, LSD, and the powers of search and
arrest (these reports were published by HMSO in 1970). In April
1967 a special sub-committee was appointed to review the
available evidence on the pharmacological, clinical,
pathological, social and legal aspects of cannabis. After
seventeen meetings under the chairmanship of Baroness Wootton,
the sub-committee's report was published in January 1969. </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Recommendations</h2>

<p><b>(1) We recommend that in the interest of public health, it
is necessary for the time being to maintain restrictions on the
availability of cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- Although it is stated in the report that the consumption of
cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful effects, the committee
felt less sure about the mental effects. This recommendation,
therefore, is intended to be a temporary measure and should be
reviewed from time to time, when more is known about the effects
as a result of medical and social research. Meanwhile the courts
should recognise that there is considerable variation in the
personalities and motives of people who use cannabis. </p>

<p><b>(2) Every encouragement, both academic and financial,
should be given to suitable projects for enquiry into the
cannabis problem.</b> </p>

<p>- It follows that if there is a lack of information on an
important and controversial problem, every effort should be made
to provide research facilities. Although three working parties
have been set up by the medical Research Council and an Institute
for the Study of Drug Dependence has been established, progress
is very slow. It is inevitable that research into drug use will
be a lengthy business, but it is disquieting that even three
years after the formation of the Government's Advisory Committee,
very few large-scale research projects have even been started. </p>

<p>In March 1970, the Home Office issued a list of research on
drug dependence. This list contained ten biochemical and
pharmacological studies, mainly concerned with the developments
of techniques for detecting cannabis in the body. there were no
cannabis studies listed under the clinical and treatment section.
Five studies were listed under the social and psychological
section; three of these (Chapple, 1966; Paton, 1968; Tylden,
1968) who had written papers strongly opposed to the use of
cannabis even before starting the research; only one of the five
has been undertaken by a sociologist. so far the Social Science
Research Council has not supported any researches on the use of
cannabis even though it is in the area of sociology that we most
need information. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee found that it was impossible to estimate
the number of people who used cannabis and the guesses seem to
range between 30,000 and 300,000. It is clearly impossible to
make sense of statements about the social consequences of
widespread use of cannabis until there are some reliable
estimates of the prevalence of regular users. No detailed
information is available about the extent of cannabis use by
immigrants. There is an immediate need for sociological and
psychological studies to define the different social groups and
to describe the personalities of people who smoke cannabis.
People do not hesitate to criticise the young for taking drugs,
but in fact no one knows how many adolescents do take cannabis,
how many use the drug only occasionally at parties and week-ends,
and how many take it regularly. Only a well-planned research
would show if there are differentiating characteristics between
users who take only cannabis and people who used to take cannabis
but have now given up all drug use. </p>

<p><b>(3) The law should progressively be recast to give
Parliament greater flexibility of control over individual drugs.</b>
</p>

<p>- This was one of the few recommendations which the Home
Secretary found acceptable, although it seems likely that he does
not interpret the 'greater flexibility of control' in the same
sense as the Wootton Committee. Mr Callaghan, speaking during the
debate on the Wootton report, said that he would put before the
House proposals which would give him more power to handle the
problem in a much more flexible manner. He then went on to
criticise the restrictions of the 1964 Drugs Act which in fact
does not apply to cannabis. He wanted the power to bring new
synthetic drugs under the Act as they were developed and became
popular with users, and he also mentioned the need to have
stronger legal control over manufacturers, doctors, chemists, and
others who distribute the drugs. he felt that there was 'a clear
risk that each new fashion of drug taking will find new gaps in
the defences, which will only be plugged too late' and the
solution would be 'to have a single comprehensive code which
would rationalise and strengthen the Government's powers.'
(Quoted from Hansard, 27 January, 1969, column 967). There is
much substance in Mr Callaghan's remarks about changing fashions
in the drugs scene but this has nothing to do with the Wootton
report which is about cannabis, a drug that is already
fashionable and is hardly ever prescribed by medical men. It is
difficult to see what the Home Secretary's call for new
legislation has to do with cannabis unless he feels that one drug
is much like another, an attitude of mind that Lady Wootton and
her colleagues were most anxious to alter. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee suggested changes in the law because
there is now a better understanding of the reasons why people use
drugs. Criminological studies have cast doubts on the
effectiveness of deterrents and the general law on the treatment
of offenders has been changed considerable. The committee felt
that 'the penalties for cannabis offences have gone unreviewed
for too long'. Their idea of flexibility was that the law should
be adjusted according to the dangers of the drug and the way it
is misused. </p>

<p><b>(4) The association in legislation of cannabis and heroin
and the other opiates is inappropriate and new legislation to
deal specifically and separately with cannabis and its synthetic
derivatives should be introduced as soon as possible.</b> </p>

<p>- There are two reasons for this. Many people agree that the
confusion between cannabis and heroin leads to misunderstandings
and, in some cases, to injustice. The committee also stated quite
clearly that the present penalties for possession of cannabis
were altogether too high. The Government accepted the third
recommendation for reasons other than those given by the
committee, and after some hesitation, the fourth recommendation
was also incorporated into the new (Misuse of Drugs) Bill,
although the penalties for possession of cannabis are still
severe. </p>

<p><b>(5) Unlawful possession of cannabis without knowledge
should not be an offence. The practicability of distinguishing
between possession intended for use and possession intended for
supply should be examined.</b> </p>

<p>- This brings to notice two of the several difficulties
encountered in a law which is about possession when what we are
really concerned about is the misuse of drugs. Although a recent
test case was taken as far as the House of Lords the resulting
decision was by no means clear because the issues in that
particular case were complex. The law should make it quite
certain that a person cannot be incriminated, for example, by
someone putting cannabis in his coat pocket without his
knowledge. The police maintain that is extremely difficult to
catch someone in the act of dealing in cannabis or any other
drug. The unsatisfactory solution to this problem under the 1965
Act was to retain high maximum penalties for the offence of
possession so that the courts could sentence a man who had been
found guilty of one offence (i.e. possession) as if he has been
found guilty of another (i.e. supply). It is a form of justice
that is open to question, it is a bit like the bench saying to a
motorist: 'You have been caught exceeding the speed limit and we
have been told that you had been drinking rather heavily;
however, we can't prove that you were drunk, so we are going to
give you a very heavy sentence for speeding.' The proposals for
the new legislation allow this practise to continue: although the
new offence of 'possession with intent to supply' is introduced,
a maximum penalty of five years for the possession of cannabis is
proposed. It is difficult to imagine a situation where the simple
possession of cannabis deserves such a severe sentence. The new
Bill distinguishes between possession and trafficking and
increases the penalty for selling cannabis to a maximum of
fourteen years. This reflects the public demand for heavy
penalties for traffickers which is based on a misunderstanding of
the role of the dealer. Nevertheless if a man is making money out
of selling an illegal substance, it is reasonable to expect him
to be dealt with more severely than someone who is merely using
the drug. </p>

<p><b>(6) Possession of a small amount of cannabis should not
normally be regarded as a serious crime to be punished by
imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- This is a very radical recommendation and one which caused a
large amount of adverse comment in the press. But informed
opinion is coming round to the idea that prison is not a sensible
way to treat people who wish to use cannabis. What even informed
opinion found it difficult to take was the explicit statement
that possession in not a serious crime. But the committee went
still further in paragraph 90 of the report, where they state
that prison is the wrong place even for those who supply on a
limited scale. they do not attempt to define what they mean by a
limited scale, but even a fairly strict definition would include
about nine out of ten of the transactions between users and
sellers because the amounts involved are so small. </p>

<p><b>(7) The offence of unlawful possession, sale or supply of
cannabis should be punishable on summary conviction with a fine
not exceeding £100, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding
four months, or both such fine and imprisonment. On conviction or
indictment the penalty should be an unlimited fine, or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both such fine
and imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- Thus the committee recommended considerable reductions in
the penalties. The penalties for possession under the 1965 Act in
force when the committee reported, the penalties in the new Bill
and the penalties recommended in the Wootton report are
summarised as follows: </p>

<pre>
<font size="2">Maximum         1965 Act                1970 Bill               Wootton penalties                                                               Report
Summary conviction:
Fine                    £250            £400            £100 Imprisonment    12 months               6 months                4 months
Indictment:
Fine                    £1,000          unlimited               unlimited Imprisonment    10 years                5 years         2 years</font>
</pre>

<p>Some members of the committee argued strongly against any kind
of prison sentence for simple possession, but in the end were
persuaded to agree to a maximum penalty of four months
imprisonment because this sentence would allow the defendant the
option of going for trial by jury and also because a prison
sentence gives the judiciary the chance to deal with what the
committee called 'difficult individual cases'. The committee were
aware that a substantial part of the smuggling of cannabis is in
small amounts (paragraph 37) and is not exploited to any
significant extent by professional criminals (paragraph 38).
Therefore they expected that most cases would be dealt with
summarily by imposing a small fine. the reaction to this showed
that it was a most unpopular recommendation. The home secretary
and the opposition spokesman on Home Affairs both said that this
recommendation would make it appear that Parliament was condoning
the smoking of cannabis. ('If we were to adopt what is proposed
or started to take a namby-pampy attitude about it, we should
need our heads examined. I range myself wholeheartedly behind the
Home Secretary on this issue.' Quentin Hogg in Hansard, 27
January 1969, column 957) </p>

<p><b>(8) The existing law which inhibits research requiring the
smoking of cannabis (section 5, Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965) should
be amended to allow qualified workers to study its use both by
observation and by laboratory and social experiments.</b> </p>

<p>- There has been considerable uncertainty about the smoking of
cannabis for research purposes with the result that no serious
study has been made in this country on the effects of smoking on
humans, even in laboratory conditions. As the social factors are
even more important than the pharmacological problems, it is
essential that researchers should be free to study these
phenomena by observations and experiments outside as well as
inside the laboratory without the risk of prosecution. Although
the Home Secretary gave the lack of information as the reason for
rejecting many of the recommendations in the Wootton Report, it
was notable that he never mentioned this in the House of Commons.
In fact this was one of the earliest and most urgent of the
suggestions made by the full Standing Advisory committee, long
before the Wootton report was published. Many members realised
that their work was hindered by the shortage of information that
could only be obtained by fairly elaborate and lengthy research.
It was suggested that a short Bill should be put before
Parliament to make research on cannabis possible without the risk
of prosecution. It was thought that such a bill would not arouse
much opposition, but the Home Office advisors to the committee
felt that this plan was not practical. They maintained that for a
short Bill on the subject of research into cannabis could not be
confined to this subject and far-reaching amendments would be
added during its passage through Parliament. so it was decided to
wait until the Government was ready to introduce comprehensive
legislation into which a special clause would be included to
allow bona fide research workers to investigate the effects of
smoking cannabis. But in fact three years have been lost between
the time when the law on cannabis research might have been
changed and the introduction of this new legislation. It is
possible that much useful information could have been obtained in
that time, information which would have been invaluable during
the preparation of the new Bill and the subsequent discussion of
various proposals. </p>

<p><b>(9) Section 5 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965 (permitting
premises to be used for smoking cannabis, etc.) should be
redefined in scope so as to apply to premises open to the public,
to exclude the reference to dealing in cannabis and cannabis
resin, and to remove the absolute nature of the liability on
managers.</b> </p>

<p>- This recommendation has been partly approved by the Home
Secretary in the proposals for new legislation so that occupiers
and managers commit an offence if they knowingly permit a drug to
be used or sold in their premises. This will obviate the
liability of the landlord of private premises who would have been
convicted under the old law even if he was able to show that he
did not know that pot was being smoked in his house. But the Home
Secretary has rejected the suggestion that this should only be an
offence in public premises. </p>

<p><b>(10) The Advisory Committee should undertake, as a matter
of urgency, a review of police powers of arrest and search in
relation to drug offences generally, with a view to advising the
Secretary of State on any changes that may be appropriate in the
law, particularly as regards cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- The Wootton committee seemed to think this task was too big
for them because they felt that the question of police powers
could not be realistically considered in relation to cannabis
alone. But there is no doubt that this is a most important issue.
There is a growing public concern about the way the police are
using their powers of search and arrest and many youth workers
see this as one of the main causes of the substantial
deterioration in the relations between young people and the
police. It may be said that this recommendation is a bit timid.
In a large numbers of cases, the police search for drugs in
general, but this is not true of every case. There must be
occasions when the reasonable grounds for suspicion relate only
to the use of cannabis; for example, it is the only drug that has
a pungent smell. the very extensive police powers of search and
arrest, which may be necessary for the more harmful drugs, are
difficult to justify for cannabis, the possession of which,
according to the report, is a relatively minor offence. This
recommendation was thought to be 'a matter of urgency' and a new
sub-committee under the chairmanship of William Deedes was set up
soon after the Wootton report was published. In an early debate
on drugs Mr Deedes said in the House of Commons: 'It makes no
sense for the police to go round raiding and stripping young
people at parties to find drugs, some of which their elders treat
as a staple diet. the posture against the young becomes morally
untenable.' But his report turned out to be rather a
disappointing document, with few positive recommendations. </p>

<p><b>(11) The development of the manufacture of synthetic
cannabinols should be kept under review and, if necessary,
control should be imposed under powers provided by the Pharmacy
and Poisons Act, 1933, and The Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act,
1964.</b> </p>

<p>- Much progress is being made in the pharmacological study of
cannabis and the active ingredient has been synthesised. It is
possible that synthetic pot will be available in large quantities
before long, and this substance is likely to be purer and safer,
and perhaps more potent, than the product obtained from the
plant. Such a substance would not be covered by the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1965, but the proposed legislation would make it
possible to add new products of the pharmacological industry to
the schedule of restricted drugs simply by regulations placed
before the two Houses of Parliament. </p>

<p><b>(12) Preparations of cannabis and its derivatives should
continue to be available on prescription for purposes of medical
treatment and research. Provision should be made in legislation
for records to be maintained so that the position can be kept
under review.</b> </p>

<p>- The committee did not want to hinder the few doctors who are
experimenting with the use of cannabis in the treatment of
disturbed adolescents, amphetamine dependence, alcoholism and
other conditions which are difficult medical problems. Although
there have been few indications of success in this treatment, it
is hoped that the new legislation will not interfere with these
experiments. In summary, the Wootton report found that most of
the fears about cannabis were groundless. Physically it is much
less dangerous than the other illegal drugs; most people can give
it up readily and without withdrawal symptoms. Most cannabis
users are industrious and law-abiding; there is no evidence that
in Britain it provokes the user to crime other than the crime of
possessing it. nor is there any evidence to support the widely
held belief that cannabis is a significant step in the escalation
to heroin. It was agreed that cannabis is a potent drug, like
alcohol, and that is was necessary to maintain restrictions on
its availability for the time being; these restrictions would
have to be more severe than they are for alcohol until more was
known about the long-term effects of the drug. Nevertheless it
was quite inappropriate to make cannabis subject to the same
penalties as heroin under the Dangerous Drugs Act and it was
wrong to send people to prison for the possession of a small
amount. Research has been hampered and the law should be changed
so as to encourage careful long-term investigations into the
effects of smoking cannabis. When these results are available,
the interim recommendations should be reviewed. These main
conclusions were not so very different from the results found in
earlier reports including the very thorough investigations made
in India and the city of New York, and the more recent studies
made in Canada and by the President's Commission in Washington.
But the publication of the Wootton report was greeted with a
chorus of abuse from politicians, press and the public.<br>
