Requires</font></B></center>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=4> Until recently these were called "jumbo muffins", but now they are
simply "muffins." A single sandwich in some fast food joints can contain over
1,000 calories; accompanying fries, soft drink and the obligatory dessert can
nearly provide an adult's daily calorie requirement. <p>

Lisa Young was so aghast at
this elephantiasis of American cuisine that she is making it the subject of her
doctoral thesis at New York University. "People don't need forks, they need
shovels," she says, remarking on pasta bowls that "look like bathtubs" and
Bloody Mary glasses that hold a pint. "Europeans," she says, "are a lot more
quality conscious than they are here. Americans just want value for their
money," and base value on size. The result is that foods that are generally
considered healthy actually become terribly bad. "Pasta in Italy doesn't make
you fat, but in America it does," she says. 

<p>According to Jonathan Parry, design
director at Homer Laughlin China Company, the largest maker of restaurant
dinnerware in the United States, demand for big plates and big bowls has
ballooned since 1992. "Pasta bowls are really big, in popularity and in size.
Some hold 40 ounces." That's two and a half pounds. And are those bowls being
filled? Yes, and then some. The Cheesecake Factory, a chain known for its pasta
and dessert dishes, heaps food practically a foot high on its plates and
 proudly serves up a 12 oz burger. As for the cheesecake, each slice has about 700
calories. It claims it tried to serve lower-calorie slices but nobody wanted
them. 

<p>American steak sizes have long amazed foreign visitors. While dieticians
recommend one serving of meat a day of perhaps 3 1/2 oz, it is not unusual to
find American restaurants serving 16 oz slabs of artery-choking, gut-busting
meat. As one aghast Swede put it to an American health magazine, "A humongous
steak served to one person in an American restaurant would feed a family of four
in Sweden." A Macho Meal at the popular Del Taco Mexican fast-food chain weighs
almost four pounds, with a pound-and-a-quarter of that coming from a single
burrito. 

<p>A case study on the explosion in the American food portion is Nestle's
Butterfinger candy bar. Its original size, nearly 2 1/2 oz and 280 calories, was
already three times the size of a similar popular European chocolate bar, the
Ballisto. Yet a recent addition to the Butterfinger family called the
"supersize" came in at a hefty 4 oz and 510 calories. This bar is so big that
Time magazine chose it to illustrate the unhealthy trend of growing portion
sizes. Unabashed, Nestle has now created an even larger bar size, aptly named
"The Beast". It is an amazing 5 oz of mostly fat and sugar and contains almost a
third of a day's calories, 680. They are so big you could club somebody to death
with one. (In an ominous move, "supersized" candy bars from Nestle and Cadbury
have recently arrived in the UK.)

<p>In some parts of the United States McDonald's
sells a Double Big Mac that contains an amazing four beef patties. Sizzler
restaurants offer Australian Chicken, comprising half a chicken which is baked,
then deep-fat fried. Deny's serves a Super Slam breakfast with three eggs, three
pancakes, three sausage links and three strips of bacon. It is enough breakfast
for three persons, but is generally consumed by just one. 

<p>Just as the French
will adopt foreign dishes while making sure to give them French-accented names,
Americans readily adopt foreign desserts but turn them out in supersize
packages. An Italian ice in Italy comes close to the top of the small cup it
comes in. An Italian ice bought in Miami's trendy Coconut Grove is stacked so
high beyond the brim that only rapid consumption can prevent its contents from
falling over.

<p> Drink sizes are going up. Twenty-five years ago the size of a
soft-drink bottle dispensed by machines in both Europe and the United States was
generally about 8 fl oz. In Europe it is still that size, while in the United
States it increased to 12 fl oz and then, recently, to 20 fl oz (one pint). Many
quick-stop markets in the States, such as 7-11, now sell drinks in three-pint
cups. One is left wondering if the lids on the cups are to keep the contents
from splashing out or the drinker from accidentally falling in. They sell so
well that the company is considering making an even larger size, which its
spokeswoman describes as a "wading-pool- sized drink". 

<p>The increase in portion
sizes didn't happen overnight. It happened a food at a time, usually with
incremental increases. Little by little, portion sizes crept up, just as
Americans' weight has been creeping up. Most Americans have not the slightest
idea that their average muffins are twice the size and have twice the calories
of what you would buy in London or Paris. Of those who do, some just don't care.
By now it should have occurred to the reader to ask: can't Americans just eat
less of these monster portions? Of course they can. But that defeats the
purpose. If you wanted four McDonald's hamburger patties you could always buy
four hamburgers or two Big Macs. But the new super-sized portions allow you to
have all the food with none of the guilt because, after all, you have only eaten
one portion. Michael Fumento, an American, is a science correspondent for Reason
magazine. His book on the obesity epidemic will be published next year by Viking
Penguin.
