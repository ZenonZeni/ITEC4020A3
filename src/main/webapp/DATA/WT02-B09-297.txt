Re: Justice Department Action <P>


Dear Hunter:<P>
You'd better clear your schedule for the next couple of weeks. Attached is a copy of a document I received today. Apparently, the Justice Department is instituting legal action against you and Silicon Fusion for supplying restricted technology to a rebel group in one of the former Soviet republics. As best as I can make out, this rebel group is waging holy war against the spread of Western fast food into their country, and somehow, they're using Silicon Fusion technology to further their cause. I'm assuming that this is some kind of misunderstanding. Given your company's history of &quot;technological innovations,&quot; it's hard to imagine what this rebel group has that could possibly be a threat to anyone but themselves. <P>
Still, I advise you to treat this with the utmost seriousness. If convicted, you could face up to 30 years in prison. The fines could wipe out Silicon Fusion and take a big chunk out of your wife's trust fund as well. I pulled some strings at the Justice Department to forestall your arrest and the summary closure of Silicon Fusion. In the meantime, you better do some digging to find out what this is all about.<P>
By the way, where the hell is Hoezbagistan?<P>
