        for Obstetrical Units</font></h3>
        </center> <i><font color="#800000">Lynda Plummer, Senior
        Risk Management Consultant</font></i><p> With more and
        more patients getting involved in their care, the latest
        to come along in the obstetrical arena is a birth plan.
        These may also be known as a contract. The plan usually
        is a checklist or outline of choices that a woman in
        labor faces. If not from a checklist form, some patients
        actually present an outline of their expectations and
        &quot;requirements&quot; related to birth. </p>
        <p> Some plans outline choices such as a birthing suite,
        siblings in attendance at birth, type of anesthesia, etc.
        Others become expanded to include more clinical aspects
        such as administration of intravenous fluids, fetal
        monitoring, and types of delivery position. </p>
        <p> The plans are intended to be a means to facilitate
        discussions between expectant parents and care givers.
        They are not without some risk. These include the ability
        of the caregiver to comply with all requests (for
        example, a whirlpool may not be available), complying
        with the request may cause the facility to violate a
        written policy or a licensure requirement, and some
        patients may develop unrealistic expectations about the
        birth experience. </p>
        <p> Obstetrical caregivers need to be aware these plans
        exist. The facility may wish to communicate to
        physicians, midwives, and nursing staff of such plans by
        means of letters, memos, and/or educational programs. </p>
        <p> Do not wait until a patient walks into the unit in
        active labor and hands the nurse a &quot;contract&quot;
        to decide what to do! A multi-disciplinary team,
        including the risk manager, should be developed to
        recommend ways to deal effectively with patients who
        present birth plans. </p>
        <p> When addressing the use of birth plans, coordination
        among all members of the healthcare team is essential to
        ensure all items on the plan have been discussed with the
        expectant parents. It is also essential to document the
        discussions and communicate elements of the plan with all
        members of the team.</p>

        <td><b>Following are some of the issues that should be
        given consideration:</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>COMMUNICATION/EDUCATION:</b> Communication is a
        very important component of risk management.
        Communicating with the patient about their birth plans is
        particularly important. Identify who will be primarily
        responsible for the educational process related to birth
        plans. For example, physicians will want to discuss some
        issues such as monitoring, episiotomy, etc. Some other
        aspects of education may be delegated by the physician to
        the office nurse. It is also necessary to keep the
        hospital staff in the loop so they may address hospital
        procedures and concerns the expectant parents may have.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>RESOURCES/CAPABILITY:</b> The hospital must
        accurately portray their resources and capabilities. For
        example, if there is a limited number of birthing rooms,
        this needs to be indicated to the patient and that every
        effort will be made to accommodate their request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:</b> How will situations be
        handled when the patient request violates a known
        standard of care? Have risks related to refusal of
        certain treatment/procedures been explained and
        documented? How will emergency situations be handled?
        Have situations been addressed with the patient in
        advance? What alternatives will be considered and offered
        if the facility/provider cannot honor some requests?</td>
