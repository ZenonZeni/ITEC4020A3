     &quot;Pro-CODE&quot; Rides Again in 105th
     Burns to Push Bipartisan Bill Easing Limits on Encryption Exports


        WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Montana Senator Conrad Burns today announced
     that he will again introduce legislation in the next few days to ease
     government restrictions on encryption, or data security, software and
     hardware and to override the Clinton administration's encryption plan.

        &quot;Almost four years ago, the Clinton administration announced that
     its plan to help secure the massive amounts of information we move
     electronically was to give government a direct peephole into that
     information,&quot; Burns said.  &quot;Four years later, the president has not
     budged from this position.

        &quot;A significant bipartisan coalition in Congress and in the private
     sector has consistently rejected that approach.  We advanced the
     debate significantly in the last Congress but came up short because of
     White House obstructionism.  This time around, we intend to put a bill
     on the president's desk and find out if he is truly on the side of the
     users and providers of rapidly expanding high-tech goods and
     services.&quot;

        Burns announced the legislation along with cosponsors Sen. Patrick
     Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and with U.S. Rep. Bob
     Goodlatte (R-Va.), who is sponsoring a companion bill in the House, in
     a video teleconference with the RSA Data Security Conference in San
     Francisco.

        &quot;We're working hard to get the same broad cosponsorship we had in
     the last Congress, and we will be introducing a bill that is virtually
     identical to Pro-CODE from the last Congress,&quot; Burns said.

        Pro-CODE, or &quot;The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era
     Act,&quot; would ease export restrictions on encryption technology to a
     level deemed &quot;generally available&quot; worldwide by the U.S. Department of
     Commerce.  It would also prohibit a mandatory system under which
     producers or users of hardware and software would be required to
     surrender a decoding &quot;key&quot; to a third party.  An executive order
     signed by President Clinton would ease export restrictions to a level
     of 56 bits for applicants who agree to give up a copy of their
     decoding keys.

        &quot;This debate comes down to a potential loss of billions of
     high-tech dollars and thousands of high-tech jobs.  It comes down to
     significant harm to our global high-tech competitiveness.  It comes
     down to whether or not government can force people into making
     business and consumer choices, and whether government should have
     access to our most private communications.&quot;
