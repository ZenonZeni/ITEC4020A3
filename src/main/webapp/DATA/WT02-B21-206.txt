Official SURVEY.NET Policy</H2>
<H4>

There aren't a whole lot of rules around here.  You are encouraged to fully express your
opinions in filling out surveys, specifying comments and editorial, <I>however</I>, there
are a few things to note:

<UL>

<LI><B>COMPLETE EACH SURVEY ONE TIME ONLY!</B>  This is the one cardinal rule of SURVEY.NET.  You
should only complete each survey <I>once</I>.  While there are safeguards in place to protect
against multiple submissions, even if you have two completely separate accounts on different
systems, please only fill out a questionnaire one time.  
<P>
This is <I>extremely important</I>, and I will take action against anyone caught spamming
or attempting to taint the survey data.  Logs are maintained of all activity, and while the
actual survey data is anonymous, I can clearly identify malicious activity and multiple
submissions of surveys - when this happens I will BAN you (or possibly your ENTIRE system) 
from participating in any surveys, and will notify your Service Provider and give
them evidence of this activity - while I might not be able to tell exactly who the person
is doing the dirty-work, with the cooperation of an ISP, a person can be identified and
action can and will be taken.  
<P>
It is only with displeasure that I occasionally have to take this sort of action, and it's
not very often; the system's ability to "weed out" bad and redundant surveys is
pretty good at automating this process, but even when an attempt fails, the activity is logged
and I will ban users who have these "red flags."  
<P>
SURVEY.NET is only as good as the DATA we accumulate - and anyone attempting to taint the survey
data by spamming or submitting multiple forms is undermining everybody else's hard work, as well
as my own.  This will not be tolerated, and it's probably illegal under many jurisdictions.
<P>

<LI>SURVEY.NET IS A <I>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</I> ZONE with virtually no exceptions - This 
means that we <I>fully</I> respect one's ability to express themselves in 
whatever manner they desire (as long as it doesn't violate any of our other rules).  
Our system is automated 
for the most part, and user-specified comments are generally not screened unless they contain
some characters or HTML tokens which are not allowed, otherwise <I>there is no censorship of
any kind</I>.  We ask that people do not abuse this principal - it should be fairly easy to
express even the most passionate opinion without resorting to expletives and "4-letter words."
<P>
<I>With the entire world community able to participate in our surveys, it would
be hypocritical and unrealistic to impose any sort of "moral guidelines" regarding what people
can and cannot say.   As a result, there's no telling what kind of comments you might find, so
keep this in mind.  On the other hand, if you're not somewhat offended by something on this
site, that's a sign that we're not doing as good of a job - because we aim to attract a diverse
group of people to SURVEY.NET, and we don't expect them to all have homogenous opinions on
the issues.</I>
<P>

<LI>OUR SURVEY DATA AND COLLECTION PROCESS IS ROUTINELY MONITORED - As a result, from time-to-time,
I notice unusual increases in activity or radical changes to survey data.  When this happens,
depending upon the circumstance and the log files, I may take some sort of action in order to
find out what's going on.  First, I'll check the log files and see if I can identify any
malicious activity, if not, then I may take some sort of preemptive action in order to figure
out where this sudden burst of activity is coming from.  In the past I have temporarily
"locked-out" answers in surveys or temporarily banned users or systems until more information
becomes available to explain the surges in votes for particular answers in the surveys.
<P>
Sometimes, this activity is legitimate - other times it is not.  If all of a sudden, the
results of a survey dramatically change, I will need some evidence to indicate WHY before
I allow the trend to continue.  Generally, this tends to be the result of some organized
group aggressively directing people towards the site.  As long as they follow SURVEY.NET Policy
and each respondent is unique, if they provide evidence of their campaign to direct users
to the survey, I will allow the results to stand.  (This evidence can come in a variety of
forms: providing me with a URL from an active site which shows redirection of people to 
SURVEY.NET, copies of mailing list correspondence, etc.)  
<P>
Generally, when a survey's results dramatically change, I feel compelled to notify the community
(usually in the <I>Letters</I> page) of this occurance and what's going on.  I often incite
people on both sides of the fence: some who complain about my action or exposure, and others
who are upset that the survey data doesn't appear to be accurate or representative.  At the
present time, I reserve the right to take some sort of action in these circumstances; if you
don't like it - I'm sorry, but my priority is to protect the integrity of the data and the
collection process.  Sometimes this means exposing campaigns to exploit SURVEY.NET; other times
it involves defending unrealistic data that was properly submitted to SURVEY.NET.  As long as
each respondent is unique, I have no choice but to allow the survey results to stand.
<P>


<LI>SURVEY.NET *DOES* HAVE A "HIDDEN AGENDA" - Okay, you've badgered me into admitting that
there is possibly some underlying objective to SURVEY.NET.
<P>
If anything, SURVEY.NET has as a goal, to make more people aware of the diversity of humanity,
and that ultimately we should all respect each others' opinions regardless of whether they
coalesce with our own.  Every person on this earth has at least one pearl of wisdom that if
shared, may help somebody else.  If SURVEY.NET can act as a catalyst in helping people 
further understand humanity and society, we all might make the world a better place in one
way or another.  If we have a "hidden agenda", this is it.
