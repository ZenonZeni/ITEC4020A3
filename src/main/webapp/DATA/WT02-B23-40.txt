Announces Contract To Install Fund-Processing Software With 440
Financial</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>PITTSBURGH, April 15, 1995 - </B>Confluence Technologies, Inc.,
a Pittsburgh-based software company, has signed a contract to
install its mutual fund processing software product, FundStation,
at 440 Financial Group. FundStation automates many of the processes
that most mutual fund back offices currently perform manually.
440 becomes the second large provider of mutual fund services
to license FundStation, after SEI Corporation licensed the product
earlier this year.<BR>
<P>
&quot;440 has experienced tremendous growth, and FundStation will
allow us to continue to meet our commitments to clients in a timely
and cost-effective manner,&quot; said John J. Burke III, Director
of Funds Accounting, 440. &quot;Even more importantly, with FundStation
we can continue to tailor our service for each customer, which
is part of the basis for our success. Since we process more than
116 funds, this is no trivial task.&quot;<BR>
<P>
FundStation is a client/server application running under Microsoft
Windows. The system automates the collection of net asset values
and dividend rates into a central database, calculates yields
and total rates of return for each fund, and distributes all this
information to internal and external clients and systems. These
systems include the voice response unit, shareholder and participant
recordkeeping systems and several trust accounting systems.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The installation at 440 demonstrates FundStation's ability
to handle a large number of funds with a high degree of customization
for each fund family,&quot; said Michael J. Schiller, President
of Confluence Technologies, Inc. &quot;440 will realize significant
productivity gains in both the daily distribution of pricing data,
and from the monthly performance reporting supplied by FundStation.
Simple things like displaying total rates of return on the daily
reports can give 440 a real competitive edge.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Confluence Technologies, Inc. works exclusively with clients in
the trust, investment management, and mutual fund industries.
The company builds PC applications that work in a client/server
environment and complement existing mainframe applications. Confluence
Technologies is a member of the Microsoft Solutions Channels Program,
the National Investment Company Service Association, and the Pittsburgh
High Technology Council.<BR>
<P>
440 Financial Group of Worcester, Inc., a leading administrator
and distributor of bank mutual funds, provides integrated administration,
marketing, fund accounting, shareholder and telemarketing services
to existing and emerging mutual fund companies. It is a member
of Allmerica Financial, a diversified group of insurance and financial
services companies based in Worcester, Mass.<BR>
