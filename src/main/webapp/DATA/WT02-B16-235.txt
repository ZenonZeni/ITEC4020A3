<h2>Balance of System</h2>

<p><strong>Storage</strong>

<p>In many PV systems, energy will not be used as it is produced but may be required at night or on
cloudy days.  If tapping into the utility grid is not an option, a 
<a href="pvbattery.html">battery backup system</a> will be
necessary. The drawbacks to batteries are that they decrease the efficiency of the PV system,
because only about 80% of the energy channeled into them can be reclaimed. They also add to
the expense of the overall system and must be replaced every five to ten years.  They take up
considerable floor space, pose some safety concerns, and require periodic maintenance.

<br clear=all>
<p>Like PV cells, batteries are direct-current devices and are directly compatible only with dc loads.
However, batteries can also serve as a power conditioner for these loads by regulating power;
this allows the PV array to operate closer to its optimum power output. Most batteries must also
be protected from overcharge and excessive discharge, which can cause electrolyte loss and can
even damage or ruin the battery plates.  Protection is usually achieved using a charge controller,
which also maintains system voltage.  Most charge controllers also have a mechanism that
prevents current from flowing from the battery back into the array at night.
