<B>Lands Set Aside Pending Resolution<BR>
of Temagami-area Aboriginal Land Claims
</B></CENTER><P><BR>
<B>Background</B>
<UL>
<LI>In 1885, pursuant to the Robinson Huron Treaty of 1850, the federal government surveyed land known as the Austin Bay Tract, on the south-east side of Lake Temagami, as a potential reserve for Aboriginal people living in the area.  The area surveyed comprised 65 square miles.  However, the provincial government of the day did not agree to the creation of the proposed reserve, and the Austin Bay Tract remains provincially owned Crown land today.<P>

<LI>In 1971, an official Reserve was established for the Temagami First Nation on Bear Island in Lake Temagami.  The area of the reserve is one square mile.  However, the Aboriginal people living in the area continue to claim a much larger area.<P>

<LI>In 1973, in order to advance a claim to ownership of their traditional territory, comprising 4,000 square miles, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai -- or TAA, which represents the Temagami First Nation and other Aboriginal people in the area -- filed formal land cautions with the Registrar of Titles on the 4,000 square-mile area, involving 110 geographic townships in and around the Temagami area.<P>

<LI>The land caution did not affect commercial forestry operations, but prevented the staking of new mining claims and new tourism-related economic development.<P>

<LI>In 1993, the Government of Ontario and the Teme-Augama-Anishnabai negotiated an Agreement-in-Principle designed to settle the outstanding land claim.  However, the Agreement-in-Principle was not ratified by the local Aboriginal people.<P>

<LI>During the negotiations for the Agreement-in-Principle, two categories of land were proposed:<P>
<UL>
<LI>land that would be under the sole jurisdiction and management of the Aboriginal people; and
<LI>land that would be managed under joint stewardship of the Aboriginal people and the provincial government.
</UL><P>
<LI>Working through the courts, the provincial government succeeded in 1995 in having the land caution removed on the 110 townships in and around the Temagami area.  The government will open most of the Crown land in the former caution area to staking under the Mining Act.<P>



<LI>Within the former caution area, there are a number of long-standing mining claims and mining leases, but the land caution prevented the owners of the claims and/or leases from actively working on the site.
</UL><P><BR>




<B>Ontario's Approach</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>The Government of Ontario is setting aside a significant area of land in the Temagami area to provide new economic development opportunities for local Aboriginal people, and to facilitate the settlement of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai land claim.<P>

<LI>The area being set aside contains the land in the Austin Bay Tract, and other lands that would have been under the sole jurisdiction of Aboriginal people under the non-ratified Agreement-in-Principle of 1993.  The government anticipates that some or all of the set-aside land could figure in the settlement of the outstanding land claim.<P>

<LI>The set-aside lands, while remaining Crown land, will not be opened to staking under the Mining Act, and the provincial government will make no new development or resource commitments on this land without the consent of the Temagami First Nation or the TAA.  Any of the land that does not figure in the settlement of the TAA's land claim will revert to the Crown's administrative jurisdiction, and will be managed according to the land-use recommendations for the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area as put forward by the Comprehensive Planning Council, and as they may be amended by Ontario.
</UL><P><BR>


<B>Implementation</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Existing mining claims and leases on Crown land in the former caution area -- except for those lands within the area to be set aside for settlement of the Aboriginal land claim -- will be honored, and the province will uphold the legal right of the claim owners and leaseholders to explore and develop their mining rights.<P>

<LI>The set-aside area will not be included in the land base used to calculate the Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD) for the Temagami Management Unit forest management plan.<P>

<LI>Economic development opportunities on the set-aside land -- such as forestry, mining or land disposition -- will be subject to recommendations from the Chief and Council of the Temagami First Nation, and the Chief and Executive Council of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai.  The Crown's representatives for receiving such recommendations will be the ministries of Natural Resources and Northern Development and Mines.<P>


<LI>Any development that ultimately occurs on the set-aside lands will be governed by applicable provincial laws, policies and regulations.  For example, any new forestry activities would require an amendment to the existing Temagami Management Unit Forest Management Plan.<P>

<LI>In determining appropriate recommendations for the set-aside lands, the Ontario government will encourage Aboriginal representatives to consider maximizing the economic benefits to the members of their communities.
<LI>The government has proposed setting aside these lands in the Temagami area for a two-year period, to facilitate the resolution of the Aboriginal land claim.  If a land claim settlement has not been reached by the end of this period, the government will review the status of the lands.
