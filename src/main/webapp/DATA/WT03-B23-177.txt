<FONT SIZE=+2><I><B>Money Market Funds</B></I></FONT>

<P>
Money market funds were originally created as an alternative to savings accounts and became perfect places for investors to keep their money to maintain a ready cash supply.  These funds are invested primarily in short-term debt instruments and are competitive with bank savings accounts and CDs. Since many of the funds were sold by securities broker/dealers, investors had the additional confidence that their money market account was insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).

<P>
Unlike other mutual funds, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of each share of a money market fund is supposed to be held constant at $1.00.  This constant price means that for every dollar invested in the fund, you should get back a dollar, plus whatever interest your money earned from the fund's investments. As an added appeal, most money market funds allow investors to write checks against their account balances.

<P>
Although the majority of money market funds are managed conservatively, there are some risks to consider. First, during periods of declining interest rates, investors should not seek the highest yielding fund since the funds may have stretched to improve their yields by taking on more risk. Since the rate a fund pays should be roughly the same as short-term Treasury bills, commercial paper and CDs, anything substantially higher should be a warning sign to investors. Second, there is reinvestment risk during periods of declining interest rates. Because the average maturity of the investments held in a money market fund is relatively short, your money market rate will soon decline, thus forcing you to keep reinvesting you money at lower and lower rates. For these reasons, money market funds are generally used to invest money for the short-term rather than long-term.

<P>

An investment in a money market is not insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government and that there can be no assurance the funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00. Each of these alternatives declares income daily and pays income monthly. Client accounts are protected by the Securities Protection Act and the regulations under it, for up to $10 million per customer. Up to $500,000 is covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and up to an additional $9.5 million is covered under an insurance policy issued by an affiliate of Wexford Clearing Services Corporation. Coverage of cash is limited to $100,000.
