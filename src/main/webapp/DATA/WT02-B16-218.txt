<p><strong>Systems Engineering</strong>
<P>
Because building a strong industry and stimulating a healthy market is the ultimate aim of the
PV program, we work with industry to test and validate the performance of emerging
technologies and develop codes and standards. 
<P>
Testing and Validation
<P>
The program makes its facilities available to industry to evaluate the material, mechanical,
electrical, and safety characteristics of PV cells, modules, BOS components, and complete
systems. By providing U.S. PV manufacturers with laboratory assistance in the form of tests,
measurements, and characterizations, program scientists and engineers can help these typically
small companies accelerate product improvements. By testing and evaluating prototype and
precommercial modules, the program helps industry understand and improve the performance,
reliability, and operational characteristics of its products. Toward this end, scientists at the
Outdoor Test Facility at <a href="nrel.html">NREL</a> correlate the measured solar resource, air
temperature, humidity, and wind with the electrical performance of modules. The laboratories
and their contractors have also organized an extensive network to evaluate the field performance
of systems, which is critical for understanding and improving hardware performance and
reliability.

<P>
 Codes and Standards
<P>
To be accepted in potential markets, PV systems must conform to national and international
standards of safety and reliability&#151;such standards as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and the
National Electrical Code (NEC). Many of these codes, however, do not currently address PV
systems directly. So, we are working closely with industry in standards groups to ensure that
there are appropriate requirements for commercial PV systems. Program personnel also work
with manufacturers to help get their products approved by such organizations. Many potential
consumers are also interested in standard reporting of expected energy production, similar to the
annual-energy-use stickers now on major appliances. The program also contributes its facilities
and expertise to develop such standard reporting methods.
