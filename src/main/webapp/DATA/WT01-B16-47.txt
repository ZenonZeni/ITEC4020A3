<h2>1. Program Overview: Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program issued a program plan in December 1994
that described a new, more flexible approach to achieving the Program's objectives. During
1995, important progress was made. The Program has been required to revise that approach in
response to guidance from the President and the Congress and to the funding reduction in the
Fiscal Year 1996 program appropriation. This revised Program Plan has been prepared to
describe the changes we have made in our activities to the Congress, regulatory and oversight
bodies, other stakeholders, and the public.
<p>
<em>Section 1, Program Overview, </em>briefly reviews the Program's history and policy background,
discusses Congressional and Administrative actions during the past year, and summarizes the
revised program strategy, milestones, and funding requirements. <a href="ch21.htm"><em>Section 2, Program and Project
Activities</em></a>, describes the near-term activities planned under the revised strategy, and outlines
longer-term activities that assume the Yucca Mountain site is found suitable and that, in 1999, an
interim storage facility site is designated.<a href="apptoc.htm"> <em>Section 3, Appendices</em></a>, presents additional information
on program changes and background information on the Program.
<p>
In addition to incorporating changes that reflect current policy and funding realities, the <em>Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan, Revision 1</em>, charts a path forward that will allow
the Program to achieve its ultimate goal: the safe disposal of the Nation's spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
<h4>1.1 Solving a National Problem</h4>
<p>
The safe, long-term isolation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste has become
one of the most challenging environmental problems confronting the Nation. Spent nuclear fuel
from commercial reactors has been accumulating throughout the United States since the first
commercial nuclear power plant started operating in December 1957. Since the Manhattan
Project began in 1942, the Federal Government has operated reactors and processed spent fuel
for defense nuclear activities, generating large quantities of high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
Much is at stake in the effort to resolve the problem of accumulating spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste. Confidence in the ultimate removal of spent fuel from commercial
reactor sites is critical to maintaining public support for the nuclear-generating capacity that
currently supplies more than 20 percent of the Nation's electric energy. Permanent geologic
disposal is also the long-term destination of the high-level waste resulting from cleanup of the
Cold War weapons complex.
<p>
The challenge of safely managing and disposing of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste has engaged the efforts of many individuals and organizations for decades. The Federal
Government's effort to find a long-term solution to this problem is receiving increased attention
from the Administration and the Congress as a result of escalating cost estimates, schedule
delays, and the unmet expectations of the initial policies. 
<p>
<h4>1.1.1     National Policy Adopted</h4>

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Federal Government's responsibility to
provide for the permanent disposal of the Nation's high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear
fuel, and directed that the generators and owners of these wastes be responsible for the costs of
their management and disposal. The Act authorized the Department of Energy to develop a
system to safely manage and permanently dispose of the spent nuclear fuel accumulating at
commercial reactors.
<p>
The primary goal of the Act was the siting, construction, and operation of a mined geologic
repository. As originally enacted, the Act also directed the Department to study the need for and
feasibility of a monitored retrievable storage facility. The Act provided for the disposal of
defense-related high-level radioactive waste as well as spent nuclear fuel, if the President
determined that could be done. In 1985, the President found no basis to conclude that a
defense-only repository was required and, therefore, under provisions of the Act, the Department
was to proceed with plans and actions to dispose of defense waste together with commercial
spent nuclear fuel in a single repository. <em>See box on this page for a discussion of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste inventories.</em>
<p>
The Act directed that the civilian portion of the system be funded by the generators and owners
of nuclear-generated electricity through a fee on the commercial generation of nuclear power to
be deposited into the Nuclear Waste Fund. The portion of the system's cost for the disposal of
waste generated or owned by the Federal Government was to be paid for by the Government.
The Act directed the Department of Energy to undertake a national screening process for
candidate repository sites. In 1986, the Department recommended three sites to the President for
further study as possible geologic repositories. In the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of
1987, the Congress redirected the Department to investigate only one potential repository site, at
Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and to report on the need for a second repository between 2007 and
2010. The Amendments Act also imposed conditions that restricted the Department's ability to
site and develop a storage facility.
<p>
<a href="./appa.htm"><em>Appendix A</em></a> provides a summary discussion of the "Evolution of the National Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program."
<hr>
<h5><strong>Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste Destined for Ultimate
Geologic Disposal<a href="./foot1.htm"> [1]</a></strong>
<p>
The United States has a growing inventory of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear
reactors, currently stored in 33 States at 72 operating and shutdown commercial reactor sites and
one storage site. Existing pool storage facilities at commercial utility reactor sites are reaching
their full capacities. By the end of 1996, a projected 12 of the 72 commercial reactor sites in 11
States will require additional on-site storage (either pool or dry storage). The total cumulative
discharge of spent nuclear fuel from the 119 currently operating and shutdown commercial
nuclear reactors will total about 84,000 metric tons uranium (MTU) by the year 2035, when the
last commercial reactor completes its initial 40-year license period.
<p>
The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program estimates that approximately 13,800
canisters of primarily defense-related high-level radioactive waste will require disposal<a href="./foot1.htm">.[2] </a>
Program plans call for using approximately 10 percent of the repository's capacity for disposal of
radioactive waste from defense nuclear activities and spent nuclear fuel owned by the Federal
Government. The Government-owned spent nuclear fuel inventory is expected to be about 2,700
metric tons of heavy metal<a href="./foot1.htm">[3] </a>(MTHM) by the year 2035, most of which is spent fuel from
weapons material production reactors. It also includes 65 MTHM of spent nuclear fuel from
nuclear-powered naval vessels and 22 MTHM of spent nuclear fuel of U.S. origin from foreign
research reactors. </h5>
<hr>
<h4>1.1.2     Challenges in Implementing the Evolving National Policy</h4>
<p>
In the years since passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Program has faced changing legislative mandates, regulatory modifications,
fluctuating funding levels, and the evolving and often conflicting needs and expectations of
diverse interest groups. During the 1980s, the real complexity of the scientific and regulatory
challenge at the Yucca Mountain site began to be realized, and projected costs greatly exceeded
initial expectations. It became increasingly clear that many of the expectations embodied in the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act could not be met.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 nullified the Department of Energy's
proposal to site a monitored retrievable storage facility at one of three locations within the State
of Tennessee and placed additional restrictions on interim storage siting. The Office of the
Nuclear Waste Negotiator, established by the 1987 amendments, was unable to secure a
volunteer host for a storage facility before the termination of the Office's authority in January
1995. While a number of local and Tribal governments considered the possibility of hosting a
storage facility in their jurisdictions, considerable opposition was generated within their
respective States and no final proposals for a Federal facility were developed.
<p>
The end result was increased Congressional and constituent dissatisfaction with the Program. By
1993, it became clear that continuation of the Program as then planned was no longer viable. The
issue was not whether a new approach was needed, but whether one could be found that would
accomplish the objectives of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act within practical resource limitations
and reasonable schedules. 
<p>
<h4>1.1.3     The 1994 Program Plan and Early Accomplishments</h4>
<p>
In 1993, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the Program's activities to resolve the
disparity between the activities that were actually being carried out and stakeholder expectations
for costs, schedules, and accomplishments. We obtained the opinions of our oversight and
regulatory bodies, the Administration, the Congress, and key program stakeholders. From these
deliberations, we developed a new, more flexible approach to make measurable and significant
progress toward key objectives.
<p>
The new program approach, described in the December 1994 <em>Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Program Plan</em>, addressed concerns with cost increases and schedule slippages. The
Congress endorsed the new approach by approving a 37 percent increase in funding for Fiscal
Year 1995. It was also generally endorsed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board.
<p>
We defined two major projects or "business centers" within the Program -- the Yucca Mountain
Site Characterization Project and the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project -- 
and created a Management Center to provide program integration and management support to the
Program Director and the projects.<a href="./fig1.gif"> <em>Figure 1</em></a> illustrates the program organization as restructured
under the 1994 program approach.
<p><pre>
<strong>                                        Figure 1
		     Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program
			     Business Management Centers</strong><br>
		<img src="fig1.gif">
</pre><p>
The 1994 program approach refocused the work of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project business center on (1) evaluating by 1998 the technical suitability of the Yucca Mountain
site for development as a geologic repository; (2) delivering a statutory site recommendation and
Environmental Impact Statement to the President by 2000, contingent on a positive suitability
evaluation; and (3) submitting a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by
2001. We expected to receive authorization from the Commission to construct the repository in
2004, and 2010 remained the target for emplacing waste into a geologic repository.
<p>
The main objectives of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project business
center were to (1) make a new generation of spent fuel storage and transportation technology,
multi-purpose canisters, available by 1998; (2) support timely resolution of waste acceptance and
interim storage issues; and (3) maintain readiness to develop a centralized interim storage facility
and a timely national capability to transport spent nuclear fuel. 
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1995, we made significant progress toward achieving the new program approach
objectives through the efficiencies gained from improved technical, cost, and schedule planning
and implementation; through a restructured organization focused on attaining measurable results
with clear lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability; and from the increased resources
provided by the Fiscal Year 1995 Congressional appropriation of $522 million. 
<p>
<strong>Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Accomplishments</strong><br>

The Yucca Mountain site investigation has been advanced greatly since the 1994 Program Plan
was developed. Excavation of the exploratory tunnel into Yucca Mountain is proceeding faster
than planned. No unexpected adverse features have been found. The rock quality at the potential
repository level is as good as or better than predicted, increasing the probability that a repository
with a nuclear waste capacity at the 70,000 metric tons uranium (MTU) statutory limit can be
constructed. The potential repository area is as dry as expected, with some indications that
ground water flow at the repository horizon has been very limited for 100,000 years or longer.
The scientific strategy for evaluating the ability of the repository to isolate waste has matured
significantly, due to the integration of available scientific knowledge and the new data being
obtained from the exploratory tunnel. The Program has completed a comprehensive analysis of
expected repository performance<em> (Total System Performance Assessment - 1995)</em> that materially
increases our understanding of the key issues important to safety, and advances the development
of a waste containment and isolation strategy for the repository concept.
<p>
These significant advances in the scientific evaluation of Yucca Mountain have allowed the
Program to focus on completing the information needed for an assessment in 1998 of the
viability of geologic disposal at the site as described in this revised Program Plan.
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Accomplishments</strong><br>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Program made meaningful progress in developing multi-purpose
canisters. A contract was awarded for the design and preparation of safety analyses for a
multi-purpose canister system, and a Preliminary Draft Environmental Impact Statement was
developed. One half-scale model of a high-capacity truck cask was fabricated and testing was
initiated. The Program also sought public comments on plans for providing technical and
financial assistance for training public safety officials along waste transportation routes.
<p>
<strong>Program Management Accomplishments
</strong><br>
Substantial improvements have been made in the integration and efficiency of program
management:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Program participants at the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project have either
been fully consolidated under the Management and Operating Contractor, or now work under a
Memorandum of Understanding with that organization.
<li>Management systems, such as cost and schedule baselines and reporting processes, were
restructured and streamlined to ensure more efficient utilization of resources and more effective
control of work scope.
</ul><p>
The improved management capability and planning basis have assisted in the Program's ability
to preserve the core scientific programs at Yucca Mountain at a reduced level of funding, and to
develop and propose a revised course of action that has the potential to regain the target of
repository licensing within a reasonable time frame.
<p>
Most of the program objectives targeted for Fiscal Year 1995 were accomplished and progress is
continuing, as indicated in<em> Table 1</em></a>. A few planned activities and milestones were revised or
deferred in response to expected Fiscal Year 1996 funding reductions. <a href="appb.htm"><em>Appendix B</em></a> provides an
expanded list of the Program's progress during Fiscal Year 1995.

<p>
<h4>1.2  Program Redirection and Transition</h4>
<p>
 <h4>1.2.1    Revisiting the National Policy on Radioactive Waste Management</h4>
<p>
While the Program was implementing its new approach, the national policy debate on the issues
of the near-term management of radioactive waste intensified. Nearly a dozen legislative
proposals were introduced in both chambers of the Congress during 1995. Some of these would,
if enacted, significantly alter the basic policies established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982 and its 1987 amendments.
<p>
The most comprehensive of the pending bills address demands by the nuclear power industry and
State utility regulators in States with commercial nuclear power plants that the Congress declare
that the Department of Energy has an unconditional obligation to begin acceptance of
commercial spent nuclear fuel by 1998. These bills would authorize and direct the Department to
begin development work immediately on an interim storage facility at a Congressionally
designated site.
<p>
<h4>1.2.2     Congressional Appropriations Action For Fiscal Year 1996</h4>
<p>
The Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations process took place in the midst of both this legislative
activity and the larger debate over deficit reduction and balancing the national budget. Deficit
reduction pressures and an emphasis on interim storage issues resulted in appropriations
decisions that have had a significant impact on the Program.
<p>
The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1996 provided a total of $400 million
for the Program, $85 million of which was designated to be used only for the development of an
interim storage facility and only upon enactment of new statutory authority. Pending such
authority, the Program was effectively reduced to a $315 million funding level, or one-half of the
$630 million funding level anticipated for the continuation of the 1994 program approach.
<p>
The Congress recognized that the significant reduction in funding would require a more
constrained repository program. The Conference Report accompanying the appropriations
language provided the following guidance:
<p>
<em>"The conferees agree on the importance of continuing existing scientific work at Yucca
Mountain to determine the ultimate feasibility and licensability of the permanent repository at
that site. The conferees direct the Department to refocus the repository program on completing
the core scientific activities at Yucca Mountain. The Department should complete excavation of
the necessary portions of the exploratory tunnel and the scientific tests needed to assess the
performance of the repository. It should defer preparation and filing of a license application for
the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until a later date. The Department's goal
should be to collect the scientific information needed to determine the suitability of the Yucca
Mountain site and to complete a conceptual design for the repository and waste package for later
submission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."<a href="./foot1.htm">[4]</a>
</em><p>
<h4>1.2.3     Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriations Impact on the Program</h4>
<p>
Under the funding reductions for Fiscal Year 1996, the 1994 program approach was no longer
sustainable. We were required to take immediate action to reduce spending in a manner that
ensures the Program's ability to meet its legal obligations and avoid a funding deficiency in
Fiscal Year 1996. Our only recourse was to try to preserve the most critical activities while we
made the required reductions and bore the resulting termination costs.
<p>
Based on the expectation of a reduced budget from the Fiscal Year 1995 level of $522 million to
$400 million, and observing the guidance contained in the early Congressional reports, action
was taken in September 1995 to reduce contractor work scope and eliminate about 875 contractor
jobs during Fiscal Year 1996 primarily within the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
in Nevada<a href="./foot1.htm">.[5]</a> In November 1995, more than 200 additional contractor jobs were eliminated to
reflect the Congressional reservation of $85 million for the development of an interim storage
facility. Consistent with the nature of that restriction and the already severe impact of the initial
reduction on the repository program, this second reduction primarily affected the work of the
Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project and Management Center.
<p>
The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project's funding was reduced from $375 million in
Fiscal Year 1995 to $250 million in Fiscal Year 1996. Consistent with the Congressional
guidance provided in the Conference Report accompanying the appropriations language, the
Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project was refocused to emphasize core scientific
activity, excavation of sections of the Exploratory Studies Facility necessary for scientific study,
and completion of the repository and waste package conceptual designs. Activities supporting
preparation and filing of a license application for the repository were deferred.
<p>
The Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project's funding was reduced from $57
million in Fiscal Year 1995 to approximately $14 million in Fiscal Year 1996. As a result of this
reduction, the Program has had to terminate funding for Phase II of the multi-purpose canister
program, during which Nuclear Regulatory Commission certification of the design developed
during Phase I would have been received. The contract for the multi-purpose canister
development program is being brought to an orderly close. The Department of Energy ceased to
be the lead agency on the Environmental Impact Statement for the multi-purpose canister, and
responsibilities have been assumed by the Department of the Navy for naval spent nuclear fuel
container selection.
<p>
We will also terminate the contract for certifying two General Atomics high-capacity
transportation casks (the GA-4 and GA-9 casks), which would have provided an option for
transporting uncanistered spent fuel from reactors to a storage or disposal facility by truck. 
<p>
Cooperative agreements between the Program and external organizations involved in nuclear
waste policy or activities have been reduced in Fiscal Year 1996 to approximately one-third of
their Fiscal Year 1995 funding level.
<p>
Program Management Center funding was reduced by 43 percent from $90 million in Fiscal Year
1995 to $51 million in Fiscal Year 1996. Major cuts have been made in the work scope and
contractor support for program management functions, which include the activities of the Office
of Human Resources and Administration, the Office of Quality Assurance, and the Office of
Program Management and Integration.
<p>
<h4>1.2.4     President's Program Guidance for Fiscal Year 1997</h4>
<p>
The President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request provided additional guidance to the Program by
underscoring the Administration's continued commitment to geologic disposal. The budget
request endorses Congress' recommendation to concentrate initially on addressing the major
unresolved technical questions at the Yucca Mountain site. It provides $400 million for the
Program, $339 million of which would go to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project.
Of the remaining funds, the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project would
receive $10 million and the Management Center $51 million.
<p>
The President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request defines a new program objective:  to address by
1998 the remaining significant technical questions regarding the Program's hypotheses about the
Yucca Mountain site and the scientific, engineering, and financial feasibility of building a
geologic repository there. Consistent with Fiscal Year 1996 Congressional guidance, the Program
will make an assessment in 1998 of the viability of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain. The
assessment will consist of a package of tasks that will provide an understanding of the repository
design and its performance in the geologic setting; an estimate of the remaining work needed to
prepare a license application; and a more precise estimate of the cost of a repository. The
viability assessment will also contribute to the preparation of the subsequent, statutorily required
Secretarial site recommendation to the President, if the site is found to be suitable, and to the
license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The President's budget request also
provides for funds to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project and to perform contingency planning to maintain an ability to respond
rapidly should the Administration and the Congress agree on new policy direction for interim
storage.
<p>
<a href="./fig2.gif"><em>Figure 2</em> </a>presents the Program's budget distribution for the Fiscal Year 1995 appropriation, the

<h4>1.3 Revised Program Strategy</h4>
<p>
The Program has defined a revised program strategy consistent with the guidance provided by the
President and the Congress, the exigencies of the Fiscal Year 1996 situation, and the outlook for
future funding. Available resources have been concentrated on those efforts that are most
essential to the long-range success of the Program's mission to manage and dispose of the
Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. With adequate future funding, the
revised strategy will enable the Program to maintain progress toward accomplishing the goals of
the Nation's civilian radioactive waste management policy on a reasonable schedule.
<p>
The revised program strategy is designed to maintain the momentum that has been achieved in
the scientific investigation of the Yucca Mountain site and to regain target dates for determining
the site's suitability for a geologic repository and for submitting a license application. The efforts
of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project have been redirected to address the major
unresolved technical questions so that, in 1998, an assessment can be made of the viability of
licensing and constructing a repository at the Yucca Mountain site. The Program will also
consider revisions to the regulatory framework which may be needed to implement the
restructured repository project plan. The Program expects to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission in 2002 for a license authorizing construction of a repository at the Yucca Mountain
site.
<p>
The Program will maintain a core capability in the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project to lay the groundwork for new policy direction regarding interim storage.
We have devised a strategy based upon the assumption that an interim storage facility site will be
designated in 1999. This assumption reflects the Administration's position that the interim
storage facility siting decision should be informed by the results of the Yucca Mountain viability
assessment to be completed in 1998.<a href="./foot1.htm">[6]</a>
<p>
Some waste acceptance, storage, and transportation activities can be conducted prior to
designation of an interim storage facility site, and could expedite the start of interim storage
operations when a site is designated and the facility authorized. These activities are the
development of a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector for waste acceptance,
storage, and transportation services, and the conduct of design, engineering and safety analyses
for a non-site specific, phased, interim storage facility. Work to be accomplished after a site is
designated includes facility development and the acquisition of waste acceptance, storage, and
transportation equipment and services from the private sector.<a href="./appc.htm"><em> Appendix C</em></a> discusses activities to
be conducted after a site is designated.
<p>
Finally, the efficiency of program management has been significantly improved to reduce
management costs. The program management function will be further refined to support the
revised strategy and to enhance our management capabilities in the particular area of
management information and control systems. 
<p>
The key elements of the revised program strategy are summarized below. An expanded
discussion is provided in <em><a href="./ch21.htm">Sections 2.1</a>,<a href="./ch22.htm"> 2.2,</a> and <a href="./ch23.htm">2.3.</a></em>
<p>
<h4>1.3.1     Update the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997</h4>
<p>
Based on our site characterization progress and the policy changes that have occurred over the
past 10 years, we will propose amendments to the Department's siting guidelines (10 CFR Part
960) that will lead to a more efficient process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca
Mountain site for development as a geologic repository. Efficiencies will result from adopting a
streamlined methodology specific to the Yucca Mountain site for applying the siting guidelines.
Siting guideline revisions will be developed concurrently with the development of a site-specific
radiological protection standard for Yucca Mountain by the Environmental Protection Agency
and conformance of the licensing regulations to this new standard by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. We will continue to consult with the Agency, the Commission, and other
stakeholders as the regulatory framework for the geologic repository is updated.
<p>
<h4>1.3.2     Complete Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain Repository Site in 1998</h4>
<p>
A principal objective of the revised strategy is to address by 1998 the major unresolved technical
questions so that an informed assessment can be made of the viability of licensing and
constructing a geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site. This objective will require the
completion of tasks that constitute a logical convergence point in the Program's work. The tasks
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>a package of more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository concept
and the waste package;
<li> a total system performance assessment, based upon that design concept and the scientific
data and analysis that will be available to us by 1998, which will describe the probable behavior
of the repository in the Yucca Mountain geologic setting;
<li>   a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license
application; and
<li>    an upgraded estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository in accordance
with the design.
</ul><p>
The Congress directed, and the reduced funding level in Fiscal Year 1996 has required, that
repository licensing activities be deferred. The goal of submitting a successful license application
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, remains central to the Program's mission. The
work completed for the viability assessment will be an early and integral step on the path to a
license application. The Administration's budget request for Fiscal Year 1997 sets forth a scope
of work, budget profile, and schedule for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project that
are capable of supporting an application to the Commission for the repository license in 2002.
The revised Program Plan is consistent with that funding outlook, with the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act, as amended, and with the current understanding of the waste containment and isolation
strategy appropriate to the Yucca Mountain site. The Program's regulatory approach and plans
set forth earlier in the evolution of the Yucca Mountain Project will be revised to reflect the new
approach.
<p>
<h4>1.3.3     Recommend a Repository Site to the President in 2001 and Submit a Repository License
Application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002</h4>
<p>
The Program's strategy for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project has been revised to
identify, prioritize, and schedule a focused set of site characterization activities that will allow us
to submit a license application for construction authorization in 2002. Our activities will
concentrate on the factors that are significant to the performance of a repository at the Yucca
Mountain site. After completion of the viability assessment in 1998, we will prepare the
additional information required for the Secretary of Energy's site recommendation to the
President and for the license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As part of the
site recommendation and license application process, we will issue the Draft Repository
Environmental Impact Statement for public review and comment in 1999 and issue the Final
Repository Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision in 2000. If the site is found
suitable in accordance with our revised siting guidelines, the Secretary will issue a site
recommendation in 2001, following public hearings that the Program will conduct in the State of
Nevada prior to the possible site recommendation. The decision on site recommendation will be
based on the data obtained from site characterization, a description of the proposed repository
and waste package, the Final Repository Environmental Impact Statement, preliminary
comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the sufficiency of our information for
licensing, the views and comments of the State of Nevada, and other relevant information
required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended. If the site is approved, we will submit a
license application in 2002. This schedule will allow us to meet our long-term goal of starting
repository emplacement operations in 2010.
<p>
<h4>1.3.4     Develop Market-Driven Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Approach</h4>
<p>
The revised program strategy includes a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector
for transportation, storage, and waste acceptance services. The approach will allow for the
maximum use of private industry capabilities, expertise, and experience in accepting,
transporting, and storing commercial spent nuclear fuel. The Program plans to develop and
implement a competitive procurement process resulting in awards of fixed-price, multi-year,
performance-based contracts to obtain needed services and equipment at a reasonable cost.
Incentives and flexibility will be offered to encourage innovative private sector approaches.
Under this approach, private industry will act for the Department in carrying out certain functions
under the <em>Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive
Waste (10 CFR Part 961)</em> to accept spent nuclear fuel at utility sites for delivery to a Federal
facility.
<p>
<h4>1.3.5     Conduct Non-Site Specific Design and Engineering Safety Analyses</h4>
<p>
Our interim storage readiness capability will be based upon a phased interim storage facility
consistent with the concept discussed during Congressional debate. We will address the
technical, safety, and procedural issues involved in licensing an interim storage facility to
expedite the process if an interim storage site is designated. We have initiated development of a
non-site specific topical safety analysis report for the first phase of operations at an interim
storage facility. This report is scheduled to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for review in 1997. Completion of a topical safety analysis report and its subsequent submittal to
the Commission for review and approval are contingent upon adequate future funding. 
<p>
<h4>1.3.6     Restructure Program Management Activities</h4>
<p>
The revised strategy also restructures program management activities consistent with a reduced
funding level and the Program's refocused priorities. The Management Center will provide
continued administrative support and strategic planning assistance to the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Project and Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project as the
revised Program Plan is implemented. It will address the crosscutting issues affecting both
business centers, and support the Director's office in overall management and representation of
the Program and in development of program policies and strategic plans. Efforts will concentrate
on improving and updating management systems to ensure the efficient application of reduced
funding levels to program priorities. Emphasis will also be placed on increasing the ability of the
Federal management staff to carry out its responsibilities with reduced contractor support.
