"In 1824, domestic hemp was pitted against Russian hemp by rigging the USS Constitution on one side with 
American and the other with Russian grown hemp, 'and after being thus worn for nearly a year, it was found, 
on examination, that the Russian rope, in every instance, after being much worn, looked better and wore more 
equally and evenly than the American.' But the commander said, 'the difference between them was not so 
great as to warrant a declaration that the proof was conclusive in favor of the Russian....'"<br>

"The Federal Government in 1841 authorized a bounty, which allowed for the payment of not more than $280 
per ton for American water-retted hemp, provided it was suitable for naval cordage. Many of the planters 
prepared large pools and water-retted the hemp they produced. But the work was so hard on Negroes that the 
practice was abandoned. Many Negroes died of pneumonia contracted from working in the hemp-pools in the 
winter, and the mortality became so great among hemp hands that the increase in value of the hemp did not 
equal the loss in Negroes." <br>

"There is no reason why hemp culture should not extend over a dozen States and the product used in 
manufactures which now employ thousands of tons of imported fibers." <br>

"Several [varieties of hemp] are grown in this country, that cultivated in Kentucky and having a hollow stem, 
being the most common. China hemp, with slender stems, growing very erect, has a wide range of culture. 
Smyrna hemp is adapted to cultivation over a still wider range and Japanese hemp is beginning to be 
cultivated, particularly in California, where it reaches a height of 15 feet.  Russian and Italian seed have been 
experimented with, but the former produces a short stalk, while the latter only grows to a medium height. A 
small quantity of Piedmontese hemp seed from Italy was distributed by the Department in 1893, having been 
received through the Chicago Exposition...." <br>

"In Nebraska, where the [hemp] industry is being established, a new and important step has been taken in 
cutting the crop with an ordinary mowing machine. A simple attachment which bends the stalks over in the 
direction in which the machine is going facilitates the cutting...The cost of cutting hemp in this manner is 50 
cents per acre, as compared with $3 to $4 per acre, the rates paid for cutting by hand in Kentucky."  <br>

"The most important fact to be recorded in connection with the hemp industry during the past year is the 
successful operation of a machine brake in the fields of Kentucky. This machine breaks the retted stalks and 
cleans the fiber, producing clean, straight fiber equal to the best grades prepared on hand brakes, and it has a 
capacity of 1000 pounds or more of clean fiber per hour.  So far as we have any record, this is the first 
machine having sufficient capacity to be commercially practical that has cleaned bast fiber in an entirely 
satisfactory manner." <br>
USDA. 1905  Report of Office of Fiber Investigations. Bureau of Plant Industry. p. 145. <P>
 
"When the work with hemp was begun in Wisconsin, there were no satisfactory machines for harvesting, 
spreading, binding, or breaking. All of these processes were performed by hand. Due to such methods, the 
hemp industry in the United States had all but disappeared.  As it was realized from the very beginning of the 
work in Wisconsin that no permanent progress could be made so long as it was necessary to depend upon 
hand labor, immediate attention was given to solving the problem of power machinery. Nearly every kind of 
hemp machine was studied and tested. The obstacles were great, but through the cooperation of experienced 
hemp men and one large harvesting machinery company, this problem has been nearly solved. The hemp crop 
can now be handled entirely by machinery." <br>

"The organized hemp growers of Wisconsin, working in cooperation with the field agent of fiber 
investigations [Andrew Wright], have so improved the quality and standardized the grades of hemp fiber 
produced there that it has found a market even in dull times. The hemp acreage in that State has been kept up, 
although there has been a reduction in every other hemp-producing area throughout the world." <br>

"The crop of hempseed last fall, estimated at about 45,000 bushels, is the largest produced in the United States 
since 1859. A very large proportion of it was from improved strains developed by this bureau in the hempseed 
selection plats at Arlington and Yarrow Farms." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1917. Report of the Chief. p. 12.<P>
 
 
 
"Early maturing varieties, chiefly of Italian origin, are being grown at Madison, Wisconsin, in cooperation 
with the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. This is the third year of selection for some varieties, and 
the results give promise of the successful production in that State of seed of hemp fully equal to the Ferrara of 
northern Italy." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1918. Report of the Chief. p. 28.  <P>
 
"The second-generation hybrid Ferramington, combining the height and long internodes of Kymington with 
the earliness and heavy seed yield of Ferrara, gives promise of a good fiber type of hemp that may ripen seed 
as far north as Wisconsin." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1919. Report of the Chief. p. 21. <P>
 
"The work of breeding improved strains of hemp is being continued at Arlington Farm, Va., and all previous 
records were broken in the selection plats of 1919.  The three best strains, Kymington, Chington and 
Tochimington, averaged, respectively, 14 feet 11 inches, 15 feet 5 inches, and 15 feet 9 inches, while the 
tallest individual plant was 19 feet. The improvement by selection is shown not alone in increased height but 
also in longer internodes, yielding fiber of better quality and increased quantity." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1920. Report of the Chief. p. 26. <P>
 
"In 1929 three selected varieties of hemp (Michigan Early, Chinamington and Simple Leaf) were grown in 
comparison with unselected common Kentucky seed near Juneau, Wis. Each of the varieties had been 
developed by 10 years or more of selection from the progeny of individual plants. The yields of fiber per acre 
were as follows: Simple Leaf, 360 pounds; Michigan Early, 694 pounds; Chinamington, 1054 pounds; 
common Kentucky, 680 pounds." <br>
USDA. 1929. Bureau of Plant Industry, Annual Report. p. 27.<P>
 
"The hemp breeding work, carried on by the Bureau for more than 20 years, was discontinued in 1933, but 
practical results are still evident in commercial fields. A hemp grower in Kentucky reported a yield of 1750 
pounds per acre of clean, dew-retted fiber from 100 acres of the pedigreed variety Chinamington grown in 
1934. This is more than twice the average yield obtained from ordinary unselected hemp seed." <br>

<H3>THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF CRADLE TO GRAVE  
PLANNING TO THE END RESULT </H3>
<H4>March 30, 1943 </H4>
The New Deal Bureaucrats and their fellow "dollar a year" fiber racketeers of the War Production Board are 
now offering Hemp Marijuana (dope) narcotic to the American people instead of increased food production. 
The American people are footing the bill. <P>
In one of the most dastardly propositions ever "cooked" up the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the War 
Production Board are manipulating the proposition of a promotion and scheme to grow and produce hemp 
from a plant, outlawed by law, that is the fount of the insiduous [sic] drug known as Marijuana, the worst and 
most serious source of all (dope) narcotic evils afflicting children, in the schools and outside, and grown-ups 
alike in all walks of life. The fiber itself from this plant is worthless. The seeds from this plant fly far and wide. 
The resultant wild growth becomes dangerously uncontrollable. In the face of shortage and scarcity of labor, 
foodstuffs, linseed oil, fibers and other critical materials which are peculiarly being denied us, these corruptors
 [sic] of American life are now engaged in the promoting of 350,000 acres, erecting 100 buildings and building 
a large volume of equipment and machinery in a number of Mid-Western States for the production of this narcotic
 (dope) plant product, all of which must reach the staggering cost of $500,000,000 and end in catastrophic
 failure. A number of land-
grant educational institutions are in on this racket. The Commodity Credit Corporation and the War 
Production Board and the Defense Plant Corporation, through their own created socalled [sic] "War Hemp 
Industries, Inc., Agency," something new in the New Deal bureaucratic set-up, are running this (dope) 
narcotic show with private racketeers as undercover men. Large profits have been made already by them on 
the seeds by cheating and gipping [sic] the government. The financial "kill" is figured to be colossal for all the 
participants. The kill to agriculture, industry, (the choicest and most fertile land or soils are being demanded) 
and health and welfare of the American people is going to reach disastrous proportions from which recovery 
may never be found possible. Congressman Hampton P. Fulmer, Chairman, Agricultural Committee, and 
Congressman Paul Brown, overseeing the Commodity Credit Corporation, and certain other members of the 
Congress, among them Senators Harry S. Truman and Scott W. Lucas, and Donald 
M. Nelson, Chairman, War Production Board, and John R. Hutson, President of the government Commodity 
Credit Corporation, Agricultural Adjustment Administration, etc. (the latter active participant) are acquainted 
with the facts as are being described here and have been presented to them in detail. The power-pressure of 
the participants in this narcotic (dope) racket is obviously superior to the best interests of the American people 
even during these dangerous times of their sacrifices and sufferings at home and on the battle front. The truth 
of the above report is vouched for. Do you want this (dope) narcotic in your community? You are lined up for 
it. It is to be noted that increased acreage for guayule rubber has been stopped because of the acute food 
shortages but though rubber scarcities exist yet. <P>

NOTE:---This whole hemp marijuana racket will be dumped out of existence right after the war is over in 
accordance to with [sic] a statement from Washington, D.C., but obviously not before the "kill" in taxpayers' 
money has been made and the narcotic has been spread to dope them. <br>
