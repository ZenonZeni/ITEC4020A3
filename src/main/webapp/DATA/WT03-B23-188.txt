<H3>Common Law Negligence
</H3><P>Every contested auto accident involves two major issues - "liability"
and "damages."  Liability simply means that the other party must be legally
liable before he or she has any obligation to pay compensation for injuries.
 (Damages are discussed elsewhere at our web site.  Refer to our
<A HREF="civil.htm">civil page</A> for a listing of damages issues discussed.)
<P>Legal liability in a motor vehicle accident is most frequently based upon
the law of <STRONG>negligence</STRONG>.  Negligence is a concept that goes
back hundreds of years to the English "common law," and it  refers to failure
to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.
<P>The fact that an accident occurred does not necessarily mean anyone was
at fault; some accidents are legally considered unavoidable, meaning no one
is legally liable.  Although recent case law has made some changes, there
are four elements of negligence which traditionally must be present in every
case before the negligent person (sometimes referred to as a "tortfeasor")
has an obligation to pay damages:
<OL><LI>Duty
<LI>Breach of Duty
<LI>Causation
<LI>Damages
</OL><P>When you are operating a motor vehicle, you have a
<STRONG>duty</STRONG> to exercise reasonable care for the safety of others
on the road. That usually means that you must drive at speeds that are reasonable
under the circumstances, keep your vehicle under control, keep a lookout
for what is going on around you, obey traffic laws, etc.
<P>If you do not live up to your obligations, you have <STRONG>breached the
duty</STRONG>.  For example, imagine a straight stretch of road where normally
it is safe and legal to travel 45 MPH.  However, on a particular night the
fog is so thick that you can't see ten feet.  If you travel 45 MPH that night
and run into another vehicle, you have breached your duty to drive reasonably
under the circumstances.
<P>However, in order to be held legally liable under the law of negligence,
your breach of duty must be the <STRONG>cause of injury or damage to another
</STRONG>.  Continuing with the same example, if you travel 45 MPH down this
foggy road at night but do not strike another vehicle, hit a person, or in
any way cause any damage or injury, then you are not negligent.  You may
have violated the law and could receive a traffic citation, but you are not
negligent.
<P>Similarly, you might cause some type of incident but no damage to another
person, in which case you still would not be negligent.  Let us imagine that
in your race through the fog you strike a wall, damaging your car but causing
no damage to the wall.  You are not legally liable to anyone, since your
breach of duty has not caused any damage.
<P>Negligence law can be fairly simple, as when one driver is inattentive
and rearends another vehicle lawfully stopped at a red light.  However, it
can also be maddeningly complex, as when several people are involved,
eyewitnesses differ in their accounts, and no one can agree on the facts,
let alone what the legal obligations were.
<H3>Statutory Negligence
</H3><P>If the operator of a vehicle violates one of the rules of the road
and the violation causes an accident, that is referred to as statutory
negligence.  So for example, if the law prohibits passing over a solid line,
and you pass over a solid line anyway and hit an oncoming car, the operator
of that car would claim that you were negligent for violating the statute.
<P>Not every statutory violation makes you legally liable for an auto accident,
however. For examples, in most states the fact that a driver does not have
a legal drivers license, or is not insured as required by state law, does
not create legal liability for an accident.  It may, however, subject the
driver to other sanctions, depending upon state law.
<H3>Contributory Negligence and Comparative Negligence
</H3><P>Sometimes there is more than one person who is at fault in causing
an accident.  Whether an injured person can recover damages from a third
party depends upon how their particular state applies the law of contributory
and comparative negligence.
<P>Let's take a simple example.  John and Betty are each driving a car and
collide in an intersection where there are no stop signs, traffic lights
or other markings.  Each claims the other was going too fast for the
circumstances and not maintaining a proper lookout entering the intersection.
<P>Betty was injured in the accident and sues John, alleging that John was
negligent.  For his defense, John argues that Betty herself was negligent.
 The case is tried and goes to the jury.  Let's assume the jury would award
Betty damages for her injuries in the amount of $10,000.
<P>In a <EM>contributory negligence</EM> jurisdiction, if the jury finds
Betty was the least bit negligent and contributed to the accident, then Betty
would recover nothing.  Therefore, even if Betty is only 5% at fault and
John is 95% at fault, Betty recovers $0.
<P>In a <EM>comparative negligence</EM> jurisdiction, if a jury finds that
Betty is 5% at fault and John is 95% at fault, Betty would still be able
to recover, but her $10,000 in damages would be reduced by her 5% of fault,
so that Betty would recover only $9,500.
<P>Comparative negligence differs among states.  For example, if Betty is
found to be 50% at fault, and John 50% at fault, some comparative negligence
states would still allow Betty to recover $5,000 (50% of her damages), while
other states would prevent her from recovering at all because she is equally
at fault with the other driver.
<P>Still other states draw the line at 51%, following the principle that
a plaintiff who is MORE negligent than a defendant should not be able to
recover anything. For example, in Oregon, Betty would recover $5,000 if she
is 50% negligent, but if she is 51% negligent, she would recover nothing.
<P>Finally, there are about 13 states which have "pure comparative negligence"
law.  This means that a jury could conclude that Betty is 90% at fault for
the accident, and John was only 10% at fault, but Betty would still be able
to recover $1,000 (her damages reduced by 90%).
