<STRONG><H3>Compost it!</H3></STRONG>
     The  wheel  of  life just keeps on turning. From Death  comes  new
Life.  The art of making compost is really a science, nature's  science.
As  a  healing ointment for the soil, Compost is the result of  nature's
dedication  to  balance. Through watching and learning  about  the  way
nature makes compost, we can begin to understand our very own lives and
why things affect us the way they do. From Sir Howard to today, the art
of  composting has taken great steps towards a better understanding  of
the real process that takes place inside a compost pile.

<STRONG><H3>Purpose of Composting</H3></STRONG>
     There  are  two  major  reasons for making  compost..To  decompose
materials  down  to  a more workable and acceptable  form.  To  combine
materials in a favorable manner so as to increase nutritional levels as
well as increase beneficial bacteria activity, which when added to  the
soil will increase soil structure.

<STRONG><H3>How Composting works</H3></STRONG>
     Bacterial  action  in  a  compost pile is  the  basis  for  proper
composting.  It breaks down the various organic matter,  converting  it
into  compost while giving off heat and steam in the process.  It  also
makes available trace minerals to the plants.  Always provide plenty  of
oxygen (by stirring pile, aerate it) and plenty of natural nitrogen and
trace minerals. Water is very important; too much water will drown it and
not  enough will kill off the bacteria. There are many different  types
of  bacteria present in a compost heap depending on time elapsed
from  the start  of the pile. Different types of bacterial composition will occur
throughout  the composting process. The time of year also  determines
the rate at which the composting process occurs.
