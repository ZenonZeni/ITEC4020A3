<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 250</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Convention on Climate 
Change:<BR>
What does it say?</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is <A HREF = 
"fs201.html">the first binding international legal 
instrument</A> that deals directly with climate change.  </B>The Convention was 
adopted on 9 May 1992 after 15 months of tough negotiations by the UN-sponsored <A 
HREF = "fs209.html">Intergovernmental Negotiating 
Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC)</A>.  It was 
opened for signature at the Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro the following month, where it 
was signed by the representatives of 154 states and <A HREF = 
"fs211.html">the EEC</A> (now the EU).  By 19 June 1993, 
when the treaty was closed for signature, 165 states (plus the EEC) had signed.  The 50th 
ratification was received on 21 December 1993, triggering the Convention's entry into 
force 90 days later on 21 March 1994.<P>
<B>The Convention's ultimate objective is the "stabilization of greenhouse gas 
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system."  </B>To achieve this objective 
(Article 2), the Convention sets out a series of commitments.  The adequacy of these 
commitments will be periodically reviewed in light of the treaty's objective, new scientific 
findings, and the effectiveness of national climate change programmes.<P>
<B>As a framework treaty, the Convention sets out principles and general 
commitments, leaving more specific obligations to future legal instruments.</B>  
The <A HREF = "fs202.html">key principles</A> incorporated 
in the treaty are the precautionary principle, the common but differentiated responsibility 
of states (which assigns industrialised states the lead in combating climate change), and the 
importance of sustainable development (Article 3). The general commitments, which apply 
to both developed and developing countries, are to adopt national programmes for 
mitigating climate change; to develop adaptation strategies; to promote the sustainable 
management and conservation of greenhouse gas "sinks" (such as forests); to take climate 
change into account when setting relevant social, economic, and environmental policies; to 
cooperate in technical, scientific, and educational matters; and to promote scientific 
research and the exchange of information (Article 4, para. 1).<P>
<B>The Convention also establishes more specific obligations for particular 
categories of states.</B>  It distinguishes between members of the OECD1 (listed in  
Annex II to the Convention), countries in transition to a market economy (Eastern 
European countries which, together with the OECD countries, are listed in Annex I), and 
developing countries.  The Convention requires OECD countries to take the strongest 
measures, while the states in transition to a market economy are allowed a certain 
flexibility.  The Convention recognises that compliance by developing countries will 
depend on financial and technical assistance from developed countries; in addition, the 
needs of least developed countries and those that are particularly vulnerable to climate 
change for geographical reasons are given special consideration (Article 4, paras. 2-7).  
This approach is consistent with the widely recognised principle of the common but 
differentiated responsibility of states at different levels of development.<P>
<B>Developed countries and states in transition to a market economy must take the 
lead in adopting measures to combat climate change.</B>  They should take measures 
designed to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, with the aim of 
returning to 1990 emissions levels by the year 2000.  However, the differing economic 
circumstances of these countries are to be taken into account, and several states may 
together adopt a common, joint target.  (Article 4, para. 2).<P>
<B>The OECD countries must facilitate the transfer of technology and provide 
financial resources to developing countries to help them implement the 
Convention.</B>  The Convention requires OECD countries to finance the costs incurred 
by developing countries for submitting reports on their greenhouses gas emissions and 
measures for implementing the treaty.  This financial assistance is to be "new and 
additional", rather than redirected from existing development aid funds.  In addition, 
OECD countries are to provide financial resources for other Convention-related projects 
that are agreed to by both a developing country and the Convention's financial mechanism.  
This financial mechanism will initially be administered by the Global Environment Facility, 
but the Convention's parties could agree in the future to transfer the administration of the 
mechanism to another international body.  As for technology transfer, the Convention 
does not specify the terms of the transfers, such as whether they should be made on 
commercial or non-commercial terms.<P>
<B>The Convention establishes institutions to support efforts to carry out 
commitments and to monitor compliance</B>.  The Conference of the Parties (COP), 
in which all Parties (states that have ratified) are represented, is the Convention's supreme 
body.  It will meet for the first time in March 1995 and on a yearly basis thereafter.  It will 
promote and review the implementation of the Convention and, if  appropriate, adopt 
amendments, annexes, and protocols (Articles 7 and 15).  The Convention's Secretariat 
will provide administrative support and ensure the flow of information among Parties 
(Article 8); the INC/FCCC Secretariat is providing these services on an interim basis 
(Article 21).  The COP will be assisted by two subsidiary bodies, one for scientific and 
technological advice (SBSTA) and the other for implementation (SBI) (Articles 9 and 10).  
The COP can also set up additional bodies if it so decides.<P>
<B>The Climate Change Convention is a major step forward in the international 
response to climate change. </B>Much work remains to be done, however.  Many states 
still need to ratify the Convention and formulate national laws and policies that will enable 
them to meet their commitments.  Until the first session of the COP, the INC/FCCC will 
continue to meet and work on outstanding issues.  The COP itself will have an enormous 
amount of work to do to ensure that the Convention is a success in the years and decades 
to come. <P>
