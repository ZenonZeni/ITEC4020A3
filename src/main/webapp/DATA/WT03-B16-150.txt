</b><p>

<b>Most just take the bus</b>...The Hanoi branch of banking giant <b>ABN AMRO Bank</b> is sending a Vietnamese girl to Antarctica. She will join 33 other international "Young Explorers (YEs)" who plan to sail to Antarctica for 18 days. They will "sleep on the continent" for some nights, while learning about leadership and the environment. According to the bank, "It will be the first time in history a Vietnamese National walks to Antarctica." (The VBJ is currently accepting donations for her return passage.)<p>

<b>And to reciprocate, Antarctica sent this delegation to Vietnam</b>...Led by <b>Profs. James Barron</b> and <b>David Brady</b>, and student <b>Alan Hellawell</b>, 28 Stanford MBA students were spotted assessing HCMC and Hanoi in late December. One student lost his passport, but wasn't upset: his new one sports the highly-prestigious <b>"issued in Vietnam" logo</b>.<p>

<b>Now I REALLY don't believe in Santa</b>...It started out normal enough. The setting, Hanoi's <b>Daewoo Hotel</b> in Christmas Week, the event, a farewell dinner for outgoing IBM execs <b>Jeff and Linda Pace</b>. But it took a turn. 50 Hanoi IBMers witnessed a contest between terrible employee singers (and biased judges), a bouquet toss turned violent (<b>V-Trac's George Mack</b> was later apprehended), and a strangely composed Santa who reportedly scared a portion of the expat kid community. This Santa saucily beckoned guests onto his lap and doled out jokey presents, before a chill went through the crowd. "It didn't really look like Santa," said one party-goer." The beard looked like cottonballs, and Santa's coat went to his knees and looked like it was made in Hanoi." <b>Turned out to be IBM's Bill Scholey</b>.<p>

<b>Although I might have seen Santa here</b>...A Halloween ball thrown in a mountain-top former French cathedral and current Party Headquarters of would-be tourist destination Tam Dao was no place for starry-eyed tourists. Better suited were the 200 or so glassy-eyed French, English, and American expats who gave "village of wild beasts" natives an evening they won't soon forget.<p>

There were the slightly homely but high-kicking <b>Amstel</b> Girls, actually <b>Patrick Corcoran (Tate Distribution), Michael Tarr (IBM), Patrick Aronson (Motorola)</b> and <b>Hayama Kazuyuki (Design Company Ltd.)</b>, who took advantage of the four last vestiges of Amstel's passing interest in the market. There was the mysterious Hanoian who somehow packaged herself into the uniform of a local policeman stationed by the punchbowl. There was shoeshine man <b>Michael Mathes</b>, who actually gave an excellent shine. There was onstage, unrehearsed beer-slinging between a Frenchman in a wedding dress and a woman dressed in a tiara and bodysuit. There was the ad rep for a ministry paper draped in a certain red flag with a gold star, who's photograph was published, unfortunately for him.<p>

And afterward, there was the restaurant which allowed <b>visiting ghouls and queens</b> to take over the kitchen for a few hours. The next day local officials told organizers it was the best party ever held at the local HQ.<p>

<b>Did'ja know?</b>... It is a right of passage for men in Vietnam to drink "bia hoi," or fresh beer, at bia hoi stands found on every street, and is equally as common for older women to chew "cho," otherwise known as betel nuts, which stain their teeth a deep rose color and provide stimulation. A man chewing cho is scorned to no end. This is a relatively new social phenomenon. Before bia hoi was introduced by the Czechs 30 years ago, men were cho chompers as well.<p>

<b>Why does this sound funny?</b>...Included in HCMC <b>Amcham's</b> 12-page wish list to the US trade negotiators hammering out a trade deal with Vietnam: "US companies should be permitted to choose their own office and residential quarters at nondiscriminatory prices...The Vietnamese Government should not subsidize domestic enterprises in competition with US-invested enterprises...The practice of <b>midnight visits by local police</b> should be restricted or eliminated."<p>

<b>Your next meal is half price sir</b>...The mayor of Little Rock, <b>Bill Clinton's</b> hometown, in Hanoi with fellow mayors seeking sister cities, was unfortunate enough to order a burger at a newish California motif eatery. <b>Got so sick he had to be medevacked to Singapore</b>. As a result, Little Rock remains without a Vietnamese sister.<p>

<b>What did he say?</b>...An executive from Hanoi-based Committee for Overseas Vietnamese, correcting a foreign journalist who had been invited to hear how a new guideline affecting Viet Kieu is more liberal than the former one, despite a loyalty-to-the-system clause: "It doesn't mention anything about what you have in your mind."<p>

<b>Comings and goings</b>... <b>Tim Smith</b>, Services Development Manager for <b>DHL</b>, transferred from Hong Kong to HCMC...<b>Nigel Russell</b> moves from Hanoi to open and manage new <b>Phillips Fox</b> HCMC office... <b>Roy Morey, UNDP</b> Chief since 1991, back to the US, sole expat Hanoi dentist <b>Lisa Wilkinson</b>, back to England, <b>AWSJ</b> correspondent <b>Reginald Chua</b>, promoted to a HK editor slot, <b>Pepsi's John Mims</b>, <b>AFP's Bob Templer</b>, off to lecture at <b>Berkeley</b> in February, <b>Ashta's Hillary Becker</b> and Belgian fiancee <b>Vincent Meurrens</b>, formerly of <b>ABM AMRO</b>, to Antwerp, <b>Microsoft's Michael Davis</b>, promoted to regional marketing director,<b> Natalie Hilbe</b> and <b>Xavier Desseaux</b> went back to Paris, as did <b>Mathieu Renard</b>...and congrats to <b>US Embassy</b> officer <b>Doug Patterson</b>, whose wife had a baby boy.<p>
