<center><H2><STRONG>MID-TERM ALERT!!!</STRONG></H2></center>
<p>
	In case you haven't noticed...midterms are almost here!  Midterm grades are due in on October 16).  Before you encounter your midterm exams, it would be helpful to get your study habits in order.  For many courses, midterm grades are a significant percentage of the course grade.  Here's your chance to determine your destiny!  What is your semester grade destined to be?  You have control to make that grade happen!

<center><H3>Memory Techniques</H3></center>
<p>
Here are 20 techniques to help you improve your memory:
<ul>
<li><B>Organize your information.</B>
<ul>
<li>Learn from the general to the specific.
</ul>
<li><B>Start with the big picture and work to the details.</B>
<ul>
<li>Make it meaningful.  Find connections between what you are studying and what interests you.
<li>Create associations.  Relate new information to information you already know.</ul>
<li><B>Use your body.</B>
<ul>
<li>Learn it once, actively.  Keep your body alert while you study to help recall.
<li>Relax.  You can be alert and relaxed -- be free of tension and focus on the task at hand.
<li>Create pictures.  Use illustrations to draw connections between information you are learning.
<li>Recite and repeat.  Repeat key concepts aloud so you read and hear the concept.
<li>Write it down.  Writing a note to yourself helps you remember an idea.</ul>
<li><B>Use your brain.</B>
<ul>
<li>Reduce interference.  Turn off the stereo, lock the door, and turn on the answering machine!
<li>Use daylight.  Many people can concentrate more effectively during the day.
<li>Overlearn.  When you learn more than you think you'll need you'll be more confident on exams.
<li>Escape the short-term memory trap. 
<li>Distribute learning.  Do three 2-hour study sessions instead of one 6-hour session.
<li>Be aware of attitudes.  If you have a bad attitude about a subject, your learning will be impaired.
<li>Choose what not to store in memory.  Don't overload with details; keep the core concepts.
<li>Combine memory techniques.</ul>
<li><B>Recall it.</B>
<ul>
<li>Remember something else.  Recall an associated term if you can't recall a specific term or idea.
<li>Notice when you do remember.  Take note of how you best store memory and use that method to recall it.
<li>Use it before you lose it.  Refresh your memory periodically; don't cram!
<li>You never forget.  Keep the attitude that you can remember and you will.
</ul>
</ul>

<center><H2>Reading for Success</H2></center>
<p>
The key idea behind muscle reading is that your textbooks have something you want.  They have knowledge and valuable information.  Sometimes the value is so buried that extracting it requires skills and energy.<p>
	Muscle reading is a three-phase technique you can use to accomplish that extraction.  Each of the three phases has three steps.  To assist your recall of all nine steps, memorize three short sentences:
<ul>
<li>Pry out questions.
<li>Root up answers.
<li>Recite, review, and review again.
</ul><p>
<B>	P = Preview.</B>  Survey your assigned reading and look for familiar concepts, facts, or ideas.  Keep these facts in mind to relate to new information.  This will help you step into the reading.  <B>O = Outline.</B>  It only takes about 10 seconds to mentally outline the reading your facing.  Outlining will help you keep information in order and will help the information make sense.  <B>Q = Questions.</B>  Approach the new information with questions.  What do you want to know about the information?  If you don't understand a concept, write specific questions about it.<p> 
<B>	R = Read.</B>  Opening your book does not make reading happen.  You have to visualize the material, maybe even read it out loud.  Think about how the subject feels, looks, or applies to your life.  <B>U = Underline.</B>  This is your chance to write in books!  Read before you underline so you only underline key concepts.  Use a highlighter -- it will get your attention better than a pen.  <B>A = Answer.</B>  As you read, get the answers to your questions.<p>
	<B>R (this time) = Recite.</B>  Talk to yourself or someone else about what you have read.  <B>R (this time) = Review and Review Again.</B>  Do your first review of the materials within 24 hours of reading the information.  This can be short -- 15 minutes reviewing a 2 hour reading.  Then review again, weekly and monthly.  Even if your final exam is not cumulative, you need to review information to get a full understanding of the course.

<center><H3>Notice Your Note-taking</H3></center>
<p>
	You just spent 3 course sessions taking notes.  The weekend is here.  You chunk your books on your desk and head for the nearest distraction.  The question is...will you ever get any return on the 3 hours (or more!) you just invested in note-taking?  Do you find yourself only reviewing (err, that's cramming) your notes the night before an exam?  Notice your habits.  Make your notes noteworthy.  Take the following quiz to check your note quotient.  For each item, rate yourself according to this scale:
<OL><li>always<li>often<li>sometimes<li>seldom<li>never
</OL>
<p>
<ul>
<li>I review my notes immediately after class.	

<li>I conduct weekly reviews of my notes.		
	
<li>I make summary sheets of my notes.		

<li>I edit my notes within 24 hours.			

<li>Before class, I conduct a brief review of the notes I took in the previous class.</ul><p>

	If your note quotient is not up to par (i.e., you are in never-never land), take time now to build your skills. Academic Affairs, the Counseling Center, and your academic advisor can help you enhance your study skills.
