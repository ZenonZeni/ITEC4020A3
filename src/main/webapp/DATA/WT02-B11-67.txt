<P>This detailed study, published in October 1995, provides the very latest
intelligence and analysis on the gamut of issues that are relevant to companies
and financial institutions engaged in power project development in Brazil.</P>
<P>The study answers questions about the scope of Brazil's power privatization
process; the rules of the game for private involvement; the key players in the
federal and state power sectors; the state of regulatory reform; how the tariff
system is structured; the role of thermoelectricity in a culture of hydro power
and the expanding field for self producers and independent producers.</P>
<P>This report contains a complete list of power projects to be offered in
public bidding between 1996-2004 and the complete list of concessions under
consideration for exclusive use hydroelectric plants.  The report also presents
more than two dozen charts and tables detailing information on the electricity
market, tariffs, investment needs, facilities envisioned by Eletrobras, and much
more.</P>
