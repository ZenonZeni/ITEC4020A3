<H2><A NAME="_Toc370012918"><TT>Mexican Tomatoes and Avocados</TT>

</A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US farm value of fresh vegetables

and melons was $7.4 billion in 1995, and Florida's production

of six winter fresh vegetables--tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers,

snap beans, eggplant, and squash--represented about 10 percent

of the total.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Florida produced 2.5 billion pounds of

these six fresh vegetables in 1995, other states produced 3.8

billion pounds, and 2.6 billion pounds were imported--about three-fourths

of these fresh vegetable imports were from Mexico. Mexico exported

about $1.5 billion of fruits and vegetables in 1995, including

$600 million of tomatoes.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US imported $3.1 billion worth of

horticultural products from its NAFTA partners in 1995, including

$400 million worth of Mexican tomatoes. About 80 percent of Mexican

horticultural imports were fresh produce, versus 50 percent of

Canadian imports.</FONT></TT>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012919"><TT>Tomatoes</TT> </A></H3>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In April 1996, Florida tomato producers

filed a petition alleging that Mexico &quot;dumped&quot; tomatoes

in the US at less than their cost of production--they needed only

show that there was &quot;some injury&quot; from imported tomatoes

to win this case. The US Department of Commerce investigated to

determine, e.g., whether Mexican tomatoes were sold at the same

prices in Canada, Mexico, and the US in 1995-96, and planned to

issue its decision on October 7, 1996.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">However, the Commerce Department announced

it was suspending the anti-dumping case on October 11, 1996, because

Mexico agreed to a price floor for its tomato exports--Mexican

growers would charge at least $0.21 per pound, or $5.17 for a

25-pound box for their tomatoes shipped to the US--and Florida

growers agreed to suspend their dumping case. Mexican growers

must ratify the agreement.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Before the decision, Mexican growers

predicted that a 30 percent anti-dumping tariff would eliminate

500,000 jobs in Mexico.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many observers expected Florida to win

the dumping case, largely because the Clinton administration,

in a bid for Florida's 25 electoral votes, permitted the Florida

growers to mix two marketing years in providing data on Florida

and Mexican costs of production and market shares. The Florida

Department of Agriculture spent $1.5 million to press the tomato-growers'

complaints against Mexican tomatoes.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">If Florida had won the dumping case,

the US could have imposed dumping sanctions on Mexican tomatoes,

adding, for example, a 10 percent &quot;dumping margin&quot; to

the tomatoes imported in 1996-97. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Mexico could have retaliated against

US-produced goods, the $3 billion worth apparel and wood products

that the US exported to Mexico in 1995 were suggested.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">On July 2, 1996, the International Trade

Commission rejected by a 4-1 vote a petition from Florida growers

that alleged that the US winter tomato and pepper industries were

being &quot;substantially hurt&quot; by normal tomato and pepper

imports from Mexico, Canada, and the Netherlands. If the ITC had

agreed that US producers were being &quot;substantially&quot;

hurt by imports, President Clinton could have imposed increased

tariffs or taken other steps to limit imports under Section 201

of the Trade Act.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The 16.5 pounds of fresh tomatoes that

the average American eats each year, include about 4.6 pounds

produced in Florida, seven pounds produced in other states, especially

California, and 4.6 imported pounds, usually from Mexico.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">During the first 10 months of 1995, Mexican

agricultural exports to the United States, excluding grains, rose

by 42 percent to $ 2.9 billion, while US agricultural exports

to Mexico fell 44 percent to $ 724 million. Mexico supplies about

three-fourths of the imported vegetables consumed in the US, and

Mexican-born workers are about three-fourths of the US hand-harvest

vegetable labor force.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In the winter of 1996, prices for 25-pound

boxes of tomatoes fell from the usual $10 to $12 to $3, below

the $8 cost of production in Florida, and the $6 cost of production

in Mexico. Florida planted 47,000 acres of tomatoes in 1995, and

harvested 14 billion pounds of tomatoes. In 1995, the US imported

1.3 billion pounds of tomatoes from Mexico worth $400 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Florida and Mexico compete for less than

half the year--for the five months between December and April--with

the most severe competition in February-March. Most observers

attribute Florida's falling share of the winter vegetable market

to weather and to Mexico's &quot;correct&quot; technological choices.

</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Until the early 1990s, both Florida and

Mexico produced mostly &quot;mature green&quot; tomatoes, which

means that green tomatoes were picked into buckets, sorted and

packed into cartons, and then gassed to turn them pink before

being shipped to retail stores. However, Mexico began in the 1990s

to plant &quot;vine-ripe&quot; tomato varieties that can be picked

pink, and reportedly taste better than mature green tomatoes.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">On September 24, the House Agriculture

Committee's Risk Management and Specialty Crops Subcommittee held

a hearing on the Florida growers trade complaints in Lantana,

Florida. At the hearing, it was asserted that Florida tomato workers

have average hourly earnings of $6.77 per hour, and that Mexican

pickers average $0.50 per hour. About one-third of tomato production

costs are for labor.</FONT></TT>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012920"><TT>Avocados</TT> </A></H3>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Mexico produces about 45 percent of the

world's avocados, some 800,000 tons per year from almost 220,000

acres, but Mexican avocados have been banned from the US since

1914. Some 100,000 workers are employed on 8,000 avocado farms

in Michocan, which produces about 85 percent of Mexican avocados

and is one the major states of origin for Mexican migrants headed

to the US.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">California has about 6,000 avocado growers

and 65,000 acres of avocados, up sharply from 20,000 acres in

1960. San Diego county produces about half of all US avocados,

which were worth $250 million in 1994. Mexico has both higher

yields and lower costs--average Mexican yields are about one-third

higher than California yields, 7.6 tons per hectare, versus five

tons per hectare in the US.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">As a result of the ban on Mexican avocados

in the US, a box of US-grown avocados in the US sells for about

$30, while a box of Mexican-grown avocados in Canada sells for

about $8.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US imports about one percent of its

annual avocado consumption, and Mexico exports about five percent

of the avocados it produces. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1994, the USDA proposed to lift the

ban on imported Mexican avocados. Mexican growers certified to

ship avocados to the US would have their trees inspected in Mexico

and USDA personnel would also check for pests in packing plants.

Mexican growers would pay for these USDA inspections. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Under the proposal, Mexican avocados

could be imported only to 19 Midwest and Northeastern states during

the months of November to February, when the cold weather should

prevent any of the pests from surviving.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">If the import ban were lifted, one simulation

projected a four to eight percent decrease in US avocado acreage

and a drop of 10 to 20 percent in US avocado prices.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The ban on Mexican avocados was expected

to be lifted in November 1996, but California avocado growers

spent $300,000 on newspaper ads to persuade USDA to continue to

study the issue of pests slipping past inspectors, surviving the

New England winter and wreaking havoc in California. The delay

will likely mean that no Mexican avocados can be imported until

November 1997.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">USDA regulations on avocado imports require

that there be an &quot;absence of infestations of injurious insects

known to attack fruits and vegetables&quot; in the area of origin

of the fruit during the 12 months before importation.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A box of Mexican avocados sells for about

$8 in Canada, while a box of US avocados in the US sells for $30.

Canadians pay $0.50 to $0.60 per Mexican avocado in retail stores,

while US consumers often pay $1 each for California avocados.

About five percent of Mexico's fresh avocados are exported.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Mexicans consume about four times more

fresh produce per capita than Americans, in part because fewer

Mexican have the freezers and microwaves associated with frozen

vegetables.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Costa Rica supplied 25 percent of the

8.5 billion pounds of US banana imports in 1995.</FONT></TT>
