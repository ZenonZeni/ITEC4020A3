Investing With Asset Allocation Mutual Funds  </H2><P>
<HR>

The benefits of spreading holdings among the three basic asset classes--stocks, bonds, and cash--has become evident to many investors. What is not so evident is how to accomplish this allocation.<P>


If you are not inclined toward the do-it-yourself approach of combining individual selections in each category, one possibility is to consider all-weather mutual funds that perform this task for you. Three types of mutual funds are designed to spread their money over different asset classes: asset allocation funds, balanced funds, and funds of funds.<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Asset Allocation Funds:</STRONG> These funds initially establish predefined percentage ranges for their holdings of stocks, bonds, and cash. They also may mix in the shares of some inflation-resistant companies, including gold producers, natural resource and energy companies, and real estate investment trusts. They then make adjustments in their weights as market conditions change.<P>


Most of these funds have a global orientation and include foreign as well as domestic securities in their portfolios. This diversifies the investment mix across stock markets and currencies as well as sectors--including emerging market debt and equity.<P>


Most multi-asset portfolio managers will gradually adjust the category weights as relative asset class valuations--or market outlooks--change, reallocating perhaps 10% to 20% of the portfolio at a time. <P>


Individual funds can differ greatly, so each portfolio you consider has to be analyzed carefully. How they manage their stocks, how they structure their bonds, and the extent to which they invest in foreign securities are among the important variables.<P>


Performance and other data for eight no-load asset allocation portfolios are reported in the table at the end of this article, which contains comparative performance numbers for the Vanguard 500 Fund, an index fund that replicates the Standard & Poor's 500. The most striking fact revealed by these figures is the heterogeneity of the group in terms of assets, expense ratios, performance, and volatility.<P>


In theory, asset allocation funds should decline less than the S&P 500 during market corrections, since they are diversified in other asset classes. The market was not off that badly in the first half of 1994, although it is interesting to see how the group fared during our recent correction. Six of the eight slid further than the 3.5% decline in the Vanguard 500. That's because most of the asset groups these funds work with slipped in tandem during the first half of the year, which is not that common.<P>


Standard deviation is the best measure of portfolio volatility for asset allocation funds. Standard deviation measures the amount actual returns varied around the average; a higher standard deviation indicates higher volatility. All the funds in the table have lower standard deviations than the Vanguard 500's 9.9%, ranging from 5.3% to 8.2%.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Balanced Funds:</STRONG> These portfolios trace their roots back to the 1920s and 1930s. They split their holdings between stocks and bonds according to a benchmark stock/bond ratio, such as 60/40. Generally, a balanced fund would hold at least 25% of its assets in bonds and 25% in stocks. Some place more emphasis on equities, others lean toward bonds.<P>


Balanced funds also include modest cash holdings and may mix in some convertible securities and preferred stock. They may also include a modest amount of foreign securities. The typical balanced portfolio sticks much more closely to a predefined mix than the usual asset allocation fund, so its performance tends to relate more directly to the returns on bonds and stocks than to the manager's forecasting ability. Although the group has traditionally been conservative, individual funds sometimes dabble in smaller stocks and long-duration bonds to try to enhance returns.<P>


Balanced funds generally performed very well during most of the 1980s and the early 1990s because there was a strong bull market in bonds as well as stocks. Investors should not expect such generous returns over the next decade or so.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Funds of Funds:</STRONG> These portfolios invest in other mutual funds with varying objectives including growth stocks, U.S. government bonds, foreign stocks, and so on. These types of funds would appeal to the first-time investor or to those with limited assets looking for one-stop diversification.<P>
</UL>

There are two basic ways in which all-weather funds can be used by individuals.<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>An All-In-One Investment:</STRONG> Generally asset allocation funds, balanced funds, and funds of funds are appropriate for individuals who want to invest a substantial portion (or even all) of their assets in a single fund. These people may be looking for convenience--perhaps they don't like keeping track of individual funds and don't want to be involved in building their own portfolios and adjusting positions. <P>


All-weather funds could also be an attractive alternative for parents saving for a child's college education who want to use one broadly diversified, stable fund to accumulate the savings. However, if the child is very young and you're looking at 15 or more years to build the assets, straight equity funds are generally best.<P>


<LI><STRONG>A Portfolio "Core":</STRONG> Some people may want to use an asset allocation fund as a core holding amounting to about 30% to 40% of their total investment assets. They can then tailor their portfolio to their own circumstances, adding several other funds that invest in areas that the asset allocation fund doesn't include, such as municipal bonds. Funds targeting areas that the asset allocation fund does include but that the individual wants to give more emphasis to could also be added. With the core approach, you can hold your portfolio to a more manageable number of funds, while the asset allocation fund is making gradual adjustments for you based on changing market conditions.<P>
</UL>

All-weather funds are not for everyone. All-in-one funds would not ordinarily be as appropriate for larger investors who are already spreading their money across, say, eight to 20 different funds. Asset allocation funds make it more difficult for individuals who wish to determine their own percentage allocations to keep track of their current portfolio breakdowns. The larger the size of your portfolio and the more involved you are with your investments, the more advisable it becomes to make your own all-weather portfolio.<P>


If you should decide to invest in one or more of the all-weather funds, keep these guidelines in mind.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The most flexible asset allocation funds are simply aggressive market timers. Market timing generally doesn't work and leads to high portfolio turnover and significant tax consequences. Look for mutual funds that make more modest, gradual adjustments in their allocations.<P>


<LI>Watch out for mutual funds that appear to be overly cautious, always holding large positions in Treasury bills and precious metals. Their long-run total returns could be inadequate.<P>


<LI>Try to determine whether the manager actively selects stocks or merely attempts to track the performance of an index, such as the S&P 500. Funds that base the equity portion of their assets on an index are more conservative. If the stock component is actively managed, you want to know something about the manager's stock-picking ability.<P>


<LI>Examine the stock and bond portions individually. Morningstar provides separate style boxes for the stock and bond components of the asset allocation and balanced funds it tracks. You can see the size of stocks the manager emphasizes, any growth or value orientation, and the average maturity and credit quality of the bonds.<P>


<LI>Since some people place a big chunk of their long-term money into an asset allocation portfolio, top-quality management is essential. These funds are difficult to run. The manager has to decide not only how to weight the different groups, but also what securities to buy within each diverse group. Some funds have several managers who each specialize in a particular area.<P>


<LI>If you're planning on investing a substantial sum in an asset allocation fund, you need to be particularly careful. It would be advisable to split the investment between the two best funds you can find. That way you are not betting the ranch on a single manager (or team) and you'll probably experience lower volatility.<P>


<LI>Watch the expense ratio. Asset allocation funds tend to have above-average expenses. The average expense ratio for the asset allocation funds tracked by Morningstar is 1.46%, which is above the 1.17% average for its entire mutual fund universe. Expenses will be more crucial with the prospects of more modest stock and bond returns during the next decade or so.<P>
