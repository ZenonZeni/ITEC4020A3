Management Communications and Control, Inc. (MCCI) is a small software tool development company focused on graphical programming technology for large parallel Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. MCCI has a ten year corporate history which includes successful development of a graphical programming software tool for the Navy's standard signal processor and support of several large defense contractors in the application of graphical programming methods in SONAR system designs. MCCI is developing a commercial graphical DSP programming toolset under an ARPA funded program and a Navy SBIR Phase II contract.<P>

MCCI's autocoding toolset supports DSP graphical programming in a format similar to block diagrams or management pert charts. Our design tools support development of top level program designs from the user's graphical specifications. Detailed design and coding tools automatically generate DSP code for the complete application. Included run time utility programs perform the functions of application management, process execution control, and data communications making user  development of run time support unnecessary. Our toolset generates high performance, production quality code with execution efficiency that meets or exceeds that of hand optimized production code. We will offer an unique capability to support graphical programming and produce production quality code. Using our toolset, users will realize a tenfold decrease in DSP software development costs to produce high performance production code.<P>
