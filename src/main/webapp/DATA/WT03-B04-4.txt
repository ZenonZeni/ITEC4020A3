Dear Editor: Correcting facts on ECCs

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Antonio G. M. La Vina

This refers to today's (Sept. 12) issue of BusinessWorld which ran an
item entitled "DENR sitting on the ECCs of four major energy projects."

We would like to correct the impression brought about by the
abovementioned title in view of the following facts: 1. The ECC for the
Sunrise Power Corporation was granted by the DENR just yesterday, Sept.
11, 1996. The project involves the construction and operation phases of
a 23-megawatt diesel/bunker power plant to serve the Petrochemical
Products Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-Petrochemical
Products Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-Petrochemical
Development Corp. Industrial Estate in Brgy. Batangas II, Mariveles,
Bataan. 2. The application of the Tarlac Power Corp. is for the
construction of a 30 MW bunker fired power plant expansion of the
existing 6.4 MW Heavy Fuel Engine Power Generating Plant in Bgy. Sto.
Nino, Tarlac, Tarlac, to augment Tarlac's power needs. The EIA review
Committee, on 5 September 1996, forwarded its recommendation to the
DENR Central Office and is now being reviewed for  consideration/approval
by the Secretary. 3.

The San Pascual Cogeneration Project, which involves the construction
and operation of a combined cycle cogeneration plant at the Caltex
Batangas Refinery in San Pascual, Batangas has been recommended by the
EMB on 29 July 1996 for issuance of ECC.

However, some clarifications with the proponent and the Review Committee
are necessary with respect to land ownership and land classification. 4.
The proposal for the Lake Mainit Hydroelectric Project of the Agusan Power
Corp. is a 22-MW Hydroelectric Power Plant in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte.

On 6 September 1996, the DENR Central Office returned the papers to the
EMB and the EIA Review Committee in view of necessary information on the
project's impact area, considering that the project will involve among
others the boring of a 3.2 km. tunnel under the Malimono Ridge from
Lake Mainit.

The Department wishes to clarify that the Environmental Impact
Assessment System involves the submission by the proponents of Impact
Statements which are subjected to the evaluation of an independent
group of experts. Considering the variability of local conditions and
the extent and variety of projects we receive, it is expected that
information in addition to the standard set of documents submitted will
be required as evaluation takes place, leading to the impression that
the DENR does not act expeditiously.

In view of this, we have been trying to fast track evaluation and tried
to improve on the system. We are presently revising the EIA guidelines
with the objective of streamlining the procedures.

We hope the above explains the issue. ANTONIO G.M. LA VINA
Undersecretary for Legal, Legislative Affairs and Attached Agencies, &
OIC, Undersecretary for Environment and Programs Development

Dear Editor: Nuclear test ban

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Maria Athena Ronquillo

Greenpeace welcomes the overwhelming approval by the United Nations
General Assembly (UNGA) of a "zero-yield" Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
resolution last September 10 in New York. We now urge the five nuclear
powers (US, UK, Russia, France and China) to sign the treaty as soon as
it is opened for signature, and to commit themselves to pursuing
complete nuclear disarmament.

Twenty-five years ago this month, Greenpeace was launched to peacefully
protest nuclear weapons testing. We view this treaty as a milestone in
the history of the nuclear age and an extraordinary way to mark our
anniversary.

We must now channel the overwhelming worldwide momentum toward the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into efforts to eliminate all nuclear
weapons.

The Philippines, together with Indonesia, Malaysia and other ASEAN
countries helped small countries propel the overwhelming signing of the
UN resolution.

The overwhelming vote at the United Nations is a moral victory for the
peace movement, for the little people everywhere and for all Asian NGO
colleagues who have campaigned for an end to nuclear testing for the
past 50 years.

The treaty can take effect only after the signature and ratification of
44 specific countries, including India, which so far refuses to sign.
It is, therefore, essential that the US and the four other nuclear
powers ratify the treaty soonest and affirm their commitment never to
test nuclear weapons again.

On behalf of Greenpeace International, MARIA ATHENA RONQUILLO Regional
Energy Campaigner, Southeast Asia #49 Matatag St., Bgy. Pinyahan, QC

Dear Editor: Clarification

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Jesus Matubis Jr.

BusinessWorld carried the story about Sec. Robert Z. Barbers'
memorandum delineating the responsibilities of the two undersecretaries
of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Messrs. Alvin
G. Dans, for Peace and Order, and Manuel R. Sanchez for Local
Government.

While we are thankful for the exposure, we wish to correct however
certain inaccuracies in the story, among them the incorrect
interpretation conveyed by the accompanying headline (DILG's Barbers
dumps Dans for Sanchez) that Undersecretary Dans was "dumped," or, as
such a term normally implies, "removed," and the reference in the story
to a supposed rift between Dans and Director Serafin Benaldo as the
probable cause of Dans' transfer.

To set the record straight, Dans himself was the one who requested that
he be made responsible for the Interior or Peace and Order sector of
the DILG. This request Secretary Barbers acceded to.

Thus, while Dans may have had a policy difference with Benaldo on the
funding of the proposed Community Development Assistance Project, as
mentioned in the story, this was not at all the basis for Secretary
Barbers' decision.

We hope this will clarify matters. JESUS MATUBIS JR. Director
Department of the Interior and Local Government

Dear Editor: He"ll smoke "em

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Joel B. Ramos

Congratulations! Through your columnist, Daniel F. DeLong, someone has
decided to stand up to all of the abuse thrown on us smokers. In his
column last week, Mr. DeLong pointed out the restrictions and he
destroyed the myths spread by the ill-informed members of society.

If you think that you can help yourself by giving up cigarettes, then
you need to do so. Leave the rest of us alone!

Next time you commute, please look at all the people who are forced to
cover their noses so that the exhaust fumes of the buses and jeepneys
don't kill them. These are the killers of this society.

I do have 'em and I do plan to continue smoking 'em. JOEL B. RAMOS

Across the Board: Graft watch - 2

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By Ismael G. Khan, Jr.

Two columns ago (BW, Sept. 5, 1996) I wrote about a nascent movement
that is designed to mount a constant "graft watch" on those activities
of government that readily lend themselves to graft and corruption.
Former presidents of the Personnel Management Association of the
Philippines (PMAP) and that organization's Society of Fellows are in
the vanguard of this effort.

In a meeting yesterday, the former PMAP presidents, led by Greg
Imperial and Wency Malabanan, began to map out doable plans to assist
the Ramos Administration - assuming that it would welcome this
proffered assistance - in sustaining its avowed campaign to go hammer
and thongs against officials and employees who betrayed or are
betraying the public trust.

Much on the administration's political will and sincerity to ensure the
success of this campaign.

Despite the fact that the Philippines has probably the toughest laws
against public malfeasance and misfeasance, there has been no serious
prosecution under any of those laws. Both the PCGG and the Ombudsman
are proving to be no match to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of
these criminal civil servants and their co-conspirators in private
business.

While hidden wealth may take some doing, unexplained wealth should not
be too difficult to pin down if our so-called "graft-busters" truly set
their minds and hearts to it. A citizens' "Graft Watch" may just light
a fire in their behind and put it in their belly.

Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and
Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) are two of
the world's most successful anti-corruption agencies, either of which
can serve as a very useful and workable model for the Philippines.

It is not by happenstance that both Hong Kong and Singapore are
paragons of a graft-free society where laws are actually enforced
regardless of who gets hurt, and crooked officials are actually put
behind bars. It is interesting to know, for example, that the
establishment of Hong Kong's ICAC in 1974 was precipitated by rampant
police corruption in the Crown Colony.

Dr. Raymond Pomerlau of the San Francisco State University has made a
career of studying graft and corruption in Asia, particularly in Korea,
Taiwan, and China. He has identified a number of strategies which he
maintains are imperative in the battle against institutionalized
corruption in government. Among them: "1. Corrupt activity must be
treated seriously and not dressed up in the rhetoric of morality.
Political will and an avowed policy of implementation must be secured.
Adequate budgetary and independently established human resources must
be pressed into service. Compre-hensive investigative and innovative
legal measures must be consistent with due process laws. "2.
Appropriate administrative infrastructure must be invoked. Fundamental
changes in public attitudes must be encouraged and an ethical value
system must be prompted. Application of punishment for corrupt
practices must be exercised swiftly, equitably, and without exception.
"3. Boundaries between government and business must be distanced.
Contributions to political campaigns must be legalized under stringent
guidelines. Social encounters must not turn into money-denominated
exchanges. "4. Pursuit of private gain must never be at the expense of
public duty. 'Honest graft' and 'dishonest graft' must be called
corruption. Laws must remain the most important means of combat
corruption. Principles of transparency must be institutionalized in the
body politic. "5. And ,finally, national integrity must be avowed as
the linchpin of the nation's well-being."

If the foregoing moral "infrastructure" could be put in place in our
country, there will be hope yet that we can prevail in the war against
graft and corruption.

Upshot: For 30 pieces of silver

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Bernardo V. Lopez

For a lousy 30 pieces of silver, Okinawan Governor Masahide Ota decided
to retain the controversial US bases. The Japanese government offered
oodles of development aid so that Ota would capitulate and reverse his
stand to get rid of the bases. He could not resist the offer,
nullifying an overwhelming plebiscite where about 90 per cent of
Okinawans voted to get rid of the bases. That's the way the cookie
crumbles.

Bases withdrawal was replaced with "bases reduction," which really
amounts to nothing, just a few square meters lopped off to appease the
angry crowd. The strong protests of the Okinawans stems from the rape
last year of a school girl by three American GIs, which shocked the
conservative Okinawan community.

Ota led the protest but gave up when 30 pieces of silver, or a whopping
$45.8 million, was laid at his feet. Okinawa is one of the poorest
places in Japan with average income of half of Tokyo's.

The base leases held by about 3,000 landowners mostly opposed to the
base expire in May 1997. This may just make the Ota decision useless.
Some of the biggest in the eastern hemisphere since Subic was lost, the
Okinawa bases are home to 47,000 American soldiers, the largest
concentration of US troops in the entire Asia Pacific.

The strong anti-base feeling among the Japanese is also due to the
lesson of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Japan has one of the most resilient
anti-nuclear movements in the world. Many feel that Japan may just be
sucked into a regional nuclear confrontation because of the bases.
Ironically, Japan also has one of the most conservative military-minded
rulers who believe an alliance with the American superpower is the key
to peace in the Pacific.

Learning a lesson from Filipinos who got rid of the Subic naval base
without batting an eyelash, the Americans made sure this would not
happen in Japan, a crucial military partner in any confrontation with
China or Russia. The strong bilateral pressure from the Americans on
Japan's central government to retain the bases was, of course, realized
by the 30 pieces of silver, which is a drop in the bucket considering
how much the Americans spend to maintain 47,000 in the base. It is easy
for the US to bribe the 3,000 landowners or use force to renew the
leases in the future.

A Japanese journalist last year reported on a syndicate involving
Filipinos and Americans which has been secretly exporting Filipino
children to a neighborhood near the base, reportedly for the R&R of
American GIs.

The rape of the Japanese school girl is nothing compared to the mass
pedophilia that may be happening clandestinely in Okinawa, if the
allegation are true.

It was a useless trip last week to Subic for Okinawan officials led by
Mashiko Takara, chair of the Special Committee on Development of
Evacuated Military-Used Lands. They were eager to have their own base
withdrawal in their country. They came to study the base conversion
model at Subic with Filipino executives giving a lecture on the how-to
of base conversion.

Okinawa holds 40 of the 100 US bases scattered throughout Japan,
including its version of Clark Field, the Kadena Air Force Base. Over
and above the American bases, Japan has the most powerful and modern
air force in the entire Pacific, which has forced China to modernize
its air force in response.

Ninety per cent of the escalation of strategic weapons in the Pacific
is due to an overly superior Japanese air force with the Americans
benefiting in terms of billions of dollars worth of sale of the most
sophisticated airplanes.

Japan is the biggest arms spender by far in the entire Pacific,
believing that its future as a world economic power depends on it. Some
observers believe however this will cause its downfall.

Ironically, this thinking in the military and government centers
contrasts greatly with the essential anti-military and anti-nuclear
mentality of the Japanese public due to the trauma of World War II. The
problem is, the public has very little clout in the decisions upstairs
in spite of the effective mass sit-down strikes against the Yokosuka
naval base where the US "neither confirms or denies" the presence of
nuclear weapons.

With the loss of Subic, the strategic value of the Japanese US bases
has tripled as there is a gap between the bases in Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean (now participating actively in attacks against Iraq) and
Guam and the Japanese bases. Geopolitics dictate that the Americans
keep the Chinese sleeping giant at bay at intervals across its massive
coastal area. The geopolitical wisdom of containing a rival giant is,
however, questionable.

The Americans and the Japanese are the hawks of the Pacific who will
cause the next major confrontation because of their massive escalation
of weaponry. The chances of a bases withdrawal in Japan is practically
nil if the Japanese bureaucrats keep their medieval shogun mentality
contrary to the will of the public, which is the only only force that
can stop them.

The View from Taft: Effective leadership in a changing environment

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By John Malliris

In today's complex business environment - increasing global
competition, deregulation, political and economic protectionism - the
companies which implement continuous changes have competitive advantage
for survival.

Leadership is the most critical factor to implement such changes and
the driving force that causes an organization to stretch beyond its
normal range of performance.

The behavioral characteristics of a leader may be broadly categorized
into (1) charismatic and (2) instrumental.

The elements of charismatic behavior are knowledge, vision and energy.
A leader possessing these qualities is able to elicit employee support
and commitment. He is able to direct individual objectives, values,
aspirations and aggressiveness toward organizational benefits.

The elements of instrumental behavior are structuring, controlling and
appraisal. A leader is said to have these qualities if he is able to
define standards, clarify degree of authority and responsibility,
establish systems and processes to monitor behavior and results,
prescribe corrective actions and give meritorious rewards.

The combination of charismatic and instrumental behavioral
characteristics comprises effective leadership, which is necessary to
get meaningful changes and the best results.

The combination of these leadership characteristics is manifested in an
organization in its (1) dynamism, (2) personal interaction, (3)
integration of individual and group goals, and (4) structural fluidity.

Dynamism

In contrast to traditional management, leadership does not always
create consistency. It produces movement, action and change tough: a) a
high degree of directional intensity - new objectives, a vision for the
future and the commitment of people to power and purpose; b) alignment
and communication - direction to achieve the vision; and c) motivation
- adoption of new values and discarding of old habits.

Personal Interaction

A successful organization calls for the leader's personal participation
and interaction with people. It means asking the right people the right
questions and listening to their opinions as well as to facts. For
example, instead of simply relying on statistics in submitted reports,
a leader can directly ask a service engineer to determine the time
spent in the field against the time spent in the office.

Integration of Individual and Group Goals

Effective leaders give meaning to the people in their organization by:
a) making them understand what a particular vision means to them; b)
assisting individuals across the organization to find a greater purpose
in their working environment; c) empowering people to become involved
in the change effort and be responsible for getting extraordinary
results; d) adopting a certain style so others can be comfortable with
them.

Structure Fluidity

Effective leadership is also dependent on the leader's ability to
develop high-level management groups or leadership teams whose members
interact principally to share information and make decisions. This
relieves the leader of part of his work load and at the same time
provides an excellent cross-disciplinary training ground for future
chief operating officers.

Many organizations have such management teams, composed of a collection
of senior level managers who more or less function together.
Unfortunately, a member occasionally throws his weight around to
conceal his inefficiencies.

High-performance organizations have "real" leadership teams with
members who are equally committed to a common purpose or goal, who
trust one another, and who hold themselves mutually accountable for
decision making.

In summary, an effective leader should be able to harness both his
charismatic and instrumental characteristics to steer his organization
to success in these times of rapid environmental changes.

Even before the Thalia fervor has cooled down, her Sergio, nee Eduardo

Capetillo speaks English fluently. That's a relief. At least, we don't
have to groan through the incompetent translations fed to us in
Thalia's case. To recall, at the Araneta Coliseum concert, Thalia was
moved to tears when a giant birthday cake was wheeled onto the stage in
advance celebration of her birthday (Aug. 26). She told the crowd that
her tears (lagrimas) were like "perlas de amor," that she was offering

Reader Kenneth Yu is fuming mad. His telephone works sporadically and
"yet, PLDT has the gall to bill me for the period my phone was not
working." He said the first time he complained, a lineman came and said
the problem was a defective line and that this would be checked.
However, when nothing happened after a few days, Mr. Yu called up PLDT
service and was told the problem was not with the line but with the
conduit line inside his building. This went on for two to three weeks.
Finally, Mr. Yu said he was told by a lineman that PLDT service wanted
its "statistics" to be manageable, meaning complaints about defective
lines should be within a specific number. Any complaint beyond the
accepted statistical boundary is logged under another category. If
true, can the public be further enlightened on this technicality?

ShopTalk: Mismanaged

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

The Department of Agriculture faces the possibility of losing
fertilizer grants from Japan and Canada. Negotiated by then National
Food and Agriculture Council chief Domingo F. Panganiban in the early
'70s, the grants were supposed to be bidded out to fertilizer companies
which would then sell them to end-users, paying the government the cost
of the chemical plus a margin. When Mr. Panganiban left government
service with the entry of the Aquino regime in 1987, he said he turned
over about P780 million in proceeds from the fertilizer grants. During
the Aquino regime, the bidding process was junked and the National
Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the grant's implementing agency,
opted to award the grant to basically three groups. As of last
accounting, these groups owe the government about P300 million. Of this
P300 million, about P120 million is owed by Sanduguan, a farmers'
organization. Canada is apparently disturbed by these developments and
is now considering coursing its fertilizer grants through private
fertilizer companies. Petty graft it can live with, but not the
magnitude of corruption in the handling of the grant. Tokyo has also
expressed concern and has required projects to benefit from its grant
to get its prior approval. Again, tsk, tsk...

Time was when talk of constitutional changes were never even given a
second thought. Recall how lawmakers allied with the administration
were up in arms when a Palace initiative to introduce amendments to the
1987 Philippine Constitution was leaked to the press. Now, the same
people have made a 180-degree turn: they are virtually crying out to
the world that there will be changes in the Constitution and that
President Ramos himself appears to be sending out the message. For one,
several Lakas-NUCD congressmen had observed that many unnecessary
provincial trips are being undertaken by the chief executive. Another
congressman claimed it was Malacanang which authored all the ruckus to
discredit Congress and the judicial system. Yes, even the opposition
had reluctantly admitted, the Constitution will be amended via the
circuitous route of a people's initiative. And it is expected to begin
in next May's barangay elections.

Unlike in Manila where taxi drivers take 12-hour shifts, taxi drivers

for Cebuano taxi drivers to take shabu. And the riding public knows it.
And what do you know, there is also no effort on the part of drivers to
hide that they are taking this upper. Tourists without cars and who
want to check out night spots in the Queen City of the South must be a
little more careful. Taking a cab may not be the safest way to get

Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino continues to face some
obstacles in his bid to become the next secretary-general of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). While four out of the
seven member states of ASEAN are throwing their support behind Mr.
Severino's bid, the organization's current chief, Datu Ajit Singh of
Malaysia, is persistently lobbying for a second five-year term when his
ends in 1998. Sources told BusinessWorld the majority of the ASEAN
members want to see some changes in the organization. They want the
Malaysian diplomat to give way to Mr. Severino, who they believe could
inject some vigor and new ideas to the laid-back attitude of the
secretariat. Apparently, ASEAN's chief caretaker is afraid of facing
early retirement from the diplomatic service. Sources said the
Malaysian diplomat can no longer go back to the Malaysian foreign
service because he is of retirable age. The Philippine government wants
to secure the commitment of its colleagues in ASEAN this December
during the informal summit in Jakarta for Mr. Severino's bid. ASEAN is
expected to formally announce its decision for the new
secretary-general by July next year during the group's annual
ministerial meetings, to be held in Kuala Lumpur.

One Voice: What is love?

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Vicky P. Garchitorena

She is small for her age and not given to much talk, at least not in
front of strangers: Rhona Mahilum, the 8-year-old girl who went into
their burning hut time and again in order to bring out her little
siblings. Her shoulders are hunched up as a result of the scarring of
the tissues from her neck, contracting the connecting muscles.

Her mother is a small woman and just as quiet.

She had to walk 15 kilometers carrying Rhona over her shoulders like a
lamb in order to avoid further destroying the burned flesh on her back.
She ignored her husband's command to just bury the child, whom he
thought was already dead. She walked thus to the nearest hospital to
seek treatment for her little girl.

Two small women. Two great heroines.

What is it that made them do what they did? What drove Rhona to
overcome her natural instinct for self-preservation and to brave the
heat of the flames in order to save her brothers and sisters? How could
she ignore the agony of her burning back? Whence came that courage come
in one so young?

Perhaps the maternal instinct of the mother was more understandable.
She refused to give up hope. She refused to give up her child. Rhona,
on the other hand, risked her own life. Not once but four times. And
she's only eight years old.

When I went to visit Rhona at the Ospital ng Maynila, two
representatives from the Readers' Digest happened to be there, too. One
of them asked me where I thought that act of courage of Rhona came
from. I could only say that it must have been her great love for her
brothers and sisters that made her do it.

I believe that God has given each of us the capacity to love. That love
manifests itself in different ways in our different relationships in
life. But, perhaps, some have been given a greater capacity than
others. Rhona certainly had it in large measure. As did her mother.

I can only imagine that the mother must have shown Rhona and the family
a quality of quiet love and caring that was deeply impressed in the
little girl's mind and heart.

Perhaps she was reflecting that same love and concern when she forgot
herself and her own safety totally and completely in order to save the
lives of her loved ones.

It has been said that "a greater love than this no man has, that he lay
down his life for another."

Rhona has shown us that pure and selfless love such as that Christ
showed us still exists in this world.

Her example should be held up for all Filipinos, indeed for all
mankind, to see and appreciate so that we do not lose hope for our
nature. Her example should silence the cynics who insist that looking
out for number one is the only valid lifestyle for our modern day.

Rhona was to have been operated on this week to remove the scar tissue
and to release the muscles that had contracted along her neck and
shoulders. After a few more months to ensure her good health, she will
be released from the hospital where she has been staying with her
mother and two younger sisters.

The trust fund that Mayor Alfredo Lim of Manila started has grown to
about P1.7 million. Its earnings are intended to ensure the health and
education of the children.

They are fortunate that such a Trust Fund has been set up. All too
often, we see similar donations that are simply frittered away by a
family that is not used to handling and managing such large amounts of
funds.

There is, of course, the concern that Rhona may become spoiled by all
the attention and all the largesse that is being heaped upon her. It
has also been reported that a movie is being planned on her act of
great daring and heroism and selflessness.

We can only pray that her mother will have the character and the
courage to see to it that she remains a loving and simple child.

Rhona's act of great love reaffirms our humanity. She has shown us what
all of us are capable of. She has shown us how to be heroes. She has
shown us the true meaning of love.

My Turn: Caught in traffic on a rainy night

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By Daniel F. DeLong

It's probably a matter of sheer, stupid luck. When it rains, somehow I
manage to find reasons not to go out.

But the man who coined the phrase, "It's better to be lucky than good,"
didn't have driving in the rain here in Metro Manila on his mind when
he uttered those words.

Because, as we all know, luck has a tendency to run out.

I had to go to the New World Hotel in Makati on a recent afternoon for
a story. It turned out there wasn't a story.

On the way home, it began to rain. I knew I was in trouble sitting at
the corner of Ayala Avenue and EDSA, waiting to turn left so I could
return to New Manila.

To begin with, it took the light nearly 10 minutes to switch to green.

We all moved like greyhounds through the pounding rain, for one block.
From Buendia to the house, a distance of 10 kilometers, it took another
96 minutes.

By now, the tape I was listening to had already finished one side and
it was running to the conclusion so that the machine could flip it to
the other side.

The cars were moving like something out of a nightmare. Slow, slower
and S-L-O-W-E-S-T. Finally, no movement at all.

I had the air conditioner turned on so that I didn't have to breathe
the horrible exhaust fumes coming from the buses to the right that
seemed intent on blocking progress for all of mankind. The windows were
beginning to steam up.

"We're all blind!" I thought. "How can anyone see anything?" So I
rolled each one down and back again to improve vision. It still looked
the same as it did before.

About 20 minutes later I cleared up the windows again and I happened to
look off to the left at a bunch of signboards that were grouped tightly
together.

Two of the advertisements were for shoes. "Yes," I thought to myself,
"walking would probably be better - even in this confounded rain that
doesn't seem to want to stop."

The bottom signboard was from a major distributor of condoms.

"That board should have been there 20 years ago," I mumbled to no one.
"If it had, perhaps traffic tonight would be better."

Despite the fact that we were moving, if you want to call it that, so
slowly that I was passed three times by the same vendor - yes, street
vendors walking on EDSA - I continually found myself in between lanes.

I try as much as possible to pick a lane on the road and stay there
throughout my trip. Sometimes, however, what we want and what we do are
not the same things.

A dear friend of mine has a fantasy about driving here. He would like
to build a car with reinforced steel that could absorb impact, and then
driving with a photographer and his insurance man, go out on the roads
and operate his motor vehicle like they do in the US.

In case you don't know, a man's place in a lane is something that
cannot be violated. If, for some strange reason it is, there will be
trouble.

My friend theorizes that he would be a one-man teaching crew, showing
the locals how it is supposed to be done.

So what would life be without fantasies?

On EDSA, it's the buses. They ruin it for everyone. Why doesn't the
government take control? It would be better to put up with inefficiency
than to suffer the current conditions.

Also to blame is Henry Sy, Sr. While he keeps building malls, he isn't
doing it fast enough for the population to spread out.

Once I asked him why doesn't he build more roads so that the people can
get to his malls to spend their money faster?

He simply smiled, shrugged his shoulders and simply moved on.

As I approached Megamall, I noted that the beginning of the end is
coming for the Ortigas Center, which is up in arms over a 300% increase
in property tax valuation.

"What," I asked my steering wheel, "will happen when they build out all
of the open space and there is nowhere to park a car?"

Already there is no water there because all the high-rise buildings
have sucked the precious commodity out of the ground.

Why do the developers here always worry about the most important things
after the damage has been done?

On Ortigas itself, heading through Greenhills, the problem is now
oversized trucks. There are container trucks, Coke trucks and trucks
hauling building material to construction sites. Why can't these things
wait until the commuters get home?

The trucks hauling materials to construction sites should wait until
after 10 p.m. No one is going to do anything with their load until the
next day anyway.

I've got a fantasy, too. But I can't share it with anyone because it's
probably illegal.

GrandAir to begin US flights starting February "97

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 19

By Marifi S. Jara

Grand International Airways, Inc. (GrandAir) is gearing up to begin
flights to the United States by February next year notwithstanding the
opposition lodged by flag-carrier Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL).

Eliseo Hizon, executive assistant to GrandAir's president and chief
executive officer, said in an interview that the airline has already
secured a permit from the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and that
they are just preparing several requirements.

"We have the permission from the US this December but probably it may
not push through because we have to meet certain requirements from the
FAA. We are working on those right now," Mr. Hizon said.

These requirements include the company's business plan, aviation safety
documents, and an environmental impact study, among others.

For its initial US operations, GrandAir plans to cover the
Manila-Honolulu-Los Angeles route with daily flights.

Mr. Hizon also said that once they begin their US services, they will
be looking at possible tie-ups with US carriers. "Not strategic
alliances, not yet. Maybe we will go for interline agreements which are
similar to code sharing and other forms of bilateral agreements. This
will all be possible as early as February 1997 as soon as we complete
our requirements."

Mr. Hizon said their permit for US flights, also known as the
transpacific route, was issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
"about two or three months ago."

Officials of CAB could not be reached for confirmation as of press time.

Last June, PAL wrote a letter to the CAB asserting that GrandAir has no
right to fly more international routes until it receives a Certificate
of Public Convenience and Safety (CPCS).

The CPCS, issued by the government, serves as a permanent license for
operating in a service-oriented industry like aviation.

GrandAir is currently running under a temporary operating permit.

PAL also said in its letter that GrandAir should first secure from
government an official designation as the country's second national
carrier.

The Office of the President, which has to power to make such
designations, has yet to act on CAB's recommendation that GrandAir be
named a national carrier.

Earlier, GrandAir chief operating officer Angelo V. Balverde stressed
their planned international routes will cover the Philippine's air
traffic slots left unserviced by PAL. On the other hand, PAL has filed
an application before the CAB seeking to cover all of the country's
entitlements to the US under the RP-US Air Services Agreement.

GrandAir's current international operations consists of thrice a week
Manila-Hong Kong-Manila and Subic-Hong Kong-Subic flights.

Grand Air was granted a temporary operating permit to cover domestic
routes in December 1994 and October last year for international
destinations. Using a Boeing 737 aircraft, Grand Air's first
international flight bound for Hong Kong took off last April 3.

CAB recently approved GrandAir's application for Manila-Seoul-Manila
and Manila-Taipei-Manila flights. The airline is preparing to start
covering these routes before the end of the year.

The Panlilio-owned Grand Air, which has proven to be PAL's toughest
competitor since it started operations in March 1995, is also planning
flights to other Asian countries like Japan and Singapore which are
considered among the most lucrative routes.

In the domestic front, Grand Air currently serves flights to Cebu,
Davao, Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro with planned expansions to Iloilo,
Puerto Princesa, Kalibo, General Santos and Bacolod.

In another development, GrandAir has opposed the application of Air
Philippines Corp. for international flights, asserting the company is
financially and technically unfit for such services.

In a letter filed before the CAB last week, GrandAir, through its legal
counsel Roberto Rafael Lucila said, "The applicant is not fit and
qualified to engage in the business of international scheduled air
transportation services."

"The articles of incorporation of Air Philippines, Inc. provides that
the authorized capital stock of the corporation is P16 million - Hence,
this application fails to state the legal and financial fitness of the
applicant," the letter said.

The Panlilio-owned GrandAir, currently the only airline aside from
Philippine Airlines operating international flights, also cited the
recent grounding of Air Philippines as a sign of technical incompetence.

"Applicant does not possess the technical capability and fitness to
undertake the services applied for as its present domestic services
have been reportedly suspended by the Air Transportation (ATO)
recently, on the grounds of aviation safety requirements," Mr. Lucila
said.

The Subic-based Air Philippines was grounded by the ATO early this
month following a series of minor landing accidents. The ATO later
declared the airline unsafe. Upon compliance with requirements, ATO
lifted the suspension and allowed the airline to continue its services.

Air Philippines has resumed operations but it will still be under
government observation for a period of 30 days.

GrandAir further said Air Philippines failed to establish in its
application the need for a third international carrier for the country
as indicated in Executive Order No. 219.

Under EO 109, the law liberalizing the air transport industry, two
international carriers shall be designated as official carriers.

Additional airlines will only be designated if the first two fail to
meet passenger demand and are unable to use all the country's flight
entitlements under Air Service Agreements (ASA) with other countries.

"The application does not allege the urgent need for a new
international air carrier along the routes already being serviced or
applied for by GrandAir and Philippine Airlines. Specifically,
applicant failed to allege that the present designated carriers do not
service the total frequency entitlements of the Philippines under ASAs
or similar arrangement," Mr. Lucila said.

Air Philippines is majority-owned by plastics magnate William
Gatchalian and in part by three foreign groups. It currently flies to
Subic, Puerto Princesa, Davao, Tacloban, and Cagayan de Oro. It plans
to operate flights to the United States and countries within the Asia
Pacific region.

Philippine Ports Authority calls for selective liberalization

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18

Relaxing the rules on interisland shipping to allow the participation
of foreign-owned vessels should be implemented on a regional basis, the
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) said.

In a letter, PPA general manager Carlos Agustin told the Maritime
Industry Authority (Marina) that lifting the cabotage law should be
done in stages since a unilateral declaration will only favor foreign
shipping lines to the disadvantage of the local sector.

A memorandum of agreement (MOA) is pending approval by officials of the
Marina and the Bureau of Customs (BoC). It will allow non-Filipinos to
engage in coastwise trade which is being vigorously opposed by local
shipowners.

The PPA said that before implementing the proposal, both offices should
conduct intensive consultations with industry experts to determine its
constitutionality.

A similar appeal was made by the Domestic Shipping Association which
asked the Marina and the BoC to secure the official opinion of the
Department of Justice. However, the two are still inclined to go ahead
with the MOA, saying they have direct jurisdiction.

The PPA said a reciprocity clause wherein the same arrangement can also
be availed of by Filipino firms should be explored by the two agencies,
adding that not all ports in the country may be able to meet the
requirements of prospective clients.

Local firms have raised apprehensions that the move will cut them out
of the competition since foreign vessels can charge domestic rates
without paying the same taxes required from domestic ships.

Currently, foreign ships can only pick up and unload cargoes at the
Manila International Container Terminal and South Harbor. This setup,
officials said, slows down the flow of cargo traffic and stifles the
growth of exporters.

Based on the MOA, foreign vessels that will engage in coastwise trade
will have to secure two clearances, one from the BoC and another from
the Marina. A vessel authorized to unload import cargoes at a local
port will be allowed to pick up export cargoes destined for the
vessel's port of call abroad or to another local port.

Officials said the MOA will merely provide an alternative since the
final choice will depend on shippers.

Financing woes plague bus firms

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18

By Conrad M. Carino

Are bus companies becoming unattractive to banks and financing
companies? Industry sources said the bus industry, already hurting from
multiple factors, is finding it difficult to finance the acquisition of
new buses. Likewise, creditors are having a hard time collecting loans
from bus companies.

Alex Yague, president of the Provincial Bus Operators Association of
the Philippines (PBOAP) said banks are becoming very selective in
financing bus acquisitions since many companies are already hurting.

"Tingnan mo, ang daming mga bulok na bus na tumatakbo sa (Look around,
there are a lot of dilapidated buses plying) Metro Manila," he declared.

Other bus companies said the industry is hurting from factors such as
the recent wage increases, diesel price hikes and the unified vehicle
reduction program (UVRP).

They said that unlike jeepney operators, bus companies employ office
staff and a regular maintenance work force which are paid fixed wages.
In addition, prices of spare parts and new buses are no longer cheap. A
12-meter air-conditioned bus now costs around P4 million, while an
11-meter air-conditioned unit sells at around P2.7 million.

Financing companies are willing to shoulder up to 70% of the
acquisition cost with an interest rate of around 18% to 20%. The most
acceptable collateral for bus acquisitions is real estate. The maximum
period for installment payments is three years.

Unlike automobile buyers, bus companies are not offered of
zero-interest loans, low downpayment and easy installment plans.

"Hindi iyan uso sa industriya (that is not practiced in the industry),"
a source who requested anonymity told BusinessWorld.

A check with SOH Technologies Corp., one of the top three manufacturers
of brake drums for heavy vehicles, also points to hard times for the
bus industry. Company president Leon Ang said this is evidenced by the
slow cash collections from his customers.

Most maintenance parts of buses are locally fabricated. These include
brake drums, brake shoes, suspension leafs, suspension mountings and
air cleaners.

Of the problems confronting the bus industry, the UVRP may have the
most telling effect. Metro Manila bus operators contend that the scheme
has resulted to an average loss of almost P2,000 per vehicle per day.

On the other hand, provincial bus operators say they incur a loss of up
to P5,000 per vehicle per day because their units cannot exit nor enter
Metro Manila-based terminals.

Mr. Yague said losses of bus companies from the UVRP are expected to be
reduced since the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) agreed to
issue exemption stickers to 10% of bus operators' fleets. The stickers
are yet to be issued to the bus operators.

If worse comes to worse, bus companies will start shutting down and the
big ones are not exempted. Mr. Yague said one bus company with more
than 250 units stopped operations early this year due to bankruptcy.

He said the industry hopes no other bus company will suffer this fate
since this will make banks become more wary in providing loans.

Share prices dip on profit taking

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 12

By Rosemarie V. Francisco

Profit takers took advantage of the correction in the US blue chips
marker Dow Jones Industrials last Tuesday to collect their gains in the
local market after its two-day uptrend.

"People took it as a cue to harvest profits," said Monique Lecaros,
analyst of Armstrong Securities, Inc.

The composite index fell 11.13 points, or 0.34%, to 3,248.59. The
market was weak throughout the session, sagging 25.66 points at the
most to 3,234.06 during intraday trades.

Value turnover narrowed 19.94% to P2.49 billion. If the block sales
totalling P373.87 million were taken out, peso volume will amount to
P2.11 billion, still within the P2 billion mark. This reflects some
level of foreign participation in the market.

Volume of shares eased 9.49% to 18.51 billion. Of the total 171 issues
traded, decliners routed advancers, 66 to 37, while 68 were unchanged.

The local market simply mirrored the movement in the Dow Jones. The US
market closed marginally lower 0.37 point to 5,888.83 last Tuesday due
to a news report which stated that eight out of 12 regional Federal
Bank presidents have asked for an increase of at least 0.25 percentage
point in the discount rate on direct loans to banks. The US bond market
also reacted as the long bond ended weaker.

Investors took this as a sign that the US Federal Reserve is keen on
increasing interest rates during its Sept. 24 meeting even if economic
data released last week showed that the growth of the US economy is
still manageable and will not put pressure on inflation.

However, Ms. Lecaros noted that the Dow Jones did not correct
significantly. "It was merely a hangover after the party," she said.
The Dow Jones posted record highs for two consecutive days earlier this
week. Previously, analysts said the local market will follow the trend
set by the Dow Jones and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT)
listed in New York. But yesterday, the market ignored the uptick in
PLDT of $0.625 to $64.25 and focused instead on the US market's key
indicator. Local PLDT shares slipped 1.18% to P1,675.

Ms. Lecaros believes the local market's slide yesterday was expected
and that investors just used the Dow Jones' correction as a reason to
heed cash calls. "This market has risen too much in the past two days.
The rise is so unsettling," she said. Thus, the trading results
yesterday was partly due to a technical correction, negative sentiments
after the Dow Jones slide, and profit taking, she added.

The Phisix gained 66.04 points in the past two days after weeks of
sluggish trades.

While the bullish sentiments of foreign fund managers towards the
country is not waning, they are taking a cautious view of Asian markets
given the possible hike in US interest rates.

One sector at a disadvantage is the property stocks. "The strategy of
foreign fund managers is to stay out of the property stocks until the
uncertainty in the US market is not erased," Ms. Lecaros said. Property
issues are sensitive to the movement in interest rates. When the US
implements a rate hike, local monetary authorities will have to adjust
local interest rates accordingly to prevent foreign funds from flowing
out of the country.

In turn, high interest rates do not augur well for property companies
as the cost of housing loans will become too pricey for consumers.

"Things will continue to be uncertain until the 24th... As long as
there are uncertainties in interest rates, we will continue to be just
paced by the Dow Jones," Ms. Lecaros said.

Trades will remain cautious. Stocks in the consumer and industrial
counter will be picked up by foreign fund managers as these are the
likely performers next year given their solid fundamentals, the analyst
said. Foreign fund managers are entering the country to position for
1997.

Sectoral averages were mixed. The commercial and industrial index
weakened 33.70 points, or 0.76% to 4,391.26, the mining sector by 14.49
points, or 0.50%, to 2,865.46. The property sector edged up 1.44
points, or 0.86%, to 168.87, the oil counter gained 0.03 point, or
0.47%, to 6.41.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. A slid 2.38% to P4,100 while B shares
were untraded. Stockholders of the firm approved the capital buildup
program of the bank which includes an increase in the authorized
capital stock to P8 billion from P800 million.

Bacnotan Cement added 2.94% to P17.50. The firm will be merging with
Central Cement Corp., with Bacnotan as the surviving entity.

Index stock Ayala Land gained 3.08% to P33.50. The firm will list
additional shares totalling 692.53 million to cover its 50% stock
dividend. Listing of the shares will be on Sept. 24.

Filinvest Land eased 4.26% to P9, same with Fil-Estate Land, 2.11% to
P23.25. New listing Ever Gotesco slid 1.69% to P1.16. Uniwide Holdings
remained at P5.30. Solid Group eased 1.64% to P6.00.

Dept of Envt and Natural Resources orders Cebu chemical firm to cease
operations

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Digna B. Verbo-Velasco

Cenapro Chemical Corp. has to stop operations as the Pollution
Adjudication Board (PAB) of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) recently upheld its earlier decision to slap a cease
and desist order (CDO) against the firm.

PAB ruled Cenapro's plant in Cebu had continuously violated
Presidential Decree 984, otherwise known as the Anti-Pollution Law, by
emitting smoke which failed DENR's opacity standard.

PAB had issued the first CDO on the project in February 1993.

Cenapro immediately filed a motion for reconsideration, seeking a
temporary lifting order (TLO) to enable it to rehabilitate
anti-pollution devices.

PAB granted a 90-day TLO 16 days afterwards on condition Cenapro would
rehabilitate anti-pollution devices, pay the performance bond, and
adopt interim remedial measures to minimize pollution.

The TLO also directed DENR Region 7 to serve the order and monitor the
Cenapro's compliance.

Almost three and half years have passed since PAB issued the first TLO
and DENR Region 7 seemed satisfied with Cenapro's compliance with TLO
conditions.

DENR Region 7's recent inquiry, however, showed Cenapro's operations
continued to cause air pollution.

DENR Central Office and PAB concluded Cenapro's "management showed
unwillingness to comply with their commitments... and is deliberately
not complying and has no intention to comply with pollution laws."

PAB promptly ruled Cenapro's defiance merited reimposition of the
original CDO and corresponding fines on Cenapro.

But a source said the "ample time" PAB had given the firm to rectify
its systems may have demonstrated PAB's own "administrative lapses."

New beach resort and golf course to rise in Cebu

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Dirk J. Barreveld

CEBU CITY - San Remegio town, a small fishing and farming community 110
kilometers away from here, may soon sport a world-class beach resort
and golf course.

Lars Lofgren, chairman of Sun Reno Development Corp. which will start
this project by early next year, said the other day it will take his
firm three years to complete the project.

San Remegio's beach had been inaccessible due to bad roads, until an
Asian Development Bank-funded project had modernized the main road. Mr.
Lofgren said his firm envisions the Sun Reno Golf and Country Club to
attract international visitors, mainly from Europe, and to provide
employment for at least 1,000 local residents. This project includes a
350-room hotel, 150 bungalows, a marina, a beach park and swimming
pools.

The project is still waiting for the Environment Management Bureau to
issue its environment compliance certificate.

San Remegio mayor Artemio Masbate said the San Remegio municipal
council has already endorsed the project. The council has also issued a
resolution converting the site from agricultural to a tourism area.
This is the second tourism project in the area to avail of the
three-year tax holiday the municipal government grants to locators with
capital of at least P5 million.

But observers are cautious, saying this project will succeed only if
plans were well prepared.

They recalled the case of Cebu Green Island, a Japanese investment
group that established a similar facility in Badian on Cebu's west
coast. This project halted after only a few years of operation due to
financial difficulty. San Remegio residents have urged their municipal
council to ensure Sun Reno's project will be properly constructed and
managed.

Gov"t fails to stop illegal quarrying in Or. Mindoro

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Grave V. de Guzman

Government officials may have allowed illegal quarrying to continue
along the coast of barangay San Antonio, Gloria in Oriental Mindoro.

"Residents of the area have asked their local officials to act on the
matter but... quarrying operations continue. In fact, hollow blocks
molding is also done in the area," Demokratikong Kilusang Magbubukid ng
Pilipinas (DKMP) president Jaime Tadeo told BusinessWorld yesterday.

He said the Mining Act of 1995 prohibits quarrying within 200 meters
from the shoreline because this causes erosion.

Mr. Tadeo said quarrying in the area which began in 1991 has adversely
affected coconut farms. He said these operations have uprooted at least
100 coconut trees.

Mr. Tadeo claimed poor enforcement of the law by the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and "connivance" of local
officials and the Philippine National Police (PNP) had allowed the
quarry's owner to proceed with operations.

"To stop quarrying activities and to confiscate pay loaders and trucks,
DENR Region 4 should order community environment and natural resources
officers to coordinate with the PNP," Mr. Tadeo said.

He also claimed Mr. Capistrano was able to secure permit to operate
from erring local government officials. He explained only local
government units can grant permits to quarry in areas measuring less
than five hectares.

DKMP has asked DENR to investigate this matter.

Fishkill hounds Hopewell plant

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Miguel M. Cortez

PAGBILAO - Seventy hectares of mangrove became a deathbed for schools
of fish when toxic liquid burst from walls of an ash lagoon of a
coal-fired power plant here last August 30.

A source at the site told BusinessWorld a breach in the dike of ash
lagoon number two of the 700-megawatt $850-million plant here of
Hopewell Power (Phils.) Corp. was responsible for the death of such
varieties as lapu-lapu, banak and samaral. This plant, which is the
country's biggest coal-fired thermal power plant, forms part of the
15-year power development program of the National Power Corp. (Napocor).

The source said plant workers had repaired the breach, which measured
five meters long and five m. deep, after gathering the dead fish. One
worker who cooked some of the lapu-lapu refrained from eating more,
saying the meat tasted "like mud."

Plant station manager George Markin declined to be interviewed, saying
he was not in a position to answer inquiries on the accident.

BusinessWorld called offices of the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources and Hopewell in Manila but their officers were all
attending meetings. One Napocor official, who requested anonymity,
tried to distance Napocor from this issue, saying Hopewell's Pagbilao
plant had begun operations only last June and that Napocor was supposed
to only monitor the plant's operations.

But the same plant's test run in September last year had reportedly
resulted in a fishkill in the area. The Quezon provincial board, which
then attributed the fishkill to the plant's allegedly indiscriminate
dumping of toxic waste in nearby waters, passed a resolution two months
later threatening to close down the plant should inquiries prove the
plant's adverse impact on the environment.

Plant officials had then denied responsibility for the reported
fishkill, saying the plant observed environment laws. One official
said, for instance, the plant's environment compliance certificate
allowed Hopewell to convert the affected mangrove into an ash lagoon.

The same official said a tripartite monitoring group meets every month
to scrutinize the plant's activities, including those related to
anti-pollution efforts. But BusinessWorld discovered the group, which
used to meet at the Pagbilao town hall, has not convened for several
months now.

Pagbilao councilor Jimmy Zaporteza, former chairman of the
multisectoral Buklod Pagbilao which opposes the plant, noted only Mayor
Conrado de Rama represented the municipal government in the monitoring
group. Mr. Zaporteza also scored the group's lack of transparency in
conducting its meetings.

Bear Stearns urges gov"t to issue new money bonds

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Maricris C. Carlos

Anticipating continued strength in investors' appetite for the
country's new uncollateralized bonds, a global investment bank has
urged government to invest in New Money Bonds (NMB), said to be
higher-yielding than local bonds.

In a recently released paper, New York-based Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc.
said it foresees yield from the Philippines' Brady bond swap to be at
par with the Eurobonds issued by the National Power Corp. (Napocor).

"Assuming the Philippines succeeds in completing its bond exchange,
there should be a convergence between yields on the remaining Brady
bonds and the (existing) sovereign-rated euro issues," Bear Stearns
said.

Earlier, Napocor issued about $100-million Eurobonds to bankroll its
infrastructure projects. The bonds were guaranteed by the National
Government.

Eurobonds are corporate or government-denominated bonds sold in a
currency other than the national currency of the issuer.

The US investment bank said investors should be offered to buy NMBs
which is seen to have a higher cash flow yield than Napocor at 9% in
2002. On the other hand, it admitted NMBs have "shorter average life."

An NMB is a type of debt instrument issued by government in the 80s to
generate additional funding for government projects.

Early this month, government announced it will retire $1.9 billion of
its Brady bonds by swapping them with new debt.

Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said government plans to issue
at least $200 million of 20-year fixed-rate and $200 million of 15-year
floating-rate bonds.

The Philippines has set a 7% US Treasury benchmark rate to be used in
determining the price and yields of the bond swaps, arranger J.P.
Morgan yesterday said.

The rate gives the 2017 bond exchange a yield of 8.3% on a price of
$823.43 per $1,000 of principal. The 2018 exchange bond yield is also
8.3% on a price of $827.18 per $1,000 principal amount. The minimum
fixed rate bond exchange yield is 9.25%.

The bond swap was developed based on a model set by Mexico, the first
to use the so-called Brady plan to restructure defaulted commercial
debt in 1989. Mexico was also the first to swap Bradys for new bonds.

The scheme removes US Treasuries as collateral and allows yield-hungry
investors to obtain straight exposure to the economy and their
high-yielding assets.

International credit rating agencies Duff & Phelps and Standard &
Poor's have assigned a "BB" rating to the bonds, to be issued in
exchange for the Brady Par Bonds, Series A and B.

Government is offering 15-year floating rate bonds and 20-year fixed
rate bonds, with interest yields to be fixed on September 18. With the
move, it also hopes to reduce by 17% the country's outstanding debt
stock. - with report from Reuter

Gov"t to rely more on foreign loans

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

So as not to crowd out the private sector, the government is leaning
more on foreign borrowings rather than domestic loans.

Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr. yesterday said the move is meant
to give the private sector increased access to domestic credit and, in
the process, lower interest rates.

He said the change is a "desirable" action since the government will
not crowd out private firms tapping domestic funds.

With the government's limited presence in the domestic loan market,
interest rates are expected to go down which will allow more private
corporations to access additional funds for expansion.

Data submitted by the Department of Budget and Management show the
government in the last three years had been dependent on domestic
borrowings.

In 1994, it borrowed P668 billion from local sources. This increased to
P724 billion in 1995 and P777 billion in 1996. Projected domestic debt
for 1997 is P820 billion.

Foreign debt in 1994 was P397 billion, but dipped to P390 billion in
1995 and P377 billion in 1996. It is expected to further decrease to
P368 billion next year.

Budget assistant secretary Narcisa Santos told a Senate budget hearing
the government intends to bridge the gap between the growth of foreign
loans and domestic borrowings.

"Local borrowings (by the government) really crowd out the private
sector for available credit," she said.

Mr. Enriquez said foreign borrowings would be more beneficial to the
country since these have lower interest rates.

Next year, interest payment on the total foreign loans is pegged at
P74.2 billion while principal amortization is placed at P43.5 billion.

Total borrowings for 1997 are placed at P1.18 trillion composed of P820
billion of domestic loans and P377 billion of foreign borrowings.

Mr. Enriquez said the country will have to continue its dependence on
borrowings despite the existence of the build-operate-transfer (BOT)
scheme meant to increase private sector participation in economic
building.

He said the BOT "can only go so far" and could not be solely relied on
by the government. "We need to unify everything, borrowings, savings
and BOT."

He added there's no need to worry about the balance of payments since
the government has a "good standing" with almost P5 billion.

He pointed out the public and legislators need not worry about the
government's possible abuse of getting loans since there is a law which
limits foreign borrowings to $10 billion at any given time.

The peso strengthened 1.2 centavos, averaging P26.232 to $1 from
P26.244. "The dollar demand from foreign fund managers has simmered
down," said a trader, noting the same demand had caused the peso's
uptrend. Volume rose to $190.2 million. "Trading was very active, there
was a lot of selling," said the trader. He added the Bangko Sentral

Public sector surplus hits P14 billion in first half

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

Improved revenue performance enabled the government to realize a
surplus of P14.1 billion in its consolidated public sector financial
position (CPSFP) in the first half of 1996, data from the Department of
Finance (DoF) show.

A year ago, a surplus of P4.1 billion was recorded.

The consolidated public sector balance represents the fiscal position
of the National Government, including its agencies and
"instrumentalities."

The DoF cited increased tax collection as well as improved performance
by other monitored public sector entities - the Social Security System
(SSS), the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Bangko
Sentral, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCC), and
government financial institutions (GFI).

According to the DoF, a major factor is the P9.7-billion fiscal surplus
enjoyed by the National Government during the period.

The bulk of the surplus came from the Bureau of Customs, which exceeded
its programmed collection by P3 billion.

Improved net cash flows amounting to P8.3 billion from the SSS and the
GSIS also contributed, as well as the net income of the Bangko Sentral
of P5.5 billion.

The net income of GFIs amounting to some P2.7 billion as well as the
lower-than-programmed deficit incurred by monitored GOCCs helped.

The DoF expected GOCCs to incur a deficit of P10.96 billion but the
actual figure registered was just P9.15 billion.

Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said "the surplus generated by
the consolidated public sector has helped dampen inflation and interest
rates."

From 11.8% in March, inflation dropped to 7.9% in August. The
bell-weather 91-day Treasury bill rate also declined from 13.2% last
May to 11.3% in yesterday's auction.

"These developments will help boost the country's growth performance to
the higher range of 7% to 7.5% during the year," he added.

Although the Finance chief sees "an acceleration of infrastructure
spending" during the rest of the year, he said this is not expected to
erode the surplus.

The government is eyeing a zero CPSD for next year.

Huge CPSD had handicapped the Philippine economy for almost two decades
due to the dismal performance of GOCCs and GFIs, which in the past have
transferred liabilities to the National Government.

Earlier, Mr. de Ocampo warned the country faces a P14-billion deficit
in its CPSFP next year if Congress fails to pass the controversial
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP).

He said there's that danger considering no firm alternatives have been
identified on where the government should source the P13.6 billion it
expects to forgo without the CTRP.

Malacanang to "force" version of "sin" taxes

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

By Ronald F. Jabal, Paul N. Villegas and Jemileen U. Nuqui

Malacanang will force its hand and play hard ball when the proposed
excise taxes on "sin" products reach the bicameral conference
committee. And, eventually, it will win.

A high-ranking leader of the House of Representatives, who requested
not to be named, told BusinessWorld Malacanang is not willing to settle
for anything less than what was agreed on in a recent
Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC).

In his weekly press conference yesterday, President Ramos expressed
optimism the Senate will fine-tune Malacanang's version of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP) when it starts to tackle the
excise portion passed last week by the House of Representatives.

Mr. Ramos said he is banking on the Senate to come up with a better
version of the excise tax system.

"The Senate still has to put out its own version... They (Senate)
cannot go ahead of the House when it comes to tax or revenue
appropriation measures. But now that they have it, then they can go on
putting their own revisions," Mr. Ramos said.

The Ramos government is pushing for a specific tax scheme for "sin
products" under the excise tax portion of the CTRP, which is expected
to generate an annual revenue collection of P13 billion. The Budget
department has incorporated this projected figure in its 1997 budget.

Should the Senate pass a version different from that of Malacanang, Mr.
Ramos said he will remind both Chambers of their promise to harmonize
their versions during the bicameral conference committee.

Malacanang is counting on the promises made by Senate ways and means
committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile and finance committee chief
Ernesto Maceda to pass the version that will generate the most revenues.

LEDAC members earlier agreed to support an outright shift to specific
tax from the present ad valorem tax on both beer and cigarettes.
However, the Lower House "selectively" followed the agreement. It
approved a shift to specific tax on beer products while it approved a
"de facto" ad valorem tax on cigarettes.

This alarmed the Palace, the source said. If the Senate does not
deliver, the Executive is left with no recourse but to "force its hand"
in the bicameral conference committee, the House source said. "It will
strongly lobby for the passage of a specific tax on all sin products...
Eventually, the President's word will prevail," he said.

The source referred to a letter of Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo
to the House leadership dated May 29, a copy of which was obtained by
BusinessWorld, to bolster his claims. He said Mr. de Ocampo asked the
House Majority Leader, Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano, to help in the
passage of a version as close as possible to the Finance department's
proposal and a formula "that the President can accept."

The DoF-backed formula calls for a specific tax as the basis for
computing and assessing tax liability. However, a quarterly computation
of tax liability on an ad valorem basis by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue via market sampling at the retail level will also be
undertaken. Should the ad valorem computation result in a higher tax
take for the government, the difference would be treated as an
additional tax liability.

The source quoted the Finance official as saying, "We must endeavor to
pass a version that adheres as closely as possible to the main elements
of the (DoF formula) and that the President can accept," he said.

"This only means Malacanang will not accept anything that does not
conform with its formula...We can expect then a 'seen' hand in the
(bicameral conference committee discussions)," the source said.

This has always been the fear of Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo who said
whatever legislation Congress approves is always mangled in the
bicameral conference committee. "It (bicameral conference committee)
has become a modern-day Frankenstein," he said. However, he is hoping
House committee on ways and means chairman Antique Rep. Exequiel Javier
does not renege on his commitment not to allow anybody to mangle the
House version.

This developed as House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. yesterday
instructed the ways and means committee to fast-track the consideration
of the last component of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package - the
income tax reforms and the tax administration reforms.

He sought the immediate passage of the tax measure increasing the
exemption of wage earners and exempting families living below the
poverty line and overseas contract workers from paying income tax.

The CTRP calls for an increase of exemption to a uniform P20,000 from
the present P9,000 for single individuals, P12,000 for heads of the
family and P18,000 for married individuals.

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader San Juan Rep. Ronaldo Zamora yesterday
pushed for an increased income tax exemptions for separated women and
single parents. He, however, failed to state up to what level the
increase in exemptions should be. At present, single parents can claim
only a P12,000 deduction as head of the family. He also called for the
exemption of the first P150,000 annual income of couples with four
dependents.

In a related development, the approval of the proposed P476.2-billion
national budget for next year will not be delayed even if the CTRP is
not in place, said Senate Majority Leader Alberto Romulo.

He said Congress can deliberate on the budget and the CTRP at the same
time since the two measures "go together."

Sen. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, economic affairs committee chairman,
added Congress can approve the budget based on projected revenues.

She told BusinessWorld legislators do not expect any delay in the
passage of the 1997 budget because Congress or the Executive can
exercise the authority to cut expenditures.

Mr. Romulo said both Houses have enough time to approve the CTRP and
the budget as long as solons have political will.

"Since the budget relies on revenues, the two proposals go together and
will be passed on time," he added.

FOCUS: Computerized elections: Room for improvement

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

By Veronica C. Silva

First of two parts

All eyes were focused on the elections in the Autonomous Region for
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) last Sept. 9. Though the region represents less
than 3% of the country's total voting population, the elections were of
national importance.

Some say for newly proclaimed governor Nur Misuari, who ran
unchallenged, last week's elections were a baptism of fire: a test of
whether or not the Moro National Liberation Front's covenant with the
government heralds the coming of peace in the region. If the reports of
election-related violence were used as a measuring stick, he would pass
with flying colors. Both the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the
National Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) reported "minor"
incidents of such violence, even describing the ARMM elections as
"boring" and "dull."

Equally significant is that the computerized election system the
government is planning for the national polls in 1988 was pilot-tested
in ARMM. Republic Act No. 8046, enacted in June 1995, authorized the
pilot testing of the system which will facilitate the holding of clean,
honest and orderly elections.

Almost all those who closely monitored the ARMM elections agree the
pilot test was successful in terms of speeding up the counting and
canvassing of votes. Mr. Misuari and his running mate, Guimid Matalam,
were proclaimed winners after 48 hours. But, then again, they needed
only one vote each to win since there were no other candidates.

There is still room for improvement, said Rizal Rep. Emigdio S.
Tanjuatco, Jr., chairman of the House of Representatives committee on
suffrage and electoral reforms, and a member of the pilot-test
oversight committee.

"The automated counting system, which minimized almost to nil human
intervention and then speeded up the counting, really addresses the
problem of dagdag-bawas - the manipulation or falsification of election
returns and statement of votes," he told BusinessWorld. "However, the
functioning of the (counting) machine can stand some improvements." He
also sees the need to streamline procedures.

Some of the problems observed during the pilot test, such as wet
ballots, were not technology-related but nonetheless affected the
performance of the machines.

Much is expected from the computerization of elections, but many agree
the electoral system needs more than a technological face-lift. While
technology helps automate some steps, relying on it to solve
election-related problems is only accomplishing half the task.

The project to computerize elections has had its share of criticisms.
Issues such as the high cost involved, voters' attitude and security
risks were raised.

When RA 8046 was enacted last year, the next task was to look for the
appropriate technology to do the job.

During the tenure of Comelec chairman Christian Monsod, consultants
from the information technology (IT) industry, local and foreign, were
tapped to evaluate the available technology.

But when current chairman Bernardo P. Pardo took over, the Comelec did
the evaluation itself. Executive director Resurreccion Z. Borra said
the poll body even insisted on its independence from the National
Computer Center, an agency under the Office of the President.

For its purposes, Comelec chose the American Information Systems, Inc.
(AIS) counting machine which uses an optical scanning device to "read"
the ballots fed from a paper tray.

Comelec acquired 40 units of the AIS Model 150 which can read 150
ballots per minute.

The machine eliminates problems related to erroneous entries in vote
tallying since little human intervention is involved, said Alwin S.
Sta. Rosa, Comelec director for Management Information Systems.

In the ARMM elections, one counting machine was provided for every two
municipalities. Only authorized personnel were allowed to operate it.
It recorded the number of votes counted in a 3.5" diskette. A printer
produced a hard copy and this document was used by the Namfrel in
conducting an unofficial tally of the votes through its Akbay Bilang
Center.

The Comelec used a personal computer (PC) to consolidate municipal
results and produce the provincial count. A computer program developed
by AIS - Election Reporting System (ERS) - was used to consolidate the
votes. A hard copy of the results was also produced.

One of the major issues raised about the computerization of elections
was security.

Namfrel's earlier concern was the use of the 3.5" diskette, fearing
that since this diskette is commercially available, it is easy to
switch diskettes and tamper with the data.

RA 8046 specifies the use of "memory packs," in this case, a diskette,
to store data or the election tally.

Comelec officials assured security measures were put in place to
guarantee the sanctity of the ballot.

Mr. Sta. Rosa said each diskette was pre-coded and encrypted to ensure
no switching would go undetected by the system. Should the PC user
insert a diskette whose code could not be read, the computer program
will reject it. Should diskette switching take place, the results will
be invalidated.

Should this happen, whether or not special elections would be allowed
is not yet clear.

Comelec officials said the computer printouts provide the audit trails
for the new system. Officials said should there be a discrepancy
between the diskette and the printout, the latter will be used as the
official document.

In an interview before the ARMM elections, Mr. Borra told BusinessWorld
Comelec personnel anticipated bad weather and the lack of
transportation as potential problems. Some areas in Marawi City and
Tawi-Tawi, for example, are 18 to 20 hours away from the provincial
capital where the counting machines are located. He said these could
delay the centralized counting of the votes.

Mr. Borra also then said some ballots to be transported across the seas
have to be carefully handled because if these get wet, the counting
machine would not be able to read them. Mr. Sta. Rosa, on the other
hand, assured the Comelec staff were prepared for possible technical
problems, saying technicians were trained to do troubleshooting on
site. He added that should one counting machine bogs down, there were
backup machines.

More than one counting machine and PC were located in a provincial
counting center where the votes were to be consolidated. Lanao, the
largest voting province in the region, had the most number of machines
at 19, Mr. Sta. Rosa said.

No matter how prepared the Comelec and its deputies were, the ARMM
pilot project was beset by problems, many of which were not
technology-related.

With the new technology, the Comelec projected the voter turnout at the
ARMM elections at between 80% and 85%. Mr. Borra said the commission
was hoping the voters would go out and vote, the new system
guaranteeing the security of their ballots. However, over a week has
passed and the Comelec still has to announce the official voter
turnout. Mr. Borra said the earliest the Comelec can announce the
official number is tomorrow.

Counting in some areas has been quite slow because of moist ballots
which could not be fed to the counting machine.

Mr. Tanjuatco observed humidity caused the ballots to stick together,
causing frequent paper jams.

"If this happens often, then your rate per minute will go down instead
of attaining 150 ballots per minute," the solon said.

Moisture from heavy rains and turbulent seas seeped into the windows of
the ballot boxes, noted Mr. Borra. Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao
experienced heavy rains on election day and the first day of counting.
The ballots had to be dried first before these could be fed to the
machines.

Mr. Borra said the Comelec had wrapped the ballots with cellophane or
plastic before distribution to polling centers but they still got wet.
For the next elections, he suggested windowless ballot boxes or other
protective covering to better protect the ballots.

Another problem noted was the long queues both at the polling centers
and the reception areas for the ballot boxes. For this, Namfrel
chairman Jose S. Concepcion, Jr. blamed "controls in the bureaucracy."

He said some election officials did not know Namfrel volunteers were to
be given copies of the printout for the group's quick count. Some
election officials insisted on the bureaucratic procedure: some asked
their supervisors for permission while others insisted they compile the
printout before giving Namfrel the copies. He said this defeated the
whole purpose of conducting a quick count.

Mr. Concepcion also mentioned an election official putting all copies
of the printout inside the ballot box. Under RA 8046, the copies of the
printout should be distributed to the majority and minority parties and
the election officer. Only one copy of the printout and the diskette go
into the ballot box.

Members of the Board of Election Inspectors were required to sign the
printout. However, Mr. Concepcion noticed the signatures were mere
formalities because the teachers who were supposed to witness the
functioning of the machine do not appear to be computer literate. They
did not know whether there were any errors in the procedures.

Mr. Concepcion also related that when the counting machine bogged down,
one of the board of election inspectors, a teacher who was assigned to
the machine, cannot or maybe has forgotten how to operate it. This
confusion contributed to the long lines outside the counting centers,
he said.

Technical problems compounded by bad weather delayed the regional
canvass of the ARMM elections.

The regional board of canvassers, headed by Mr. Borra, convened at the
Comelec office in Manila on Sept. 10, but no certificates of canvass
and diskettes arrived until early the following day. Mr. Borra,
however, expected this, saying the board was supposed to consolidate
the results as soon as the diskettes arrived.

Mr. Borra said these problems were anticipated and did not affect the
schedule of the counting and proclamation. He said Messrs. Misuari and
Matalam were proclaimed governor and vice-governor of ARMM on Sept. 11,
still within the 48-hour schedule the poll body has set. The 21
assemblymen for the seven districts of ARMM were all proclaimed two
days after.

Without the computerized system, observers said it could have taken
more than a week to complete the canvass of votes for a region with
close to a million registered voters like ARMM.

FVR denies involvement in Charter changes plan

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

President Ramos is keeping his distance from recent moves in the House
of Representatives to amend the Constitution to allow him to extend his
term beyond 1998.

During his weekly press conference yesterday, Mr. Ramos denied changing
his mind on the matter.

"My position is that my time, the time of the people, the time of
Congress, the time of all responsible Filipinos should be devoted to
getting our legislative program finished so that we shall have a
sustainable economic development," he said.

The Chief Executive said recent moves in the Lower House to change the
Constitution is not the sole domain of lawmakers belonging to the
administration party Lakas-NUCD. He noted a Nacionalista Party
congressman from Iloilo is one of the main proponents of Charter
changes.

"If some Lakas are involved there, they are just supporting or
responding or reacting to earlier initiatives by some members of
Congress," Mr. Ramos said.

The President has repeatedly said he will not seek reelection when his
term expires in 1998.

But he dismissed the possibility that Lakas will institute disciplinary
actions against partymates who continue to initiate moves in amending
the Charter.

"These are not criminally punishable acts on the part of the party
members," he said.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday said the House
leadership does not support plans to amend the 1987 Constitution.

"It has been put in the back burner and it will remain there," said Mr.
de Venecia in a statement.

But Lakas-NUCD party whip for Mindanao and Bukidon Rep. Jose Zubiri
confirmed that several congressmen are soliciting public support for
the plan to amend the Constitution.

Meanwhile, Malabon-Navotas Rep. Tessie Aquino Oreta challenged her
colleagues and President Ramos to enter into a written "covenant" with
the people that they will all step down in 1998.

"If the President cannot accept the challenge of showing sincerity on
his pronouncements that he will give up Malacanang in 1998, we, in the
Lower House, should show the way that Malacanang may follow our
example," she said.

Gov"t consultants get P700,000 monthly

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Senators were asked yesterday to check on the reported hiring of
foreign consultants at very high salaries by several government
agencies. Senator Juan Flavier yesterday said it is necessary to look
into the situation since the fees, which range between P300,000 and
P700,000 per month for every consultant, appears questionable. "We may
not have all the expertise for government programs but I find it hard
to accept that they (foreign consultants) are being paid so much," he
said. Data from the office of the senator showed a foreign consultant
in the Health department received as much as P700,000 per month
excluding per diems and travel allowances. A consultant of the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), meanwhile,
receives a monthly salary of P390,000. In another DENR project, 116
foreign consultants were hired on "call basis" with salaries ranging
from P2,000 to P9,000 a day. A project to rehabilitate Pasig River
allotted P30 million for the salaries of six consultants or P5 million
per consultant for the entire program. Mr. Flavier said the practice of
hiring foreign consultants has to be regulated because it could lead to
abuse and misspending. "We need a clear government policy on this
matter." He disclosed the agencies should not hire consultants left and
right since the money, usually loans, utilized for projects has to be
repaid by the government.

Dept of Health warns hospitals on wastes

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Government and private hospitals are in for a rough time once the
health department finds out which ones are not complying with proper
waste management disposal practices. Health Secretary Carmencita
Reodica yesterday issued a stern warning to erring hospital
administrations that their service licenses will be revoked should they
fail to meet the minimum requirements set for sanitation facilities. In
a briefing with reporters, Ms. Reodica stressed the importance of a
hospital incinerator as part of the overall health program of the
country. However, due to the high cost of purchasing an incinerator,
the lady chief said hospitals should instead encourage a waste
management disposal networking scheme wherein groups of hospitals may
avail of the services of a common contractor. An incinerator costs
about P4 million. Based on a 1994-1995 report of the Environmental
Health Services of the Department of Health (DoH), majority of the 45
government hospitals failed to meet the requirements for sanitation
facilities. It likewise revealed that hospital personnel practices on
hospital waste management is "far from ideal." Of the 45 hospitals,
only six have their own incinerators: National Kidney Institute, San
Lazaro Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Center for Mental
Health, Vicente Sotto Hospital in Davao and Cullon Hospital in Palawan.
Private hospitals with incinerators are East Avenue Medical Center,
Rizal Medical Center, Orthopedic Hospital and Jose Fabella Memorial
Hospital.

Charge corrupt prosecutors, public urged

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. yesterday urged the public to
file formal complaints against corrupt prosecutors. This is after the
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) promised to submit a
list of corrupt prosecutors to the justice department yesterday. Mr.
Guingona also asked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to look
into reports that "fix-cals" abound, particularly in the provinces.
Meanwhile, DILG Secretary Robert Barbers yesterday asked Mr. Guingona
to take action against two prosecutors who allegedly mishandled two
cases. Mr. Barbers said Quezon City assistant prosecutor Hilda
Fantastico-Ibuyan issued "a highly irregular and contradictory
resolution" in the extortion case against a policeman. Also irregular
was the dismissal by Pasig City prosecutor Eduardo R. Garcia of the
case against a suspected drug dealer operating in the Taguig, he said.
But Mr. Guingona said the DILG should first submit evidence against
prosecutors Ibuyan and Garcia before he can order an investigation.
Meanwhile, Mr. Barbers also requested Chief Presidential Legal Counsel
Renato Cayetano to ask the Supreme Court to review the life
imprisonment penalty imposed by a Manila court Monday on Malaysian drug
trafficker Allan Khor Monday. The DILG chief said the convict should
have been sentenced to death. Also yesterday, he directed Police Chief
Supt. Reynaldo Wycoco to check on the issuance of a firearm to Khor by
the Police Firearms and Explosives Division (FED). The convict is an
illegal alien, thus he cannot be granted a license to own and carry a
firearm, said Mr. Barbers.

Guingona warns Barbers on identification system

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona, Jr. yesterday warned Interior and
Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers from imposing a barangay
identification system. This, he said, violates basic human rights. "It
must be free from compulsion. Otherwise, it may violate the people's
rights," he said, adding that it is best carried out voluntarily.

US thanks RP for terrorists arrest

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Washington has expressed its appreciation to the Ramos government's
contribution to the conviction in New York in September 5 of terrorists
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad, and Wali Khan Amin Shah. In a
letter to President Ramos, US ambassador to the Philippines Thomas
Hubbard congratulated Philippine law enforcement agencies for their
close cooperation which led to the expeditious resolution of the
criminal cases filed against the three terrorists in New York. Mr.
Yousef and his two companions were found guilty by a US court for
plotting to bomb American airlines. The other convicted terrorists were
arrested by law enforcers in Manila in January 1995 while Yousef fled
to Pakistan where he was later arrested. "We look forward to continuing
this cooperation," Mr. Hubbard wrote in his letter.

Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority gets more time to review port bids

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

President Ramos yesterday approved the request of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) for more time to revaluate bids submitted
by three port container firms for the development and operation of the
container terminal at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. The SBMA was
supposed to have come out with its decision on the winning bidder
yesterday. It sued for more time given difficulties in evaluating bids.
The SBMA was earlier ordered to reevaluate the bids of International
Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI), Hutchison Ports Philippines,
Inc. and Royal Ports Services, Inc. after ICTSI questioned the award of
the contract to Hutchison despite having made the highest bid.

Gov"t not to blame for dike breach - DPWH

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar yesterday said government
engineers who designed the P1.4-billion Pampanga megadike should not be
blamed for breaches in the structure. He instead pointed to private
contractor Altantic Erectors, Inc. which he accused of failing to
follow government specifications of the engineers while building the
structure. "There must be proof that the design is wrong. We don't feel
these people (in DPWH) have to be convicted," said Mr. Vigilar in a
Senate hearing. The megadike was designed the Bureau of Designs of the
Department of Public Works and Highways. He said the DPWH would admit
responsibility for faulty design only if specifications were met and
the dike still collapsed.

Police bikes for APEC security defective

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Police officials allegedly purchased 30 defective Kawasaki 750 cc
motorcycles for security escorts during the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in November, said a source at the Traffic
Management Command (TMC) yesterday. Motorcycle policemen are
complaining of defective clutches, oil leaks, loose screws, loose
blinkers and weak sirens, the source said. Also, the motorcycles are
only for hobbyists and are not suited for patrolling streets. "It looks
like the manufacturer just added police accessories to the P225,000
bike," the source said. The police spent in June an estimated P6.8
million for the bikes, including helmets which did not pass police
specifications.

Nothing final on gov"t-Moro Islamic Liberation Front talks

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

There is nothing final with the planned peace negotiations between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), said President
Ramos during his weekly press conference yesterday.

Also, a ceasefire agreement between the two is not expected to be
signed today.

Mr. Ramos said negotiations with the MILF, a splinter group of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), are being coursed through back
channels since the government has yet to map out formal talks.

"What we are doing now is preliminary talks through the back channel,
nothing official. But I can assure you that there is a lot of friendly
back channeling efforts being done by peace advocates as well as local
officials," he said.

The Chief Executive also said the government's peace strategy with the
MILF is similar with its strategy with the MNLF.

"Of course, we hope that one with the MILF will not last that many
months or years. After all, we have started already with the MNLF. The
difference, however, between formal talks or negotiating talks must be
made," Mr. Ramos said.

The MILF has been critical against the government's peace accord with
the MNLF, particularly on the creation of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), which will oversee peace and
development projects in 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.

It may be noted the MILF wants complete autonomy for Mindanao.

Mr. Ramos also said he has issued a memorandum on the creation of a
special task force to oversee peace negotiations with the MILF and
other enemies of the state.

Meanwhile, MNLF officials yesterday asked the Senate to conduct an
investigation into the alleged involvement of four politicians and
former military men with Christian vigilante groups in Mindanao.

This is after the MNLF accused businessmen and politicians with
business interests in Mindanao of spearheading moves against the
establishment of the SPCPD.

In a forum at Club Filipino in Greenhills, MNLF legal counsel Blo
Adiong claimed these businessmen and politicians also floated a "white
paper" which said the SPCPD will "Islamize" Mindanao.

The white paper was reportedly circulated in Zamboanga and Cotabato.

Mr. Adiong claims these politicians and businessmen "are the same
personalities that have big business in Mindanao."

Earlier, South Cotabato Rep. Daisy Avance-Fuentes, Department of
Interior and Local Government undersecretary Alvin Dans, Sultan Kudarat
Mayor Gonzalo de Pedro and former South Cotabato mayor Eddie Juanche
were named in a military report as supporters of militia groups in
Mindanao.

But Ms. Avance-Fuentes and Mr. Dans denied the allegation. Military
officials also said the report was unconfirmed.

Military and police operatives, meanwhile, are now looking into the
alleged involvement of a prominent businessmen in Zamboanga City with
the Mindanao Christian Unified Command (MCUC).

Meanwhile, former MNLF spokesman Datu Ibrahim Uy Alhadj, now chairman
of the Bangsa Moro Holdings Inc., also said Christian militia groups
are harmless compared with the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf.

"They (militia groups) are not capable of creating violent attacks and
take arms against the government and other Muslims," he said.

Meanwhile, MNLF chairman and new Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM) governor Nur Misuari is expected to join negotiations with the
MNLF.

Presidential Management Staff chief Alexander Aguirre yesterday said
the MNLF will be consulted the MILF peace talks since a large
concentration of Islamic Front is in the ARMM.

Earlier, Mr. Misuari reportedly planned to distance himself from the
proposed talks, saying that is "solely the initiative of the
government."

Meanwhile, senators yesterday vowed to block the proposed P230-million
budget for the integration of MNLF members into the Philippine National
Police (PNP) unless the government can provide a clear program for
rebel disarmament.

Senate Minority Leader Edgardo Angara said the lack of a disarmament
plan for MNLF forces, particularly those excluded from the integration
scheme, is a source of apprehension among people in Mindanao.

Death penalty legal

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Although it is not necessary to pass upon the constitutionality of the
death penalty, the Supreme Court should pass judgment on the
correctness of death sentences imposed by trial courts.

Thus recommended Jesuit priest and lawyer Joaquin Bernas,
vice-president of the 1987 Constitutional Commission, in a 23-page
memorandum submitted yesterday to the High Court.

He also asked the High Tribunal to formulate guidelines for trial
courts to follow in imposing death sentences.

The Supreme Court had asked Fr. Bernas to give his recommendations
after death row convict Pedro Malabago questioned the constitutionality
of the heinous crimes law. A lower court had sentenced Malabago to
death after it found him guilty of killing his wife.

Fr. Bernas said Congress did not violate the Constitution when it
enacted Republic Act 7659 which paved the way for the reimposition of
the death penalty by classifying several crimes as heinous. But it is
the duty of courts to examine the validity of the classification.

"The fact that Congress has listed a crime in the books as heinous does
not settle everything. Congressional definitions are not always
conclusive. It is the same when Congress labels a crime as heinous.
Crimes do not exist in books. Crime exist in life. And life is not
univocal," said Fr. Bernas.

He also said Congress did not impose the death penalty but merely
provides for a penalty which the courts, where proper, may impose.

"It is the courts which decide whether it is legally and
constitutionally proper to impose the penalty, and impose it not on an
abstract criminal coldly described in books but on warm bodied accused
individuals who possess the very fundamental and precious right to
life," he said.

Political advertising ban on showbiz folk proposed

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Media and showbiz personalities planning to run for office should take
a "leave of absence" to avoid the possible "misuse of media" by
candidates, says House Bill 7462 which will amend the law banning
political advertisements.

The bill seeks to amend the Omnibus Election Code by allowing the use
of mass media and other campaign materials by candidates running for
office.

"The bill seeks to equalize the political playing field by reducing the
undue advantage enjoyed by candidates who are media or show business
personalities ," said Rizal Rep. Emigdio Tanjuatco, Jr. in a
sponsorship speech recently.

He includes in the ban media and showbusiness personalities who are
campaigning for candidates. Mr. Tanjuatco also suggests that their
films, commercials and endorsements be banned.

This is to "level the playing field and rationalize media use," he said.

Dept of Transportation and Communication seeks more penalties for cellphone
cloning

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Transport and communication officials yesterday recommended stiffer
penalties against cloning and the illegal use of frequencies.

The Department of Transportation and Communication (DoTC) as well as
the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) proposed higher fines
and longer imprisonment under the telecommunications anti-fraud bill
pending in Congress.

DoTC and NTC said the penalties for cloning should include a minimum
fine of P1 million as well as imprisonment for not less than 12 years.

Under House Bill 2430, cloning and the illegal use of frequencies are
punishable with six to eight years imprisonment or a fine of not less
than P200,000.

Transportation and Communications undersecretary Josefina T. Lichauco,
in a letter to Senator Sergio Osmena, III, chairman of the committee on
public services, said the proposed stiffer penalties were reached in
consultation with the private sector.

The Senate versions of HB 2430 are Senate Bills 1386 and 1505.

Under existing laws, cloning, subscription fraud, and other similarly
illegal acts are not considered criminal offenses.

The bills also cover illegal connections such as unreported extension
telephone lines, third number billing fraud (where a caller charges a
long distance call to a telephone number without the consent of the
owner), and destruction of telecommunication facilities like public
telephone booths.

Economic Indicator: Per capita GNP improves by 5%

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10

By Rene A. Mallari

With the economy's 7.1% growth in the first semester, real per capita
income correspondingly improved.

Data culled from the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB)
show per capita gross national product (GNP) - or the estimated income
each Filipino receives - at constant 1985 prices was placed at P5,916
in the first half of the year. This registered a 4.6% hike from P5,655
in the same period last year. A rising income means Filipinos are
better off than before.

Real per capita GNP is calculated by dividing GNP by the population
during a given period. Ideally, the output produced by the economy
should be faster than population growth. For the past two years, the
economy has been growing more than twice the population growth. In
particular, GNP expanded 5.5% in 1995 and 7.1% in the first half of
1996. Based on the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, the number of
Filipinos was estimated at 71.9 million as of the second quarter of
1996, increasing steadily by roughly 2.3% annually. Per Capita GDP

Per capita gross domestic product (GDP), on the other hand, amounted to
P5,641, up 2.6% from P5,496 the previous period. This was slightly
better than the 2.3% growth posted in 1995. Per capita GDP is deemed
more reliable measure of one's income level than per capita GNP.

The growth in per capita GDP can be traced mainly to the favorable
performance of the agricultural sector which registered a 3.8% upswing
in the first six months, or a rebound from almost 1% in the preceding
year. The NSCB reported that strong production of palay, corn and
sugarcane kept the sector moving.

However, the gap between per capita GNP and GDP during the period under
review has widened. In 1996, the difference was at P275, bigger than
P159 in 1995 and P134 in 1994. In recent years, net factor income from
abroad (NFIA) which includes remittances of overseas contract workers
(OCWs) remained a major contributor to GNP. OCW remittances have been
on an uptrend, accelerating 76.5% in the first semester.

Despite the widening gap, economists are confident per capita GDP will
soon catch up since investments have been leading local growth.

As real per capita GNP improved, purchasing power further expanded.
Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) per head was valued at P4,337,
up 2% from P4,251 the previous year. PCE refers to consumer spending
for goods and services.

PCE for the past quarters has generally slowed down. This can mean more
Filipinos have been saving or pouring their surplus funds to longer
termed investments.

Economic Indicator: Increasing number of contractors shows upbeat
construction sector

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10

By Leotes Marie T. Lugo

Reflective of the upsurge of construction activity in the country, more
and more contractors have been granted licenses by the Philippine
Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB). In a span of five years,
population of the local contracting sector reached 8,225 or nearly
double the 5,476 registered in 1991.

Contractors are primarily responsible for gathering all the necessary
resources required in putting up the desired facility. Proponents of
the contracting sector also coordinate and supervise the entire
construction process. An increase in the number of contractors attest
to impressive showing of the industry.

PCAB is the government agency tasked to issue, limit, suspend and
revoke contractors' licenses as well as upgrade the classification of
licensed contractors. The Board issues regular and special licenses.
The first is granted to Filipino sole proprietorships, and partnerships
or corporations with at least 60% equity participation. The latter is
issued to joint ventures, consortiums, foreign constructors or a
project owner engaged in the construction of a single specific
undertaking.

Increasing disposable incomes, lower interest rates and favorable
demographics contributed to the boom in both residential and
nonresidential construction. Rising demand for support facilities in
stride with the country's economic expansion also enticed more
companies to join the real estate bandwagon.

In the first quarter alone, the sector was joined by 1,973 new approved
contractors. More than half of the total fell under category D.
Contractors are categorized with respect to their minimum capital base.
Firms under AAA have a minimum capital of P10 million; AA, P5 million;
A, P1 million; B, P500,000; C, P300,000; D, P100,000 and Trade, P5,000.

A closer look at the PCAB data show the industry is composed mainly of
small contractors. Firms under category D, C and B captured the first,
second and third places respectively, in terms of number. Even
aggregate entities under the Trade classification exceeded the combined
total of type AAA and AA contractors. Trade contractors are limited to
repair works and undertakings of up to P500,000 contract or project
cost.

Moreover, only 199 companies fell under the AAA grouping. These are the
companies capable of handling large scale projects worth P50 million
and above. Commonly referred to as the big guns in the industry, these
include D.M. Consunji Inc., EEI Corp. and F.F. Cruz and Company, Inc.,
among others.

The present composition though may prove a disadvantage to the
industry. Faced with the entry of foreign players, "local contractors
must join forces and be ready for competition," a high ranking
Philippine Constructors Association (PCA) official said.

The official further noted that joint ventures are fast becoming a
practice in the sector, which PCA hopes will lead to the formation of
consortiums and in the long run, mergers among construction companies.

Approvals of licenses is expected to be on the uptick given the
consistent positive showing of the industry, Sonia T. Valdeavilla,
Philippine Overseas Construction Board-International Projects
Monitoring Division chief told BusinessWorld in an earlier interview.

Ms. Valdeavilla pointed to the increasing government budget for
infrastructure as well as the Countryside Development Fund as
additional come-ons for construction firms. Build-operate-transfer
projects in the pipeline are estimated to cost P212.53 billion.
Likewise, the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP)
estimates real construction output to move up 13.5% this year and
accelerate at an annual average rate of 14% until 1998. Tourism and
real estate development are also counted on to bolster the industry's
growth.

CIAP computed real demand for construction this year to reach P99.2
billion, of which P55.8 billion will come from private construction
which covers residential and nonresidential projects. Addressing the
3.72 million housing backlog through the construction of low cost and
socialized housing will answer the demand side. Meanwhile, the growth
of urban centers and the continued development of industrial centers is
counted on to sustain the boom in the nonresidential sector.

Government construction, on the other hand accounts for P43.4 billion
of the total. This covers infrastructure development in power, energy
and electricity, transportation, water resources, social infrastructure
and communication.

Licensed contractors are further classified into general
building, general engineering and specialty contractors.
General building companies are involved in the development of a
wide range of structures and buildings. Contractors who perform
civil engineering works requiring specialized engineering such
as construction of irrigation, drainage, water supply
sewerage, flood control, highways and roads, harbors, docks and
wharves, shipyards, ports and heavy industrial establishments are
classified under general engineering. Specialty contractors are
those who undertake work requiring specialize building trades.
Majority of contractors belong to the general engineering/building
class.

DECS, DoST agency launch school, forest park program

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

Filipino schoolchildren can better appreciate the importance of
protecting the environment through a program which has been created.

Called "School Forest Park Program," it will support the government's
clean and green initiative and consequently, create consciousness among
children on the value of environment protection and conservation of its
biodiversity.

The Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and Philippine
Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and
Development (PCARRD) joined hands through a signing of the memorandum
of agreement (MoA) to fully implement the program.

Signatories to the agreement were DECS Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria and
PCARRD executive director Wlliam D. Dar. Los Banos-based PCARRD, an
agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DoST), monitors,
coordinates, and evaluates research and development (R&D) activities in
agriculture, environment, and natural resources in the country.

In the agreement, DECS will identify the area within the school
premises to be designated for the program, allocate the necessary funds
and resources, and supervise overall implementation.

PCARRD, on the other hand, will provide technical assistance to the
identified schools, help identify and source forest tree species and
materials indigenous to the area, and encourage/involve other agencies/
organization in the project.

Secretary Gloria said the new program will complement DECS's existing
"School-in-a-Garden" project.

In the last few years, specifically during the Aquino administration,
both public and private schools have strengthened their curricula by
adopting environment-related subjects.

The concept of sustainable development has also been integrated in
various subjects in both primary and secondary levels.

Driven by the global concern on environmental protection and wildlife
conservation, specifically through the Earth Summit in 1992, several
local colleges and universities are now offering special courses on
environmental management.

IT"S ONLY MONEY: Sustaining the sustainable

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Mario P. Chanco

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), like any financial institution
deserving the name, is worried. In a story bylined by BusinessWorld
reporters Maricris C. Carlos and Elisha R. Garcia earlier this week,
the IMF expressed more than a bit of curiosity about the rate of
national economic growth and wondered out loud - as anyone in their
position appears well entitled to wonder - if the Philippines had
enough growth sustainability factors to keep up with its spending.

Of course, this whole exercise is about money. It's only money.

It's money that interests the money merchants and the money spenders,
but the IMF is quoted as worried about the country's money inflows. The
bulk appears to come, not from the hot shots riding the rails on the
Bicol-North super expressways, but from overseas contract workers
(OCWs).

Either kind of legal tender will pay for life's real or imagined needs.
But when overseas income starts surging 76% higher in the first six
months of 1996 compared to that of a year ago, it's time to look at the
color of one's money.

When one considers that there has been a continuous downtrend in the
number of Filipinos employed overseas in these last years, the innuendo
turns absolutely tantalizing. One wonders: Did those overseas workers
we have left somehow marry into rich families on the desert sands? Or
is there a new kind of corporate capital sharing now at work that we
will never hear of in the country?

I remember, some five or six years ago, watching at a big Quezon City
car exchange where a transaction involving a large passenger van was
going on. The deal may have been several days in the making, but when I
chanced on the scene money was already changing hands. The buyer was a
shapely Filipina who could have been a stewardess, nurse or just an
overseas spellbinder. But she was tough and spoke in knowledgeable
Tagalese that she intended to get value for her money.

She took out so many high-denomination bills from a large suitcase I
thought she had a direct pipeline to a next-door bank. Finally, when
all the accessories, tires, papers, etc. had been dumped inside the
van, she and two other companions got in and drove away in a cloud of
dust.

At another time, I watched at a money changer's shop while two
foreigners dickered for centavos on the standard peso-dollar exchange
rate - and ended up changing $20 per head. Behind them, a short, squat
Filipino OCW walked up and waited patiently at the counter. He
deposited a thick wad of hundred-dollar bills big enough to choke a
dinosaur. He had a proper escort, this man had; when they zoomed off
into the sunset, he made the old cowboy John Wayne look Lilliputian by
comparison.

So there you have it - big bucks and big money from fewer Filipino
workers overseas. But they still float enough high-octane gas to fuel
the consumerist boom in cars, housing, food, appliances, durables. The
very breath of life, the IMF seems to say, which makes even us ask
plaintively - how long is this bubble going to last? How long before it
blows up on our faces, and another IMF set of conditions is imposed to
make Filipinos live within their means?

Filipino overseas workers, it is said, are not likely to return home
soon, so their source of funds will not be quickly cut off. So if that
is OK, what's this talk about growth sustainability all about?
Something to keep the boys better treated for all the tough years
they've been having? Or is it simply because, with so many small
Filipinos doing their bit to keep the nation afloat and sustainable, we
still need to justify ourselves before yet another level of judges?

Dept of Envt and Natural Resources okays social forestry rules

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Digna V. Velasco

New rules on social forestry were approved last week by the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

Started during the early years of the Aquino administration, social
forestry was promoted as a livelihood scheme for upland communities.

The new rules, spelled out in DENR Administrative Order No. 96-24,
series of 1996, are aimed at ensuring "equitable access and sharing of
rights to natural resources development and utilization by giving the
people, particularly the poorer sectors of society, the opportunity to
participate actively in forest plantation development."

DENR will grant Socialized Industrial Forest Management Agreement or
SIFMA to qualified program participants and will include a provision on
security of tenure.

The concept was derived from the Industrial Forest Management Agreement
or IFMA which taps corporate participants.

Under the SIFMA, each family can develop and manage forest areas from 1
to 10 hectares. For associations and cooperatives, sizes of awarded
areas range from 11 to less than 500 hectares.

A non-refundable application fee of P500 for every hectare awarded will
be collected by DENR.

Filipinos of legal age and preferably residents of the municipality
where the project will be located are qualified to apply for concession
areas.

Associations and cooperatives applying should have offices located in
the province where the SIFMA is located and are duly registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Cooperative Development
Authority.

Moreover, they must be financially and technically capable of
developing the area. Applicants should not have had any agreements,
permits or licenses to use forest lands or resources cancelled due to
their inability to comply with DENR requirements nor are they holders
of any existing forest permit, license, lease or management agreement.

A qualified SIFMA applicant is entitled to the following:

* harvest, sell or use all planted crops, mostly trees for wood
production, non-timber species and other cash crops that may be
interplanted, except those retained for environmental protection;

* export logs, lumber and other forest products harvested according to
the government's allocation system;

* exemption from paying forest charges derived from the plantation;

* reasonable compensation if the SIFMA is cancelled without due cause;

* high priority if future rules allow a more permanent tenurial
arrangement;

* no restrictions on use of the SIFMA as collateral for loans to
improve the area, provided this is approved by the issuing IFMA
authority; and

* free technical assistance for SIFMA holders wanting to confederate
into a larger organization.

SIFMA is valid for 25 years and renewable for another 25 years.

DENR Secretary Victor O. Ramos said SIFMA will promote an adequate and
steady supply of timber and other forest products for the domestic and
export market; accelerate reforestation and rehabilitation of the
country's open and denuded forest lands and effectively protect and
conserve existing natural forests, soil, water and biodiversity; while
at the same time give more equitable access to forest resources and
help uplift the economic situation of people, particularly in the
uplands.

Gov"t seals wastewater tunnels of Mandaluyong sugar refinery

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Digna V. Velasco

Wastewater tunnels of a sugar refinery in Mandaluyong City were closed
last week by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

The Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) of the DENR ruled the sealing of
the Noah's Ark Sugar Refinery's drainage tunnels with cement fillings
and steel plates.

A laboratory analysis of the refinery's wastewater showed a solid
matter density higher than what the government allows. For DENR, solid
particles emitted into a water system should take an hour to settle at
its bottom.

The closure order was first served on October 17, 1995 because Noah's
Ark failed to install an adequate wastewater treatment plant (WTP).
Five days after, the firm filed a motion for reconsideration which the
board denied for "lack of merit."

On November 22, 1995 however, a six-week temporary lifting order (TLO)
was issued but subject to three conditions including the construction
of an adequate WTP.

PAB extended the TLO for 60 days on January 24, 1996 with instructions
to the DENR-National Capital Region (DENR-NCR) to test the firm's
wastewater regularly.

On June 13, 1996, the TLO was again extended for another month "to
allow the respondent to further adjust its WTP and for resampling
purposes."

Last August 6, PAB ordered the reimposition of the standing
close-and-desist order (CDO) which was served 10 days later by DENR-NCR
officials led by Environment Management Engineer Danilo Galagnara.

They noted one of the three tunnel outfalls was below the surface of
the river so they had to come back in the afternoon at low tide to seal
it. They reported the firm's administrative manager, Luis Ramos,
prevented them from carrying out the said order.

PAB made its first endorsement to DENR Secretary Victor Ramos for the
filing of criminal charges against the firm. Last September 11, the
refinery's drainage tunnels were finally sealed.

Gerardo Reyes, Noah's Ark's public relations officer, denied some of
DENR's accusations. He told BusinessWorld that no wastewater sampling
was scheduled that last week of June when the "organic-laden
wastewater" was taken.

Instead, a DENR-NCR monitoring team went to check on the air pollution
complaints of Mandaluyong City Congressman Neptali Gonzales, Jr.
against the firm. Noah's Ark passed the air pollution test.

"Unfortunately, a companion of the team saw the wastewater flowing into
the bed which has not yet passed through our treatment plant. He took
some samples of it and had it tested. Predictably, we failed. That
became the basis of the CDO automatic reimposition," Mr. Reyes related.

Mr. Reyes claimed that Noah's Ark had an existing WTP when the CDO was
first issued. The firm had failures in operations due to a boiler
breakdown and "we can't assure a 100% operational WTP." Thus, the CDO
was issued.

The CDO was temporarily lifted with the firm subjected to close
wastewater monitoring. The refinery adopted the biological system which
used activated sludge or bacteria to eat up the wastes in the aeration
tank.

From the aeration tank, wastewater passes through the resettling tank
then finally discharged into the Pasig River.

The TLO was extended for three months so DENR could continue monitoring
the firm's improvements.

Mr. Reyes related, "DENR told us that the Biological Oxygen Demand
(BOD) level was the critical aspect so we worked on it." BOD is the
capacity of the water to supply oxygen needed by organisms to survive.

Mr. Reyes added, "We passed the required BOD but we had a high
percentage of solid particles. We were again told to improve on our
WTP."

"But we were nearing the end of the TLO extension. PAB said there is no
need for a written petition for another extension. It was then that the
unfortunate testing came, resulting in the CDO automatic reimposition."

Mr. Reyes also denied DENR's accusation that Mr. Ramos, Noah's Ark's
administrative manager, stopped the closure order.

He added that on August 21, the firm submitted another motion for
reconsideration to PAB, citing that the firm received only last July 16
the one-month TLO extension issued last June 13.

The motion argued that the TLO should have lapsed only last August 17.
The refinery also cited substantial losses due to the "outright closure
of production" as the raw sugar worth P10 million in its production
lines would be wasted.

A separate sampling and laboratory analysis of DENR's River
Rehabilitation Secretariat last July 1 showed "marked improvements,"
with the concentration of solid particles reduced significantly.

"According to our consultants, DENR's standard is based on tap water
such as that supplied by the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System.
Can that be expected of wastewater?" he asked.

The refinery has also installed a clarifier and screen to further
filter the solids before final discharge into the Pasig River.

Mr. Reyes said the management decided to voluntarily stop its
operations about a week before DENR's actual closure.

As a last resort, the firm might consider ocean-dumping as an
alternative and they have already applied to the Philippine Coast Guard
for this.

The refinery's wastewater, he said, can be good fish food since it is
mostly molasses from the sludge of sugar cane.

The firm also has its own tadpoles and barges to transport wastewater
to the sites to be identified by the Philippine Coast Guard.

But DENR authorities said this is still subject to PAB's approval and
had to be closely coordinated with the DENR-NCR officers and the
Philippine Coast Guard.

On the firm incurring losses due to the closure, PAB argued that other
firms have always raised this reason which is not enough to stay the
CDO. "Economic losses are expected in all firms meted with CDOs," the
board explained.

For Noah's Ark refinery, DENR's closure action was "counterproductive"
to President Fidel Ramos's program of Philippines 2000.

"We in the private sector are working hand in hand with the government.
But we are confused on the role of the DENR. Is it there to close down
firms?

"Shouldn't its role be in helping firms comply with its standards?
DENR's role should be a working relationship with the private sector
and not just a police body out to close firms.

"Will CDO be the remedy? We wouldn't question it if we had been
defiant. But we had spent about P5 million to improve our WTP and
comply with DENR's requirements," Mr. Reyes said.

Congress wants Pagcor to fund Oil Price Stabilization Fund

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.

After the Philippine National Oil Co. (PNOC), Congress is hoping to tap
funds from last year's top earner, the state-owned Philippine Amusement
and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), to wipe out the P2.3 billion deficit of the
Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF).

Early this year, PNOC shelled out P10 billion from its coffers for the
OPSF. However, this was not enough to reimburse all pending claims of
three oil companies.

Now, Congress thinks Pagcor, which earned P5.86 billion in profits last
year, is the next potential OPSF donor.

Taguig Rep. Dante Tinga, chairman of the committee on energy at the
House of Representatives, told BusinessWorld the Lower House hopes to
settle the OPSF deficit before March 1997. This is when the government
is slated to lift all controls, including on pricing, on the oil
industry.

"There are actually many sources of funds to (address) the OPSF
deficit. But Pagcor is the most capable to provide money to the OPSF,"
he said.

Pagcor, a government-owned-and-controlled corporation which runs all
casinos nationwide, is considered the most profitable of all state-run
companies.

The three oil companies - Petron Corp., Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.
(PSPC) and Caltex (Phils.) Inc. - have turned down requests by the
Department of Energy for them to condone pending claims from the OPSF.

Their claims against the fund is estimated to have reached P2.3 billion
in August.

Officials of the oil firms earlier said they cannot write off their
claims from the buffer fund since this will affect their balance sheets
and thus hinder plans for expansion.

Of the P10 billion PNOC coughed up, only P9 billion was paid to the oil
companies. The DoE decided to keep the P1 billion as buffer fund to
cushion any oil price increase during the partial deregulation of the
oil industry.

But Energy Secretary Francisco Viray had floated the idea of using the
P1 billion, or whatever will be left of it, to pay part of the oil
firms' OPSF claims.

Mr. Tinga said the Lower House will be supportive of Mr. Viray's
suggestion although this will have to be legislated.

The OPSF is a buffer fund used to shield domestic oil prices against
radical movements in crude prices abroad and the fluctuations in the
foreign exchange rates.

The OPSF turned red in May last year given the unexpected increases in
the price of crude oil in the world market.

Even with PNOC's substantial contribution, the Energy Regulatory Board
(ERB) had to increase oil prices by an average of P0.55 per liter last
February to address part of the OPSF deficit.

Officials of the Department of Finance (DoF) said oil prices may have
to be raised by another P0.11 per liter to produce money that will be
paid to the oil companies.

The DoF said the government is cash-strapped to provide any more funds,
thus the OPSF burden has to be passed on to consumers.

National Economic and Development Authority Board approves 10 projects

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Ma. Salve I. Duplito

Ten projects worth P97.5 billion were approved yesterday by the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board.

The NEDA Board, a cabinet-level body, is chaired by President Ramos. It
gives the final approval of projects before they are carried out.

The 10 projects will cost the government P33.7 billion in local funding
and P63.3 billion in foreign loans through official development
assistance and grants.

The San Roque Multipurpose Project accounted for the biggest chunk of
the funding, costing P24.9 billion.

The site of the Multipurpose Project is the Agno River Basin in
Pangasinan. The project includes a 345-megawatt power plant and
irrigation for 70,822 hectares of agricultural land.

Documents from NEDA, however, show the project is not financially
viable but the economic rate of return to be gleaned from power
generation and irrigation is expected to make up for the financial
unviability of the project.

The Light Rail Transit III was the second biggest project, costing the
government P18.3 billion in foreign loans. Local funding is not needed
for the project as the project is identified under the
build-lease-transfer scheme.

The LRT III, which has been delayed for almost a year now because of
right-of-way and squatter relocation problems, is expected to be
completed in October next year with construction starting not later
than this month.

NEDA's Infrastructure Staff earlier questioned its viability as project
cost has ballooned to $655 million from the original $300 million. The
Department of Transportation and Communications, however, pushed hard
for the project.

The NEDA Board retained the non-separability feature of commercial
development and the train service itself which the Metro Rail Transit
Corp. (MRTC) had been proposing to remove.

The MRTC, the consortium of some of the biggest developers in the
country, earlier sought to continue with the commercial development of
the depot site in North Edsa and other sites even if the rail component
does not push through. NEDA, however, blocked the act to ensure that
LRT III construction pushes through.

The Sixth Roads Improvement Project, which will be financed mainly
through a P9.5-billion loan from the Asian Development Bank and Japan
Export Import Bank, seeks to rehabilitate the national roads network
through repairs and constructions of bridges and roads in crucial
points nationwide.

The other seven approved, with investments totalling P44 billion, are:
Third Elementary Education Projects I and II, Agrarian Reform
Communities Project, Growth with Equity in Mindanao Program, and three
power projects under the National Power Corp.

APEC UPDATE: APEC needs private sector to solve energy problem

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Leda A. Esguerra

Energy ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) urged
a tie-up between governments and the business sector to address the
region's rising power demand.

The call was contained in a declaration following a meeting in Sydney,
Australia, in preparation for this November's APEC summit in Subic.

The ministers expect a 50% to 80% increase in the region's electricity
demand from 1996 to 2010, requiring some $1.6 trillion in investment
capital.

"If such growth is to be realized, business sector finance for power
infrastructure will be essential," they said.

For a strong partnership with the business industry, the governments of
member economies need to find means to reduce investment risks for the
business community and encourage them to invest in power
infrastructure, the ministers explained.

They stressed, "APEC governments must play a catalytic role in creating
the project approval, regulatory and financial conditions necessary to
mobilize the investment capital required from the business community."

Apart from the need to introduce reforms to mobilize private sector
investments in the power sector, the ministers identified a series of
objectives they will be reporting to the APEC leaders.

The objectives are: the improvement of regional energy security by
opening up the energy markets and expanding current supply capacity and
energy conservation; the need to come up with strategic approach to
reducing the environmental impact of power projects.

Also to be reported are the need for a framework to reduce business
costs through cooperation on energy standards; and the adoption of
energy policy principles to give an impetus to regional initiatives to
reform energy policies for incorporation into domestic energy policy
deliberations of member economies.

APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand
and the United States.

FVR okays blacklist rules for erring gov"t contractors

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

Erring contractors of the government's infrastructure projects will
have to shape up or else be blacklisted from future construction
projects.

The guidelines on blacklisting erring contractors were given the
Presidential nod during the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) Board meeting held yesterday.

The government intends to finalize an Executive Order (EO) by the end
of the year to implement the guidelines.

NEDA director-general Cielito F. Habito told BusinessWorld the
President bypassed the usual repetitive discussions and approved the
guidelines to fast-track the implementation of the EO.

"The President said it's about time to have a uniform set of guidelines
to weed out misfits in the government's infrastructure projects," Mr.
Habito said. Mr. Habito added, however, the President ordered several
clarifications specifically on conflicts of interest.

"Some contractors are just dummies of local government officials. We
have to set the rule on how to deal with this," the President was
quoted as saying during the meeting.

Before the State of the Nation Address last June, the President visited
the road construction at the Quezon City Circle and was reportedly
disappointed at the project's slow development.

Under the current system, agencies have different guidelines and
sanctions for erring contractors and have no common list of blacklisted
contractors.

This situation allows contractors to escape detection and repetitively
win in project biddings despite their poor performance.

In the new set of guidelines, a uniform set of guidelines and sanctions
has been set. The sanctions range from suspension to perpetual
disqualification.

Contractors can be blacklisted if proven to have used falsified
documents or borrowed license during bidding, rigging of bidding,
inability to comply with requirements like affidavits on time, delays
in construction and low quality of work.

Meanwhile, President Ramos yesterday approved the extension of the 3%
duty on portland cement until 1997 to prevent any sudden increase in
cement prices.

The decision was reached upon recommendation by the Committee on
Tariffs and Related Matters (TRM) of the NEDA Board.

The extension was one of the executive actions targetted by NEDA in its
Action Plan Against Inflation. The move is seen to dampen uptick in
cost of housing and repairs which accounts for 13.3% of inflation.

In the earlier plan, cement duty is scheduled to go up to 10% in
January 1, as mandated by Executive Order 284.

However, since the current cement shortage is expected to stretch until
1998, private sector representatives asked the government to postpone
the increase in import duty to prevent importations from being too
expensive and therefore ease cement shortage.

Data from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) show demand for
cement next year will balloon to 407 million bags from 334 million this
year, even as supply is only expected to reach 401.8 million bags. This
translates to a 5.4 million supply deficit.

In 1998, the situation will even be bleaker despite the operation of
new plants, DTI said. Deficit is expected to shoot up to 42.5 million
bags.

Taxwise or Otherwise: Sellers to Philippine Economic Zone Authority firms

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Romeo B. Cruz

Sellers of goods or services dealing with an enterprise registered with
the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are often confronted with
the issue on the proper treatment of such transaction for Value-Added
Tax (VAT) purposes. What may appear simple is complicated due to
differences in interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the VAT
Law and related legislations.

The provisions of the new VAT Law and implementing revenue regulations
on effectively zero-rated sale could have provided the ready answer.
Under the regulations, sales of goods and services by a VAT-registered
person to a person or entity who has been granted indirect tax
exemption under special laws are, in effect, zero-rated. In the
regulations and the memorandum circular, the enumeration of effectively
zero-rated sales of goods specifies sale to Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA)-and Cooperative Development Authority (CDA)-registered
enterprises, to PEZA registered enterprises, and to Asian Development
Bank and International Rice Research Institute, pursuant to respective
laws and international agreements. However, this specific reference is
not contained in the enumeration of effectively zero-rated sales of
services to these enterprises.

It is our position that while not explicitly stated, it is the intent
of the rules that sales of services to these specific enterprises and
organizations are to be treated in the same manner as the sales of
goods, and are effectively zero-rated.

The PEZA law states that all privileges, benefits, advantages or
exemptions accorded to special economic zones created under RA 7227
(e.g. SBMA and CDA) shall also be accorded to PEZA firms. One of the
privileges enjoyed by SBMA enterprises is that purchases of raw
materials, capital goods and equipment and services are considered
effectively zero-rated for VAT purposes (Sec. 4 (A) of Rev. Regs. 1-95).

Inasmuch as PEZA firms enjoy this same privilege, the sale of products
and services to PEZA firms should be treated as effectively zero-rated.
Thus, the seller is liable to zero per cent VAT on such sale and is
still entitled to claim input taxes. Since the seller will not pass on
any VAT, PEZA firms will enjoy a 10% savings on purchases made.

The seller is, however, required to submit an application for
zero-rating to the Revenue District Office having jurisdiction over its
principal place of business. Without an approved application for
zero-rating, the sale would merely be considered exempt from VAT,
therefore, the seller cannot deduct the input taxes paid on products
sold against its output VAT.

(Mr. Romeo B. Cruz is a manager at the Tax and Corporate Services
Department of Joaquin Cunanan & Co., a member firm of the Price
Waterhouse Worldwide Organization.)

Local, Japanese groups to slug it out for 20% of National Steel Corp. on
Oct. 2

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ma. Clarissa S. Batino

At least 13 companies have signified their intentions to buy into the
National Steel Corp. (NSC) when the government bids out 20% of the firm
on October 2 for an expected take of not less than P4.5 billion.

The companies represented in yesterday's pre-bidding conference
conducted by the National Development Co. (NDC) include four Japanese
conglomerates, three investment affiliates representing big clients,
prominent and low-key business names.

Among the Japanese firms are Tomen Corp., Kawasho Corp., Mitsui & Co.,
Ltd. and Marubeni Corp.

ING Barings, Urban Bank and Lunar Holdings of broker Luis Virata were
also present. Sources said they could be representing big names wanting
to elude publicity.

An example could be plastics tycoon William Gatchalian who is said to
be talking intently with the Malaysian majority group in NSC for
significant exposure in the country's largest steel firm.

The interest of now Hong Kong-based Roberto Ongpin in NSC was also
confirmed with the attendance of APC Group formerly Asian Petroleum
Corp.

APC is 50-owned by Mr. Ongpin's Belle Corp. which is part of his AIA
Holdings. Talks are rife at the stock market that Mr. Ongpin will be
converting APC into a holding company which he will use to penetrate
NSC and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).

Mr. Ongpin has been eyeing the steel firm, even before the Malaysians
entered the picture. In fact, he participated in the privatization but
lost to the Malaysians. He and Mr. Gatchalian have been meeting often
with Wing Tiek Holdings Berhad for possible tie-ups, sources said.

Shipping magnate Doris Magsaysay-Ho also sent a representative through
her National Marine Corp. Other prospective bidders are Cathay Pacific
Steel Corp., another firm represented by the Embassy of Spain, current
NSC supplier Reliance Commodities and an obscure firm, Rico Enterprises.

NDC, the government's holding arm, will be dividing the 448,683,666
shares into four blocks comprising five per cent each of the company.

Arthur Aguilar, general manager of NDC explained this is to broaden the
ownership base of the company and even make it more marketable.

"At an indicative price of P10 each, this will entail a large sum of
money. Instead of doing an all-or-nothing type of bidding, we decided
to split it up," Mr. Aguilar explained.

While it is possible a single bidder will get all four chunks, it can
also happen that an entity may bid for the four and not get any, the
NDC official noted.

A bidder is required to put 10% upfront of his bid price upon
submission of the bid, 50% not later than October 25 and 40% within
ninety days from the awarding.

NDC noted the number of shares to be offered may increase depending on
the decision of Wing Tiek's partner, Marubeni Corp. on its pending $50
million obligation as part of the Malaysian's second tranche.

Wing Tiek is in the process of acquiring 75% of NSC. It has paid for
more than 60% but liquidity crunch has delayed its payment of the $90
million supposedly due in August.

It worked out a strategic venture with Marubeni wherein the latter will
buy 6% of NSC shares the Malaysians earlier committed to take.

But Marubeni is said to be having second thoughts on plunking in $50
million (P1.3 billion) without the resolution of the land issue.

NSC has about P700 million worth of properties it had to spin-off since
it is now majority-owned by a foreigner. The Constitution expressly
stated no foreign entity can own land in the Philippines.

As of press time, nothing has been heard of Marubeni's decision. Mr.
Aguilar said if Marubeni keeps an uncertain stance, then the NDC board
will meet this week to decide whether to include the 6% commitment in
the put-option clause.

With no takers, this chunk will revert to Wing Tiek again. And NDC will
be left to contend with another round of IOUs.

PTT of Thailand, Coastal Petroleum joint venture to build local gas
stations

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.

State-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) has firmed up plans
to tie up with United States-based Coastal Petroleum to put up 200
service stations here, sources told BusinessWorld yesterday.

Sources said PTT has secured the approval of the Thai government for
the said project. Officials of the firm are due to arrive this week to
finalize the joint-venture agreement with Coastal.

Coastal which runs a large oil depot in Subic Bay Freeport in Olongapo
will be supplying the petroleum products to the Thai firm.

PTT will concentrate on marketing fuel products in Metro Manila.
Initial investments for the project is estimated at $120 million.

Coastal operates the Coastal Subic Bay Terminal, Inc. which stores 2.4
million barrels of oil. It also runs a similar depot in Clark Field in
Pampanga that has a storage capacity of half a million barrels.

The project will be the first for PTT. Coastal has been operating the
Subic depot since 1993 shortly after the US vacated its military base
in Olongapo.

Coastal has consistently been supplying any shortfall in the domestic
petroleum demand. The firm provides at least 20,000 barrels a day to
augment local requirements which averages 350,000 daily.

A Coastal official said plans are under way to for a $20-million
upgrading bid of the firm's existing pipeline in Clark to facilitate
transport of fuel products.

Aside from the PTT-Coastal project, no other newcomers in the partially
deregulated oil industry have finalized plans to invest in marketing
petroleum products. But Department of Energy (DoE) director Zenaida
Monzada said other firms can actually pursue investment interests
without informing the DoE.

"This is one of the results of a deregulated industry. They (investors)
can opt to come to us when they have their respective projects already
in place," she said.

The government has eased rules on the entry of new players in the
petroleum industry as part of its economic liberalization program. The
partial deregulation phase where pricing remains semi-regulated by the
Energy Regulatory Board will last until February next year. With full
deregulation a month later, petroleum pricing will be market-dictated.

Luis Dizon group files cases vs SEC at the appellate court, Ombudsman

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Larina  G. Perez and Norman C. Aquino

After being prevented from taking control of Dizon Copper Silver Mines,
Inc. (DCSMI) because of a recent temporary restraining order (TRO)
issued by a hearing officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the former management of the company went to the Court of
Appeals (CA) asking that the actions taken during the stockholders
meeting held last September 4 be nullified.

The hearing at the SEC was held to decide whether or not the TRO issued
last September 16, 1996 by hearing officer James Abugan which is
effective for 72 hours should be extended.

At the same time, the former management led by Dr. Luis Dizon also
filed before the SEC a motion to dismiss the case and an opposition to
the extension of the TRO.

The CA earlier issued a TRO preventing the Commission from enforcing
its order directing the officers of DCSMI to hold a stockholders
meeting. The TRO was issued in light of a petition filed by the bloc
led by Dr. Luis Dizon before the CA last September 3 seeking to stop
the stockholders meeting.

However, the stockholders present during the assembly went on with the
meeting claiming they constitute the majority. Moreover, they said they
were not parties to the TRO because it was only the SEC which was
enjoined by the CA from enforcing its order. During the meeting, the
group also elected a new set of directors.

Atty. Armando M. Marcelo, counsel for Dr. Dizon's group, said yesterday
aside from asking the CA to declare as null and void the actions taken
during the stockholders meeting, the group also asked the appellate
court to hold in contempt DCSMI's elected officers led by chairperson
Teresita Dizon.

He said they also asked the SEC to dismiss the case because the matter
has been elevated to the CA. "The SEC can't entertain the case anymore
because only the CA can do that at this point," Mr. Marcelo said.

In yesterday's hearing at the SEC, Mr. Marcelo said the TRO issued last
September 16 is "void" and "nonexistent" because it was issued by a
hearing officer who is not authorized to do so.

Citing SEC's special rules for the issuance of TROs and writ of
preliminary injunction, Mr. Marcelo said only the director of the
Securities Investigation and Clearing Division (SICD) can issue TROs.

The rules read in part: "If the matter is of extreme urgency, such that
unless a TRO is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will
arise, the SICD director shall issue the TRO effective only for 72
hours..."

"I would like to stress, there is not even anything (TRO) to extend.
The rules on the issuance of TROs are very clear," Mr. Marcelo said.

Atty. Manuel Singson, counsel for the newly elected board of directors,
said even if the TRO issued by Mr. Abugan is indeed invalid, the SEC
can still issue another TRO.

Atty. Efren Moncupa, counsel for the same group, said they will pursue
their move for the issuance of a TRO because the operations of DCSMI
are adversely affected by the ongoing controversy. He said at present,
the operations of the company are suspended because its office has been
padlocked by the former management.

He said the group will file a motion with the CA to dismiss the other
group's petition so that the new directors and officers can assume
their posts at DCSMI.

Meanwhile, a stockholder of DCSMI yesterday filed graft charges before
the Office of the Ombudsman against SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay, Jr.
and five others.

Also charged were commissioners Fe Eloisa Gloria, SEC lawyers Ruben
Ladia, Juanito Almosa, Benito Cataran and Rosalina Tesorio.

Mr. Sinugbuhan accused the SEC officials of giving undue injury to
DCSMI by giving unwarranted benefits to Teresita Dizon, Lourdes Dizon,
Fortunata Matsuda, Juvencio Dizon, Ramona Feliciano and Deogracias
Datu, also stockholders of the mining company.

He claimed the SEC officials conspired to illegally hold back two TROs
issued by SEC hearing officer Evilio Pomento on September 4.

The first order restrained the holding of a stockholders meeting the
following day until alleged tampering of proxy votes and dissipation of
corporate funds would have been resolved.

The second order barred the group of majority stockholder Teresita
Dizon from being nominated and elected to the mining firm's board of
directors.

Mr. Sinugbuhan said by suppressing the TROs, the SEC officials paved
the way for a romp election by Ms. Dizon's group, causing confusion
among DCSMI stockholders.

He also scored the officials for allegedly meddling in the disposition
of the mining firm's cases.

"It is about time that the corrupt and high-handed acts of these
government officials be exposed and put to an end," Mr. Sinugbuhan said.

Mr. Pomento had issued the TROs based on the claims of DCSMI's
incumbent management that there was massive cheating in the validation
of proxies, the bone of contention between the two groups of
stockholders.

Mr. Ladia, officer-in-charge of SEC's SICD), did not release Mr.
Pomento's orders, claiming he saw the copies of the orders on September
5 or a day late and that such orders need to be reviewed prior to their
release.

Congress to probe Manuela Land and Houses Corp"s ouster in John Hay
bidding

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ronaldo F. Jabal

Congress has stepped into the controversial bidding of the Club John
Hay conducted by the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA).

Yesterday, sixteen congressmen called for an investigation of the
bidding. Led by House of Representatives ad hoc oversight committee on
bases conversion chairman and Pampanga Rep. Carmelo Lazatin, a group of
solons want to find out if the recent disqualification of Manuela Land
and Houses Corp. (ML&H) by the BCDA in the bidding for Club John Hay in
Baguio City will result in huge losses to the government.

"The committee has been reliably informed that the result of the recent
bidding process will result in huge losses to the government...
Therefore, (we) resolved to direct the ad hoc oversight committee on
bases conversion to thoroughly conduct an inquiry interest of the
government," the group said.

Besides Mr. Lazatin, the other congressmen who called for the probe are
Reps. Bernardo Vergara, Jose Yap, Felicito Payumo, Herminio Aquino,
Jovito Claudio, Zenaida Ducut, James Gordon, Renato Diaz, Roilo Golez,
Victor Ortega, Dante Tinga, Eduardo Ermita, Jose Cojuangco, Amadeo
Perez and Oscar Rodriquez. All of them are members of the committee.

In a resolution, the congressmen noted that in a recent bidding, the
BCDA awarded the right to develop the Club John Jay through a 25-year
lease contract to ML&H consortium composed of Manuela Corporation,
Thailand's Land & Houses Public Co. Ltd.. Asia Pacific Planning and
Evaluation Co., First Asia Eagles Capital Corp. and AB Capital and
Investment Corp.

ML&H bidded P1.588 billion, which is more than three times bigger than
the next bidder, the Fil Estate-Penta Capital Group. The latter offered
only P425 million.

However, the BCDA declared ML&H in default for failing to meet the
deadline to sign a lease agreement for the development of the project
and forfeited the P100-million cash deposit the group posted during the
auction last July. As such, the contract was awarded to the second
highest bidder, Penta Capital-Fil Estate.

BCDA chairman Victorino Basco was earlier quoted as having said the
decision to award the contract to the second highest bidder came
following the opinion of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel
(OGCC) that ML&H violated the terms of reference of the John Hay
auction.

ML&H reportedly refused to sign an agreement with BCDA due to concerns
over the total land area covered by the contract. It claimed the area
that would be available for development was only 121.77 hectares
because more than half of the 246.99 has that BCDA bidded out were
protected forest lands and untitled lands.

shares to raise funds for projects

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Larina G. Perez

Riviera Golf Club, Inc. is offering 2,250 golf club shares to the
public to raise P1.2 billion for its resort and residential project in
Silang, Cavite.

In an application filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), Riviera Golf said the offered shares are broken down as follows:
1,328 class "A" common shares; 210 class "B" common shares; and 712
class "C" common shares. Priced at P550,000 each, the shares are being
offered to the public.

The golf course, which is owned and being developed by the Armed Forces
of the Philippines Retirement and Separation Benefits System
(AFP-RSBS), will provide the main attraction for the entire sports and
leisure complex project. The sports complex, covering 44% of the total
312-hectare land area, will consist of two 18-hole championship golf
courses and a country club.

Riviera Golf Club has commissioned CCA International Ltd. to operate
the golf club. Aside from operating the club, CCA will also provide
pre-opening assistance during the development phase.

CCA will also recommend and review overall club concepts and detailed
facility plans, establish purchasing and control systems for clubhouse
and golf-course related equipment, as well as monitor work progress and
quality standards during the development period. It will also hire and
train the club's staff.

Among the support facilities and amenities to be included in the golf
clubhouse are: a fine dining restaurant, pro shops, tee bar, putting
green; a golf academy, and a driving range among others.

The construction of the golf club started last January and development
has reached 30% accomplishment. It will be completed by December of
next year.

As a fully integrated sports complex, the property will also feature
residential units. The whole complex will be completed within two years.

AFP-RSBS, which started operations in 1977 with a mandate of building
up the pension fund of the AFP, has broadened its scope to include
several real estate projects. Its investment in real estate account for
48.73% of its total investment portfolio of about P9.5 billion. At
present, AFP-RSBS has P11 billion in assets and P8 billion in fund
equity.

Its projects include: San Lorenzo South Subdivision in Sta. Rosa
Laguna; Las Pinas Royale Estates; Chinatown Steel Towers in Binondo;
the Orchard Golf and Country Club in Dasmarinas, Cavite; Eastridge Golf
and Country Club in Binangonan, Rizal; and the Enchanted Kingdom.

VIEW FROM THE TOP: Real competitive advantage

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ma. Clarissa S. Batino

In today's cutthroat competition, business guru and strategist Michael
Porter comes with his main edict likened to the classic saying that
"the battle is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift."

An author of three books in competitive advantage, Mr. Porter was in
Manila recently to share his insights with Filipino managers.

He said a gung ho zest for operational excellence may fatten up profits
for some years. But without the proper allowance for sustainable
development, the driving force will weaken and like karma, the
shortcomings will eventually catch up with the entrepreneur.

Mr. Porter encouraged firms to innovate and recreate, to step out of
the purely profit-driven mold of today's business into a dynamic,
well-balanced and prosperous industry ready to face the global battle
that has started.

He joined Harvard Business School in 1973 and has advised international
firms including AT&T, First Boston, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard,
NEC Corp., among others.

In an exclusive interview with BusinessWorld, Mr. Porter shares some of
his insights into gaining a real competitive advantage.

BusinessWorld (BW): What is the formula for competitive advantage you
speak of?

Michael Porter (MP): It's hard to give it in a sentence. The simplest
way of saying it is that competitive advantage grows out of choosing to
be unique in some way in your business. And choosing to be unique means
that you must limit yourself by not doing everything in the industry.
But by choosing to do a few things that you want to be special at.
That's the essence of competitive advantage. Not spreading yourself too
thin. Like what most companies do. Basically, in the Philippines where
there are so many opportunities and so much growth, there is a very
strong pressure to just pursue all these great ideas.

BW: You say one has to find a niche for the company?

MP: Well its not necessarily a niche. It can serve quite a wide market.
But you got to find a particular kind of value that you are offering to
your customers. It might be many customers. It might be just a few
customers. And I talked today about the different ways of creating a
unique position. But all of them require a choice. All of them require
you to make trade-offs. You gonna do this but not that. You have to
deliberately choose not to serve certain customers, not to offer
certain features.

BW: In one of your articles you expounded on environmental aspect of
doing business. You mentioned resource productivity which many
companies apparently do not want to waste money on. But how do you view
the situation when one firm tackles sustainable development and the
other does not? Isn't this environmental thing supposed to be a
concerted effort? Won't an effort of one cancel out the other?

MP: I think what we believe from looking at many products and services
is that actually environmental improvements lead to greater efficiency
on the part of the company. Sometimes in the short term there is a
transition while the company is learning to do something a different
way. So, its cost may be higher in the short term. But in the long
term, less pollution usually needs lower cost. Because pollution is
waste. So, I believe that its just good business for companies to be
thinking about how to eliminate or reduce their emissions, and their
discharges and their dumping. Because if they do that, they will be
taking steps that will also improve the utilization of raw materials.
And make them more efficient. Now, there is an issue of one company
competing in an environmentally unsound way and not face any sanctions.
And another company is forced to meet certain standards. And there
being not a level playing field. I do think cases like that exist. But
what we found more and more is that the company that is being
environmentally unsound actually won't be successful in the long-run.
And even in developing countries, countries shouldn't delay the
introduction of environmental standards because they simply reinforce
the process of economic development. Just like karma, you get it in the
end.

BW: Aside from environment, what other issues should companies today
seriously consider in doing business, those they have been ignoring for
a long time?

MP: I think that companies in the Philippines need really developed
strategies. They've been opportunistic. They've been doing a lot of
deals. They've been moving in a lot of fields. They need clear
strategies we're talking of. Number two, I think it's gonna be
increasingly necessary for companies here to at least compete in the
region not just in the country. Thirdly, as I said in the seminar, it's
gonna be necessary to change the nature of the strategic alliances that
companies do. I think historically companies in countries like the
Philippines have relied too heavily on their foreign partners. They're
gonna have to move to develop more internal capability and better
technology. I also believe that almost every company that's diversified
probably is gonna need to get more focused. That, for me, are the big
four issues.

BW: Do you discourage alliance with foreign partners?

MP: I'm arguing that those alliances need to be shifting in their
character. They need to be more selective. They need to give the
Philippine company the opportunity to sell its own brand. In some
international markets, they need to create more room for Philippine
companies to start to move to more sophisticated strategies. Alliances
are still gonna be indispensable tools for bringing in technology,
bringing in skills, getting access to an international marketing. What
I'm really saying is that the alliances of five years ago are gonna
have to be changed.

BW: How do you view this situation wherein developing countries are
racing with much-developed economies and they are faced with prospect
of depleting much-abused resources. How do you strike a balance?

MP: Again, I believe that the process of successful economic
development requires the country to learn not to deplete its resources.
So, for example, one of the problems the Philippines has is in a
variety of industries, because of poor regulatory climate and so forth.
You're depleting assets like fishing grounds. That kind of strategy
don't support increasing economic development. What you need to do is
you need to have a regulatory environment that says no, you can't fish
anymore than the fishing stock will permit. And that's a sign the
country is getting more developed. It has policies and regulations that
encourage conservation and renewal of resources. And ensure the
resources are not wasted. The prices set for resources are
market-driven prices so companies don't waste them. In a lot of
countries, the countries give away mineral deposits or timber rights.
But that's a bad policy. If government owns the land they should be
setting prices for timber that are (raw) prices. And that forces the
company to learn how to be more efficient. I don't think its inevitable
that resource-depletion will occur with economic development. In fact,
I think that successful economic development demands that the country
learns how to avoid depleting resources.

BW: I just want to play devil's advocate. Don't you agree with Jurassic
Park where one of the characters - the scientist - said the earth can
take care of itself?

MP: I think the earth can take of itself only if... I think one can
create an environment and... where we humans do unnecessary damage. And
see, I think its good business to not deplete the earth's resources. I
think if we can just get intellectually, the right framework. And if we
can get governments to understand that there's actually quite a bright
future for the earth.

Housing funds released to banks

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) chief executive officer and
president Zorayda Amelia C. Alonzo announced recently the release of
funds to housing loan conduit banks and subdivision developers as part
of HDMF's initiative towards alleviating the country's housing backlog.

Speaking at the regular business meeting of the Subdivision and Housing
Developers Association (SHDA) at the Shangri-La Makati, Ms. Alonzo said
Pag-IBIG Fund has released P60 million since August 23 for housing loan
take-outs in the National Capital Region under the Unified Home Lending
Program (UHLP) window processing system.

She also said Pag-IBIG Fund, with resources of P40 billion as of end of
first semester 1996, is the primary financier of the national shelter
program.

In addition to the P5.4 billion released by Pag-IBIG Fund when it took
over mortgages not taken out by the National Home Mortgage Finance
Corporation (NHMFC) in 1995, Pag-IBIG Fund is committing P5 billion to
UHLP in 1996.

Pag-IBIG Fund's own lending window, the Expanded Home Lending Program
(EHLP), released P1.1 billion between January to July through housing
developers and banks.

Ms. Alonzo also said the SSS committed P5 billion for housing loans for
1996 under Pag-IBIG's lending windows. The Government Service Insurance
System committed another P5 billion.

Meanwhile, target low-income borrowers of socialized housing projects
may now apply for amortization support on their home loans under the
Abot-Kaya Pabahay Fund (AKPF) administered by the National Home
Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC).

During a recent Board of Director's meeting, NHMFC president Manual
Eduardo B. Lunas reported that, "cognizant of the realities of rising
land costs and escalating prices of housing construction, the
corporation has successfully secured the approval of the Housing and
Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) to amend the
qualification standards for availment of amortization subsidy under the
fund."

"To enable more low-income borrowers of social housing projects to
qualify for subsidy, the new AKPF guidelines provide for an increase in
the monthly gross family income cap by as much as 50%," Mr. Lunas added.

The AKPF amortization support component under Republic Act 6846 is a
two-tiered scheme which provides qualified borrowers a graduated
five-year support plan ranging from a high of 35% to a low of seven per
cent.

One of the requirements for availment is the monthly family gross
income of beneficiaries, now increased to P6,000 from P4,000 for Level
A and P7,000 from P5,000 for Level B.

New elevator technology reduces crowding

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. has announced the local availability
of the Schindler Miconic 10TM system, a revolutionary feature in its
Schindler 700 elevator series.

The Miconic 10TM allocates elevator cars to passengers according to
their destination before they even ride the car, thus reducing crowding
and confusion as elevator doors open.

"The Schindler 700 series of elevators is our premium line of elevators
for high-rise buildings. It was developed to ensure maximum efficiency,
comfort and aesthetic beauty to what will become architectural
landmarks," said Gus Haxton, Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. general
manager.

"Now the Miconic 10TM enhances the Schindler 700's performance by
telling passengers what elevator they should ride before they approach
the car."

The Miconic 10TM has a hall call control system. Passengers enter the
number of their destination floor on a keypad installed in the elevator
lobby. The system will then assign an elevator and display it on a
small screen.

The assignment is based on the passenger's known destination. Crowding
in the car and lobby is then avoided, as well as rushing to the nearest
elevator door that opens.

Mr. Haxton said, "This system also ensures lesser landing stops during
the journey because the elevator knows how many will be in the car and
where its occupants are headed. Passengers will then get to their
floors faster and more comfortably. Elevator availability increases and
journey times decrease even under heavy traffic conditions."

Real estate body to host regional symposium here

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Chamber of Real Estate and Builders' Association (CREBA) will host the
first ever regional symposium on "The Search for a Sustainable City for
the 21st Century" in Manila on October 16-19, 1996.

Techie Bautista, conference deputy director said, "In the main, the
quality of life in the cities of the 21st century is what the
conference is all about."

She added the conference is a private sector initiative which aims to
organize an industry-led movement to develop structural references for
an ecologically sustainable city for the next millennium.

New York University professor and CREBA consultant Rudy Cuba defines
sustainable city as a city "developed in ways that are socially just,
ecologically sustainable, politically participatory, economically
productive and culturally vibrant."

He also said the vision of a sustainable city is one that is integrated
with its natural surroundings and the province or region where it is
located.

"We are shedding the traditional concept of isolation. Instead, our
urban ecosystem is viewed as integral part and in concert with the
wider ecosystem," he said.

Gov"t bridge program faces delay

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

By Cecille E. Yap

With the rising number of politicians seeking to be accommodated, a
P1.3-billion government bridge program involving the construction of
207 pre-fabricated steel bridges nationwide, is facing delay.

A government source told BusinessWorld the final list of program
beneficiaries should have been finalized and approved by Malacanang
during the cabinet meeting Tuesday. However, the Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH) supposedly failed to submit its list of
to-be-constructed national bridges.

This is after several national and local officials approached DPWH and
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) clamoring for
the inclusion of several areas in the list of project beneficiaries.

DPWH and DILG were expecting Malacanang's approval of the list of
beneficiaries this month. It may be noted the P1.3-billion project is
to be financed by the United Kingdom which is expected to release the
project loan this September.

In August, UK ambassador to the Philippines Adrian Thorpe and Foreign
Affairs Secretary Siazon signed an agreement involving the first
tranche of the loan totalling P360 million.

Of the P1.3 billion total project cost, 80% or P1.03 billion will be
shouldered by the United Kingdom, 35% of which is deemed a grant to the
Philippine government.

The DILG is taking charge of 134 local bridges under the program while
the DPWH will oversee the construction and rehabilitation of some 73
national bridges. It may be noted the bridge program involves the
installation of some 8,000 meters of pre-fabricated steel bridges
nationwide. It will cover 12 regions and 34 provinces.

Materials for bridges will be procured from Mabey & Johnson Limited, a
steel bridge producer endorsed by the UK government.

Under the original project timetable, the construction of bridges
should be completed by September 1997. Each bridge will be put up
within two weeks.

Construction boom until 1998, says Philippine Constructors Association

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Players in the local construction industry expect the construction boom
in the country to continue until 1998.

In a statement, the Philippine Constructors Association, Inc. (PCA)
said local public and private construction will accelerate by an
average rate of 12.4% and 15% respectively, for the years 1996-1998.

This is in view of the government's expectation of an eight per cent
annual average growth in Gross National Product (GNP) during the same
period given increases in investments, exports and consumer-led
spending.

"There is a great demand for construction within the Asia-Pacific
region," said Rogelio M. Murga, PCA president.

"The heavier requirements for infrastructure investments to support the
region's growth is tremendous," he added.

He said government construction projects will account for 43% of total
construction demand in the 1996-1998 period.

The PCA president noted under the 1993-1998 Medium Term Philippine
Development Plan, the government's infrastructure program requirement
was placed at P594.7 billion.

Of the amount, 45% will go to energy, power and electrification; 31% to
transportation and 15% to water resources.

He also noted residential construction will dominate the private sector
in the coming years given the expected strong demand for affordable
housing.

In the urban centers, major projects such as Fort Bonifacio, Ortigas
Complex, and several projects in Makati are taking shape.

Business activity in urbanizing places such as Cebu, Davao, Baguio,
Subic, General Santos will also contribute to the sustained demand for
private buildings, he said.

The PCA is recognized by the government as the active voice of the
construction industry, and is often consulted by government on policy
matters.

Quezon City property values up by 100%

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

By Cecille E. Yap

Joining the rush of local government units providing for increases in
property assessment in their respective areas, the Quezon City council
passed recently Ordinance 357 which provides for as much as a 100% hike
in the fair market value of real estate in the city.

The increase is expected to pave the way for an increase in the city's
real property tax collections.

It may be noted Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code allows
local governments to revise property assessments by preparing a new
"schedule of fair market values" for different classes of real estate
in their respective areas.

Provided, however, the new schedule is enacted through an ordinance
passed by the city or municipal council.

Under the ordinance, the new schedule pertains to the fair market value
only of raw land. The city government has yet to formulate a new
schedule for property assessment which covers raw land as well as
improvements thereon.

"The Quezon City government is in need of funds to cover the cost of
the increasing basic and essential requirements for a rapidly growing
population and a highly accelerated urbanization," noted City Ordinance
357.

Under the ordinance, property assessments are expected to rise by 15%
in areas classified as residences and by as much as 40% in areas
falling under commercial and industrial classification.

Also, fair market value of real estate in residential areas is placed
at between P1,500 and P3,500 per square meter. Commercial areas,
meanwhile, is appraised between P4,000 and P6,000 per square meter.

Fair market value of real estate used for hotels and residential and
commercial condominiums is placed between P6,000 and P11,000 per square
meter, depending on the type.

Meanwhile, real estate used for restaurants, schools, funeral parlors,
gasoline stations, motels, gymnasiums and other recreational centers is
valued between P2,000 and P9,000 per square meter.

The ordinance noted the last time the Quezon City government undertook
a general revision of the schedule of real property assessment was in
1981. Thus, such assessment is now considered unrealistic and obsolete.

Data obtained from Quezon City Hall also showed revenue from real
property taxes increased by as much as 300% from 1994 to 1996.

In 1994, real property taxes collected totalled P267.6 million. In
1995, this rose to P665 million.

This year, the city council expects the tax collection to slightly drop
to P626 million due to lesser penalty collections.

Stork Group inks pact to make aircraft parts

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

Stork Group subsidiary Fokker Elmo has signed a contract with AVIC
(Aviation Industries of China) subsidiaries China Precision Engineering
Institute (CPEI) and China National Airborne Equipment Corporation
(CNAEC) to manufacture complex electrical wire harnesses for aircraft
for the benefit of both the Chinese and Western aviation industries.

The joint venture (60% Fokker Elmo shareholding), named Lang Fang
Fokker Corp., is also the basis for the development and manufacturing
of electrical systems for future Chinese aircraft programs, such as the
100-seat regioliner. Annual sales will grow to $50 million within five
years.

The contract was signed in the presence of many dignitaries in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People.

Fokker Elmo is part of the Fokker Aviation Group which was recently
acquired by the Stork Group of the Netherlands. In total, the Stork
Group employs over 20,000 people and has an annual turnover of $3

University of Asia and the Pacific set to expand course in advertising

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

By this time, everyone must have already heard about the University of
Asia and the Pacific (UA&P). From a think-tank conducting research in
economics and business, it set up a graduate school, and a liberal arts
college, all in just 25 years. More recently, people have been talking
about its unique program-graduating in just five years with a master's
degree.

The former Center for Research and Communication has kept true to its
old name. And just like its flagship, the Institute of Communication is
already setting its sails to establish the School of Communication
(SCM).

The Institute of Communication is just one of the many schools that the
University will set up. Right now, it offers undergraduate studies in
Communication focused on Advertising. Next year, it will already be
offering its five-year program in Advertising.

Surprisingly for a young program, barely six years old, the Institute
is already making a name for itself. Its faculty, for instance, is
composed mainly of notable practitioners from the industry. J.J.
Calero, CEO and chairman of J. Walter Thompson and Antonio Mercado,
chairman of Basic Advertising, have been teaching in the Institute for
almost two years now. Even today, more distinguished practitioners have
come to form part of the faculty. Some are CEOs and presidents of
multinational advertising agencies while others are entrepreneurs and
pioneers of their own agency. So students also learn to have that nose
for business and to value that skill of private enterprise.

The Institute believes in a theoretical and practical approach to
learning. That is why students are given a more first-hand and holistic
approach to education. In fact, the program's curriculum was patterned
after the International Advertising Association, the only global
partnership of advertisers, agencies, media and marketing
communications professionals. So the program is not only practical, but
also meets international standards.

Bankard launches double return promo

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

Bankard, Inc., the leading domestic credit card company and issuer of
Bankard One, the world's first installment smart card, offers its more
than 41,000 Bankard One cardholders the chance to win back twice the
amount of money they spent on their installment purchases using their
Bankard One through Bankard One's "Double Your Money Offer" raffle
promo.

With this promo, a Bankard One cardholder who purchases a television
set worth P10,000 will get the chance to win P20,000 in cash.
Cardholders who make their purchases during the "Double Your Money
Offer" promo period from July 1 to December 31 are automatically
included in the six monthly raffles plus the grand raffle draw. They
just have to use their cards and nothing else.

Three winners are picked in every monthly draw. On the last draw on
January 16, the grand winner will get P100,000 and the three winners
P20,000 each. Bankard One cardholders can win a total of seven times
which is equal to six monthly draws and the grand draw. However, they
cannot win more than once per month and of that amount, not more than
P100,000. All prizes are tax paid.

Individuals who do not yet own a Bankard One can apply for one, and if
approved, can start using their cards to qualify for the raffle draws.

The first and second monthly raffles took place last August 15 and
September 12. Succeeding draw dates are on October 10, November 14,
December 12 and January 16. To qualify for the raffle on October 10,
the cardholder will have to make his purchases not later than September
30. Cardholders who make purchases after September 30 qualify for the
November 14 draw, and so on for the remaining draws.

Cardholders who win in any of the raffle draws will still be eligible
to win in all the remaining draws. They do not have to make additional
purchases in order to qualify for the remaining draws if they already
won in the previous draws. All Bankard One cardholders are encouraged
to keep using their Bankard One cards, as the more they charge the more
money they get at double the amount if they win in any of the raffle
draws.

Philippine Press Institute-Philippine Geothermal, Inc in search of best
science stories

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

The 1996 Annual Science and Technology Journalism Awards shifts to high
gear as research activity intensifies and more journalists continue to
submit their published articles for evaluation and judging.

The awards program, sponsored by the Philippine Press Institute (PPI)
and Philippine Geothermal, Inc., (PGI), evaluates news and feature
articles on science and technology published between November 1995 and
October 1996.

Cash prizes amounting to P50,000, P30,000 and P20,000 will be awarded
to the first, second and third place winners, respectively. In
addition, P10,000 each will be given to the next five finalists.

The minimum standards set by the organizers are: the news story or
feature article - 500 words or more - must be about science and
technology in the Philippine setting and written by Filipino
journalists.

While the awards program has its own full-time research staff, the
organizers have set October 25 as the last day for journalists who wish
to send in their published work.

The articles may be forwarded to the Screening Committee Secretariat at
the PPI office, Unit 308 B.F. Condominium Bldg., A. Soriano corner
Solano Street, Intramuros, Manila.

Last year, more than 3,000 issues of 147 publications - composed of
national dailies, community newspapers and newsmagazines - were
screened. From this, a total of 1,486 stories on science and
technology, written by 424 authors, were subjected to a rigorous
evaluation and judging process.

FEATURE: Authorities rely on P70 lens to fight assault on the dollar

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Elisha R. Garcia

Have you ever looked at a dollar bill and wondered if it was fake?

Roughly 55% of the $360 billion currently in circulation is held by
people outside the United States, according to regional magazine Asia,
Inc. It said nearly $135 million worth of bogus bills were confiscated
outside the US in 1994, up from just $30 million two years earlier.

At the rate demand is rising as a result of increased consumerism and
globalization, don't be surprised if one of these bogus bills lands in
your hand one of these days.

"The sheer ubiquity of the US currency which has had essentially the
same size, color and configuration since 1929, makes it a primary
target for counterfeiters," Asia, Inc. reported. And the $100 bill,
which accounts for around 60% of the US currency in circulation, has
been the most frequently faked.

Color copiers, laser printers and high-tech graphics software make
banknotes easier to copy. Computer programs can be designed to generate
random or sequential serial numbers in the bills.

Growing concern over rampant counterfeiting prompted the US Federal
Reserve Bank to come out with new tamper-resistant bills, starting with
the $100 bill early this year.

In a brief on the new dollar bill, the Fed said "the noticeable change
in appearance of the dollar bill represents ongoing commitment to
protect the US currency."

Among the 14 features incorporated in the new design were an enlarged
off-center portrait of Benjamin Franklin, a polyester security thread
running through the paper, a translucent watermark, and inks that
change colors when viewed from different angles.

Despite these efforts, many say the US dollar bill continues to be
under threat.

In the Philippines, Bangko Sentral has launched an information
campaign. It holds training seminars for bank tellers, cashiers, branch
managers and even auditors, and promotes the use of simple, easy-to-use
instruments to check the authenticity of the dollar bills freely
entering the financial system.

Training sessions on basic information like the identification of
counterfeit money can last for a day, while sessions on the commonly
used modus operandi of counterfeiting and measures to counteract them
can last for a week, said Bangko Sentral bank officer Maja Gratia L.
Malic.

"We do not just provide training sessions to anybody interested. They
must have proper endorsement," Ms. Malic said.

"We are careful in giving out information as this may be passed on to
counterfeiters themselves... We request participants not to talk about
the finer details of their training," she explained.

In the training sessions, trainees are also taught how to use basic
instruments in detecting the authenticity of banknotes.

These include hand-held lens for examining fine prints and machines
with ultraviolet light which brings out the fluorescent parts of the
dollar bills.

"These are very easy to acquire and benefits outnumber the costs on the
part of the banks. There are also more advanced instruments available
to them which they can acquire at a higher cost," said Henry N. Eisma,
Bangko Sentral deputy director for cash.

An eyepiece or a simple lens costs around P70 while a desktop
ultraviolet light can be had at P300 a piece. On the other hand, a more
sophisticated machine may cost several thousands of pesos, Mr. Eisma
said.

Officials said there has been a substantial drop in the volume of
counterfeit money the central bank has retrieved.

In 1991, there were 5,920 pieces of counterfeit dollar bills estimated
to cost $583,266 that were accumulated, Bangko Sentral documents show.

Last year, the volume dwindled to 837 pieces worth $73,630. As of
August 1996, Bangko Sentral's cash department, soliciting the help of
the US Secret Service, accumulated 497 fake bills worth $39,000.

Requests to establish the authenticity of the bills usually come from
individuals, police authorities and owners of large establishments. The
central bank then issues a certificate verifying the authenticity of
the bills.

Among the establishments which regularly approach Bangko Sentral are
hotels, the Shoemart and Rustan's department store chains, duty-free
shops, the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corp., and Laguna-based
theme park Enchanted Kingdom, Mr. Eisma said.

PDCP Bank bares expansion plans

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Dulce J. Castillo

Fresh from its acquisition of First Philippine International Bank
(First Bank), PDCP Development Bank is targetting a net income of P155
million this year.

"We are working hard towards that direction and presently we are still
on target," bank president Carlos Torres recently told BusinessWorld.

Under the bank's expansion program, Mr. Toress said PDCP plans to have
a network of 80 branches by year-end. Its network grew to 76 from only
19 before the merger.

He said the bank is in the final stages of integrating the two banks'
physical infrastructures.

Late last year, PDCP Bank bought 90% of the assets and liabilities of
cash-strapped FirstBank in exchange for 33% of FirstBank's shares of
stock.

This, however, does not include FirstBank's the P390-million obligation
to Bangko Sentral which the central bank extended when the bank was hit
by heavy withdrawals about two years ago.

"The liabilities we assumed were just selected. There were certain
obligations to Bangko Sentral which we did not buy. I think, that has
been settled," Mr. Torres said.

FirstBank's debt is payable over 29 years. It has tapped Dutch-based
ING Bank which has arranged for a 28.5-year peso-denominated bond to
cover the debt.

PDCP Bank's shareholders include the Metro Pacific Corp. and
DEG-Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH.

MegaLink, ExpressNet to ink merger agreement

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Two of the country's top consortia of automated teller machines (ATM),
Bank of the Philippine Islands' (BPI) ExpressNet and MegaLink, have
formally agreed to link up their networks by first quarter of next year.

The consortia will sign a memorandum of agreement on Sept. 24,
according to a BPI statement released yesterday.

The move will enable more than six million cardholders from both
networks to carry out banking transactions in over 1,500 ATM networks
in Metro Manila and the provinces, the statement said.

Aside from BPI, members of ExpressNet are Banco de Oro, BPI Family
Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines
and Solidbank Corp.

Comprising MegaLink are Active Bank, Asian Banking Corp., Asiatrust
Bank, Banco Davao, Bank of Commerce, Bank of South East Asia, Capitol
Development Bank, Development Bank of the Philippines, Equitable
Banking Corp., Far East Bank and Trust Co., Insular Savings Bank,
International Exchange Bank, LBC Bank, PhilAm Savings Bank, Philippine
National Bank, Philippine Veterans Bank, Pilipinas Bank, Premiere
Development Bank, Prudential Bank, Queen City Development Bank, Traders
Royal Bank, Union Bank of the Philippines, United Coconut Planters
Bank, and Urban Bank.

MegaLink had earlier linked up with the country's third ATM network,
BancNet. The disparity between the computer systems of BancNet, which
uses a six-digit personal identification number (PIN), and ExpressNet
and MegaLink which both use a four-digit PIN, has been cited as a major
stumbling block in the possible merger of all three ATM consortia.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Not the same Friday

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Last Friday's party of the Money Market Association of the Philippines
(MART) wasn't the kind of Friday Club that became infamously known for
being a sleazy venue for traders at the height of the Bancap scam.
Soon-to-be MART member International Exchange Bank hosted the evening's
affair which filled the second floor of Vincent's San Mig at Jupiter
St. in Makati City. The crowd was typically yuppie, with traders
exchanging pleasantries about the yield curve, the peso and their
banks' portfolio. Spotted hobnobbing with traders were Bangko Sentral
treasurer Boy Edeza and Bureau of Treasury deputy treasurer Eduardo
Mendiola.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Inside job

A big universal bank recently found its hands full of mounting
complaints from its credit cardholders after a key officer in the
bank's card division left in a huff. Industry sources say it was
already too late in the game when the bank discovered the officer had
faked billing statements and had personally pocketed payments. Heads
consequently had to roll when management discovered the officer had
managed to pull off the caper single-handedly for five years. Charges
can't be filed against the officer who came out in clean and is now
living somewhere in the US probably getting a tan in a beach in
California.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Hatta as the new BTr chief?

Bangko Sentral's accounting and information technology managing
director Teresita Hatta is being seriously considered to take the post
of National Treasurer Caridad Valdehuesa who is due to step down from
her office this September 30. While Ms. Valdehuesa's resignation may be
welcome news to some, especially to her deputy for internal affairs who
is at the forefront of an ouster move against the Treasurer, a number
of bank treasury officers feel the no-nonsense Ms. Valdehuesa has done
a good job in the BTr. They say it's during her stint when the capital
market deepened with the issuance of longer-tenored bonds and the
computerization of government securities trading. Never mind if she's
in a tiff with monetary authorities once in a while.

BANK ACCOUNTS: "Publicly listed" bank kuno

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

People at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) must have discussed
some things in their stockholders' meeting that would pose a threat to
national security. Members of media and brokers went home in disgust
last Monday after they were barred from covering the RCBC meeting.
Stockholders' meetings are traditionally open to reporters and
analysts. "The instruction from management was that the stockholders'
meeting will be exclusively for stockholders because the venue is quite
small," Griselda Barrot, a lawyer with RCBC, was quoted in Bloomberg as
saying. Prior to the incident, the bank informed the Philippine Stock
Exchange (PSE) it plans to discuss a 10-fold hike in its authorized
capital to P8 billion. The meeting may have been held closed-door
because the bank is anticipating some shareholders to oppose a plan to
sell P2.5 billion of shares to the public to raise an additional P2
billion via a stock sale to current owners, an RCBC official told
BusinessWorld. In a disclosure yesterday to the PSE, the bank said the
plans have been approved by its board. The bank is controlled by the
family of Philippine Ambassador to Japan Alfonso Yuchengco.

Chefs on Parade opens today

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23

Chefs on Parade (COP) '96 is just one of three food related events
which will be held at the Philippine International Convention Center
(PICC) starting today until Sept. 21.

Being held concurrently are Hotelexpo '96, which is the 6th
International Trade Exhibition on Hotel and Restaurant Equipment, and
Bakexpo '96, the 3rd International Trade Exhibit on Equipment and
Supplies for the Bakery and Confection Industry.

Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor will lead the opening rites of the COP at
10 a.m. at the PICC Plenary Hall, followed by the opening rites of the
other two expositions at the PICC Reception Hall. She will be assisted
by the chairman of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of the
Philippines (HRAP) Larry Cruz, HRAP President Leo Prieto, Jr., COP '96
chairman Bobby Carpio, and Alexander Limjoco, the chairman of World
Exhibitions and Conventions, Inc., which organized Hotelexpo '96 and
Bakexpo '96.

For his part, Mr. Prieto said, "Chefs on Parade '96 is expected to
secure the country's place in the international culinary scene while
strengthening trade relations, exchanging cuisine, culinary products
and food service technology among APEC's 18-member economies."

Representatives from 70 local hotels and restaurants are expected to
participate in this year's COP, which is a culinary competition
organized by the HRAP. Also participating are students from Hotel and
Restaurant Administration and Hotel and Restaurant Management schools
in the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Now on its 21st year, COP
will gather at least 3,000 professionals in 1,000 entry line-up for 35
major competitions for professional and student categories. The
competitions will showcase the best talents in the varied ways of food
and drink preparation, from cold food to cocktail preparation, hot
dish, Filipino cuisine, cake decoration, wedding cakes, pastries, fruit
and vegetable carving, ice carving and butter sculptures, table setting
and menu folder competitions.

As the COP this year adopts the theme "A Salute to APEC," eight of the
competitions will carry the APEC theme.

One of the sponsors, Asia Brewery Inc., this year will be adding the
following competitions to the usual line-up of events: the Q-Shandy
Table Display/Butter Carving Contest (open to professionals in the food
service industry); on-the-spot cocktail mixing contests - The Most
Creative Q-Shandy Mix for COP '96 and The Most Creative Beer Mix for
COP '96 (open to professionals and students).

the Philippines, the US, Australia, Taiwan, Italy, Spain, Germany, and
other European countries. Admission to the trade exhibition is free.

During Bakexpo '96, the Philippine Federation of Bakers Associations,
Inc. will be conducting baking seminars, demonstrations and
consultations. Admission to the trade exhibit is also free.

The three events are expected to draw over 18,000 visitors this year.

Pickwick"s Capers: Something from China

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 24

As you all are reading this, I shall be enjoying myself wandering
around this year's Chefs on Parade, once again marvelling at the
intricate sculptures made from butter and chocolate. All of these are,
thankfully, in the traditional form of sculpture. One can actually know
what they are meant to be. We have yet to witness anyone attempting
modern art by welding together those frightful airline butter packs.

Of course, it is the active competitions that I enjoy. Watching any man
practicing an art that he has spent many years of his life in
perfecting is always a joy. Watching these chefs in action is actually
exciting. One wonder as to when one of our restaurants will emulate
that now proving popular in London aptly named "Chef's Table." As you
are all aware, London and some of its "top people" can display a
certain snobbishness, especially in restaurants. To be known by the
Patron and shown to the best table displays one's importance to the
rest of the world. The best table used to be the one in the corner or
by the window, where one could see and more importantly be seen by
everyone. That has all changed. To really be "in" one is now offered
the one and only table that is set up in the kitchen. Here, the chef
will recommend and personally prepare the food and have the correct
wines served. All the while, you and your guests can watch him in
action and receive his personal service. Nobody can see you, however,
but they all are aware that you are there. A lovely idea though, if one
can afford it as I understand the bill tends to match the meal. At
least at COP one can watch the chefs in action, even if only the judges
get to try the end result.

I read a rather amusing but true story this week about one amateur cook
who had a distressing experiencing. In 1987, a lady, a cottage dweller
in Dartmoor, Devon, popped some scones into the oven and completely
forgot about them.

An hour later, just as she was stepping into the bath, she suddenly
recalled them. Without even grabbing a towel, she dashed stark naked
into the kitchen and while gripping the oven handle, she heard a knock
on the back door. Being in the country, she knew that if it was the
baker and if she didn't answer, he would automatically let himself in
and put the bread on the table. In a panic, she nipped into the broom
cupboard.

Hiding in the darkness, she heard the latch click and footsteps
crossing the kitchen, whereupon the cupboard door was opened by the
gasman who had come to read the meter. "Oh," said the woman, "I was
expecting the baker." When she got out, the scones were burnt as well.

Some newspaper columnists have of late indulged in attacking
restaurants for their practice of charging the full 10% VAT on the
final account. Their argument is that the customer should only pay the
same as that remitted by the restaurant owner to the BIR, which is
approximately 6%. This is, of course, nonsense. The reason that the
patron is only remitting the 6% to the BIR is that he has already given
4% to his supplier. If he treated this 4% as a cost, we, the consumer,
would be considerably worse off. As a simple example to prove the
point, he pays the supplier P100 plus P10 VAT. He now adds his wages,
overheads and profit and sells this to us at P200 plus VAT. We have
paid him P20 in VAT. He deducts the P10 he has already given the
supplier and remits P10 to the BIR. Thus, the full P20 has been
remitted. His mark up is 100% on cost. Should he treat his total
supplier's invoice as cost, then his selling price to ourselves would
be P220 plus VAT. Instead of our total bill being P220 as under the
present system, it would now become P242. I suggest to all campaigners
that it is a subject best left alone.

Most columnists delight in starting rumors. Pickwick, however, delights
in ending them. For months, rumors have been flying that probably the
most famous and popular watering hole for both foreigners and Filipinos
alike was, after 15 years, about to close its doors. Indeed, part of
the rumors were true, that being that as so many other businesses in
Makati, the owners were being subjected to rapacious and unrealistic
demands for lease renewal. While the property market contains so much
heat, as is currently the case, we will witness many food and beverage
outlets closing their doors in the coming years, especially in the
Makati district. Property owners are failing to understand that
restaurant customers will only frequent an establishment if its prices
are considered reasonable. Thus, there is a ceiling to what can be
charged and still attract customers. There is a mathematical percentage
of gross turnover that is the maximum one can pay for the business to
remain viable. Demands in excess of this mean closure.

It is true that prolonged negotiations over the lease of this
establishment did put the business in danger of closure and thus no
further investment was made by the owners. This danger is not only now
over, but the establishment is now ensured of a further ten years
tenure. Regular customers may experience some inconvenience however as
some extensive refurbishment will be undertaken to bring it to the
standards demanded by today's market. A new general manager has been
appointed whose plans for both cuisine and entertainment are really
quite exciting. For those of us who have used the facilities for many
years, it has become part of our personal history and we can now be
assured of it remaining so. Thus endeth the rumor!

Well, the best made plans for mice and men so oft they go astray. Some
weeks ago, during the daytime, my driver had taken me through an area
near Cubao which seemingly contained a number of restaurants that
appeared could well be of interest. I have ventured to my good lady
wife that we should visit this area one evening to sample the offered
cuisine. Whether the gods are interfering with my plans, I know not. It
would seem, however, that every time we plan for this outing, the
heavens open and the earth is deluged with rain. Full knowing that the
ill-drained streets of this metropolis will provide the inevitable
floods that not only cause inconvenience but drain many hours from an
otherwise useful life, we thus become reluctant to undertake such a
journey. We are thus committed, until the dry season commences, to only
explore within striking distance of our home. As we have covered this
beat for well over a year, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
find an establishment at which we have not dined. It was a relief,
therefore, to find a relatively new restaurant right in the heart of
Greenbelt, albeit offering Chinese cuisine, that of South Villa.

South Villa is not only new, it is bright, very, very bright. The
lighting is almost intense and with large uncurtained windows on two
sides, is not an establishment to be considered for an intimate meal
with one's paramour, not as though Pickwick would indulge in such
activity, I hasten to add. The tables are well set, sparkling white
tablecloths, excellent linen and available condiments such as soy and
hot sauce available.

The menu is not extensive, but interesting. I am unable to tell you as
to the province of China from which the type of dishes emulate. It did
not appear to be Cantonese and definitely not that area that I can
never spell correctly but phonetically sounds like, "Says one." (That's
Szechuan. - Ed.) I did ask the Filipino waiter as to where the food was
from and he answered, "China." An observant young man, one would think.

The range of soups offered was indeed extensive. My good lady wife
selected her favorite Chicken and Corn soup. A good portion presented,
but what can one say about Chicken and Corn soup except I admonished
her for failing our readers in the face of such alternatives. As
Shakespeare might of said on a decidedly off day, "The soup was good."

I had decided on the Beef and Tomato soup and was very pleasantly
surprised. The liquid was thin, but tasty. Quarters of peeled, fresh
tomatoes were aplenty, amongst which were thin strips of very tender
beef. The whole was both tasty yet delicate, one of the better soups
that I have had for a long time. Very, very good.

As usual, for our main dishes, we, like all others, selected far too
much. The menu lists prices for three sizes. I had started to select
the "Medium" when the waiter politely suggested that for just the two
of us, the small would probably be sufficient. How correct he turned
out to be. The portion of the "Small" is indeed generous.

We ordered the Beef with Macadamia Nuts. A delightful combination that
also contained well prepared vegetables. I adore macadamias, as long as
someone else has opened them. During our sojourn in Australia, at one
place, we were staying, a tree was in the garden. We would collect the
nuts, but the shells are the toughest thing in nature. Normal
nutcrackers just snap, hammering them is dangerous as they shoot off,
unbroken at any angle. If you do succeed with the hammer, the nut tends
to also be smashed and mixed with bits of shell. The solution turned
out to be the vice in the garage.

I digress. The beef was tasty chunks and very tender. The nuts were
delicious and probably the hardest thing that I have ever attempted to
pick up with chopsticks.

We had ordered the rice Fookien style. I would suggest that if you are
accompanied by a lady from the general area of Pampanga, as I was, with
my good lady wife, then you order this by pointing it on the menu. A
look of absolute shock came over her face as she misinterpreted my
words. (Only Filipinos with a knowledge of filthy language will
understand this comment.) The rice, which is what we would refer to as
fried rice, was particularly good and tasty. Good texture and moist,
with various vegetables finely chopped. For me, the good thing about
this was that it was also served in individual bowls. This allowed me
the luxury of spooning the beef dish on top, thus not only enjoying the
dish but even adding more flavor to the rice.

We had ordered Seafood Rolls, and again, be warned, the "Small" portion
contains eight quite large pieces. The rolls have a crispy, deep-fried
cover. Inside, they contain chopped squid and shrimp, with some finely
chopped carrot and probably celery. Unfortunately, they have also
included mayonnaise, a sauce of which I am not particularly fond, whose
creaminess overwhelms the seafood flavor. A dish of mayonnaise is
provided as an extra dip. Our American cousins, who tend to have a
penchant for this type of dressing, would probably enjoy them, but they
are not for me, nor even my good lady wife.

We had also requested the roast pigeon. A pigeon chopped into quarters
was delivered with crisp noodles. A rich dark meat which I enjoy. I
feel a little revenge when eating pigeon, revenge against all of that
breed of bird that has throughout my life indicated that they would
like to purchase my motor vehicle. Well, they at least leave a deposit
on it and it is there in black and white. My good lady wife found the
meat very tough. I thoughtfully informed her that in England pigeons
were allowed to hang in the garden until it was maggot-ridden and this
made the meat very tender. She, with an unusually pale face asked how
one removed the maggots. Upon being informed that one didn't bother as
they had been consuming the meat and therefore tasted the same, she
decided upon a visit to the comfort room. Being married to me has
decidedly improved her general knowledge.

I had consumed two glasses of the Paul Masson Chablis wine during the
meal, which was not that bad at all. It definitely goes well with
Chinese cuisine.

While I indulged in Chinese tea, my good lady wife tasted the Mango
Puree which she declared delicious. To the delight of our driver, the
fairly good portion of the meal that we had failed to consume was
packed for takeaway and we paid our bill of just over P1,500. Very good
value.

Overall, we had a pleasant meal served by polite and friendly staff. To
be fair to other cuisines though, Chinese can really never be described
as fine dining, so an award of two top hats is a reasonable assessment.

Quezon City"s little secret

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23

By Vladimir S. Bunoan

Although it boasts of a popular restaurant row in Tomas Morato Avenue,
home of several old-time favorites like Mario's and Alfredo's Steak
House, Quezon City doesn't enjoy the same reputation as Makati - and
now the Ortigas Center - when it comes to fine dining.

Its restaurants, although doing great business among the many residents
in this part of the town, are generally old-fashioned, which means
having menus filled with such classic Filipino fine dining staples as
steaks and Caesar Salad. Generally, restaurants in Makati are more
adventurous when it comes to their menus, and with the growing
sophistication of Filipino diners, many establishments in Quezon City
seem dated.

But there is one restaurant in Quezon City that is breaking all the
preconceived notions about eateries north of Makati. Established less
than a year ago, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs has proven that the Quezon
City crowd is just as discriminating as the expense-account foodies of
Makati.

While positive word-of-mouth has tempted diners from as far away as
Antipolo and Alabang to check out the restaurant, this
deli-cum-restaurant has built a loyal following among those who either
live or work in Quezon City, including celebrities like Pops Fernandez,
Ogie Alcasid, and Gelli de Belen, who proudly calls it her "secret
little place."

Increasingly, however, more and more are let in on this secret. Food
critics like Doreen Fernandez have been generous with praise and are
personally recommending it to their friends. In the latest edition of
the Fodor's Guide to Manila, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs made it to the
list of restaurants for tourists to try.

That the restaurant is not located on a major street (it sits off
Balete Drive, on Lantana Street corner Boston, almost right across the
Boston Gallery) makes its success even more noteworthy. In a business
where "location, location, location" is considered a mantra, Blue Bacon
and Green Eggs seems to be more attuned to the "If you build it, they
will come" school of thought.

For owner Mike Prado, that seems to be an apt motto. A businessman who
made his fortune in exporting furniture and home accessories, Mr. Prado
believes that his entry into the food business is providential.

A member of the Catholic Charismatic Movement, Mr. Prado noticed that
his exports were not doing as well as before, and in fact seemed to be
on the decline. At the point, he prayed and asked God if he should
start looking at other businesses.

Mr. Prado had dabbled in businesses other than exports. He once
produced a musical called By George!, a musical tribute to American
composer George Gershwin, which was directed by his good friend, Behn
Cervantes. It was staged at the Metropolitan Theater in 1991. Although
he said he didn't lose money on that venture, he feels the theater
scene then didn't have the momentum it seems to be enjoying these days.

Mr. Prado admits that his biggest dream was to one day open a
restaurant. His friends attest to his skills in entertaining guests at
his home. He had the interest although he candidly admits that he
didn't know a thing about opening and running a restaurant.

He was asking for a sign from God, although the idea of putting up a
restaurant had become increasingly tempting. He knew that the sign
would be in the form of flowers, and one day a nun gave him a bouquet
of white roses for the little chapel within his residential compound.
He knew this was the sign he was waiting for ("Let's face it, a man
doesn't get flowers," he said). Immediately, he called up his architect
and had the restaurant built.

Everything, he said, just fell into place, as if indeed it was being
guided by a greater power. He had no problems in staffing, the supplier
for the delicatessen even agreed to give a two-week seminar for the
employees, and he got chefs who were trained in Le Souffle. ("I didn't
pirate them," he stressed.)

Sans the usual publicity blitz that accompanies restaurant openings,
satisfied customers spread the word and quickly the restaurant with the
funny name and the unusual location became a surprise hit. From a small
30-seater restaurant inside the deli, it has since been expanded to
accommodate around 100 guests, scattered in three areas. The original
dining area beside the deli, an al fresco garden setting with views of
lush greenery and a small waterfall (also the smoking area), and
another air-conditioned area, which was rushed to accommodate the
volume of Valentine's Day reservations.

(About the name, he explained he didn't know of the Dr. Seuss book,
Green Eggs and Ham, until after he opened the restaurant, and denied
that he is affiliated with La Salle and Ateneo. "Bacon and Eggs" was
already decided on, but he literally added more color to the way it
sound.)

Mr. Prado believes there are two important elements in the restaurant's
success - creativity and consistency. As the restaurant is connected to
a deli, the chefs have more ingredients to play around with. For
instance, Mr. Prado is proud that his is the only one in Quezon City
that offers goose liver (done pan-fried with scallops and served with
goat cheese, Parma ham, lettuce and Madeira dressing). A new addition
to the menu is Penne al Gorgonzola, a pasta dish flavored with the
strong Gorgonzola cheese plus Parmesan, with strips of garlic Italian
sausage, sundried tomatoes and fresh cream.

The menu is quite extensive, offering the usual deli sandwiches and
cold cuts, a long list of pasta dishes, and chef's specialties, plus a
variety of desserts, imported beer, souffles and coffee.

Mr. Prado, whose office is just next door to the restaurant, is now
making sure of the consistency. He is aware that the usual pitfall of
restaurant owners is expanding too fast, and he is careful not to be
tempted by this success.

He states confidently that he will continue with his export business,
which has since rebounded, thus calming the fears of his export clients
that he has not turned into a full-time restaurateur. He is, in fact,
planning to put up an IKEA-style furniture shop to cater to new
homeowners.

He is also thinking of converting another section of his compound into
a ballroom for shows and family-style entertainment.

Who says you can't have the best of both worlds?
