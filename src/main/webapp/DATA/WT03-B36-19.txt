The Changing Climate of Collaboration

     One dividend of our exploration of space has been that
series of photographs of earthrise over the moon -- of our
blue-green planet, fragile and entire in space.  As part of its
copyrighted series of op-ed ad pieces in the New York Times and
Wall Street Journal, Mobil Corporation (MOB-NYSE) last month
invoked the earthrise image to call for a new era of
collaboration between the camps of business and environmentalism.
Mobil says business "gets the picture."  That we are indeed all
in it together on spaceship earth and that changing times have
brought business to an understanding of environmental
responsiveness and activism.
     Mobil isn't alone.  A rising tide of collaborative studies,
initiatives, and projects large and small indicate a trend away
from confrontation and toward cooperation.
     Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the US Environmental Defense
Fund (EDF), told BATE "After twenty years of litigating, we're
finding that the carrot of improved profits is as compelling as
the stick of legal action."  And, true to that promise, EDF is
working with McDonald's Corp. (MCD-NYSE) in a major study to find
ways to reduce, reuse, recycle, and compost the solid waste from
the 11,000 McDonald's around the world.
     The EDF-McDonald's joint task force, a first between a major
environmental group and leading fast food retailer, will spend
six months looking at every step in McDonald's business.  The
joint announcement lists redesign and reduction in use of
packaging and shipping materials, increased use of materials with
less environmental impact, increased recycling and use of
recyclable packaging, composting of organic wastes, increased use
of reuseables shipping containers and foodware, and increased use
of recycled materials as possible areas of examination.
     The consultancy is distinctive because of the potential
leverage from its findings and the nature of the relationship.
In addition to the 11,000 McDonald's stores, there are another
130,000 fast food outlets and 330,000 restaurants in total in the
U.S. that stand to gain  from what is learned.  And every day,
McDonald's serves 22 million customers.   That's 22 million
chances every day to implant an environmental responsibility
message in the public mind.
     The agreement is carefully structured.  The study will be
made public and the feasibility of the recommendations assessed.
McDonald's says that, where feasible, they will implement the
recommendations.  If EDF and the hamburger maker disagree
materially, each has the right to issue a dissenting or separate
opinion.  Either party can end the project if no agreement looks
possible, and each is paying its own share to ensure
independence.
     So . . . within a week of one another, we have US$50 billion
Mobil saying "We don't see two camps.  Energies that ought to be
joined in collaborative efforts are far less productively
employed when slinging gibes or lawsuits.  When we work in tandem
-- or at least pull in the same direction -- a lot gets done."
And we have Fred Krupp, executive director of EDF, saying his
organization is "hopeful that this process (with McDonald's) will
illustrate ways in which business and environmental groups that
have significantly different perspectives can nevertheless work
together to achieve environmental improvements that are in the
public interest."
     Mobil's public call for conciliation and the EDF-McDonald's
venture are both discrete news events and points in a growing
trend.

Changing the Minds of Utility Regulators

     Other examples of corporation-environmental organization
collaboration are beginning to produce measurable results.  In
the summer of 1988, the US Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) and
New England Electric (NES-NYSE) agreed to work cooperatively on
conservation and load management programs and the attendant
regulatory and rate adjustments in the face of reduced sales.
     The transition from an adversarial to a cooperative
relationship has had an appreciable impact.  Armond Cohen, a
senior attorney on the CLF staff told BATE that in 1990, "New
England Electric will spend US$56 million on conservation,
exclusive of load management.  Over the life of that investment,
the NES outlay will yield savings to customers of $154 million in
current dollars."  Cohen reports that of the net $98 million pool
of savings, $80 million will be returned to the ratepayers, $10
million will cover costs, and $8 million will be returned to the
shareholders -- a .5% addition to the stockholders' return on
equity.  Cohen calls that an "attractive incentive to encourage
continued investment in conservation.  And," the Boston lawyer
continues, "those numbers don't reflect the reduced societal
costs of fewer dirty windows, less air pollution, fewer
respiratory problems."
     In 1991, says Cohen, the utility's conservation investment
will jump to $80 million, with $180 million in resulting savings
over the life of the investment.  The success of the CLF-NES
collaboration, particularly with state regulatory commissions,
has now been extended to 12 retail electric companies in New
England and New York and the development of a national
electricity conservation program for Jamaica.  $40 million was
invested across New England in conservation in 1987.  That figure
jumps to $200 million for this year, in part the result of the
initiative between New England Electric and CLF.  And the
investment will rise to $250 million in 1991.  The result?  In
what Cohen calls a conservative estimate, one third of otherwise
needed power plants in the region out to the year 2010 won't have
to be built, freeing that capital for other uses.
     At the National Audubon Society, Senior Scientist Jan Beyea
reminds that the Coalition of Northeast Governors (CONEG) has
brought together representatives of environmental organizations,
the various states' agencies and most importantly, 12 corporate
members in an extended collaborative effort to hammer out
standards and definitions of environmental terms -- leading to an
environmental seal for consumers.  In addition to his CONEG
participation, Beyea says he is often consulted informally by
corporations seeking Audubon's advice or opinion on new packaging
or product introductions.

European, Pacific Examples Surfacing

     While BATE's sources in Europe and Australasia all concede
that they are not aware of collaborative examples as remarkable
as the lion and lamb union of McDonald's and EDF, new initiatives
are surfacing.  In the United Kingdom, 30 non-government
environmental organizations have formed a coalition to foster
co-operation and environmental advocacy.  The Environment Council
calls its Business and Environment Programme "a major element" of
its work.  Steve Robinson, Chief Executive of the Environment
Council, numbers more than 300 corporations on the program's
membership rolls.  In an interview, Robinson told BATE the aim of
the Business and Environment Programme is "to promote the concept
that environmental sense is commercial sense."
     Robinson cites a recent exercise with 3M U.K. PLC during
which "50 environmental practitioners from our member
organizations sat down with 3M to talk about the benefits of a
complete corporate environmental policy -- how to prepare,
formulate, and most important, implement a company-wide
environmental policy.  As a result," said Robinson, "3M has just
adopted and made public a comprehensive environmental policy."
     On the Pacific Rim, Phil Noyce of Australia's Commission for
the Future (and soon to head Greenhouse Action Australia) advises
that his agency has been advising the international accounting
and management firm of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu on a potential
expansion from financial to environmental auditing.
     David Stephenson, an environmental strategist and senior
counsel at the Boston marketing communications firm of Agnew,
Carter, McCarthy, sees more strategic collaborative alliances
ahead.  "There are probably thousands of saplings out there this
summer dying from neglect.  They were planted by companies who
wanted or needed an Earth Day press release, and then forgotten."
McCarthy thinks one-shot environmental gestures are fading.  As
senior managers incorporate environmental considerations into
every step of planning, budgeting, producing, and selling, the
expertise and experience of environmental groups will offer an
attractive opportunity for synergy.  Measurable new profits and
immeasurable public benefits can result.

European Environmental Venture Fund Reaches First Round Funding
Goal; Will Make Commitments By Year's End

     A European venture capital fund based in the United Kingdom
has exceeded its first round funding goal and is already in due
diligence on a variety of startups aimed at solving European
environmental problems.  The fund, the first of its kind in
Europe, is called the TR ECOTEC Environmental Fund.  The venture
fund is a limited partnership combining the skills of Touche,
Remnant & Co. in London and ECOTEC Investment Service Limited of
Birmingham.  ECOTEC is an independent corporate strategy,
economics, and marketing group specializing in the environmental
protection and waste management industry.  Touche, Remnant's
specialist technology investment team is seven years old and has
some 190 million pounds under management.
     The fund's objective is to secure high total returns through
capital growth, by investment in emerging companies engaged in
the environmental protection and waste management industry in all
of Europe.
     Richard Haines, Director of ECOTEC, told BATE the fund has
16 million pounds in hand, 1 million pounds more than their
interim goal.  "Within two years, we seek to have raised 30
million pounds," said Haines.  The fund is an unrecognized
collective investment scheme under the UK's Financial Services
Act.  Which means investment by private individuals is
prohibited.  Haines says "pension funds and blue chip
corporations predominate among the subscribing institutional
investors."
     Asked to characterize the proposals the fund has gotten so
far, Haines called them "all over the lot as to technology,
strategy, and polish -- as you might expect.  The greatest number
are water and waste water treatment schemes, tertiary processes
in membranes and other advanced filtration processes where the
technology is just emerging.  Next in quantity," Haines
continued, "are the land remediation companies.  And we're seeing
a lot of joint ventures between Northern European and US
companies on the one hand and Southern European companies on the
other.  An example is proposal by a Danish air pollution
management company and a Spanish engineering firm for a joint
venture in Spain."
     No investments have yet been made, but, says Haines, "We're
down to a dozen or so in due diligence and we expect to make two
commitments by the end of the year."

Internal, External Forces Affect Earnings at Big Waste
Collectors

     The New York-based Value Line investment service ranks the
US environmental companies first among 97 sectors for relative
share price performance over the next 12 months.  In an era of
rising environmental awareness and expectation, these growing
companies can count on continued public and private scrutiny --
on operations and on stock performance.
     Houston-based Browning Ferris Inc. (BFI-NYSE) posted third
quarter sales of US$767.562 million and operating income of
$82.378 million, up 18.5% and 8.8% respectively over the similar
period last year.  Analysts said BFI had reduced the out-of state
waste it accepted at its big Ohio landfill to appease regulators.
Diminished volume there and eroding margins as competition
heightens abroad accounted for results below expectation.
     For Waste Management Inc. (WMX-NYSE), it wasn't the second
quarter results -- earnings up 26%, to $178.872 million -- but
rather how an article in Barron's looked at Waste Management's
accounting that created ripples.  An article by Abraham Briloff
cites the booking of a non-taxable gain of $70.8 million
resulting from the unrealized appreciation of shares of its
Chemical Waste Management after Chemical's initial public
offering as an example of "liberal accounting."
     Rollins Environmental Services (REN-NYSE) saw quarterly net
go from red to black ink as the Wilmington, Delaware company saw
big new incinerators begin to operate at close to capacity.
Rollins netted $7,224,000 on $52,486,000 for the quarter ended 30
June.  That compares to a loss of $33.5 million on sales of $39.
6 million for the comparable quarter in 1989.  Rollins is on
target for a $200 million year with earnings of $19.179 million
on sales of $146.492 million for the first three quarters of its
fiscal year.
     The addition of used oil recycling and waste fluid recovery
to Safety-Kleen's (SK-NYSE) core business of automotive and
industrial parts and tool cleaning is producing steady gains.
From Elgin, Illinois, Safety-Kleen reports second quarter
earnings of $11,995 million -- 15% better than the same period
last year.  Sales were $132.885 million for the quarter and
$258.488 for the first six months of 1990.  Net earnings rose
from 31 cents to 35 cents per share quarter to quarter over '89.
     Chemical Waste Management (CHW-NYSE), 78% of which is still
held by Waste Management, added four cents to its per-share
earnings for its second quarter.  The largest of the US hazardous
waste handlers booked earnings of $43.081 million on revenues of
$270.446 million for the period ended 30 June, lifting earnings
from 17 cents to 21 cents per share over 1989.

Regulatory Uncertainty Whipsaws a New Public Company

     Even after the worldwide dip in equity markets brought on by
the Iraqi crisis, U.S. shares of pure environmental companies are
performing better than other sectors.  Of five environmental
companies that have gone public this year, four are trading above
their IPO prices.  The shares of Mid-American Waste Systems Inc.
(MAWS-OTC), Environmental Elements Corp. (NLCO-OTC), Sanifill
Inc. (FIL-AMEX), and Tetra Technologies (TTRA-OTC) are all
showing gains.  Sanifill, which closed at US$25 as we went to
press, was offered in April at $9.50, up over 150%.
     The laggard is Horsehead Resource Development Company
(HHRD-OTC) whose experience underscores the changing, expanding
regulatory climate facing environmental remediation companies and
the need for investors and businesses to be both nimble and
diligent.  Horsehead, offered at $14.50 a share in July, rose to
$22, but closed as we went to press at $13.75.  The company
recovers zinc in steel mills in western Pennsylvania that recover
steel from scrap metal.  Horsehead resells the zinc and also
recovers lead and cadmium from the steelmaking dust and sells
that to other processors.  The recycling produces a slag and the
slag is the problem.  The US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) doesn't regulate the slag, and indeed the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation is a Horsehead client and uses the
slag on icy roads.  Because the process isn't regulated, the
costs are low compared to regulated landfills and other waste
treatment and recovery operators.
     The trace lead, cadmium, and chromium in the slag has
produced an unusual alliance.  Environmental groups and the
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, the waste treatment operators,
have joined to challenge the EPA to regulate the slag.  A federal
district appeals court in Washington, D.C. said last month that
the EPA does indeed have the power to regulate the slag and asked
that it begin to do so.
     Only in its final offering document did Horsehead mention
the federal court case, saying even then that the ruling was
immaterial.  Horsehead contends that its recovery technology is
the industry standard and that the EPA accepted that notion.
     The company is at work on a process to use the slag to
reclaim more heavy metals from waste water, but the regulatory
pressure is there.  Reports on all these developments by Debra
Coy, an analyst for County NatWest subsidiary Washington Analysis
Corp. and the volatile price of zinc have combined with market
volatility to move Horsehead's shares lower.

Taxes on Carbon Proposed on Two Continents

     Businesses operating in the European Community may soon be
subject to a carbon tax.  The notion is part of a position paper
on potential economic and fiscal instruments of EC environmental
policy.  Action may come as soon as next month.  The paper calls
greenhouse gases "one of the most pressing problems of the energy
sector."  The carbon tax would be based on the amount of carbon
dioxide produced by each kind of fuel.  And presumably would
reduce greenhouse emissions by increasing efficiency and spurring
conservation and non-carbon based alternative energy research.
Depending on the array of conservation measures and energy
performance standards for buildings and appliances, a carbon tax
could increase fossil fuel prices by 20-30%
     The ideas raised in the EC paper will be on the agenda of an
informal meeting of EC environmental ministers in Rome next month
and may be acted on in formal session in October.
     The carbon tax idea is surfacing on the other side of the
Atlantic as well.  In an op-ed piece in the New York Times on
August 6, David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council
and Alan Miller of the University of Maryland's Center for Global
Change, the authors urge President Bush to adopt a carbon tax,
saying the measure "would yield billions while sharply reducing
greenhouse emissions."

EPA Announces Stringent Sulfur Reduction Rule for Diesel Fuel

     In 1988 US petroleum refiners and diesel engine
manufacturers prepared a joint proposal to the EPA for on-highway
diesel fuel modification.  That landmark collaboration is the
basis for an EPA measure to reduce sulfur by 80% in diesel fuel.
Earlier rules resulting from the industry initiative limit heavy
duty particulates.  This new standard, to be met by 1 October
1993, reduces sulfur content of diesel fuel from 0.25 percent to
0.05 percent by weight.
     The rule will add as much as 2.3 cents per gallon to diesel
prices.  The EPA estimates annual costs to refiners between
US$380 and $910 million in 1995, and as much as $1.3 billion by
2010.  The measure will reduce the cost of emissions control
devices, saving buyers $60 to $325 per vehicle.  Fuel savings
from the newer more efficient catalytic technology will amount to
$200 million in 1995 and $465 million in 2010.  The measure may
cut engine wear, bringing the direct economic benefit above the
increased cost per gallon.  Nevertheless, expect the fuel
increases to be passed on by transit authorities and every
shipper using diesel trucks to virtually all of the nation's
commuters and consumers.
     The US measure is projected to reduce sulfate particulates
by 196,000 tons by 1995 and reduce sulfur dioxide levels by
580,000 tons annually.  Sulfur dioxide further oxidizes in the
atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfates,
components of acid rain.
     European pressure to match the US standards has prompted a
cost study by CONCAWE , a consortium of 36 petroleum companies
controlling 90% of Western European refining capacity.  CONCAWE
finds, depending on diesel demand and the availability of low
sulfur crude, that to produce 0.05% sulfur content diesel fuel,
the 12 EC countries could expect to make an additional capital
expenditure of between US$3 billion and $4.3 billion; that the
cost per ton of sulfur removed would range between $6,000 and
$9,000; and that the total manufacturing costs would reach to
between $12 and $18 per ton of diesel fuel.  (These are metric
tons, which equal 1.102 US tons.)
     For more information on the EPA rulemaking, the contact is
Martha Casey at +1 202 382 4378.  Information on the CONCAWE
study can be gotten from Denis Lyons, CONCAWE, Madauplein 1,

Superfund Changes Put EPA (and Taxpayers) Between Banks and
Environmental Groups

     The US Superfund is a two-pronged federal tool to clean up
toxic sites.  The law sets a standard of liability for those who
pollute that is strict, joint, and federal.  That means a person
or corporation can be liable regardless of fault, and that the
government can go after cleanup costs from any one defendant.
The other prong is the pool of money, Superfund itself.  Those
dollars can be used to clean orphan sites where those
responsible cannot or will not pay.
     Although Superfund can cast a wide net, lenders have
typically been protected from the law's reach.  Merely holding
collateral or other security interest, typically a mortgage, in a
contaminated property will not set off Superfund liability.
     In return for this protection, banks and savings and loan
institutions are obliged to exercise due diligence in evaluating
environmental risks as part of their lending.  That has soured
some deals, but more importantly produced heightened awareness
and environmental protection, possibly staving off some future
Superfund sites.  In the Senate, S.2827 exempts lenders "from any
law imposing strict liability for the release . . . of hazardous
substances from property (1) acquired through foreclosure; held
in fiduciary capacity; or (3) held, controlled, or managed
pursuant to the terms of an extension of credit."
     That, says William J. Rogers of the Environmental Defense
Fund, guts Superfund's powers and preempts state laws.  Lenders,
the environmental groups testify, will look the other way,
avoiding the diligence current law mandates.  A similar bill,
with 273 co-sponsors, awaits the House Transportation and
Hazardous Waste subcommittee when Congress returns.
     Bankers, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and the
Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) all say they need the safe haven of
the new law's protection.  FDIC chairman William Seidman told the
Senate panel pollution liability is a major impediment to
government sale of properties acquired in the S&L bailout, with
the delay raising costs to taxpayers.   The EPA has recently said
that the banks and federal agencies have legitimate concerns.
And taxpayers, in framing advocacy, must decide whether they wish
to pay higher taxes for more Superfund relief or higher taxes for
increased costs in the S&L bailout.  The economics will be
thrashed out in September when the Congress reconvenes.

California Firm Ready for Expanded Pollution Rights Sales, But
Some Companies Won't Sell

     On the list of market-based incentives against acid rain,
one of the wildest is pollution rights.  The US EPA has
established a practice of creating and granting rights to pollute
the air.  Robert Beck of the Edison Electric Institute in
Washington, DC told BATE power plants are assigned a fixed number
of allowances.  "Allowance" in this case means a ton of sulfur
dioxide that the plant is allowed to emit annually.  "They're
assets," says Beck.  "Companies can lease them, trade them, buy
and sell them.  They can only be used forward in time and they're
recognized on a calendar year."
     Markets crave efficiency; pollution rights are no different.
Enter AER*X,  a pollution rights brokerage firm in Los Angeles,
the brain child of John Palmisano, who started the system while
he worked for the EPA.
     AER*X has just been sold by WPL Holdings to NaTec Resources
(NATC-OTC), which in turn is 44.8% held by CRSS Inc. (CRX-NYSE).
The $1.4 million company may benefit from expanded pollution
rights in the clean air bill that will move out of conference
when the US Congress returns in the fall.
     But there are uncertainties.  Tom Zosel, manager of
pollution prevention at Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing
(MMM-NYSE), cautions that "the EPA is tightening its market
mechanisms in non-attainment areas.  Companies that use the
credits are essentially going forward and modifying as they go.
For a time, the EPA was making policy in response to specific
instances, so the initiators were ahead of the curve . . . but
everyone learned to live with a high degree of ambiguity."
     Zosel reports that 3M is no longer selling emission credits,
but is buying.  "3M has spent $160 million to implement
substantial emissions reductions.  If we turn around and sell the
rights to what we've gained, we've done nothing for the
environment.  We're keeping the rights for future growth or to
return to state and local agencies as improvement in air
quality."

Regional Center Will Build Foundations for Environmental Action
in Central and Eastern Europe

     That the governments of Eastern Europe did not provide clean
air and clean water contributed in part to their overthrow.  Now,
as these new governments move away from command economies, they
are inundated by sellers of environmental remedies.  Because the
problems are so large, so are the opportunities to profit.
     One international initiative on the environment that stands
to rationalize the process is the Regional Environmental Center
for Central and Eastern Europe in Budapest.  The center's charter
was signed earlier this summer by the US, The Netherlands,
Hungary, and the European Community.  Other nations in the region
are expected to sign on.
     The Center will operate as an independent, not-for-profit
non-governmental organization under a 15-member international
board.  BATE asked Helen Petrauskas, vice president for
Environment and Safety Engineering at Ford Motor Company and one
of three US board members, where the board will begin.
     "We're starting from scratch," said the Ford executive,
"defining the kinds of institutions and the level of democratic
participation.  You must remember those nations must draft whole
new sets of environmental laws and create and staff environmental
ministries."
     "I hope we can create a credible neutral meeting place for
government, industry, and the environmental NGOs to come
together," Ms. Petrauskas continued.
     The Center's charter calls for work in four areas:
collection and dissemination of data; development of
institutions; education; and matching available resources with
regional needs -- a clearing house.  Asked whether this function
could be viewed as a trade mission, Ms. Petrauskas said, "There's
no doubt we're in the role of exporting economic expertise,
getting help on what's worth buying.  Poland, for instance is
besieged by environmental vendors and is trying to sort out the
claims.  But we have to be careful not to assume our way is the
best way."  Asked what she meant, Ms. Petrauskas said that a
regional model similar to the European community might offer the
best solutions.
     Philip Warburg, director of the Central and East European
Environmental Program for the Environmental Law Institute in
Washington, DC, echoed Ms. Petrauskas's observations. "First,
credible environmental protection regimes must be put in place,
and that raises issues of appropriate public involvement, the
public right of access to information, citizen suits, and the
role of the judiciary."
     Warburg cautioned environmental businesses that would go to
the region to be aware of "considerable differences in
receptivity in different countries.  Where the Hungarians are
entrepreneurial, Czechoslovakia, for instance, is emanating a
certain ambivalence to industrial perspectives.  In their vision,
they don't feel the need for a carbon copy of western values.
But," continues Warburg, "that skepticism shouldn't be penalized,
but understood."
     In succeeding issues, BATE will look at the public and
private initiatives under way in the region, identifying what and
who is working and why.  The US contact for the regional center
is Stephen Wassersug, the newly appointed program director.  His
phone number at the EPA office in Philadelphia is +1 215 597
8131.  In Budapest, the contact is Peter Hardi, Executive
Director, Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern
Europe, Budapest III, Miklos Ter 1, Budapest, Hungary.  Tel: +36

European Automakers Lead in Recycling

     For decades, rebuilt parts were an example of Yankee
ingenuity -- the reuse of durable, well-designed parts.  But U.S.
OEMs are struggling to catch their competition, particularly in
Europe, where a longer look at the lifecycle of all the materials
in cars is yielding interesting innovations.  Cars are being
designed to be reused and recycled, from bumper to bumper.  In
the face of stiffened recycling rules pending for EC members, the
German automakers are especially active.  BMW is building a
recycling plant in Wackersdorf.  Volkswagen is recycling
thermoset plastic sheet molding from its front ends on Golf
models and using it on engine shields in the same car.  The
thermoset technology is particularly interesting because the
thermosets, unlike the easily meltable thermoplastics, are
created from strong interlocking compounds, and therefore resist
easy handling.  Grinding and pyrolysis -- high heat (760 degrees
C) and no oxygen -- are beginning to produce results.  Mercedes
Benz has built a demonstration car with all its recyclable
components in green.  Mercedes is recycling excess plastics from
trunk floor production, reprocessing thermoplastic and
polyurethane panels to fabricate cable wrappings and wheel wells,
extracting and reusing the "noble" metals -- platinum, rhodium,
palladium, and cerium -- from catalytic converters.
     VDA, the German automobile manufacturing association, has
developed a labeling program for automotive plastics.  The plan
is designed to ease sorting and recycling.  Volvo, perhaps the
most environmentally proactive car maker, has joined the Germans
in adopting the VDA standards.

Du Pont Paired with Industry Council to Reduce Delaware Waste

     In another public-private partnership, Du Pont (DD-NYSE) and
the Council for Solid Waste Solutions are each giving the state
of Delaware grants of US$20,000 to fund a computer software
system for the statewide reduction of solid waste.  The software,
called WastePlan, was designed by Tellus Institute, a public
interest consulting firm.  The system is in place as a statewide
planning tool in Michigan and New York and as a municipal
planning tool in Boston.  The system helps state and local
planners assess the economic and environmental impacts of
collection and disposal systems.
     Du Pont's share will pay for the software license.  The
council's half will go for training and continuing technical
support.  Du Pont's Paul Wyche put the Delaware initiative in
context, telling BATE "Du Pont has pilot solid waste projects in
Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Illinois.  In Illinois, we're
working with the state department of transportation to make
highway safety barriers from high density polyethylene.  That
project is up and running."
     Asked whether the money for the Delaware and other solid
waste initiatives came from a corporate giving budget or a line
budget, Wyche said the grants came from operating funds, and that
the set-asides for such projects were growing as Du Pont's and
the communities' awareness grew.

Trans-National Corporate Progress Against Ozone Depletion

     Company by company, CFCs and other ozone-depleting compounds
are being eliminated around the world.  Some recent developments:
     Intel Corp. (INTC-OTC), the Santa Clara, California
semiconductor maker, has plants in Ireland, Israel, Singapore,
Penang, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the USA.  Intel says it
will eliminate chloroflourocarbons (CFCs) from its worldwide
manufacturing processes by 1992.  The company began tracking CFC
use in 1987.  Using conservation and alternate technologies,
Intel has reduced its CFC usage some 30% to date.  Intel has
substituted an aqueous-based cleaner for CFC-113 on its circuit
boards and targets not only CFC-113, but also CFC-11, 12, 114,
115, TCA, and carbon tetrachloride for elimination by the target
date.  The company announcement calls the program "one of the
most aggressive in the industry."
     The Big Three Japanese carmakers are making inroads on
CFC-12, the automotive air conditioning refrigerant.  Honda has
begun a worldwide program to get cfc recycling units in the hands
of its authorized dealers.  The units capture CFC-12 from the car
systems for purification and reuse.  Each unit will cost 260,000
yen or some US$1,700.  In Japan, Honda says 2,000 of its 2,600
dealers will have the units by this fall.
     Toyota set up its CFC Action Committee in April 1989.
Toyota says it will have CFC recovery and recycling units in its
service shops worldwide by next summer.  Toyota targets the
elimination of CFC-based foaming agents in its upholstery by the
end of 1991, and like every car manufacturer, is testing
substitute refrigerants and reconfigured A/C systems using HCFC
and other more ozone-benign compounds.
     Nissan says its CFC recycling hardware will be in place at
all its dealerships and service centers worldwide by March of
1992.  And Nissan will phase out CFCs in its autotomotive air
conditioners by the end of 1995.
     Lockheed, (LK-NYSE), the aeronautics and space manufacturer,
was stung in June by a Greenpeace allegation that the company was
a "laggard, failing to halt its use of ozone-destroying
chemicals."
     Lockheed's internal timetable calls for elimination of
ozone-depleters by the year 2000, a policy it points out is
consistent with Montreal Protocol targets.  In the last two
years, Lockheed has reduced its CFC-113 emissions 39% and TCA
(1,1,1 trichloroethane) emissions by 43%.
     Lockheed's government relations manager, Katherine Strehl,
pleads that the company's requirements "are often more stringent
technically and operationally . . . because ours frequently
involve spacecraft that must function for years without repair or
replacement of parts."
     In Toronto, Northern Telecom (NT-NYSE) says it has reduced
CFC use by half in the last 18 months.  The communications giant
has saved US$1.5 million in CFC-113 reduction and another $1
million in US CFC consumption taxes avoided.  The company has
joined with the US EPA to publish a manual on CFC management
practices for small and mid-sized CFC-113 users.

Flakt Will Retrofit Taiwanese Power Plant for $115 Million

     The ABB Environmental Systems Division of Flakt, Inc., a US
subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, will design, engineer, and build
a wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system for Taiwan Power
Company's Lin Kou station near Taipei.
     Robert A. Agonis, vice president -- FGD systems for the
ABB/Flakt unit, is the project manager and just back from Taipei.
Agonis told BATE that a rising tide of democracy after the
lifting of martial law in Taiwan has produced a vocal, involved
populace with environmental concerns a high priority.  "With air
pollution going wild in Taipei," said Agonis, "the prime minister
is under considerable political pressure to make a success of
this plant."  Agonis's division won the job in competitive
bidding with contractors from Japan and West Germany.  Flakt Inc.
is the world leader in installed capacity for FGD systems.  The
US division accounts for US$500 million of the Stockholm-based
company's $2.8 billion in sales.  And Flakt's volume in turn is
part of ABB's $20.56 billion in global sales.
     The Taiwanese contract calls for the retrofit of two 350 mw
generating units -- the delivery of a turnkey FGD system.  The
technology will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 90% in a
process that combines limestone and a water spray with the flue
gas from the coal-fired plant.  As a by-product, the system
produces a commercial grade of gypsum for use in construction,
road building and concrete manufacture.
     The contact comes as the Republic of China's Economics
Ministry is launching a nation-wide energy conservation campaign.
Add the Republic of China to the list of countries, many of them
in Eastern Europe, where environmental technology vendors can
find new markets.

     State judges in New England will get training in

     State judges in New England will get training in
environmental law.  A series of seminars beginning early next
year responds to what Andrew Savitz, general counsel of the
Massachusetts Office of Environmental Affairs, calls "tidal wave
of environmental litigation about to break over the courts."  The
program is being developed by the Environmental Law Institute,
the Massachusetts Office of Environmental Affairs, and the
Flaschner Judicial Institute, an arm of the state bar
association.  The initiative is funded by a $46,500 grant from
the Jessie B. Cox Charitable Trust.
