<P>
The two diagnostic procedures currently used for evaluation of tubal patency are hysterosalpingography (HSG) and laparoscopy with chromopertubation. Each option has certain advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. 
<P>
 A hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of the uterus and the fallopian tubes which allows visualization of the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes. The  X-ray will reveal any abnormalities of the uterus as well as tubal problems such as blockage and dilation (hydrosalpinx). The HSG is considered a non-invasive procedure; it’s performed without anesthesia in an outpatient setting. One of the disadvantages of HSG is the potential for tubal spasm (reflex closure) at the cornua, which leads to the erroneous diagnosis  of tubal blockage. False-positive readings occur in as high as 40% of patients undergoing an HSG.
<P>
Laparoscopy & chromopertubation is a procedure used to evaluate pelvic structures and determine whether or not the fallopian tubes are patent (open). A laparoscope (medical grade telescope) is inserted into the patient’s abdominal cavity through the belly button.  After assessing the appearance of the pelvis, blue dye is injected via the cervix, through the uterus, and into the fallopian tubes.  Using the laparoscope, the physician observes whether or not there is free spill of the blue dye from each fallopian tube into the abdominal cavity, indicating whether the fallopian tubes are open or blocked.  However, laparoscopy & chromopertubation is an invasive procedure and does not provide the physician with an understanding of what the uterus and fallopian tubes look like inside.
