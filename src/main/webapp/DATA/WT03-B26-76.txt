<H4>4. THE ISSUE OF SCALE</H4>
The BRDF models mentioned above and used to develop the kernels are general
'average' scene models that apply to spatially averaged data over homogeneous
target areas. They do not model the image variance (which is also angle
dependent) nor do they apply to a single object in a scene. The BRDF of
a single tree is different from that of a stand of trees and the BRDF of
a stand of trees is different from that of an open soil area.<BR>
<BR>
Scaling affects the basis for image stratification. The tree and gap structure
at one scale provides different functions for a stand and bare area delineation.
At a broad scale, the composite of tree and gap merges into stands and at
another stands and clearings merge in a 'woodland' category. At each level,
th BRDF of the separated components will be different from each other and
the composite land cover.<BR>
<BR>
This leads to the consideration of some issues most important in an approach
to correcting high resolution images for BRDF effects. The atmospheric effect
is very smooth having been 'filtered' by an MTF with a size of about 200
metres in most cases. However, the BRDF is highly variable. Consider a photograph
with a wide field of view and the solar hotspot near to its centre. A tree
near the nadir view and a similar one near the edge will have different
brightnesses but the difference will not be as great as the overall brightening
due to volume and hotspot effects. In particular, there will be much more
shadow at the edges reached away from the hotspot direction and path lengths
for volume scattering will be longer through the canopy than at the geometric
centre of the frame. The 'colour' of shadow near the edges will also be
slightly darker than at the nadir but not very different. In this case,
applying an overall BRDF correction function will tend to change the colour
of shadows and tree crowns at the edge in a way that may be quite wrong
- even though the overall area average may be 'balanced'. Obviously, what
works at one scale may not help at another.<BR>
<BR>
Even if an H-resolution (high resolution) approach is taken in which the
BRDF of the objects is modelled (trees for example), the fact will still
be that the image contains different geometric proportions of scene objects
and components in a way that depends on the phase angles between the sun,
the target object(s) and the view. Perhaps the only perfect way to resolve
the issue is by 3D stereo modelling. This is unlikely to be cost-effective
with video or digitised aerial photograph data.<BR>
