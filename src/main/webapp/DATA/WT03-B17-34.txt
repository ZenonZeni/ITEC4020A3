Rhodes College has written policies on use of alcohol and other drugs on campus.  Check your Student Handbook for policies related to alcohol and drug use.  <P>
Alcohol and other drugs (whether prescription or illegal) misuse, abuse, addiction can seriously impair academic performance and your future.  Many college students cite "experimentation" with drugs and alcohol as a "right" during college and believe such experimentation is not dangerous.  Check into some of the following information about alcohol and other drugs.  Find out the facts; stop believing the myths.
