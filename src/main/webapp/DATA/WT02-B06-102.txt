<H2>CDT Press Release regarding Rep. Markey Legislation</H2>

<H3>CDT APPLAUDS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE</H3>
<BR>
The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) commends Congressman Markey
(D-MA) on the introduction of the Communications Privacy and Consumer Empowerment
Act (CPCEA).  The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal
Communications Commission to ensure that the developing communications infrastructure
supports the core privacy principles of notice and individual control. 
The FTC is currently examining privacy on the Internet.  The CPCEA directs
the FTC and FCC to report their findings to Congress within one year and
directs each to issue rules where they find a lack of privacy protection.<BR>
<BR>
Currently few people are aware of the vast amount of personal information
generated and captured -- and potentially used and disclosed -- during the
use of interactive communications media.  Most individuals visit Web sites,
read articles, and examine pictures under the false illusion that their
activities are anonymous or at least unobserved.  In an effort to increase
public demand for privacy protection, CDT recently launched a <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/">privacy
demonstration Web site  -- http://www.cdt.org.privacy/</A> -- which greets
each visitor with detailed personal information including their name, email
address, computer and browser type and the universal resource locator (URL)
indicating the Web site from which they came.  <BR>
<BR>
While interactive media offers new challenges to privacy, CDT believes that
the development and implementation of technologies that empower users of
interactive communications media to affirmatively control personal information
can fundamentally shift the balance of power between the individual and
those seeking information.  CDT believes this technological shift is possible
and necessary, and offers us an unprecedented opportunity to advance individual
privacy.  However, this shift will only occur if interactive media is harnessed
to advance individual privacy.  <BR>
<BR>
The CPCEA strongly embodies this approach.  It looks to Government as the
ultimate guarantor of core privacy principles of notice and informed consent
regarding personal information collection and dissemination on the information
highway, but adopts a process which looks to the private sector and consumer
and privacy organizations to work together to develop standards, practices
and individual control technologies---such as the Platform for Internet
Content Selection (PICS), cyberpatrol, and surfwatch--- to empower people
to control personal information about themselves during interactions with
commercial and non-commercial entities online.  As Jerry Berman, CDT Executive
Director stated, &quot;It is designed to provide strong privacy protection,
but avoid centralized, burdensome data board solutions which could cripple
the Internet and threaten free speech rights with the creation of a veritable
'Privacy Exon'.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Rather than responding to the very real risks posed by new technology
with the Luddite-call of &quot;smash the machine,&quot; we are calling for
a reversal of the technological status quo by demanding that technology
be designed to empower people.  We are pleased that Congressman Markey recognizes
the unique potential of the Internet to advance individual control over
personal information,&quot; said CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman. <BR>
<BR>
CDT hails the introduction of the CPCEA, and believes that if enacted it
will help to spur all content providers and access providers to establish
the important privacy principles of &quot;Knowledge, Notice, and No&quot;
as rules of the road for the Digital Age. <BR>
