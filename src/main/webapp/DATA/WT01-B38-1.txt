<p><font size="4"><strong>Interview with Alfred McCoy</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">November 9, 1991 (2nd Book was published in
Dec. 1992)</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Alfred W. McCoy is professor of Southeast Asian
History at the University of</font> <font size="2">Wisconsin,
Madison. Educated at Columbia and Yale, he has spent the past</font>
<font size="2">twenty years writing about Southeast Asian history
and politics. Dr. McCoy</font> <font size="2">participated in
Causes and Cures: National Teleconference on the Narcotics</font>
<font size="2">Epidemic Saturday, November 9 1991, at Marble
Collegiate Church in</font> <font size="2">Manhattan.<br>
PD: How did you come to write The Politics of Heroin; CIA
Complicity In The</font> <font size="2">Global Drug Trade?<br>
AM: In 1971 I was a graduate student doing Southeast Asian
History at Yale</font> <font size="2">University. An editor at
Harper &amp; Row, Elisabeth Jakab, read some articles</font> <font
size="2">in a volume I had edited about Laos, which made some
general references to</font> <font size="2">the opium trade in
Laos. <br>
She decided this would be a great idea for a book and asked me to
do a</font> <font size="2">background book on the heroin plague
that was sweeping the forces then</font> <font size="2">fighting
in South Vietnam. We later learned that about one third of the</font>
<font size="2">United States combat forces in Vietnam,
conservatively estimated, were</font> <font size="2">heroin
addicts.<br>
I went to Paris and interviewed retired general Maurice Belleux,
the former</font> <font size="2">head of the French equivalent of
the CIA, an organization called SDECE</font> <font size="2">[Service
de Documentation Exterieure et du Contre-Espionage]. In an
amazing</font> <font size="2">interview he told me that French
military intelligence had financed all</font> <font size="2">their
covert operations from the control of the Indochina drug trade.
[The</font> <font size="2">French protected opium trafficking in
Laos and northern Vietnam during the</font> <font size="2">colonial
war that raged from 1946 to the French defeat in 1954 at Dien
Bien</font> <font size="2">Phu.]<br>
The French paratroopers fighting with hill tribes collected the
opium and</font> <font size="2">French aircraft would fly the
opium down to Saigon and the Sino-Vietnamese</font> <font
size="2">mafia that was the instrument of French intelligence
would then distribute</font> <font size="2">the opium. The
central bank accounts, the sharing of the profits, was all</font>
<font size="2">controlled by French military intelligence.<br>
He concluded the interview by telling me that it was his
information that</font> <font size="2">the CIA had taken over the
French assets and were pursuing something of the</font> <font
size="2">same policy.<br>
So I went to Southeast Asia to follow up on that lead and that's
what took</font> <font size="2">me into doing this whole book. It
was basically pulling a thread and keep</font> <font size="2">tugging
at it and a veil masking the reality began to unravel.<br>
PD: What was the CIA's role in heroin trafficking in Southeast
Asia?<br>
AM: During the 40 years of the cold war, from the late 1940's to
this year,</font> <font size="2">the CIA pursued a policy that I
call radical pragmatism . Their mission was</font> <font size="2">to
stop communism and in pursuit of that mission they would ally
with anyone</font> <font size="2">and do anything to fight
communism.<br>
Since the 1920's the League of Nations, the forerunner of the
United</font> <font size="2">Nations, and the United States have
prohibited opium and cocaine products</font> <font size="2">from
legal sale. These products had already emerged as vast global</font>
<font size="2">commodities with very substantial production zones
and large markets, large</font> <font size="2">demand for those
commodities both in the third world and the first.<br>
The historic Asia opium zone stretches across 5,000 miles of
Asian mainland</font> <font size="2">from Turkey to Laos along
the southern borders of the Soviet Union and the</font> <font
size="2">southern border of communist China. It just so happened
that one of the key</font> <font size="2">war zones in the cold
war happened to lay astride the Asian opium zone.<br>
During the long years of the cold war the CIA mounted major
covert guerilla</font> <font size="2">operations along the
Soviet-Chinese border. The CIA recruited as allies</font> <font
size="2">people we now call drug lords for their operation
against communist China in</font> <font size="2">northeastern
Burma in 1950, then from 1965 to 1975 [during the Vietnam war]</font>
<font size="2">their operation in northern Laos and throughout
the decade of the 1980's,</font> <font size="2">the Afghan
operation against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. <br>
Powerful, upland political figures control the societies and
economies in</font> <font size="2">these regions and part of that
panoply of power is the opium trade. The CIA</font> <font
size="2">extended the mantle of their alliance to these drug
lords and in every case</font> <font size="2">the drug lords used
it to expand a small local trade in opium into a major</font> <font
size="2">source of supply for the world markets and the United
States.<br>
While they were allied with the United States these drug lords
were</font> <font size="2">absolutely immune to any kind of
investigation. If you're involved in any</font> <font size="2">kind
of illicit commodity trade, organized crime activity like drug</font>
<font size="2">trafficking, there is only one requisite for
success, immunity, and the CIA</font> <font size="2">gave them
that. As long as they were allied with the CIA, the local police</font>
<font size="2">and then the DEA stayed away from the drug lords. <br>
Finally, if there were any allegations about the involvement of
their allies</font> <font size="2">in the drug trade, the CIA
would use their good offices to quash those</font> <font size="2">allegations.<br>
This meant that these drug lords, connected with the CIA, and
protected by</font> <font size="2">the CIA, were able to release
periodic heroin surges, and [in Latin America]</font> <font
size="2">periodic cocaine surges. You can trace very precisely
during the 40 years of</font> <font size="2">the cold war, the
upsurge in narcotics supply in the United States with</font> <font
size="2">covert operations.<br>
PD: How does the CIA's policies affect drug interdiction? I've
spoken for</font> <font size="2">example to former Drug
Enforcement Administration officer Michael Levine,</font> <font
size="2">who has expressed anger that he was pulled off cases
because he got too</font> <font size="2">close to someone who,
while being a big trafficker, was also an asset of the</font> <font
size="2">CIA. <br>
AM: Mike Levine speaks from personal experience. In 1971 Mike
Levine was in</font> <font size="2">Southeast Asia operating in
Thailand as an agent of the U.S. Drug</font> <font size="2">Enforcement
Administration [DEA]. At the same time I was conducting the</font>
<font size="2">investigation for the first edition of my book.<br>
Mike Levine said that he wanted to go up country to Chiangmai,
the heroin</font> <font size="2">capital of Southeast Asia at
that point, the finance and processing center</font> <font
size="2">and hub of an enterprise. He wanted to make some major
seizures. Through a</font> <font size="2">veiled series of cut
outs in the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, instructions were</font> <font
size="2">passed to his superiors in the DEA, who told him he
couldn't go up and make</font> <font size="2">the bust. He was
pulled off the case.<br>
He said it wasn't until he read my book a number of years later
that he</font> <font size="2">understood the politics of what was
going on and he realized why he had been</font> <font size="2">pulled
off. All of the upland drug lords that were producing the
narcotic,</font> <font size="2">the heroin, were in fact CIA
assets. Now he understands it.<br>
That is not just a single incident, so let's go back to basics.
What is the</font> <font size="2">institutional relationship
between the DEA an the CIA? The Federal Bureau of</font> <font
size="2">Narcotics [FBN] was established in 1930 as an instrument
of the prohibition</font> <font size="2">of narcotics, the only
United States agency that had a covert action</font> <font
size="2">capacity with agents working undercover before World War
II. During the war</font> <font size="2">when the OSS [Office of
Strategic Services] was established, which is the</font> <font
size="2">forerunner of the CIA, key personnel were transferred
from the Federal</font> <font size="2">Bureau of Narcotics to
train the OSS officers in the clandestine arts.<br>
That close institutional relationship between the DEA [direct
descendant of</font> <font size="2">the FBN] and the CIA
continues up to the present day. The long time head of</font> <font
size="2">the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a man named Harry
Anslinger, who headed</font> <font size="2">that bureau from 1930
until his retirement in 1962, was a militant</font> <font
size="2">anti-communist who spent a lot of his time in
counter-intelligence</font> <font size="2">operations. There's a
very close relationship between the two agencies.<br>
During the cold war the main priority abroad for the United
States</font> <font size="2">government was anti-communism, and
whenever theCIA mounted an operation,</font> <font size="2">every
other U.S. agency was subordinated to the CIA's covert
operations. <br>
That meant that when the CIA was running one of its covert action
wars in</font> <font size="2">the drug zones of Asia, the DEA
would stay away. For example, during the</font> <font size="2">1950's
the CIA had this ongoing alliance with the nationalist Chinese in</font>
<font size="2">northern Burma. Initially mounting invasions of
China in 1950-51, later</font> <font size="2">mounting
surveillance along the border for a projected Chinese invasion of</font>
<font size="2">Southeast Asia. The DEA stayed out of Southeast
Asia completely during that</font> <font size="2">period and
collected no intelligence about narcotics in deference to the</font>
<font size="2">CIA's operation.<br>
Let's take two more examples that bring it right up to the
present. [First]</font> <font size="2">the Afghan operation: from
1979 to the present, the CIA's largest operation</font> <font
size="2">anywhere in the world, was to support the Afghan
resistance forces fighting</font> <font size="2">the Soviet
occupation in their country. The CIA worked through Pakistan</font>
<font size="2">military intelligence and worked with the Afghan
guerilla groups who were</font> <font size="2">close to Pakistan
military intelligence.<br>
In 1979 Pakistan had a small localized opium trade and produced
no heroin</font> <font size="2">whatsoever. Yet by 1981,
according to U.S. Attorney General William French</font> <font
size="2">Smith, Pakistan had emerged as the world's leading
supplier of heroin. It</font> <font size="2">became the supplier
of 60% of U.S. heroin supply and it captured a</font> <font
size="2">comparable section of the European market. In Pakistan
itself the results</font> <font size="2">were even more
disastrous.<br>
In 1979 Pakistan had no heroin addicts, in 1980 Pakistan had
5,000 heroin</font> <font size="2">addicts, and by 1985,
according to official Pakistan government statistics,</font> <font
size="2">Pakistan had 1.2 million heroin addicts, the largest
heroin addict</font> <font size="2">population in the world.<br>
Who were the manufacturers? They were all either military
factions connected</font> <font size="2">with Pakistan
intelligence, CIA allies, or Afghan resistance groups</font> <font
size="2">connected with the CIA and Pakistan intelligence. In May
of 1990, ten years</font> <font size="2">after this began, the
Washington Post finally ran a front page story saying</font> <font
size="2">high U.S. officials admit that Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
[leader of the Hezbi-i</font> <font size="2">Islami guerilla
group], and other leaders of the Afghan resistance are</font> <font
size="2">leading heroin manufacturers.<br>
This had been known for years, reported in the Pakistan press,
indeed in</font> <font size="2">1980 reported in McClean's
magazine. In fact in 1980 a White House narcotics</font> <font
size="2">advisor, Dr. David Musto of Yale University, went on the
record demanding</font> <font size="2">that we not ally with
Afghan guerilla groups that were involved in</font> <font
size="2">narcotics. His advice was ignored and he went public in
an op-ed in the New</font> <font size="2">York Times.<br>
Another example: Let's take the cocaine epidemic. In 1981 as
cocaine began</font> <font size="2">surging north into the United
States, the DEA assigned an agent named Tomas</font> <font
size="2">Zepeda, in June 1981, to open up an office in Honduras.
By 1983 Zepeda was</font> <font size="2">collecting very good
intelligence indicating that the Honduran military were</font> <font
size="2">taking bribes to let the aircraft through their country
to come to the</font> <font size="2">United States.<br>
Zepeda was pulled out of Honduras and that office was closed by
the DEA.</font> <font size="2">They didn't open another office in
Honduras until 1987 because Honduras was</font> <font size="2">a
frontline country in the contra war. If Zepeda's reports about
involvement</font> <font size="2">of the Honduran military had
been acted upon, the DEA would have been forced</font> <font
size="2">to take action against the Honduran military officers
who were working with</font> <font size="2">the CIA to protect
the contras.<br>
In short, there was a conflict between the drug war and the cold
war. Faced</font> <font size="2">with the choice, the United
States government chose the cold war over the</font> <font
size="2">drug war, sacrificing a key intelligence post for the
DEA in Honduras.<br>
The same thing happened in Afghanistan. During the 1980's from
the time that</font> <font size="2">heroin trade started, there
were 17 DEA agents based in Pakistan. They</font> <font size="2">neither
made nor participated in any major seizures or arrests. At a time</font>
<font size="2">when other police forces, particularly
Scandinavian forces, made some major</font> <font size="2">seizures
and brought down a very major syndicate connected with former</font>
<font size="2">president Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.<br>
PD: What is the role of banking in the heroin trade? What, if
any, are the</font> <font size="2">connections to the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal. <br>
AM: There have been three times in the past 15 years in which the
CIA's</font> <font size="2">money transfer activities have
surfaced. The first came in the late 1970's</font> <font size="2">when
the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, investigated a Nassau bank</font>
<font size="2">called the Castle Bank. It's a very interesting
bank. It was set up by a man</font> <font size="2">named Paul
Helliwell, a very senior CIA operative who had retired from the</font>
<font size="2">agency. He set up this bank and it grew into a
Latin American network of</font> <font size="2">banks. It was
used by the CIA to launder money.<br>
In essence, what appears to emerge from the investigation of the
Castle Bank</font> <font size="2">in the late 1970's, was that
the CIA did not want to move operational funds</font> <font
size="2">for covert operations through normal banking channels,
where they could be</font> <font size="2">uncovered, either by
the United States or abroad, where they could come to</font> <font
size="2">the knowledge of opponents of the agency.<br>
They preferred to work through allied banks. Banks that were
secure, that</font> <font size="2">were a little bit loose in
their accounting procedures. When the Castle Bank</font> <font
size="2">was uncovered, the IRS announced a major investigation
of the bank's money</font> <font size="2">laundering activities.
Suddenly the IRS cancelled the investigation and the</font> <font
size="2">Wall Street Journal was told by informed sources in the
IRS that the CIA had</font> <font size="2">blocked the
investigation.<br>
As soon as Castle Bank collapsed, a small merchant bank based in
Australia,</font> <font size="2">operating offshore between
Australia and southeast Asia, suddenly mushroomed</font> <font
size="2">into a global network of banks, acquiring Latin American
and European</font> <font size="2">structures that had belonged
to Castle Bank. This bank in Australia called</font> <font
size="2">the Nugan-Hand Bank began very quickly in the late
1970's, to acquire a</font> <font size="2">board of retired U.S.
intelligence officials, either CIA or various military</font> <font
size="2">intelligence services.<br>
The most prominent example, the former Director of Central
Intelligence,</font> <font size="2">William Colby, became the
legal council of Nugan-Hand Bank. The bank was</font> <font
size="2">founded by Frank Nugan, an insecure and incompetent
Australian lawyer, and</font> <font size="2">by Michael John
Hand, a man with a high school degree who had gone to</font> <font
size="2">Vietnam with the Green Berets. He had served in Laos in
the 1960's as a</font> <font size="2">contract CIA operative,
fighting with three of the people who became very</font> <font
size="2">prominent in the CIA's privatized operations, Thomas
Clines, Theodore</font> <font size="2">Shackley and Richard
Secord, all very big names in the Iran-Contra scandal. <br>
Michael John Hand was the one who worked with William Colby as
legal</font> <font size="2">counsel. One of their big operations
was to buy a former U.S. naval base in</font> <font size="2">the
Turks and Caicos islands in the Caribbean. Australian police</font>
<font size="2">investigators who examined that contract, drawn up
by William Colby for</font> <font size="2">Michael John Hand,
concluded that the plausible explanation they could</font> <font
size="2">discover for that contract was to establish a
way-station for cocaine</font> <font size="2">smuggling between
Colombia and the United States. <br>
We do know the bank was pioneering in the smuggling of heroin
between</font> <font size="2">Southeast Asia and Australia. In
the late 1970's Australia had very strict</font> <font size="2">banking
laws, and anytime you got foreign exchange you had to account for</font>
<font size="2">it. The Nugan-Hand Bank helped Australian
organized crime figures get their</font> <font size="2">money
overseas so they could buy heroin and ship the heroin back to</font>
<font size="2">Australia.<br>
The Australian police investigators documented that Michael John
Hand worked</font> <font size="2">very closely with Australia's
top criminal drug traffickers to finance the</font> <font
size="2">first shipments, the pioneering shipments, of heroin to
Australia from</font> <font size="2">Southeast Asia.<br>
In 1980 that bank went belly-up and it collapsed, Frank Nugan
committed</font> <font size="2">suicide, and then a really
amazing event occurred. Thomas Clines, the former</font> <font
size="2">CIA chief of station from Laos, a man of great
prominence in the Iran-Contra</font> <font size="2">scandal, flew
to Sydney, Australia and exfiltrated Michael John Hand, who</font>
<font size="2">disappeared in the United States and was never
seen since.<br>
Then we come to BCCI. Although we haven't gotten to the bottom of
it by any</font> <font size="2">means, we haven't even begun to
ask the questions, much less get the</font> <font size="2">answers.
BCCI mushroomed in the 1980's and seemed to serve as a similar</font>
<font size="2">conduit as Castle Bank and Nugan-Hand Bank. The
Manchester Guardian</font> <font size="2">published an expose
saying that the CIA paid its operations in the United</font> <font
size="2">Kingdom through BCCI, and it's known that the CIA paid
the Afghan</font> <font size="2">guerrillas, who were based in
Pakistan, through BCCI. <br>
There's one rather large question that nobody is asking about
BCCI. It's a</font> <font size="2">Pakistani bank, it booms
during the 1980's, in exactly the same period that</font> <font
size="2">Pakistan emerges as the world's largest heroin center.
We know the Pakistan</font> <font size="2">military officers
involved in the drug trade had their accounts with BCCI.</font> <font
size="2">There's a three way relationship that really cries out,
screams, demands, a</font> <font size="2">congressional
investigation.<br>
The relationship between BCCI and the CIA operations in
Afghanistan and</font> <font size="2">Pakistan; how much money
was the CIA moving through those accounts?</font> <font size="2">Secondly,
the relationship between the Pakistan military connected with
that</font> <font size="2">operation and BCCI. Thirdly, the
relationship between the booming heroin</font> <font size="2">trade
of Pakistan and BCCI. I think what we'll possibly discover is
that the</font> <font size="2">CIA was shipping its funds into
Pakistan through BCCI, protecting BCCI</font> <font size="2">thereby
from serious investigations elsewhere in the world. That the</font>
<font size="2">Pakistan military were in fact banking their drug
profits, moving their drug</font> <font size="2">profits from the
consuming country back to Pakistan though BCCI. In fact the</font>
<font size="2">boom in the Pakistan drug trade was financed by
BCCI.The interrelationship</font> <font size="2">between the
Afghan resistance and the CIA and the Pakistan drug trade can</font>
<font size="2">all be seen through the medium of BCCI, the banker
to both operations, the</font> <font size="2">resistance and the
drug trade.<br>
PD: What are the alternatives to the drug war?<br>
AM: In the 1980's, indeed over the last 20 years, society has
been given two</font> <font size="2">choices in the drug war. The
escalating repression against the drug trade by</font> <font
size="2">Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush while the media gave
airtime and space to</font> <font size="2">only one sustained
critique.That critique put forth by the Drug Policy</font> <font
size="2">Foundation argues that the drug war wasn't working and
therefore we should</font> <font size="2">pursue a policy of
legalization. Simply turn the whole policy of repression</font> <font
size="2">on its head, instead of trying to wipe out the drug
trade we legalize it.<br>
Let me first of all review the drug war. Is it working? No it's
not. The</font> <font size="2">current drug war budget is $11
billion, a very large amount of money. Of</font> <font size="2">that
$11 billion, 86% is devoted to the suppression of cocaine
trafficking</font> <font size="2">between the United States and
Colombia and cocaine trafficking in the U.S.</font> <font
size="2">as well. However, while we're devoting 86% of our drug
war budget to</font> <font size="2">cocaine, use of cocaine has
gone up by 15 percent. Every single indicator</font> <font
size="2">shows cocaine addiction is rising at the same time we
are fighting this drug</font> <font size="2">war.<br>
The White House is claiming victory in the drug war, William
Bennet, the</font> <font size="2">drug czar who retired several
months ago, claimed a victory, President Bush</font> <font
size="2">has alluded to a victory in the drug war, and so has the
current drug war</font> <font size="2">czar, Mr. Bob Martinez.
What they claim as a victory is a victory over</font> <font
size="2">casual drug use. Well let's face it casual drug use
doesn't count, if some</font> <font size="2">kid tries drugs and
doesn't like it that's nice but that's not the problem.<br>
The problem is repeated use, and every single indicator says
repeated use is</font> <font size="2">up. The drug war is not
working. It's filling up our prisons. The prison</font> <font
size="2">population doubled under President Reagan, and we now
have over 400</font> <font size="2">prisoners per 100,000
population versus 35 per 100,000 in Holland. We have</font> <font
size="2">the largest prison population per capita in the world
and it's going up. At</font> <font size="2">the same time our
heroin use is going up and our cocaine use is going up.<br>
The reason why is because our effort in the drug war has been
concentrated</font> <font size="2">in interdicting the supply of
drugs in the United States and over the last</font> <font
size="2">20 years we have fought this drug war on a bilateral
basis. The United</font> <font size="2">States in 1972 went into
Turkey and said &quot;wipe out your opium trade&quot; and in</font>
<font size="2">the 1980's they went into Colombia and said
&quot;wipe out your cocaine</font> <font size="2">processing
industry&quot;. In the early 1980's the U.S. went into Bolivia
and</font> <font size="2">said &quot;wipe out coca cultivation in
the western part of your country&quot;. This</font> <font
size="2">is bilateral interdiction, where the U.S. as a sovereign
power deals with</font> <font size="2">another sovereign state
and applies pressure on that sovereign state to get</font> <font
size="2">action on drugs.<br>
There is a misperception about the nature of heroin and cocaine.
These are</font> <font size="2">not petty vices, these are
complex global commodity trades involving vast</font> <font
size="2">areas of production and enormous consumption. It's a
commodity comparable in</font> <font size="2">every respect to
coffee or tea.<br>
When you bring down the baton of law enforcement on a complex
global</font> <font size="2">commodity trade something curious
and something paradoxical, something</font> <font size="2">almost
magical happens. The genius of capitalism, its magic, its
alchemy,</font> <font size="2">transform the lead of repression
into the gold of stimulus. Every time we</font> <font size="2">apply
repression upon narcotics production on this bilateral basis we</font>
<font size="2">stimulate production, and ultimately we stimulate
consumption because of the</font> <font size="2">law of supply
and demand.<br>
In 1972 President Richard Nixon wiped out the Turkish opium crop
with his</font> <font size="2">first drug war, the grandmother of
drug wars. This grandmother of drug wars</font> <font size="2">totally
wiped out Turkish opium production, and for a while it disrupted
the</font> <font size="2">French connection between Turkey, which
had supplied French labs in</font> <font size="2">Marseille,
which in turn supplied New York.<br>
It looked like victory until you see what really happened. Turkey
only grew</font> <font size="2">7% of the worlds opium. Across
the 5,000 mile band of mountains from Turkey</font> <font
size="2">in the west to Laos in the east lay the rest of the
worlds opium production,</font> <font size="2">the other 93
percent. <br>
Turkey had a shortfall of production, that meant there was a
shortfall in</font> <font size="2">supply of illicit opium. So
the price went up as would always happen, short</font> <font
size="2">supply and the price goes up. That meant farmers
elsewhere in the opium</font> <font size="2">zone, from Iran,
Afghanistan increased their production as happens every</font> <font
size="2">single time. The repression creates a shortfall in
supply which raises price</font> <font size="2">and then
stimulates production everywhere around the world.<br>
What then is the solution to the problem? Somewhere between the
poles of</font> <font size="2">repression and legalization there
is an alternative strategy which I call</font> <font size="2">regulation.
I don't think we should really fool ourselves to consider</font> <font
size="2">legalization. It's politically impractical, it's never
going to happen.<br>
If we legalize the drug we are not going to legalize it for kids,
this is a</font> <font size="2">country that just raised the
drinking age for the socially acceptable drug,</font> <font
size="2">alcohol from 18 to 21. You give me the name right now of
one legislator who</font> <font size="2">is going to stand up and
say &quot;I favor crack for kids, vote for my bill,&quot;</font> <font
size="2">nobody will ever introduce such a bill. Even if by some
miracle you got a</font> <font size="2">legalization bill it
would exclude 21 year olds and it would mean that the</font> <font
size="2">big drug, crack cocaine would have 89% of its clientele
excluded from</font> <font size="2">legalization.<br>
I favor regulation because if cocaine and heroin are commodities
let's deal</font> <font size="2">with them as such. You don't
repress commodities, you regulate them. Accept</font> <font
size="2">the fact that there is no quick fix to this trade, it's
been around for 200</font> <font size="2">years as a major global
commodity, as an illegal commodity it's been around</font> <font
size="2">for 70 years and it's likely to be around for another
70, maybe 200 years.<br>
Recognizing that you then cancel your bilateral interdiction
efforts and</font> <font size="2">transfer your funds to the
multilateral effort being run by the United</font> <font size="2">Nations.
The multilateral effort by the United Nations actually does
reduce</font> <font size="2">production slowly, painfully over a
period of decades. <br>
Ultimately we're going to have to seek an amelioration, not a
solution, on</font> <font size="2">the streets. We're going to
have to address the complex of causes as to why</font> <font
size="2">people use drugs. That is where we have to concentrate
our money.<br>
