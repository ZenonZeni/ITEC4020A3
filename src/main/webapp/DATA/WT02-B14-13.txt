<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">House
and Senate to Take on Immigration Bills</a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>In November, the full House prepared to take up the Immigration in the
National Interest bill, and in the Senate,<b> </b>Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)
on November 3 introduced the Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S1394, to add
legal immigration reform to S269, Simpson's previous bill that dealt with
illegal immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>On November 29, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration
approved S1394 on a 5-2 vote, and sent the combined bill to the full Senate
Judiciary Committee for markup.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the House and Senate bills would reduce legal immigration, which was
804,416 in FY95 and take new steps to reduce illegal immigration--1.4<b>
</b>million aliens were apprehended in the US in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's S1394 would allow the entry of 450,000 family-sponsored
immigrants to per year (down from 535,000), plus 90,000 economic/employment
immigrants (down from 140,000), plus refugees.  Immediate relatives of US
citizens -  spouses, unmarried minor children and parents - could continue to
enter the US without restriction, but the definition of immediate relative
would be narrowed in one respect: parents 65 or older would qualify only if at
least half of their children live in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A limit of 85,000 visas annually would be available for spouses and
unmarried minor children of legal immigrants who sponsor their
immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>There would no longer be visas for unskilled foreigners to fill vacant jobs
in the US.  American employers bringing foreign professionals to the US as
temporary workers to fill vacant jobs would be required to pay the prevailing
wage for that occupation and area, plus a fee of 10 percent of the foreign
worker's first year total compensation, or $10,000, whichever is higher, to a
private training fund that would prepare US workers to fill the foreigners'
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 13, a group of businesses led by the National Association of
Manufacturers held a news conference to protest Simpson's call for fees on
skilled foreign workers.  The NAM and the American Civil Liberties Union issued
a joint statement of opposition to Simpson's bill on November 29.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US employers see US universities as a "probationary system" from which
they can select the best and brightest foreigners as soon as they are
identified.  The Simpson bill initially would have required foreigners who
study in the US to return home for at least several years before seeking to
immigrate to the US, but this provision was dropped by November 29.</tt><p>
<tt>In early November, a group of California representatives called for the
House immigration bill to be split into parts dealing with legal and illegal
immigration.  Having two bills,<b> </b>observers believe, would slow the
momentum to reduce legal immigration levels.</tt><p>
<tt>In the House markup of the comprehensive revision of the laws governing
both legal and illegal immigration, much of the debate centered on provisions
that affect specific immigrants and businesses.  For example, the inclusion of
27,000 slots for "diversity immigrants" was widely considered a concession to
the Irish lobby and its representatives.  The mandatory national registry of
workers proposed in earlier versions of the bill was changed to a five-state
pilot that would apply to employers with four or more workers, a concession to
employers.</tt><p>
<tt>The House proposed few changes to permanent and temporary
economic/employment-based immigration.  However, there was a change sought by
employers in the much-criticized H-1B program, under which US employers
"attest" that they cannot find US workers to fill vacant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a number of newspaper accounts of US employers laying off US
workers to replace them with H-1B foreigners, especially in routine computer
programming.  To curb abuses by so-called "body shops" that employ mostly
Russian or Indian programmers for up to six years, the House bill says that, if
more than 15 or 20 percent of a company's labor force are H-1B workers, the
company is considered "dependent" on H-1B workers, and is subject to heightened
DOL oversight.  Non-dependent companies are subject to less DOL oversight.
</tt><p>
<tt>The welfare measures included in Congressional reforms would substitute
block grants administered by states for current federal entitlement programs
under which expenditures depended on the number of eligible persons who apply
for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal immigrants who are not US citizens would generally be ineligible for
food stamps and SSI.  Future legal immigrants would generally be ineligible for
most federal assistance for five years after their arrival, but states would
have the option of providing cash assistance and Medicaid to legal immigrants
currently in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Congress dropped a ban on immigrants receiving federal assistance for
higher education at the behest of colleges that feared they would lose
students.  About 40,000 immigrant students at CCNY receive Pell grants, and
7,000 receive student loans.</tt><p>
<tt>Congress also permitted immigrant children to participate in Head Start,
but both their parents' income, as well as the income of whoever sponsored them
as immigrants, would be taken into account when determining eligibility for
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The Medicaid reforms in Congress would create a $627 million fund to cover
the cost of providing medical services to illegal aliens in the 15 states with
the most illegal aliens.  California spends $17 billion on Medi-Cal, the
California version of medical assistance for the poor, that serves about five
million persons.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Parts
of Prop. 187 </a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>Unconstitutional</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A federal judge in Los Angeles declared most sections of Prop. 187
unconstitutional in a 72-page ruling issued on November 20, 1995.  According to
the judge, "The authority to regulate immigration belongs exclusively to the
federal government, and state agencies are not permitted to assume that
authority."  </tt><p>
<tt>Thus, California may not develop a system for having teachers, doctors, and
other service providers report suspected illegal aliens, and state efforts to
deny K-12 education to illegal alien children, or welfare benefits that are
partially federally funded, are unconstitutional.  California may deny illegal
aliens post-secondary education, and services that are completely state funded,
which means that California colleges and universities may be able to ask the
INS about an applicant's immigration status and deny admission to those who are
undocumented.</tt><p>
<tt>The judge's ruling means that the fate of Prop. 187 will be decided without
a trial, in which experts may have been called to testify about the number of
illegal immigrants, and the reasons why they come to the US and seek benefits.
</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson on November 30 asked the Los Angeles judge to reconsider
that part of her ruling that prevents California from denying K-12 education to
illegal alien children.  According to Wilson, the US Supreme Court in its 1982
Plyer v Doe ruling said that Texas must educate unauthorized children because
the state presented no evidence that educating such children caused the state
any hardship.  Wilson asserted that California has such evidence--it estimates
the cost of educating unauthorized children at more than $1.5 billion
annually.</tt><p>
<tt>The State of California plans to appeal the judge's ruling, first to the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and eventually to the US Supreme Court.  Most the
provisions of Prop. 187 will not be implemented during the appeals
process.</tt><p>
<tt>Many observers believe that approval of Prop 187 in November 1994, plus
Congressional actions that restrict the access of non-US citizens to welfare
and other benefits, is responsible for the upsurge in applications for US
citizenship.  About one-third of the 25 million foreign-born persons in the US
are naturalized US citizens, and another 10 to 12 million are eligible to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 340,000 applications for US citizenship in FY92, 592,000 in
FY94, and a record one million in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>A Los Angeles health clinic says that despite a seven-month campaign to
educate patients about Prop. 187, visits to the clinic remain 25 percent below
pre-Prop 187 levels.  Doctors in Los Angeles estimate that there has been a 40
percent drop in the number of women visiting the clinic during the first
trimester of pregnancy.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">INS</a></a></a></a>:
 Employee Verification and
Gatekeeper</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On October 31, the INS announced a pilot program in California that will
permit more than 200 small companies to verify the right to work of their
newly-hired employees by logging onto an INS database.  The INS plans to expand
the service to 1,000 employers in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Companies in Santa Ana and the City of Industry are voluntarily
participating in the screening.  Critics asserted that even though a worker's
documents are supposed to be checked only after the worker is hired, employers
would use the computer system to pre-screen workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the pilot computer system, companies transmit the INS A-numbers of
immigrant workers, and they are told instantly whether the worker is legally
authorized to work in the US.  If the worker's A-number appears to be invalid,
the INS promises a check within three days.  If this second investigation also
finds that the number is invalid, the worker can continue to work for 30 days,
but must visit the INS to straighten out his or her status within that
period.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on November 30 announced that it would accept proposals from
employers to complete the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification Form
electronically.  US employers are asked to submit ideas for maintaining the
integrity of the check while reducing their paper work.</tt><p>
<tt>During a three-week test in Anaheim in October 1995, police questioned each
person arrested about their legal status, and 37 percent of the 750 persons
arrested admitted that they were in the US illegally.  The INS in Los Angeles
broke up a forged documents business that had materials on hand to create
79,000 false ID sets.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS continues to step up the number of aliens removed from the US.  In
FY95 the INS apprehended about 1.4 million aliens who were unlawfully in the
US.  Almost all left the US voluntarily, but 49,000 were removed, either by
being excluded from the US, or after deportation proceedings.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of those who leave the US voluntarily, are excluded and deported are
Mexicans.  For example, 80 percent of the criminals removed, and 73 percent of
the non-criminals removed in October 1995 were Mexicans, followed by nationals
of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.</tt><p>
<tt>News articles on Operation Gatekeeper said that the INS had, in the $46
million initiative, succeeded in sharply cutting the influx of illegal aliens
in the westernmost section of the border with a three-tiered system of fences,
lights, and agents.  However, it is also clear that there are more illegal
entries further east, where the INS has not yet developed the three-tiered
border control system.</tt><p>
<tt>Residents in eastern San Diego, where apprehensions have jumped, are
reportedly so upset by aliens crossing their property that some have begun
taking vigilante actions against the aliens.  Local law enforcement officials
have warned residents not to shoot persons walking across their
property.</tt><p>
<tt>In late October, the Border Patrol moved to fire five agents--one who, in
November 1993, hit an alien over the head with a rock, and four who covered up
the incident.  The Border Patrol agent who told the truth about the incident
was threatened by other agents, and transferred away from the border for his
safety.  The Border Patrol agents' union is appealing the terminations.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-November, the INS announced that it would have to close 25 interior
offices, including the INS office in Fresno, if Congress orders the agency to
put yet more agents on the border.  Critics noted that it appears that
Congressional Republicans would rather target Mexican workers at the border
than the US employers who hire them.</tt><p>

<tt>On October 30, 1995, Quebec voted 51 to 49 percent to remain part of
Canada--a switch of 25,000 votes would have led to a vote for separation.  Some
supporters of separation blamed non-French speaking minorities for voting to
remain part of Canada--the 82 percent of Quebec's seven million residents who
speak French mostly supported separation, while the 18 percent who do not speak
French mostly opposed it.</tt><p>
<tt>Quebec's premier blamed the narrow defeat on "money and the ethnic vote."
He later said his remarks were too harsh but did not retract them.  He resigned
later in the week.  Quebec's deputy premier surrendered his cabinet post as
immigration minister on November 10 after a newspaper reported he had yelled at
a Latina hotel desk clerk after the vote-- blaming her and her fellow
immigrants for the defeat of the independence referendum.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since the vote, many minority residents are concerned about the future,
expecting that the next general election in two years will bring another
separatist referendum.</tt><p>
<tt>Quebec absorbed 212,413 immigrants from 1990 to 1994, and only 11,747 came
from France.  Lebanon, Hong Kong and Haiti sent the largest numbers.  After the
vote, many immigrants in Quebec reportedly plan to leave Quebec for other
provinces.</tt><p>
<tt>Quebec accounts for about 25 percent of Canada's population and 22 percent
of its GDP.  A 1980 referendum resulted in 60 percent of Quebec voters voting
to stay in Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>US House of Representative Speaker Newt Gingrich said on October 30 that
the referendum was a "warning" to Americans about the dangers of a bilingual
society.  He said that the possible split in Canada may give impetus to the
"English First" movement in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada on November 17 announced changes in its system for selecting about
25,000 skilled immigrants annually, and their 35,000 dependents.  The purpose
of the changes is to encourage the immigration of persons who have enough
education to quickly change occupations, and minimize competition with young
and unemployed Canadians.  </tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment rate in Canada is 9.4 percent, and almost 16 percent for
persons under 25.  Unemployment peaked in 1990-92, when 1.5 million persons
were unemployed.  Today, there are about 1.4 million unemployed Canadians,
despite adding 1.4 million jobs, because 1.3 million workers joined the labor
force.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the revised point system, immigrants seeking to come to Canada
through the point system would receive up to 20 percent of the maximum number
of points for education, 20 percent for English or French, more points for
persons 25 to 35 to avoid competing with under-25 year old Canadians.  The top
five sources of skilled worker immigration to Canada are Hong Kong, China, UK,
Philippines, and South Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>The changes affect about 40 percent of the immigrants who arrive in
non-Quebec Canada; Quebec has its own immigrant selection system. </tt><p>
<tt>Some Canadians who endorsed NAFTA hope to increase Mexican migration to
Canada.  Mexico has expanded summer programs under which up to 10,000 Mexicans
come to Canada to learn English or French, and some universities are recruiting
Mexican students.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada plans to strengthen its affirmative action program with Bill C-64,
expected to be approved in 1996.  Under Canada's Federal Employment Equity Act
of 1986, four groups of persons are afforded affirmative action
protection--women, who were 46 percent of the Canadian labor force in 1991, and
held 46 percent of the jobs covered by the current law; some nine percent of
the labor force were 'visible minorities,' and held eight percent were in jobs
covered by the Employment Equity Law; aboriginals, one percent of the labor
force; and disabled persons, 2.6 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Almost 80 percent of the 1.9 million visible minorities in Canada's labor
force are immigrants.  For example, Chinese-Canadians are about 26 percent of
Canada's visible minorities, and 81 percent are immigrants.  Indeed, over
three-fourths of the visible minorities covered by Canadian affirmative action
are immigrants, and almost half of them arrived within the past decade.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada's affirmative action law grew out of the Abella Royal Commission on
Equality in Employment in 1983.  The Abella Commission recommended that
affirmative action be based on Canada's 1983 Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
which permits discrimination to ameliorate "conditions of disadvantaged
individuals or groups."</tt><p>
<tt>In Ontario, a year-old affirmative action program based on workers
self-reporting their status to establish firm-by-firm employment goals is under
attack and may be repealed.  The NDP government approved an employment equity
program in September 1994, but the new provincial government has announced that
it plans to repeal the legislation.</tt><p>

Economic Uncertainty</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On October 29, the Mexican government announced a new pacto, the Alliance
for Economic Recuperation, a government, employer, and union agreement to link
growth, inflation, and wage increases.  The pacto projects real growth of three
percent in 1996, and an inflation rate of 20 percent.  In 1995, the Mexican
economy is expected to shrink by six percent, and inflation is expected to be
50 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has a series of minimum wages, and the pacto would raise most
minimum wages by 20 percent to about $3 per day at a $1 to 7 peso exchange
rate.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 8, the Mexican peso reached a low of 7.8 pesos=$1.  Short-term
interest rates rose to 54 percent, threatening to prolong Mexico's recession.
Despite more privatizations, Mexico expects to attract only $5 billion in FDI
in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1987, Mexico has used pactos to establish its macroeconomic policies.
The exchange rate was used as an anti-inflation policy, which means that Mexico
allowed the peso to depreciate against the dollar, but not enough to compensate
for Mexico's much higher inflation rate.  This too-slow peso devaluation
allowed the peso to become overvalued in 1994, which in turn encouraged Mexican
companies to buy foreign companies and foreign machinery.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico could buy more from other countries than it sold to them because
foreigners poured money into Mexico in the hope that it would be the world's
next fast-growing economy.  Shocks in 1994, such as political assassinations,
would normally have led to faster devaluation, but were not permitted to do so,
in part because of the presidential election campaign.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has a much lower savings rate than the Asian Tiger economies--
savings are only 16 percent of GDP in Mexico-- causing Mexico to rely on
foreigners' savings to finance development, and thus making Mexico vulnerable
to wild swings in investment, interest rates, and the value of the peso.  In an
effort to increase savings, the October 29 pacto includes reforms of Mexico's
52-year old social security system (IMSS), which currently has about 10 million
worker-members and, with their families, covers some 39 million
Mexicans.</tt><p>
<tt>The comprehensive IMSS provides health care, pensions of $2 per day after
age 65, and offers a number of other services, from theaters to discount
stores.  When it was established, the average Mexican lived to be less than 50,
so that funds were available to establish a hospitals and clinics and provide
other services as contributions exceeded expenditures.  Today, Mexicans live to
be 70, on average, and it is estimated that, by 2002, payouts and expenses will
exceed employer and worker contributions.</tt><p>
<tt>Workers and employers contributed about 25 percent of gross pay to IMSS;
for a clerk earning $185 per month, the IMSS contribution is about $45, of
which the worker pays $11.  The reform announced October 29 would permit
workers to establish Individual Retirement Accounts rather than join the IMSS,
and permit self-employed persons, and those in the informal economy, to join
IMSS.</tt><p>
<tt>The IMSS lost one million members in 1995 as workers lost their jobs, and
there are few jobs for workers joining the labor force this year.</tt><p>
<tt>The economic recession in Mexico has highlighted severe rural poverty in
Chiapas, Guerrero, Puebla, Oaxaza, Hidalgo, Veracruz, Michoacan, and Durango.
By one estimate, four million Mexican children under the age of five are
malnourished.</tt><p>
<tt>US interest in and concern about Mexico has grown sharply since NAFTA went
into effect on January 1, 1994.  Most experts argue that NAFTA did more than
simply ratify inevitable economic integration, but it did not give Mexicans and
Americans a sense that their fates are intertwined in the manner in which the
EU links the fates of Europeans in member countries.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of maquiladoras rose to 2,600 by the end of 1995; some 600,000
Mexicans work in these foreign-owned assembly plants in the border area.  About
40 percent of US-Mexican trade in manufactured goods is within one firm, as
when Sony sends picture tubes to the Mexican maquiladora that makes TVs, and
imports the finished televisions into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Each NAFTA country has established a National Advisory Committee to
implement the labor side agreement to NAFTA.  The 12-member US NAO met for the
first time in November 1995, and discussed tackling issues that include child
labor and migrant workers.  The US NAO has a fax-on-demand service to provide
information on the labor side agreement: (202) 273-3454 or (202)
273-4315.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of complaints about Sony's firing of union activists in April
1994 at its Nuevo Laredo factory, a tripartite meeting on union registration
and certification procedures was held November 8-9, 1995 in San Antonio.  The
fired workers attempted to field an opposition slate of candidates in a union
election and, when that failed, they called for a wildcat strike.  The fired
workers accepted severance pay from Sony.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's Labor Ministry allegedly failed to recognize the independent union
that Sony's workers wanted to organize and, with the support of the established
union affiliated with the dominant Mexican union federation CTM, Sony fired the
union activists for not being union members of the recognized union.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican unions have supported a complaint by 235 Hispanic workers who lost
their jobs when Sprint closed a facility near San Francisco just before an
election in which the Communications Workers of America sought to represent
them.</tt><p>
<tt>Between January 1, 1994 and September 30, 1995, the Labor Department
certified 42,221 US workers as eligible for TAA assistance.  Of those, 31,876
were declared eligible in fiscal year 1995, compared with 10,345 in the first
nine months of 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>The Labor Department has certified workers as eligible for NAFTA-TAA
benefits in 317 of the 589, or about 54 percent, of the petitions filed and
reviewed since January 1, 1994.  Cases in which US workers lost jobs because
production shifted to Mexico include Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. of Syracuse,
New York, which displaced 2,600 workers; Regency Packing Co. of Naples,
Florida, (1,334 workers); Woodward Governor Co. of Stevens Point, Wisconsin
(1,330 workers); Lockheed of Fort Worth, Texas (1,200 workers); Louisiana
Pacific Corp. of Portland, Oregon (1,143 workers); Copper Range Co. of White
Pine, Michigan (1,133 workers).</tt><p>
<tt>The top three US imports from Mexico so far in 1995 are electrical
machinery, equipment and parts ($5.2 billion in 1995), Mexican oil ($4.1
billion), and vehicles ($4.3 billion).</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's government noted and rejected a resolution passed by California's
Republican party that asked Mexico not to implement dual nationality.  Under
the proposal being considered by Mexico's Congress, Mexicans could retain their
right to own and inherit property in Mexico even if they became US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been fears that some of the 1.3 million Mexicans apprehended in
the US each year would apply for asylum to obtain the right to work at least
temporarily in the US.  However, no Mexicans who applied for asylum were
approved between 1990 and 1993.  In FY95, some 9,300 Mexicans applied for
asylum in the US, and 54 were granted asylum, including environmentalists and
government critics.  </tt><p>
<tt>At the end of November, corruption in Mexico was highlighted when the wife
of the brother of ex-President Salinas was arrested in Geneva attempting to
withdraw some of the $84 million Raul Salinas had deposited there under a
different name.  Even though Raul Salinas never reported more than $192,000 per
year in income, he managed to acquire a number of properties in Mexico, plus
bank deposits in Switzerland and elsewhere.  According to the Mexican Attorney
General, 80 percent of the federal judicial police are corrupt.</tt><p>

<tt>US officials in Bangkok estimate that 2,000 people each month--Thais,
Chinese, and Indians and Pakistanis--are smuggled to the US via Bangkok.  In
many cases, US employers and brothel owners finance the illegal entry, which
can cost up to $35,000.  The illegal workers then pay off the debt by working
in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>According to US authorities, some Thai travel agents specialize in
supplying false travel documents to Thais seeking US tourist visas, and corrupt
Thai immigration and airline employees help them to leave the country.  The US
has begun a crackdown on illegal aliens at the source--in Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>A Chinese woman who was smuggled into New York by boat for $29,000 in 1994
was killed by Chinese gangs in New York after her family in China did not pay
the $38,000 ransom they demanded when they kidnapped her in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The case illustrates the relative ease with which families in the Fujian
region of China, where per capita incomes are less than $500 per year, raise
the equivalent of 60 years local earnings to send a family member illegally to
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Most illegal Chinese immigrants to the US come from three counties outside
Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, largely because of the ready
availability of smugglers, and the means<b> </b>and willingness to pay them --
in part from remittances from those in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The case also illustrated the dangers faced by such illegal aliens in the
US.  Competing "snakehead" gangs that smuggle Chinese aliens into the US
sometimes kidnap illegal Chinese immigrants, as in this case, and then demand
ransom from relatives in China.</tt><p>
<tt>There are reports that the Chinese exodus to the US is waning primarily
because there are fewer Chinese taking the risk of placing themselves in the
hands of smugglers who often exploit them.  The Chinese government claims that
a massive education campaign on the dangers of smuggling is responsible for the
decline.  After the Golden Venture fiasco, dozens of smugglers were arrested
and imprisoned by the Chinese government. </tt><p>
<tt>The main result of the crackdown on smugglers is that fewer Chinese are
leaving by boat.  With more money, those wishing to go to the US can pay to fly
first to Central American or the Caribbean, then on to Puerto Rico, and finally
to the US.</tt><p>

Foreign Workers in
US</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Debate has been increasing in the US about whether skilled foreign workers
who are recruited to work in the US are displacing American workers.  The
debate is also raising the issue of whether America is producing enough
home-grown scientists and engineers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Center for Immigration Studies in Washington DC reports that 12 percent
of America's scientists and engineers in 1990 were foreign-born professionals.
Many of the foreign science and engineering students in US universities remain
in the US after graduation.  The National Science Foundation reports that 49
percent of the PhDs in computer science in 1993 were awarded to foreigners, up
from 36 percent in 1983.  </tt><p>
<tt>Corporations and universities argue that the US does not have enough
skilled workers to fill all the jobs offered, and that, to keep the US economy
competitive, US companies must have easy access to the world's best and
brightest.</tt><p>
<tt>Companies<b> </b>may not ask for foreign workers if American workers are
available.  But many companies get around that law by writing job descriptions
tailored to fit particular foreign candidates.  The most well-documented cases
of US worker displacement occur in routine software programming.  There,
temporary H-1B visa workers have undercut some US programmers. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign doctors provide a classic example of the dilemmas involved in
reversing the incentives to employ foreigners in a particular occupation and
area.  About 149,000 foreign-born doctors are practicing in the US, making them
about 20 percent of all US doctors.  In recent years, about 25,000 foreigners
have entered the US each year for medical training .  Some 75 to 90 percent
stay in the US by agreeing to practice in "medically underserved" areas,
usually by obtaining visa waivers from federal agencies, even though foreigners
who enter the US for medical education must sign a pledge to leave.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to critics, the federal policy of paying $150,000 per for each
doctor in training, regardless of his/her nationality, has encouraged hospitals
in the inner cities and rural areas to depend on foreign medical school
graduates.  The hospitals that employ foreign doctors argue that only foreign
doctors are willing to provide medical care in these areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Doctors' median incomes dropped in 1994 to $150,000, while the median
household income of all Americans rose slightly to $32,264 in 1994.  One reason
why doctors' incomes fell is that the number of doctors more than doubled
between 1965 and 1995, from 266,000 to 661,000.  Despite the addition of
150,000 doctors over the past decade, the number of medically underserved areas
has increased.</tt><p>
<tt>A panel of experts has recommended reducing the number of slots in medical
schools by 20 to 25 percent over the next decade.  In 1994, there were some
45,000 applicants for 16,000 slots in US medical schools.  There were 23,500
international medical graduates in training in US medical schools in 1994, and
the report urged their number to be reduced.</tt><p>
<tt>In Calexico, California, a town on the US-Mexican border about 100 miles
east of San Diego, Filipina nurses recruited under the Nurses Relief Act of
1989, which expired on September 30, 1995, were placed at a hospital that went
bankrupt, leaving them unpaid.  The 10 nurses were recruited by Gems
International in Manila; each paid Gems $3,500, plus 10 percent of their first
year's wages, for transportation and fees.  Gems has since gone out of
business, although its president is operating another recruitment
agency.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the NRA, nurses must stay with the hospital that recruited them or
find their visas invalidated.  It was this requirement that reportedly kept the
Filipina nurses in Calexico even though they were not being paid
regularly.</tt><p>
<tt>Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has latched onto the issue of foreign
workers in his campaign.  He says that low-wage immigrants and low-wage foreign
workers compete with native-born Americans and drive wages down.  His solution
is to restrict immigration and imports. </tt><p>
<tt>The au pair program, which grants 10,000 young Europeans 13-month visas to
care for children in US homes, lapsed temporarily in October 1995, prompting
protests from families that were counting on the arrival of au pairs.  Under
this "cultural exchange" program, European girls aged 18 to 25 are recruited
through one of eight US agencies and matched with US families willing to pay an
agency fee and travel expenses of about $4,000, plus $115 per week, but no
Social Security or other payroll taxes.</tt><p>
<tt>The cost of an au pair is about $200 per week over 13 months, or about
$10,000 annually, versus $300 per week, plus payroll taxes and benefits, or
$15,000 to $20,000, for US nannies.  Complaints from US nannies about unfair
competition, and questions about the cultural exchange value of child care
duties of up to 45 hours per week, prompted changes in the program that require
au pairs to receive at least 32 hours of training, and to take at least six
hours of courses at a US college or university.</tt><p>

<tt>Between November 15 and 30, over 1,100 Haitians were stopped in boats en
route to Florida.  By comparison, only about 300 Haitians were picked up
between the time 20,000 US troops entered Haiti in October 1994 and November
15, 1995.  Haitians are reportedly paying smugglers up to $3,000 each to be
taken to the US.  The 6,000 UN troops in Haiti are scheduled to leave in
February 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The fifth round of bilateral negotiations between the United States and
Cuba ended on November 28, 1995.  Cuba and the US were unable to agree to a
reduction in the $750 fee imposed on Cubans who want to emigrate to the US.
Cuban sources said they will seek to maintain the previously agreed upon 20,000
minimum of US visas to be granted annually to Cubans who wish to emigrate to
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The countries also failed to agree upon the fate of 1,200 Cubans in US
detention centers who arrived during the 1980 Mariel boatlift.  The US claims
that the detainees have criminal backgrounds; Havana counters that the US
government is exaggerating the criminal background of the detainees.  At the
July talks, Cuba pledged to continue to prevent a mass exodus of Cubans bound
for the US.</tt><p>
<tt>In the past 10 months, the US government issued more than 24,000 entry
visas to Cubans.  The US promised to grant at least 20,000 immigration visas
per year to Cubans in 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban economy has shrunk by almost one-third since 1990, including a 15
percent drop in GDP in 1993.  Cuba has opened its door to foreign investors to
stimulate its economy, and keep migrants at home, but its efforts to attract
foreign businesses have been hampered by anti-business regulations and
attitudes.  Since 1990, about $737 million in foreign investment has been
announced--one third is from Mexico, and another third is from Spain and
Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of a conference in Havana on "The Nation and Migration," the
Cuban government announced that the 1.2 million overseas Cubans will be able to
obtain travel documents that would allow then to come and go as they please for
up to two years.  Cubans abroad send an estimated $400 million to the island.
</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 11 million Cubans; they represent about one-third of the
population of the Caribbean.  There are about two million Cubans living off the
island; half are in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Cubans can exchange their pesos for dollars, in Cuba's increasingly
dollarized economy, at a mid-November rate of 25 to 30 pesos for $1.  An
average salary in Cuba is 125 pesos per month.</tt><p>
<tt>While foreigners are in theory allowed to buy land, the Cuban constitution
prohibits the sale of land, so foreigners must lease rather than buy the land
on which their facilities sit.  Foreign businesses are required to pay their
Cuban workers in dollars at the official $1 to 1 peso rate, although the black
market rate is $1 to 25 pesos.  The Cuban government pays workers employed by
foreign businesses in pesos, and pockets the difference.</tt><p>
<tt>There is widespread agreement that the US embargo on trade with Cuba will
soon be lifted; former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Benston, among others, asserted
that if the US can lift the embargo on Vietnam, where American soldiers lost
their lives, it can resume trade with Cuba.  US businessmen are visiting Cuba,
and signing letters of intent to do business there if the embargo is
lifted.</tt><p>
<tt>Canadian mining and other businesses already operating in Cuba report that
the educated Cuban labor force can run high-productivity facilities with few
expatriate managers--Cuba's literacy rate is reported to be higher than
Canada's.  However, it is reportedly difficult to make long-term business plans
because the legal and regulatory framework is still evolving--the Cuban peso
was made convertible in 1993, a Central Bank was established in 1994, and the
foreign investment law was approved in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 200,000 Cubans have taken advantage of the right to be self-employed,
but they are so far prohibited from hiring employees, a prohibition that may be
dropped in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The integration of Cuba into the North American economy is expected to have
repercussions throughout the Caribbean.  Several of the larger Caribbean
nations, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which together have over
40 percent of the Caribbean's 36 million people, fear that current US interest
and investment may move to Cuba.  In some Caribbean nations, 10 to 20 percent
of the population born on the island lives in the US.</tt><p>

<tt>At a November 27 and 28 development conference with the 15 members of the
EU and 12 southern and eastern Mediterranean neighbors, Mediterranean countries
agreed to try to curb the flow of immigrants to the north.  Dubbed the
Barcelona Declaration, the agreement was part of a blueprint for increasing
economic progress in the Mediterranean basin through increased trade and
political cooperation.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany had pressed to have the Mediterranean nations agree to take back
their nationals who were caught working illegally in the northern European
countries.  The final wording speaks not of an obligation to take back
nationals, but of a vaguer responsibility to accept the return of nationals
apprehended in Europe--" the partners, aware of their responsibility for
readmissision, agree to adopt the relevant provisions and measures, by means of
bilateral agreements or arrangements, in order to readmit their nationals who
are in an illegal situation."</tt><p>
<tt>German officials said they will continue to pursue the matter in bilateral
talks. </tt><p>
<tt>As the officials argued over the final Barcelona Declaration, about 5,000
people marched through the city streets protesting the "wall of shame" the EU
is creating in immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>The final declaration called for the establishment of an EU-Mediterranean
free trade area by 2010, and $6 billion in EU aid to its Mediterranean
neighbors.  Algeria and Egypt pressed to have agriculture included in the
proposed free trade clause, but the EU rejected their request.  Algeria's
foreign minister asserted that "The EU's common agricultural policy is
protectionist so you cannot talk about free trade and block a part of
commercial activity."</tt><p>
<tt>The EU has a GDP of $7 trillion; the 12 southern and eastern Mediterranean
nations have a GDP of about $400 million.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and France are working on a four-point plan for the next round of
European integration, which includes a proposal to yield more immigration and
asylum powers to Brussels.  The initiative will be finalized at the December 7
Franco-German summit. </tt><p>
<tt>The European Commission would draw up laws on visas and asylum rights, and
ensure they are enforced.  The European Court of Justice would rule on cases
where EU law had not been properly applied.  France is reluctant to cede
immigration authority to the EU.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council issued a list of 100 countries
that will face strict visa requirements for the next six months.  Bulgaria and
Romania are the two of the six former Communist nations on the
blacklist.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bulgarian parliament requested that Bulgaria be removed from the list.
The Bulgarian government is especially concerned because Bulgaria would like to
join the EU.  The parliament said that the removal of Bulgaria from the list
will support democracy and economic reform in the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>The EU signed an accord on November 11 with Morocco that will be combined
with similar deals with Tunisia and Israel to form the cornerstone of the
future Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.  Illegal immigration has been a
sticking point because the diplomats argue that the issue is out of place in
the Morocco accord.  Therefore, the ministers compromised, agreeing that
countries should be allowed to negotiate individually with Rabat about
immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>On December 1-2, the EU is scheduled to tackle the smuggling of prostitutes
into Western Europe.  The International Organisation for Migration reports that
most of the women are Eastern Europeans are under 25, and smuggled into Western
Europe by gangs.</tt><p>
<tt>One million foreigners became nationals of one of the present 15 EU member
nations between 1990 and 1993, according to Eurostat, the EC statistical office
in Luxembourg.  Most of those naturalized in Europe were from Morocco, Turkey,
or ex-Yugoslavia.  France naturalized the most foreigners-- 233,000--followed
by the UK, with 218,000; Benelux, 204,000, Germany, 129,000, and Sweden,
116,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of naturalizations doubled between 1981 and 1993.  Most of those
naturalized were from non-EU nations, rather than e.g., Germans opting for
French nationality--only nine percent, or 26,000, of the 290,000
naturalizations in 1993 were citizens of one EU nation who were naturalized in
another.</tt><p>
<tt>In France and Germany - traditional destinations for migrant workers -
rates of naturalization for the most populous groups (Algerian, Moroccan and
Portuguese in France, Turkish in Germany) remain low.  There has been a sharp
rise in the number of Asians naturalized in Sweden--most arrived as refugees -
-a development not observed elsewhere in the EU.  The UK had the highest
percentage of Asians who naturalized - nearly 18,000 or a third of the EU
total.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the EU nationals who became citizens of another European country
became naturalized Swiss citizens--some 6,046 Europeans were naturalized in
1993.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">British
Immigration
Plan</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>After the November 15 Queen's Speech, Home Secretary Michael Howard
announced a new crackdown on bogus asylum seekers and seven-year jail terms for
those who violate immigration law, such as marriage brokers.  Howard also
announced that asylum seekers who come from neighboring third countries, such
as Germany or France, will be returned to those countries within 24 hours.
Asylum seekers wishing to appeal will have to remain in the third country, and
will not be allowed to return to Britain during the appeal process.</tt><p>
<tt>In a newspaper article outlining his reforms on November 20, Howard said
that Britain "should be a haven (for refugees), not a honey pot."</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration package also includes employer sanctions: employers would
be required to check the immigration status of new hires and makes it a
criminal offense to hire illegal aliens.  Employers are displeased with the
measures, especially the criminal sanctions.  One business leader argued during
a television interview that the new rules would dissuade employers form hiring
any new workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>As expected, the Home Office confirmed that the bill will include a "white
list" of countries that the UK government deems safe.  Although the final list
has not been released, Howard has confirmed that Nigeria, Algeria and Sri Lanka
are not included.  The first safe countries on the list are expected to include
Poland, Romania and Bulgaria; India and Pakistan; states of the former Soviet
Union; and some countries in South America and Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>Labour's Tony Blair called for the bill to be referred to a Commons
standing committee, and for expert witness testimony to deflate the "race
card," instead of having the bill considered in the charged atmosphere of the
Commons.  Although initially sympathetic to Labor's proposal, Prime Minister
John Majors rejected the idea, according to Labor, to make the Labour Party
appear to be soft on immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 2, it was revealed that Home Secretary Howard, who has
steadfastly said that British immigration policy will be decided in Britain,
had secretly agreed with other European ministers on a coordinated immigration
and asylum policy.  Two key proposals in the Immigration and Asylum Bill were
agreed to behind closed doors in 1992.  The first of the proposals was the
development of the "white list," which was adopted by EU home affairs ministers
in London in 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt>The second proposal - the abolition of full appeal rights to those refugees
arriving via a safe third country - appears in an EU resolution, adopted by
Howard in Luxembourg in June.  The Home Office said in response that the
resolutions were agreed to because they did not conflict with proposals for
stopping illegal immigration to Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>At a November 23 European Union meeting in Brussels, Howard voted against a
set of far-reaching proposals aimed at stopping racist violence in Europe.  The
British Home Secretary's lone veto was enough to block the resolution, drawn up
over the past several month within the Council of Ministers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The measures defeated included: enacting laws in each member state to
confiscate racist or inflammatory publications, videos, films and TV programs,
a European wide intelligence center to monitor extremist activities, and
enacting uniform penalties for racist materials.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC14">Italian
Immigration Decree</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Prime Minister Lamberto Dini issued an emergency decree on November 16
which would permit the expulsion from Italy of non-EU citizens who commit
crimes within six to 10 days.  </tt><p>
<tt>The decree tightens loopholes in the five-year old Martelli law.  Under
that law, only about one-sixth of the illegal immigrants served with expulsion
orders left the country.  There are approximately 500,000 illegal immigrants,
and another one million foreigners living legally in Italy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Reaction to the decree was split.  The far-right felt that the decree did
not go far enough, and urged Dini to arrest all illegal immigrants and
immediately expel them from the country.  One Northern League party member
suggested returning illegal immigrants in air force transport planes, and
parachuting them into their country of origin.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Northern League, who holds the parliamentary balance of power, walked
out on November 17, and threatened to withdraw from Parliament to protest the
weak immigration law.  This could have led to the fall of Dini's 10-month old
government.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Italian president signed the measure on November 18 which, effective
immediately, allows the deportation of illegal immigrants and makes employers
who hire them liable to fines.  The decree permits undocumented aliens who have
jobs in Italy to regularize their status within four months.  The decree must
be approved by Parliament within 60 days. </tt><p>
<tt>The left wing parties do not agree with immediate expulsion, and the
Catholic Church urged tolerance and finding a way to solve the problems
creating immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign language teachers from Spain, Germany, and France have sued Italy
under the freedom of movement clause (Article 48) for failing to provide the
foreigners with the same benefits as Italian teachers.  The specific complaint
is that, under Italian law, working mothers are guaranteed 80 percent of their
salary for five months after birth, with employers paying the remaining 20
percent.  Italian universities pay the 20 percent for Italians, but not for
foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign language teachers in Italy are usually hired under private
contracts, which provide fewer protections and benefits than the public
contracts under which Italian teachers are hired.  The European Court of
Justice has twice ruled in favor of the teachers, and against the Italian
universities.</tt><p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC16">Asylum
Seekers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>After July 1, 1993, asylum seekers who passed through safe third
countries--all Germany's neighbors--en route to Germany could not file
applications for asylum in Germany, since they could have requested asylum in
the first safe country that they reached.  As one result, many asylum seekers
declared that they did not know how they got to Germany--they reported that
they were put in a truck container in Romania, and stepped out in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Lawyers for asylum seekers argued that, in such cases, asylum applicants
have the right to seek asylum in Germany unless the government can prove that
the asylum seeker in fact passed through a safe country en route to Germany.
This would have rendered the "safe third country" clause ineffective, since it
would have been very hard to prove exactly how any particular asylum seeker
reached Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 7, 1995, an administrative court in Berlin ruled that the
burden of proof is on the alien, not the government.  In other words, the
government can assume that the alien passed through a safe third country en
route to Germany if he or she arrived by land, even if the alien claims not to
know how he entered Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Lawyers began an appeal in the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on
November 21 in the case of five foreigners whose asylum appeals were rejected
because they arrived into Germany via safe third countries.  A ruling in the
case is not expected until February, 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>German courts ruled that civil wars are not sufficient grounds to prevent
the repatriation of individuals whose requests for political asylum have been
rejected. repatriating individuals whose requests for political asylum have
been rejected.  The Berlin-based Federal Administrative Court ruled in late
October that the "general dangers and consequences" of civil wars ought not
deter German immigration authorities from sending rejected asylum-seekers back
to their native lands - unless the individual faces "targeted inhumane
treatment" from the government in his/her native land or from a "state-like
authority" there.  </tt><p>
<tt>Rejected asylum seekers may not be returned home if the individual would
face "concrete, serious danger."  This ruling came in the case of a man seeking
refuge from the civil war in Afghanistan, who argued that bombing raids and
food shortages endangered his family.  The court ruled that the dangers of
civil war were not directed at him specifically, and therefore he did not have
an adequate basis for an asylum claim.  </tt><p>
<tt>The CDU proposed at the party conference that the Schengen accord be
extended to cover the rest of Europe.  The proposed additions would include,
former Eastern Bloc nations, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and
Malta. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in Germany increased slightly in October.  A
total of 12,389 people applied for asylum in October compared with 12,065 in
September--one third were from ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey.  The number of asylum
seekers is up for the first 10 months of 1995 compared with 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, about 31,000 foreigners were prevented from entering Germany,
mostly at Polish and Czech border crossings, down from 54,000 in 1993.  Between
January and July 1995, some 4500 aliens who arrived at Frankfurt airport were
prevented from entering Germany.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC17">Foreign
Workers in Construction</a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>The German cabinet on September 1, 1995 approved a proposal that would
require foreign firms sending workers to Germany to pay those foreign workers
at least as much as the minimum wage negotiated between German unions and
employers.  On November 30, Germany's Bundestag approved the proposal.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the equal pay law will not go into effect unless a wage commission
comprised of equal numbers of employer and union representatives approves.
Employers are reportedly reluctant to approve, since approval would, some fear,
open the door to a minimum wage.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU Social Affairs Council is scheduled to discuss similar EU proposals,
COM(91)230 and COM(93)225, on December 5, 1995, but EU member nations remain
deadlocked over whether local wages should be paid from day one, as Germany
insists, or after 10 to 30 days, as Ireland and Italy prefer.  France and
Belgium already require EU workers posted to France to earn at least French
wages from their first day in the country, the so-called zero option.</tt><p>
<tt>According to German unions, some construction firms, and the government,
equal pay for local and foreign workers would prevent workers on the same work
site from receiving different wages, and reduce the incentive of firms to
prefer foreign subcontractors and foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 150,000 foreign workers from EU nations such as Greece,
Portugal, and the UK at work on German construction sites, and 140,000
unemployed German construction workers.  With non-EU and illegal alien workers,
the German building union estimates that there are as many as 500,000 foreign
construction workers in Germany.  The Portuguese, many of whom live on-site in
mobile homes, earn about DM 8-10 per hour.  The Poles earn about DM 4 per hour,
while the British workers earn an hourly  wage comparable to the Germans of DM
30 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Construction workers in Germany have since 1959 received bad-weather money
(Schlechtwettergeld) between November and March.  Beginning in 1996,
construction workers will be guaranteed 75 percent of their gross pay, plus DM
2 per hour ($1.33) for each hour that they cannot work due to bad weather in
the winter months.  The payments are financed one-third by workers--who agree
to give up five vacation days--and two-thirds by employers, with some
government subsidy.</tt><p>
<tt>In an attempt to limit the number of foreign workers, a new regulation went
into force in 1995 that allows only two foreign cooks per restaurant.  German
labor officials would like restaurant owners to hire from the pool of
unemployed cooks.  State authorities are allowed to make exceptions and grant
additional work visas, but an establishment must prove that it needs additional
foreign chefs.  Chef visas are valid for three years.</tt><p>
<tt>Some efforts to encourage German employers to hire German workers have been
unsuccessful.  In January 1995, the German government ruled that non-German
workers on German ships could receive the wages prevailing in their home
nations.  This meant that mostly Indonesian and Filipino sailors are paid far
less than German sailors. </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-October, Chancellor Kohl lamented the demise of the work ethic,
charging that too many Germans are taking prosperity for granted.  Kohl would
like to reduce labor market regulations that allegedly keep the unemployment
rate at 9.2 percent, or 3.5 million. </tt><p>
<tt>Wolfgang Schaueble, the head of the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag,
said that Germans must lower their expectations.  According to Schaueble, up to
one million foreign workers are employed temporarily in Germany, suggesting
that there are jobs for some of the unemployed Germans.</tt><p>
<tt>German employers and unions are increasingly negotiating "secret" side
deals to industrywide employer-union agreements that reduce wages, usually by
arguing that the future of the company is at stake.  Germany's IG Metall union,
the world's largest, has declined from a unification peak of 3.7 million
members to three million, as workers ask what the union can do for them.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC18">Voting</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h3>
<tt>About 54,000 non-German nationals of EU states voted in municipal elections
in Berlin on October 22.  They had to be 18 or over, a resident of Berlin for
at least three months, and not barred from voting in their own country.
</tt><p>
<tt>Turks, many of whom have lived in Germany for many years, are reportedly
frustrated because they were barred from voting.  The right to vote in local
elections is included in the Maastricht treaty, but each country is allowed to
determine residency requirements.  For instance, the Netherlands and Denmark
require longer periods of residency.  The Spanish allow three nationalities to
vote, based on reciprocal arrangements.  </tt><p>
<tt>A 20-year Turkish resident of Germany has begun the German Democratic
Party, whose purpose is to obtain voting rights for long-term resident
foreigners.  The lawyer-founder of the party may not lead it--a majority of the
party members and its leadership must be German citizens.  The Greens and the
Social Democrats have supported voting rights for foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 12,500 Russians registered as living in Berlin, but the true
number is believed to be 40,000 or more.  Most are concentrated in the
Charlottenburg area, where it is believed that "hot money" seeking safe
investments is pushing up real estate prices.</tt><p>
<tt>Each German Land has an aliens' commissioner, and at their annual
conference in late October, the commissioners called for more public services
and public sector jobs for foreigners.  They noted that foreigners are, on
average, 16 percent of the populations of large German cities, but foreigners
hold only seven percent of public sector jobs in these cities, mostly as
janitors.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC19">Vietnamese
Repatriation</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>On November 14-17, Helmut Kohl, the first German chancellor to visit
Vietnam, began a 10-day, three-country tour of Asia to boost German investment
in the area.   One stumbling block to German investment in Vietnam has been the
disagreement between the two countries over the repatriation of Vietnamese in
Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>In July 1995, Germany and Vietnam agreed to return 40,000 Vietnamese, who
had been imported by East Germany as guest workers, and came after unification
illegally, over five years--the first 2,500 were to be returned in this year.
On November 17, during his Vietnamese trip, Kohl announced that the quota would
not be fulfilled this year because the agreement did not go into effect until
September 1995 and that there are problems with implementing their mass
deportation.   </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet set out new conditions for the
repatriation of Vietnamese living aboard.  The new conditions include
demonstrating that those returning do not have dual nationality, that they
lived in Vietnam, and that they were being sponsored by economic or social
organizations or individuals.  The new conditions are expected to further delay
the repatriation of Vietnamese from Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany must provide Vietnam with a list of who it plans to return, and
Vietnam must approve the list.  Some fear resistance and protests over what may
become forced deportations.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany agreed to provide up to $140 million to returning Vietnamese and
the Vietnam government.  There are believed to be 100,000 Vietnamese in
Germany, so that Germany will be left with a significant Vietnamese population
after the deportations.</tt><p>
<tt>After unification in 1990, Germany offered Vietnamese guest workers $2,000
and a ticket home, and an estimated 50,000 Vietnamese left.  Vietnam refused to
accept the Vietnamese who did not accept Germany's payment offer, and
Vietnamese who had been imported to work in other Eastern European countries
moved to Germany.  Germany granted these Vietnamese in the early 1990s two-year
residence permits if they had jobs and no criminal records.</tt><p>

<tt>Sweden is a country of six million that evolved from a country that
recruited guest workers (plus their families) and selected refugees for
resettlement to a country that, in the early 1990s, found that 90 percent of
its immigration was asylum-related.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1992, over 84,000 foreigners--80 percent from the ex-Yugoslavia--
applied for asylum in Sweden, and Sweden, which was relatively generous in
providing some form of Temporary Protected Status as well as welfare benefits,
discovered that costs of asylum-related costs were SEK 20 billion ($2.7
billion).  </tt><p>
<tt>Sweden responded by changing its immigration laws and procedures.  In
mid-1995, a Swedish Parliamentary committee released a report that, inter alia,
recommends that Sweden tighten immigration by restricting family unification to
children 18 or less (versus the current 20) to reduce the number of relatives
who join each recognized asylum seeker from the current eight to six.  </tt><p>
<tt>The committee also recommended that refugee status no longer be granted to
draft evaders from other countries, and that TPS be granted for a maximum two
years.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Swedish government plans to reduce the number of residency permits
granted in 1996 to about 9,200.  Nearly 36,500 people received residence
permits in 1993, and about 18,640 refugees and asylum-seekers applied for them
in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Scandinavian countries have offered to finance the resettlement of refugees
from the former Yugoslavia, if they settle in Hungary.  Hungary says it cannot
accommodate a large number of refugees, but has 1,500 vacant places for
refugees, but no money to care for them.  The Hungarian government has not
officially responded to the offer.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweden often epitomizes the welfare state, the notion that full employment
and social service programs will maintain incomes and narrow economic
differences by the government.  However, structural changes are threatening the
viability of an extensive welfare state operated by governments.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration may have contributed to popular calls for scaling back the
welfare state.  Unemployment insurance benefits, which were 90 percent of usual
pay, are now 75 percent.  Unemployment, which is eight percent among Swedes, is
21 percent for foreign nationals.  Few immigrants receive work permits. </tt><p>
<tt>Racial violence has broken out in communities with refugees.  More than 100
incidents of ethnic violence have been reported this year. </tt><p>
<tt>The small town of Orbyhus, 80 miles north of Stockholm, has become a symbol
of the xenophobia threatening Sweden.  Fifteen refugee families from Bosnia and
Kosovo have been the target of violence and intimidation.  Nightly vigils by
skinheads are held outside their homes.  The Orbyhus chief of police places
blame on the local council for "dumping" 20 or 30 refugees in a small town.
Most are moving to other parts of the country.</tt><p>
<tt>In a November 3 report, the UN human rights committee praised Sweden for
its human right record, but  expressed concern about the growing racism and
xenophobia in Swedish society.  The committee urged the Swedish government to
take "appropriate measures," to counter the trend.  The committee also
complained about the prolonged detentions of illegal immigrants and foreigners
awaiting deportation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Sweden's reputation for humanitarianism suffered a severe blow when the
European Commission for Human Rights intervened in mid-October to stop the
deportation of a one-year old girl to Peru.  The girl's mother was scheduled to
be deported with her, even though she has been declared unfit to care for the
child, who has been in state care since her birth.  </tt><p>
<tt>The case is complicated by the fact that the father of the child, a
Peruvian opposition member now in Sweden, abused and killed their first child.
The mother was denied asylum, and the father is now jail for the murder of the
first child. </tt><p>
<tt>The case has been front-page news for several weeks because several
international organizations are concerned that Sweden is violating the UN
Children's Convention by not protecting welfare of refugee children.  The child
rights' organization, Save the Children, has said that the children of
asylum-seekers are by law denied the same health and dental care as Swedish
children.  A bill scheduled for consideration in the Swedish Parliament this
year would provide refugee children the same benefits as Swedish
children.</tt><p>

Top Priority in

</a></h2>
<tt>Riots in several French suburbs after police killed a Moroccan man November
1 fleeing their custody prompted Prime Minister Juppe to hold a summit meeting
on how to integrate especially immigrant youth in French suburbs and avoid
"US-style urban violence."  Funds to create an additional 100,000 jobs over
three years were promised.</tt><p>
<tt>A day after a cabinet reshuffle on November 7, France's Interior Minister
told the National Assembly that immigration was a top government priority.  The
government announced that it will not call for a suspension of immigration, but
will continue to impose strict limits on the number of immigrants allowed into
the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>The leader of the far right, Jean-Marie Le Pen, at a November 11 National
Front rally, told his supporters that he is not a racist; "we prefer the
French, but we don't hate foreigners." </tt><p>
<tt>Le Pen criticized several National Front mayors in early November for not
carrying out his policies regarding immigrants.  Le Pen had hoped that the
mayors of Orange, Toulon and Marignae would become showcases for his policy of
"national preference," giving priority to French nationals for housing, jobs
and welfare.  </tt><p>
<tt>The National Front mayors have not been able to practice "national
preference" because such policies are racially discriminatory and therefore
illegal in France.  After the meeting, Le Pen announced that the mayors would
not make grants to groups and associations that favored immigrants, and that
there would be more rigorous checks carried out on foreigners applying for
state benefits in these cities.  It was unclear what action, if any, the mayors
would take once they returned to their cities. </tt><p>
<tt>At the same time, it was revealed that Le Pen's daughter, a lawyer and
National Front member, was in court trying to keep an Algerian from being
deported.  Le Pen's daughter argued in court that the Algerian had lived in
France since he was one year old, and "felt in his heart that he was a
Frenchman and would feel like a foreigner in Algeria."  She defended her
handling of the case, saying that though the National Front is opposed to
France's immigration policies, it is not against individual rights. </tt><p>

<tt>A new study by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development
concludes that the cost of caring for refugees and asylum-seekers averaged
about $10,000 per person per year in the four Scandinavian countries.  Sweden
accounted for almost half of the $2.5 billion spent to care for the average
262,000 foreigners in these countries for the equivalent of 12 months in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The average costs of caring for asylum seekers in Scandinavian countries
were more than twice the $4,000-$4,500 average in Switzerland and Austria.
Sweden spent an average $10,000 per year to care for an average 64,000 asylum
seekers or persons granted humanitarian status or TPS, while Switzerland spent
an average $4,500 on an average 121,000 asylum seekers and refugees in its
system in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The costs of processing asylum seekers and refugees is typically less than
10 percent of the overall costs of the asylum-refugee system.  The major factor
in the cost estimates is the number of persons who depend on public assistance,
either because they do not or are not allowed to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the asylum costs are associated not with the selection and
resettlement of refugees recognized under the Geneva convention of 1951, which
defined refugees as persons unable or unwilling to return to their countries of
citizenship because of a well-founded fear of political persecution.  </tt><p>
<tt>Instead, most of the costs are incurred to care for non-Geneva convention
foreigners who are granted Temporary Protected Status, or whose applications
for asylum are rejected, but not returned to their countries of citizenship.
For example, as of December 31, 1994, there were some 282,000 foreigners in
Germany whose applications for asylum had been rejected, but who had yet to be
deported, including Kurds who some German states refuse to deport.</tt><p>
<tt>In many European countries, the cost of operating the asylum and refugee
system has been stable or rising, even though the number of new applications
for asylum has been falling.  For example, the number of asylum applications in
Germany fell from over 400,000 in 1992 to less than 200,000 in 1994, but the
cost of operating the German asylum system rose to an estimated $10 billion in
1993.  Costs seem to have fallen to $8 billion in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The chief of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that the UNHCR is
challenged because of a worldwide decline in asylum rights.  Refugees now face
many closed borders because of an increased weariness about the large number of
asylum seekers seeking sanctuary. </tt><p>
<tt>Some experts say that the tougher anti-asylum legislation throughout Europe
has meant that asylum-seekers have had to depend upon professional smugglers
who often force them into crime and prostitution.</tt><p>

<tt>A referendum, Article 69, which would restrict the number of foreigners
allowed to live in Switzerland, gathered enough signatures to force a popular
vote.  The proposal would create a constitutional clause limiting non-Swiss
nationals to 18 percent of the population, down from the current level of 19
percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Under Swiss law, the government has until August 1997 to present its views
and compromise with the proposal's authors.  Another one or two years could
then pass before the referendum is actually held. </tt><p>
<tt>The proposal would cover foreign workers and their families, who currently
make up 18.8 percent of the seven million residents of Switzerland.  If asylum
seekers and those fleeing war are included in the figure, the proposed maximum
would be already exceeded, effectively ending immigration to Switzerland.
</tt><p>
<tt>Official figures show 62.5 percent of non-Swiss residents come from western
and southern Europe, and 21.9 percent from ex-Yugoslavia.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 22 elections, the anti-immigrant parties, anti-European
conservatives, and socialists made gains.  The Swiss People's Party (UDC) of
businessman Christopher Blocker ran a campaign based on a platform of
Eurosceptism and anti-immigration.  The UDC received about 30 seats. </tt><p>
<tt>Last year Swiss voters approved increasing police powers to crack down on
asylum-seekers and illegal foreigners.  In June, they rejected a government
proposal to make it easier for foreigners to buy property in Switzerland.
</tt><p>
<tt>Switzerland is not an EU member, but it is a member of the European
Economic Area, and the EU negotiating a seven part agreement that the Swiss
government hopes will put Switzerland back on the path to EU membership.  The
EU is demanding, and Switzerland is resisting, a proposal that EU citizens have
the right to look for work for up to three months in Switzerland and, if
offered a job, have the right to any necessary work and residence
permits.</tt><p>
<tt>The Swiss are reportedly resisting changes to their current policy, which
distributes a quota of work permits by sector and nationality each year on a
canton-by-canton basis.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Labor
Exporters Plan for
Emigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Indonesia plans to increase the number of Indonesians working abroad from
the current 1.2 million to two million by year 2000, when they are expected to
remit $12 billion annually.  Indonesia would like its migrants to earn at least
$500 per month, which implies that more skilled and professionals, and fewer
maids, will be sent abroad.  Indonesia has upgraded some of its vocational
schools to train workers for foreign labor markets.</tt><p>
<tt>Indonesia plans to post more labor attaches overseas to protect its migrant
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Bangladesh officials worried in mid-October that increasing illegal
emigration to Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and South Korea may encourage these
nations to restrict the employment of Bangladeshis, and thus threaten the $1.5
billion Bangladesh earns annually in remittances-- Bangladesh earned $911
million in remittances during the first nine months of 1995.  Some 156,000
Bangladeshi workers were deployed abroad in the first 10 months of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt> Saudi Arabia is Bangladesh's largest foreign labor market, accounting for
nearly 720,000 of the 1.6 million Bangladeshis working abroad, and Saudi Arabia
has said that over 40,000 illegal Bangladeshis in the country should be
deported.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 70,000 illegal Bangladeshis in Malaysia, plus
161,000 with valid work permits, and South Korea recently ordered 5,500 illegal
Bangladeshis to leave or face deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Government officials blamed Bangladeshi labor agents for collecting fees
and issuing forged documents to Bangladeshi workers eager for jobs
abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines would also like to upgrade the skills of the migrant
workers that it sends abroad, both to increase remittances, and to prevent
exploitation.  There are about 25 million Filipinos employed in the
Philippines, and two to four million employed abroad. </tt><p>
<tt>There has been a continuing public outcry over the conditions that Filipina
maids sometimes experience abroad.  In July 1995, the Philippines announced
that women would not longer be allowed to emigrate legally to work as maids in
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, and
that maids already employed there would have to return within five years.  The
Philippines also announced a phase-out on the migration of entertainers to
Cyprus, Greece and Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines Overseas Employment Administration may have trouble
enforcing these bans on sending maids to certain countries.  The POEA admits,
for example, that Filipino nurses enter Jordan as $200 per month maids, but
then go to work as nurses.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines officially argues that exporting workers is a transitional
policy that will stop as per capita incomes rise.  However, most analysts note
that the Philippines has been unable to create manufacturing jobs for
ex-farmers--about 28 million Filipinos are considered to be poor, and
two-thirds of them live in rural areas--and new labor force entrants.  By some
estimates, one in three Filipino households has or had a member employed
abroad.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the meantime, the culture of emigration that is taking root in the
Philippines has led, some argue, to a rupturing the social fabric by breaking
down traditions of kinship and community.  The Philippine sense of self-worth
is believed to be eroding, as Filipina women abroad are viewed as either maids
or entertainers.  Some studies show that relatively few returned Filipino
workers are able to maintain the improved lifestyle that their remittances made
possible, encouraging some to attempt to re-emigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>In some villages, five to 10 percent of the population is abroad, that
practically everyone knows a migrant worker.  A 1989 census of Pozorrubio, for
example, found 3,500 overseas workers -- nearly all of them women--from a city
of 49,000.  Almost 60 per cent of the 258,984 Overseas Contract Workers OCWs
sent abroad in 1994 were female.  Some 153,000 Filipinos--of 300,000 on
available to go-- are employed on ships around the world, often at salaries of
about $300 per month.  The Philippines is the largest supplier of seafarers to
world shipping. </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Filipino women going abroad to work as maids are college
graduates, with degrees in everything from chemical engineering to nursing, who
are escaping low wages and limited opportunities, and sometimes failing
marriages.  Stints abroad that were planned to last for one or two years have,
in some cases, turned into ten-year jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration (IOM)
of 170 Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong recommended that the Philippines
do a better job of encouraging the countries in which its nationals work to
enforce their labor laws. The Philippines both promotes labor exports and
attempts to protect its workers overseas, goals that sometimes conflict with
one another.</tt><p>
<tt>The report urged the government to form coalitions with other labor
exporters to remind labor importers of the benefits of migrant workers, and to
press collectively for better conditions, especially for maids.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines GDP is growing at a 5.5 percent rate, and this rate is
expected to climb to six percent or more in 1996 and 1997.  However, the
Philippines has very low domestic savings, and high domestic and foreign
debts.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines Department of Labor and Employment announced that it has
about 250 inspectors to police the nation's 400,000 workplaces.  Some 35,000 of
67,000 workplaces inspected in the first nine months were in violation of labor
laws, usually minimum wage, 13th month pay, and social security payment
obligations.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam's Department for Labor Management Abroad announced that it plans to
send 100,000 workers abroad annually to relieve unemployment pressures.  There
are currently about 15,000 Vietnamese contract workers abroad, and 20,000 are
expected to be deployed in 1995, mostly to in South Korea, Libya and the
Persian Gulf.</tt><p>
<tt>China has at least 270,000 contract workers employed abroad, 60 percent in
Asia, and some hope that overseas employment will be a safety valve as China
privatizes state-owned enterprises that once guaranteed lifetime employment.
According to Chinese officials, China will earn $7.5 billion from labor exports
in 1995, up from $5 billion in 1994--China includes the total value of
Chinese-supplied goods for e.g. construction projects abroad as well as wages
in these estimates.</tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 50 to 100 million internal migrants looking for jobs
within China, a number estimated to rise to 200 to 300 million by 2000.  China
recently began to promote the export of contract workers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC26">Taiwan
To Import More Foreign
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Despite concerns about the social impacts of foreign workers, the Taiwan
government plans to allow 30,000 more foreign workers to fill manufacturing
jobs by the end of 1995.  It will be the largest additional increment of
foreign workers to be approved by the Council of Labour Affairs since Taiwan
permitted the legal entry of foreign workers in 1991.  </tt><p>
<tt>On November 23, 1995, the CLA announced that the number of foreign workers
to be admitted to the country would fluctuate with the unemployment rate.
Current regulations limit the number of foreign workers to 35 percent of the
number of Taiwanese workers in the labor insurance program.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a recent poll, 75 percent of Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
business owners cannot find enough workers.  However, Taiwan's unemployment
rate hit two percent in September, 1995, the second-highest rate in 10 years.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs reportedly favors the free entry of  foreign
workers, while the Council of Labor Affairs wants to preserve strict controls
over the number of foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 4,000 illegal foreign workers were arrested between September 1 and
October 25 in a nationwide crackdown.  Most of the illegal workers are detained
in the Sanhsia detention center or in police holding cells until they are
repatriated.  The names of over 1,000 employers who illegally hired foreign
workers, and 49 agents accused of smuggling aliens into Taiwan, were turned
over to the district prosecutors.  There are an estimated 32,000 illegal
workers in Taiwan, including 11,000 who have abandoned jobs with the employers
who recruited them.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is concerned about foreign workers using the pretext of entering the
country to study Chinese.  There are 5,000 to 6,000 foreigners studying Chinese
in Taiwan, and they are permitted to apply for work permits that allow up to 12
hours of work each week.  However, only 30 such permits have been issued;
leading to suspicions that many foreign students are working illegally. </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan began to import foreign workers legally in October 1989, when
employers requested 65,000 foreign workers to work on high-priority national
infrastructure projects.  Labor costs had risen sharply as Taiwan's currency
appreciated in value.  The government permitted almost 44,000 foreign
construction workers to enter Taiwan.  In October 1991, an additional 10,000
foreign workers were approved.</tt><p>
<tt>The legal basis for importing foreign workers into Taiwan was established
in May 1992, and approvals of almost 13,000 maids, 175 health care providers,
2,000 fishing boat workers, and 27,000 foreign workers for other industries
followed in the next four months.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign workers, and the industries in which they are
permitted to work, has expanded steadily ever since--the CLA has granted
approval for some 270,000 foreign workers to work in Taiwan, and 193,100 are
currently in the country--131,000 from Thailand, 54,800 from the Philippines,
5,100 from Indonesia and 2,200 from Malaysia.  There are also about 8,000
foreign maids, mostly from the Philippines.  In mid-November, Taiwan began
radio broadcasts for Thai and Philippine workers to help ease social isolation.
The broadcasts include news and popular music in Thai, English and Tagalog.
</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan limits the number of foreign workers admitted, so that the number of
employer requests for foreign workers is at least twice the number approved for
admission.  In November, 1995, several officials in Taiwan's Council of Labour
Affairs were accused of accepting bribes to approve employer requests for
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to obtain approval to employ foreign workers, employers must
advertise for local workers, prepare a plan to increase productivity, and offer
an orientation program for the foreign workers.  There are more than 100
agents--with names like Top International Manpower--that provide these services
to Taiwanese employers.</tt><p>
<tt>These agents typically have connections to a labor recruiter in the
Philippines or Thailand who recruit workers there, and they compete in Taiwan
to provide a package of services to Taiwan employers.  For example, a typical
agent's offering is to request a NT$25,000 (about US$1000) one-time fee to
cover recruitment costs, visa and other fees, and round-trip transportation to
Taiwan.  Employer's then pay the foreign workers Taiwan's minimum wage of
NT$14,880 per month, plus NT$2100 in government fees that are used to train
local workers, and NT$867 for workers' compensation coverage, or NT$17,847 per
month (about $700).</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers receive individual two-year contract; a TYPICAL CONTRACT (a
copy is available on the Migration News Home Page) includes a 40-day probation,
specifies an eight-hour, six-day work week, employer-provided housing and meals
at no charge, seven days paid leave after one year, and lists ten reasons for
terminating the contract, including getting married in Taiwan or acting against
the public order.</tt><p>
<tt>In early November, several CLA officials were charged with accepting bribes
of NT$ 3,000 for each foreign worker they approved from labor brokers.  Agents
also negotiate their fees; they can reduce or waive recruitment fees and travel
costs, for example, knowing that foreign workers can be induced to pay partner
agents in the Philippines  or Thailand for the privilege of working abroad.
The Chinese National Federation of Industries, the largest manufacturing
organization, says that the bribery cases reflect the outdated regulations of
the CLA.  The council blames the bribery scandal on a lack of manpower to
handle the applications for foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>A typical foreign worker in Taiwan will earn about $600 monthly at the
minimum wage, or $7,200 annually.  Many workers pay agents in their home
country 20 to 30 percent of their first year's wage to find them an overseas
job, or $1,800. </tt><p>
<tt>About 2.5 million Taiwanese work in manufacturing, about the same as in
1985.  Even high-tech firms in the Hsinchu industrial park are having trouble
recruiting workers--2,000 of the park's 36,000 workers are Filipinos.  There is
a limit of 30 percent on the number of foreign, blue-collar workers at each
company, a stricter limit than the 30 percent of a total company's work force
that can be foreign in other factories.</tt><p>
<tt>Labor migration in Taiwan and throughout Asia is distinguished by this
significant wedge between what an employer pays for foreign workers, and what
the worker receives.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the US, Mexican workers pay $300 to $500 to be smuggled into the US.  If
they work seasonally, earning $5 hourly for 1,000 hours, or $5,000, the cost of
getting to the job site is equivalent to 10 percent of their earnings.  But US
employers rarely pay for workers housing and meals; these costs can easily be
$50 per week, reducing a $200 weekly wage to $150, so that smuggling fees of,
say, $400, plus living costs of $50 per week for 25 weeks ($1475), can make the
costs of working illegally in the US equivalent to almost 40 percent of the
worker's earnings.  </tt><p>
<tt>Costs decline as wages rise and workers stay longer; a Mexican worker
employed full-time at $5 hourly earns $10,000, so that smuggling and living
costs of $500 plus 50 weeks times $50 make the cost of working in the US
equivalent to 30 percent of the worker's earnings. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in the US, and guest workers in Europe, used to keep more
of their earnings.  Under the US Bracero and European guest worker programs,
workers sometimes paid bribes to be selected to work abroad, but employers paid
transportation and other costs associated with getting to the job, as well as
living expenses.</tt><p>
<tt>Many foreign workers in Taiwan are employed in construction for over 190
hours each month.  According to a recent survey, the average monthly wage paid
in Taiwan's construction sector was NT$ 41,994 in April 1995, and the average
daily wage was NT$ 2,089.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is a country of 21 million with a labor force in 1994 of 9.1
million.  About 12 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture, but
75 percent of Taiwan's farmers and farm workers are expected to be displaced by
2005 because of Taiwan's 1996 World Trade Organization entry, which will force
the country to open itself to imported food. </tt><p>

<tt>There were 1.4 million foreign residents of Japan at the end of 1994, the
most ever recorded, and almost double the 800,000 in 1974.  As in the past,
almost 700,000 or half of the foreign residents in Japan were Koreans, followed
by about 200,000 Chinese and 150,000 Brazilians.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 106,000 foreigners with work permits in 1994, including 35,000
entertainers, 25,000 foreigners employed in humanities and international
relations, and 5,800 intra-company transfers.  The number of foreigners with
work permits exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of 1994, there were 61,500 foreign students in Japan, including
10,300 who arrived in 1994.  Of those arriving in 1994, about 26 percent were
from China, 22 percent from South Korea, and 12 percent from the US.  About
2400 foreign students who graduated from Japanese universities in 1994 were
hired by Japanese companies.</tt><p>
<tt>For the first time, Japan employed foreigners to help take the national
census.  About half of the one million foreigners living in Japan are Koreans,
and the cities of Tokyo and Osaka requested foreigners to help enumerate
residents in their cities.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 3,527 foreigners were deported in September and October 1995 for
violating Japanese immigration laws, including 812 Koreans, 538 Chinese, and
435 Thais.  Many foreigners caught working in Japan are sentenced to 18 months
in jail, but granted suspended sentences and deported-- under Japanese
immigration law, foreigners who have been sentenced to prison terms of over one
year are denied reentry.  According to one report, the number of illegal
foreigners in Japan dropped from 300,000 in May 1993 to 12,000 in May
1995.</tt><p>

<tt>The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers has completed its proposed law on
the recruitment and protection of foreign workers and it has been finalized by
the Attorney General.  The new guidelines are expected to permit local
employers to undertake direct recruitment of foreign workers in Thailand,
Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government doubled the levy on foreign workers effective
January 1996.  The increase in levies--aimed at encouraging Malaysian employers
to reduce their dependence on foreign workers-- is expected to generate an
additional M$ 215 million--some M$300 million in levies was collected between
September 1992 and December 1993.  Employers must pay a monthly levy for all
foreign workers; the levy ranges from M$100 PTKs to M$200 senior management to
M$35 for an unskilled manufacturing and construction workers. The monthly levy
on foreign maids is M$30, and for agricultural workers, the levy ranges from
M$25 to M$60.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 553,658 registered foreign workers in the country in 1995, of
whom 252,877 were Indonesians, 82,796 Bangladeshis, 26,602 Filipinos, and
21,965 Thais.  However, the number of illegal workers is widely believed to
exceed the number of registered workers, bringing the total to over one
million.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, there were about 81,000 foreign maids in Malaysia, 125,000
foreign farm workers, 123,000 foreign construction workers, 45,000 foreign
manufacturing workers, and 10,000 foreigners in other sectors.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Labor Minister warned employers in mid-October that they
would not be allowed to recruit foreign workers until after they had made
honest efforts to find local workers.  The minister urged employers to raise
wages, and to establish workplace nurseries, to attract Malaysian women
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Labor Minister said on September 24 that foreign workers are not
allowed to join unions because they are living in the country on the temporary
basis.  He also added that there are sufficient labor laws to protect them from
exploitation.  He added that if foreign workers were permitted to join unions
it might make local workers unhappy.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Electrical Industry Workers Union and the Malaysian Trade
Union Congress have said that the immigration department is breaking trade
union laws by not allowing foreign workers to join unions. </tt><p>
<tt>It has been reported that thousands of Bangladeshis are trying to register
themselves to work in Malaysia following a report that the Bangladesh
government will punish those who illegally look for work in Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt>Indonesia, which has over 500,000 workers in Malaysia, has announced that
in the future it will only allow skilled workers in agriculture, industries,
construction, services and transport to work in Malaysia.  The two countries
have still not signed an agreement on the new procedures for the recruitment of
Indonesian workers in Malaysia.  The signing of an agreement has been delayed
due to an Indonesian demand that maids be paid a minimum wage of M$1,800.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Sabah state government announced that it is considering an amnesty for
the more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in Sabah.  Under the proposal, illegal
foreign workers would be offered work permits.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is in the midst of a debate over whether the unskilled foreign
workers who increasingly staff its plantations, construction sites, factories,
and homes are an asset or liability.  On the one hand, it is clear that the
foreigners find jobs, earn incomes, and spend much of what they earn, both on
local goods, on transport, banking, and other services, and some of their
remittances are spent on imported Malaysian goods.</tt><p>
<tt>On the other hand, it is also clear that most of the foreign workers in
Malaysia are unskilled workers, and that Malaysia's goal of being an
industrialized country by 2020 may be threatened if the presence of many
unskilled workers keeps the country on a low-skill, low-tech trajectory.</tt><p>

<tt>The Singapore Parliament approved on November 1, 1995 an Employment of
Foreign Workers Act to deter the employment of illegal alien workers in
construction.  Under the act, employers who hire illegal workers will be fined
up to S$ 15,000 to S$30,000, and jailed up to 12 months.  Repeat offenders can
face double penalties.  These penalties can be extended to shipyards and
factories by the labor ministry.</tt><p>
<tt>If illegal workers are discovered at construction sites, the burden of
proof shifts to the primary employer to show that he did not know they were
present or illegal.  If more than five illegal workers are discovered, the
employer can be caned, or fined S$50,000 to S$100,000.  Primary employers at
work sites can escape the penalties if they can prove that they checked the
workers' papers, and restricted access to the site with e.g., fences, guards,
and IDs.</tt><p>
<tt>An average 31 employers each month of 1994 were found to be employing an
average 37 illegal alien workers.  Some 10,000 illegal workers were apprehended
in 1994, double the number caught in 1988.  Most of the illegal workers were
apprehended at construction sites; e.g., a late November raid found 178 illegal
foreign workers, including 143 with no documents.</tt><p>
<tt>The construction industry opposed the new law.  Construction
representatives point out that fencing is impractical at some sites, such as
road construction. </tt><p>
<tt>In November, two men were jailed for inducing the Work Permit and
Employment Department to issue a permit by falsely stating an foreign worker
applicant did not have Aids.  All foreign workers in Singapore must be
certified Aids-free.</tt><p>

<tt>On October 31, the Thai Labour and Social Welfare secretary called for a
clear<b> </b>policy on foreign workers.  The ministry currently does not have
the power to import unskilled labor, despite shortages. </tt><p>
<tt>In September 1994, Thailand's National Security Council estimated that
there were 525,000 illegal aliens in the country, two-thirds of whom are from
Burma.  By the end of 1994, the number of Burmese had increased at least 10
percent, bringing the total to 600,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most illegal immigrants in Thailand work in farming, fishing, construction,
and footwear and textile factories.  Most Thai employers pay migrants 30 to 50
percent less than Thai employees.  The Thai minimum wage is 145 baht
daily.</tt><p>
<tt>According to some estimates, there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Burmese
working in the southwest Thai province of Ranong.</tt><p>
<tt>In one province of Thailand, businesses hiring Burmese immigrants must
register their names with the local government and pay guarantee money of 5,000
baht ($200) for each worker.  The Thai employers had to register all foreign
workers by September 21, 1995.  The deadline was extended one month because
only one in four employers had deposited the guarantee money.  Some employers
have demanded that the Burmese immigrants pay the 5,000 baht guarantee
money.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Burmese working illegally in the northwestern city of Tak have
left because of the fear of being arrested.  As a result, several manufacturers
are considering moving out to an area where more labor and infrastructure is
more available. </tt><p>
<tt>According to some observers, the demand for unskilled immigrant workers
increased after 1993, when Thailand extended mandatory education from six to
nine years (about age 15), with nationwide enforcement scheduled by 1997.
About 15 percent of the 1.5 million workers employed in the textile industry
are expected to disappear because they are in school.  Some textile factories
are automating, and others are moving to border provinces, where illegal
workers are more available.</tt><p>
<tt>Bangkok has become one of the major transit points for foreigners trying to
illegally enter the US.  US government officials in Thailand estimated that
2,000 people per month try to leave Thailand for the US.  Most use false papers
or lie to get Thai passports and US visas, some travel without papers.  The US
government says that only 20 percent of the 2,000 are Thais, the rest are
Chinese, Indians, Bangladeshis and others using Thailand as a starting point to
the West.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai police in November 1995 arrested in Bangkok a native of Taiwan who is
believed to have arranged for the smuggling of 300 Chinese aliens on the Golden
Venture, the ship that ran aground in New York in 1993.  As the case unfolds,
it appears that "investors" collected $30,000 each from migrants and their
families in Fujian province, and hired the Taiwanese man arrested as a contract
smuggler.</tt><p>

<tt>Britain will accept Chinese demands to stop granting Hong Kong permanent
residency to returning migrants after July 1, 1997.  This is in major change in
Britain's previous position, that Hong Kong emigrants should be unconditionally
offered permanent residency if they return after 1997.  London hopes that by
making this concession, it can secure China's consent on other arrangements
contained in a residency package aimed at enabling the return of
emigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 300,000 foreign workers in Hong Kong, and the unemployment
rate is expected to remain at 3.5 percent in 1995, the highest rate in 13
years.  The government announced plans to reduce the number of foreign workers
admitted.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 300,000 foreign workers in Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>In an unprecedented migration, the remains of thousands of Hong Kong dead
are being dug up and shipped to California.  Hong Kong's Chinese worry that
when the mainland Chinese take over in 1997 they will build over the
territory's cemeteries.  Ironically, San Francisco's Chinese community used to
send their dead back to China.   </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong is racing to finish its new airport by June 30, 1997, when China
takes over Hong Kong's government.  In October 1995, about 20 percent of the
18,200 airport construction workers were foreigners.  Minimum wages are $1,280
per month, but many workers complain that contractors and subcontractors take
some of their salaries in illegal charges.</tt><p>

<tt>Saudi Arabia's five-year plan for 1995-2000 aims to eliminate foreign
workers in the public sector, including civil aviation, social security and
social insurance.  Foreigners are currently about 70 percent of the labor
force. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the 500,000 Saudis expected to find jobs in the next five years are
expected to be employed by private employers.  However, Saudis reportedly
prefer public sector jobs, where pay and benefits are better.  Saudi employers
reportedly prefer foreigners because they have higher productivity, high skills
and experience, and the cost of recruiting them is lower.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1985, Saudi Arabia announced plans to substitute 600,000 Saudis for
local workers, but, by 1990, there were 275,000 more foreigners were
employed.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bahraini government is studying a plan to allow foreign workers who
have left the country to return after one year to work for another employer
without requiring a no objection certificate from the previous employer.  The
plan would also facilitate the identification of foreigners who have overstayed
their residency permits.  The new regulations are expected to take effect
before the end of the year.</tt><p>
<tt>A three-and-a-half-month amnesty program in Bahrain resulted in 9,250
foreign workers legalizing their residency in the country.  Under the amnesty,
people who have stayed in Bahrain illegally after their residence permits have
expired were granted exemption from fines.  The sponsors of illegal immigrants
who did not regularize their stay will be fined.  Some employers would give
foreigners their passports so that they could legalize their residency. </tt><p>
<tt>A member of the Kuwaiti parliament said the country should make it easier
for foreign workers to bring in their families to boost the economy and help
stabilize the country's male-dominated expatriate community.  Nearly one
million of Kuwait's 1.8 million population are foreign guest workers, most of
them men from Egypt and Asia.  Most do not bring in family or keep their
financial assets in the country because of the strict residency rules
introduced after the 1991 Gulf War to reduce the country's reliance on foreign
workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwaiti merchants complain that this policy has significantly reduce the
amount the foreign workers spend in Kuwait. </tt><p>
<tt>Earlier this year the government abandoned a minimum salary rule and
decided to charge foreigners $200 for every dependent they brought into the
country.  An August law passed by Parliament abolished all new fees imposed in
1995 for state services so in late September the government halted the
collection of the flat fee and reinstated the minimum salary.  The new rule
requires that foreigners in the private sector who want to bring in their
families mush earn a minimum of $2,155 a month and those in the public sector
must earn a minimum of $1,500.  Most foreigner workers earn less than
that.</tt><p>

<tt>Environmental changes such as land degradation are, according to one UN
agency prediction, expected to displace over 135 million rural people from the
land, making them "environmental refugees."  A November 14, 1995 meeting in San
Francisco reviewed the extent to which land degradation is contributing to
legal and illegal Mexico to US migration.</tt><p>
<tt>There is no doubt that many of Mexico's agricultural resources such as land
and water have deteriorated over the past two decades, but it is very hard to
distinguish between the effects of such long-run trends and the results of
short-run variables that encourage migration.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, rural Mexicans are reducing their dependence on farming
non-irrigated lands.  Some households reduce their dependence on farming by
earning other income.  Nonfarm income can be generated by having one or more
household members migrate seasonally to the US, or within Mexico, or having the
entire household leave the rural area where it is established.</tt><p>
<tt>Most economists believe that individuals and households change their
behavior in response to price changes.  If land degradation makes the land less
productive, and if agricultural policy reform, plus trade agreements that
promise different prices, change the outlook for particular crops, then land
and crop prices will change, and rural households will respond, in part by
migrating.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico made changes in the 1990s that altered prices in rural Mexico in a
manner that signaled rural Mexicans to get out of agriculture.  Mexico freed up
the land market, reduced agricultural subsidies, and signed NAFTA--steps that
will probably cause the price of crop land used to grow field crops, such as
corn in non-irrigated areas, to fall, and the value of irrigated land used to
produce avocados or vegetables to rise.</tt><p>
<tt>In areas where land prices fall, some people will respond by selling or
abandoning land and migrating to urban areas in Mexico or to the US.  There are
several ways to counter such migration--raise prices in order to keep people on
the land, or make investments to reverse land degradation.  In today's Mexico,
it would appear easier to raise prices than to obtain the funds needed for
improving land quality.</tt><p>

displaced from their homes.  Some 14.4 million persons are considered refugees,
down from 18.2 million in 1993, which means that they are outside their country
of citizenship, and unable to return for fear of political persecution.
Another 36 million persons have been displaced from their homes, but remain
inside their country--they are not considered refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>A UNHCR report released on November 23 criticized European countries
detaining asylum-seekers.  The report said countries were holding asylum

airport transit zones while the awaiting a decision on their claim for
asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>The report recognized that some migrants were using the asylum process to
seek economic or other opportunities in Europe, but asked countries to make a
