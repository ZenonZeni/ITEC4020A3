</P>
<HR>
<H2>Faculty Research Profiles  
</H2>
<P>The opportunities for experiences in various laboratories and research
programs of faculty and staff in the Marine Science Institute and the Department
of Marine Science are described below.  Each section is written by a faculty
member  who had active undergraduate participation in the past.  They describe
the thrust of their programs and specific experience.
</P>
<H3>
Marine Chemistry - Dr. E. Ingall 
</H3>
<P>The flux of constituents to and from marine sediments exerts a strong
control on the composition of the oceans.  These fluxes are largely determined
by the chemical, physical and biological transformations that occur in sediments
shortly after deposition of a particle at the sediment-water interface.  My
research focuses on understanding these transformations by looking at trends in
sediment pore water and solid phase chemistry and by directly measuring sediment
fluxes.  An undergraduate student working in my lab would be exposed to the
various analytical techniques needed to characterize the chemistry of marine
sediments and waters.  The student will then apply these techniques to a small
research project where they will gather and interpret the data and present the
results.  For example, the REU student, who worked in my lab last year,
completed a project on the burial and preservation of the important nutrient
phosphorus in sediments from the Black Sea.  This work resulted in the
publication of an abstract for 1994 Fall American Geophysical Union meeting. 
</P>
<H3>Nutrient Chemistry and Phytoplankton Ecology - Dr. T. Whitledge
</H3>
<P>
Research experience for undergraduate students in my laboratory and field
studies concern the interaction of nutrient distributions and dynamics with
phytoplankton in Texas bays and estuaries and the Gulf of Mexico shelf. These 
studies investigate the effect of freshwater inflow on the nutrient availability
 and phytoplankton production in Texas estuaries.  This is a continuing project 
which was started in 1986 that is investigating the biological effects of 
nutrient inputs from the rivers in terms of phytoplankton production and
nutrient  regeneration processes.  Monthly surveys and biological productivity
measurements  have been conducted for the past six years during periods of
variable natural  inflows and freshwater releases from dams. Extensive
opportunities exist for  students to participate in both field and laboratory
work.   Other research  opportunities will be the effect of a persistent brown
tide bloom in Laguna Madre.  This project is investigating the hydrographic,
nutrient and phytoplankton growth relationships which prevail to maintain a
dense bloom of brown algae sp. in the Laguna Madre for the past three years. 
Monthly surveys and phytoplankton productivity studies have investigated the
role of nutrient enrichment processes in the maintenance of the phytoplankton
bloom conditions throughout the seasonal and annual cycles.    
</P>
<H3>Marine Botany - Dr. K. Dunton 
</H3>
<P>Undergraduate students have participated in a variety of projects in Dr.
Dunton's laboratory for the past six years.  Research activities are related to
field and laboratory studies on seagrasses, emergent vascular plants and marine
algae.  The students are often paired with either a post-doctoral or graduate
student under Dr. Dunton's supervision.  This provides the student an
opportunity to work alongside another young researcher and develop the project
he/she wishes to pursue.  Students are expected to develop their project to
address a particular question or hypothesis and are encouraged to participate
directly in the collection of samples and their analysis.  Specific techniques
that students have learned in my laboratory include the measurement of
photosynthesis in marine plants using oxygen electrodes to construct models of
plant production.  These measurements employ a variety of equipment, since the
approach involves both laboratory and field incubations.  Other projects are
more field oriented and involve making measurements related to the production
ecology of seagrasses or marsh vegetation (growth, biomass, sediment and water
column nutrient concentrations, etc.).  Still others have included work with
arctic kelp to examine nutrient effects on growth, nutrient uptake rates, etc. 
The diversity of on-going studies have always provided a stimulating atmosphere
for undergraduate students in this lab.   
</P>
<H3>Zooplankton Ecology - Dr. E. Buskey 
</H3>
<P>Research experiences for undergraduates in my laboratory would include
learning techniques for culturing marine phytoplankton and zooplankton, and
studying aspects of their feeding, growth and in the case of some dinoflagellate
species, their bioluminescence. We keep approximately 20 species of
phytoplankton in continuous culture, and use these species for culturing a
variety of protozoan and metazoan zooplankton species, including heterotrophic
dinoflagellates, ciliates and copepods. Protozoan species are isolated from
local waters and brought into continuous culture for study. We study their
feeding and growth under controlled laboratory conditions, and employ modern
staining techniques and epifluorescent microscopy for sample enumeration.
Studies presently underway include investigation of the effects of a nuisance
algal bloom on the growth and feeding of zooplankton. This small chrysophyte has
been present in local waters for the past 3.5 years at population densities
exceeding 106 cells ml-1, and has caused a major shift in zooplankton community
structure.Most species of zooplankton seem to grow and feed poorly on this
chrysophyte, especially at the high concentrations found in nature. Another
study involves an examination of the relationship between nutrition and
bioluminescence in heterotrophic dinoflagellate species. Most other
bioluminescent zooplankton seem to vary little in the brightness of their
bioluminescence, but the bioluminescence of heterotrophic dinoflagellates seems
to vary greatly with their nutritional state and growth rate. This research is
part of a larger effort to produce a model to predict the distribution of
bioluminescence in the sea.  Another major thrust of research in my laboratory
is studies of behavior of marine zooplankton, especially predator-prey
interactions. Studies involved in these studies would learn state-of-the-art
video-computer techniques for image and motion analysis. We have equipment
available for videotaping marine zooplankton in situ, and quantifying their
swimming behavior using a computerized motion analysis system. Studies presently
underway in my laboratory include a study of swarming behavior in marine
copepods and its role in avoiding predation by fish. This research includes
field work on mangrove-associated tropical copepods at the Smithsonian field
station at Carrie Bow Cay. We also are involved in studies of the factors
influencing selective feeding of larval fish on microzooplankton. We quantify
the behavior (including escape responses) and visual contrast of
microzooplankton prey to determine the factors influencing feeding selectivity
at the encounter, attack and capture phases of predatory behavior.  
</P>
<H3>Benthic Ecology and Invertebrate Zoology - Dr. P. Montagna 
</H3>
<P>Special emphases are being placed on meiofaunal and macrofaunal community
structure and population biology, and environmental studies.  Currently, my
laboratory is very active.  I have two Ph.D. students, one masters student, a
Postdoc and three technicians.  So, there are lot's of people to interact with. 
There are three programs in which undergraduates can participate.  The goal of
one project is to determine the importance of freshwater inflow to Texas
estuaries.  This is part of a multi-year, interdisciplinary program to determine
the affect of freshwater inflow on secondary productivity in Texas estuaries. 
The current focus is on the long-term climatic effects on inflow and nutrients,
which influence macrofaunal community structure and biomass.    The goal of
another project is to determine the effect of a persistent brown tide bloom in
the Laguna Madre.  This is an interdisciplinary effort to determine how brown
tide has effected the ecosystem.  Due to the persistent brown tide, turbidity is
now high, and we are concerned that the seagrass habitat is endangered.  Current
studies focus on how diversity and secondary production are effected and how the
food web has been altered by the presence of the brown tide organism.  In
particular, we are trying to understand the interactions between filter-feeding
organisms and the brown tide algae.    The goal of the third project is to
determine sublethal responses to contaminant exposure.  This is also a large
interdisciplinary program to determine if there are long-term consequences of
oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico.  The concern is that there may be
sublethal responses to production that have not been detected.  Our study
focuses on the response of meiofaunal community structure, harpacticoid
reproduction, genetics, and life history patterns, and meiofaunal toxicity
responses that are a result of environmental perturbations. 
</P>
<H3>Ecology of Developing Fishes - Dr. L. Fuiman 
</H3>
<P>Research projects in Dr. Lee A. Fuiman's laboratory focus on the ecology of
developing fishes.  Most of these studies require rearing of various fish
species from eggs, through larvae, to juveniles.  Undergraduate experiences here
will begin with the methods of small-scale fish culture, including cultivation
of algae, rotifers, and crustaceans.  This will expose students to a variety of
laboratory practices (preparation of sterile media, water-quality testing,
routine maintenance of cultures, data recording).  In the process of rearing the
fish, the undergraduate student will become acquainted with the life cycle of
the food organisms (algae, rotifers, crustaceans) as well as the development of
the fish.  Beyond fish culture duties, the student will participate in one or
more ongoing research projects on the ecology of developing fishes.  These are
likely to include tests of the development of sensory system function in fishes
(including the visual and mechanosensory systems), measurements of swimming
performance, and analyses anti-predator responses.  The student will work with
Dr. Fuiman and his graduate students in data acquisition and analysis.  These
research projects usually involve video recordings of experiments.  Data are
acquired from the video tapes by a computerized interface.  Thus, students may
gain experience in image analysis (including morphometry) and motion analysis
(frame-by-frame digitization) in the process of data acquisition.  Further
computing experience will come during data analysis.    There may also be an
opportunity for field research on the ecology of fishes.  This may include
survey research (collections of specimens at various sites) or experimental
field work.  Experiences here might include work with plankton nets, seines,
trawls, and experimental enclosures.
</P>
<H3>
Larval Fish Ecology and Larval Fishes - Dr. J. Holt 
</H3>
<P>Opportunities for research in larval fish ecology and aquaculture are
available in G. Joan Holt's labs at the Fisheries and Mariculture facility of
the Marine Science Institute.  At present there are four students, two
technicians and a postdoc studying many aspects of marine fish larvae who would
be available to interact with undergraduates working in the lab.  Areas of
ongoing research in which students may participate include: 
</P>
<P>Studies of the effects of changing salinity on spawning, egg and larva
development of spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus.</P> 
<P>Investigations into the requirements for spawning and raising tropical reef
fishes of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea.</P>
<P>Evaluation of the role of microbial ecology in larval fish nutrition.</P> 
<P>Biochemical measures of fish growth including RNA/DNA for assessment of
habitat quality and nutritional status.</P> 
<P>Field studies focusing on the importance of seagrass beds as nursery habitat
for larval and juvenile fish.</P> 
<P>Larval fish feeding studies including the effects of prey behavior and
density on food selectivity by larval fish.</P>  
<P>Many undergraduates have worked in my lab during the summer and have gone on
to graduate studies in biology or marine biology.  Students are allowed to be
active participants in research projects and are encouraged to take part in
discussions about the results and planning for future studies.  These
opportunities allow undergraduate students to explore their latent curiosity in
marine science and to amplify this interest into defined career goals. 
</P>
<H3>Reproductive Fish Physiology - Dr. P. Thomas 
</H3>
<P>Students would receive broad training in reproductive fish physiology with
an emphasis on the terminal stages of the reproductive cycle, final oocyte
maturation and spawning.  The proposed project draws on previous experience with
training two undergraduate students, Toshma Thomas (Jackson College, 1990) and
Claire Fernandez (Texas A&amp;M University, 1991).  The spotted seatrout
(Cynoscion nebulosus), a well established model of reproductive endocrinology,
will be used for the experimental work.  Students would receive theoretical and
practical instruction in all aspects of the project and then gradually assume
greater responsibility for conducting their own research.  Adult seatrout with
fully grown gonads will be collected on their spawning grounds and acclimated to
laboratory conditions.  Training on the effective and humane care of wild fish
for research purposes will be prioritized.  Several methods to sex fish will be
evaluated.  Earlier in the reproductive season vitellogenin, a female specific
yolk protein precursor, and 11 ketotestosterone, the male sex steroid hormone
will be measured in the blood.  The sex and stage of gametogenesis will be
determined by intragonadal catheterization once the gonads have begun to
recrudesce.  Fish will be induced to spawn by the administration of
luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analog.  Spawning success, fecundity and
fertilization success will be determined and the fertilized eggs will be exposed
to various environmental factors until 4 days after hatching when the larvae
begin feeding.  Environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, ammonia
levels and UV radiation would be investigated and biological endpoints such as
hatching success, percent deformities and survival could be measured.  Students
would be expected to develop their own research projects on reproductive
success.  A separate series of experiments would investigate the hormonal
control of final oocyte maturation using an in vitro germinal vesicle breakdown
bioassay technique.  Initially students would repeat structure-activity steroids
with hormones to learn the morphological changes associated with final oocyte
maturation and the concepts of hormone specificity at the receptor level. 
Afterwards students would be encouraged to develop their own research projects
on subjects such as the role of &quot;priming&quot; with gonadotropin on hormone
responsiveness, role of gap junctions, protein and RNA synthesis and ion
channels.  Well designed studies on the regulation of this process would be of
considerable scientific interest and publishable.  Finally, students would
obtain broader perspective on reproductive physiology by attending the weekly
journal club/research meetings in Thomas' laboratory and by learning about a
dozen different projects being conducted by students and postdoctoral fellows in
the laboratory. 
</P>
<H3>Fisheries and Mariculture - Dr. C. Arnold 
</H3>
<P>In the Fisheries and Mariculture Program there are several professional
biologists and graduate students which the students will spend some part of the
summer working with.  This will give the students a chance to participate in the
various areas of research.  As one of the state's most diversified mariculture
facilities, students are given a unique opportunity to be cross-trained in
various aspects of the culture of marine species which include:
</P>
<H4>Culture of unicellular microalgae
</H4>
<H4>Mass culture of marine algae and rotifers
</H4>
<H4>Maturation and reproduction of marine fish
</H4>
<H4>Production and care of larval and juvenile fish and shrimp
</H4>
<H4>Maintenance of marine species in intensive culture systems
</H4>
<H4>Fish and shrimp disease diagnostics 
</H4>
<HR>
<P>UTMSI offers exposure to a wide variety of scientific and culture expertise
allowing exposure to a broad area of the marine science as well as experience
that is applicable to the commercial mariculture industry.
