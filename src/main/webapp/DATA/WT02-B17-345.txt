<H2>Atlantic Forest</H2>
</CENTER>

<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG><I> Clear-cutting of timber; charcoal production; agricultural development.</I>

<P>
Once stretching the entire length of Brazil's Atlantic
coastline, the Atlantic Forest  has been whittled away by settlers,
agriculture, and industrial development to the point that now
only 8 percent of the original forest remains.  The vestigial
forest lies in isolated fragments that form the last refuge for
increasingly rare species of primates, birds, and plants; conserving
what remains is top priority for CI Brazil.  CI is particularly
active in Southern Bahia, which holds the highest known botanical
diversity in the world, and Zona da Mata, an important center
of endemism and one of the country's most devastated habitats.
 Program emphases include encouraging private landowners to convert
holdings into legally recognized private nature reserves; and
creating connecting &quot;corridors&quot; to allow wildlife to
move between the isolated forest patches.

In
1995 field research by CI's Policy Program and CI Brazil yielded
dramatic results: econometric models compared the costs and returns
of growing cocoa, ranching cattle, and clear-cut logging. Cattle
ranching and clear-cutting are shown to be a net drain on local
economies.   

<P>
Since tourism is becoming an economic force in Southern
Bahia, CI also calculated the worth to tourists of protecting
scenic forest resources. The models suggest that deforesting the
Ilheus region would cost the region $75 million a year in foregone
tourism revenue.  On the other hand, protecting the forests and
adding such enhancements as canopy walks could increase regional
economic returns by $15.6 million a year over today's earnings.


<P>
To publicize these results, CI and its local partner, IESB, held
a three-day workshop.  Eighty participants, representing all walks
of life, attended.  In addition, CI held an ecotourism training
workshop for tourism operators and NGOs.

Preventing
further destruction of the Atlantic Forest habitat is CI's chief
objective.  Along with Fundacao Biodiversitas and other NGO and
university partners, CI supports ongoing biological surveys to
locate important forest fragments that might be turned into private
reserves.  The partners are developing a database and GIS system
for the network of private reserves in the state of Minas Gerais.
CI is also supporting two model private reserves.
