Welcome to Dances with Ants Newsletter Dept
By now , winter time is around the corner or for you northerns,
its already here! For us southerns,, winter is not much different
then other parts of the year, only a little bit colder. Yet for ants and other
insects, the farther south the better for them.
During the winter month, ants may want to move  in with you.
This is a great idea to them since theres plenty of food
and water to go around!

So heres where the ant cafe comes to the rescue...

<P ALIGN = CENTER><IMG SRC =antcafe.gif ></P>

<B>The Ant Cafe</B><BR>
     This  is  a small unit which is used to hold  the  ants'
food. This is an important part of your ant control program!
The  ants will go inside the ant cafe to get their food. You
can  get an ant cafe at your local pet store. They're usually called
Finch Bird Houses. Buy 2 or more. $5 is a good price. Buy  8
oz  plastic cups to go inside. Get screws to screw down  the
lid. Go to the store and get some honey, white sugar or
corn syrup. Place the ant cafe in areas where you are seeing
lots of ants. Especially in the front or back of the house.
In the front porch or under the house is where you can place
these during the winter months. You may even have to place inside
the house if the ants have already moved in.
Cover with  rocks if placing outside near the house for
best results.  This  unit  is the central core of your ant control
program and you must learn how to make it work! That's why we
call  it dances with ants; it's  a two way street.
   <HR>
 While ants learn quickly, people do not. So  don't  be
discouraged if  it  takes you and the ants  some  time  to
understand what you want from each other..
Don't use any poison at this point.  Allow the ants to use it
freely  as a food source. Watch and see if they are entering
and actually taking away the food.
<HR>
     During  this time you should be using  Dr.  Bronners
Peppermint soap or some other nature soap as per chapter one
"Dances with Ants", inside the house and along any paths the
ants are using.  Do not spray the ant cafes!
<HR>
     Ants  like a mixture that has a lot of water in  it  as
well.  Since water is an important part of their diet.  I
use 1/2 water and enough sugar whether it is honey or white
sugar or whatever, and I make sure that I add enough to thicken
the water just a little.  Ants really do love honey and sugar
so give them that first!

The results:
     The results you'll get from using the ant cafe will  be
that  allmost right away you will notice less ants  indoors!
Soon  they will only be a few scouts looking around but  the
majority of the ants wll be staying outside.
