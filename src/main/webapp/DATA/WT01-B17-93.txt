<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Dr. Hazel Parcells Shares Her Secrets of Longevity</CENTER></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>At 105, the Grande Dame of alternative medicine shows 
you how to be healthy in an unhealthy world and live past 100.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P>
If you want living proof that alternative medicine not only can help you regain your
health but will help you live a very long time, Dr. Hazel Parcells is your best
example. If anyone deserves the title, &quot;Grande Dame of Alternative Medicine,&quot; at age
105 it is the immaculately well-preserved Dr. Parcells. And if anyone is interested
in living longer, better, with greater health and quality of life-and who isn't?-they
should give Dr. Parcells' prescription for longevity and robust health their
undivided attention.

<P>So, perhaps one way to live to be 105 is to almost die when you're 40, and, not
dying, to totally redo the way you eat, live, and think. That's what Hazel Parcells
did back in 1929 when she was diagnosed with incurable tuberculosis with heart and
kidney complications. 

<P>She had spent her life, like so many others of her generation, dependent on and
trusting in the advice of conventional physicians, yet now they had abandoned her as
untreatable. They gave her a bottle of useless tablets, warning her she could drop
dead any minute, and waved her good-bye. 

<P>But something in Parcells-at the time, she was a typical middle-aged housewife
managing a beauty salon in Walsenburg, Colorado-rebelled and she resolved to find her
way out of illness back into health. &quot;This was probably the most fortunate moment in
my life,&quot; Parcells explains today, &quot;for I realized that I had to do something and not
depend on accepted forms of healing. I had to seek my own way.&quot; 

<P>Perhaps she overdid it, because  here she is at 105 sporting the  complexion, energy
level, wit and mental acuity of a woman easily 60 years younger. Add to this the
modesty, charm, and wisdom of old age and you have an extraordinary healer who
inspires everyone younger than she that the secret to long life is at hand. With 
medical degrees in naturopathy and chiropractic (and two Ph.D.s, one in nutrition,
the other in religion), Dr. Parcells has been the director, since 1947, of the
Parcells' System of Scientific Living, based in Sapello and Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

<P>Through this effort, she has treated, educated, and inspired thousands with the
secrets of long life. &quot;I have been using these methods in my own kitchen and in my
research and teaching for 30 years and there has never been an unsatisfactory
reaction of any kind, to my knowledge.&quot;
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P><A NAME="chemis"> </A>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)</FONT> <B>Preserve the 
Life Energy in Foods</B>

<P>It all begins with correct nutrition, or what Dr. Parcells calls the mastery of
kitchen chemistry. &quot;I was just an ordinary human being with very little information
about anything, except that I knew our food was important,&quot; says Dr. Parcells. She
spent many years researching, studying, and experimenting, using herself as prime
guinea pig. Today, her own longevity is her most outstanding result. 

<P>
Her first line of inquiry, when 
she decided she wasn't going to 
die, was the life energy in foods; 
she would use this to rebuild her ill body. Bear in mind that unlike today, back in
1930s' America, information on natural healing and alternative medicine was found
only after 
diligent research. 
<A NAME="combin"> </A>
<P>
As she healed her lungs, heart, and kidneys, she came to appreciate how crucial is
the electromagnetic energy in foods. &quot;In fact, I learned that this electromagnetic
energy is life itself.&quot; She also learned that it is necessary to carefully preserve
this life energy through correct methods of food preparation, combination, and
cooking. For Dr. Parcells, &quot;correct&quot; means scientific, so she devised unique ways of
actually measuring the energy values of foods, body organs, and states of wellness
and illness. Then she calculated how to match these 3 factors to optimize health. 

<P>
&quot;This system allows us to determine consistently at what energy rate our bodies are
functioning,&quot; says Dr. Parcells. &quot;I have learned that when the body is restored to
its normal functional rate of [electromagnetic] energy, there is no illness.&quot; 

<P>
In the 1950s, Dr. Parcells worked with about 75 doctors and their patients at Sierra
States University in Los Angeles, California, where she was the head of the Nutrition
Department. She studied nutrition intensively, examining how each person's
biochemistry responds differently to the same food nutrients. She recorded the energy
rates of a person before eating specific foods, then the changes in their energy flow
every hour afterwards, to see how well that person's digestive system actually
handled the specific food. &quot;If the energy is lowered following intake, the food is
not fulfilling its mission, but if the energy remains unchanged, the food is
supporting the life force at its present level,&quot; Dr. Parcells explains. 

<P>
Using this approach. she was able to record all the changes in a person's
electromagnetic energy in response to specific foods. This is the key to scientific
nutrition, correct eating, and longevity because it tells you directly what to eat
and avoid. You no longer burden your body (or make it ill) with the wrong foods and
energies.  For Dr. Parcells, one secret to longevity and healing is this: keep the
energy of foods intact so your body can get its full benefit of the health-giving
vitality in foods.
 
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET:
Eat and Cook Smart</CENTER></H3>

Food combining is crucially important. Don't combine two kinds of flesh foods in a
single meal, such as fish and chicken. Don't mix dairy with flesh proteins. Don't
serve meat, fish, poultry, or other flesh foods with grain starches such as bread,
pastries, cereals, dried beans, or pasta. Starch foods such as potatoes, rice, or
millet may be served with proteins if you also include a green leafy salad in the
meal. 

<P>
Use virgin olive oil for cooking. Keep up your intake of pure sea salt; this can
normalize both highs and lows in your blood sugar. Avoid all aluminum products in
cooking and stay with stainless steel, Corning ware, iron, or glass. Don't boil your
foods; cook them, preferably by steaming, at the lowest possible temperature; avoid
pressure cookers as they rob foods of nutrients.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P><A NAME="acid"> </A>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2)</FONT>  <B>Correct the 
  Energy in Your Cells</B>

<P>Health and illness take place at the cellular level of your body. Contrary to
accepted medical belief, Dr. Parcells states that all degenerative conditions develop
when the cells are chemically alkaline. She discovered this, literally, in the field,
while investigating unproductive farm soils. She studied soil so chemicalized that
even strong pesticides could no longer curb the crop pests. The soil was dead. When
she restored it to a normal acid-alkaline balance, the bugs and bacteria disappeared.
Dr. Parcells observed the same relationship between alkalinity and disease in
animals. 

<P>This led her to conclude that &quot;all of our decaying substances and deteriorating
conditions take place in a highly alkaline state.&quot; In fact, the body of a person who
is chronically tired and sleepy is overly alkaline  and will age quickly, but when
the cells in a body are more acid, the person ages less quickly and has &quot;more pep and
drive.&quot; 

<P>This means another key to healing and lasting health is to change your cellular
environment by restoring its acid-alkaline balance. Introduce more acidity to the
cells-in other words, use nutrition to alter the internal environment of the
person-and you can control and eliminate degenerative conditions and illness, says
Dr. Parcells. The easiest way to make this change is to become scientific (and
practical) about how and what you, as a biochemically unique person, eat. Better
living through chemistry, quips Dr. Parcells.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET:
Cleanse Your Cells</CENTER></H3> 
&quot;Cleanse the body; give it the right building materials and nature will heal and
build,&quot; says Dr. Parcells. She developed the &quot;Formula X Broth Cleansing Program&quot; as a
way of cleaning pollutants out of cell tissues. In this program, you drink 8 ounces
of one kind of fresh, unsweetened juice (alternating grapefruit, apple, tomato, and
sauerkraut) every hour for 12 hours a day for 8 days. In addition, you take Dr.
Parcells' special Formula X Broth (made of 6 high-acid dried herbs) and a mild herbal
laxative. Otherwise you eat or drink nothing else. &quot;If you do this every 6 months,
along with a bowel cleanout program, you'll have no health problems,&quot; Dr. Parcell
states.
<A NAME="Water"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET: 
Energize Your Drinking Water </CENTER></H3> 
According to Dr. Parcells' research, distilled water is energetically dead. Most of
our tap water is not much better, but here is a way to enliven it. Fill a clear glass
tumbler with distilled water, set a crystal prism on top of the glass, and place
tumbler and prism under a full spectrum light or in direct sunlight. This can
dramatically raise the water's energy reading, states Dr. Parcells. &quot;We found that by
drinking this water, we raised our energy rate by a like amount.&quot; 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT>  <B>Get the Poisons out of Your      
 Foods and Body</B>
<P>Dr. Parcells' line of research and practical results were years ahead of mainstream
so-called science, and they still are. Today she is tutor to several hundred M.D.s
who study regularly with her; she likes to watch their skepticism change into true
belief. &quot;They start off scoffing but they end up praying,&quot; she says with a giggle. If
you catch Dr. Parcells indulging in giggles, she is just as likely to get somber
about the unbelievable decline in the quality of the Western diet and the equally
awesome deterioration and polluting of the environment-all of which she has witnessed
firsthand and documented in the last 60 years. 

<P>Yet none of this fazed her; rather, she responded to it with the spirit of the true
scientist.  She simply figured out easy things anyone could do at home to neutralize
all these &quot;deterrents&quot; to good health.

<P>Dr. Parcells' system of scientific living and kitchen chemistry begins and ends in
food. Almost everyone knows today that the quality of our vegetables is shameful
compared to what it used to be, and even buying organic vegetables is no guarantee
you will be getting high- quality nutrients in your diet. That's because our soils
are grossly impoverished and poisoned, worn out from several generations of
agribusiness chemicals. 

<P>So, to stay healthy, you have to learn clever ways of coping with these substandard
conditions. The value of the Parcells' System of Scientific Living is its list of
procedures to cleanse foods, neutralize their poisons, and enhance their nutritional
value.  

<P>If you or your foods are polluted, master the techniques of cleansing, neutralizing,
and detoxification.  &quot;What I have learned in my study of energy is that we are all
energy. When that energy changes, it changes the condition.&quot; Correct the energy
fields of body and food and you generate healing and long life, Dr. Parcells
explains. 
<A NAME="SECRET"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET: 
Purify Your Foods</CENTER></H3>

This technique will rid the food items of harmful toxins, chemicals, sprays, and
poisons, and it will noticeably improve the flavor and shelf life of the foods.

<P>Before cooking with them, soak all your fruits, eggs, meats, and vegetables in a bath
of Chlorox and water, at the rate of &THORN; teaspoon Chlorox to 1 gallon water. Make sure
it is the old-fashioned, pure Chlorox; this is hydrochloric acid, not chlorine.
Divide your foods into the following categories and soak no longer than the time
listed: leafy vegetables (10-15 minutes); root vegetables (15-30 minutes),
thin-skinned berries (10-15 minutes), heavy-skinned fruits (15-30 minutes), eggs
(20-30 minutes), thawed meats (5-10 minutes per pound). 

<P>Prepare a fresh batch of Chlorox water for each category of foods; dispose of baths
after use. Soak all Chlorox-water treated foods in a fresh water bath for 5-10
minutes before using. &quot;This treatment has been used for the last 30 years by many
families, saving them untold expenses for illness with no unfavorable reports,&quot; says
Dr. Parcells.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET:
Illuminate Your Foods</CENTER></H3>

 Dr. Parcells developed (and now markets) the Thea-Lite to use light and magnetic
field energy to neutralize the effects of  spray residues, metallics, pollutants, and
additives from foods, especially grains and liquids, that cannot be easily immersed
in the Chlorox-water bath.

<P>Place your food item (for example: milk, cream, butter, cereals, grains, beans,
canned foods) under the Thea-Light for a variable amount of time (10-30 minutes)
depending on the density of the food. Dr. Parcells also developed the  Normalizing
Color Unit to effectively deactivate Cobalt-60, a harmful radiation increasingly in
use in the preservation of food by irradiation. The unit uses high-quality sheets of
colored &quot;cathedral&quot; glass (green and  blue) to neutralize Cobalt-60.
<A NAME="formu"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET:
Take a Therapeutic Bath</CENTER></H3>

You need to cleanse your internal environment, too. Here are 2 of Dr. Parcells'
personal bathing formulas. 
 Bathing Formula 1: This is recommended after exposure to Xrays, environmental
radiation, and Cobalt-60 for symptoms of headaches, nausea, cramps, or muscle aches.
Mix 1 pound of sea or rock salt and 1 pound of baking soda in a tub of very hot
water. Immerse your body in the water for at least 20 minutes or until the water
cools to body temperature. Do not shower or rinse the salt off your body for 8 hours.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4)</FONT>  <B>Remember, the 
  Impossible Is Always Possible</B>

<P>Although she spends more time these days teaching, making videos, and developing a
home study correspondence course, Dr. Parcells still sees students. True to the
essence of naturopathy, she regards each patient as a unique individual with a
specific biochemical pattern and electromagnetic energy. 
<A NAME="bed"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LONG-LIFE SECRET:
Heal Yourself with Magnetic Fields.</CENTER></H3>

<P>Many years ago Dr. Parcells developed a therapeutic bed called a Relaxing Unit that
uses magnetic field energy to provide relief for numerous conditions. The unit
consists of a table into which electrical coils have been placed, and a
positive/negative current switch; the unit itself is plugged into the wall socket.
The positive and negative currents generate magnetic fields which stimulate healing. 

<P>Say you have hyperactivity, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, hyper-anything; spend
20-30 minutes on the Relaxing Unit in the positive field. This will reduce the &quot;field
charge&quot;(or &quot;hyper&quot; quality) in your body. Then spend the same amount of time lying in
the negative field to rebuild body energy. Or say you're exhausted; spend 20 minutes
in the negative electrical field. The unit is already used by both physicians and
patients alike and is available for approximately $1500.

<P>Dr. Parcells' casebook is rich with examples of how she produced healing where other
doctors had failed. The trick is to understand how the body works at the level of
cellular energy and then to adjust the inner environment accordingly. Ridding the
body of intestinal worms and systemic parasites is a cornerstone of Dr. Parcells'
approach, but so is shoring up the endocrine glands, especially the four &quot;power&quot;
glands: adrenals, thyroid, pituitary, and pineal. &quot;I've studied these glands since
the 1930s. I know glands. By knowing how to regulate the endocrines, I've had more
successes and done more impossible things than you could guess.&quot;

<P>For the first 105 years of her unusually productive life, Dr. Parcells has been a
local legend in New Mexico, but with the imminent publication of her memoirs, Life in
Balance, (cowritten with Joseph Dispenza) by a major New York publisher she is poised
to rapidly (become deservedly) become a national legend. No matter: when you're 60
years ahead of your time and you know the secrets of long life, you can afford to
wait until your twelfth decade for recognition to catch up with you. As Dr. Parcells
quips, &quot;Don't say die; say damn, and keep going. Dying is easy, but it's living
that's difficult.&quot;

The Determination Board is a slender, lightweight rectangular box made of Plexiglas<FONT SIZE=-2>[TM]</FONT>,
topped with a 360&ordm; measuring device and an open circle and accompanied by a silver
pendulum.


<P>First you place a &quot;witness&quot; on the open circle of the board; this can be sputum,
blood, a photo, or the written name and birthday of the person. Second, you take the
substance in question (a small amount of, for example, metallic aluminum, or the
vitamin herb, vegetable, or medicine) also inside this circle. Then by carefully
using the pendulum within the space of the 360 degree measuring circle, you get a
numerical reading, or answer. Results higher than 120, which is the healthy energy
baseline of organs or the entire body, indicate good to high nutritional content and
an acidic quality; results lower than 120 are too alkaline and not good for you.

<P>A man with lifelong diabetes was entering a steep decline and all medical attempts to
heal him were failing. Dr. Parcells determined he had a severe tapeworm infestation
in his intestines. Using a formula she developed herself, she quickly cleaned out his
system, purging all the parasites and his diabetes soon became manageable again.
&quot;I've seen this happen over and over, especially with children, that a greater part
of your diabetes cases are the result of worms that upset the sugar balance among the
organs.&quot;
<A NAME="calc"> </A>
<P>After a 9-year-old boy had a tooth extracted, his jaw shut tight and nobody could
open it. Doctors kept him in the hospital for 3 days but were unable to open his jaw.
By good fortune, the boy's mother heard of Dr. Parcells and asked her for help. She
analyzed the boy's condition, then prescribed a special calcium, vitamin B12 and 
parathyroid glandular supplement. She did this knowing that the parathyroid gland
governs calcium function which, in turn, affects the jaws. The boy opened his mouth
in 2 hours and  had no further symptoms.

<P>A young boy was brought to her office having cried and had spasms the previous night;
he had eaten a large amount of chemically sprayed, unwashed apples. At the same time,
a woman in her fifties came in with similar symptoms. She had travelled with her
husband, a mining inspector, deep into the Earth and consumed tainted water. An
analysis of both patients revealed a common cause: arsenic poisoning. Dr. Parcells
prescribed a Chlorox bath to get the arsenic toxins out of their bodies through the
skin. Both recovered quickly.
