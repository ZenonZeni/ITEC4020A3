MIN'S EXCLUSIVE ANALYSES OF THE WEEKLIES'/BIWEEKLIES' 1995 AD PAGES:
"FORBES" FOUR-PEATS; "TIME" BEATS "NEWSWEEK" BY A "NEWT."

If American voters support Presidential candidate Steve Forbes in 1996
in the manner that advertisers have supported his magazine since 1992,
he can start pre-paring his guest list for his January 20, 1997,
inauguration.  For in the business magazines' 1995 ad-page race,
Forbes won by 731.47 and 1,350.38 "landslides" over Business Week and
Fortune, respectively.  Since 1991, when BW last beat Forbes, the
biweekly's ad pages have shot up by 977.60 to last year's 4,543.60
(+27.38% versus 1991; +9.32% versus 1994).  It is a fine salute to the
just-retired vp-advertising/promotion Steve Nicoll, who worked at the
magazine for 31 years (10 fewer than editor Jim Michaels).

* House Speaker Newt Gingrich's impact on Washington, D.C., made him
Time's 1995 "Man of the Year" (see page 1), and Newt's puss on the De-
cember 25 cover provided the difference of the year in Time's 19.10 ad-
page margin over Newsweek.  The latter's associate publisher, Greg
Osberg, is not perturbed, telling min that "exclude the intra-company
'affiliated' ad pages [19.60 out of Newsweek's 2,299.10], and we win
hands down."  Whatever, the change in the Time managing editor lineup--
Walter Isaacson for Jim Gaines--should add further spice to the 1996
contest.  And don't yet count out U.S. News & World Report, which
finished third last year (-5.71%) after being the newsweeklies' champ
from 1992 through 1994.

* Although USN&WR was one of only seven out of the 31
weeklies/biweeklies to lose ad pages in 1995, the overall momentum
from 1994 continued.  If the monthlies' performance is a barometer,
then this year should start slowly...except for Financial World
(-11.96% in 1995), which--believe it or not--expects to set an all-
time ad-page record (dating back to 1902) with its January 16
"Forecast 500" issue.  In min next week: weeklies'/biweeklies' year-
end "numbers crunch" plus fourth-quarter and five-year data.

OKLA. CITY HORROR GENERATED--PROBABLY--NEWSWEEKLIES' 1995 BEST-
SELLERS.

The horrific photograph of firefighter Chris Fields holding the
lifeless body of one-year-old Baylee Almon--among the youngest of the
169 victims of the April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing of the Alfred
Murrah Federal Building--unofficially produced the second consecutive
unanimous best-sellers for Newsweek/Time/U.S. News & World Report (May
1 issues), thus matching the obituary of Jacqueline Onassis (May 30,
1994, issues).  We qualify the USA Today compilation (in its December
18 edition) because it doesn't take into account November and December
issues, which  often affect the standings.  Our comprehensive
"official" listings appear in March.

"Where to Find It" (April 17), "O.J. Simpson/Getting Away with It"
(October 16) edged "Howard Stern Gets Serious" (November 20); (2)
Sports Illustrated--the August 21 obituary of Mickey Mantle followed
the omnipresent "Swimsuit" leader (February 20); (3) Ladies' Home

Gifford (April); and (4) Disney Adventures--December's all-in-the-
family Toy Story.

IN MIN'S "GUESS 'TIME'S' MAN OF THE YEAR" CONTEST: RUNAWAY VOTE-GETTER
RABIN LEAVES NEWT KNOTTED IN RUNNER-UP TIE.

When the newsweekly's editors deferred to Pope John Paul II as "Man of
the Year" 12 months ago, many thought ascendant House Speaker Newt
Gingrich deserved the honor.  But when Gingrich--who is now dropping
like a rock in the polls as rigor mortis sets in on the idled U.S.
government--was named this year's designee (December 25, 1995/January
1, 1996), some felt the Pontiff, fresh from a whirlwind East Coast
visit, better fit the bill.  Such is life when it comes to choosing
Time's annual honoree.  

* The 125 entrants in min's sixth annual "Name Time's Man of the Year"
contest experienced a few difficulties of their own.  While Gingrich
tied with computing pioneer Bill Gates for second place in the min
tallies (15 votes apiece, or 11.9%), Yitzhak Rabin (part of Time's
quartet of 1993 winners) won going away.  But even though the late
Israeli prime minister garnered 35 min votes (28%), no dead
person--not even JFK after his 1963 assassination--has ever been
selected since "Man of the Year's" inception in 1923.  Other popular
choices: Internet (13 votes); O.J. Simpson (12); Bill Clinton and
Colin Powell (five each); and Cal Ripken, Jr., and Balkans leaders
Izetbegovic/Milosevic/Tudjman (four each).

* As for min's prize-winning prognosticators, ad sales rep Ed Bowen
takes the cake--and our $350 first-place check.  Not only was our top
dog the first to pick Gingrich--who represents the Marietta, Ga.-based
Bowen Group principal in Congress--but he also clicked on both
tiebreakers (Winston Churchill was Time's "Man of the Half-Century"
[1949], with Mikhail Gorbachev named "Man of the 1980s" [1989]). 
Runners-up Elizabeth Ruch, who works with NAA's Newspaper National
Network, and paper market analyst Mak Kenyon of A.T. Clayton & Co. get
min checks for $175 and $75, respectively.  

* We also salute these 12 readers who correctly named Gingrich but
finished out of the money either because of filing later than our
winners or missing the tie-breakers:

WITH THE MPA'S PRE-CHRISTMAS REALIGNMENT: IT'S COLEMAN-TO-KENNEY,
ROUND 3.

"I thought I was finished with Tom," jokes Reader's Digest publisher
Greg Coleman, "but I guess the gods wouldn't accept it."  He is
referring to this trifecta: (1) the November promotion of Reader's
Digest Association/USA president Tom Kenney to president of RDA's
Global Magazine/Corporate Development unit; (2) last month's election
of Kenney as chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America board of
directors; and (3) the fact that it makes Kenney serve as Coleman's
"boss" for the third time.  When Kenney moved up at RDA, it seemingly
ended a direct working relationship with Coleman that dated back to
the early 1980s at Woman's Day, and entered a second phase at RD in
1990 (min, November 13, 1995).  But Kenney's MPA election--made
necessary by the resignations of Claeys Bahrenburg and Francis
Pandolfi--puts him in charge of the 1996 American Magazine Conference
[October 13-16], which is being put together by a team led
by...Coleman.  If he and Kenney work as well with the AMC as they did
at RD, it should be an acceptable--and "Digest-ible"--affair.  Con-
ference details are to come.
       * Coleman and Kenney set a precedent with two executives from the
same company holding key MPA positions, but a more significant
precedent is the election of Essence Communications founder
(1970)/publisher/ceo Ed Lewis as MPA secretary (succeeding Kenney). 
Lewis is the first African-American to serve on the board of
directors, and if the ascension proceeds accordingly, he will be
chairman in 1998.

JOE OSTROW IS A CONTENTED CABLE CAMPER.

       Later in January, he will celebrate his "sweet 16" (months, that
is) as Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau president/ceo, and Ostrow
tells min that his industry's best of times is now.  He points to the
November sweeps that showed the combined ABC/CBS/NBC/Fox audience down
to 53% (from 59%) in November 1995, and basic cable's best-ever 19.5
rating for the week ending December 10.  "The 'sea change' is perman-
ent," he says. "Viewers are looking for programs more closely aligned
with their particular tastes and interests, and it is time for [ad]
agencies to realize that the broadcast networks are on a perpetual
downslide." 
* Ostrow, who spent three decades on the agency side (most with
FCB/Leber Katz Worldwide Worldwide), concurs with McCann-Erickson
Worldwide senior vp Bob Coen's +14% cable-advertising forecast for
1996, but disagrees with the $5.3 billion sum.  "Bob used an old $2.31
billion figure for 1994 as his base, which was later adjusted by Niel-
sen, Competitive Media Reporting, and others to over $3 billion.  We
should exceed $6 billion this year."  As for overall 1996 advertising,
Ostrow predicts a "strong first half, with the second-half outcome
predicated on the presidential candidates [who they are], and how
successful new business ventures are.  I'm bifocused."

TICKETMASTER GOES "LIVE!" WITH 40 AD PAGES IN MAGAZINE DEBUT.

     When the curtain goes up on Live! January 23 (February issue), it
will be more than just another of some 800+ magazine launches
anticipated in 1996.  At least that's what its parent, Ticketmaster
Corp., hopes.  Under editor Annie Gilbar and publisher Carole Ference
(ex-House Beautiful), the company believes it can exploit its
entertainment world contacts and vast database of people who regularly
attend live events to forge its place among entertainment magazines. 
With $1.6 billion in 1994 sales, the giant ticket "middleman" may be
on to something.  In its debut, Live!--the brainchild of Ticketmaster
chief Fred Rosen--will run 40 ad pages from the likes of Estee Lauder
and Chrysler Corp..  In coming months, Ference and her sales staff (ad
director is Hearst alumnus Michael Petruncola) will duke it out with
the likes of Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, Rolling Stone, and US for
the almighty ad dollar.  In her first pitch, Ference tells us, "We
know who entertainment customers are and what they buy.  And we have
many ways to reach them: the magazine itself, concert promotions,
ticket stub backs, customer databases, even the Ticketmaster Web site"
(http://ticketmaster.com).  Let the battle begin.

RON GALOTTI AS MATINEE IDOL?  NO...BUT HE GETS A TASTE OF SOAP
STARDOM.

     This Monday (January 8), the Vogue publisher can be seen--and maybe
heard--on a segment of the ABC-TV soap-opera "The City" that airs at
12:30 p.m. (Eastern).  Galotti plays a magazine publisher (who else?)
hosting a party attended by "The City" star Morgan Fairchild.  Whether
this turns into a recurring role will depend on his "Q" rating, which--
if the magazine community comprised the entire viewing audience--would
go through the roof.  As of now, Galotti is not a nominee for any of the
Soap Opera Digest awards, which are scheduled for a Valentine's Day
telecast (during the "heart" of the February sweeps) on NBC-TV at 9 p.m.

PIB: 1995 MAGAZINE AD $$$ SHOULD BREAK THE $10 BILLION BARRIER.

     The 201 measured Publishers Information Bureau magazines need to
accumulate $805.1 million in December 1995 ad revenues to achieve the
goal, and that should be a cinch, given that the then-185 PBI members
totaled $825.0 million in December 1994.  Still, last month's ad-page
slowdown (the monthlies in min's boxscores were cumulatively -1.15%)
will be reflected in the ad-revenue differential, which will be nowhere
near December 1995's +18.0%. Year-end results will be in the January 15
min; January-through-November categorical data are below:

figures should be viewed with caution.
