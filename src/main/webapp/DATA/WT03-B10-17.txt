EURO HDTV SOON TO BE A REALITY?

The United Kingdom has finally backed down and
reached an agreement with its other European partners
over a high definition television strategy for
Europe.

After over three years of wrangling and debate, a
united EC stance has now been made leading to the
possible development of a HDTV standard in the future
(Satnews passim).  A meeting of the EC
Telecommunications Ministers agreed upon a GBP160
million subsidy and the rights for broadcasters to
choose the most advanced broadcast technology
available.  The Council of the EC has now accepted
the 'Action Plan' produced by the telecomms
ministers.

The UK had consistently objected to the GBP700
million subsidy plans raised by community members and
the backing of D2-MAC as the transmission standard on
the grounds that the technology could soon be
superceded by digital HDTV services and that the
imposition of a standard was protecting businesses
rather than the consumers.

Patrick McLoughlin, the newly appointed trade and
technology minister, said after the meeting on 16
June: "European companies can now be at the cutting
edge of this technology and UK providers will be well
placed to take advantage because of their expertise
and experience."

McLoughlin replaced Edward Leigh in an internal
government reshuffle. Leigh caused a May meeting of
ministers to stop making a critical decision on the
future of Euro HDTV after he left early to attend the
launch of Astra 1C.

"This is an excellent outcome for Europe and UK
industry and consumers.  After three years of hard
negotiation we now have a realistic and forward
looking action plan for the development of the coming
generations of TV technology," said McLoughlin.

Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that the funding
would be used to introduce widescreen HDTV television
programme production, transmission and marketing, but
it would be available on a co-financing basis.
Participating companies will have to find at least 50
percent of the total sum required before applying for
an EC subsidy.   Community funding will be phased out
on a sliding scale as time goes on.

"Early entrants in both the developed and less
developed markets will qualify for maximum support
because they accept the highest risks.  Those
undertaking HDTV will also receive a special quality
premium for the same reason," said the EC statement.

IBM 'FINALLY' ANNOUNCES EURO SATCOMMS SERVICE

IBM has finally announced the official existence of
its IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to the
chagrin of the other satellite network operators who
are keeping a somewhat discrete silence over the
whole affair, reports Data Broadcasting News, the
sister publication to Satnews.

After many months of waiting and broken internal
deadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of the
new service to become officially released.  Many
software revisions and internal quality assurance
certifications contributed towards the internal
delays.  Many observers who have seen the system
believe that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.

The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK.

Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s can
be attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The
"general availability" date is slated for 30
September 1993.  Countries will be free to set their
own dates.

Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 to
the power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.
Error correction significantly reduces this
occupance.

IN SatConnect is designed to be operated
independently of other telecommunications networks,
although it can be linked with the existing IBM
Information Network services like the IBM Information
Exchange EDI service to collect data. With the
system, the information provider will link into IBM's
network to transmit data for distribution. Receive
sites will use conventional VSAT hardware combined
with IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSAT
receivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centre
of the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.

Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,
and advanced data masking technology has been
included to provide integrity for transmitted data.
As the system is digitally-based, video, audio and
data can be merged and transmitted securely.

Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at a
set time even though it has been loaded by the
information provider onto the transmission system in
advance. Real time data throughput will be supported
on the system during 1994 once a second release of
software is made during December 1993.  IBM is
presently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"
who wish to send large files to multiple locations
rather than the continuous small-file feed companies.

Real time feeds are considered an important business
area and they will be approached once a steady stream
of customers has been found.

The information provider is charged for connection to
the SatConnect service. There is an initial charge of
GBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for the
transfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use is
charged according to a tariff.  Receive sites cost
GBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual charge
thereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,
existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40
percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costs
down significantly in the process.

Individual per-megabyte charges will be GBP12.40
after the initial 500 megabyte threshold has been
passed.

IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. to
market and distribute its satellite receiver
equipment.  Although IBM is not making the use of
Comstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing the
potential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstream
equipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-
IBM product" and will feature in all promotional and
sales literature.

The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellite
broadcast receiver and LNB are provided under the
marketing agreement.

One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth can
be changed "over the air" in accordance with users'
needs.  The DBR401 receiver will have four pre-
selected data rates programmed as standard reducing
the requirement for field maintenance.

Data sent to the receiving PS/2 computer can
immediately be routed to a LAN server or mainframe if
required, thus freeing local receiver resources and
permitting the prompt processing of data.

* Minimum system requirements for the PS/2 receiver
are: MCA-based bus; 20MHz clock speed; 8MB RAM; slot
for IN card; RS-232 port; OS/2 version 1.3 standard
edition or OS/2 version 2.0

IDB OPENS UK C-BAND EARTH STATION

IDB Communications Group has formally inaugurated
service to its 11-metre C-band earth station in the
United Kingdom.  The station, located at Brookman's
Park outside London, is the first privately-owned C-
band uplink in the UK and the first IDB owned and
operated facility outside of the US.

Brookman's Park is the location of a large array of
transmitting apparatus for the British Broadcasting
Corporation, the UK state broadcasting company.

The earth station will be utilised by IDB Worldcom,
the telecommunications arm of IDB, in cooperation
with the Russian Satellite Communications Company
(RSCC) to operate StatCom, a voice and data
communications service linking the US and other
European cities with the Russian Federation and CIS
countries.

A Russian Statsionar 5 satellite located at 53
degrees east longitude will be used to host the
service.  Customer premises equipment providing
connectivity to the network will comprise of
integrated 3.8 and 4.5 metre C-band earth stations.
StatCom has been running since May 1993 with a
temporary 7 metre antenna.

IDB hopes that emerging and isolated businesses, such
as the oil and gas companies, will find the service a
more viable and cost-effective method of
communications compared to present-day alternatives,
such as the Inmarsat system.

Edward Cheramy, president of IDB, said: "The oil and
gas industry is expected to spend over US$20 billion
in the next decade, developing oil and gas fields in
the Russian Federation and the newly independent
states.  It is estimated that telecommunications
expenditures will surpass US$300 million during that
time period.  IDB and RSCC are well positioned to
serve these major telecommunications requirements."

* RSCC is a state enterprise of the Russian
Federation Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

EC TO ADOPT COMMON APPROACH ON EARTH STATIONS

A recent meeting of the Telecommunications Council of
the European Community has passed a draft directive
aimed at creating a single market for satellite earth
station equipment.

If approved, the directive will assist the
manufacturers of satellite communications equipment
achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete
effectively in European and world markets.

The directive, COM(92)451, would extend the ruling of
directive 91/263/EEC on telecommunications terminal
equipment to include the harmonised certification and
testing of equipment and to guarantee the use of
approved satellite communications in all member
countries.

"The development of satellite communication has been
up to now held back by the fragmentation of the
Community market, in contrast to the situation in the
US where this technology is more widespread," said an
EC statement.

INTEGRATED INMARSAT-M TERMINAL LAUNCHED

ABB Nera has launched a new integrated satellite
telephone system that utilises Inmarsat's newest
Inmarsat-M personal communications standard.

The new offering, known as Saturn Mp, is being aimed
initially at journalists and other world travellers
who require voice and data communications services
often where terrestrial alternatives do not exist.

Saturn uses Inmarsat-M, a new digital satellite
communications standard that has enabled significant
call tariff reductions and reductions on the size of
transmitting and receiving apparatus.  The unit
weighs a total of 9kg and measures 405 x 290 x 120mm,
and is encapsulated in a lockable briefcase.  The
antenna and RF electronics are integrated into the
briefcase's lid.

"The media often find themselves in parts of the
world where conventional communications systems are
frustratingly poor or simply do not exist.  The
Saturn Mp provides them with an instant method of
communication from virtually anywhere in the world,"
said Martyn Braime, managing director of ABB Nera.

ABB already produces a range of communications
equipment for land and marine use, and the latest
product will help complement its existing portfolio
says the company.  ABB also claims to be the UK's
largest supplier of satellite equipment for use on
the Inmarsat system.

"SECURE" VIDEOCRYPT HACKED --CLAIM

Videocrypt, the ever-powerful video encryption system
marketed by News Datacom has been hacked, according
to top signals piracy specialist John McCormac.

There have been many hacks on the Videocrypt system,
but McCormac says that the present one is the most
damaging to date, and it addresses key flaws in the
security system.  It has been tested by McCormac and
confirmed to decode all Videocrypt channels.

Quaintly named as "Ho Lee Fook", the piracy work is
claimed to be based within Central Europe.  The hack
works by effectively acting as a super Videocrypt
smart card, giving unlimited access to channels.

"The card is approximately 16 millimetres longer than
the official Sky card. It is a blue printed circuit
with a single surface mount chip and five connector
pads," said McCormac, explaining that unlike other
hacks, this one does not use a wafer from a usual
legitimate card, but is instead a specially-
engineered chip.

During a period of testing no "kill" messages were
sent to the card, shutting off service to the BSkyB
channels.  McCormac speculates that a filter may have
been added telling the on-board circuitry to ignore
kill or disable messages sent within the Videocrypt
datastream.

Commercially, the hack may be renamed SVA1000, but
like many things in the hacking marketplace, things
can change on a daily basis. Commercial piracy
marketers will incorporate the HLF hack within
existing decoders, and a price point of GBP99 has
been mentioned in some circles.

Due to UK legislation, it would be an offence for
Satnews to give details of the marketing source in a
UK-published publication.  There are reports that one
UK publisher may face prosecution after giving out
the telephone number of Megasat Germany, a purported
supplier for the decoders, on a 0898 premium rate
telephone line.

TCI TURNS EAST FOR CABLE

Telecommunications Inc., the world's largest cable
television operator, is looking East with the
investment in Cable Soft Network, a supplier of cable
TV programmes to Japan's 160 cable TV operators.

The investment, worth around US$2.8 million, follows
on from investments made by rivals Time Warner
Entertainment into Japanese cable television
operating companies.

When compared to the US marketplace, the Japanese
market for cable television services is quite
immature.   Over ten million people nationwide tune
into US cable systems, compared to 700,000 people
tuning into Japanese services.  Japanese industry
forecasters expect this figure to rise to over one
million households by the end of 1994.

EURO-TURNER STARTS, NTL UPLINKS

Turner Broadcasting Systems says that TNT and The
Cartoon Network, its two new European distributed
television services, will commence operations on 17
September 1993 aboard the Astra 1C satellite.

And National Transcommunications Limited (NTL) has
been awarded a five-year contract to uplink the two
channels.  The channels will be originated and played
out at Chrysalis Television Facilities in London and
uplinked from NTL in Winchester.

Alastair Hamilton, director of satellite systems for
Turner International, said: "After careful
consideration of all the uplink proposals, we felt
that NTL offered us the best technical solution, and
in a timeframe commensurate with our launch plans for
the new network."

NTL is noting an upturn in demand for satellite
uplinking services, and it is presently building a
new teleport at Winchester to cater with forecast
demand.  A digital pipeline will be serviced to
London to carry programming sourced by broadcasters
using London either as an origination point or a feed
point through the BT tower.

NTL already has an uplink location in Croydon near
London and in central London on the Chrysalis
Television building. It also services occasional use
clients through its Rapido flyaway terminals.

Initially two 8-metre uplinks have been installed,
although an 11 metre and an 13 metre antenna are
planned.  NTL believes that its Winchester location
is particularly well suited for uplinking because of
the relative RF-free environment.

"NTL is uniquely positioned to provide uplinking to
Astra 1C from our teleport near Winchester," said
John Okas, business development director at NTL.  "We
are delighted to be serving Turner International and
we expect to sign other contracts shortly.  NTL is
now an established force in satellite broadcasting
and providing real competition to BT."

CAMBRIDGE CONFIDENT OF EXPORT BOOM

Cambridge Industries, formerly Cambridge Computer, is
confident that its 1993 export sales will be better
than previous years because of its new ARX200
receiver.   The receiver was launched at Cable &
Satellite '93, and significant interest was shown by
dealers present at the launch.

Alan Oxley, export sales manager for Cambridge, says
that the new product has especially been welcomed by
multi-lingual customers because it can easily receive
transmissions from different satellites, with a
number of decoders being connected into the receiver.

"In Mainland Europe, Astra and Telecom [band] twin
systems are becoming more popular.  We predict demand
will be high enough to introduce a twin LNB input
version of the ARX200 by September, to simplify
installation and remove the need for a switchbox,"
said Oxley.

THREE-FOLD EXPANSION SET FOR EURO DMX SYSTEM

International Cablecasting Technologies -- ICT Europe
-- says that they are expanding their 30-channel
digital music delivery service to 86 channels only
months after the network's European launch.   The new
service will make DMX the largest delivery route for
continuous music presently available.

Jerold Rubinstein, chairman and CEO of ICT in the US,
said that the new enhancement would retain the
company's competitive edge and enable it to give
European cable network operators a greater level of
flexibility in the customisation of channel offerings
in accordance to local tastes or network
restrictions.

Initially the system will be increased from 30 to 60
channels by October 1993, and this will in turn be
increased to 86 channels by the end of 1993.

Included in the new European channel line-up are
specialised international formats such as World Beat,
Flemish Music, Irish Folk, Hebrew Traditional and
Indian programming.

"At DMX we are, and always will be, a music
programming service.  As we move forward into
narrowcasting and niche programming, we reaffirm our
vision of DMX as a music service dedicated to
offering subscribers more choice, more variety and
more of the music they want," stated Rubinstein.

The new channels to be carried on ICT Europe's DMX
service are: German (Easy Listening, Oldies/Schlager,
Folk, Hits & Rock); French (Chansons/Easy Listening,
Hits, Oldies & Chanteuses); Dutch (Easy Listening,
Hits, Dutch Mix, Flemish Mix, Oldies & Childrens);
Irish (Folk); Swiss (Folk); Spanish (Flamenco);
Nordic (Swedish, Norwegian and Danish); Israeli
(Hebrew Hits, Hebrew Traditional); Italian
(Traditional); Russian (Hits) and Ethnic (Indian,
Turkish & Oriental (Eastern Mediterranean).

Satnews has requested an evaluation model of DMX from
ICT and will provide a full review for subscribers
once it has been received and evaluated.

At the National Cable Television Association show in
San Francisco, ICT unveiled DMX Select, a 'music
library in the sky' which offers virtually limitless
digital audio programming options to the cable
television operator.  With the new system, operators
will be able to customise the DMX offering.  Some
cable systems will not be able to distribute the
additional music channels planned by DMX, and the DMX
Select unit will enable them to mix and match
channels to form a composite output.

SETTLEMENT OVER INTELSAT LAW SUIT LIKELY

A litigious law suit between Intelsat and Martin
Marietta has reached a tentative settlement over the
controversial launch of Intelsat 603, a satellite
stranded in low orbit that had to be recovered by US
Space Shuttle astronauts.

A joint statement by the two parties said that the
companies had negotiated terms to settle the
litigation.

Martin Marietta sued Intelsat, seeking relief from
future damages claims. Intelsat counter-sued for the
value of the satellite, lost revenue, and recovery
costs for the satellite.  The satellite has now been
relaunched and is operating successfully.  Martin
Marietta admitted that its Titan rocket failed to
launch the satellite, but pointed out that Intelsat
had 'self insured' and agreed to fund all losses in
the event of a claim.

A US District Court hearing had preliminary came down
in favour of Martin Marietta, although a federal
appeals court sent the decision back to the lower
court, saying that it should look whether Martin
Marietta had made its best effort to launch the
satellite.

The companies have agreed on terms to settle the suit
and agreement from the Intelsat board of directors,
set to meet in September, is now required.  The
companies are remaining tight-lipped over the other
conditions and terms.

Intelsat previously contracted with GE Astrospace to
purchase two satellites. In April, Martin Marietta
purchased GE Astrospace's parent company, making it
fighting against a company it was doing business
with.

Some industry sources say that the agreement is
likely to be based on Martin Marietta honouring the
GE Astrospace contracts with a significant discount
plan.

CIT UNVEILS NINTH ANNUAL SATCOMMS REPORT

The London-based research organisation CIT Research
has launched its ninth annual report into Satellite
Communications in Europe.  The 1993 report analyses
the changes that have been made in the European
marketplace over the past year, and forecasts how
they will change over the short to medium term.

During 1992 satellite carriers (such as Eutelsat,
Inmarsat and PanAmSat) earned ECU835 million from
European operations, with broadcast television
accounting for 55 percent of revenues.  Business
services accounted for 14 percent and telephony for
31 percent of revenues.  Eutelsat was the dominant
carrier, closely followed by Intelsat and SES, owners
of the Astra satellite.

CIT says that Astra has managed to get the reputation
of being a "hot bird" for European television
distribution (DTH), much to the dismay of Eutelsat,
and SES revenues are likely to be ECU220 million in
2002, compared to ECU270 million for Eutelsat.

Clearly Eutelsat's perceived dominance will fall with
SES' rises.

By the close of 1992, CIT estimated that there were
around 6.7 million DTH terminals in Europe, with the
UK and Germany responsible for 77 percent of the
share.   Low cable penetration (and take up) and
strong programming markets were cited as drivers for
this demand.

In Eastern Europe, CIT believes that there are around
800,000 DTH terminals installed, with 44 percent of
these in Poland.  Consumer weakness in the former
Eastern European countries is seen as a barrier for
the introduction of cable television networks or
premium programming.  Instead, viewers are likely to
tune into free satellite delivered programming,
maximising their resources after purchasing a
satellite receiver system.

Digital compression of signals is also set to pose
some benefits to European broadcasters and viewers
says CIT.  "The arrival of digital compression will
eventually radically change the structure of the
satellite TV marketplace, although CIT feels the
change will not be as fast as many insist," says the
report.

BSKYB AND QVC FORM EURO SHOPPING NETWORK

British Sky Broadcasting and QVC Inc. have joined
forces to launch a 24-hour service headed live from
London from 1 October. The service would be carried
on the Astra 1C satellite.

The new alliance was formed at the National Cable
Television Association exhibition.

Barry Diller, chairman of QVC said: "I could not be
more pleased to form a partnership with BSkyB to
bring home shopping to the UK and beyond."

Diller believes that the UK has great potential for a
teleshopping success, and that it would not face
adverse competition from existing teleshopping
companies.

Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and British Sky
Broadcasting, said: "We are amazed at the growth of
direct selling by television and think this will add
a new dimension to BSkyB."

Spain and Portugal will not be covered by the BSkyB
venture, as they are being handled through a deal
with Grupo Televisa, signed in April, which will
provide a Spanish language service for Brazil, Mexico
and Spain.

CONFUSION OVER C-SMATV LICENCE REQUIREMENT

A ruling by the US Supreme Court says that federal
regulation of the cable television industry extends
to satellite systems that serve apartment buildings
with more than one owner, even though no public
access right of way is used.

The ruling reverses a federal appeal court ruling
which said that such communal systems were exempt
from regulations.

Under the 1984 Federal Cable Communications Policy
Act, a franchise is required by operators who provide
service over a cable system, but an exemption was
made for operators who "..serve only subscribers in
one or more multiple unit dwelling under common
ownership, control or management" when no public
right-of-way access (such as a street or pole) is
used.  The common instance of this exemption is where
the owner of an apartment installs a satellite dish
on the roof and installs a distribution circuit into
individual apartments.

The latest ruling upholds the opinion of the Federal
Communications Commission.

DIRECTV SIGNS NEW BROADCASTERS FOR NETWORK

DirecTV Inc has signed a number of new distribution
agreements with cable television channels in North
America.

Under the new agreement The Discovery Channel, The
Learning Channel, C-SPAN, C-SPAN 2 and E!
Entertainment Television will be carried over the
yet-to-be-launched DBS service.

DirecTV has now signed 16 basic cable networks for
nationwide satellite distribution. The channels will
be marketed in rural areas through an agreement with
the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, an
organisation set to up to increase television choice
in rural areas not served by conventional cable
networks.

The first DirecTV satellite is to be launched later
this year, with a second satellite a few months
later.  North American viewers signed up to the
system will be able to view up to 150 channels of
free, subscription and pay-per-view programming from
April 1994 using equipment manufactured by Thomson
Consumer Electronics and sold under the RCA branding.

BRIGHT FUTURE FOR ARIANESPACE SAYS BIGOT

Arianespace has clearly demonstrated its expertise in
the commercial space transport business over the past
five years, according to chairman Charles Bigot at
the recently Arianespace shareholders' general
meeting.

Since it began launching satellites, an average of
seven launches a year have been made by the company,
bringing in handsome revenues and rewards for the
company.  Bigot says that the success has been due to
regular and consistent operations, coupled with
commercial success that continues to consolidate
Arianespace's position as the "..world leader in its
business."

Announcing Arianespace's 1992 results, Bigot said
that total revenues were FFr4.85 billion, leading to
a FFr145.5 million net profit after charges.  A
FFr1.6 billion provision for technical and commercial
risks of launch has also been made.

In the last 18 months, Arianespace has booked 19 new
orders, helping consolidate its position in a
fiercely competitive marketplace.  Business in the
Asia-Pacific region has also been lucrative for the
company, who expect to make greater inroads into that
marketplace in the coming months.

Arianespace now has 40 satellites waiting to be
launched aboard its Ariane 4 launch rockets, worth
around FFr18 billion in revenues and contracts.

The company is slowly preparing to roll out its
Ariane 5 launcher and expects these to enter service
late in 1996.  Arianespace has signed a contact with
Societe Europeenne de Propulsion for Vulcan engines
which will be at the heart of the new systems.  A
three-year transition period will follow where Ariane
4 and Ariane 5 launchers are used according to launch
needs.

Many other companies, particularly those in the Far
East and former USSR, are looking at satellite
launching as a lucrative source of revenue.  Bigot
says that Arianespace believes that excessive
protectionism is not the best way to counter the
threat, but rather create structured competition
allowing the free-market forces to rule.

Arianespace recently signed a contract to launch an
Israeli Amos-1 telecommunications satellite in 1995.
The satellite, referred to as having military
applications, is being used for civilian purposes
says a spokesman for Arianespace.    Since 1988
Israel has launched two satellites into a low earth
orbit as part of a trial of a military communications
and reconnaissance network say observers.

FBI INVESTIGATES COURTROOM SNOOPING

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been joined into
an investigation by judges after a TV station allegedly
hid cameras throughout a courthouse in Cincinnati to see
whether court employees were loafing.

Judges at the Hamilton County Common Please Court ordered
the investigation after the allegations were levied
against WKRC-TV.

Presiding Judge Thomas Crush says that he was told by a
station reporter that the cameras had been installed to
monitor work output by county employees.

William Moll. president and general manager of the accused
station, said that the company would cooperate fully with
the investigation and that disciplinary action could not
be ruled out after the investigation is concluded.

The FBI was called in as US federal law prohibits the
electronic interception of others' communications when
they expect privacy.    Cameras were found after a search
of court rooms.

TALK SHOW CHANNEL LAUNCHED IN US

A new 24-hour talk show format cable television channel
has been launched, with the announcement made at the
National Cable Television Association conference and
exhibition.  Multimedia Entertainment will launch the
channel late in 1994.

Paul Fitzpatrick, former president of the Weather Channel,
will head up the new channel which is designed to offer
all new programming focusing on the major breaking news
topics of the day in a talk-show format.

Key interviewers and personalities will augment studio and
telephone participants.  The majority of new talk show
hosts used by the channel will be 'home grown' and
developed as the channel progresses.

Interaction from viewers is being seen as a key component
for the venture.  A database will be kept noting people's
interests, and should a topic suddenly become newsworthy
they will be called and their views and comments sought
for use on air.   Extensive use will also be made of
viewers' polls and opinions.

Multimedia Entertainment says that the launch of the
channel is the result of extensive research conducted over
several years that has highlighted a niche for the
channel.

"Cable operators will find The Talk Channel to be an
attractively priced alternative to some of the programming
options currently in the marketplace," said Fitzpatrick.

The companies have declined to comment on the press
articles, especially on the claims that other businesses
such as regional telephony and software development may be
considered.

No further details are presently available.

Time Warner and TCI in April formed a venture to establish

PANAMSAT INTRODUCES COMPRESSED VIDEO SERVICES

PanAmSat has recently started the operation of the world's
first commercial compressed digital video service for
multinational programming distribution.

A 24-hour CDV feed with MTV Latin America, Fox Latin
America, NBC Canal de Noticias, Cinecanal and TV5, was
initiated on behalf of programmers who wished to relay
services into the region.

Long-term agreements with broadcasters have been signed.
Programming is relayed by fibre to PanAmSat's Homestead,
Florida, USA uplink and operations centre before being
encoded and compressed using GI's DigiCipher 1000 Milti-
Channel Per Carrier product.

The use of DigiCipher enables six channels to be carried
in the same bandwidth formerly used by one analogue
signal.   By the end of the year, PanAmSat will be
distributing the CDV signals to around 500 cable headends
and wireless cable installations in Latin America for
rebroadcast.

"PanAmSat's success in Latin America has proven the need
for innovative satellite technology," said Fred Landman,
president of PanAmSat.  "Our reputation as the preferred
satellite in Latin America promoted demand we could not
keep up with.  By using compression, now we're once again
able to provide 24-hour broadcast distribution services on
PAS-1."

GENERAL DYNAMICS DISCOVER ROCKET FAILURE

General Dynamics Corp. say that a loose screw led to a 25
March malfunction of an unmanned Atlas rocket, whose
failure left a US Navy satellite in a useless orbit.  The
failure has now been corrected and will not hinder future
launches.

"General Dynamics believes, and the independent oversight
review board concurs, that it has taken a conservative and
prudent approach to the corrective action needed to return
Atlas to flight," said a statement issued by the company.

A US Navy satellite, manufactured by Hughes Aircraft,
entered a worthless orbit due to a malfunction stemming
from failure of a precision regulator in the Atlas
booster-engine power control subsystem, leaving it 3000
miles lower than a contractually required orbit of 9000
miles.

The failed launch could not have came at a worse time for
the company as it was the first of nine launches for the
US military in a three-year, US$1.6 billion programme.

Some industry analysts believe that the March failure will
make it hard for General Dynamics to win future business,
especially in the face of already stiff competition.

ADVERTISING FAILS TO MAKE MARK ON SATELLITE

In their thirst to maximise revenues, satellite
broadcasters are often failing to take into account the
needs of advertisers, instead concentrating on the
introduction of subscription services, a report published
recently claims.

Datamonitor published a report which says that revenue
from satellite advertising will contribute around 8
percent of all Europe-wide satellite channel revenues by
1997.  Advertising is set to account for US$761 million
(10 percent) in 1993.

The report says that by 1997, revenues from subscription
services will be worth US$16,500 million.  Datamonitor
cites a claim that many advertisers are feeling deprived
of valuable viewer penetration by the subscription
channels, or are being held to ransom for occasional
spots.

Many channels that do accept advertising are often
comparatively unwatched when compared to the blockbuster
subscription channels.

FCC DELAY TO COST CONSUMERS US$250 MILLION

A decision by the FCC to delay the enforcement of new
cable television regulations until 1 October will cost
consumers more than US$250 million in overcharging,
alleges a congressman and consumer advocate who backed the
legislation.

The FCC estimates that most cable companies are
overcharging customers by around US$1 billion per year in
total.

Republican Edward Markey, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications subcommittee and Gene
Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America are
dismayed by the FCC's decision.

FCC Chairman James Quello says that the delay was due to
the lack of funding required to hire accountants and
attorneys to do the work demanded by the law.

"Going forward [with the legislation] at this time would
have resulted in mountains of complaints and certification
requests piling up at the commission, leading to chaos and
confusion among subscribers, cable operators and
franchising authorities, and resulting in numerous legal
challenges," said Quello.

MURDOCH MAKES BID FOR HK COMPANY

Rupert Murdoch has announced intent to purchase a 22
percent stake in the world's leading producer of Chinese
language television fare.

News Corp. has agreed to buy the stake of Television
Broadcasts Limited, although the deal is subject to
regulatory approval.  Sources say that the stake is worth
around US$237 million.

Foreign companies may not own more than 10 percent of a
Hong Kong television company without approval being
granted by the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority, and a
stake of more than 15 percent cannot be held without full
government approval.

An application for approval has been received by the Hong
Kong government, and a decision is likely to take several
weeks.

A News Corp. spokesman, quoted in an article in the South
China Post, says that the company is confident of winning
government approval, yet it is prepared to fight if
necessary.

SPECIAL REPORT: CABLE IN THE HEARTLANDS
Satnews looks at the inroads cable television and
telephony has made into the Midlands region of the UK

Cable services across the Midlands are as diverse in style
and nature as the region itself. The heartland of Britain
is a centre of major development and innovation in the
cable business.

Twenty-three of the UK's cable franchises are located in
the Midlands. Not all are operating, but the region as a
whole is currently at the forefront in terms of cable
construction with seven major developments each having
more than 2,500 connections. Coventry Cable, which began
in 1985, is now one of Britain's few completely-built
systems (another is in Aberdeen, also owned by the Devanha
Group).

The Midlands region comprises three distinct conurbations
or groups of cities. Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, each
with active cable systems, form the backbone of the East
Midlands; to the West current cable activity centres on
the Birmingham/ Black Country conurbation and Coventry,
while development has yet to begin in the Potteries.
Annual cable investment in the region is currently
approaching GBP100m, with a total capital spend which will
eventually reach about GBP750m.

Many aspects of the cable business nationwide are
concentrated in the region: from telephony to specialist
programme services. Nearly a third of the Birmingham
system's subscribers use cable for their telephones, for
instance, and about half of the cabled homes in one
district of the city subscribe to TV Asia at GBP7.95 a
month.

The region, although large, in practice has cable
operators who are mostly independent from each other in
ownership. The only joint effort is the advertising sales
co-operative between Midlands Cable and Birmingham Cable.
Between them they could command a million homes - the two
largest franchises in the country.

The geographical diversity is complemented by a wide range
of potential subscribers from a notably multi-ethnic
audience. A quarter of the population of Leicester, for
instance, is of Asian origin. Fourteen per cent of people
living in Birmingham have Asian backgrounds, rising to 50
per cent in the Small Heath area. The next programming
opportunity in Birmingham is for its considerable Irish
population, though its 40,000 members are more
widely-spread than those of Asian origin.

Satellite receivers have taken their share of the
potential business of course, but Ted Campbell, Managing
Director of Birmingham Cable Limited, does not see them
outliving the arrival of cable services in an area: once,
that is, people have had dishes for a year or more and the
pain of paying for them has been blunted by time.

Sidney Bernstein was said to have chosen the North-West to
start Granada Television because he thought it was always
raining and people would stay indoors to watch television.
Ted Campbell says there are not all that many
opportunities for the mass of the scattered Midlands
population to find entertainment outside the home as might
be the case with the London entertainment circuit.

Subscribers are also responding well to the offer of
residential and business telephone lines, coupling a state
of the art network and locally based service with lower
tariffs. Birmingham Cable is now installing Northern
Telecom DMS 100 switches costing more than GBP5 million,
with a capacity of 73,000 lines. The company already has
almost 27,000 residential telephone connections, a third
of 3,000 potential business lines installed and about
2,000 telephone-only subscribers.

Eighty-three per cent of calls in Birmingham are local.
According to Ted Campbell, city-based operators find it
more profitable to use their own local lines instead of
those of BT or Mercury. In smaller towns, the proportion
of local to long-distance calls would be lower, thus
diminishing the benefits of self-drive telephony.

The other major franchise holder in the central Midlands
conurbation is based in Dudley. Midlands Cable, currently
completing a partnership agreement with Cox
Communications, covers Wolverhampton and the Black
Country, and by the end of March had passed 63,000 of the
potential 470,000 homes. It had made 11,917 connect ions -
a penetration of 19 per cent. Midlands' second franchise
is based on Telford with a potential 55,000 homes, 18,000
of them so far passed.

In the East Midlands, Gary Davis, Managing Director of
Nottingham-based Diamond Cable, thinks the region is so
cable-active because 'the Midlands has seemed to me very
progressive: ready to accept change and try new products.'

Diamond, owned by Alabama-based businessman Allan J
McDonald, has seven franchises which together represent
about 519,000 homes. Six of these are in the East
Midlands. Gary Davis was a communications lawyer in the US
who migrated into cable development. His wife Sandy Davis
is Customer Services Manager at Diamond Cable.

Telephony is the spearhead of Diamond's marketing. In
mid-April Diamond had 3,000 cable television subscribers,
4,400 residential telephone subscribers and 100 business
telephone subscribers. The company was the first in the UK
to have its own telephone exchange. Diamond Cable's 42
programme services include two text-based local services,
one of which is produced in association with Radio Trent,
the local independent station.

Martin Beard became General Manager at Coventry Cable
Television in January 1992 - three months after the
Devanha Group took over. Coventry were early starters in
cable, and the franchise area covers about 119,000 homes.
The company does not currently offer telephony, but
discussions are in hand about its development. Coventry
offers 29 channels, including its popular COLT (Coventry
Local Television) channel. This is still expanding its
output and plans to put out ten hours a week of
substantially local programmes during this summer

On the city's place in the cable market, Martin Beard
comments: 'Coventry is a good prospect for cable. It has
long traditions at the forefront of innovation.' With new
credit control policies in place, Coventry Cable is
looking for growth this year and believes it is on a good
footing to make that happen. It is marketing a positive
image, an increased level of customer satisfaction and
better programme product.

Alan Chaney became Chief Executive at Leicester
Communications Ltd in March, when SaskTel took over
control, although he had been associated with the
Leicester, Loughborough and Shepshed franchises since
1988. Although it is a minority share, Leicester
Communications remains the only UK cable company to have
local authority investment.

Construction was halted about a year after the start of
building, but is now resuming. The company has pushed up
its penetration rate in recent months to 27 per cent and
Alan Chaney predicts that it could rise to between 30 and
40 per cent.

It is now launching telephony in Leicester and hopes to be
offering it to some 3,000 homes by autumn. Chaney feels
that the telecommunications development will greatly
increase the system's marketing potential.

Leicester currently offers 34 channels, although the
system has potential for 55. Cable 7, Leicester's licensed
local channel, was launched last summer.   The Community
Channel Manager, Jenny Ludlam, now has about 100
volunteers providing ideas and programme input. The
channel transmits eight hours of local programming a week,
ranging from the care of pets and finding homes for them
to religion and reports of Leicester City Council
meetings.

One proud achievement of Derbyshire Cablevision, according
to General Manager Keith Tonge, is that in 18 months of
building more than 80 miles of cable, the company had
received only 12 complaints. 'Derby is one of the best
cable franchises to have. It has the benefits of being a
concentrated area to build in, but the city itself has not
suffered many of the inner urban social problems which
have been a feature of other cities,' said Keith Tonge.

Derby has a text channel giving out local information, but
the company's Community Liaison Officer, Rachel Turner,
has also been developing an interesting local project with
schools. Six Derby schools - three of which are already
cabled - are producing videos on environmental issues in
their areas. Derbyshire Cablevision plans to screen a
compilation tape when they are complete.

The outer edges of the Midlands region also have some of
the country's most interesting cable developments:
Northampton, with a massive 56 per cent of homes connected
from those passed, is involved in a transition from
narrowband to broadband; Milton Keynes, where virtually
everyone is connected to one of the oldest of the
industry's networks, is also being upgraded; and Swindon,
the first UK cable franchise which, by the end of March,
had risen to one of the country's highest ratios of homes
connected at 32.7 per cent.

As the man said, you have to speculate to accumulate. The
diversity of the Midlands has attracted many different
aspects of speculation. And accumulation - of both
connections and services - is now firmly in the category
of the pipeline rather than the pipe dream.

NEWS IN BRIEF

Following the announcement by US President Clinton that
the US was going to develop a modular space system derived
from the original "Freedom" concept, the director-general
of the European Space Agency, Mr Jean-Marie Luton, has
affirmed his satisfaction at the news and confirmed that
ESA will work together with NASA on development work for
the station.

NTL has won the Peter Wayne award for design and
innovation at the Montreux television symposium (ITS) for
its System 2000 video compression equipment.  The annual
award is presented in recognition of good design, quality,
technical excellence, value for money and innovation.
System 2000 enables four or more digital TV channels to be
transmitted on a carrier that would usually support one
analogue signal.

The Second European Space Agency Electronic Components
Conference was recently held at ESTEC in Noordwijk, the
Netherlands, and attended by over 300 specialists from 20
countries. The conference concluded that the market for
high reliability space components is rapidly changing,
that the complexity of electronic components used in space
programmes is increasing, that programmable integrated
circuits are needed in space programmes and that the
exchange of data and information regarding components in
space applications is necessary.

Satellite television equipment dealers Electrotech in the
UK have introduced a new GBP16 flat price service repair
charge for equipment returned, guaranteeing the goods to
be repaired and returned and replaced within 72 hours.
The offer applies to equipment produced by Maspro,
Echostar, Palcom, PACE, Amstrad, Panasonic, Nokia, Hitachi
and JVC.

Cambridge Cable Limited, the cable television franchise
operator in the UK, is now offering free installation of
telephone service even if customers do not subscribe to
its cable television service.  The company hopes to
attract customers who do not require extra television
channels but wish to make considerable call savings over
BT and Mercury Communications.

Muzak has signed a multi-year contract worth US$2 million
with Antex Electronics Corp. for a new satellite
downloadable message system.  The digital system allows
the recording and playback of digitized audio messages and
schedules for use within retail shopping organisations.

Funding for BBC World Service Television should be taken
out of the hands of the UK government's Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, said shadow Heritage Secretary Ann
Clwyd at a recent lobby aimed at defending broadcasting
institutions.  WS is likely to make severe cuts after
being advised of budget cutbacks by the FCO.  Clwyd said
that the WS was one of the UK's best ambassadors and that
it should not face such financial restrictions.  BBC WSTV
is not affected by the planned cutbacks.

Hughes Communications Inc. and IDB Broadcast have signed a
long-term transponder lease aboard Galaxy 1R.   IDB will
market digitally compressed transmission services aboard
the transponder, and it already has its first customer
with Action Pay-Per-View, a 24-hour programmer of action
and adventure movies.  The C-band service will be aimed
primarily at cable network operators.

Digital Cable Radio in the US has expanded its service to
offer 57 channels of music programming.  One new channel
includes a news and information service as well as a
background music service aimed at businesses.  DCR is also
continuing to provide digital audio simulcasts of basic
cable TV channels such as HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, VH-1 and
MTV.  DCR has also signed an agreement with Time Warner
Cable to roll the service out to around 825,000
subscribers this summer.

A strike by television language dubbers in Spain is likely
to leave viewers lost for words.  Spanish viewers tune in
avidly to dubbed foreign programming, but a strike by
around 1100 dubbers seeking a uniform pay scale since 24
May means that TV operators have run out of dubbed
programmes in Spanish and Catalan.  Non-union dubbers are
being drafted in to ease the situation, but many
programmes are still not being dubbed.  The union is
urging viewers to complain to the TV networks.

There have been reports of interference caused by Astra 1C
to Eutelsat II F3 (16 degrees east longitude) on receive
dishes less than 90cm.  Although the Astra 1C satellite
has yet to complete testing and enter service, some
interference has been noted on 'common' transponders.  SES
and Eutelsat are actively monitoring the situation.

Hughes Communications Inc. and General Communications Inc.
have signed an agreement to extend GCI's long-term
transponder lease on Hughes' SBS 5 satellite until the end
of its life, presently estimated to be late 1999.   The
Ku-band transponder will be used to continue the provision
of network services through VSAT terminals.

IDB Communications's IDB Mobile Communications subsidiary
has signed a two-year Inmarsat-A service distribution
agreement with Sea Link Limited, whereby Sea Link will
coordinate mobile satellite voice, fax and data
communications services to Canadian and other
international users.  The global service will be provided
through IDB earth stations in California and New York, US
and Gnangara, Australia.

The European Commission is reviewing plans by Itochu
Corp., Mitsui & Co., Sumitomo Corp. and Nissho Iwai Corp.
to set up a joint venture in Europe to market satellite
communications equipment.   The EC has until the end of
June to review the proposal and to decide whether it will
have an impact on the existing marketplace.  If approved,
the companies plan to merge their business interests into
a new company called Newco.

A study by the University of Pennsylvania's Anneberg
School of Communications says that US television remains
largely white, male, middle-class and not middle age.
George Gerbner, dean emeritus of Annenberg, said that the
School studied 10 years of prime time television shows,
nine years of Saturday morning programming, various cable
shows, a week of daytime television and game shows and a
week of TV news.  Gerbner said that the average US home
watches TV for around seven hours daily and television
'seems to be frozen in a time-warp of obsolete and
damaging representations.'

Countdown has began for the launch of Arianespace flight
57, which will see the launch of Galaxy IV into a
geostationary orbit.  The launch, from the Kourou space
centre in French Guiana, is set for early  24 June.  At
the time of going to press there were no delays on the
launch schedule.

Telecommunications Inc., the largest cable television
company in the US, says that over half the television
stations on its systems have agreed not to charge it fees
to retransmit its programming, an action brought around by
the new Federal Cable Law.  Many operators are working
with TCI to create new ventures and regional activities by
means of complimentary recompense.

IDB Communications Group Inc. is planning to offer US$150
million of convertible subordinated notes due in 2003 in a
bid to raise additional funds, said a registration
statement filed to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission.

television station has been killed by a sniper while

a rival station for TF1, was killed the previous day in a
similar incident.

The Taiwanese Economics Ministry has signed a letter of
intent to participate in the US$4 billion Iridium global
satellite communications project headed by Motorola Inc.
The Ministry filed the letter of intent on behalf of
Pacific Electric Wire and Cable, who plans to invest US$80
million into the venture.

An executive of one of the Italian media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi's companies has been arrested on suspicion of
corruption. The arrest follows a large purge of corruption

NORTH AMERICAN SIGHTINGS
By Robert Smathers

The Galaxy 4 launch scheduled for June 9 was delayed.  The
cause  of the delay was a possible electronic abnormality
in the launch  vehicle.  As of this submission, no new
date for the launch has  been set, but the launch was
expected to be tried again in one to  two weeks.

The Caribbean Super Station has moved transponders
recently.  They used to be seen on Galaxy 6/22, but now
they are on Galaxy  7/22.  CSS is a occasional video
service, usually seen in the  evenings a few days a week.

NHK Japan has moved transponders on Galaxy 6.  They used
to be on  Galaxy 6/18 but now they are on Galaxy 6/22.
This NHK Japan  channel is the circuit from New York to
Tokyo.

The CBS Television Network Contract Channel on Galaxy 6/7
has  appeared more often as of late.  Usually only feeds
to the network have appeared, but recently there has been
a slate announcing G6/7 as CBS TV and that slate has been
up quite often.  It is expected that the CBS Television
Network will occupy Galaxy  6 and then "hot-switch" onto
Galaxy 4 when G4 is launched and  becomes operational.

SATELLITE TV EVENT OF THE WEEK:  The main event this week
was the  United States military action in Mogadishu,
Somalia.  The  military bombed and destroyed some
strategic targets of a warlord.  Coverage was found on the
newsfeeds of the networks as  well as an occasional feed
on Telstar 301, Telstar 302, Galaxy 6,  or Galaxy 7.  I
assume the majority of the coverage of this  military
action was found on the Atlantic satellites where all  the
major networks have their contract channels on an Intelsat
to  carry coverage from Europe/Africa back to the United
States.
