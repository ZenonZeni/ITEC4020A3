<center><b>Conspiracy Theory? No Way</b></center><p>
Recently during an extended RV road trip, I bought your magazine. I read everything with great enthusiasm, thinking what a great job you folks are doing. Then I came to your summary of the book, Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola—Nature, Accident, or Genocide? by Leonard G. Horowitz [Book Report,” Digest No. 12—Editor’s Note: Horowitz contends AIDS and Ebola were probably concocted in a secret government germ warfare lab]. I was appalled.<p>
Alternative medicine needs the support of the general public if the American people are to be given the right to choose their preferred form of treatment under any third party payment plan. Outlandish accusations, such as those contained in your book review, only serve to completely discredit all information contained in your magazine in the eyes of the general public.<p>

<center><b>Conspiracy Theory? Absolutely</b></center><p>
I received a copy of your magazine and was quite impressed by it. It’s about time I read material regarding health issues that doesn’t feel like a pack of lies....The FDA still after all these years does not allow folic acid to be sold in greater doses than 800 mcg. I am supposed to take from 50-150 mg daily! In order to get that amount, I would have to swallow a whole bottle of pills every day....<p>
It seems odd to me that this harmless but essential nutrient must be ordered on prescription as if it were a dangerous drug.<p>
This may sound pessimistic but I believe that this was a preplanned strategy to create an epidemic of iatrogenic [doctor-caused] diseases. More and more Americans have no choice but to explore alternative solutions to health care. These days health is truly for the wealthy....Keep up the good work.<p>

<center><b>The Digest Gets Around</b></center><p>
<i>Editor’s Note: In “Letters” for Digest No. 13, we published a letter from Wayne B. Jonas, M.D., Director of the Office of Alternative Medicine, and our response that Dr. Jonas was no longer informing the public about cancer alternatives and had sold out to the conventional cancer industry. The correspondent sent copies of this exchange along with the following letter to U.S. Congressional representatives.</i><p>
I have lost many near and dear ones to cancer....Their loss made me tremendously sad, angry, and frustrated. I’m one of those people who have no doubt that rising cancer rates are due primarily to ubiquitous environmental pollution, and secondarily, to the short- and long-term effects of conventional medicine.<p>
The enclosed communiqués deal with the issue of providing information to individuals diagnosed with cancer. I agree that the diagnosis is a source of trauma, and that virtually any and all information provided may be overwhelming to the individual. However, I do not believe the solution to this problem is to withhold information, but to provide resources to the individual to assist them in dealing with the information.<p>
In conclusion, I wish to state that I wholeheartedly agree with the assertions and positions stated by the Digest in its response.<p>
