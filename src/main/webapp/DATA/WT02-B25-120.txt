<p><i>Consider replacing one or both of the success stories below
with the story(ies) of a local individual who has been treated
for a brain disorder. If possible, offer to introduce the
reporter or news director to the individual(s) for the
development of a feature on the treatments available for brain
disorders. You may also want to supplement this letter with one
or more of the fact sheets on individual brain disorders that are
provided in this kit.</i></p>

<p>Dear<b><i> [Name]:</i></b></p>

<p><i>Daphne has experienced schizophrenia for ten years and once
even attempted suicide. After two years of treatment with a new
medication, she is teaching public school part-time and living independently.</i></p>

<p><i>Alex, who has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), was
obsessed with the idea that the CIA was following him. Treatment
helped him control his thoughts. He is now studying accounting in college.</i></p>

<p>These are just two of the many success stories that have been
made possible by recent advances in the understanding, diagnosis,
and treatment of brain disorders.</p>

<p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or
five million Americans, suffer from a severe form of one of the
following brain disorders -- schizophrenia, panic disorder, OCD,
bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major
depression.</p>

<p>In <b><i>[city/town]</i></b> alone, <b><i>[number]</i></b>
people suffer from brain disorders. Left untreated, disorders of
the brain may profoundly disrupt a person&#146;s ability to
think, feel, and relate to others and to his or her environment.</p>

<p>Fortunately, treatment of brain disorders is available, and it
works. In fact, there are impressive success rates for the
treatment of severe forms of brain disorders with medications and
other therapies. According to the National Institute of Mental
Health, the current success rate for treating schizophrenia is 60
percent; panic disorder is successfully treated 70 to 90 percent
of the time; treatment of OCD is successful 75 percent of the
time; bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) has an 80 to 90
percent treatment success rate; and major depression has a 70 to
80 percent treatment success rate. And, as illustrated above,
people who are treated for brain disorders can lead healthy, productive
lives.</p>

<p>For the millions of Americans affected by brain disorders, it
is vital that the public be made aware that brain disorders are
biologically based physical disorders that can be treated. I
would very much like to meet with you to introduce you to the <b><i>[city/town]</i></b>
affiliate of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)
and provide you with additional background information on science
and treatment issues related to brain disorders. </p>

<p>Enclosed for your information are <b><i>[fact sheets on brain
disorders as well as background information on AMI]</i></b>. I
will call you in a few days to see if we can set up a time to
meet. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please
don&#146;t hesitate to call me at <b><i>[insert your phone
number]</i></b>.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><b><i>[your name]</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
