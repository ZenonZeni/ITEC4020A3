<B><I>How can the talents of young gifted children be assessed and nurtured? </B></I><P>   A variety of instruments and procedures are used to identify gifted students.  The recognition and nurturing of giftedness in young children (K-3) is particularly challenging because school systems generally prefer to avoid labeling the children.  Informal or formal identification may involve procedures such as teacher assessment of a child's problem solving ability, parental assessment of a child's abilities and interests, or the assessment of student products (portfolio assessment). <P>

When looking for instruments or procedures, it is important to keep in mind that
identification should be linked to curriculum.  If an instrument is used to identify talent,
then school districts should be prepared to adapt curriculum to nurture and foster those
 identified talent areas.<P>

The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Virginia 
has a database of empirically sound identification instruments that can be used with a variety of populations.  When contacting NRC/GT at UVA for information about identification instruments, it is suggested that you provide specific information about your  school district and the populations you wish to assess.<P>

The Javits 7+ Gifted and Talented Program (Community School District 18,  Brooklyn,
New York) was designed to provide an opportunity for  socioeconomically
disadvantaged children to receive intensive school-based  activities that would prepare
them for gifted education programs.  Teachers  assessed students using Howard
Gardner's concept of multiple intelligences and  provided instruction for them using a
thematic approach.  (Author/JDD)<BR>   Descriptors: *Ability Identification;

This analysis of underserved gifted preschool and primary children explores
the identification of gifted children from the current perspective, examines
the impact of current identification practices on underserved populations,
outlines some promising practices for assessment, and summarizes implications
for educational development when serving underrepresented populations.  It is
concluded that educators are now paying more attention to the needs of
underserved populations with systematic research into issues of assessment,
programmatic alternatives, curriculum integration, and evaluation.  Stressed is
the need to apply research findings to modify practice at the local, regional,
and state levels and to develop assessment approaches which examine both
performance and potential.  Portfolio assessment is seen as one alternative
strategy for identification of gifted children in underserved groups.  A
continuum of programmatic options is recommended based on identified student
strengths.  Changes in state and local funding procedures are suggested which
would support a broad range of opportunities and services.  (16 references)

This research examines how a developmentally appropriate educational program  in
the early years can affect the development of gifted children.  The  qualitative research
specifically focused on a multi-age, multi-ability setting  with partial implementation of a
whole language program, a systematic writing  process and with some flexibility in
grouping of students.  Eleven teachers and  approximately 260 students in an ungraded
primary school were involved, with 3  first year and 30 second year students identified
as gifted.  The study found  that gifted children followed a somewhat accelerated
curriculum.  Teachers felt  that there were definite social benefits to integrating the
gifted and  nongifted students.  The multi-age, multi-ability setting seemed to allow
young  students not identified as gifted to progress more rapidly than they might have
in a traditional graded classroom, as they were exposed to higher level  instruction.
There was little evidence of the development of creative  productivity or multiple
intelligences other than linguistic and logical- mathematical.  Interviews with teachers
indicated their willingness to allow  students to do above-grade level work and to use
higher level materials with  some children.  Interview questions are provided in an
appendix.  (Contains 12  references.) (JDD)<BR>

Gifted Students and Whole Language: A Descriptive Study of Four Classrooms.<BR>

This descriptive study looked at the provision of differentiated language  arts
instruction for gifted students by means of whole language instruction  approaches in
regular classes.  Two classrooms in each of two elementary  schools were identified as
exemplary whole language classrooms and each  contained several students identified
for school gifted programs.  One  classroom in each of grades 1, 2, 4, and 5 was
represented.  Participant  observation was conducted at least once per week for
approximately a semester.   Additionally, interviews with the classroom teachers, the
principals, the  reading/language arts coordinators, the teachers of the gifted, and the
targeted students were conducted.  The benefits of the whole language approach  for
these students were analyzed in terms of: student choice of reading  materials,
responses to reading, and writing projects; use of time; social  interaction; and
appropriate teaching.  Analysis indicated: all teachers and  classrooms provided
examples of some exemplary practices but none provided all  those components
advocated by either whole language experts or educators of the  gifted; the classroom
that provided the most exemplary whole language practices  also provided the most
differentiation of learning experiences for gifted  students; and both students and
teachers had difficulty articulating what  appropriate challenges and differentiated
language experience meant to them.  It is concluded that, although whole language
instruction is a positive  approach, it does not preclude the need for differentiated gifted
programming.   (Contains 28 references.) (DB)<BR>

The digest addresses ways that parents and educators can nurture giftedness
in young children.  Problems in appropriate school placement for young gifted
children with uneven development are discussed and illustrated with examples. 
In selecting a program, parents need to look for a highly individualized program
in which children are encouraged to progress at their own learning rate, with
planned opportunities for development of social, physical, and cognitive skills
in an informal classroom atmosphere.  Parents also need to support the child's
need for friendship with intellectually equal children.  Includes six references.  (DB)<BR>

This brief information sheet summarizes the types of social-emotional 
problems common among gifted children and suggests preventive actions schools 
can take.  A table lists problems associated with characteristic strengths of 
gifted children.  Specific problems briefly addressed include: uneven 
development, peer relations, excessive self-criticism, perfectionism, avoidance 
of risk-taking, multipotentiality, the presence of disabilities, difficulties 
adjusting to the school culture and norms, relating to expectations of others, 
depression, and problems in peer and family relations.  Educators are urged to: 
(1) reach out to parents, (2) focus on parents of young children, (3) educate 
and involve health care and other professionals, use educational flexibility, 
and establish parent discussion groups.  (Contains 13 references.) (DB)<BR>
