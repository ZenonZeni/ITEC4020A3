</CENTER>
<p>
<b>AFGHANISTAN</b><p>
<p>
Widespread forced entry into homes and looting occurred in the northern cities
of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz early in the year during intense fighting there.
There were fewer reports of looting in Kabul compared with 1993, probably
because much of the city was in ruins and many items of value had already been
carried off.  A U.N. facility in Mazar-i-Sharif and the Pakistani Embassy in
Kabul were ransacked in early 1994.  The Afghanistan National Archives were
looted in May.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ALBANIA</b><p>
<p>
The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that Albania guarantees "the
human rights and fundamental freedoms as accepted in international documents."
The Law on Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights addresses protections
associated with privacy, family, home, and correspondence.<p>
<p>
Although Article 16 provides for protection of the home from arbitrary entry or
search, the Penal Code permits warrantless searches for weapons.  Article 17
calls for privacy of correspondence except "for a judgment in the interest of
criminal proceedings or by the approval of a competent government body,
assigned by law, in cases where it (encroachment) is considered indispensable
for reasons of national security."<p>
<p>
The Government is considering plans to open and examine the files of the
Sigurimi (the former secret police of the Communist regime), but no legislation
has been passed, and the files remain under the control of the SHIK.  Senior
government officials have indicated that not all files are intact and some may
have been tampered with in the final days of the Communist regime.  The AHC is
concerned that information from the files may have been used for political
purposes and protested the lack of legislation on their disposition.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ALGERIA</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the state
of emergency authorizes regional governors to issue exceptional search warrants
at any time.  Security forces often enter residences illegally.  The Government
fails to ensure that the police adhere to lawful procedures for entering houses
or monitoring correspondence.  In addition, there were increasingly frequent
incidents of entry into private homes by armed opposition elements, either to
kidnap residents or to steal weapons or valuables.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ANDORRA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides safeguards against arbitrary interference with
"privacy, honor, and reputation," and the authorities honor these.  No searches
of any private premises may be conducted without a juridically issued warrant.
The law also protects private communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ANGOLA</b><p>
<p>
The Government routinely maintains surveillance of certain groups, such as
UNITA and other opposition National Assembly deputies, opposition party
leaders, known or suspected Angolan or foreign UNITA sympathizers, and foreign
diplomats.  The law requires judicial search warrants, and in practice the law
is respected.  However, as far as known there were no search warrants issued
before the roundup of Lebanese and other foreign businessmen in 1993.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The Constitution provides for these rights, and there were no reports of
arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.  The
police must obtain a warrant from an officer of the court before searching
private premises.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ARGENTINA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits the Government from interfering in the private lives
of its citizens, and the Government rarely does so.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ARMENIA</b><p>
<p>
Apart from the provisions of the International Covenant, there is no legal
protection for the privacy of citizens, their communications, and their
correspondence.  Procedurally, the Directorate of National Security must
petition the General Prosecutor's office for permission to tap a phone or
intercept correspondence.  The General Prosecutor's office purportedly must
find a compelling need for a wiretap before it will grant the agency permission
to proceed.  One of the leading opposition parties claimed to have discovered
unauthorized wiretaps on its office telephones, but there was no official
investigation of these allegations.<p>
<p>
There were many instances of interference with privacy during waves of army
conscription in 1994.  Military recruiters appeared at houses where draft-age
men were reported to live and often threatened or detained the occupants or
inflicted material damage.  They seized draft-age men in public places, such as
markets, theaters, and the subway.  There are credible reports that Armenian
and Nagorno-Karabakh officials forcibly conscripted refugees from
Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>AUSTRALIA</b><p>
<p>
By law, the authorities may not conduct searches without a judicially issued
warrant, and in practice they do not do so.  The Government respects the
privacy of family, home, and correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>AUSTRIA</b><p>
<p>
The law provides for the protection of personal data collected, processed, or
transmitted by government agencies, public institutions, or private entities.
The Constitution protects the secrecy of mail and telephone communications.  A
1991 law introduced permanent parliamentary control over the state police and
the military secret service.  Parliamentary subcommittees to oversee these
organs were established in September 1993.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>AZERBAIJAN</b><p>
<p>
The Soviet surveillance apparatus, reorganized as the Ministry of National
Security, became more active than under the previous Elcibey government.  It is
widely and credibly believed that the Ministry taps telephones, especially
those of foreigners and prominent political and business figures.  The police
have periodically raided the offices of opposition press and political parties
on the grounds of a search for illicit weapons.  The post-October emergency
legislation, extended in December by the legislature until early February 1995,
made explicit the right to conduct such searches.  The police also make
periodic sweeps in search of young men evading the draft.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE BAHAMAS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure.  The law
usually requires a court order for entry into or search of a private residence,
but a police inspector or more senior police official may authorize a search
without a court order where probable cause of a weapons violation exists.  Such
an official may also authorize the search of a person (which extends to the
vehicle in which the person is traveling) without a court order should probable
cause exist for drug possession.  The Government neither censors mail nor
restricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BAHRAIN</b><p>
<p>
The law empowers the Ministry of Interior to authorize entry into private
premises without specific judicial authorization.  The authorities monitor some
domestic and international telephone calls and correspondence.  Police informer
networks are extensive and sophisticated.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BANGLADESH</b><p>
<p>
The law requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a
home.  However, human rights monitors assert that the police rarely obtain
warrants and officers violating the procedure are not punished.<p>
<p>
In addition, the SPA permits searches without a warrant.  Some opposition
members and CHT tribal leaders maintain that the intelligence services
illegally monitor their telephones and mail.  Sheikh Hasina, leader of the
opposition Awami League, charged that the Government taps her telephones and
has her under surveillance.  The Government denied tapping her telephone, but
admitted that the "surveillance" was provided for her protection.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BARBADOS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law
requires warrants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered
and searched.  The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives
of its citizens.  Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in
response to increased drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of
homes in certain neighborhoods, sometimes without warrants.  The Government
neither censors mail nor restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or
publications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BELARUS</b><p>
<p>
Electronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continued.  The
KDB, the MVS, and certain border guard detachments have the right to request
permission to install wiretaps but must legally obtain a prosecutor's
permission before installing it.  Except in cases of pursuit, a prosecutorial
search warrant is needed in order to enter a private home.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>BELGIUM</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Freedom from arbitrary state interference with privacy is guaranteed by law and
respected in practice.  Search warrants issued by a judge are required unless
the inhabitants of a domicile agree to a search.<p>
<p>
In 1994 Parliament passed legislation under which law enforcement officials may
apply to a magistrate for permission to use wiretaps.  Permission is generally
granted only for limited periods of time and only for the investigation of
major crimes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BELIZE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the protection of personal property, privacy of
home and person, and recognition of human dignity, and the Government generally
honors these provisions.  The law requires police to obtain judicial warrants
before searching private property, except when they have a reasonable suspicion
that a crime is being committed and do not have time to obtain a warrant.  The
police observe this requirement in practice.  Customs officers do not need a
warrant to search private property.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BENIN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for, and the Government respected in practice, the
inviolability of private property and the home, as well as the privacy of
personal correspondence and communications.  Police are required to obtain a
judicial warrant before entering a private home, a requirement observed in
practice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BHUTAN</b><p>
<p>
There are no laws providing for these rights, but cultural traditions are
highly respectful of personal privacy.  However, the Government has undermined
these traditions by its emphasis on promoting national integration.  For
example, a royal decree issued in 1989 made Drukpa national dress compulsory
for all citizens.  Anyone found violating the decree may be fined or sentenced
to jail for a week.  Although observance of the decree is lax, there are
occasional drives to stiffen enforcement, which exposes ethnic Nepalese to
intimidation.  According to human rights groups, police regularly conduct
house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without explanation or legal
justification.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BOLIVIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of
citizens' lives, and the Government usually respected these provisions.  There
were credible allegations of UMOPAR abuses, including thefts of property from
homes and illegal searches.  Opponents charged that security services conducted
illegal phone taps and other surveillance; these charges could not be
confirmed.  The Government respects the rights of individuals to determine
family size, religion, and political affiliations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA</b><p>
<p>
The Republic's Constitution provides for the right to privacy, protection of
the family and of children, and property.  Governmental respect for these
rights was the rule rather than the exception in 1994.  Bosnian authorities
attempted to monitor communications that impinged on military or other national
security concerns.<p>
<p>
Local Serbian authorities in Serb-occupied territories in Sarajevo, such as
Grbavica, instituted a policy of summarily confiscating the property of
mixed-marriage couples with sons who had either fled abroad or to Federation
territory.  According to a credible observer, Serbian authorities in Grbavica
threatened to confiscate the property of a mixed Serb-Muslim family whose son
fled from Grbavica to Bosnian-controlled Sarajevo and who was dating a loyalist
Serb, if the son did not return to fight for a "Greater Serbia."  There are
five other mixed families living in the same building with sons who have fled,
who also were threatened with having their property confiscated unless their
sons acceded to the draft.<p>
<p>
The persistence of the Serbian policy of ethnic cleansing constituted sustained
arbitrary interference with family and home.  Serbs continued to enter Bosnian
and Croatian homes in Serb-held territory without search warrants.  In the
towns of Banja Luka, Bijeljina, and Rogatica, the pattern of ethnic cleansing
usually began with unauthorized entry into non-Serb homes by the BSA, Serbian
police, or other paramilitary forces who demanded weapons and threatened
residents with violence if they did not leave.  In the village of Janja, in the
Bijeljina township, Serbs regularly placed Serbian refugee families in Muslim
homes, forcing the owners to live in one room.  In general, in Serb-occupied
Bosnia, police powers were intrusive and only minimally restricted by law or
custom.  Letters carried through Serbian lines were regularly opened.<p>
<p>
In addition to forcible eviction, extortion, and robbery, Bosnian Serb
authorities routinely harassed and terrorized non-Serbs in Serb-held
territories by breaking into homes with dynamite and threatening to blow up the
occupants; by destroying graveyards so that deceased family members had to be
buried in family gardens; and by destroying farm animals and crops to starve
out the population.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BOTSWANA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the
person, and the Government respects these rights.  While judicial search
warrants are normally required, police officers above the rank of sergeant may
enter, search, and seize property if they have reasonable grounds to suspect
that evidence might be destroyed or that a crime is in progress.  Evidence
gathered without a search warrant is admissible in court, but judges may and do
disqualify such evidence if it can be shown that the police had time to obtain
a warrant.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BRAZIL</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home.
There were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry
into homes without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects.  A
women's rights group in the city of Porto Alegre reported suspected police
involvement in five break-ins at its offices--each time its files on spousal
abuse and finances were ransacked.  Wiretaps are unconstitutional except when
authorized by a judicial authority for purposes of criminal investigation and
prosecution.  The inviolability of private correspondence is respected.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BRUNEI</b><p>
<p>
Although the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual
persons, families, or homes, this rarely happens.  There are sporadic reports
of mail having been opened prior to delivery.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BULGARIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for inviolability of the home, protects the freedom
and confidentiality of correspondence, and provides for the right to choose
one's place of work and residence.  Parliament passed a bill in June regulating
the activities of the NSS, which is responsible for civilian
counterintelligence.  The law allows the Interior Minister to authorize
electronic surveillance for up to 24 hours without informing other government
agencies, if he determines there is imminent danger to national security.  Some
human rights groups asserted that the Government has carried out unjustified
surveillance of religious groups and of the outlawed Macedonian group
UMO-Ilinden (see Section 2.b.).  Labor leader Krustyo Petkov charged that
security services monitored union activities during the period before a
threatened general strike in May.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BURKINA FASO</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities
generally do not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens.  In
national security cases, however, a special law permits surveillance, searches
and monitoring of telephones and private correspondence without a warrant.  By
law and under normal circumstances, homes may be searched only with the
authority of a warrant issued by the Minister of Justice.  Except in certain
cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling dens, such warrants must be
executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BURMA</b><p>
<p>
The military rules unchecked by any outside authority and the State continued
to interfere extensively and arbitrarily into the lives of private citizens.
Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored
the travel, whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those
known to be politically active.  Security personnel selectively screened
private correspondence and telephone calls and conducted warrantless searches
of private premises.  Government employees were required to obtain advance
permission before meeting with foreigners.<p>
<p>
The SLORC continued to move people out of cities to peripheral new town
settlements throughout the country, albeit on a smaller scale than in past
years.  While facilities in some of these areas have improved over time,
residents targeted for displacement continued to be given no option but to
move, usually on short notice.  The military also continued to forcibly
relocate villages in rural areas, especially those with large ethnic minority
populations.<p>
<p>
Also, those able to remain in established cities and towns were subject to
arbitrary seizure of their property.  Many residents of Mandalay were compelled
early in the year to cede large parcels of prime downtown real estate to the
authorities for road-widening projects decided upon without any public
consultation or endorsement.  Widespread reports indicate the Mandalay city
government threatened to charge demolition costs to those in affected areas who
wavered in tearing down their own homes.  Beyond these seizures for public
purposes there were consistent reports of pressure being applied to force
individuals to cede parts of their property to government or military
officials, in some cases for these officials' personal use.  Automobiles and
other movable property also remained vulnerable to arbitrary seizure.  In rural
areas, military personnel confiscated livestock and food supplies during
periodic sweeps to procure porters.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BURUNDI</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and the authorities
generally respect the law requiring search warrants.  Security forces can
monitor telephones and are commonly assumed to do so.<p>
<p>
<b>CAMBODIA</b><p>
<p>
According to human rights observers, the police routinely make arrests and
conduct searches without warrants.  However, the number of forced entries into
homes and offices decreased, after a high incidence during the 1993 political
campaign.  Reports of surveillance continued, but decreased as the security
apparatus of the SOC continued to be dismantled.  According to newspaper
reports, the Government often monitored private citizens' telephone calls and
asked telephone companies for records of conversations.  There were no reported
incidences of forced political party membership.  Persons in Khmer Rouge zones
are subject to rigid social controls and accorded no right to privacy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CAMEROON</b><p>
<p>
Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal, but
there were numerous credible reports that police and gendarmes harassed
citizens and conducted searches without warrants.  Security forces, including
police, frequently set up roadblocks to extract bribes from travelers.  This
longstanding practice appears to have increased as the economy declined.  In
June a high-ranking CPDM official involved in a commercial dispute with a
foreign citizen, rather than resolve his dispute through legal means, employed
the police to seize the citizen's property unlawfully.  The foreign citizen
then sought redress through the courts.  At year's end, the dispute remained
before the courts without resolution.<p>
<p>
On August 23, the national police breached accepted diplomatic immunity in
forcibly entering U.S. Government diplomatic property (USAID and Administrative
Compound) in Yaounde, removing three vehicles and miscellaneous items.  The
bailiff claimed he had authority to seize the property pursuant to a court
decision.  The bailiff also claimed to have an order of execution (warrant)
signed by the Attorney General.  Police and bailiffs again forcibly entered the
grounds on August 26 and again attempted to seize U.S. Government property.
The Embassy in both instances protested vigorously this violation of diplomatic
immunity and twice received high-level apologies.  Government officials
repeatedly promised that the vehicles would be returned to the Embassy, but at
year's end their return was still pending.<p>
<p>
There were numerous credible reports that the Government kept some opposition
activists and dissidents under surveillance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CANADA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution affords Canadians strong legal protection from arbitrary
interference, and federal and provincial governments generally do not interfere
with an individual's basic rights without due process.  Intrusive searches may
be carried out only when there is a demonstrable, reasonable basis for
presuming the affected person is involved in criminal activity.  Police
officials face judicial penalties for abuse of a person's privacy if they do
not obtain a judicial search warrant in advance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CAPE VERDE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, correspondence,
and other means of communication, and the Government respects these rights in
practice.  The law requires a judicial warrant before homes may be searched.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of the home without
a warrant in civil and criminal cases.  Title IV of the Penal Code, which
covers certain political and security cases, allows police to search private
property without written authorization.  Early in the year, police conducted
such searches as part of investigations into illegal weapons caches.  In at
least one other attempt, when the police did not invoke national security
provisions, irate neighbors thwarted a politically inspired search.  The
Government used telephone monitoring to maintain a close watch on opposition
figures.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CHAD</b><p>
<p>
The Transitional Charter provides for citizens' rights to privacy of home and
correspondence, freedom from arbitrary arrest and search, and liberties of
association.  The Penal Code further stipulates that police may search homes
only during daylight hours and only with a legal warrant.  In practice,
security forces conducted searches without legal warrant, day and night.  In
some cases, they mistreated and extorted money from their victims.<p>
<p>
The Government also engaged in telephone surveillance of its citizens without
judicial supervision.<p>
<p>
<b>CHILE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits searches of the home and  interception of private
communications, unless either a civilian or military court issues a search
warrant for specific locations.  The 1984 antiterrorist law allows court
supervised surveillance of those suspected of terrorist crimes, and for the
interception, opening, or recording of private communications and documents in
such cases.  Privacy laws do not permit the release of telephone records nor
the use of caller identification services.<p>
<p>
Since the return to civilian rule, there have been a number of incidents
involving supposed espionage.  In a 1992 political eavesdropping scandal, it
was clear that an army unit was recording cellular telephone conversations of
political leaders of all persuasions, including members of Congress.  While it
is against stated government policy to engage in this kind of political
espionage, it is not clear whether or not it continues.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CHINA</b><p>
<p>
Changes in the economic structure, including the growing diversity of
employment opportunities and the increasing market orientation of many work
units, are undermining the ability of the authorities to monitor and regulate
personal and family life as closely as in the past, particularly in rural
areas.  In urban areas, however, most people still depend on their
government-linked work unit for housing, permission to have a child, approval
to apply for a passport, and other aspects of ordinary life.  The work unit,
along with the neighborhood committee, is charged with monitoring activities
and attitudes.<p>
<p>
Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can search
premises, this provision is often ignored.  In addition, both the Public
Security Bureau and procuracy apparently can issue search warrants on their own
authority.  The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of
correspondence of citizens ... are protected by law," but in practice,
authorities record some telephone conversations and some mail is opened and
censored.  Government security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contact
between foreigners and Chinese citizens, particularly dissidents.  Rules issued
in July implementing the State Security Law define "activities of individuals
outside the country (including non-Chinese citizens resident in China) who
disregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country who have endangered
state security or who are seriously suspected of endangering state security" as
a violation of the State Security Law.<p>
<p>
The Government has continued its effort to control citizens' access to outside
sources of information, selectively jamming Chinese language broadcasts of the
Voice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation.  The effectiveness
of the jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA and
other broadcasters reaching most parts of China.<p>
<p>
China's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years to 1.18 billion
people.  In the 1970's and 1980's, China adopted a comprehensive and highly
intrusive one-child family planning policy.  This policy most heavily affects
Han Chinese in urban areas.  Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have a
second child.  However, exceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han who
live in rural areas, and ethnic minorities are subject to less stringent
population controls.  Enforcement of the family planning policy is
inconsistent, varying widely from place to place and year to year.<p>
<p>
The population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic
incentives, as well as more coercive measures, including psychological pressure
and economic penalties.  Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include
monthly stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits.
Disciplinary measures against those who violate the policy include fines,
withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments,
such as loss of employment.  Unpaid fines have sometimes resulted in
confiscation or destruction of personal property.  Because penalties for excess
births can be levied against local officials and the mothers' work units, many
individuals are affected, providing multiple sources of pressure.<p>
<p>
Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is not authorized,
but Chinese officials acknowledge privately that there are instances of forced
abortions and sterilizations.  Officials maintain that, when discovered,
responsible officials are disciplined and undergo retraining.  They admit,
however, that stronger punishment is rare.  Individuals can also sue officials
who have exceeded their authority in implementing family planning policy, but
government officials have not provided data on the number of successful suits
on these grounds.<p>
<p>
Regulations forbid sex-selective abortion, but because of the traditional
preference for male children, particularly in rural areas, some families have
used ultrasound to identify and abort female fetuses.  Use of ultrasound for
this purpose was specifically prohibited by the Maternal and Child Health Law
passed in October, which prescribes penalties for medical practitioners who
violate this provision.  The Chinese press has reported that the ratio of male
to female births is 114 to 100, based on a nationwide average, while the
statistical norm is 106 male births to 100 female.  The ratio excludes many
female births, especially the second or third in a family, which are unreported
to permit the parents to keep trying to conceive a boy, but may also reflect
the abuse of sonography.  Female infanticide may also be a factor in some areas
of China.<p>
<p>
At least five provincial governments have implemented regulations seeking to
prevent people with severe mental handicaps from having children.  In October
China passed a national Maternal and Child Care Law calling for premarital and
prenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute infectious
diseases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are
at risk for passing on debilitating genetic diseases.  The law goes into effect
on June 1, 1995, and implementing regulations defining which diseases or
conditions will be covered have not yet been completed.  The law will be
implemented by the Ministry of Health, not the State Family Planning
Commission, and while it includes provisions for abortion or sterilization in
some cases based on medical advice, it provides for obtaining a second opinion
and mandates that patients or their guardians give written consent to such
procedures.  (See also Section 5 on People with Disabilities.)<p>
<p>
There were no reported cases of prosecution of parents for teaching their
children religion in the privacy of their home.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COLOMBIA</b><p>
<p>
The law generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private
home, except in cases of hot pursuit.  In remote regions of the country, the
military forces have civilian prosecutorial units delegated to them.  Human
rights groups charged that these delegate units were unconstitutional, and
Congress refused to grant them permanent status.  Nonetheless, there were
credible reports that they continued to function, often facilitating army
searches with little regard for judicious issuance of search warrants.  In one
example, the Nueva Granada battalion carried out over 60 searches and
detentions in the rural areas surrounding Barrancabermeja between January and
March.  Many of the detainees reported that soldiers mistreated and unjustly
interrogated them.<p>
<p>
A judge must authorize telephone wiretaps and the interception of mail.  This
protection extends to prisoners incarcerated in the penal system.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COMOROS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and property.  There
were no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CONGO</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution protects the privacy of homes as well as correspondence and
telecommunications.  Official searches of private properties and communications
require a warrant, but in practice warrants are not uniformly served.  There is
widespread belief that the Government continues to tap telephones.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COSTA RICA</b><p>
<p>
There were no reports of extralegal invasions of privacy conducted by, or with
the knowledge of, the Government.  The law requires judicial warrants to search
private homes, and police seldom fail to comply.  In August the Legislative
Assembly approved legislation permitting government-authorized wiretaps in
certain restricted circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COTE D'IVOIRE</b><p>
<p>
The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative
magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is
reason to believe that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime.
The official must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized
in the search and is required to have witnesses to the search, which may not
take place between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.  In practice, police sometimes use a
general search warrant without a name or address.  On occasion, police have
entered homes of non-Ivorian Africans (or rounded them up on the streets),
taken them to local police stations, and extorted small amounts of money for
alleged minor offenses.<p>
<p>
Security forces have reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations,
but the extent of the practice is unknown.  There is no evidence that private
written correspondence is monitored.<p>
<p>
In Cote d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are free to join, or
not join, any political party.  However, the State has reportedly transferred
government employees (e.g., teachers) active in the opposition because of their
political activities.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CROATIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution declares the home inviolable.  Only a court may issue a search
warrant, stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises.
Police may enter a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if
necessary to enforce an arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious
danger to life or important property.  In practice, the authorities often
failed to adhere to these constitutional requirements.<p>
<p>
Military or civil police carried out evictions by force, involving several
hundred families, ethnic Serbs and Croats as well as Muslims.  In Split, 230
families were reported to be seeking through the courts to remove soldiers who
had seized their apartments.  Almost all of these cases involved apartments
previously owned by the JNA, over which the Ministry of Defense asserted
ownership.  Referring to property laws which remove tenancy rights as a result
of any 6-month absence or if the tenant is ruled to have acted against the
interests of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense granted soldiers tenancy of
occupied flats.  The soldiers then frequently took residences by force of arms,
either evicting the current tenants or forcing them to cohabitate.<p>
<p>
During the year, human rights organizations became increasingly effective at
calling public attention to forced evictions, and their members turned up in
large numbers at the announced time of the eviction.  But in at least two
cases, police beat and injured human rights monitors seeking to obstruct an
eviction.  In May the Defense Ministry issued public orders to remove any
soldiers who had illegally forced their way into an apartment, using force if
necessary.  But military police never carried out these orders, reporting
privately to observers that their commanders had told them to refrain from
arresting the soldiers.  The tenants of these apartments were typically Serbian
families or the spouses and children of Serbs in the JNA who had left Croatia.
At a July 12 press conference, President Tudjman justified the forced evictions
by linking them to the Serbian aggression against Croatia and eviction of
one-quarter million Croats.<p>
<p>
The Constitution guarantees the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it was
unclear if such guarantees were adhered to in practice.<p>
<p>
Serbian authorities in the UNPA's showed no compunction about interfering with
the privacy rights of the inhabitants of those areas, particularly non-Serbs.
UNPROFOR continued to provide 24-hour patrols of several minority villages to
protect the inhabitants from armed bands.  The practice of forcibly moving
Serbian refugees or soldiers into the homes of non-Serb residents continued as
well, which was clearly designed to pressure the non-Serbs to leave.  One
couple in Sector West was forced to live in their pantry after Serbian soldiers
took over the remainder of the house and Serbian refugees moved into their
outbuildings.  Inhabitants were even denied the right to talk on the telephone,
with the authorities putting severe restrictions on international observers who
provided mobile telephones to villagers during visits to permit them to call
relatives on the other side of the line.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CUBA</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and
correspondence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by
government-controlled mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of the
most pervasive and repressive features of Cuban life.  The State has assumed
the right to interfere in the lives of citizens, even those who do not actively
oppose the Government and its practices.  The Communist Party controls the mass
organizations which permeate society, although to a lesser extent than in the
past because of the collapsing economy.  Their ostensible purpose is to
"improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is to discover and discourage
nonconformity.<p>
<p>
The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls.  The educational
system teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all other
commitments.  In September Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegret
affirmed that commitment to the revolution, including a willingness to defend
the revolution in the streets, was a condition for admission to the university.
The Ministry of Education requires teachers to evaluate students' ideological
character and note it in records the students carry throughout their schooling,
which affect their future educational and career prospects.<p>
<p>
The Interior Ministry employs an intricate system of informants and block
committees (the CDR's) to monitor and control public opinion.  Guardians of
social conformity, CDR's are neighborhood security committees tasked with
closely monitoring the daily lives of residents.  CDR's often report on
suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings--
including those with foreigners--and defiant attitudes toward the Government
and the revolution.<p>
<p>
State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseas
telephone calls and conversations with foreigners.  Citizens do not have the
right to receive publications from abroad.  Security agents subject dissidents,
foreign diplomats, and journalists to surveillance.  In March the Government
lodged a formal complaint against two U.S. diplomats for distributing enemy
propaganda; the diplomats had given a few copies of a Miami newspaper to fellow
passengers on a train to Santa Clara.<p>
<p>
The authorities regularly search people and their homes without probable cause
to intimidate and harass them.  In August police searched the home of Pastor
Herrera, a leader of the human rights group "Alternative Criteria," and
confiscated written human rights allegations, membership information, copies of
a Miami newspaper, and Herrera's appointment pass to visit the U.S. Interests
Section.<p>
<p>
The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited
the U.S. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rights
abuses, and seized copies of U.S. newspapers and other informational materials.
Police stopped two women, Isabel del Pino and Maria Valdes Rosado of the
dissident religious group "Christ the King" on March 9, took them to a nearby
police station, and subjected them to a strip search.  Police carefully
searched their belongings and confiscated reports of human rights violations
they had written.  Two state security officials then threatened them with
arrest if they did not stop their activities.  In November the authorities
detained several activists following their meetings with a visiting Spanish
official.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CYPRUS</b><p>
<p>
Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot
community include provisions protecting the individual against arbitrary
interference by the authorities.  A judicial warrant is required for a police
official to enter a private residence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CZECH REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
Electronic surveillance, telephone tapping, and interception of mail require a
court order, and the Government complies with this requirement.  There were no
known cases of electronic surveillance reported in 1994.  There were no reports
of arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DENMARK</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution stipulates that without a court order there can be no
searching of any home, surveillance of any individual, seizure of any paper, or
breaching of the confidentiality of any communication.  The Government respects
these prohibitions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DJIBOUTI</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home,
correspondence, and communications.  However, the Government monitors the
communications of regime opponents, including opposition party and Afar
leaders.  Warrants are required for the authorities to conduct searches on
private property.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DOMINICA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and seizure.  The law
requires search warrants.  While there were no official reports of arbitrary
government intrusions into the private lives of individuals, human rights
monitors allege that the authorities often searched young men with little or no
probable cause in drug-related inspections.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not arbitrarily interfere with the private lives of persons
or families and generally observes constitutional provisions against invasion
of the home.  The authorities may not search a residence except in the presence
of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, in instances of "hot pursuit," or
when there is probable cause to believe that a crime is in progress.  During
the 1994 electoral campaign and the post-electoral crisis, there were numerous
credible allegations of widescale interception of telephone conversations and
surveillance of individuals which may have involved the Government as well as
political parties.  In addition, opposition politicians charged that government
raids on their homes, ostensibly to search for firearms, were politically
motivated.  They also charged that the security service officials who rounded
up many of the detainees mentioned in Section 1.d. employed illegal raids on
their homes to capture them.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ECUADOR</b><p>
<p>
The law requires police to have a warrant to enter a private home or business,
except in the case of hot pursuit.  The police generally respect the sanctity
of private homes and correspondence.  Police surveillance is permitted, but the
Constitution prohibits wiretapping, and the results of a wiretap are not
admissible as evidence in court.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>EGYPT</b><p>
<p>
In 1994 there continued to be substantial abridgment, under the Emergency Law,
of constitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy.  Under the
Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of
communication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be
guaranteed." Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and
wiretaps.  Courts have dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without
sufficient cause.  Police officials who conduct searches without proper
warrants are subject to criminal penalties, although these are seldom
imposed.<p>
<p>
The Emergency Law empowers the State to search persons or places without
warrants.  Security agencies frequently place political activists, suspected
subversives, journalists, and writers under surveillance, screen their
correspondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes,
and confiscate personal property.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>EL SALVADOR</b><p>
<p>
According to the Constitution, the police must have the resident's consent, a
warrant, or a reasonable belief that a crime is being or is about to be
committed, before entering a private dwelling.  In practice, however, the
authorities used forced entry to carry out arrests and investigations.
Wiretapping of telephone communications by the Government, private persons, and
political parties is illegal but occurs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>EQUATORIAL GUINEA</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants and
security forces conduct arbitrary searches of homes.<p>
<p>
The Government does not overtly force officials to join the DPEG, but lawyers,
government staff, and others understand that party membership is necessary for
employment and promotion.<p>
<p>
There is reportedly some surveillance of members of the opposition parties.
There does not appear to be systematic interference with correspondence, and
there is no coercive population control or forced resettlement.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ERITREA</b><p>
<p>
Under the Criminal Code, warrants are required to monitor mail, telephones, or
other means of communication.  Warrants are required in routine searches and
seizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may attempt to
escape or destroy evidence.  In the past this restriction has often not been
observed, but there were no reports of illegal surveillance or searches in
1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ESTONIA</b><p>
<p>
Estonian law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property.
Prosecutors, rather than judges, issue such warrants during the investigative
stage upon a showing of probable cause.  Once a case has gone to trial,
however, judges then issue search and seizure warrants.<p>
<p>
The Constitution guarantees secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and
other means of communication.  Police must obtain a court order to intercept a
person's communications.  Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in
court.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ETHIOPIA</b><p>
<p>
The law requires judicial search warrants, but government critics allege they
are seldom used in practice.  The TGE implemented a nationwide campaign to
uncover and confiscate unregistered firearms.  Government security officials
conducted searches of private and commercial vehicles, as well as private
homes.  Leaders of political opposition groups claim their members have been
singled out for illegal searches and often unfairly detained during this
campaign.  These charges were given additional credibility when 44 of 46 ENDP
members, detained following accusations of illegal weapons possession in the
Southern Ethiopian People's Region, were subsequently released without charge
(see Section 1.d.).  Many people allege they are under surveillance for
expressing antigovernment views.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>FIJI</b><p>
<p>
In general, privacy of the home is respected.  However, the Intelligence
Service has powers to search people and property, open mail, and tap telephones
when a warrant is issued by the National Security Council, within specific
operational guidelines outlined in the government decree which created it.  The
Intelligence Service does conduct surveillance of persons it believes represent
a security threat.  Some political dissidents believe their telephones and mail
are monitored, but they have not provided substantiating evidence.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>FINLAND</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The law provides for the right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, and it
specifically prohibits eavesdropping and mail tampering.  The authorities fully
respect these provisions.  The law authorizes police to conduct wiretapping
under certain conditions of suspected criminal activity.  Senior police
officials, rather than judges, have the authority to issue search warrants;
there is no indication this power is abused.  By law, the police are subject to
judicial scrutiny.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>FRANCE</b><p>
<p>
French law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and the authorities
respect this.  Police must obtain a judicial warrant in order to search a
private residence, except when responding to a crime in progress.  They can
conduct such a search only between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., except in special
circumstances such as a crime in progress or a drug case.  Telephone
conversations may be monitored only under a court order in conjunction with
criminal proceedings, except in national security cases.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GABON</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides protection from surveillance, from searches without
warrant, and from interference with private telecommunications or
correspondence.  As part of criminal investigations, police may issue search
warrants, which are easily obtainable and often granted after the fact.  The
Government has used them to gain access to the homes of opposition figures and
their families.  Government authorities also routinely monitor private
telephone conversations, personal mail, and the movements of citizens.  Human
rights monitors, opposition figures, union leaders, foreign diplomats, and even
members of the Government have all reported being followed, watched, or
otherwise monitored by authorities at various times.<p>
<p>
The state of alert in effect from the beginning of the year until April 10
imposed a curfew and granted the Government numerous extralegal powers to limit
an individual's constitutional rights.  Security forces routinely entered and
searched private homes, offices, and vehicles without a warrant during this
period.  In February government troops attacked and ransacked an opposition
radio station and the homes of two leading opposition politicians (see Section
2.a.), confiscating or destroying a considerable amount of property.<p>
<p>
After August, when most of the reshuffling of personnel within ministries was
complete, there were no further confirmed reports of dismissal of government or
military personnel due to political affiliation.  One of the opposition's
negotiating demands in pursuit of a government of national unity was
reinstatement of persons so dismissed.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE GAMBIA</b><p>
<p>
Although constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search remain in place,
AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override
these safeguards.  Police seized private documents and property without due
process and placed armed guards at homes and other properties suspected of
having been acquired with embezzled or misappropriated funds.  The AFPRC froze
accounts of persons under suspicion and prohibited by decree the transfer of
their property.  It denied persons under house arrest access to international
telephone service.  Police must generally have court orders to conduct searches
related to crimes unless the individual concerned agrees or it is deemed to
involve an urgent matter of national interest.  The Government has not
generally intruded in family matters, and this has remained true under the
AFPRC.  Security officials are believed to monitor telephone communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GEORGIA</b><p>
<p>
Intelligence agencies, including both Georgian and Russian services, are
credibly reported to monitor private telephone conversations.  Prior to his
assassination, Gia Chanturia, the head of the National Democratic Party,
complained publicly that his office was electronically monitored.<p>
<p>
Both paramilitary and law enforcement representatives enter homes without legal
sanction.  However, most Soviet-era forms of interference diminished.<p>
<p>
Telephone communications with Abkhazia and South Ossetia are almost impossible
because local authorities exercise control over them.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GERMANY</b><p>
<p>
The Basic Law provides for inviolability of the home, and the authorities
respect these provisions.  Prior to forcibly entering a home, police must
obtain a warrant from a judge or, in an emergency, a public prosecutor.  For
electronic surveillance of telephone lines or monitoring of mail, police must
obtain a court order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GHANA</b><p>
<p>
Observers assume the Government continues to engage in surveillance of citizens
engaged in activity which it deems objectionable.  In the past, this included
monitoring of telephones and mail.<p>
<p>
Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not always obtain
them.  The Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference
within the privacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication.
This article has yet to be tested.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GREECE</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without
warrants, and the law permits monitoring personal communications only under
strict judicial controls, the variety of persons and groups subjected to
government surveillance in recent years raises questions about safeguards.
Targets included human rights monitors, non- Orthodox religious groups, and
activist members of minority groups.<p>
<p>
In June a parliamentary investigation committee recommended indictment of
former Prime Minister Mitsotakis and 30 persons from the former Mitsotakis
administration on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989 to 1991.
In January 1995, the Parliament voted to drop all charges against Mitsotakis.
The others will be tried in criminal courts in 1995.<p>
<p>
The security services continued to monitor human rights and minority group
representatives and foreign diplomats who met with such individuals.  Human
rights monitors also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and
diversions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently
published in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services.  So far
as is known, the Government took no steps to stop such practices or to
prosecute those involved.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GRENADA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were no
reports of such actions.  The law generally requires judicially issued warrants
for searching homes, except in cases of hot pursuit.  The Firearms Act of 1968
and the Drug Abuse Prevention Act No. 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions which
give the police and security units legal authority to search persons and
property without warrants in certain circumstances.  In practice, police obtain
warrants in the majority of cases before conducting any search.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUATEMALA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and
private documents, but the authorities do not always respect these provisions.
Elements of the security forces continue to monitor private communications.
Many human rights monitors reported receiving threats in the form of
surveillance, telephone calls, and anonymous letters.<p>
<p>
On March 11, a year after an arrest warrant had been issued, Juan Jose Garcia
Orellana, a postal control officer charged with operating a mail espionage ring
in the post office for the presidential security staff under the Serrano
administration, turned himself in to judicial authorities.  The authorities are
still gathering evidence in this case.<p>
<p>
Through July, officials enforcing the military draft continued to stop vehicles
and enter homes and places of business without legally required court orders.
Prior to August, under recruitment practices adopted in some departments,
potential draftees receive three induction notices, after which they are
arrested if they do not report for enlistment.  Under the law, such arrests
must be effected pursuant to a court order.<p>
<p>
On June 14, Amilcar Mendez, the founder of CERJ, filed a lawsuit against
Defense Minister Enriquez charging that the armed forces' forced recruitment
practices violated constitutional provisions regarding obligatory military
service.  However, a court ruled the judicial branch did not have jurisdiction
over this matter because the Minister of Defense had immunity from prosecution,
which only Congress could remove.  It referred the immunity question to the
Congress, which ruled that the case lacked legal merit, thus effectively
dismissing the entire lawsuit.<p>
<p>
Through July 30, the Archbishop's human rights office handled 89 individual
cases of forced recruitment.  In the same period, the Human Rights Ombudsman's
office reported receiving 663 complaints of forced recruitment.  The office
obtained the release of 268 persons from military service, of whom 79 were
minors.  On June 29, Defense Minister General Enriquez announced a 6-month
moratorium on forced recruitment, which was confirmed by President De Leon
during the June 30 Army Day celebrations.  However, the Ombudsman reported
three separate instances of forced conscription in July.  On August 28, the
Defense Ministry once again ordered a suspension of forced recruitment; since
then, there were no further reports of forced recruitment.  The army has
continued the practice of setting up draft boards consisting of the zone
military commander, the local representative of the Human Rights Ombudsman's
office, and other civilian leaders.<p>
<p>
The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary.  However, army
officers, military commissioners, and PAC leaders often pressure men in areas
of conflict to become members.  Nevertheless, PAC's do appear to enjoy some
popular support; a majority of respondents in a recent academic survey
conducted for the Human Rights Ombudsman in seven departments claimed to be
pleased with the PAC membership and with the PAC presence in their communities.
However, some human rights monitors have charged that PAC members may have felt
intimidated by fellow PAC members and did not give completely candid answers.<p>
<p>
In June and July, CERJ filed a legal complaint on behalf of former PAC member
Juan Antonio Chumel with local judicial authorities and the IACHR stating that
since 1988, when Chumel left the PAC's, PAC members threatened and intimidated
Chumel to the extent that he was forced to leave his community for fear of his
life.  There are other credible reports that others who refused to serve in the
PAC's suffered threats and other abuses.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUINEA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and judicial search
warrants are required by law.  Police frequently ignore these procedures,
however, or do not strictly follow them, and interference in citizens' lives
continued, primarily through police harassment.  Police and paramilitary police
often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals and frequently detain
private citizens at night roadblocks in order to extort money to supplement
their incomes.  It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and
telephone calls.<p>
<p>
Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain of
intimidation and harassment by public officials and authorities.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUINEA-BISSAU</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and
correspondence, but the Government does not always respect these rights.  The
authorities examine international and domestic mail, the security forces seldom
use judicial warrants, and the police sometimes force entry into private
homes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUYANA</b><p>
<p>
The Government generally respects the right to privacy, although some
opposition politicians have claimed instances of government surveillance of
political meetings and rallies.  (Uniformed police officers are routinely
present at such rallies.)  Police generally respected the laws requiring
judicially issued search warrants.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HAITI</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides that no house search or seizure of papers may take
place except in accordance with the law.  Correspondence is also defined as
inviolable.<p>
<p>
Prior to September 19, soldiers and other armed persons frequently entered
private homes for illegal purposes in Port-au-Prince and the provinces.  In
August there was a rash of attacks on the homes of politicians, including
parliamentarians and the mayor of Petionville, the capital's main suburb.
Attaches and FRAPH members were involved in raids on homes, but victims also
reported seeing soldiers personally known to them and dressed in civilian
clothing among their attackers.  In addition, gangsters violently raided entire
neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, taking advantage of their ties to police and
the general climate of impunity to steal and rape.  When the armed persons
entered looking for a particular individual, they frequently beat or otherwise
harmed family members during the search.<p>
<p>
The police, along with armed civilians acting at their behest, frequently used
roadblocks to conduct illegal searches, especially during periods of real or
perceived political tension.  The discovery of pro-Aristide posters or
literature during a police search of a house or vehicle frequently resulted in
physical abuse and illegal arrest.  There were credible reports that police and
military also seized private correspondence during such searches.<p>
<p>
After the arrival of the MNF and the restoration of the legitimate Government,
such abuses were dramatically reduced.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HONDURAS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that persons
authorized by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the
authorization of a competent authority.  Entry may take place only between 6
a.m. and 6 p.m. or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the
commission of a crime.  However, as in previous years, there were credible
charges that police and armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain the
needed authorization before entering a private home.  Despite a new system of
"duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to issue search orders, they appeared to
lack the discipline to make themselves available 24 hours per day, 7 days a
week.  Coordination among the police, the court, and the Public Ministry is
improving.  However, interagency liaison problems still undermine the
effectiveness of the system.<p>
<p>
Judges may authorize government monitoring of mail or telephones for specific
purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security.  However, the
armed forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national
telephone company to monitor illegally telephone lines of influential people in
the Government, the military, and the private sector without authorization from
the appropriate civilian judicial authority.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HONG KONG</b><p>
<p>
The law provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally
respects this right.  The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is
vested with powers which are normally exercised only by a judicial officer.
Amendments to ordinances governing the ICAC deprived it of this independent
authority to issue arrest or search warrants (it must now go to the courts),
but it still operates on the assumption that any excessive, unexplainable
assets held by civil servants are considered ill-gotten until proven
otherwise.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HUNGARY</b><p>
<p>
The law provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrants
independently.  Police must carry out house searches in the presence of two
witnesses and must prepare a written inventory of items removed from the
premises.  Wiretapping, which may be done for national security reasons and for
legitimate criminal investigations, requires a court's permission.  These
provisions are observed in practice.<p>
<p>
A search warrant is not necessary, however, in cases in which the police are
making checks on the validity of the identity papers of foreigners.  In a
series of raids in September, police conducted arbitrary identity checks in
restaurants and residences frequented by foreigners.  In Budapest, a dozen
policemen went to the residence of an American business executive at 2:45 a.m.
to demand identification.  The businessman was not home.  The policemen left
after the businessman's wife produced the appropriate documents for herself and
her small children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ICELAND</b><p>
<p>
Under the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect for the autonomy
and rights of individuals.  A warrant from a court is required to enter a
private house, except in cases of hot pursuit.  There have been no known
arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political organizations, or any
other organized group into the private beliefs or personal liberties of
individuals.<p>
<p>
<b>INDIA</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The police must obtain warrants for searches and seizures.  In a criminal
investigation, the police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue
delay, but they must justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate
with jurisdiction over the offense.  The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir,
Punjab, and Assam have special powers to search and arrest without a warrant.<p>
<p>
The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications,
including monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail--in
cases of public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or
tranquility."  These powers have been used by every state government.<p>
<p>
On May 25, the Punjab state government ordered the authorities to intercept any
mail addressed to or mailed by various Sikh political, student, and lawyer
groups, persons residing in Pakistan, or any group or person considered a
danger to the state.  On July 25, the state High Court ordered the state
government to suspend implementing the order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>INDONESIA</b><p>
<p>
Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases involving
suspected subversion, economic crimes, and corruption.  However, security
agencies regularly make forced or surreptitious entries.  They also intimidate
by surveillance of persons and residences and selective monitoring of local and
international telephone calls without legal restraint.  Government security
officials monitor the movements and activities of former members of the PKI and
its front organizations, especially persons the Government believes were
involved in the abortive 1965 Communist-backed coup.  The Government stated in
late 1990 that this latter group then totaled 1,410,333 people.  These persons
and their relatives sometimes are subject to surveillance, required check-ins,
periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel outside their city of
residence.  Their legally required identification cards carry the initials
"E.T." which stand for "Ex-Tapol," or former political prisoner, which readily
identifies them to prospective employers or government officials.<p>

The Government's transmigration program which moved large numbers of people
from overpopulated islands to more isolated and backward ones has been
criticized by nongovernmental human rights monitors.  They say that it not only
violates the rights of indigenous people but also those of the transmigrants,
claiming that they are frequently duped into leaving their home villages
without any means of return (see Section 5.).<p>

<b>IRAN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)"
are protected from trespass except as "provided by law."  However, security
forces enter homes and offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mail
without court authorization.  The wife of writer Saidi-Sirjani reported that,
after her husband's arrest in March, the Anti-Vice Department of the
Revolutionary Prosecutor's office raided her home, seized her husband's papers,
and sealed the library (see Section 1.a.).<p>
<p>
Paramilitary volunteer forces known as the Basiji and other security forces
monitor the social activities of citizens.  Such organizations may harass or
arrest women whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body except
hands and face, or those who wear makeup.  Enforcement of such standards of
public morality varies with the political climate and the jurisdiction.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IRAQ</b><p>
<p>
The Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy,
particularly in cases in which national security is alleged to be involved.
The law defines security offenses so broadly that authorities are virtually
exempt from the legal requirement to obtain search warrants.  In 1994 the
authorities subjected the Shi'a religious clergy, Shi'a Muslim inhabitants of
the southern marshes, and various ethnic minorities to searches without
warrants (see Section 1.g.).  The regime routinely ignores the constitutional
provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of mail and telegraphic
correspondence and telephone conversations.<p>
<p>
The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of
informers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public.  As the
Special Rapporteur noted in his February report, "the fear of informers and
subsequent severe reprisals have prevented virtually the entire population from
expressing genuinely held opinions which are not consistent with those of the
Government."<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IRELAND</b><p>
<p>
The Supreme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in
the Constitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must
be respected in law and practice; and the Government honors this.<p>
<p>
However, the Constitution provides that the State shall enact no law permitting
divorce.  A 1986 nationwide referendum overwhelmingly defeated a proposal to
amend the Constitution to permit divorce in limited circumstances.  In the same
year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the prohibition of divorce
is not a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ireland is
a party.  The Government has pledged to hold another referendum on divorce,
which now seems likely to occur in 1995.<p>

<b>ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Although privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law,
authorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations.
In criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping by court order; in security
cases, the order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense.  Under emergency
regulations, authorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ITALY</b><p>
<p>
The law safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect this
provision.  Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under
judicial warrant and in carefully defined circumstances.  There have been no
reports of any other kinds of violations of privacy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JAMAICA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private
life of the individual.  The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act, however,
continues to give security personnel the sort of broad powers of search and
seizure which were consistently abused under the Suppression of Crimes Act.
Although the use of telephone taps without a court order is officially limited
to cases involving the drug trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government,
politicians, trade union officials, and local journalists have charged that the
authorities were tapping their telephones in recent years.  The accused
authorities did not respond to these charges.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JAPAN</b><p>
<p>
Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate
warrant issued by a judge.  Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard
against arbitrary searches.  There were no reports that the Government or any
other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or
correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JORDAN</b><p>
<p>
The police must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge before
conducting searches in most cases.  However, in security cases, authorities
sometimes, and in violation of the law, obtain warrants retroactively or obtain
preapproved warrants.  Security officers reportedly monitor telephones, read
correspondence, and engage in surveillance of persons that allegedly pose a
threat to the regime.  While these practices are not believed to be widespread,
the law permits them if the Government obtains a court order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>KAZAKHSTAN</b><p>
<p>
The KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the
Procuracy, may arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and
correspondence, a legacy of Soviet rule.  The law requires criminal police, who
remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain a search warrant from
a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search without a
warrant.  There were credible reports in 1994 that police occasionally planted
evidence.<p>
<p>
The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law it
must inform the Procuracy within 3 days of such activity.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>KENYA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "to
promote the public benefit," such as in security cases.  Although security
officials generally obtain judicially issued search warrants, at times they
conduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize
property believed to be stolen.  The courts have admitted evidence obtained
without search warrants to support convictions.<p>
<p>
Security forces employ various means of surveillance, including electronic
surveillance and a network of informers.  Police routinely monitored the
activities of political opponents and their associates.  In a June letter to
the Director of State Intelligence, FORD-K M.P. Paul Muite complained that
several specific vehicles with civilian license plates constantly shadowed his
movements and that of his family.  Muite, who is also the lead defense attorney
in the Wamwere case, reported that the cars even followed him from Nairobi to
the Nakuru courtroom and back again--a 4-hour trip.<p>
<p>
The Government monitored and intercepted correspondence as well.  In August the
U.S.-based Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights mailed two
packages to the Kenya Human Rights Commission.  The local Nairobi post office
refused to release the packages, claiming that the reports were "political" and
"hitting at the Government."  In April police detained and interrogated an
18-year-old student for several hours after police intercepted a letter she had
sent to opposition M.P. Paul Muite.<p>
<p>
City council security officers, or "Askaris," continued to destroy the kiosks
of licensed and unlicensed vendors in several Kenyan cities.  On February 9 and
15, Nairobi Askaris demolished and burned a stretch of vendors' booths at the
Machakos country bus terminal, destroying several thousand dollars' worth of
property.  On February 16, Askaris beat and arrested the chairman of the
Vendors' Association when he visited the Machakos bus terminal.  Askaris also
arrested and confiscated goods from vendors at the Kisumu town center in
February.<p>
<p>
Although Kenyans are theoretically free to choose their political affiliation,
government employees continued to be warned to support the ruling party or be
fired.  In May the Government dismissed a permanent secretary in the Ministry
of Labor after he reportedly made contact with an opposition party member.<p>

<p>
<b>REPUBLIC OF KOREA</b><p>
<p>
In general, the Government honors the integrity of the home and family.  In the
past, the security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance,
including wiretaps, of political dissidents.  The Antiwiretap Law and the law
to reform the NSP were designed to curb government surveillance of civilians,
and appear largely to have succeeded.  The Antiwiretap Law lays out broad
conditions under which the monitoring of telephone calls, mail, and other forms
of communication are legal  It requires government officials to secure a
judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the event of an emergency,
soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms for those who violate
this law.  Some human rights groups argue that a considerable amount of illegal
wiretapping is still taking place and say the lack of an independent body to
investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps hinders the
effectiveness of the antiwiretapping law.<p>
<p>
South Koreans are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes or
read books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are
doing so for the purpose of helping North Korea.  Student groups make plausible
claims that government informants are posted around university campuses.
Persons with backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult
to obtain some forms of employment or advance in such fields as government,
broadcast media, and education.<p>

<p>
<b>KUWAIT</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home.  The
police must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unless
they are in hot pursuit or suspect the presence of alcohol or narcotics.  The
warrant can be obtained from the state prosecutor or, in the case of private
property, from a judge.  The security forces occasionally monitor the
activities of individuals and their communications.<p>
<p>
By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.
However, the Government does not vigorously enforce the restriction, and
Kuwaitis routinely obtain exemptions from the Ministry of Justice.  The
Government also advises women against marrying foreign nationals.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>KYRGYZ REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The 1993 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes
of the occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy of
correspondence, and telephonic and telegraphic communications are protected by
law.  Current law and procedures require the General Procurators's approval for
wiretaps, searches of homes, interception of mail, and similar procedures.<p>
<p>
Personnel and organizations responsible for violations during the Soviet period
have remained largely in place; however, no widespread and systematic
violations of the privacy of citizens were reported in 1994, but the local
press often cited harassment of individuals by police on the street as a
problem.  Some citizens active in politics or interested in human rights
believe that the privacy of their communications was violated in 1994.
Credible evidence is not available.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LAOS</b><p>
<p>
Concomitant with economic liberalization, the Government relaxed some elements
of state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and
business activities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew.  However, while
the Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without possessing a
warrant or authorization, the security bureaus authorize search and seizure by
themselves rather than by judicial authority.  The Government and the party
continue to monitor the citizenry sporadically through a system of neighborhood
and workplace committees.  The neighborhood committees also have responsibility
for maintaining public order and reporting "bad elements" to the police.  These
committees usually concern themselves more with street crime and instances of
moral turpitude than with political activism.  The degree of surveillance and
control varies from province to province.<p>
<p>
The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but
the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves.
Monitoring of international mail and telephone calls continued, although the
increasing number of such calls limited its extent.<p>
<p>
The 1991 Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land.
Private "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates, which can be
bought, sold, and transferred to heirs.  Many Lao who fled the country after
1975 regained confiscated property after demonstrating their intent to
repatriate.<p>

<p>
<p>
<b>LEBANON</b><p>
<p>
While the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the
personal lives of citizens, they are not reluctant to interfere with the
privacy of persons regarded as foes of the Government.  Laws require that
prosecutors must obtain warrants before entering houses, except when the army
is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker.  Militias and non-Lebanese forces
operating outside areas of central government authority have frequently
violated rights of privacy.  Various factions and the Government use informer
networks and monitor telephones to gather information on their foes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LESOTHO</b><p>
<p>
Although search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the
ISA provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles
and to enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant.
After the May LMP mutiny, police officers entered without warrant dozens of
residences in the Maseru neighborhoods of Sea Point and Matimposo, allegedly
seeking looted property.  The security services are believed to monitor
routinely telephone conversations of Basotho and foreigners on national
security grounds.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LIBERIA</b><p>
<p>
While the Constitution provides for these rights, there were many serious
abuses of privacy and home--including confiscation of property and failure to
obtain required warrants--by the police and fighters of all the warring
factions.  According to the Constitution, the police must have a warrant or a
reasonable belief that a crime is in progress, or is about to be committed,
before entering a private dwelling.  In practice, the police engaged in forced
entry without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations.<p>
<p>
Combatants of all the warring factions looted villages during the year, with
ULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo factions in Bomi and Cape Mount counties and LPC
and NPFL fighters in southeastern counties and elsewhere drawing considerable
public outrage.  These forces pilfered virtually any item of value and
regularly demanded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverished
residents or displaced persons, often robbing them of their clothes and
physically abusing them, particularly at checkpoints.  Confiscation of private
homes and vehicles was common practice.<p>
<p>
These factions also used forced entry for purposes of intimidation.  For
example, AFL soldiers made two raids on the Monrovia residence of a legislative
representative to harass the representative for his support of the new police
director.  In one instance, an AFL soldier shot the representative's guard in
the leg.  The representative sent a formal letter to the Transitional
Legislative Assembly accusing four members of the AFL high command of attempted
murder.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LIBYA</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not respect the right to privacy.  Security agencies often
disregard the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private
home.  They also routinely monitor telephone calls.<p>
<p>
The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive
informant network.  Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected
regime opponents may result in government harassment and detention.  The
Government may seize and destroy property belonging to the "enemies of the
people" or those who "cooperate" with foreign powers.  In early 1994, citizens
reported that Mr. Qadhafi warned that members of the extended family of any
regime opponent risk the death penalty.<p>
<p>
In August Mr. Qadhafi proposed a program to seize private wealth, deeming all
private assets above a nominal amount to be the fruits of exploitation or
corruption.  He encouraged local cadres to investigate and report any citizen
retaining "excessive" private assets after the expiration of a grace period,
during which citizens could turn over such assets to the Government.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LIECHTENSTEIN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for personal liberty, and for inviolability of the
home, of postal correspondence, and of telephone conversations.  No violations
have been reported.  Police need a judicial warrant to search private
property.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LITHUANIA</b><p>
<p>
The authorities do not engage in indiscriminate or widespread monitoring of the
correspondence or communications of citizens.  With the written authorization
of a procurator or judge, however, police and the security service may engage
in surveillance and monitoring activities on grounds of national security.
Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of disappearance of evidence,
police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor before they may
enter premises.<p>
<p>
It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the
use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized
crime.  There is some question as to the legal basis of this police
surveillance, but there are no known legal cases challenging the legality of
the surveillance.  The former president of the Lithuanian National Bank, who
charged that eavesdropping devices were found in his office in 1993, publicly
called on the Procurator General to investigate the incident.  The press
reported that, although the devices were in fact found and are in the
possession of the new bank management, the authorities failed to pursue
investigation of the incident.<p>

<b>MADAGASCAR</b><p>

The home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervene

<p>
<b>MALAYSIA</b><p>
<p>
These rights are normally respected and protected by law.  Provisions in the
security legislation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and
search without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national
security.  Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts.  In some cases
each year, police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices,
seize books and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody
without a warrant.<p>

It also forbids searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime.<p>

Opponents of the Government continue to claim that security forces monitored
and harassed them, especially during the election campaign.  It is widely
believed that the security forces continued to use electronic monitoring of
residences and telephones in some cases, although confirmation of such
activities is lacking.  By law, the prosecutor's office must authorize wiretaps
and may do so only if a criminal investigation is under way.  In practice, the

The 1990 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and expressly prohibits
the use of surveillance techniques.  By law, police need a warrant to enter
homes and businesses, but in practice most policemen routinely operate without
them.  During the war, police and security forces entered homes at will, used a
variety of surveillance techniques, and often forced civilians to move into
government-protected villages.  However, since the signing of the Rome Accords,
the number of reported incidents of intrusive government actions declined
markedly.<p>
<p>
Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal
telephone wiretapping by Government intelligence agencies allegedly still

The Constitution generally provides protection from these abuses.  Searches not

rights are traced through the female line.  Until very recently, laws
restricted intermarriage of Nauru men and women with non-Nauruans.  Although
the laws have changed and such intermarriage is practiced and permitted,
intermarriage between Nauru women and foreign males still draws substantial
social censure.  The spouses--male or female--of Nauru citizens have no
automatic right of abode in Nauru.  They are, however, normally granted
short-term "visits" sponsored by the Nauru spouse or they may apply for
longer-term work permits.  Foreign spouses are not eligible for Nauru

of Leon looking for the driver of an illegally parked truck.  The driver and
two workmen were delivering material to a nearby chapel and had sought refuge
in the Bishop's residence after being chased by the police.  The police entered
the residence without a warrant, caught the workmen, and beat them in front of
the Bishop.  The police later released the three uncharged persons, and Vice
Minister of Government Frank Cesar personally visited and apologized to the
Bishop (the police also apologized).  The Bishop made no formal complaint.<p>

<p>
<b>DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The constitutional stipulation that "citizens are guaranteed the inviolability
of person and residence and the privacy of correspondence" does not reflect
reality.  The Government relies upon an extensive system of informers to
identify critics and potential troublemakers.  In some cases, entire families
are detained for alleged political offenses committed by one member of the
family.<p>
<p>
The authorities subject citizens in all age groups and occupations to political
and ideological indoctrination.  Even after Kim Il Sung's death, his cult of
personality and glorification of his family and the official "juche"
(self-reliance) ideology continued to be omnipresent.  The cult approaches the
level of a state religion.  The goal of indoctrination remains to ensure
loyalty to the Kim Il Sung system and his son and heir Kim Jong Il, as well as
conformity to the State's ideology and authority.  Indoctrination is carried
out systematically not only through the mass media, but also in schools and
through worker and neighborhood associations.  Citizens with relatives who fled
to South Korea at the time of the Korean War appear to be still classified as
part of the "hostile class" in the DPRK's elaborate loyalty system.  Because
approximately 10 million families were separated by the war, this category
encompasses a significant percentage of the North Korean population.<p>
<p>
The defector Cho Kap Chae estimated that the class of those considered
politically "impure" may comprise 25 to 30 percent of the population.  Members
of this class may still be subject to some discrimination, although Cho claimed
that their treatment has improved greatly in recent years.<p>

<p>
<b>NORWAY</b><p>
<p>
The privacy of the family and the person is free from arbitrary interference by
the Government.  Police may conduct searches of the home only with court
approval and in instances of hot pursuit or when they fear evidence is being
destroyed.  There were no allegations of forced entry into homes in 1994.  In
most cases, wiretaps are prohibited by law, but they may be used in cases
involving state security or narcotics offenses when officially approved by the
court within carefully drawn legal guidelines.  Correspondence may be opened
only by court order in cases involving state security.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (INCLUDING AREAS SUBJECT TO JURISDICTION OF THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY)</b><p>
<p>
Israeli military authorities in the West Bank may enter private Palestinian
homes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when authorized by
an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel.  In conducting searches, the IDF
has used forced entries, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed
property.  Undercover units have also engaged in destructive and violent
behavior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wanted
Palestinians.  Israeli authorities claim that forced entry may lawfully occur
only when incident to an arrest and when entry is resisted.  They maintain that
beatings and arbitrary destruction of property during searches are punishable
violations of military regulations, and that compensation is due to victims in
such cases.  The Government does not provide information regarding such
compensation.<p>
<p>
Authorities sealed 5 houses in 1994 for security reasons, a sharp decline from
27 houses sealed in 1993.  Security forces may demolish or seal the home of a
suspect, whether he is the owner or tenant, without any trial.  The decision to
seal or demolish a house is made by several high-level Israeli officials,
including the coordinator of the Civil Administration and the Defense Minister.
Owners of houses ordered demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the area
commander; a final appeal may be made to the High Court.  A successful appeal
generally results in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing.  After a
house is demolished, military authorities confiscate the land and prohibit the
owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble.<p>
<p>
In November part of a house was demolished by military order for security
reasons after an appeal to the Israeli High Court was rejected.  This was the
first house demolition, albeit partial, since 1992.  The home was the residence
of the Palestinian responsible for the October bus bombing in Tel Aviv and
belonged to his parents.  Many human rights groups maintain that the sealing or
demolishing of homes is a form of collective punishment because such acts
target families and children.<p>
<p>
Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or
unseal their homes.  In 1994 the Government processed 94 requests to open
sealed rooms and houses; 61 applications were approved.  In June the
Palestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence began a campaign to reopen many
homes sealed during the occupation.  At the Center's urging, activists and
family members opened 130 of more than 350 sealed houses before they were
arrested.  Authorities resealed several of the homes.  In December the Israeli
Government decided to allow the opening or rebuilding of homes sealed or
demolished as a result of security offenses committed by a family member who
had been released from prison.  Each former prisoner must apply for a
rebuilding or unsealing permit after which the Government will approve or
reject the application.<p>
<p>
Israeli security services sometimes monitor mail and telephone conversations.
The authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service and electricity to
specific areas.<p>
<p>
In Gaza and Jericho, the existing law requires that a chief prosecutor issue
warrants for entry and searches of private property.  These requirements were
ignored in October, when the Palestinian police conducted a sweep of several
districts in the Gaza Strip to search for a kidnaped Israeli soldier.  Homes
were searched without the consent of their owners; in some cases, the police
forcibly entered premises, destroying doors and windows.  Palestinian human
rights groups and political leaders protested the police's conduct, but the PA
did not officially respond.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>OMAN</b><p>
<p>
The police are not required by law to obtain search warrants.  There is a
widespread belief that the Government eavesdrops on both oral and written
communications, and Omanis are guarded in both areas.  Citizens must obtain
permission from the Ministry of Interior to marry foreigners.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PAKISTAN</b><p>
<p>
By law the police must obtain a warrant to search a house but do not need a
warrant to search a person.  However, the police often enter homes without a
warrant.  In the absence of a warrant, a policeman is subject to charges of
criminal trespass.  However, policemen are seldom punished for illegal entry.<p>
<p>
The Government maintains several domestic intelligence services which monitor
politicians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreign
intelligence agents.  Credible reports indicate that the authorities commonly
resort to wiretapping and occasionally intercept and open mail.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PANAMA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and communications.
The authorities may not examine personal documents, monitor communications, or
enter and search private residences except by written order.  However, there
were credible complaints that PTJ agents failed to follow legal requirements
for arrest and search warrants and instead conducted indiscriminate searches of
entire apartment buildings or housing complexes.  Such complaints continued
during the first months of the Perez Balladares Government.<p>
<p>
Despite the view of some that the Constitution prohibits all wiretapping, the
Government maintains that wiretapping with judicial branch approval is legal.
Under the guidelines established by new antinarcotics legislation passed in
July, the Public Ministry may engage in undercover operations, including the
use of "videotaping and recording of conversations."  The Supreme Court will
ultimately have to decide whether wiretapping is constitutional and, if so,
under what circumstances.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PAPUA NEW GUINEA</b><p>
<p>
While the authorities generally respect privacy rights, police in the highlands
and the PNGDF in Bougainville have burned homes to quell intertribal conflict
and punish communities suspected of harboring suspected criminals.  Also,
police often force entry into homes during searches for criminals or stolen
goods.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PARAGUAY</b><p>
<p>
While the Government and its security forces generally did not interfere in the
private lives of citizens, there were exceptions.  The Constitution provides
that police may not enter private homes except to prevent a crime in progress
or when the police possess a judicial warrant.  There were credible reports
that at times the authorities ignored this legal guarantee, particularly in the
country's interior.  There were also allegations that the Government
occasionally spied on individuals and monitored communications for political
and security reasons.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PERU</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution requires security forces to have a judicial warrant to enter a
private dwelling, but this requirement is suspended in the emergency zones, and
security forces in those areas routinely conduct searches of private homes
without warrants.  The law requires that a Public Ministry prosecutor be
present during searches.  There were plausible reports that, on occasion,
police planted subversive pamphlets in the homes of persons they suspected of
terrorism but could not otherwise arrest for lack of evidence.  There were
frequent credible reports of illegal telephone wiretaps.  In August and
September, several prominent journalists, opposition politicians, and retired
military officers made credible claims that the Government's intelligence
services followed them, videotaped them, and recorded their private
conversations.<p>
<p>
In Lima and other urban areas, the army conducted "sweep" operations in which
soldiers surrounded and sealed off targeted neighborhoods to conduct
house-to-house searches.  They detained persons wanted for a crime and held for
questioning those found with unregistered weapons, subversive material, or
without identity documents.  Public prosecutors routinely accompany these
operations, and citizens made few complaints of serious abuses stemming from
them.<p>
<p>
A number of rural communities--with arms, training, and encouragement from the
army--have organized self-defense forces, or rondas, to protect themselves
against terrorist and bandit incursions.  These have had a noticeable impact on
curbing Sendero's presence in certain areas of the country.  In some parts of
Peru, rondas have existed for centuries as a form of social organization and to
protect communities from invaders and rustlers.  However, military authorities
organized many of the newer rondas and sometimes coerced peasants into
participating.  As a regular practice and to a far greater degree, Sendero also
forced peasants to join its military ranks, often for extended periods,
coercing their participation in terrorist attacks and executions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE PHILIPPINES</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides that search warrants may be issued by a judge on a
finding of probable cause.  Restrictions on search and seizure are generally
observed, although raids without search warrants on private homes are
occasionally reported.  In the past, judges have thrown out evidence obtained
illegally.<p>
<p>
The Government does not interfere with the free personal use of the mails or
other public communications except upon issuance of a court order in the course
of an investigation.<p>
<p>
Some human rights NGO's are increasingly concerned about the Government's
forced resettlement of tenant farmers to make way for development projects.
These resettlement schemes are designed to clear the land for industrial,
agroindustrial, and tourism projects.  In urban settings, squatters are moved
to make way for infrastructure, commercial, and housing projects.  The
Government has made efforts to resettle squatters, as required by law, but
NGO's contend that in both rural and urban settings, those being relocated are
sometimes given little or no notice and are violently ejected.  Land rights
issues are made more difficult by the slow process of the Government's exercise
of eminent domain and complex zoning regulations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>POLAND</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not arbitrarily monitor private mail or telephones.  There
is no Polish legislation that guarantees the right to privacy, although Poland
has signed the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides for that
right.  Poles do have the legal right to privacy of correspondence, and there
was no evidence of violations.<p>
<p>
The Government introduced draft legislation in Parliament in September which
would give the police the power--with the personal approval of the chief
prosecutor and the Interior Minister--to monitor private mail and telephone
conversations in cases involving serious crimes, drugs, money laundering, or
illegal arms sales.  The parliamentary opposition sought assurances that these
expanded police powers would be subject to appropriate human rights safeguards
but generally supported the need to expand the police force's ability to combat
crime.<p>
<p>
Polish law forbids arbitrary forced entry into homes.  Search warrants issued
by a prosecutor are required in order to enter private residences.  In
emergency cases when a prosecutor is not immediately available, police may
enter a residence with the approval of the local police commander.  In the most
urgent cases, in which there is not time to consult with the police commander,
police may enter a private residence after showing their official
identification.  There were no reports that Polish police abused search warrant
procedures in 1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PORTUGAL</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution forbids forced entry into homes and searches without a
judicial warrant.  In addition, entry into a person's home at night requires
the consent of the occupant.  The Government may intercept private
correspondence, or make wiretaps, only on the basis of a court order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>QATAR</b><p>
<p>
Traditional attitudes of respect for the sanctity of the home provide a great
deal of protection against arbitrary intrusions for most citizens and residents
of Qatar.  A warrant must normally be obtained before police may search a
residence or business, except in cases involving national security or
emergencies.  However, warrants are issued by police officials themselves
rather than by judicial authorities.  There were no reports of unauthorized
searches of homes in 1994.  The police and security forces are believed to
monitor the communications of suspected criminals, those considered to be
security risks, and selected foreigners.<p>
<p>
With prior permission, which is usually granted, Qataris may marry foreigners
of any nationality and apply for residence permits for their spouses.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ROMANIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for legal protection against the search of a
residence without a warrant, but this protection is subordinate to "national
security or public order."  The 1992 National Security Law defines national
security very broadly and lists as threats to national security not only crimes
such as terrorism, treason, espionage, assassination, and armed insurrection
but also totalitarian, racist, and anti-Semitic actions or attempts to change
the existing national borders. Security officials may enter residences without
proper authorization from a prosecutor if they deem a threat to national
security "imminent."<p>
<p>
The Constitution further states that the privacy of legal means of
communication is inviolable; thus, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) is
legally prohibited from engaging in political acts (e.g., monitoring the
communications of a political party). However, the laws on national security
allow it to engage in such monitoring on national security grounds.  Similarly,
although the law requires the SRI to obtain a warrant from a prosecutor to
carry out intelligence activities involving "threats to national security," it
may engage in a wide variety of operations, including "technical operations,"
in order to determine if a situation meets the legal definition of a "threat to
national security."<p>
<p>
In 1994 arbitrary interference with individual citizens' rights to privacy was
infrequent; however, some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and Protestant
church groups alleged that current or former government intelligence services
opened their mail and tapped their telephones.  The tenor of official responses
to such complaints was always that the SRI itself was not involved, but that
unreconstructed agents of the Securitate, the Communist-era internal
intelligence service, or independent individuals were involved.  In addition,
both Romanian citizens and foreign diplomats credibly reported opened mail,
personal surveillance, and harassment.<p>
<p>
The Government took some measures to investigate reports of such continuing
abuses.  In September the prosecutor's office brought to trial the former head
of the SRI in Maramures county, accused of illegally tapping wires for the PUNR
in the 1992 local elections.  The SRI had dismissed the accused immediately
following the alleged incident, but his trial attracted increased public
attention after the appointment of the new Minister of Telecommunications, who
is a member of the PUNR and was head of the telecommunications service in
Maramures at the time of the alleged infraction.  However, the court dismissed
the case in October on procedural grounds before trying it.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>RUSSIA</b><p>
<p>
Article 25 of the Constitution states that the right to privacy in the home may
be violated only on the basis of a court decision or in accordance with federal
laws.  In practice, law enforcement organs and internal security forces fail to
do this and continue to observe the Soviet-era requirement of informing the
prosecutor's office of intent to enter private premises.<p>
<p>
Article 23 of the Constitution provides for privacy of correspondence and
electronic communications, except in cases in which a judge issues a warrant.
Many Russians believe electronic monitoring of residences and telephone
conversations continues, even if at reduced levels in comparison to the Soviet
era.<p>
<p>
Refugee organizations claim that law enforcement officials routinely use
informer networks to track the whereabouts of persons from the Caucasus,
whether resident in Russia legally or illegally.  General societal
discrimination against people from the Caucasus area and reports of harassment
against these people by law enforcement officials lend credence to such
assertions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>RWANDA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the respect of privacy of individuals,
correspondence, and communications and declares that the home is inviolable.
Police generally respected these provisions before the events of April.  In the
3-month period that followed, political and military officials of the interim
government abandoned any pretense of respecting privacy laws and committed
wholesale abuses.<p>
<p>
There are no reports that the new Government interfered with these rights, nor
does it reportedly engage in surveillance of political parties, associations,
or individuals.  However, Hutu civilians and displaced persons in the northwest
and southwest complained of abuses by RPA troops searching for weapons and
suspected war criminals.  After capturing Kigali, both RPA soldiers and
civilians committed widespread looting and vandalism.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SAN MARINO</b><p>
<p>
The authorities respect the concept of privacy of the home.  The law requires
judicial warrants for searches, and provides also for protection of the privacy
of correspondence, including telephonic communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the integrity of the person and the right to
privacy of home, correspondence, and private communication.  The Government
does not engage in intrusive practices, such as surveillance of individuals or
communications.  The Judicial Police are responsible for criminal
investigations and must obtain authorization from the Ministry of Justice to
conduct searches.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SENEGAL</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, and there was little
government interference in the private lives of citizens, particularly in the
rural areas.  Normally, search warrants are required and only judges may issue
them.  In practice, however, searches without warrants occasionally take
place.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SERBIA-MONTENEGRO</b><p>
<p>
Federal law gives republic ministries of the interior sole control over the
decision to monitor potential criminal activities, a power routinely abused.
Authorities regularly monitored opposition and dissident activity, eavesdropped
on conversations, read mail, and tapped telephones.  In December human rights
advocates objected to an announcement by the Federal post office that it had
been registering all mail from abroad, ostensibly to protect mail carriers from
charges of theft.<p>
<p>
Although the law includes restrictions on searches, officials often ignored
such restrictions.  In Kosovo and Sandzak, police systematically subjected
ethnic Albanians to random searches of their homes, vehicles, and offices,
asserting they were searching for weapons.  The CDHRF reported that in the
first 3 months of 1994 police searched over 1,000 Kosovar Albanian homes, often
physically abusing the inhabitants.<p>
<p>
As an example of such methods, on a typical day in Kosovo (July 22), police
raided Hetmen and Nezir Makolli's Pristina home and seized a licensed hunting
rifle, searched the home of Hysen Hasani and his sons in Lipljan, and raided
the home of Hasan Fetaj in Suva Reka, threatening to draft him into the
Yugoslav army.  Similar scenes were repeated thousands of times in Kosovo and
Sandzak.<p>
<p>
In January and February, police conducted a series of massive house-to-house
searches in Prijepolje (Sandzak).  Police also routinely stopped private
vehicles in Kosovo and Sandzak and searched them and the passengers without
probable cause.  Authorities often confiscated foreign currency from drivers
and passengers, although it is not illegal to possess foreign currency.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SEYCHELLES</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and freedom from arbitrary
searches.  The law requires a warrant for police searches, and the authorities
generally respected this requirement in practice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SIERRA LEONE</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, the
authorities still have broad authority under NPRC decrees to monitor actions or
conversations within homes, to prevent a person from acting in a manner
prejudicial to public safety, to impose restrictions on employment or business,
to control association or communication with other persons, and to interfere
with correspondence.<p>
<p>
In practice, there were numerous occasions of abusive treatment of ordinary
citizens by ill-disciplined soldiers and police, both within and outside of the
war zone.  These abuses included forced entry into homes, robberies, and
assaults, some of them fatal.  Superior officers frequently punished offending
soldiers when caught.  In November the government executed 12 soldiers who had
been found guilty by a court-martial for crimes ranging from armed robbery to
murder (see Section l.e.).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SINGAPORE</b><p>
<p>
The Government can use its wide discretionary powers if it determines that
national security is threatened.  In most cases, the law requires search
warrants, normally issued by the magistrate court, for intrusion into the home.
Law enforcement officers may, however, search a person, home, or property
without a warrant if they decide searches are necessary to preserve evidence.<p>
<p>
The Misuse of Drugs Act and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act also
permit warrantless searches in dealing with drug- and secret society-related
offenses.  The courts may undertake judicial review of such searches at the
request of the defendant.  Divisions of the Government's law enforcement
agencies, including the ISD and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board
(CPIB), have wide networks for gathering information.  The authorities have the
capability to monitor telephone and other private conversations and conduct
surveillance, but there were no proven allegations that they did so in 1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SLOVAK REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The Criminal Code requires police to obtain a judicial search warrant in order
to enter a home.  The court may issue such a warrant only if there is a
well-founded suspicion that important evidence or persons accused of criminal
activity are present inside or if there is some other important reason.  Police
must present the warrant before conducting the house search or within 24 hours
after the search.<p>
<p>
The 1993 police law regulates wiretapping and mail surveillance for the
purposes of criminal investigation, which may be conducted, on the order of a
judge or prosecutor, only in cases of extraordinarily serious premeditated
crimes or crimes involving international treaty obligations.  There were no
reports of illegal surveillance of persons or communications or of mail
tampering.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SLOVENIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides protection for privacy and the inviolability of the
home, mail, and other means of communication.  These rights and protections are
usually respected in practice.  However, in March parts of a university
professor's private correspondence, critical of a minister in the Government,
were read out in a broadcast on a government-controlled television station.
The issue is now in the courts.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOLOMON ISLANDS</b><p>
<p>
In addition to legal provisions, the traditional culture provides strong
protection against these types of abuses.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOMALIA</b><p>
<p>
These rights were regularly violated by the warring factions.  During fighting
in Mogadishu, heavily armed bandits systematically looted the property of rival
groups.  Similar incidents occurred after the fighting in Kismayo in February.
During military operations, the major factions have conducted home searches and
evictions, and homes and property belonging to the former government and
international bodies have been looted and destroyed.  Although there has been
some discussion about property claims, the continued fighting has rendered the
issue moot.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOUTH AFRICA</b><p>
<p>
Police and security forces retained the legal authority to engage in domestic
surveillance activities, including the use of informers.  However, informed
observers believe that under the country's dramatically changed political
environment the use of this authority has been limited to the pursuit of
legitimate law enforcement and national security objectives.<p>
<p>
Before the Interim Constitution came into force, police had sweeping powers of
search and seizure in magisterial districts that had been declared "unrest
areas," under the provisions of the Public Safety Act.  The provisions of the
Act that allowed for the declaration of "unrest areas" are no longer operative,
and police searches in all of South Africa must now be conducted in accordance
with the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977.  This Act requires that a warrant be
issued by a magistrate before a search can be conducted, unless there are
reasonable grounds to suspect that evidence would be destroyed in the time that
it would take to obtain one.  Despite the widespread anticipation that some
provisions of the Criminal Procedures Act will be challenged as being
unreasonable infringements of the right to privacy, all South Africans now
generally enjoy protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.<p>
<p>
The legacy of apartheid has left vast numbers of South Africans landless; more
than 8 million people now live in squatter camps which often surround settled
communities.  The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act gives landowners and
local governments the authority to remove informal settlements without
reference to the courts.  Despite widespread preparedness on the part of the
central Government and many local authorities to seek accommodation with
squatters, some municipalities, landowners, and, in one case, rightwing
vigilantes, have demolished shacks as a means of forcing squatters to move.<p>
<p>
Although the problem of forced relocation of residents of informal settlements
was most pronounced prior to the April election, forced relocations continued
throughout the year.  The most notable of these incidents occurred in early
June when the Johannesburg City Council, without securing a court order or
legal judgment, demolished two squatter settlements on city land.  Unauthorized
land invasions by squatters also continued sporadically throughout the year, a
practice severely decried by the Government as inimical to the housing strategy
it devised as part of its Reconstruction and Development Program.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SPAIN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution protects the privacy of the home and correspondence.  Under
the Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before
searching private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private
correspondence.  The antiterrorist law authorizes the Minister of the Interior
to act prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency."   There have
been no complaints of abuse of this authority.<p>
<p>
The Congress of Deputies passed legislation in 1992 broadening police authority
to makes searches and detentions without a court order, mostly in antinarcotics
operations, but in 1993 this law was ruled unconstitutional.  During the 20
months it was in force, this law led to 340 raids and 940 arrests.  Many damage
claims have been filed against the Government.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SRI LANKA</b><p>
<p>
The Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual
privacy and the sanctity of the family and home.  The police obtain proper
warrants for arrests and searches conducted under ordinary law.<p>
<p>
However, the security forces are not required to obtain warrants for searches
conducted under the PTA (see Section 1.e.).  The Secretary of Defense is
responsible for providing oversight for such searches.  There is no judicial
review or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the PTA.<p>
<p>
The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and
correspondence on a selective basis.  The security forces routinely open mail
destined for the LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband.<p>
<p>
The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens.  In 1990 the LTTE evicted
thousands of Muslim residents from their homes in the north.  They currently
live in refugee camps.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ST. KITTS AND NEVIS</b><p>

<p>
<p>
<b>SUDAN</b><p>
<p>
The Government routinely interferes with its citizens' privacy.  Throughout
1994 security forces frequently conducted night searches without warrants.
They targeted persons suspected of political crimes or also, in northern Sudan,
of distilling or consuming illegal alcoholic beverages.  For example, in March
security forces broke up a family ceremony in a private home in memory of 28
officers executed in 1991 for coup plotting.  They arrested and beat 30
participants at the memorial service.<p>
<p>
A wide network of government informants conducted pervasive surveillance in
schools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods.  The authorities
kept key opposition figures under frequent surveillance.  The Government also
continued its practice of summarily dismissing military personnel and other
government employees whose loyalty it suspected.  Dozens lost their jobs
throughout the year.  Security personnel routinely opened and read mail and
tapped telephones.<p>
<p>
Government-instituted neighborhood "popular committees," ostensibly a mechanism
for political mobilization, served as a means for monitoring households.  These
committees caused many Sudanese to be wary of neighbors who could report them
for "suspicious" activities, including "excessive" contact with foreigners.
The committees also furnished or withheld documents essential for obtaining an
exit visa from Sudan.  In high schools, students were sometimes pressured to
join proregime youth groups.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SURINAME</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the right to privacy.  The law requires warrants
for searches, which are issued not by judges but by quasi-judicial officers who
supervise criminal investigations.  The police obtain them in the great
majority of investigations.  The new military command curbed invasions of
privacy by the military such as the illegal monitoring of telephone calls,
monitoring the movements of human rights advocates, and threatening government
officials, policemen, politicians, human rights workers, and journalists.
Although some persons continued these activities on occasion, the military
authorities reportedly did not authorize them to do so.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SWAZILAND</b><p>
<p>
The law requires a warrant from a magistrate before police may search homes or
other premises, and police generally respect this requirement in practice.
However, police officers with the rank of subinspector or higher have the right
to search without a warrant if they believe evidence might be lost through
delay in obtaining a warrant.  While searches without warrants occur
occasionally, the issue of legality of evidence rarely arises in court.
Opponents of the Government complained of unlawful police searches and seizures
but did not seek judicial relief in 1994.<p>
<p>
There is no evidence that the Government systematically monitors private
correspondence or conversations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SWEDEN</b><p>
<p>
The law limits home searches to investigations of crimes punishable by at least
2 years' imprisonment, such as murder, robbery, rape, arson, sabotage,
counterfeiting, or treason.  The authorities respect this provision.  Normally,
police must obtain court approval for a search or wiretap; however, a senior
police officer may approve a search if time is a critical factor or there
appears to be a threat to life.  A parliamentary committee each year reviews
all monitoring of telephones, faxes, or computers.<p>
<p>

The authorities arbitrarily set up security checkpoints on streets and roads.
At these sites, security officials search persons and vehicles without
warrants, looking for weapons, drugs, subversive literature, and smuggled
goods.<p>
<p>
The security services selectively monitor telephone conversations and facsimile
transmissions and interfere with the mail.  In some cases, censors have
prevented the delivery to private citizens of foreign human rights
publications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TAIWAN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution and sections of the criminal and civil codes contain
provisions for privacy.  The authorities generally do not make warrantless
searches, which were common before the lifting of martial law.  A warrant,
issued by a prosecutor or a judge, must be obtained before a search, except
when incidental to arrest.  Critics, however, claim that the "incidental to
arrest" provision is not only unconstitutional but often interpreted broadly by
police to justify searches of locations other than actual sites of arrests.
Moreover, police continue to search cars routinely at roadblocks.<p>
<p>
According to the National Police Administration, warrantless searches are
allowed only in specialized circumstances, such as to arrest an escapee or if
facts indicate a person is in the process of committing a crime and the
circumstances are urgent.  In any such case, the police must file a report with
the prosecutor or court within 24 hours.  Evidence collected without a warrant,
according to regulations, is not excluded from introduction during a trial;
however, a policeman who carries out an illegal search can be sued for illegal
entry and sentenced up to 1 year's imprisonment.<p>
<p>
Although in the past allegations were made that police and security agencies
interfere with the right to privacy through such means as surveillance and
interception of correspondence and telephone calls, there were no reports of
such interference for political purposes in 1994.  According to EY regulations,
judicial and security authorities may file a written request to a prosecutor's
office to monitor telephone calls to collect evidence against a suspect
involved in a major crime.<p>
<p>

<b>TAJIKISTAN</b><p>
<p>
Articles 22 and 23 of the new Constitution and the Criminal Code provide for
the inviolability of the home and prohibit interference with correspondence,
telephone conversations, and postal and communication rights, except "in cases
prescribed by law."  Police may not enter and search a private home without the
approval of the procurator.  In some cases, police may enter and search a home
without permission, but they must then inform the procurator within 24 hours.
Police are permitted to enter and search homes without permission if they have
compelling reason to believe a delay in obtaining a warrant would impair
national security.  There is no judicial review of police searches conducted
without a warrant.  In September the penalties for the violation of the privacy
of correspondence were increased to several years in prison.  Also in
September, the Supreme Soviet raised the maximum sentence for invasion of
privacy of the home from between 2 and 5 years to between 5 and 8 years in
prison.<p>
<p>
Numerous examples of arbitrary illegal search and seizure by government forces
included the August raid by Interior Ministry forces against a predominantly
Garmi and Pamiri neighborhood in the Yuzhni district of Dushanbe.  Security
forces presented no warrants as they rounded up young men, apparently at
random, and took them away.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TANZANIA</b><p>
<p>
The State continued to interfere with these rights, which are generally
provided for in the Constitution.  The CCM has historically penetrated all
levels of society through local cells, varying in size from single-family homes
to large apartment buildings and containing from 10 to 200 persons.  Unpaid
party officials serve as 10-cell leaders with authority to resolve problems at
the grassroots level and to report to authorities any suspicious behavior,
event, or noncompliance with compulsory night patrol service in the
neighborhood.  In 1993 elections were held for new grassroots leaders to
replace the CCM 10-cell leaders in nonparty business.  Because the Government
reversed its position and subsequently held the elections on a party basis,
most of the opposition parties boycotted the elections.  In fact, few voters
participated in these elections, and the former CCM 10-cell leaders retained
nearly all of their power and influence.<p>
<p>
CCM membership is voluntary and is estimated at approximately 2 to 3 million
cardholders.  While in the past CCM membership had been necessary for
advancement in political and other areas, the importance of such membership is
waning.<p>
<p>
The Criminal Procedure Act of 1985 authorizes police officials (including the
civilian anticrime units) to issue search warrants; however, the Act also
authorizes searches of person and premises without a warrant if necessary to
prevent the loss or destruction of evidence connected with an offense or if
circumstances are serious and urgent.  In practice, warrants are rarely
requested, and the police and others search private homes and business
establishments at will.  The security services reportedly monitor telephones
and correspondence of some citizens and selected foreign residents.<p>
<p>
Compulsory participation in local anticrime groups known as "Wasalama" and
"Sungusungu" continued in some areas.  Historically, these groups have operated
only in rural areas to combat cattle rustling and other criminal activity;
however, government ministers continued to promote them vigorously in urban
areas to combat crime.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THAILAND</b><p>
<p>
The law requires police to obtain a warrant prior to a search.  Warrants are
issued by the police with prior Ministry of Interior or provincial governor
approval and are not subject to judicial review.  There were some credible
reports that officers sometimes endorse warrants in advance and then allow
their noncommissioned subordinates to apply them as needed.  The Anti-Communist
Activities Act allows officials engaged in "Communist suppression operations"
to conduct searches without warrants, but these powers rarely have been invoked
in recent years and were not invoked in 1994.<p>
<p>
Thai society is essentially open; membership in political organizations is
voluntary, and the unmonitored exchange of ideas is generally permitted.
However, security services monitor persons espousing leftist or controversial
views, including foreign visitors.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TOGO</b><p>
<p>
In criminal cases, a judge or senior police official may authorize searches of
private residences.  In political and national security cases, the security
forces need no prior authorization.  Police conducted such warrantless searches
extensively, searching for dissidents' arms caches as well as for criminals.
The Government uses telephone taps, monitors correspondence, and maintains the
police and gendarmerie as domestic intelligence services.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TONGA</b><p>
<p>
By law and in practice, no one may enter or search the home of another or
remove any item of property unless in possession of a warrant issued by a
magistrate.  Neither the State nor political organizations intrude arbitrarily
into a person's private life.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO</b><p>
<p>
The authorities generally respected in practice the constitutional provisions
for the rights to security of the person, enjoyment of property, and respect
for private and family life.  Police must obtain search warrants to enter
private property.  There were occasional reports of search warrants or drug
raids executed on the wrong houses, but persons injured in this manner have
redress through a civil action for damages.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TUNISIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person and the home and
for the privacy of correspondence, "except in exceptional cases defined by
law."  Police must have a search warrant, but this requirement is sometimes
ignored in cases in which the authorities consider that state security is
involved or in which a "flagrant crime" is deemed to have been committed.<p>
<p>
The authorities continued to monitor the activities of Islamists and leftists
and searched their homes without warrants.  They frequently harassed the
relatives and associates of such persons by repeatedly interrogating them.
During the year, several human rights monitors and oppositionists accused the
Government of harassment and intimidation.  Police presence in urban areas is
heavy.  Traffic officers routinely stop motorists to examine their identity and
vehicular documents.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TURKEY</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of a person's domicile and the
privacy of correspondence and communication.  Government officials may enter a
private residence or intercept or monitor private correspondence only upon
issuance of a judicial warrant.  These provisions are generally respected in
practice outside the state of emergency region.<p>
<p>
A judge must decide whether to issue a search warrant for a residence.  If
delay may cause harm, prosecutors and municipal officers authorized to carry
out prosecutors' instructions may conduct a search.  Searches of private
premises may not be carried out at night, unless the delay will be damaging or
the search will result in the capture of a prisoner at large.  Exceptions
include persons under special observation by the Security Directorate General,
places anyone can enter at night, places where criminals gather, places where
materials obtained through the Commission of Crimes are kept, gambling
establishments, and brothels.  In the 10 provinces under emergency rule, the
Regional Governor can and does empower security authorities to search without a
warrant residences or the premises of political parties, businesses,
associations, or other organizations.  According to the HRF, the practice of
security authorities in these provinces to search, hold, or seize without
warrant persons, letters, telegrams, and documents is unconstitutional.
Roadblocks are commonplace in the southeast, and security officials regularly
search vehicles and travelers.<p>
<p>
Security forces have compelled the evacuation of villages in the southeast to
prevent villagers from giving aid and comfort to the PKK (see Section 1.g.).
The Government admits to village and hamlet evacuations but claims they occur
as the consequence of pressures by and fear of the PKK and because security
operations against the PKK in the region make continued occupancy unsafe.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TURKMENISTAN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides that a citizen has the right to protection from
arbitrary interference in his or her personal life.  However, there are no
legal means to regulate the conduct of surveillance by the state security
apparatus, which regularly monitors the activities of opponents and critics of
the Government.  Security officials use physical surveillance, telephone
tapping, electronic eavesdropping, and recruit informers.  Critics of the
Government and other citizens report credibly that their mail is intercepted
before delivery.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TUVALU</b><p>
<p>
The Government adheres in practice to the legal protection of privacy of the
home.  It does not arbitrarily intrude into the private life of the
individual.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>UGANDA</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not generally intrude in the privacy, family, or home of
citizens.  The law requires that the police have search warrants before
entering private homes or offices, and this law is generally observed in
practice.  However, the police searched vehicles for weapons at checkpoints
without prior warrants.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND</b><p>
<p>
Warrants are normally required for a police search of private premises.
However, under the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen in
Northern Ireland may enter any premises  if they believe they have "reasonable
grounds of suspicion" that the entry is necessary to preserve peace and
order.<p>
<p>
In Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust of the Government
has deep historical roots, many believe that the conduct of some members of the
security forces in carrying out security checks constitutes unwarranted
harassment and intimidation.  Such allegations also occur in Protestant
neighborhoods, albeit less frequently.  The Government intensively trains
security personnel in proper procedures, but acknowledges that violations of
the rules occasionally occur.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>UKRAINE</b><p>
<p>
Search warrants issued by prosecutors, not judges, are required and utilized in
most cases.  The SBU may, however, conduct intrusive surveillance and searches
without a warrant on national security grounds.  Human rights observers report
receiving no complaints of invasion of privacy by the SBU.  According to the
SBU charter, persons subject to surveillance must be informed after a month's
time.  The Prosecutor General's office has oversight responsibility over the
SBU, but the extent to which it utilizes that authority to monitor SBU
activities and to curb excesses by security officials is unknown.<p>
<p>
The remnants of Soviet control mechanisms survive in many guises.  The militia
stops vehicles arbitrarily in cities, at the borders of cities and towns, and
throughout the countryside.  It needs no probable cause to stop vehicles for an
extensive document check and inspection of all parts of the vehicle and its
contents.  This has become a great source of and inducement to corruption in
the militia:  citizens who often have committed no violation, or only a minor
one, prefer to pay a bribe to avoid time-consuming inspections.  Westerners and
Western vehicles are popular targets of this treatment.  Persons who have
committed serious violations also escape justice by paying bribes to officials,
further undermining the concept of the rule of law.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission,
except in accordance with the law.  Although the police may enter homes without
a warrant and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in
searching premises are subject to review, and he is subject to disciplinary
action if he acts irresponsibly.  Officials other than a police officer must
have a court order to enter a private home.  Local custom places a high value
on privacy, and entry into private homes without the owner's permission is
rare.  There is no known surveillance of private correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>URUGUAY</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the right to privacy.  It states that the home is
absolutely inviolable at night and may be entered and searched only with a
judicial warrant and only during the day.  It provides equally strong
protection for private papers and correspondence, and requires a warrant for
confiscation.  The authorities generally respect these rights and safeguards in
practice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>UZBEKISTAN</b><p>
<p>
By law, search warrants issued by a procurator are required.  There is no
provision for judicial review of search warrants.  There does not appear to be
a legal mechanism for authorizing telephone tapping or monitoring.  Security
agencies nonetheless monitor telephone calls, and there is evidence that they
employ surveillance and wiretap telephones in the cases of persons involved in
opposition political activities.  Certain high- profile opposition activists
were the subject of very visible surveillance, including round-the-clock police
monitoring of all movements.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>VANUATU</b><p>
<p>
There were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or
correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>VENEZUELA</b><p>
<p>
Constitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family,
home, and correspondence.  After the Government suspended the freedom from
search without warrant on June 27, however, the press reported a number of
incidents of searches without warrants by security forces.  According to the
media, DISIP searched the homes of a prominent Caracas businessman and of a
noted intellectual, and the DIM similarly searched 30 homes in the city of
Cumana.  In recent years, there have been some complaints of telephone
surveillance, and human rights monitors accused the security forces of illegal
wiretapping.  In September the Interior Minister announced that the telephones
in his office were being wiretapped, apparently by former employees of his
Ministry.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>VIETNAM</b><p>
<p>
The Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and
control through household registration and party-appointed block wardens who
use informants to keep track of individual activities.  However, many foreign
observers believe this monitoring was done with less scope and efficiency than
in the past, with authorities concentrating on those suspected of involvement
in unauthorized political or religious activities.  Anecdotal evidence suggests
Government monitoring is stricter in the south, especially in Ho Chi Minh City.
Particularly in urban areas, most Vietnamese citizens were free to contact,
talk, and work with foreigners, although many remained nervous about extensive
social contacts.<p>
<p>
The Government continued to selectively censor mail, confiscate packages, and
monitor telephone and facsimile transmissions.  In the past, the Party pressed
people to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages,
city districts, schools, work (trade unions), youth, and women.  However, with
the growth of the private sector, these organizations play a less important
role than in the past.<p>
<p>
While membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government or
in state companies, and vital to promotion to senior levels of the Government,
the Party faced increased difficulty attracting members.  In response, the
Government increased its recruitment efforts and was marginally successful in
attracting new members from the private sector.<p>
<p>
The Government continued to implement a family-planning policy that urges all
families to have no more than two children.  It  sometimes penalized people who
have more than two children by denying promotions or permission to change
jobs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>WESTERN SAHARA</b><p>
<p>
(no information)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>WESTERN SAMOA</b><p>
<p>
Western Samoan law provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure
of property without substantive and procedural safeguards, including search
warrants, which are issued by the judicial branch.  Practically, however, there
is little or no privacy in the village.  Village officials by law must have
permission to enter homes, but there can be substantial social pressure to
grant such permission.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>YEMEN</b><p>
<p>
Despite constitutional provisions against such interference, security forces
routinely search homes, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise
intrude into personal matters for alleged security considerations.  Such
activities are conducted without warrants issued by legal authorities or other
judicial supervision.  Many citizens believe that the security forces monitor
telephone conversations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ZAIRE</b><p>
<p>
Security forces routinely ignore the Constitution's provision for the
inviolability of the home and of private correspondence.  They ignore the
requirement for a search warrant, entering and searching homes at will.  Under
the pretext of searching for arms, troops entered and looted the home of a
leader of the radical opposition in Kinshasa; troops also looted the home of an
urban commissar in Kolwezi.  Human rights monitors and the press report
numerous other instances in which gangs believed to be security forces entered
and looted private homes, sometimes abusing or threatening the residents.  In
many of these cases, simple robbery, rather than political intimidation,
appeared to be the motive.  Citizens widely assume that the Government monitors
mail and telephone communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ZAMBIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of the
home, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.  Except
during a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may enter
a home.  Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace
continued.  According to the government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration
officials are empowered under the law to conduct these roundups without a
warrant.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ZIMBABWE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or entry, and since
the lifting of the State of Emergency (SOE) in June 1990, these protections
have been generally respected.  It is widely known, however, that the
Government monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularly
international communications.<p>
<p>
Although the need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted,
pursuant to the 1992 Land Acquisition Act farmers whose lands have been
designated for acquisition may only appeal the amount of compensation in
administrative courts, not the decision to acquire their farms.<p>
<p>
The Act has been implemented largely along racial lines; the Government stated
that black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to designation.  In some
cases, land has been designated for acquisition to achieve political goals.
The designation of former Member of Parliament (M.P.) Henry Ellsworth's home
farm for acquisition, highlighted in the 1993 Human Rights Report as an example
of the Land Acquisition Act's use as a political tool, has been revoked.
However, opposition party leader Ndabaningi Sithole is still fighting the
Government's acquisition of his Churu farm.  After the Government's late 1993
attempt to evict more than 2,500 families living on the property, several
thousand Churu farm residents were resettled on a holding farm where several
died as the result of abysmal sanitary conditions.  The situation at Churu farm
remained at a standoff until October 1994, when the ZRP evicted the remaining
1,600 residents and resettled them at a camp formerly used by Mozambican
refugees.<p>
