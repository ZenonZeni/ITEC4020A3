<CENTER><B>VALUABLE FEED CO-PRODUCT HANDBOOKS NOW AVAILABLE</B></CENTER>
<P>
Chicago, IL -- Reflecting the growing importance
of byproducts to the economic viability of ethanol production,
the domestic ethanol industry and the nation's corn growers have
jointly produced two corn co-product reference handbooks describing
the numerous high quality corn co-products available to the feed
industry.<BR>
<P>
&quot;These handbooks are the most comprehensive
compilation to date of technical data regarding corn co-products,&quot;
said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association.
 &quot;They will be an instrumental tool in marketing the 1.4
billion tons of byproducts that are produced each year to livestock
producers.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The guides, <I>&quot;Feed Co-Products of the Corn
Wet Milling Process&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;Feed Co-Products of
the Corn Dry Milling Process,&quot;</I> provide valuable information
for the feeding industry on the nutritional, economic, production
and use value of corn co-products.  Each handbook contains a description
of the manufacturing of ethanol process, nutrient composition,
livestock feeding trials, recommended feeding levels and references.
<BR>
<P>
The processes of producing ethanol for fuel and beverage
alcohol utilize only the starch portion of the grain, leaving
behind high-value, high-protein, high-vitamin content feed products
called distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed.  These feeds
can provide a nourishing supplement to livestock and poultry diets.
 <BR>
<P>
&quot;Co-products from the milling of corn have important
nutritional properties that add value to feeding rations and livestock
programs,&quot; said Jerry Weigel, Director of Nutrition and Regulatory
Affairs at ExSeed Genetics, L.L.C., and chief author of the handbooks.
 &quot;The books will be a valuable resource tool for dairy producers,
cattle feeders, the poultry industry, nutritionists, feed consultants,
veterinarians and feed sales personnel.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;The availability of corn co-products provides
a cost-competitive feed on a per-head basis,&quot; said Lucy Norton,
Domestic Market Development Director of the Iowa Corn Growers
Association.  &quot;Corn co-products compete with other feed ingredients,
helping to reduce overall feed grain costs to the producer.&quot;
