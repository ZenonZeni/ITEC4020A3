<H1><A NAME="Header_658" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_658">Rating Web sites and serving rated Web information</A></H1>
Rating Web Sites and Information
<P>Using the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS),
users of Internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, FTP, and
Gopher,
can filter the material they
encounter and accept or reject the material based on its ratings.
This filtering
allows parents, businesses, schools, or discerning individuals
to block the access to inappropriate and objectionable material.
For the most up-to-date PICS information, see
the World Wide Web Consortium's PICS Web site
(http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/).
The specifications published at this Web site enable:
<UL>
<P><LI>Content providers (people who publish
information on the Web) to rate and label their own
documents.  These can be HTML files, or other files
that contain images, sound, or animations.
<P><LI>Independent rating services
to rate and label documents published by other Web sites and
to distribute the labels to whomever requests them.
<P><LI>Internet users (browsers and other clients) to request these
labels and determine how to handle rated and unrated information.
</UL>
<P>The Internet Connection Secure Server makes it easy for you to store and
serve the rating
labels for the documents you publish.  It also allows you to
act as a rating service or label bureau
by providing a means for you to maintain and
distribute rating labels for other Web sites.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_659" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_659">Who can rate Web sites</A></H2>
<P>
Web sites can rate themselves or be rated by a third party, called a
<B><I>rating service</I></B>.  A rating service evaluates Web
content according to their own published criteria
and then distributes the labels
through a <B><I>label bureau</I></B>.  Often a rating service acts
as its own label bureau and distributes its own labels.
<P>Some rating services will also
give you assistance in assessing
and labeling your own site and documents.
The World Wide Web Consortium publishes a list of PICS self-rating
services at
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/selfrat.htm.
<P>
The PICS specification does not determine who can or will act as
a rating service.
The World Wide Web Consortium publishes a list of PICS third-party
rating services
at http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/pics.htm.
In addition, anyone who wants to
can set up a rating service.  You can set up such a service by:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Deciding on a rating system
<LI>Publishing the rating system
<LI>Rating documents and creating the rating labels
<LI>Establishing a Web site (URL) that clients can access to
get your labels
</UL>
<P>A rating service can choose any criteria on which to rate Web sites.
While some might
rate Web sites for their violence or sexual content,
others could choose to rate educational content, political correctness,
or even how "cool" the site is.  Also, a rating service can
rate any and all Web sites that it wants to rate.
<P>
Having your Web site and pages rated is often desirable.
In fact, it may even be necessary for your Web site
to be rated in order to be viewed by a PICS-enabled client.
Understanding how Web clients use the PICS labels and ratings
will help make this clear.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_660" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_660">How Web clients use PICS</A></H2>
<P>PICS-enabled clients allow the users to determine which rating
services they want to use and, for each rating service, which
ratings are acceptable and which are unacceptable.
<P>
For example,
a family might choose a rating service that rates documents
according to their sexual content.  The rating service might have a low
rating for romance, a higher rating for passionate kissing,
and yet higher ratings for more explicit sexual activity.
The parents might
decide that documents containing romance are the highest acceptable
rating for their household.
They would then configure their browser to
reject all documents that are unrated or contain a higher
rating from this rating service.
<P>In another example, the Hi-Tek Systems Corporation could label its
own documents with a "For Hi-Tek Use Only" and could equip all its
employees with browsers configured to accept only documents with
that rating.
<P>There are several steps in this process:
<DL>
<P><DT><B>The client sends a request
</B><DD>
When a PICS-enabled client requests a document,
it indicates in the request
which rating services are of interest.
For example, assume these parents had configured their
browser to evaluate rating labels
from <CITE>The Best</CITE> rating service.
When their children click a link to an
HTML document, the browser
request would also ask for the rating labels that were assigned to
the document by this rating service.
<P><DT><B>The server sends a response
</B><DD>
Assume the PICS-enabled server has a copy of
the labels the client is requesting.
When the server receives the client's request, it
sends the labels along with the requested document.
However, if the server does not support PICS or does not have copies of
labels from that particular rating service,
it sends the requested document anyway.
<P><DT><B>The client checks the server response first
</B><DD>
The client first checks to see if the requested ratings labels
are imbedded in the document (in the meta information)
or if they were sent along with the document.
Some clients might accept
rating information that is imbedded in the file.
Others might require a separate label from a registered rating
service and a guarantee that it was created by that service.
If the client successfully finds the label
information it wanted, it evaluates
the rating and either displays the document or blocks it and displays a
message.
<P><DT><B>The client contacts the rating service, if necessary
</B><DD>
If the client does not receive the label information with the requested
document from the server, it might send a subsequent
request directly to the rating service asking
for the label information for that document.
This requires a second connection, which
takes longer and can discourage future visits to that site.
The browser waits until the label information is returned before
it displays <B>any</B> data.
<P>
Faster response time is the main reason why
rating labels for a site should reside <B>at the site</B>.
</DL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_661" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_661">How the Internet Connection Secure Server helps you manage PICS labels</A></H2>
<P>
Whether your Web server publishes Web documents
or you are a rating service and want
to provide the labels for other Web sites, the Internet Connection Secure Server
can help you manage PICS labels.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_662" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_662">PICS for Web site administrators</A></H3>
<P>As more browsers are configured to block access to
unrated documents, it behooves you to have your
Web site rated.  And because it saves time when a browser can get
the ratings when it sends its initial request, it
behooves you to store the ratings for your pages
on your own server.
With the Internet Connection Secure Server's PICS support,
you can manage the labels from one central file and serve them
with requested pages and documents.
These labels can be:
<UL>
<P><LI>Self-assessed according to your own criteria
<P>If you are establishing your own rating service, you can rate
your own site according to your published criteria.
<P><LI>Self-assessed
according to the published criteria of a voluntary rating service
<P>
Voluntary rating services, such as SafeSurf (http://www.safesurf.com)
trust Web administrators to be honest in
the assessment of their own pages.
<P><LI>Assessed by a third-party rating service according to the service's
criteria
<P>
In this case, you might contact the rating service and request
that they rate your Web site (if they have not already done so)
and send you the label information.
In fact, you might want to contact several
rating services to have your site rated for different subject
criteria.
If the third-party rating services have the Internet Connection Secure Server,
this process can be simplified with an electronic request.  See
<A HREF="#HDRRPL">"How to request PICS label information"</A>.
</UL>
Once the ratings are established,
Web administrators can do one of three things:
<UL>
<P><LI>Manually edit each of their HTML files, inserting the rating
information in the headers.
See <A HREF="#HDRMPL1">"Managing PICS labels for your Web site in each document"</A>.
<P><LI>Use the label information to create PICS-compliant rating labels,
store the labels in their file system, and
use the Internet Connection Secure Server's
PICS configuration file to manage and transmit them.
See <A HREF="#HDRMPL2">"Managing PICS labels for your Web site from a central file"</A>.
<P><LI>Let the system automatically store the transmitted rating labels
and update your PICS configuration file for you.  This can only
be done when electronically requesting labels for a third-party
rating service that has the Internet Connection Secure Server.
See <A HREF="#HDRRPL">"How to request PICS label information"</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRMPL1">Managing PICS labels for your Web site in each document</A></H4>
<P>You can edit
each of your HTML files and embed PICS ratings
information in the meta element of the document header.
This process is entirely manual and therefore time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to maintain.  It does not incorporate
any of the security mechanisms (message digest, digital signature, etc.)
that would guarantee the validity
of the label, if this is important to the requesting client.
The PICS specification (http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/)
explains how you can embed rating information
in each document.  It is not covered here.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRMPL2">Managing PICS labels for your Web site from a central file</A></H4>
<P>
The Internet Connection Secure Server's
PICS support allows you to store the rating labels
for all the documents on your Web site and manage them from
a central file.  The labels are sent
along with your Web pages when a client requests them.
<P>In addition to the rating labels,
you must also have a PICS-compliant rating system description
file that describes the rating system
used to rate your documents.  These are called RAT files, and
rating services will provide them along with their labels.
<P>
Once you have both the labels and the RAT file, you can use the
PICS configuration file
to manage these labels from a central point.
See <A HREF="#HDRMCF">"How to manage PICS labels from a central file"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_665" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_665">PICS for rating services and label bureaus</A></H3>
<P>Because many Web sites will want their pages rated, you have
an opportunity to provide a service to a large number of Web sites.
<UL>
<P><LI>
Content providers will contact your organization to request that you
rate their Web site and provide them with the labels so that
they will be able to
serve the labels along with their Web documents themselves.
<P><LI>
Clients will connect to your server electronically to
request labels for pages they are attempting to view only when
they <B><I>cannot</I></B> get the label information with the
requested pages.
</UL>
<P>
The PICS configuration file provides you with the means to manage
the labels for other Web sites and transmit them when requested.
<P>
The PICS specifications allow anyone
to set up a rating service, define the criteria by which they rate
Web sites and documents, and then provide the ratings.
With the Internet Connection Secure Server's PICS support,
you can
establish your server as a rating service
and maintain and distribute labels for other Web sites.
You can rate
documents at a Web site individually or use wildcard characters to
quickly assign the same rating to all or part of a Web site's offerings.
You will need to create these labels and your own RAT file.
The RAT file is a PICS-compliant rating
file that describes the rating system
used to rate documents.
Once you have both the labels and the RAT file, you can use the
PICS configuration file
to manage these labels from a central point.
Your server will then be able to automatically send the
rating labels you have assigned when a client requests them.
See <A HREF="#HDRMCF">"How to manage PICS labels from a central file"</A>.
<P>
If a Web site that you have rated requests the labels for their
pages, you can also provide them with all their current ratings.
Unfortunately,
the World Wide Web Consortium has not yet defined a standard
for the label bureaus or rating services to send a Web site
all their label information.
This means that the method
for this exchange will have to be determined by the
rating services and the Web sites that ask for them.
<P>
If the Web sites and the rating service (or label bureau) both
have the Internet Connection Secure Server, they can electronically exchange
rating labels and label entries for their PICS configuration file.
In this case, the rating labels will be automatically stored on the
server and the PICS configuration file will be updated so that it
can transmit the labels with the requested documents.
<P>
If not, we are assuming that the rating services will send a
file of all the required label information to the Web site
administrators.
Once the administrators receive this information,
they will use whatever method is available on their server
to create PICS rating labels and enable their server to transmit them
with the requested documents.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRMCF" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_666">How to manage PICS labels from a central file</A></H2>
<P>
Managing PICS labels on the Internet Connection Secure Server
requires three things:
<OL>
<P><LI>A rating (RAT) file that describes the ratings
<P>If you are starting your own rating service or label bureau,
you will need to create a file that describes your rating system.
This file must be in the
machine-readable format detailed in the PICS
technical specifications and it should
have the <B>.rat</B> extension.
If you are getting your labels from a third-party
rating service, you must also get a copy of their RAT file.
<P><LI>The rating labels themselves
<P>
Whether you are maintaining labels for your own Web site or, as a rating
service, maintaining labels for other sites,  you will need to store the
labels in your server's file system, one label per file.
Rating services will rate documents on the Internet and create
the rating label files themselves.  Web sites will either rate their
own site and create the label files or they will request the rating
labels from third-party rating services.
<P>
If you are getting your rating labels
from a third-party rating service that
also has the Internet Connection Secure Server, you can request the labels
electronically and they will be sent and stored directly on your
system for you.  Otherwise, you may need to do some editing of the
information you receive before creating rating labels to store in your
file system.
<P>
When creating PICS rating labels, be sure to follow the PICS
specification.
See <A HREF="#HDRCPL">"How to create PICS labels"</A>.
We recommend you use <B>.lbl</B> for the
extension on your label files and we have included
a predefined AddType directive in the configuration file
for this extension.
<P><LI>The PICS configuration file
<P>This file provides a mapping between the actual rating labels
and the documents they rate.  It enables the server to quickly respond
to HTTP, FTP, and Gopher requests.
If you are getting your rating labels
from a third-party rating service that
also has the Internet Connection Secure Server, your PICS configuration file
will automatically be updated with entries for the labels you receive.
If you are a
rating service or if you receive rating labels from
third-party rating services that have a different server, you
will need to maintain the PICS configuration file yourself.
You can use the online Configuration and Administration Forms
to update and maintain this file or you can edit it manually.
See <A HREF="#HDRUCF">"How to update the PICS configuration file"</A>.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_667" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_667">Storing the PICS files on your server</A></H3>
<P>You will need to
store both the RAT file and rating labels in files on your server.
<P>
The RAT file should be available from
a rating service's Web site.
The rating labels must be stored one label per file.
<P>
You can use any directories, subdirectories, and file names that
make sense at your site and for your implementation.  We recommend that
Web sites
have a separate directory or subdirectory for each third-party
rating service that they use.  This is <B>required</B>
for automatic updates when requesting
labels from rating services that have the Internet Connection Secure Server.
<P>
Our examples
use a file extension of <B><I>.lbl</I></B> on each rating label file.
This is also the extension for any label files the Internet Connection Secure Server
transmits electronically.

a central point and serve them when clients request them.
You can use the online Configuration and Administration forms
to add, modify, and delete the label entries in the
PICS configuration file, or you can edit the file and
maintain the data manually.

The exact name and location of the PICS configuration file is
<VAR>ETC</VAR>/ICS_PICS.CNF
(where <VAR>ETC</VAR> represents the directory specified by the
ETC environment variable in the CONFIG.SYS configuration file).
<P>
The configuration file consists of a list of paragraphs.
There are three types of paragraphs.
<UL>
<P><LI><B>LabelsFor</B>
<P>
Specifies the ratings given
by a particular rating service for documents on a given Web server.
For example, one LabelsFor paragraph could cover ratings according
to the RSAC rating system for documents on the local server,
while another paragraph could cover ratings according to the
The Best rating system for documents on the local server.
<P><LI><B>DefineService</B>
<P>Lists local label files associated with a third-party rating service.
<P><LI><B>DefineLBService</B>
<P>Lists local label files associated with your
own label bureau or rating service.
</UL>
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>The PICS configuration file associates
Web documents with files containing labels. The labels themselves
are stored in separate files, not in the PICS configuration file.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_676">PICS configuration file syntax</A></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_677">LabelsFor</A></H5>
<P>
The first line of the paragraph consists of the keyword
<TT>LabelsFor</TT>,
the name of the server on which the rated documents are found,
the name of the rating service, and an opening brace.
The body of the paragraph specifies labels for sets of documents.
Each paragraph ends with a closing brace.
<P>
<PRE>
LabelsFor servername servicename {
    /WebPath1/document1    /path/LabelFile1
    /WebPath2/document2    /path/LabelFile2
    ...and so on...
}
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><I>servername
</I><DD>This can be the keyword <TT>LOCAL</TT>
to indicate documents on this server,
or it can be a full URL if documents on remote servers are being rated.
Only servers acting as label bureaus (rating services)
will need to use a
hostname other than <TT>LOCAL</TT>.
When your server is providing labels for
the documents it hosts, you should always use the keyword
<TT>LOCAL</TT> for the hostname.
Note that you must specify the protocol and hostname without
a trailing slash; thus, <TT>http://www.xyz.com</TT>
is acceptable as a hostname on a LabelsFor line, but
<TT>http://www.xyz.com/</TT> is not.
<P><DT><I>servicename
</I><DD>The full URL where clients will send their label requests.
<P><DT><I>/WebPath/document
</I><DD>The Web path and name of the document being rated.
This is the path a
Web client would use when requesting the document. For example,
if the Naughty/Image1.gif was on the server <TT>www.rated.xyz.com</TT>,
then a Web client would request
<TT>http://www.rated.xyz.com/Naughty/Image1.gif</TT>.
<P><B>Note: </B>You can use wildcard characters (*)
to rate multiple documents at once.
See <A HREF="#HDRUSEWC">"Using wildcards in the PICS configuration file"</A>.
<P><DT><I>/path/LabelFile
</I><DD>The fully qualified name of the label file in your
file system.
(This includes the drive name.)
<P>
You cannot use wildcard characters in file names.
<P>
<P>A special keyword, <TT>NOTLABELED</TT>,
can be used in place
of a label file name. This indicates that the given file(s) cannot be
labeled; it serves as a shorthand way of creating a label file that
contains a "not-rated" label. In the example above, a not-rated
error message will be returned to any
clients who request a rating for the file /Unknown.html.
</DL>
<P>For example,
an actual LabelsFor paragraph might look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
LabelsFor LOCAL http://www.rsac.org/ratingsv01.html {
    /Naughty/Image1.gif  d&#58;\www\pics\labels\AdultsOnly.lbl
    /Clean/*.html        d&#58;\www\pics\labels\AllAges.lbl
    /Unknown.html        NOTLABELED
}
</PRE>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_678">DefineService</A></H5>
<P>
The first line of the paragraph consists of the keyword
<TT>DefineService</TT>,
the rating service URL, the quoted name of the rating service,
the location and name of the service's RAT file,
and an opening brace.
The body of the paragraph lists
the label files associated with this service,
specifying each one with the keyword <TT>LABELFILE</TT>.
Each paragraph ends with a closing brace.
<PRE>
DefineService servicename "name-of-service" ratingfile {
     LABELFILE  /path/LabelFile1 "description"
     LABELFILE  /path/LabelFile2 "description"
     ...and so on...
}
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><I>servicename
</I><DD>The name (URL) of the rating service.
<P><DT><I>name-of-service
</I><DD>The name (text) of the rating service, in quotes.
<P><DT><I>ratingfile
</I><DD>The fully qualified name of the service's RAT file in your
file system.
(This includes the drive name.)
<P><DT><I>/path/LabelFile
</I><DD>The fully qualified name of the label file in your
file system.
(This includes the drive name.)
<P><DT><I>description
</I><DD>A text description of the label, in quotes.
</DL>
<P>For example,
an actual DefineService paragraph might look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
DefineService http://www.abc.org/rate.html "The ABC's of Ratings" d:\www\pics\rat\abc.rat {
    LABELFILE  d&#58;\www\pics\labels\AdultsOnly.lbl  "rated XXX"
    LABELFILE  d&#58;\www\pics\labels\AllAges.lbl     "rated GGG"
}
</PRE>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_679">DefineLBService</A></H5>
<P>This paragraph has the same syntax and format as the
<TT>DefineService</TT> paragraph.  The only difference is that
it uses the <TT>DefineLBService</TT> keyword and the RAT file and
labels that it lists are for your own label bureau and rating service.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRUSEWC" HREF="icswg007.html#PToC_680">Using wildcards in the PICS configuration file</A></H3>
<P>You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard only in the LabelsFor
paragraphs of the PICS configuration file.
When using wildcards, remember that
the order of entries within a paragraph is important.
For each paragraph, the Internet Connection Secure Server
breaks the list of rated documents into two parts: those that
contain wildcards, and those that do not contain wildcards.
<UL>
<P><LI>When the server looks for labels for
a document, it will first try to find the document in the "no-wildcards"
list. Order is <B>unimportant</B> here.  Without wildcards, each
entry in the list refers to exactly one document.
<P><LI>If the server cannot find a match in the "no-wildcards" list,
it will try to match the document name
against the entries that contain wildcards.
Order is <B>important</B>  The server
tries to match the requested document against the wildcard entries
in the order in which they appear in the configuration file
and will use the first entry that matches.
</UL>
<P>
For example, if you want an entry that
gives <TT>/*</TT> as the WebPath/document, serving as a catchall
for documents that don't have another rating, then make this
the last entry in the paragraph.
