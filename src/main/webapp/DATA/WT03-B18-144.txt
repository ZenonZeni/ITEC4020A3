</P>

<P>During the three years of very hard work in the Auto/Oil Programme an
EU strategy has been developed to deliver the least-cost measures to meet
the agreed reference air quality values on the five pollutants of concern.
On 18th June, the European Commission adopted two of the legislative proposals
required to implement the strategy. These proposals are now submitted to
the European Parliament and Council for adoption before they can become
legislation. </P>

<P>The most costly of the two proposals, and the one which provides the
largest benefit in terms of air quality, concerns the setting of tighter
emissions standards for passenger cars. The other proposal, providing smaller
but commensurate benefits, concerns tightening of fuel specifications for
gasoline and diesel fuel. Both proposals are intended to be implemented
by 1st January 2000. Further legislative proposals will be presented next
year concerning emissions standards for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles,
and vehicle inspection and maintenance. Moreover, the Commission has suggested
a follow-up to the Auto/Oil programme to evaluate the need for further
measures, and other EU initiatives are underway which target stationary
source emission controls.</P>

<P>The main changes to gasoline and diesel fuel quality specifications
are shown in the two tables below. The changes in the average qualities
for these transport fuels marketed in the EU, which are intended to result
from the specifications, are also given. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Table5-1.gif" HEIGHT=356 WIDTH=556></P></CENTER>

<P>The total cost of the Auto/Oil package is predicted at some 82.5 billion
ECU Net Present Value (NPV) over 15 years. Of this, the oil industry’s
costs in implementing fuels changes will be in the region of 11.5 billion
ECU ($15 billion). Most of this is upfront capital investment of 7.2 billion
ECU. In practical terms, this means that, on average, every oil refinery
in the EU will have to find roughly $80 million to assure compliance. The
word ‘average’ should be treated with caution because, for example, there
are a few complex refineries with low sulphur crude slates that will need
to do very little; some other refineries will be very hard hit. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>EMISSION&nbsp;REDUCTIONS&nbsp;DUE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;IMPROVED&nbsp;FUELS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The methodology used does not require that the contribution to the overall
emissions reductions due to the fuels part of the package should be in
approximately the same proportion as its share of the package costs (around
15 per cent). In fact, the fuels measures were only just selected as they
are among the least cost-effective of the measures chosen. Only benzene
(-15 to -20 per cent, but amounting to only a kilotonne or so of emissions
by 2010) and to a much lesser extent particulate matter (Pm, -6 per cent)
are reduced anything like commensurately by the fuels measures. The reductions
of NOx and VOCs are only a few per cent at best (see <A HREF="../VOLUME5/Contents.htm">CONCAWE
Review Volume 5, Number 1 (April 1996)</A>, pages 10 and 11 for more on
this). The small fuels effects on these particularly important pollutants
means that extreme fuel formulations with steeply higher costs, such as
Californian style gasoline and Swedish city diesel, are inappropriate for
general application across Europe.</P>

<P>The oil industry believes that, overall, the fuels proposals constitute
a well-judged response in an optimum package to meet real environmental
needs. Clearly, there is now much to do to inform properly those bodies
reviewing the proposals. If this is successful, it is expected that this
draft legislation will be adopted by the EU in the next year or two. </P>
