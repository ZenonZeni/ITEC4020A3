	<H3><CENTER>New Scientific Assessment Reveals Global Biodiversity<BR>
	At Greater Risk Than Previous Data Revealed </CENTER></H3>


	<P>Washington, D.C. -- Fully a quarter of all known mammal species are at risk of extinction, according to the most comprehensive scientific assessment of threatened species ever produced -- the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals.  (The Red List is available for $40 from <A HREF="http://www.islandpress.com">Island Press</A>.)
	

<P>For the first time, all known mammals were assessed for their conservation status,  revealing a much greater number threatened with extinction than previously believed.  Until this assessment, the status of birds was used to estimate other species' levels of endangerment, because birds were the only species fully assessed.  The Red List classifies 11 percent of all known bird species as threatened with extinction. The finding that mammals are even more seriously threatened with extinction increases the urgency of global conservation measures.  Of  the reptiles, amphibians and fish assessed, estimates of those threatened with extinction are: 20 percent of reptiles, 25 percent of amphibians, and 34 percent of fish, mostly freshwater species.
	

<P>The Species Survival Commission (SSC) and its co-publishing partner Conservation International (CI) announced these findings in Washington, D.C. today.  The document will be available on the World Wide Web as of Oct. 7 at <A HREF="http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html" TARGET="new">http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html</A>.


	

<P>"The Red List is actually a red flag, warning us about the perilous status of animals and drawing attention to threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, over-harvesting and the introduction of non-native species," said George Rabb, chair of  the SSC, a volunteer global  network of scientists.
 	

<P>"This scientific assessment is indisputable proof that warnings about global biological diversity loss haven't been exaggerated -- if anything we've been too optimistic," said Russell A. Mittermeier, Conservation International president and chair of the SSC's Primate Specialist Group.
	

<P>More rigorous criteria were used to assess the conservation status of species for the 1996 List, which includes for the first time information about threats.  The new system provides alternative approaches to assessing threat, such as population decline, fragmentation of populations or low population numbers.  More than 500 scientists provided data and carried out the List assessments, with SSC partners BirdLife International, The Nature Conservancy and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre being major contributors as well.
 	

<P>The List identifies 5,205 species as threatened with extinction. Different objective approaches were used to assess levels of endangerment, including rate of population decline over a ten-year period.  Using this criterion, critically endangered species have experienced an 80 percent decline; endangered, 50 percent; and vulnerable, 20 percent decline. 
	 

<P>Of the 26 orders of mammals, 24 include threatened species, and the six largest orders have more than 50 threatened species each. The highest proportion of threatened species are in the orders that include monkeys and apes, 46 percent;  shrews and moles, 36 percent;  pigs, antelope and cattle, 33 percent; bats, 26 percent;  wild dogs, bears and cats, 26 percent; and rodents, 17 percent.  Other, smaller orders are also highly threatened,  including the order with horses, tapirs and rhinos, with 22 percent critically endangered.
	

<P>Of  the 27 orders of birds, 23 contain threatened species.  The five orders with the highest percent of threatened species are those that include rails and cranes, 26 percent; pheasants and partridges,  25 percent;  parrots,  25 percent; pigeons and doves, 17 percent; and kingfishers and bee-eaters, 12 percent.
	

<P>Among reptiles, of the 23 species of crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators, caimans), 44  percent are threatened.  While this figure is high, crocodilians are one of the few orders that have improved in status due to conservation measures.   In 1971, all 23 species of crocodilians were endangered.  Today, seven species are abundant enough to allow sustainable use for the skins trade, and five species have stable or increasing populations.
	

<P>More than 100 species of marine fishes were added to the 1996 Red List, including sharks, tuna, coral reef fish and seahorses.  While the status of the remaining 14,000 marine species have yet to be assessed, the recent additions indicate that many marine species could be at higher risk than previously thought.  All species of sturgeons and paddlefish were found to be threatened or near threatened.  Many freshwater species from other groups are also classified as threatened because land use changes have led to the deterioration of freshwater habitats worldwide.
	

<P>While most animal species are invertebrates, the Red List points out that very few have been assessed relative to their total numbers.  Those that have received the most attention are crustaceans, insects and molluscs, with more threatened molluscs included in the Red List than any other invertebrate group.  Out of 70,000 documented mollusc species, some 2,049 species were assessed, of which 920 were identified as threatened.
	 

<P>The United States is among the top 20 countries with the most threatened species of mammals,  and among the top 10 with the most threatened species of birds.  The top five countries with the most threatened number of mammals include Indonesia, China, India, Brazil and Mexico.  The top five with the most threatened species of birds are Indonesia, Brazil, China, the Philippines, and India.
	

<P>The most significant threat to the majority of species at risk of extinction was found to be habitat reduction, fragmentation and degradation, reflecting human population growth combined with economic development.  A surprisingly important factor was introduction of non-native species, along with exploitation, pollution and climate change.
	

<P>The Red List originated in 1960 as a set of index cards containing information on 34 mammals on file at the SSC Secretariat in London.  The 1996 Red List marks three decades of international efforts for the conservation of the world's biodiversity, and its publication coincides with the World Conservation Congress of IUCN-The World Conservation Union, to be held in Montreal, Canada, October 13-23, 1996. 
	

<P>The SSC is one of six commissions within the IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature).  The SSC works to conserve biological diversity with programs to study, save, restore and manage wisely species and their habitats.  The SSC volunteer network includes more than 7,000 scientists, field researchers, government officials and conservation leaders from 179 countries.
	


	

<P>The 1996 Red List was made possible, in part, due to a generous grant from the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation.
