SLANTS & TRENDS

FISHER'S VIEWS ON TITLE III:  The pressue on industrial companies resulting
from annual reports of routine toxic releases under the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) will continue to build, said
Environmental Protection Agency Assistant Administrator Linda Fisher.

'MORE AND MORE PEOPLE are paying more attention" to EPCRA because all
companies want their emission numbers to improve year by year, she said
Dec. 15.  "Information in the public's hands is a powerful tool, and it
has allowed, in a sense, industry to fix itself, which is probably a more
effective way than others."

THE LAW HAS BEEN 'VERY EFFECTIVE,' Fisher told TMN.  "When you have the
head of Monsanto or Du Pont or even small companies saying, 'I am making a
concerted effort to change behavior in my plant so we don't emit as much of
a toxic chemical,' that to me is a very postive thing."  Du Pont Inc.
Chairman E.S. Woolard stated Dec. 12 that the company would try to cut
toxic air emissions by 60 percent by 1993 (TMN, Dec. 20, 1989).
Monsanto Co. Chairman Richard J.  Mahoney said June 30, 1988, that the
company would cut toxic emissions world-wide by 90 percent by December
1992.

CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION members are being urged to take part in
the April 22 anniversary celebrations of Earth Day.  CMA is providing
members with ideas for getting their facilities involved in community
activities.  Allied Signal's Fluorine Products Division, Morristown, N.J.,
said it will purchase and donate a siren system to the county, CMA noted in
a release.  The system will be operated through the county emergency
services agency to warn residents of hazardous materials spills, fires and
natural disasters.

SOLKATRONIC CHEMICALS INC., Morrisville, Pa., donated a weather station to
communities surrounding its facility, held a seminar for local officials
on chemical dispersion modeling and donated equipment and funds to the
Bucks County Hazardous Incident Response Team.

NRC REPORTS DOE NUCLEAR SITE WORKERS
AT RISK FROM CHEMICALS AND RADIATION

     Workers at virtually every facility in the Department of Energy's
(DOE) 17-site nuclear weapons complex are at risk due to contamination of
the plants by radioactive and other hazardous materials, says a report
released Dec. 20 by the National Research Council (NRC).

     However, chemical hazards at DOE's weapons plants probably pose the
greatest threat to workers' health, notes "The Nuclear Weapons Complex:
Management for Health, Safety and the Environment."  While substantial
progress has been made in controlling exposure to ionizing radiation, there
appears to be a less than adequate emphasis at DOE's plants on hazards
associated with exposures to chemicals routinely used in industrial
operations, NRC says.  The substances of greatest concern include
beryllium, asbestos, cutting oils, organic solvents and plating solutions.

     "Occupational medical programs within the complex should increase the
emphasis placed on protection of workers from chemicals suspected to be
hazardous at the acute, subacute or chronic level of exposure," NRC
recommends.  The council suggests "removal of the worker from the hazard,
as in the case of pregnant workers," as one type of "control" for handling
toxic materials.  So-called "fetal protection policies" have come under
fire in federal courts as discriminatory (TMN, Nov. 1, 1989).

     The collection of health-related data concerning employees in the
nuclear weapons complex is inadequate with regard to both the kinds of data
collected and how they are stored, NRC says.  To correct the situation, the
report urges DOE to improve monitoring and surveillance programs for
exposure to hazardous substances through the use of standardized protocols
for data collection and analysis.  "In particular, data collected within
the complex should be comprehensive, accessible and comparable," the report
advises.

     NRC also cites as inadequate the fire control programs and the efforts
to control inhalation of radioactive dust by workers.  At least two
facilities have plutonium in their exhaust ducts, it notes.

     Blame for some of the problems lies with DOE's "complex management
structure with ambiguous lines of responsibility and authority," the NRC
says.  The report suggests that safety and other related decisions should
be made "at the lowest possible management levels."  DOE has accumulated a
great deal of information on the effects of exposure to radiation and this
should be made available for study, NRC adds.  DOE officials have promised
action on this issue.  The report is available for $15 from the National
Academy Press, 2101 Con?stitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20418; phone
202/334-2138 or 800/624-6242.

KENTUCKY'S DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEP) has drafted a
comprehensive plan to strengthen environmental regulations.  The proposals
for toxic materials include:  installing air monitoring net?works in
selected areas; requiring waste reduction audits; proposing legislation to
have industry partially fund research on toxic effects; setting up a risk
assessment department in DEP; and monitoring ground water near hazardous
waste sites, land farms and under-ground storage tanks.  The department,
which intends to seek funding this year to implement its plan, also made
enforcement and hazardous waste reduction proposals.  For copies of the
full plan at no charge, write:  Kentucky DEP Deputy Commissioner Russell

SCIENTISTS CHAMPION PERMEABLE ZEOLITE
AS NEW DETECTOR OF TOXIC MATERIALS

     Recent technological breakthroughs in chemical analysis may lead to a
new era of inexpensive, high-speed monitoring of ground water, waste sites
and work places for toxic substances.  Researchers from the University of
New Mexico and the Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., are
developing new chemical sensors using zeolite, a porous mineral that can
act as a "molecular sieve."

     Using polymers, the zeolite crystals can be arranged so that they act
as highly selective chemical screens, said Thomas Bein, assistant chemistry
profes?sor at the University of New Mexico and a member of the research
team.  These "screens" will allow only a single type of molecule to be
absorbed.  "The concept is very, very general and can be applied to almost
all chemicals," he said.

     Acoustic wave sensors located underneath a thin coating of the
zeolites may enable detection of substances up to the parts-per-billion
level.  This information then would be transmitted to a central control
station without removing the sensor, Bein added.

     This method of chemical monitoring has several advantages, Bein
explained.  Perhaps most importantly, it may allow for continuous and
"almost instantaneous" monitoring that could provide early warnings of
pollution.  It also may eliminate the need for human involvement in
collecting toxic samples.

     The new technology has not yet been tested in the environment.  But
the research team will be working on experimental testing devices aimed at
monitoring halogenated hydrocarbons leaking from waste dumps, Bein said.
The research group hopes to test a number of different zeolites and develop
a data bank about the different sensors.  The project is sponsored by an
Energy Department program that encourages cooperation between New Mexico
academic institutions and the two national laboratories in the state.  The
National Science Foundation provided funding for the sensor project, which
started about 30 months ago, Bein added.

     The research group's findings were presented Dec. 18 in a paper,
"Molecular Sieve Sensors for Selective Operation at the Nanogram Level," at
the 1989 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies in
Honolulu.  For more information, contact Bein at 505/277-4935 or the
American Chemical Society at 202/872-4600.

FISHER SEES IMPORTANT ROLE FOR
INTERNATIONAL CHEMICAL TESTING

     A recent international agreement to test 150 industrial chemicals won
praise as an "interesting and important development in chemical testing and
con-trol" from Linda Fisher, the Environmental Protection Agency's
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances.

     She cited this pact, under which member nations of the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed to
determine the chemicals' adverse effects by 1994, as one of her three
priorities for administering the Toxic Substances Control Act.  (For
details on the OECD agreement, see TMN, Nov. 22, 1989).  The others
are pollution prevention, which is being pushed across-the-board by
Administrator William Reilly, and developing a strategic plan for the
Office of Toxic Substances.

     "My [overall] priority is to take advantage of those three activities
to target, perhaps, some new approaches to TSCA -- to build on what's going
on in the international community, to take a look at how we can use TSCA to
bring about pollution prevention or better management of chemicals, and to
use the strategic plans," she told TMN in a Dec. 15 interview.

     EPA also is "looking at an initiative under [TSCA] Section 8(e) to
identify ... in industries' minds more clearly their responsibility under
that section to report to us adverse effect findings in their [chemical]
studies," Fisher said, although she provided no timetable for a possible
proposal.

EPA TO ASSESS PCB CONTAMINATION
IN HUDSON RIVER, AGENCY SAYS

     Environmental Protection Agency officials in New York City have
released plans to re-evaluate the pollution on the bottom of the Hudson
River by polychlorinated biphenyl wastes from two General Electric Corp.
plants.  The agency's Region 2 said there would be a "reassessment of
whether further cleanup activities should now appropriately be taken under
the Superfund program."

     The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has been
using a demonstration program involving the dredging of the PCB sediments
from the river and capping them in an aboveground landfill with a $20
million federal grant under the Clean Water Act.

     "EPA has decided to reassess the 1984 decision in light of additional
data developed by New York state with respect to the movement and
persistence of the PCBs in the sediments, and in recognition of recent
advances in PCB-destruction technologies such as incineration," the agency
said.  "EPA's reassessment will be carried out independently of the DEC
[capping] plan."

     But $17 million of the grant will be redirected to support New York's
wastewater treatment programs due to delays in building a landfill for the
river sediment.  "The [state] project has not moved forward as planned
because of difficulties in siting the landfill," said EPA.

     PCB wastes were released into the river in 1973 by two GE facilities
in Fort Edward, N.Y.  In 1984, EPA signed a Superfund "record of decision"
that postponed the removal of PCB-contaminated sediment from the river
bottom.  A cleanup plan calls for PCBs on the river bank to be capped in
place temporarily.

STUDY FINDS LINGERING POLLUTION
IN MIDWEST FARM-STATE STREAMS

     Toxic herbicides were found in more than half of 155 Midwestern
streams tested early last spring, the time of year when contamination
levels should be lowest, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) study showed.

     Although fields had not been treated since the previous growing year,
55 percent of the streams tested in 10 farm states still had measurable
levels of herbicides such as atrazine and alachlor, both widely used on
corn and soybeans to control weeds.  A second round of sampling conducted
in May and June -- after fresh applications of herbicides -- found 90
percent of the streams had detect-able contamination and dozens of samples
exceeded federal health advisory standards for such residues.

     Donald Goolsby, lead study author and USGS's water quality specialist
for the central United States, said his sampling team expected to find some
contamination, but not as mush as they did.  "The surprise was the large
and widespread concentrations," he explained.  "These herbicides have been
detected before in streams in agricultural states, but we do not know of
any reports of the wide-spread occurrences found in our study."

     Agricultural chemicals should be at their lowest concentrations in the
environment in the spring, Goolsby said, speculating that the springtime
contamination may be the result of streams tapping ground water
reservoirs, where herbicide residues can persist for six months or longer.
Another explanation, he observed last week, might be related to the general
drought conditions in the Midwest over the past few years.

     "It's possible there has not been sufficient rainfall to flush them
[herbicides] from the fields," he said.  The stream contamination "could
be coming from the previous year's application."

     The study tested streams in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.  Those
states were chosen because they account for 60 percent of all pesticide use
in the country and produce 75 percent of the nation's corn and 60 percent
of its soybeans.

     The second round of stream testing, conducted after springtime field
spraying, found dozens of samples had concentrations of herbicide residues
above federal health advisory levels.  Of the 127 samples, 71 exceeded the
Environmental Protection Agency's health advisory level for atrazine and 44
were higher than EPA's proposed drinking water standard for alachlor.  EPA
has classified alachlor as a probable human carcinogen and atrazine as a
possible human carcinogen (Canada has banned alachlor).  The geological
survey's study was not designed to test drinking water, Goolsby noted,
although some of the sampling sites were up-stream of public water intakes.

     In addition to its unprecedented scope, the study was innovative
because it used a new enzyme-based immunoassay method for detecting
herbicide residues in water, Goolsby said.  The new method is much faster
and cheaper than the traditional gas chromotography detection technique,
and, if verified as accurate, could have a major impact on environmental
science, he said.  The immunoassay method has been used primarily in
medical research.  The USGS study team currently is analyzing a third
round of water samples collected in the late fall, when water flow
generally is lowest and streams are being fed largely by ground water.
Results from this round of testing are due this month.

BOOK DETAILS ISSUES OF
DISASTROUS AIR TOXICS RELEASES

     Noyes Data Corp. of Park Ridge, New Jersey, has published a manual
called Accidental Releases of Air Toxics that compiles "the technical
information that is necessary for developing approaches to preventing and
controlling accidental releases."  The 649-page volume offers a brief
history of toxic chemical re?leases, an overview of the accidental release
problem, methods commonly used in hazard identification and evaluation, and
a summary of the general principles of hazard control.

     The book, written by six analysts from the Radian Corp. of Austin,
Texas, also identifies primary industrial chemicals of concern and
discusses fundamental causes of toxic releases.

     A major section of the manual addresses "prevention technologies,"
with chapters on process design considerations, physical plant design
considerations, and protection technologies such as flares, scrubbers, and
enclosures.  A section on "mitigation measures" features reports on
emergency planning and training, facility layout, detection systems, vapor
dispersion modeling, meteorological instrumentation, and secondary
containment.

     "Costs of identification, evaluation, inspection, and control
technologies can be used to roughly estimate costs of various programs for
accidental release prevention and control by either regulatory agencies or
companies," the authors state in a chapter entitled "Cost Implications for
Policy Planning." The book presents data and methodologies "to provide
companies with a rough measure of cost impacts of various process control
options."

     Accidental Releases of Air Toxics is available from Noyes
Publications, Mill Road at Grand Ave., Park Ridge, N.J. 07656.  The cost is
$86.

COURT ORDERS TRIPLE DAMAGES
FOR CLEANUP OF PCB WASTES

     A North Carolina man and his son have been ordered by a federal judge
to pay the federal government three times its costs of cleaning up
polychlorinated biphenyl wastes at a Fayetteville site.

     The Environmental Protection Agency spent $268,000 from Superfund to
remove PCB wastes from a former transformer reclamation site owned by Dewey
Strother of Fayetteville.  A federal district court has ordered Strother
and his son Kenneth to pay $804,000 under Section 107 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

     In addition, the Strothers must pay a fine of $78,000, or three times
the $26,000 civil penalty assessed against them in 1984 for violating the
Toxic Substances Control Act.  The two men also must reimburse the
government three times all future cleanup costs at the site and three times
the government's legal costs, the Justice Department said.

STATE COURT THROWS OUT N.Y. RULE
ON POSTED PESTICIDE WARNINGS

     A controversial New York regulation that would require farms, hotels,
offices, residential buildings and restaurants to post notices before and
after pesticide use was rejected Dec. 21 by the Appellate Division of the
New York State Supreme Court.  Several groups representing the affected
industries sued the state over the proposed rule.

     The rule could not go into effect because the state Department of
Environmental Conservation had not not fully assessed the environmental
impact of the regulation, as required by law, the court said.  The court
also ruled that the DEC did not file the regulations on time.  Under the
decision, the department may have to repeat the public hearing process for
the regulation.

     State officials have not yet decided whether to appeal the decision to
New York's highest court, said R.W. Groneman, a DEC spokesman.  DEC did not
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the rule because state
officials felt it would "have little or no adverse effect on the
environment."

     Agriculture groups, however, said the posting of signs might impede
farmers from using integrated pest management (IPM), which relies on the
quick and judicious use of chemicals.  Since the final version of the rules
would require only four hours' notice, instead of the 24-hour notice
originally proposed, DEC does not feel the law would impeded IPM, Groneman
said.

     But the court agreed with the farm groups.  "While it is true that DEC
may have considered the IPM program in promulgating the regulations, the
evidence in the record decisively demonstrates that the regulations would
have a major adverse impact on the IPM program, that DEC knew of this
evidence and that, therefore, an EIS was required to explore the entire
issue thoroughly," Justice Norman Harvey wrote in his opinion for the court
(his emphasis).

     DEC continues to support the concept behind the regulations, which
would require commercial establishments and farms to post notices informing
the public a few hours before pesticides are used and keep the notices
posted up to a full day after they are applied, Groneman said.  "The public
has a right to know about these dangerous chemicals that are, quite
frankly, used to kill things," he said, adding that this information can
mean "life or death" to allergic individuals.  Hotel and restaurant groups
had argued the signs would discourage business, but the state maintains the
public would quickly become acclimated to the notices, Groneman added.

THE UNITED STATES indicted 101 corporations and individuals for
environmental crimes in 1989, the Justice Department said last week.  This
is a slight decline in the number of indictments obtained in the previous
two years, however.  There were 127 indictments in 1987 and 124 in 1988,
the department said.  Government prosecutors negotiated guilty pleas or won
convictions in 107 cases.  The convictions and pleas resulted in individual
defendants being sentenced to a total of 37 years in prison.  The courts
assessed fines totaling $13 million.  The government has obtained
convictions or guilty pleas against 127 corporations and 305 individuals
since 1983.  The individuals have been sentenced to a total of 270 years in
prison, the department said.  It assessed criminal fines of more than $26
million since 1983, the first full year of operations for the Justice
Department's environmental crimes section.

     *  New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection fined a
Middletown company $4.1 million allegedly for violating its discharge
permit hun?dreds of times.  Engineered Precision Casting Co. (EPC)
discharged improperly treated wastewater into a creek 210 times, exceeding
its permit limits for iron, lead, cyanide, chromium and acute toxicity,
charged state environmental Commissioner Christopher Daggett.  The
company's 1985 permit required it to build a waste-water treat?ment
facility, but the firm failed "to construct a ... plant capable of meeting
permit limits or to direct its discharge" to the local sewerage plant, said
Eric Evenson, the department's acting director of water resources.  The
department had referred the allegations to the state's attorney general,
whose interest led EPC to start releasing the most toxic portion of its
waste stream into a mobile storage tank for disposal at a permitted
facility.  But the temporary measure was not enough to head off the
fine -- the second largest ever im?posed by the department.  EPC may request
an administrative hearing.

     *  Occidental Chemical Corp. and Chemical Land Holdings Inc., both
Dallas-based firms, have agreed to spend at least $10 mil?lion for a
cleanup of dioxin contamination in Newark, N.J.  The state's Depart?ment of
Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Ag?ency
regard them as responsible parties for the dioxin and other pollutants
re?leased during pesticide production at the site.  Diamond Alkali, which
eventually merged with Occidental, produced pesticides, including the
herbicide Agent Orange, at the "Ironbound" site from 1951 to 1969.
Chemical Land Holdings now owns the property.  The settlement, filed in
Newark's federal dis?trict court, requires the firms to fund containment
measures to keep the dioxin from polluting the Passaic River.  Once the
government approves a method for cleaning up dioxin (neither the state nor
the federal government yet has done so), the firms will have to pay for
full remediation.

     *  The Washington Department of Labor and Industry has increased the
training time the state will require for hazardous waste workers.  The
rules, effective June 1, will require of workers at least 80 hours of
off-site instruction and three days of field training under direction of a
trained supervisor.  Federal law re?quires 40 hours of off-site training,
plus three days of field experience.  "Fly-by-night contractors who employ
workers without proper training are a reason so many Superfund sites
exist," said Harold Avery, director of the North?west Laborers and Employers
Training Association.  The group lobbied for a tougher training standard.
The department's order also sets up "site work" zones barring untrained
workers.

     *  Texas Water Commission staff have proposed fining a Houston
specialty chemical producer, ArChem, $119,600 for alleged violations of
state and federal hazardous waste regulations.  TWC staff allege the
company:  failed to determine whether wastes stored at its plant were
hazardous; stored wastes longer than 90 days; and illegally discharged
wastes from the plant.  The proposed fine, the largest ever for a
Houston-area firm, must be approved by Texas' water commissioners.  The
proposed penalty also would require ArChem to test for soil contamination.

     *  Cleveland State University has received $107,555 to expand its
hazardous materials training program for industrial personnel, firefighters
and other emergency responders.  The money is the first installment of
funds collected under the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's
registration fee schedule for hazardous materials transporters.  The Ohio
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, enacted in 1988, requires
transporters to register shipments of toxic materials.  Half of the funds
generated are earmarked for CSU's training program.  For more information,

     *  The Council of State Governments (CSG) has developed "model state
legislation" for reducing the generation of hazardous wastes.  Components
of the legislation include:  establishing treatment and disposal fees and
gra?duated taxes on hazardous waste; exempting recycled waste products from
sales taxes; mandating audits of waste and waste-reduction; requiring
proof of waste audits from in-state and out-of-state industries before
allowing their wastes to be treated or disposed; and providing help with,
but not prescribing, waste reduction technologies.  To develop the model
legislation, CSG formed a task force of state legislators, legislative
staff and environmental regulators.  Sources for CSG's proposal include:
existing and proposed state bills; National Governors Associ-ation
workshops; the Office of Technology Assessment; and the Conference on
Alternative State and Local Policies.  Copies of the legislation are
available from:  CSG, Center for the Environment and Natural Resources,
P.O. Box 11910, Lexing?ton, KY 40578.

22 that made the government the sole claimant for victims of the 1984
Bhopal gas leak, a ruling that confirms an out-of-court settlement between
India and Union Carbide Corp.  Lawyers representing gas victims had
challenged the validity of the settlement, arguing that it denied claimants
their constitutional right to sue the Connecticut-based multinational
company for the disaster.  The Indian government and the company settled
Feb. 14, with Union Carbide paying $470 million in exchange for an end to
all civil and criminal proceedings (TMN, Feb. 15, 1989).  The focus
now shifts from litigation to distribution of the settlement money.  Some
500,000 people have filed claims, although many of these are believed to be
false.

     *  Zinc Corp. of America agreed to pay a $614,000 fine to settle
allegations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that the
company's Palmerton, Pa., metal extracting operations violated OSHA's lead
standard and other safety and health requirements.  Under the agreement
reached last month, the company and the United Steelworkers of America
jointly will conduct a training program on lead hazards for all management
and hourly employees, OSHA said.  The  union will select a physician to
review the medical records of employees who may have been exposed to lead.
The company also must consult and cooperate with the union in revising the
Palmerton plant's respirator program, work practices and engineering
controls to address issues raised in the citations.  The agreement includes
these allegedly "willful" violations:  over-exposures to lead; improper
respirator selections; lack of engineering controls for lead; defective
lead medical monitoring and removal programs; and failure to provide
protective clothing.  The company must correct cited violations by June 30.
OSHA defines a willful violation "as one in which an employer either knew
that a condition constituted a violation or was aware that a hazardous
condition existed and made no reasonable effort to correct it."  OSHA
originally proposed fining Zinc Corp.  $1.9 million last March for 295
alleged willful violations of the lead standard.
