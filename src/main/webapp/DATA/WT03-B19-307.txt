<P>
The CRC for Food Industry Innovation was established in 1993 with strong industry participation and focus. Although based primarily in Sydney, the CRC has an important research node within the CSIRO Division of Food Science and Technology in Victoria. The centre aims to provide a co-ordinated research and development base for the new generation of improved and novel natural food ingredients, primarily in the field of micro-organisms.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Expertise within the CRC covers natural microbial gene transfer and general gene technology, microbial physiology and ecology, fermentation scale-up to 100 litres and beyond, downstream processing, and evaluation of food ingredient efficacy and functionality. Some R&D projects with major potential for commercialisation include:
<UL>
<LI>improving strains of lactic acid bacteria for use in the production of fermented dairy products;
<LI>improvements to baker’s yeast and production of novel food ingredients from yeast biomass;
<LI>development of gut micro-organisms that contribute to health and wellbeing (probiotics);
<LI>studies on food spoilage and the identification of pathogens;
<LI>evaluation of the production of flavours, enzymes, colours and other functional ingredients for use in foods;
<LI>procedures for minimising post-harvest spoilage are being evaluated.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Successes will strengthen the food industry's position in existing markets and may result in the development of natural products for which there is a large world-wide demand.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
A CRC node was established in Victoria to take advantage of the expertise and strengths in dairy technology and probiotics of the CSIRO Division of Food Science and Technology in Melbourne. The Victorian research team works closely with scientists in New South Wales and South Australia in the development of probiotics and functional foods.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Undergraduate, Masters (Research and Formal) and PhD programs are available in defined research areas at the University of New South Wales. Short courses and symposia are run which target selected areas of the food industry.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC  encourages companies to join it in the development of research projects that are mutually beneficial.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Total contributions (cash and in-kind) to the Centre will be more than $33 million over seven years.
