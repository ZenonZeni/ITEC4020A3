<b><i>READINGS AND RESOURCES ABOUT READING INSTRUCTION FOR
YOUNG CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES (E540bib)</b></i><P>

July 1996<p>   

<b><i>Adams, M. J. (1990). Beginning to read: Thinking and learning about print. The 
MIT Press, 55 Hayward St., Cambridge, MA 02142.  494pp.</b></i><br>
    Drawing on an array of research on the nature and development of reading 
proficiency, this book argues that educators need not remain trapped in the 
phonics versus teaching-for-meaning dilemma and offers instructional 
alternatives.  The book proposes that phonics can work together with the 
whole-language approach to reading and provides an integrated treatment of the 
knowledge and processes involved in skillful reading, the issues surrounding 
their acquisition, and the implications for reading instruction.  The book 
stresses the importance of preschool language and literacy experiences and 
includes descriptions of those that will best prepare children for reading 
instruction. <P>

<b><i>Blachman, B. A. (1991).  Early intervention for children's reading problems: 
Clinical applications of the research in phonological awareness.  Topics in 
Language Disorders, 12(1), 51-65.  UMI*</b></i><br>
    This article reviews research on training phonological awareness in 
kindergarten and first-grade children and describes research-based intervention 
and assessment activities applicable to classroom and clinical settings.  
Intervention applications include categorization activities, phoneme 
segmentation, and metalinguistic games. <p>

<b><i>Brady, S. et al. (1994). Training phonological awareness: A study with 
inner-city kindergarten children. Annals of Dyslexia, 44, 26-59. UMI*</b></i><br>
   Inner-city kindergarten children (n=24) were given an 18-week phonological 
awareness training program, that incorporated auditory and articulatory 
techniques for fostering metaphonological development.  Compared to controls, 
subjects had greater gains in phonological awareness at the end of kindergarten 
and had a trend toward better reading skills in first grade.<P>

<b><i>Cunningham, P. M., & Allington, R. L. (1991).  Words, letters, sounds, and big 
books: A beary good approach.  Learning, 20(2), 91-92, 94-95. UMI*</b></i><br>
   Describes how primary teachers can use decoding strategies within a 
literature-based, whole-language setting.  A three-stage approach involves the 
book stage (real reading), the word stage (learning words), and the letter-sound
stage (learning sounds).  The article provides sample activities. <P>

<b><i>Curtin, J. (1993).  The effectiveness of the reading recovery program on reading
achievement.  (ED363863) 12p. ERIC Document Reproduction Service
(EDRS)**</b></i><br>
   A study examined the effect of the Reading Recovery program on the reading 
achievement of first-grade students.  Subjects, 60 third-grade students in a 
Chicago public school with 97% Hispanic and 3% White student population, 
completed the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills.  Test scores for the 30 students who 
were tutored using Reading Recovery lessons in first grade were compared to the 
scores of the 30 students who were not tutored.  Results indicated that the 
students tutored in Reading Recovery did not obtain significantly different 
reading achievement gains compared to those students who received only classroom
instruction.  Findings affirm the goals of the Reading Recovery program, which 
are to assist the lowest reading achievers in first grade to reach the median of
their class and to maintain the rate of gain.<P>

<b><i>Dudley, Marling C. (1989).  The role of parents in children's literacy 
development: Collaborating with parents of exceptional children. Pointer, 33(4),
16-19.  Heldref Publications, 1319 18th St. NW, Washington, DC  20036-1802. 
</b></i><br>
   This paper discusses several strategies for promoting literacy, which 
teachers can share with parents of exceptional children who are having 
difficulty learning to read and write.  Strategies include: reading aloud to 
children, modeling reading behavior, writing to and with children, and 
responding to children's reading and writing. <P>

<b><i>Dyck, N. J. (1991).  Phonological awareness for reading success.  Beyond 
Behavior, 2(1),  24.  The Council for Exceptional Children, 1920 Association 
Drive, Reston, VA 22091-1589. </b></i><br>
     Noting recent research studies identifying phonological awareness ability 
in kindergarten as a powerful predictor of reading success, this article offers 
specific suggestions for developing phonological awareness.<P>

<b><i>Foster, K. C. (1994).  Computer administered instruction in phonological 
awareness: Evaluation of the DaisyQuest program.  Journal of Research & 
Development in Education, 27(2), 26-37.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   DaisyQuest is a computer program that teaches and provides practice in 
synthetic and analytic phonological skills.  Researchers found young children 
trained on DaisyQuest had significantly greater phonological awareness gains 
than children without training.  Children trained on a more developed version 
significantly outperformed a matched group on three phonological awareness 
measures. <P>

kids
at home and in school. Walker & Company, 435 Hudson St., New York, NY 10014. 
171pp.</b></i><br>
   Intended for use with youngsters eager to begin reading as well as reluctant 
starters, this book is filled with time-tested, entertaining, and simple games 
that build on children's curiosity and sense of fun to teach reading skills.  
This book contains a brief introduction outlining the methods and goals of the 
reading games and instructions on how to play over 30 games.  Games  are based 
on proved favorites such as "Go Fish," "Bingo," "Lotto," and "Concentration." <P>

<b><i>Groff, P. (1991). Teachers' opinions of the whole-language approach to reading 
instruction.  Annals of Dyslexia, 41, 83-95.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   First-grade and second-grade teachers (N=275) were surveyed concerning their 
knowledge about and attitudes toward the whole-language approach to reading 
instruction.  Findings suggest that many teachers are not persuaded that the 
whole language approach is to be preferred over other methods such as intensive 
phonics instruction or basal reading instruction.   <P>

<b><i>Hall, E. A. (1991).  An examination of the process of teaching reading to 
learning disabled children: Vygotskian perspectives. Paper presented at the 
Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (Chicago, IL, 
Apr. 3-7, 1991). (ED336894). ERIC Document Reproduction Service
(EDRS)**</b></i><br>
    The process of teaching reading to 12 second- and third-grade 
learning-disabled children was investigated in mainstream classrooms and 
resource rooms.  The study focused on how the process of achieving 
intersubjectivity in a routine task like reading takes place and how the 
construction of intersubjectivity (referred to as scaffolding) can vary as a 
result of the teacher norms being brought to the task.  Transcripts of 
teacher-child interaction were coded according to Vygotskian principles.  
Resource teachers were found to apply these principles more consistently than 
mainstream teachers.  As a result, resource teachers had longer interactions 
with children in which they made more adjustments that catered to a reader's 
zone of proximal development.  Students in resource rooms were also more likely 
to have successful reading episodes and were more likely to initiate interaction.  It is
concluded that resource room teacher-child interactions were longer because
mainstream teachers persisted in the use of the recitation model  of teaching to a
greater extent than did resource teachers, and because mainstream classroom settings
used a more hierarchical physical arrangement of space and the teacher's position.

phonological-processing deficits in first-grade children at risk for reading 
disabilities.  Journal of Learning Disabilities, 27(10), 647-59.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   Assessment of 486 first-quarter first graders identified 99 children as being
at risk for reading difficulties, half of whom then received a phonological 
processing intervention.  Results support  the early identification of children 
at risk for reading difficulties and the effectiveness of the phonological 
processing intervention.<P>

<b><i>Jenkins, R. (1994).  Facilitating development of preliterate children's 
phonological abilities.  Topics in Language Disorders, 14(2), 26-39.  UMI* </b></i><br>
   This article from a theme issue examines the relationships between emergent 
literacy skills and phonological awareness in preliterate children.  A developmental
model for facilitating literacy development is presented.  Suggestions for enhancing
metaphonological skills and a checklist for the early identification of young at-risk
children are offered.<P>

<b><i>Love, H. D., & Litton, F. W. (1994). Teaching reading to disabled and 
handicapped learners.  Charles C. Thomas, 2600 S. 1st  St., Springfield, IL  
62794-9265.  252pp.</b></i><br>
   This book addresses issues surrounding the teaching of reading skills to 
students who have been diagnosed as having one or more disabilities that affect 
their learning processes.  Various conditions teachers might encounter in 
students are described, and their impact on reading skills is discussed.  
Methods of assessing a student's reading readiness are then discussed, followed 
by a survey of developmental reading methods and materials, including the VAKT 
approach, Corrective Reading, the Rebus Reading Program, Distar, Edmark, 
Orton-Gillingham and Cloze. and other methods. <P>

<b><i>Masland, R. L., & Masland, M. W. (Eds.).  Preschool prevention of reading 
failure. York Press, Inc., 2712 Mt. Carmel Rd., Parkton, MD 21120. 240pp.</b></i><br>
   This book of 11 author-contributed chapters is a product of a symposium concerned
with early recognition and remediation of deficiencies that lead to failure to learn to
read. All papers stress that reading is a linguistic activity with the vast majority of
dyslexia-prone children having a deficiency in basic spoken language skills in the
preschool years. Chapters are organized into sections concerned with prediction of
reading failure, intervention, ongoing studies, and retrospect. <P>

<b><i>Mason, J. M. et al. (1992).  Toward an integrated model of early reading 
development.  Technical Report No. 566.  (ED350595). ERIC Document Reproduction 
Service (EDRS)**</b></i><br>
   A longitudinal study examined the contributions of early language ability, 
home characteristics, and merging knowledge about literacy to children's later 
decoding and comprehension ability.  The study followed 127 children from the 
beginning of kindergarten to the end of grade 3 (when 83 were left).  Subjects 
attended schools in a small, rural, midwestern town or a low-income area of a 
small midwestern city.  Results indicated that: (1) individual differences in 
decoding ability have little effect on children's reading comprehension, and 
vice versa; (2) early language understanding predicts reading comprehension; (3)
emerging knowledge about reading predicts subsequent decoding ability; (4) 
children's early interest in and involvement in literacy predicts gains in 
reading and (5) home problems had a negative prediction on reading.  Findings 
suggest support for integrating cognitive processing models, developmental 
models, and social constructivist models. <P>

<b><i>Morrison, D. et al. (1988).  Screening for reading problems: The utility of 
SEARCH. Annals of Dyslexia, 38, 181-92pp.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   The accuracy of SEARCH, a screening instrument for identifying children at 
risk for developing learning disabilities, was evaluated with 1107 kindergarten 
children.  Children identified as at risk were of average intelligence.  SEARCH 
scores were significantly correlated with sequential and simultaneous information
processing skills.  SEARCH predicted adequacy of preacademic reading
skills with 77% accuracy. <P>

<b><i>O'Connor, R. E. (1993).  Teaching phonological awareness to young children
with learning disabilities.  Exceptional Children, 59(6), 532-46pp.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   Forty-seven children (ages 4-6) with language impairments were assigned to 
receive training in one of three categories of phonological tasks (rhyming, blending, and
segmenting) or a control group.  Subjects made significant progress in each
experimental category, but demonstrated little or no generalization within a category or
between categories.<P>

<b><i>Palardy, J. M. (1991).  Four "teachable" reading readiness skills.  Reading 
Improvement, 28(1), 57-60pp.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   Reviews selected instrctional procedures in the four reading readiness skills that can
be taught and learned: auditory discrimination, auditory comprehension, visual
discrimination, and visual  memory.  Stresses that readiness skills are requisite to
reading skills. <P>

<b><i>Palincsar, A. S., & Klenk, L. (1992).  Fostering literacy learning in supportive
contexts.  Journal of Learning Disabilities, 25(4), 211-25pp.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   This paper focuses on enhancement of literacy skills of young children with 
learning disabilities, through intentional learning, reciprocal teaching, and 
redefining the contexts of early literacy learning.  Research results show that 
children benefit from strategy instruction occurring within classroom cultures 
that support collaborative discourse, flexible application of comprehension 
strategies, and meaningful literacy opportunities. <P>
     
<b><i>Pressley, M., & Rankin, J. (1994).  More about whole language methods of
reading instruction for students at risk for early reading failure.  Learning 
Disabilities Research & Practice, 9(3), 157-68.   UMI*</b></i><br>
   This literature review contends that whole-language approaches to reading are
not well supported by scientific analyses of reading and reading instruction.  
The paper argues that whole language is not the preferred approach of 
outstanding primary and special education teachers, who favor instruction that 
balances decoding instruction and development of meaning-making competencies. <P>

<b><i>Reutzel, D. R., & Fawson, P. (1991).  Literature webbing predictable books: A 
prediction strategy that helps below-average, first-grade readers.  Reading 
Research and Instruction, 30 (4), 20-30pp.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   Examines the effect of using a literature webbing strategy lesson and 
predictable books with 22 below-average first-grade readers.  This article finds
that the literature webbing strategy lesson was significantly more helpful in 
improving below-average readers' comprehension as measured by miscues in oral 
reading and answers to comprehension questions than was a directed 
listening/reading thinking approach. <P>

<b><i>Ross, S. M. et al. (1994).  Using "Success for All" to restructure elementary 
schools: A tale of four cities.  (ED373456) ERIC Document Reproduction Service 
(EDRS)**</b></i><br>
   The Success for All (SFA) program was designed as a K-3 preventive and 
intensive intervention for students at risk of failing to learn to read for the 
purpose of bringing every student to grade level in reading by third grade.  Key
program elements include individualized tutoring, regrouping across grades into 
homogeneous reading classes, smaller reading classes, family support, and a 
comprehensive reading program.  This paper presents findings of a study that 
examined the effects of the SFA program on student reading achievement in four 
cities. Specifically, the study sought to assess student achievement when the 
SFA program is introduced in settings geographically removed from program 
developers.  A comparison of individual reading test results with those of 
matched control groups indicated advantages at three of the sites, with 
particular advantages for the lowest-achieving 25 percent of students relative 
to their control counterparts at all four sites.  Results also indicate that the
SFA program can be replicated at distant locations with limited monitoring by 
program developers.   <P>

<b><i>Sawyer, D. J. & Butler, K. (1991).  Early language intervention: A deterrent to 
reading disability.  Annals of Dyslexia, 41, 55-79. UMI*</b></i><br>
   This paper discusses five language roots of reading: phonology, syntax, 
semantics, short-term and long-term memory, and auditory segmenting.  Teachers 
are urged to focus early school experiences toward development of these five 
skills to reduce the incidence or reading difficulties.  Specific teaching suggestions are
offered.<P>

<b><i>Sears, S., & Keogh, B. (1993). Predicting reading performance using the 
Slingerland Procedures.  Annals of Dyslexia, 43, 78-89pp.  UMI*</b></i><br>
   Longitudinal data from 104 children administered the Slingerland Procedures 
in kindergarten and achievement tests in later grades found significant 
relationships between Slingerland measures and reading outcomes, with prediction
varying across grades and according to the reading measure used.  Listening 
contributed to reading comprehension but not to word recognition, and visual 
skills influenced early reading performance.   <P>
  
<b><i>Sheffield, B. B. (1991).  The structured flexibility of Orton-Gillingham.  
Annals of Dyslexia, 41, 41-54. UMI* </b></i><br>
   This paper discusses a philosophic basis for Orton-Gillingham teaching and 
demonstrates how features such as multisensory teaching can remediate language 
problems exhibited by many dyslexic students.  Commonalities and differences 
among the Orton and Gillingham variations are examined. <P>

   This article describes the Reading Strategies Program, which teaches decoding
skills to primary-level students with learning disabilities with a methodology 
intended to teach children to apply the skills to literature.  Cognitive 
strategies also are used to apply comprehension skills to the material and to 
write about the material read.<P>

<b><i>Torgesen, J. K. (1994).  Longitudinal studies of phonological processing and

   A longitudinal (from kindergarten through grade 2) study with 244 children 
evaluated three hypotheses regarding the causal relationship between 
phonological processing abilities and reading acquisition.  The study found a 
bidirectional relationship between phonological processing skills and reading 
skills and stability in individual phonological processing abilities over time. <P>

   This collection of  papers was written to address two purposes: (a) to provide
teachers in preservice LD preparation programs with an overview of validated practices
that have been proven effective for children with language learning disabilities, and  (b)
to provide regular education teachers preparing to enter the field or already in the
classroom with knowledge about validated teaching strategies so that they can work
more effectively in collaboration with an LD consultant.    <P>
