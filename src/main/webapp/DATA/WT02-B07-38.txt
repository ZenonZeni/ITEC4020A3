<h2>Expanded Protection for Online Transactional Information</h2>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>Ways may some day be developed by which the 
Government, without removing papers from secret drawers, 
can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to 
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.... 
Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against 
such invasions of individual security? 1</blockquote>

<h3>I.	Overview</h3>
<p>
<b>A.	Spirit of ECPA calls for expanded protection for network transactional information</b>
<p>
In the eight years since the enactment of ECPA, society's patterns of using 
electronic communication technology have changed dramatically.  Over twenty million people now have electronic mail addresses, numerous business, nonprofit and political groups conduct work over the Internet, and "cyberspace" has become a household world.  Indeed, it is now commonplace to speak about "life online."  Records of all of these activities -- who sends a message to whom, where a given communications device is located, which political party one contacts for information, and which online discussion group or virtual community one associates with -- are available both in real time and in stored form as part of the transactional information generated by advanced computer and communications networks.  With increasing use of telecommunications, this transactional information reveals almost as much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally followed us around on the street, watching our every move.  
<p>
As the ECPA drafters recognized, "the law must advance with the technology 
to ensure the continued vitality of the Fourth Amendment."2 Under current law, much of this transactional information may be available to law enforcement merely by subpoena which recites that the requested information is "relevant to an ongoing investigation."3 In response to dramatic changes in the way that people use electronic communication services, ECPA should be revised to reflect the increasingly sensitive nature of network transactional information
<p>
<b>B.	Proposal to protect network transactional information that is personally identifiable or that reveals the contents of the communication</b>
<p>	
As this memorandum will demonstrate, the scope and depth of personal, 
sensitive information available through network transactional records has 
increased dramatically since the 1986 law was passed.  Thus, EFF believes that 
the requirements for law enforcement access to certain categories of 
transactional records should be increased from a mere subpoena standard to a 
full "probable cause" warrant requirement.  All transactional records which:
<p><ul>
<li>contain personally identifiable information related to an electronic 
communications, or
<p>
<li>reveal the content of the electronic communication
</ul><p>
should be accessible to law enforcement only with a warrant obtained after 
showing probably cause.
<p>
<p>
<h3>II.	Online transactional information contains extensive personally identifiable information and thus deserves greater protection than telephone toll records</h3>
<p>
<b>A.	Personally identifiable information in online transactional records</b>
<p>
The bulk of email addresses in use today are unique to an individual user.  
Either the address reveals on its face the identity of the user, or a simple 
command can be issued to translate the address into the owner's name.
<p>
<b>Email addresses are personally identifiable</b>
<p>
<pre>jberman@eff.org </pre> belongs to Jerry Berman<br>
<pre>whitfield.diffie@eng.sun.com</pre> belongs to Whitfield Diffie
<p>
Therefore, unlike telephone toll records, a transaction indicating that a message is sent to or received from a particular email address is almost always a definitive record of a communication by an identifiable person.  [For a detailed description of email transactional records, see Appendix A]  Whereas, toll records record only the fact that a given telephone instrument connects an another instrument, a record of an email sent or received will establish the 
identity of the communicating party with some certainty.  Ownership of a 
telephone instruments may be well-established, but without access to the 
content of the telephone communication, there is no proof that any individual was actually using the phone coincident with a communication recorded in toll records.  In practice, courts also agree that toll records fall short of disclosing  identity of the calling parties.4
<p>
Some early email systems tied the email address to a particular computer or 
terminal, just as a  telephone number is tied to a given telephone instrument.  
But today, someone who owns an email address can use it from virtually any 
computer in the world.  Moreover, no one else can easily use another person's email address, since the ability to send and receive mail with an address is generally controlled by password or other security device.  While it is, in some cases, possible to use someone else's email address, this practice will increasingly be considered a fraud on the receiver of the message and a theft of service from the owner of the email account.  By contrast, no fraud is required to use someone else's telephone number, unless one fails to pay the charges associated with the call.
<p>
<b>B.	Transactional records reveal location of sender and recipient</b>
<p>
Transactional information in new mobile communications services such as 
cellular network and Personal Communications Services (PCS) provide law 
enforcement with information about the location and travel of users.  These 
services are designed in order to deliver calls and other communications to the subscriber, no matter where in the country he or she is.  As a side effect of this feature, the network generates trails of transactional information that pinpoint the users location at any time that the user has the device turned on.  For example, when a cellular phone is set to "roam" from one territory to another, it signals the network each time it crosses into a new service area, so that calls can be delivered to that phone and so that proper billing connections are established.
<p>
Furthermore, transactional records from mobile communications services 
will also reveal the movement of an individual from place to place, in real time.  As the target moves from one cell or service area to another, an electronic trace of the fact that a given geographical boundary line is crossed will be created.  If law enforcement has access to such traces, it will be possible to determine not only the targets location, but also his or her direction of movement.
<p>
Such location specific information goes far beyond simple calling and called 
number information contemplated by Congress when it authorized access to 
transactional information without a warrant or other judicial scrutiny.  Where a probable cause warrant has been issued, we do not contest law enforcement's right have access to such information, where technically feasible.  However, we believe that it is contrary to the Fourth Amendment and to the policy framework established in the 1968 Act and ECPA, to allow access to this increasingly rich source of information based on subpoena authority alone.
<p>
<b>C.	Online transactional records deserve a greater degree of protection than telephone toll records</b>
<p>
In contrast to telephone toll records, online transactional information may 
reveal the identity of the communicating parties, and even the precise location of the communicators.  These attributes distinguish online transactional records from traditional telephone toll records and other records generally available to law enforcement under subpoena power.
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.	Content of communication revealed by online transactional 
information</h3>
<p>
In many instances, addressing information from online systems will reveal 
the content or subject of the electronic communication.  As in the example 
below, messages are often directed to, or received from discussion groups on 
particular topics. 
<p>
<b>EMAIL MESSAGE</b>
<pre>
from:       djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner)
to:         eff-crypto@eff.org,whitfield.diffie@sun.eng.com
subject     crypto policy update
date        July 29, 1994, 08:15:48 EST

This week significant progress was made on the Clipper front, but 
slide continues on export control liberalization...
</pre>
<p>
This message would be sent to everyone who is a participant in this particular 
group.  Discussion groups (such as eff-crypto) are similar to telephone 
conference calls, except that they may last for days, weeks, or years.   [See 
Appendix A for discussion of online transactional records logs which reveal 
such information.]
<p>
Here again, email address records are dramatically more revealing than 
analogous telephone toll records.  Telephone toll records might reveal the fact that the user of a particular telephone was connected to a conference call 
service, but would not indicate the subject of that conference.  In the email 
example, above, the subject of the conference is embedded into the address 
line, along with other individual addressed.  Furthermore, since the conference name is indistinguishable from an individual email address, there is no way to segregate such information out of the transactional record stream.
<p>
<b>B.	Freedom of association and assembly implicated by disclosure of personally identifiable information</b>
<p>
Not only does the transactional log of such a discussion group reveal the 
contents of the discussion, but also, the names of the parties to the discussion 
are disclosed in the logs.  This as an excerpt from an actual email log which 
records the progress of the above from the sender to all of the members of the 
online discussion group.
<p>
<pre>
01 7/29  08:15:48	  IIA12559:	from=<djw@eff.org>, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>

04 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	from=owner-eff-crypto, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>
05 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=gnu@toad.com (John Gilmore), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued
06 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=mkapor@kei.com (Mitchell Kapor), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued
07 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=jberman@eff.org (Jerry Berman), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued 
08 7/29  08:15:52	  IIA12565:	to=jseiger@eff.org (Jonah Seiger), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued 
09 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued

</pre>
First, line 1 of the log reveals that a message was sent to the eff-crypto 
discussion group.  Then, lines 5 through 9 reveal the identity of all of the 
recipients of that message, in other words, all of the participants in this particular group.
<p>
For those who associate and assemble online, these email logs are 
equivalent to membership lists deserving of constitutional privacy protection.  Inasmuch as online transactional records reveal the identity of the parties who are engaged in the discussion, fundamental constitutional rights such as freedom of association and freedom of assembly are implicated by any disclosure to the government.  Since NAACP v, Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 US 449 (1958), courts have agreed that threats to privacy of association constitute impermissible intrusion on First Amendment freedom of association and freedom of assembly.  The NAACP case involved a challenge to a government action which would have compelled the NAACP to disclose its membership list to the State of Alabama.  The Supreme Court found that:
<p>
Inviolability of privacy in group association may, in many circumstances, be 
indispensable to preservation of freedom of association.  Id. at 462.
<p>
Inasmuch as online transactional records reveal such group association, they 
should be given a high level of protection from government intrusion.  The 
transactional records of online conferences discussed above and in shown in 
Appendix A, clearly reveal association with particular groups.
<p>
<p>
<h3>IV.	Quantity, Detail, and Ease of Analysis of transactional records require expanded protection</h3>
<p>
With the passage of ECPA , electronic mail messages were given the same 
degree of privacy protection as first class mail.  Notwithstanding the analogy 
drawn in 1986, there are significant differences between email addressing logs 
and information which may be obtained under a mail cover.
<p>
<b>A.	Transactional logs of email contain significantly more information than available from a mail cover</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Automatic email transaction trail
</ul><p>
Email systems create detailed transaction logs as a matter of course, 
whereas the postal service only keeps address logs if specifically required to do 
so by valid legal process.  Thus, in the case of email surveillance, law 
enforcement may decide after the fact of a particular transmission, to seek 
access to transactional records.
<p><ul>
<li>Automatic attachment of return address information</ul>
<p>
When using US Postal Service mail, the addition of a return address which 
identifies the sender is entirely optional and requires an affirmative step by the sender.  In contrast, most email systems automatically append a return address to each electronic mail message, thus guarantying that anyone who examines the email log, will be able to identify both the sender and recipient.
<p>
<ul><li>Email co-mingles functions traditionally accomplished with voice, fax, paper mail, and even face-to-face communications</ul>
<p>
Email communication is often a substitute for many other forms of 
communications.  An email message can replace a fax, a voice telephone call, 
a short note sent through the US mail, and even face-to-face communication.  
Therefore access to logs of such communication is vastly more revealing than a log of any other single form of communication.  Courts have recognized an 
increased privacy interest in co-mingled information as compared to the same information in disaggregated form.
<p>
<b>B.	Increased privacy interest in compilations</b>
<p>
The volume and detailed nature of email transactions raise much more 
serious privacy concerns than do either toll records or mail cover logs.  The 
Supreme Court and the US Congress have recognized that computerized 
compilations of information raise unique privacy concerns.  Beginning with the Privacy Act of 1974, Congress has acknowledged that "computerized data 
banks ... present issues considerably more difficult than, and certainly very 
different from, a case involving the source records themselves."5  Later, in 
Whalen v. Roe, the Supreme Court found that "[t]he central storage and easy 
accessibility of computerized data vastly increase the potential for abuse of that information."6  And finally, in US Department of Justice v. Reporter's Committee, the Court found that a "strong privacy interest inheres in the nondisclosure of compiled computerized information...."7   It is precisely the great volume of and easy access to transactional information which raises an increased privacy interest in these records.
<p>
<h3>V.	Extend the spirit of ECPA to cyberspace:  Need to update ECPA protections for transactional information in the changing digital world</h3>
<p>
The guiding principle of ECPA was that new privacy protection should be 
extended to electronic communications, so that user of new communications 
technology would have confidence that their communications were free from 
unwarranted private or government intrusion.  With the qualitative shift in 
communications activity that has occurred over the last decade, it is time to 
extend greater protection to the transactional information that records people 
activities online.
<p>
<b>A.	Gaps left by 1986 law -- Unclear definition of transactional records</b>
<p>
The main focus of ECPA was to offer clear privacy protection for the contents 
of electronic communication despite the fact that the communication is handed over to a third party, namely the electronic communication serviceprovider.8   However, little consideration was given at the time to the proper treatment of transactional records.  The records are mentioned in the statute, but not given any definition.  The committee report from the Senate does offer brief discussion of the nature of these records, but focuses primarily on customer lists and telephone toll records.9   The House report recognizes that electronic communications services create records that do not conform to legal categories for older technologies:
<p>
The newer technologies such as electronic mail and remote computing 
services maintain a type of records which do not neatly fit within the legal 
categories which exist for older technologies.10
<p>
However, no where in either committee report is the issue of access to email 
transactional records discussed  for the purposes of establishing the 
appropriate standard for government access.
<p>
<b>B.	Extension of protection is consistent with the spirit of ECPA and the expressed intend of the drafters</b>
<p>
In the spirit of ECPA, we should recognize that it is again time to extend 
privacy protection to the personally identifiable transactional information that is, in may cases, indistinguishable from content.11  The drafters did not intend that electronic communication service providers should not disclose "profiles" of users that were related to the contents of the communication.12  Furthermore, discussions of transactional records was limited at the time to telephone toll records and other customer account billing and demographic information.13
<p>
<p>
<h3>VI. Conclusion</h3>
<p>
This memo has shown that:
<p><ul>
<li>transactional records now reveal the content of communication,
<li>these records contain personally identifiable information,
<li>disclosure of such records implicate fundamental privacy and free 
association rights,
<li>current law is unclear as to the definition of such records, and,
<li>increased protection for transactional records is consistent with the spirit of the 1968 Act and the 1986 Act.
</ul><p>
Attached is proposed statutory language which would amend the stored 
communications section of ECPA to provide a higher level of protection for 
sensitive transactional records.  The amendments would leave intact law 
enforcement's current authority regarding telephone toll records and basic 
billing information such as subscriber billing address and service 
arrangements.  These changes to current law are necessary to provide 
assurances to users of new communication technology that their private 
activities in the online world are free from unwarranted interference.

<h3>Telephone Toll Records and Electronic Mail Logs</h3>
<p>
<p>
The most significant difference between a telephone toll record and an 
electronic mail log is that electronic mail addresses are unique to individual 
users.  Unlike a telephone number, which corresponds only to a specific 
location (such as a home or business address), most electronic mail addresses 
are linked by a secret and unique password14 to an individual regardless of 
physical location.  Thus, while a record indicating that a certain telephone 
number was dialed from another telephone number indicates that a transaction occured, an electronic mail record indicates that a specific and unique individual has communicated with another individual or group of individuals.
<p>
<b>Telephone Toll Records</b>

<p>
These records indicate the date, number dialed, its location, time, and duration of calls made from 202 483-5429, which is billed to Jonah Seiger. These records do not indicate that Jonah Seiger himself actually placed the calls, the identity of the recipients, or the nature of the communication (i.e, voice, modem, fax, etc).
<p>
<b>Electronic Mail Logs </b>
<p>
The table below represents actual electronic mail logs from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's electronic mail server.  These logs indicate a message sent by an individual user (in this case, djw@eff.org) to members of an online discussion titled (eff-crypto) (EFF's online forum on issues relating tocryptography and digital privacy in general).  Although this example contains addresses unique to EFF, virtually all electronic mail software logs transactions in an identical way.  In the course of accounting and processing electronic mail messages, the mail server assigns each message a unique message ID number.  By tracking a message ID number, one can 
easily know who sent a message, and to whom that message was sent. (For ease of reading, line numbers have been added).
<p>

The table above follows a message sent by <djw@eff.org> to the recipients of 
the (eff-crypto) mailing list.  Line 01 indicates that message IIA12559 was sent 
by (djw@eff.org).  Line 03 indicates that that message was sent to the address 
(eff-crypto).  In line 04, indicates that message IIA12559 was sent from (eff-
crypto) as message IIA12565.  Lines 05 through 09 indicate that message 
IIA12565 was sent to specific individual recipients of the (eff-crypto) list.
<p>
<b>Comparison of Telephone Toll Records and Electronic Mail Logs</b>
<p>
From these two examples, it is clear that electronic mail logs reveal a great 
deal more about both the destination and substance of a communication than 
does a telephone toll record.  While the telephone toll record does show that a specific number was dialed at a certain time, it reveals nothing else about the nature of the communication, or the identity of the sender or the recipient. There is nothing inherent in a toll record to indicate that a specific individual communicated with another.  In the example above, we only know that 202 483-4529 dialed 313 555-4545 on a certain date and time.
<p>
In contrast, because each electronic mail address is linked directly to an 
individual with a password unique to that address, a record of a communication in this medium indicates the occurrence of a communication between two specific individuals.  Moreover, in the example above, the log reveals that an individual communicated with a group of individuals who belong to a subject specific group (in this case eff-crypto).  Through a simple analysis of message identification numbers, one can very easily track the communications of one person, and know with certainty with whom that person is communicating.

<h3>File Transfer and Retrieval Logs</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b>Tracing a File Directly to an Individual</b>
<p>
Virtually all online information services, such as America On Line (AOL), 
Prodigy, Compuserve, and the Internet, contain a wealth of files and information in areas known as "file archives".  There are many thousands of archives throughout cyberspace, containing files ranging from political information (e.g.: White House press releases, legislation, policy statements, etc.), shareware (free, public domain software), to images from the Hubble Space Telescope.  Users can access file archives through a variety of ways depending on the service they subscribe to.   
<p>
For purposes of maintenance, accounting and security, most online services 
keep records of all transactions involving file transfer and retrieval.  Through a simple analysis of these records, one can easily trace a file directly to an 
individual user.
<p>
The example to follow will illustrate how such a trace can be accomplished 
using transactional records from the Internet File Transfer Protocol (ftp), the 
primary method for transferring and retrieving files over the Internet.  FTP 
provides any Internet user with the ability to retrieve files from any computer on the network.   Files available via ftp are stored in 'ftp archives' which can be accessed by a user through the execution of a few relatively simple commands. <B>[EDITORS NOTE: This document was originally written in July 1994, before the explosion of the World Wide Web. File transfers over the World Wide web are essentially the same as FTP transfers, raising the same issues identified here].</B> 
<p>
Every user on online networks is identified by an electronic identity, usually identical to their electronic mail (email) addresses.  Individuals control access to their email addresses through a secret personal password.  Because email 
addresses are tied to individual users, and because ftp logs indicate that a 
specific file has been retrieved, a simple analysis of ftp logs can easily reveal 
that an individual has retrieved a specific file.
<p>
<b>FTP Transaction logs</b>
<p>
This example will trace an individual user's retrieval of a file from the online 
archives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).  The file, named 
'digitel.faq', contains answers to frequently asked questions about the Digital 
Telephony legislation.   The records below are actual records from EFF's ftp 
archive (named <b>ftp.eff.org</b>) and main computer (<b>eff.org</b>)
<p>
All computers connected to the Internet have names.  In this example, it is 
important to note that <b>ftp.eff.org</b> and <b>eff.org</b> are two distinct computers.  The computer <b>ftp.eff.org</b> keeps separate records from the computer <b>eff.org</b>.  Furthermore, each authorized user has a unique electronic identity, usually same as that individual's electronic mail address (e.g.: brown@eff.org is the user Dan Brown [EFF's system administrator]).  A simple correlation of the timestamps on the transactions between the two computers will reveal that Dan Brown retrieved the file 'digitel.faq'. 
<p>
<p>
<h3>I.	Dan Brown Logs Onto <b>eff.org</b></h3>
<p.
By examining the logs of the computer eff.org, we can determine when a 
specific individual logged onto and off of the network.  This record is displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
#  User  Terminal	  Remote machine	Timestamps

05 brown   ttyp0	  elec.eff.org	Fri Jul 29 12:59:04 - 13:03:14 

</pre>
Because the user 'brown' is linked to Dan Brown through a unique personal 
password, this record indicates that Dan Brown was logged onto <b>eff.org</b> on Friday July 29 between 12:59 and 13:03.
<p>
<h3>II.	Dan Brown Executes a File Transfer (ftp)</h3>
<p>
By examining the logs which record the programs run by users on <b>eff.org</b>, and noting the times at which those programs were run, we can determine when Dan Brown executed a file retrieval program (ftp).   This record is displayed below (printed on July 29 at 13:15):
<p>
<pre>
#  program   user name	  terminal	  start time   	end time

08 ftp	   brown	  ttyp0	  13:00:21	      13:01:20

</pre>
Note that the start and end times correspond to the period of time Dan was 
logged onto <b>eff.org</b>.  This record clearly shows that Dan Brown ran the file retrieval program (ftp) between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20.
<p>
<h3>III.	Logs from the File Archive Show a File Transfer </h3>
<p>
We now turn our analysis to the records of the computer containing EFF's 
online file archives (the computer named <b>ftp.eff.org</b>).  Again, a simple check of timestamps reveals that a user from <b>eff.org</b> made a connection using the file transfer program (ftp).  These records are displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
#  Timestamp	  Hostname	   Process ID	Message
		
04 Jul 29 13:00:21  ftp.eff.org  in.ftpd[5458]: connect from brown@eff.org
	
12 Jul 29 13:01:20  ftp.eff.org  ftpd[5458]:    FTP session closed

</pre>
Note the direct correlation between the times indicated above and the times 
indicated on the previous two logs.  This log shows that the file transfer program run by Dan Brown was executed on the computer <b>ftp.eff.org</b>, indicating that Dan Brown retrieved a file from EFF's online file archive.  
<p>
<h3>IV.  Logs from the File Archive Name the File Transferred to Dan 
Brown</h3>
<p>
One final check of the logs from EFF's online archive show which file Dan 
transferred to his own computer.  We already know that Dan was logged onto 
the network between 12:59:03 and 13:03:14.  We also know that he ran the file 
transfer program between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20.  This has been confirmed by 
logs from two separate computers.  By examining one additional log on the 
computer containing EFF's online file archive (<b>ftp.eff.org</b>), we can see which particular file Dan retrieved.  This log is displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
Fri Jul 29 13:01:18 1994 1  				

eff.org	67773  /pub/EFF/Policy/Digital_Telephony/digitel.faq

</pre>
This log shows that the file 'digitel.faq' was retrieved at 13:01:18 by a user 
logged onto the computer <b>eff.org</b>.  Note that the exact time of the file retrieval corresponds to the time that Dan Brown was running the file retrieval program (as indicated on the logs described previously).
<p>
We have seen that Dan Brown was running the file retrieval program 
between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20.  This is confirmed on the logs from both the 
computer Dan was logged onto (<b>eff.org</b>) as well as the computer containing the online file archive (<b>ftp.eff.org</b>).  Because the logs also show that the only user running the file transfer program at that time was Dan Brown, we have now confirmed that Dan Brown retrieved the file 'digitel.faq'.

<b>FTP Logs Reveal the Actions of an Individual User and the 
Contents of those Transactions</b>
<p>
Detailed transactional information from online information services enables 
anyone with access to these records to reconstruct a detailed picture of a user's 
actions.  In this case, the logs show which document the user accessed. 
Because all users on the Internet and other online services are linked to their 
electronic identities by a unique password, transactional records which reveal 
the electronic identity of a user correspond directly with that individual.  The 
electronic identity (brown@eff.org) is always Dan Brown.  In the case of this 
example, transactional records reveal that Dan retrieved the file 'digitel.faq' 
from the online archives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<p>
Transactions similar to the one illustrated here occur millions of times each 
day on computer networks throughout the United States.  Furthermore, because computer logs record each and every transaction, it is not difficult to track the actions of any individual using an online service simply by examining such logs.  
<p>
This type of detailed transactional information is not unique to Internet ftp 
sessions.  It is captured in similar forms on computers throughout the online 
service world.  Every time a user logs on to an online service, sends electronic 
mail, retrieves a file, or joins a discussion group, detailed information is 
collected in the normal course of completing these transactions.  And, since 
virtually all users of online services are personally linked to their electronic 
identities by a unique password, all of these transactional records point directly to the actions of individual people.

3 18 USC 2703(d).  As will be discussed below, the statutory distinction between contents and records is unclear, so that current scope of law enforcement access is not a matter of settled law.<p>
4 In United States v. Anderson (542 F.2d 428, 1976), the 7th Circuit found that "toll records could not be relied on to show the contents of calls nor the parties thereto; ... identification of places called ... did not reveal the identity of the recipient or the nature of the call..."<p>

8  "A letter sent by first class mail is afforded a high level of protection against 
unauthorized opening by a combination of constitutional provisions, case law.... But there are no comparable Federal statutory standards to protect the privacy and security of  communications transmitted by new noncommon carrier communications services or new forms of computer technology.  This is so even though American citizens and businesses are using these forms of technology in lieu of, or side-by-side with, first class mail and common carrier telephone services."  ECPA Senate report, p5.<p>
9  "Subsection (c) provides for access to records or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of an electronic communications or remote computing service, not including the contents of electronic communications.  This section permits the provider of the service to divulge, in the normal course of business, such information as customer lists and payments to anyone except a Government agency.  It should be noted 
that the information involved is information about the customer's use of the service not the contents of the customer's communication." ECPA Senate Report, p. 38<p>
10  House Report, p. 26<p>
11 Curiously, the original language in Title III, before it was amended by ECPA, provided that the "contents" of a communication included the "identity of the parties to such communication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of the communication."  Thus, in 1968, telephone toll records were accessible under a lower standard precisely because they did not reveal the identity of communicating parties or the existence of the communication.  Any transactional information which reveals the 
identity of the parties, or the content of the communication, should therefore be accessible to law enforcement only through a probably cause warrant. <p>
12  ECPA House Report, p.64<p>
13 "The type of records involved are billing records and telephone toll records 
(including record of long distance numbers and message unit information."  ECPA House Report, p. 69.<p>
14 All commercial on line services (AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc), as well as most Internet providers require users to enter a password each time they log onto the service.  Passwords are unique to each individual (similar to a PIN number used for cash machines at Banks), and in most cases the practice of using another persons password without permission is considered a breach of contract or user agreement. <p>

15 The dialed numbers have been changed .  The information described above has been certified by Bell Atlantic to be identical to information obtainable by law enforcement officers with proper subpoena authorization.  Records indicate long distance toll calls.  According to Bell Atlantic, only long distance dialed number records are collected.  Law enforcement must use pen register or trap and trace devices to capture local dialed number records.<p>
