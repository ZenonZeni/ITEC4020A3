BANKERS TO PLUCK FRUITS OF INVESTMENT PRODUCT MARKET

      At a record rate, banks are overstepping traditional
boundaries and offering mutual funds and other investment
products to their customers.  The euphoria of finding new sources
of fee income is certainly contagious.
      But to successfully ride this ever-strengthening wave and
maximize profits, banks need to look beyond the immediate bottom

securities marketplace.  We welcome your comments, so please feel

      First of all, the nature of the consumer market is changing,
with a large portion of the population moving from being savers
to investors, "in part driven by low rates, in part driven by the
fact that baby boomers are inflation-conscious and investment-
driven," said Ed Furash, a Washington, D.C., bank consultant.
This group is searching for yield and isn't content with current
savings account and certificate of deposit (CD) earnings.
      Banks, in turn, are stuck with a big distribution system and
the need to increase fee income to offset their shrinking net
interest margins. "At the same time, banks don't have a lot of
loans to make--the demand and quality aren't there," he said.
      Banks have to stop the drain on deposits caused by plunging
interest rates.  "In the battle between banks and non-banks, it's
essential banks enter non-bank products such as annuities and
insurance.  If not, non-bank competitors will steal banks blind,"
Furash said.
      An illustration of the strength fee income can generate is
St. Louis-based Mark Twain Bancshares, which recently reported a
37.94 percent increase in 1992 earnings over 1991.  The bank
attributes its strong performance in part to its revenues from
its fee-based divisions (bond, brokerage, mortgage and trust),
which grew a collective 30.01 percent in 1992 compared to 1991.

   You Can Jump in All at Once or Dip in a Toe at a Time

      Some banks are taking bold steps in their commitment to
investment products. A prime example is NationsBank Corp.'s
partnership created this fall with Dean Witter Financial Services
Group Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.  The two
subsidiaries each own 50 percent of the new firm, called Nations
Securities, a Dean Witter/NationsBank Co., headquartered in
Charlotte, N.C.  The company is an independent securities
brokerage firm and has about 400 investment officers now working
at selected NationsBank banking centers around the country.
      Another tactic is to set up a separate bank subsidiary, then
hire outside investment professionals.  First Chicago Corp.'s
bankers call customers before a CD is about to mature.  Customers
disappointed by the new CD rates available are referred to
nonbanker investment professionals; mutual fund sales have
tripled.
      Other banks are cautious about the investment product wave's
future, or don't have the time or money for new product
development.  But banks can still profit from rent and fee income
generated from investment firms sharing branch space.  Another
strategy is to take advantage of third-party processors that, to
varying degrees, help banks sell investment products.

   Don't Expect a Magic Carpet Ride

      Unfortunately, investment products aren't a guaranteed magic
carpet ride to profitability.  Successfully marketing investment
products requires a lot of planning, including developing a
marketing plan that focuses on customers' needs; after all,
investment product managers shouldn't try to sell a high-growth
stock fund to a 90-year-old woman.
      The mutual fund industry may now have more than $1.67
trillion in assets, but so far bank proprietary funds have relied
mainly on converting existing assets rather than acquiring new
customers, said Kenneth Hoffman, president of the Optima Group
Inc., a Connecticut-based marketing consulting firm that
specializes in helping banks market mutual funds.
      The majority of bank proprietary mutual fund growth is
coming from the cannibalization of existing assets, he noted; to
change that trend, banks must put on their marketing hats.
When asked what pitfalls to avoid, Furash fired off this list:

Improperly explaining the product, including giving full and
complete disclosure of the risks;  Offering funds that are
attractive to the bank, not the customer; Trying to sell a stock
or fund without understanding what the customer wants; Confusing
the customer by selling too many options.  Most people want three
or four different options, plus some advice on allocation; Not
offering the right mix of options; Failure to perform due
diligence, investigating mutual fund vendors.
Many more potential traps probably lie ahead, so go cautiously.

   Market Ripe for the Taking

   Market Ripe for the Taking

      Despite snares, industry analysts are predicting that bank
investment products will be successful.  Baby boomers' propensity
to invest will be coupled with the fact that banks can use their
existing distribution system and their image to cash in on this
growing market.  Banks have a traditionally more trustworthy
reputation than non-banking institutions, said Furash.

   Bank of America Funds Show Strong Growth

      Bank of America is an example of a bank reaping big rewards.
Its Pacific Horizon Mutual Funds grew by 83 percent last year, as
opposed to the entire mutual fund industry's growth of 23
percent.  The nine funds had $12.2 billion in average assets
under management in 1992, compared with $6.6 billion in 1991.
      The growth of new assets in 1992 was principally due to
institutional clients--banks trust departments and Fortune 500
companies--that chose mutual funds over direct instruments, said
Debra McGinty-Poteet, senior vice president and manager of mutual
funds for Bank of America.
      Other reasons are low interest rates that make funds more
attractive to investors and marketing and sales efforts by
Concord Financial Group Inc. (the distributor) and the
relationship managers at Bank of America Funds Management, said
McGinty-Poteet.  Bank of America's and Security Pacific National
Bank's April 1992 merger also resulted in the convergence of
several funds.
      Bank of America NT&SA is the investment adviser to the
Pacific Horizon Funds.  Concord Holding Corp., a proprietary bank
mutual fund administrator, administers the Pacific Horizon funds;
its subsidiary, Concord Financial Group Inc., is the sponsor and
underwriter and distributor.
      Here are some tips from Hoffman on how to make mutual funds
and other investment products tempting enough to keep existing
deposits as well as attract new customers--and their money.

      1.  Give investment products the marketing efforts they deserve.
Banks aren't placing a priority on marketing funds, and "many
banks have attempted to pass marketing responsibility over to
their distributors without effectively communicating their
expectations," said Hoffman.  According to a survey performed by
Optima, 17 percent of senior fund managers reported that no
dollars were committed to mutual fund marketing, while 28 percent
didn't know what percentage of operating expenses went to funds
marketing.
       Optima Group discovered in its survey that banks with a
marketing plan are twice as likely to view their fund product as
"very successful," yet more than one-half of the banks surveyed,
with proprietary funds, had no developed marketing plan.
      The best approach is to cultivate a joint marketing plan
with the distributor, said Hoffman; that is done by about 36
percent of the banks with a marketing plan.  Another 29 percent
did one in-house, while 36 percent left marketing to the
distributor.
      Banks also err by not properly allocating advertising
dollars.  "The strategy that works well for Fidelity and Vanguard
is unlikely to work for your bank for two fundamental reasons:
First, customers of the mutual fund companies are unlikely to
switch; second, the mutual fund companies will always outspend
you," he said, adding that the large mutual fund companies can
spend more than $100 in advertising and marketing for every new
customer they acquire.

      2.  Avoid turf wars.  Retail bankers are used to thinking of
trust departments as handling clients with tax, estate and
investment management concerns.  In turn, trust departments view
brokers as people poised to steal the best customers, and view
retail customers as unprofitable.
      The choice is "to rely exclusively on converted assets and
let your departments squabble over control of the marketing of
the mutual funds or to develop a consistent, well thought-out
marketing plan that commits a significant portion of bank
resources to capitalize on the immense potential of mutual
funds," said Hoffman.

      3.  Capitalize on Competitive Advantages.  One of those
advantages is customer access, including information from
databases, branches and loan applications.
      "Frequent contact with customers provides a tremendous
opportunity to cross-sell existing customers into mutual funds.
This is an advantage which brokerage firms, insurance companies
and other financial competitors do not have.  At a bank,
customers literally 'come to you,'" Hoffman said.

      4.  Focus on customers with the greatest promise.  Carefully
analyze available data, including DDA dollar velocity, CD
balances, credit card balances, credit lines and savings
balances.  Doing so separates the investors from the savers.
      DDA dollar velocity, the amount of money a customer puts
into his checking account each month, can be a prime indicator of
customer income.
      Combined with other research such as car buying habits and
residence location, the resulting market segmentation can be used
for mailings and telemarketing, Hoffman said.  Its effectiveness
in using it to market investment products can then be tested and
refined.
      "This data on purchase behavior is critical," said Hoffman.
"Banks should take pains to update it, nurture it and make it an
operable part of future marketing efforts.

      5.  Divide and conquer, then offer something extra.  Divide
potential customers into three groups:  the traditional mutual
fund retail customer, the affluent and the high-end trust
customer.  Retail customers traditionally don't understand the
difference between stocks and bonds.  But they could become a
lucrative market if those products are explained properly.
      The high-end investors need more services, such as trust
services and portfolio rebalancing.
      Customers that fall in the middle may require a relationship
manager; they often need more service than the traditional retail
customer but don't possess the assets of a trust customer, said
Hoffman.

      6.  Offer brokers incentives.  Instead of worrying that the
brokers will take away the largest customers, bankers need to
focus on strengthening those relationships.  Besides offering
monetary incentives, bankers can give brokers access to customer
data and sales support.  Separate customer statements for the
funds are attractive, as are prospectus wraps with strong sales
messages, dedicated wholesaler telephone support, service support
and cross-sale programs to encourage customers to commit
additional dollars to the fund.

BANKS AGAINST NON-BANKS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS

      Despite the hard knocks banks have taken in the recent past,
commercial bank trust departments have come out winners over the
past 10 years when it comes to equity investments.
      In fact, over the past decade banks have outperformed mutual
funds, insurance companies and investment advisors in equity
funds under management, according to an annual study conducted by
CDA Investment Technologies Inc., an independent investment
performance measurement service.
      The Rockville, Md.-based company also found that banks
reaped higher equity returns than insurance companies and mutual
funds over the last three- and five-year periods.
      Fixed income returns also fared well, with banks remaining
competitive with those experienced by mutual fund and insurance
companies over the last three-, five- and 10-year periods.

   Bank Trust Departments Produce Returns as Good as Non-Banks

      The survey results are evidence that bank trust departments
are holding their own and producing good investment returns for
their clients.
      "Not only do the absolute returns compare favorably to our
major competitors, but bank-managed portfolios have exhibited
more consistent results under varying market conditions, a
reflection of lower risk profiles," said Henry Gooss, managing
director and chief investment officer of Chemical Bank.
      For the one-, three-, and five-year periods, investment
advisors achieved the highest annualized rate of return in
equities, but banks edged them out over the last 10-year period.
      The chart below summarizes the study's findings for the one-
, three-, five- and 10-year period ended Dec. 31, 1992:

ANNUALIZED RATE OF RETURN ON EQUITIES

                      1-Yr      3-Yr      5-Yr    10-Yr

Banks                  8.7%    11.3%      15.7%   15.6%
Mutual Funds           8.5%    10.0%      14.0%   13.5%
Insurance Cos.         7.5%    10.3%      14.9%   15.4%
Investment Advisors    9.3%    11.9%      16.3%   15.3%
S&P's 500              7.6%

      The survey also found that banks have performed consistently
in the fixed-income area against mutual funds and insurance
companies.  Investment advisors were excluded for lack of data.
      For the one-year period, banks, at 6.8 percent, were
slightly behind mutual funds (6.9 percent) and insurance
companies (7.1 percent).  Over the last three years, banks
achieved a 9.8 percent annualized rate of return, ahead of mutual
funds (9.4 percent) and behind insurance companies (10.2
percent).
      Over the five-year period, banks, which achieved a 10-
percent annualized rate of return, were again behind insurance
companies (10.6 percent), but still ahead of mutual funds (9
percent).  This pattern repeated itself over the 10-year period,
with banks reaping 10.6 percent, mutual funds bringing in 10.2
percent and insurance companies achieving 11.3 percent.
      The Rockville, Md.-based research firm based its equity
research on a survey of 1,489 managers, consisting of 217 bank-
pooled funds, 73 separate/variable insurance accounts, 577 mutual
funds and 622 investment advisors, which manage a total of $1.2
trillion in assets.
      For its fixed-income research, CDA surveyed 741 managers,
broken down into 215 bank-pooled funds, 38 separate and variable
insurance accounts and 488 mutual funds, that manage a total of
$316 billion in assets. (For more information, call Jeff Schutes,
CDA, 301/975-9600.)

CHEMICAL TO GET TAX BREAK, NEW BUSINESS IN DUBLIN

      Chemical Banking Corp.'s Geoserve unit has established
operations in Dublin's International Financial Service Center
(IFSC) by acquiring Irish Life's IFSC licenses.
      The bank foresees the move as an opportunity to generate new
business and expand products and services available to existing
and prospective clients, said Jeremiah O'Leary, senior vice
president of Chemical Bank and general manager of the global
securities services division of its Geoserve unit.
      Chemical also chose the IFSC because it's sponsored by the
Irish government and is fully sanctioned by the European
Community.
      "As a result, this location provides access to the entire EC
market and comes with a comprehensive set of tax treaties in
addition to its own favorable tax environment.  Dublin is rapidly
becoming a major center for offshore fund management," O'Leary
said.
      The IFSC was created to encourage the growth of financial
services activities in Ireland; qualifying financial operations
receive special tax incentives to operate within the center; more
than 200 companies currently operate from the IFSC.
      The two licenses acquired from Irish Life will operate as
separate companies under the names Chemical Fund Administrators
Ltd. and Chemical Custody & Trustee Services Ltd.  They will
become part of the Global Securities Services Division (GSS) of
Chemical Bank's Geoserve unit.
      Chemical Fund Administrators, Ltd. will offer fund managers
and promoters administrative and ancillary services relating to
the issue, redemption and conversion of units in collective
investment schemes in accordance with the directives adopted by
the member states of the European Community.  Chemical Custody
and Trustee Services, Ltd. will act as custodian and/or trustee
on behalf of client fund management companies. Geoserve, Chemical
Bank's global wholesale services arm, provides cash management,
funds transfer, securities processing, corporate trust and trade
services to corporations and financial institutions.  Its annual
revenues exceed $700 million. Global Securities Services provides
domestic and global custody, dealer and broker clearance,
securities lending and master trust services. Chemical has been a
frontrunner in using cutting edge technology to offer global
trust and custody services.  Last year, its ChemTrust system went
live in New York and Europe, fully integrating worldwide
reporting and accounting on one platform.  The system allows
clients to view the status of their global and domestic holdings
in real-time on one integrated report.

MUTUAL FUNDS, INVESTMENT ADVISER ARE BILLS TO WATCH

      Two bills germane to selling mutual funds are in front of
Congress this session: The Financial Services Act of 1993 and the
Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act of
1993.
      The Financial Services Act (H.R. 458), introduced by Rep.
Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.) in January, would expand bankers' ability
to engage in full mutual fund activities by permitting bank
subsidiaries and affiliates to underwrite and distribute mutual
funds. Mutual funds represent a significant market for bankers.
Approximately 120 banks now offer over 675 proprietary mutual
funds; total assets are an estimated $25 billion.  But under
current law, banks must use a middleman instead of having full
control over sponsorship and distribution of their own products.
      Banks are only permitted to serve as investments advisers,
custodians, transfer agents and fund administrators.
      National banks, their subsidiaries and bank holding company
subsidiaries are also allowed to both broker and recommend
securities of investment companies for which they serve as
investment advisors.

   Act Would Give Bankers More Freedom

      The act would give bankers the freedom to sponsor,
distribute and underwrite mutual fund shares--eliminating the
need to involve a third-party provider. Also, management
interlocks between a bank or bank holding company and the mutual
fund subsidiary would be permissible.  The act would also require
one-time disclosures to be made to customers regarding, among
other things, the lack of FDIC insurance for these investment
products.
      This bill has seen no action yet.  It was first introduced
in the closing hours of the last session, mainly for purposes of
discussion.  Keep an eye out.

   The Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act

      This bill (H.R. 578), introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-
Va.) in January, would amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
an act criticized by industry players for having no teeth.
      The bill proposes to rectify the deficiency by providing
enhanced supervision and regulation of investment advisers by
providing for:

       Higher registration fees (initial and yearly) for
investment advisers to fund more SEC inspections and surveys of
unregistered advisers; More frequent SEC examination of high risk
advisers;  A record-keeping requirement to verify suitability;
SEC authority to designate a self-regulatory organization to
conduct investment adviser examinations; Enhanced disclosure
through brochures containing general information, advance
transactional reports revealing commissions and third-party
payments, and periodic reports of all charges; Client assets;
Disqualification from being an investment adviser for a felony
conviction; Confidentiality with respect to personally
identifiable information unless consent is given.

      Because the bill doesn't propose any change in the
definition of investment adviser, it wouldn't apply to banks or
their trust departments as they are currently exempt from the
definition.  It would, however, have an impact on banks that have
established separate subsidiaries.
      This act was also introduced last session and passed
committees in both the House and Senate, but differences couldn't
be worked out before the recess. Testimony has already begun this
session, and further action is expected.
