<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Candida or Depression?
<BR>Stay Open to All the Factors in Healing
</CENTER></H2>

I've always been interested in the multifactorial nature of illness. This means illness has
multiple causes. Ideally the doctor should use  a multifactorial approach in treating it. I'm
uncomfortable with the term &quot;holistic&quot; because it's become a political term, so I prefer
ecologic, by which I mean looking at all the aspects of the inner person and their outer
world-the whole system of relationships. It's essential to know the unique characteristics of
your patient.


<P>Based on a symptom, you don't necessarily know the cause; usually many factors contribute to
the onset of illness. These can include genetics; emotional state; functional, structural,
psychological, and nutritional conditions; the presence of  toxic environmental pollutants;
endocrine, immune, and musculoskeletal system status; the effect of the climate
(biometeorology); and the effect of the landscape (geopathic stress). The clinician needs to
be open and receptive to the fact that there are multiple influences acting upon the patient.
Don't look for one simple answer.


<P>In mainstream medicine there is too much emphasis on the classification of disorders. It
tries to pigeonhole a patient into tight categories so a single specialist can work on the
problem. The trouble is they'll often pursue things in the wrong direction if they follow
only one lead. The same symptom can have many causes, but you don't get this perspective when
you do a pigeon-hole diagnosis. Let me explain with a case.


<P>A nurse in her forties came to see me complaining she was depressed and  spontaneously crying
all the time. She was convinced her problem was candidiasis, or yeast overgrowth. She knew
this is common in women of her age group, that crying is part of the syndrome, so she assumed
she probably had it.


<P>Evaluating her, I felt she didn't meet any  clinical criteria for yeast overgrowth, but she
did have a psychological history showing strong reasons for why she might be depressed. I
suggested her condition was fundamentally a depressive state unrelated to yeast overgrowth.
In addition to psychotherapy and medications, several natural substances help depression,
such as the amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and L-methionine, plus hypericin, from the
herb, St. John's Wort.


<P>Conversely, women have seen me because of depression-I am, after all, a psychiatrist by
training-thinking they needed psychotherapy or medication. Yet after I evaluated them, I
found their depression was actually caused by yeast overgrowth. In this case, I would
immediately get them off refined sugars, yeasts, and molds, fortify them with megavitamins
and mineral supplements, and perhaps prescribe caprylic acid and acidophilus.


<P>It is just as important for the patient not to start off with the conviction that she knows
the cause of her illness and simply seek out somebody who's going to reinforce that
conviction. People often do that. In these two examples you can see how one person looked to
me as a candida specialist, while the other saw me as a psychiatrist. Patients are also
seduced by single-factor diagnosis just like most allopathic doctors, forgetting that illness
can have many causes.


<P>Let's look at depression. Depression can result from the failure of a body system or it can
be a psychological defense, protecting the person from material they don't want to deal with,
or it can be a warning sign that something is going to collapse in terms of their mindbody
balance. It can also be based on bodily toxicity or allergic sensitivity and reactivity to
environmental substances.


<P>A very pleasant, calm woman came to see me. She brought her knitting in with her and sat
there smiling, knitting away, as I tested her for allergies. I gave her a particular antigen
and she became depressed almost instantly. She stopped knitting and started crying. After I
neutralized the effect of the antigen, she told me that if my office had windows that opened,
she would have jumped. She couldn't even express to me how suicidal she had been feeling.


<P>Evaluation is half the picture, but treatment is the other. This should also be understood as
being multifactorial.  Treatments should be selected on the basis of 6 factors: safety, cost,
efficacy, speed, availability, and patient preference. Most allopathic health professionals
don't think in terms of these 6 factors. The decision about what to do should be a working
alliance between the physician and the patient. I believe the physician's job is to educate
the patient. Together, doctor and patient make the decisions in line with the patient's
preferences and the physician's knowledge of the best outcomes.


<P>Healing is the key word here. Healing, in part, means restoring the patient to a state of
health; yet there's more to it than that. There should be a growth aspect from experiencing
illness and restoring health.


<P>When you're dealing with illness, it's not simply a matter of returning to a past state of
health. I encourage patients to see it as an opportunity to move forward to a higher level of
wellness. I've encouraged many patients to view their psychiatric hospital experience as an
opportunity to arrive at a more advanced place in themselves; with great insights from having
worked through their pain.
My advice to patients is this: look for a health practitioner who is open and knowledgeable
about a broad variety of treatments-and be sure to stay that way yourself.
