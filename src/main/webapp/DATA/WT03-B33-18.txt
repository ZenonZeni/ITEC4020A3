TRENDS IN BRIEF...

THE TREND TOWARD OUTSOURCING MAY TURN INTO A NETWORK
management headache.  When large customers pass the wide
area networking buck to carriers, they lose the ability
to monitor and test the complete net, pointed out Scott
Magee, a SystemView for AIX consultant.  IBM and other
companies need to work closely with the carriers to
ensure that their management systems stay useful...
IBM's many write-offs for restructuring and other costs
may be bad for investors, Wood Struthers Vice Chairman
Stanley Nabi told The Wall Street Journal.  Nabi said
IBM's book value is lower than it was 12 years ago...
Viking Components yesterday released memory upgrades for
IBM ThinkPads.  The modules come in 4M, 8M, and 16M and
are priced from $60 to $75 per megabyte.

NOTES 4 THE NEW YEAR

Lotus Development Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.) is poised to
hail in Notes Release 4 along with the new year.  Many
industry observers said Lotus' timing is well-aimed to
beat out its primary competition: Microsoft Exchange,
scheduled for general availability in February.  Other
analysts pointed out that Lotus' more more mature
product, Notes Release 4, already has a running start
against Microsoft Exchange Version 1 Release 1.

Notes 4 promises greater functionality and ease of use
over Notes 3.  Calling it the convergence of messaging
and groupware, Lotus outlined the benefits of its fourth-
generation product:

* Object store: Documents and objects can be stored,
managed, and retrieved through links or direct user
manipulation.  The object store does not distinguish
between messages and other objects.

* Security: Additional security beyond password security
and digital signatures is rolled into Notes 4.  Further
security is required to manage access to the object
store, as well as to the individual objects and fields
within that database.

* Mobile support: Notes 4 users will have access to
messages, as well as to objects that have been linked to
those messages.  Notes 4 supports database replication
directly to individual client laptops and remote
desktops.

* Manageability: Manageability requirements are expanded
to include replication.  The client/server architecture
of the integrated messaging and groupware requires that
fourth generation systems provide robust tools for the
centralized management of servers, messages, and object
stores, as well as routers and server tasks.

* Directories: Notes 4 extends the directory to encompass
configuration, authentication/security, and customized
site-specific information.

* Transport and routing: These services are expanded to
transport and route loosely structured documents that
typify fourth generation objects.  Also, Notes 4 has
native support for X.400 and SMTP-MIME transports to
ensure interoperability with international inter-
enterprise communication standards.  Message and document
routing are dynamic, with routing paths that are
alterable on the basis of message urgency to link
availability.

* Migration facilities: Notes 4 migration facilities
allow system administrators and users to migrate at their
own pace and support coexistence among multiple
generations of messaging systems.

ABOUT FACE FOR INTERFACE

Across the board, analysts were most impressed with Notes
4's new and improved interface.  Lotus completely
redesigned its interface, explained Mark Levitt, senior
analyst for electronic messaging for International Data
Corp. (Framingham, Mass.).  "It connects cc:Mail to Notes
through a shared interface," he said.  "As a mail-based
interface, it makes it much easier for cc:Mail users to
use Notes."

The interface is the most important aspect of Notes 4,
Levitt said.  "Notes has always had a great deal of
functionality that has gone unrecognized or unused by
most users," he said.  "Not all users need that amount
of functionality, but the interface makes it simpler and
easier for cc:Mail users to move to Notes.

"Notes 4 goes several steps beyond what cc:Mail is
today," Levitt continued.  "That is not to say that Lotus
is planning to get rid of cc:Mail, but they're making the
migration path to Notes easier."

Vince Carahaly, president of NetExperts Inc. (Exton,
Penn.) and beta customer of Notes 4 on Windows NT for a
month and a half, agreed that the interface was a key
improvement in Notes 4.

"The biggest complaint about Notes 3 was that the e-mail
interface wasn't very good -- even though this was the
company with the award-winning cc:Mail product," Carahaly
said.  "With Notes 4, Lotus gave the e-mail interface the
look and feel of cc:Mail."

Apart from the new interface, Notes 4 improved its
database replication.  Notes 4 supports field-level
replication, while Notes 3 only supported document-level
or record-level replication, Carahaly explained.

For example, a Notes user can have a personnel file with
all the information on an employee and perhaps a bitmap
with a photo ID of the person.  With record-level
replication, if one part of that file changes -- for
instance, the employee's phone number -- the Notes user
must replicate the whole thing.  At field level, the user
can get in and change the phone number.  "It's much more
granular," he said.  "It's more efficient, faster, and
there's less data to ship over."

RELEASE 4 VERSUS RELEASE 1

Even without the one month head start over Microsoft,
Lotus is still in a better position with Notes 4 than
Microsoft is with Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.
"Notes is an established product.  It's a mature
generation of product -- that's their head start right
off the bat," he said.

In addition, Notes 4 is a more robust environment than
Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.  "Microsoft Exchange
is not workflow -- it's just client/server mail," he
said.  "Notes is a workflow product with client/server
mail."

"Shops that have Notes probably won't switch to Microsoft
Exchange," Carahaly said.  "Many companies are waiting
to see how good Notes 4 actually is.  Once it gets into
the market and people find that it has no problems, does
what it says it does, the improvements are there and
functioning -- it will be a hit."

Another analyst agreed that Notes 4 is a large
improvement over Notes 3.  "Notes 4 is a great leap
forward," said Tom Austin, research director with the
Gartner Group (Stamford, Conn.).  "Notes 4 put in place
a real integrated development environment."

Austin also praised the new mail interface.  "Notes 4 has
brought management of communications to the point where
mere mortals can do it," he said.  In addition, Notes 4
has improvements in scalability.  "With Notes 4, a server
can support five to ten times more people versus Notes
3," he said.  "This greatly reduces the cost of
management."

JAVA JOCKEYING

Notes 4 contains the programming language Lotus Script.
"Lotus Script obsoletes Notes macros," Austin said.
Despite the recent announcements that both IBM and
Microsoft will support Java and Java Script, Austin said
neither company will abandon their own script languages.
"Java Script won't rule the world," he said.  "But both
IBM and Lotus will support Java."

Although Austin said he was very impressed with Notes 4,
he said the release should have been on the market one
and a half years ago.  "Lotus does not have a track
record for accelerated development," he said.  "Notes 4
came three years after Notes 3.  If it takes Lotus three
more years to come out with Notes 5, it will be looking
at the pack from the back."

IBM PC COMPANY -- PAST AND PRESENT

IBM's PC Company underwent its share of restructuring and
changes in 1995, and most industry observers said its new
direction is a positive step forward.  They also offered
some ideas about what improvements the Big Blue unit can
make in 1996.

KILL OS/2

Analysts shook their heads and wrung their hands over
IBM's continued devotion to its maligned operating
system, OS/2.

"I'm surprised that [IBM Chairman Louis] Gerstner has
allowed OS/2 to continue this long," said Francie
Mendelsohn, president of Summit Research Associates
(Rockville, Md.).  "IBM has thrown millions of dollars
into this and not seen a return."

Although Mendelsohn said OS/2 is an excellent product,
she said the market share is so small that it will not
benefit IBM in any way.  "Maybe 1996 will be the year
that IBM totally gives up the ghost of OS/2," she said.

Another analyst agreed that OS/2 is technologically
brilliant but not worthwhile.  "IBM has to disentangle
itself from ventures like OS/2 because that continues to
drag them into the ground," said Steve Kleynhans, program
director of workgroup computing strategies for the META
Group (Stamford, Conn.).

IBM needs to position itself a leader, Kleynhans said.
"But it's a fine line between surrounding themselves with
new and glorious technology and wandering into the
weeds," he said.  "Lately IBM has been wandering
away -- with things like its Micro Channel and OS/2.
These are things the industry didn't really want -- IBM
needs to do innovative things without alienating
themselves from the industry."

SWIMMING IN THE CHANNEL

Analysts praised the PC Company's move away from direct
selling of its PCs to bringing resellers into the
picture.  "IBM must pursue an indirect channel strategy
to effectively compete in the commoditized PC industry,"
said Joseph Ferlazzo, an analyst with WorkGroup
Technologies (Hampton, N.H.).

Ferlazzo credited Robert Stephenson, the new head of the
PC Company, with the indirect channel strategy.
"Stephenson was probably one of the people who pushed
that through," he said.  "There have been a lot of good
moves since Stephenson's been on board."  As a former
salesman, Stephenson recognizes that IBM can no longer
play in the direct channel and that the company needs to
give its channels enough margin to make it profitable for
them to sell IBM products, he said.

"The big question is: Can IBM provide the necessary
margin to their resellers without losing more money in
the PC Company?" Ferlazzo said.  "It's too early to tell
whether it will work."

Although Ferlazzo said IBM has lived up to its end of the
bargain with its resellers by creating a high presence
for the IBM name in advertising and public relations
activities.  "IBM is doing its job of creating brand
recognition.  Look at all the Aptiva commercials," he
said.

But Kleynhans said the IBM name has lost much of its
luster.  "The IBM name still carries a certain cachet,
but not like it did before," he said.  "IBM's biggest
challenge is to differentiate [itself] in a market where
[it's] no longer the overriding leader."

CLONE THINKPAD SUCCESS

"IBM still makes the best notebook out there with their
ThinkPads," said Mendelsohn.

"IBM needs to find a way to clone its ThinkPad success
for its desktop and server lines," agreed Kleynhans.  IBM
still lacks exciting products in its desktop or server
lines, but this winter the company is poised to introduce
some interesting products, he said.

Mendelsohn praised IBM's move to beef up its Aptiva line.
"Originally it was only a 60 MHz machine -- that's
underpowered even for the home market," she said, adding
that IBM needs to focus more on the home market.  "The
home market will probably account for half of the PCs
sold.  That market is booming."

INVENTORY UNDER CONTROL

At least the PC Company has made strides with its
inventory issues, Ferlazzo said.  "Its build-to-order
strategy is clear and underway," he said.  "Its
manufacturing strategy is strong."

Stephenson's predecessor, Richard Thoman, put in place
a process for daily updates on the amount of orders
received and the number of PCs made, which made
management and inventory issues much easier, Ferlazzo
explained.  "IBM is not having these critical issues of
inventory," he said.  "Manufacturing is no longer a
hindrance."

"The problem is the business model.  The PC Company is
just breaking even, if that," Ferlazzo said.  "The
biggest challenge for Stephenson is making the PC Company
a profitable entity."

IBM'S INET TO SPARK INTERNET APPLICATIONS

Application developers can now "test drive" their
Internet applications in a driving course sponsored by
IBM.  IBM announced an iNet porting extension to its
Solution Partnership Center (SPC) in San Mateo, Calif.

The SPC uses the IBM RS/6000 platform, running IBM's
version of Unix, AIX.  The iNet porting facility provides
developers with access to systems, support, and
tools -- either over the Internet or in person at the
SPC.

"We intend to make the RS/6000 the Internet server of
choice," said Tom Fornoff, director of workstation
marketing for IBM's RS/6000 Division.  "We're confident
that developers using this facility will realize the
advantages in performance and flexibility that the
RS/6000 offers."

INET OFFERINGS

The iNet porting facility's complete list of resources,
free to developers (as available), include:

* An iNet porting World Wide Web (WWW) home page at
http://www.spc.ibm.com that provides information on the
center and how to use its resources

* Internet access to a number of RS/6000 systems running
AIX, allowing developers to test drive the platform and
experience its Internet server capabilities

* Scheduled, secure Internet access to a range of RS/6000
servers, software development tools, and technical
support that let developers port or create Internet
applications for the RS/6000 platform

In addition, developers can use the latest RS/6000
uniprocessor, symmetric multiprocessor, and scalable
POWERparallel systems (RS/6000 SP).  IBM development
tools will also be available.  These include products
from IBM and third parties like BlueStone, Illustra
Information Technologies, Lotus, Netscape, Prodigy,
Progressive Networks, RAD Technologies, Spyglass, VDOnet,
Verity, Worlds, Xing Technology, and others.  These
vendors will also provide technical support and training.

Marketing support is also available for Internet
applications created for or ported to the RS/6000
platform.  Marketing support includes a listing on a "Hot
Internet Applications" Web page directory on the SPC's
home page; marketing links with IBM channels, product
divisions, and the Industry Solution Units.

BOON TO BIG BLUE, DEVELOPERS

Industry observers were excited about IBM's announcement
and said the iNet porting facility is a boon to both IBM
and developers.  "This allows IBM to immediately allow
developers to begin testing code, testing new market
ideas -- without building an infrastructure of corner
stores," said Rich Doherty, a director of The
Envisioneering Group (Seaford, N.Y.).

Doherty described IBM's iNet porting facility as a
"virtual service bureau," but said developers who still
want the security and sanctity of testing their
applications in person can take their applications to the
facility in San Mateo.

The Envisioneering Group has accessed the site and built
ports on IBM's supercomputers.  "There's nothing else
like it," Doherty said.  "You can call into the heart of
the technology, try out ideas in private, and have access
to thousands of dollars of development time."

TRY BEFORE THEY BUY

Not only can developers test out their applications,
developers can bring their clients in and walk through
the applications with them to work through any problems,
Doherty explained.  "This is a `try before they buy' set
up," he said.  "You couldn't ask for a better match of
customer and vendor."

Other companies may try to copy elements of IBM's iNet
porting facility, but Doherty said IBM gives developers
lots of access to its system.  "These things are usually
portioned out in terms of minutes, not in terms of tens
of hours," he said.  "IBM has dozens of ports to ensure
that each developer has 22 continuous hours.

"That's unique -- that's not just driving the car around
the block, that's like borrowing it from the dealer for
a weekend," Doherty said.

DATA RULES

Another analyst agreed that IBM's interest in Internet
applications is good for the company.  "IBM has a point
of leverage in this new environment -- it's called data,"
said John Robb, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.).

IBM has huge amounts of data, mostly on its back-end
systems, Robb explained.  "IBM wants to help companies
distribute or publish or integrate that data with their
Web offerings," he said.  "So anything that IBM can offer
in the way of tool sets is positive.

"Everyone wants to Web-enable their legacy systems," Robb
said.  "IBM should be in the business of helping
companies do that."

IBM TO EXPAND RMON SUPPORT

Although IBM has supported RMON for some time, the
company is introducing extensions to the network
monitoring standard across its hub products starting in
the next few months.

The extensions include two probe modules, one designed
to resemble the RMON 2 standard once it is finalized and
another to generate test traffic on a local area network.
Right now, IBM has only one probe capable of performing
these functions: an Ethernet probe for its 8250 Nways
intelligent hub which can monitor three Ethernet segments
simultaneously.

In the coming months, IBM will announce these
capabilities for the 8260, at the top of IBM's line, said
Sallie Matlack, an IBM-certified IT specialist.  Lesser
IBM hubs will receive these extensions sometime in the
future.

RMON (remote network monitoring) is an industry-standard
method of collecting statistical data at the physical and
data layers of network segments and sending the data back
to a central site for analysis.  RMON-compliant probes
can also detect problems and send warnings to the
management station.

RMON 2 will expand the range of data that can be
gathered, looking at higher functions such as network
protocols and applications, and will provide an end-to-
end view.

IBM's Enterprise Communications Analysis Module (ECAM)
is a block of software that looks at the same things RMON
2 will when the standard is complete.  IBM has created
a mechanism where ECAM can be automatically downloaded
from a management station into a probe that has been
engineered to accept modules like ECAM.

IBM's other RMON extension, called Traffic Transmission
Management Module (TTMM), can take network traffic
collected through other monitoring tools and spit it out
onto a local segment.  This lets network managers monitor
the impact on that segment via performance monitoring
tools.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER

To handle the information gathered through RMON probes,
IBM last October introduced a version of its software
product Nways Campus Manager - ReMon, a version that
includes ECAM and TTMM.  In November, IBM brought the
software from NetView for AIX to HP OpenView.

ReMon lets managers tell the distributed agents which
packets to capture and send back to the management
platform.  It also displays the information gathered from
the probes graphically.

IDC FORECASTS A GLOOMY 1996 FOR THE INDUSTRY

In spite of a bullish 10-year outlook for on-line
commerce, researcher International Data Corp. (IDC)
yesterday predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment
as investors and corporations suffer through the
discouragingly slow development of a significant consumer
base.

By this time next year, IDC predicted 20 percent of the
Fortune 500 companies that have commercial Web sites will
close or stop maintaining them, resulting in "ghost"
sites.

On-line information service providers (such as
CompuServe, America Online, Microsoft Network, and
Prodigy) will derive more than half of their revenue from
providing access to the Web by mid-1997.  IDC predicts
that two of the four will struggle to survive.

"In 1996 we predict that the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's `intoxication' stage
to a `hangover' stage," said Frank Gens, senior vice
president of research at IDC, the world's leading
provider of information technology (IT) data, analysis,
and counseling.  "The high-flying Internet suppliers will
have disappointing financial results, while technical
capabilities of the Internet are stretched to the
breaking point."

Gens also said IT industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate
spending on IT will rise from 2 percent of revenues to
more than 5 percent. In addition, IDC said it believes
on-line commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more by
the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

"Some financial service companies, retailers, and
publishers will bail out in the initial hangover period,"
Gens said.  "In the process, they will cripple their
businesses' ability to compete in the growing `virtual
economy.' In contrast, leaders in the emerging electronic
marketplace will significantly increase their
investments. In the process, the seeds will be sown for
the creation of new leadership and the downfall of some
current giants in many industries."

INTERNET APPLIANCES

By this time next year, IDC predicts that manufacturers
of "Internet appliances" -- low-cost devices that allow
the user to access on-line information -- will ultimately
slash prices in half by year's end.

Internet Appliances will arrive in 1996, but the
successful ones won't be priced at $500, Gens said.  They
will come out of the gates at $100 to $300.  The game
console crowd is already slicing away at the pricing for
simple Web surfing devices.  Within two years, Internet
Appliances will emerge as giveaways (less than $100 to
free) by businesses that want customers to access their
on-line services, according to Gens.

"Price competition in data to the home will become
brutal," Gens said.  IDC predicted that high-performance
Internet access will be delivered to the home for as
little as $15 to $20 per month in 1996, down from $25 to
$70.  Pricing will drop to $10 to $15 per month within
the next two years, partially because cable companies
(with the help of affordable cable modems) will play the
Internet card as their first foray in the
telecommunications business.  Telephone companies will
respond with more aggressive pricing.

According to IDC, in 1996 and 1997, suppliers will
aggressively explore new home PC designs to drive down
prices of multimedia devices to $800 to $1,000 (and less)
in an effort to penetrate broader segments of the
increasingly important consumer market.  It will be
paramount for PC vendors to become better acquainted with
the mainstream consumer electronics market and mentality,
and learn a whole new meaning of "price-competitive."
Without doubt, the winners in the PC business in the
coming decade will be those that crack the mass-market
barrier, IDC said.

MICROSOFT

IDC predicted Microsoft will have a great year in 1996,
but its hold will be challenged by the Internet-based
"Revenge of the (Unix) Nerds."  One effect of the
Internet phenomenon of 1995 has been that many on Wall
Street and within the IT industry now are forecasting the
undoing of Microsoft's hold on the industry, and hailing
the rise of Netscape and Sun Microsystems as the new
industry leaders.

"While IDC recognizes the potential of the Internet world
to weaken several of Microsoft's key levers on the
industry, such as OLE and Visual Basic, there will be
relatively little revenue effect from this in 1996," Gens
said.  "We also believe in spite of the recurring rumors
of Department of Justice investigations, Microsoft will
escape any major antitrust activity in 1996, an election
year.  Additionally, Microsoft will conclude that its
ventures into new businesses will have a greater chance
of success without the Microsoft brand."

OTHER PREDICTIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR

* There will be an Internet-driven shakeout in the
application software and application development tools
businesses in 1996 and 1997.  The emergence of the Web,
and the growing importance of entertaining,
multimedia-rich interfaces, will challenge the current
crop of client/server tool suppliers like Microsoft,
Powersoft, Dynasty, Forte, and Seer, as well as
application package companies like SAP and Peoplesoft.

* Software licensing will support network access and
short-term "rental."  Behind the scenes, suppliers are
currently exploring how to "crack the code"  on this
charging model; the leaders will begin experimenting in
the marketplace in 1996 and 1997.

* Large systems will become "politically correct."
High-end servers will increasingly be required to scale
to support direct access by thousands to potentially
millions of users, as opposed to today's hundreds to
thousands of corporate users.  This accelerated scaling
requirement will put pressure on Microsoft's enterprise
strategy due to NT's relatively low-end design point,
and boost the Unix camp's high-end business.
Beneficiaries will be IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun
Microsystems, and -- perhaps -- a rejuvenated Digital.

* The increased scope of the Net will favor suppliers
that excel in creating "virtual organizations."
Successful suppliers will be able to play well in a
"virtual organization"  structure -- able to act as
creator, investor, producer, and/or partner.

CAMBEX UNVEILS MAINFRAME DISK ARRAY

Cambex Corp. last month announced a high-performance disk
array subsystem that supports both IBM System/390
mainframe and client/server data storage requirements.

The Cascade XE (cross-enterprise) system provides high
availability and up to 272 gigabytes of storage in a
single DASD product.  The Cascade XE can be
simultaneously attached to an IBM mainframe 3990 disk
controller and to open systems platforms, including IBM
RS/6000 and SP2, SUN SPARC, Hewlett-Packard 9000 and
Microsoft's Windows NT.

Cambex also announced an XE Backup/Restore option which
supports the use of existing mainframe tape subsystems,
management tools, and procedures.  The software option
provides backup for both legacy and open systems storage.

The amount of storage in the Cascade XE available for
each platform is scalable, enabling the user to
reconfigure capacity levels to accommodate a gradual
transition from one operating environment to another
within the same disk array unit.

"FIREWALL" PROTECTION INCLUDED

Mainframe and open systems environments operate
independently and are isolated through an electronic
"firewall" that ensures data security and integrity.
Unlike other solutions, data paths and cache memories are
not shared between the different host environments,
thereby ensuring that data cannot be corrupted by
component failure or operator error.

A Cascade XE configured with 68G of RAID-1 mainframe DASD
and 68G of RAID-5 open systems storage is priced at
$265,000, or less than $1.95 per megabyte.  In a larger
configuration of 136G of mainframe and 136G of open
systems storage, the Cascade XE system is priced at
$475,000, or $1.75 per megabyte.

Since storage assigned to open systems platforms can be
connected to the IBM 3990 controller, the Cascade XE also
provides users with a cross-enterprise backup capability
under System/390 storage management facilities.  The XE
Backup/Restore option increases the use of existing
mainframe tape facilities by extending support to the
backup and restoration of open systems storage within the
Cascade XE subsystem.

SUN SCORES WELL IN PRICE/PERFORMANCE RUNNING
DB2 VERSION 2

Sun Microsystems Computer Co. announced the industry's
best-ever price/performance results for the Transaction
Processing Performance Council Benchmark C (TPC-C)
benchmark.

Sun's SPARCserver 1000E with eight 85 MHz SuperSPARC
processors, running IBM's DB2/a Version 2 database server
software on the Solaris 2.4 symmetric multiprocessing
(SMP) operating system, delivered results of 3255.88
transactions per minute (tpmC) at a price/performance of
$182 per tpmC.

The new performance results are the best-ever published
DB2 Version 2 performance figures and the first on a
non-IBM platform, demonstrating the commitment of IBM and
Sun to open industry standards.

According to Janet Perna, director of database technology
in IBM Software Solutions Division, "We are excited at
this opportunity to demonstrate IBM DB2 Version 2's
superior performance and reliability features on the Sun
Solaris system as part of this TPC-C benchmark.  This
demonstrates IBM's continuing commitment to making its
leadership database products available on all
high-performance platforms -- something our customers
require in order to maintain their competitive edge in
the marketplace."

The TPC-C benchmark simulates an order entry environment
for a warehouse operation.  The benchmark has gained
industry acceptance because it is considered to be
similar to "real world" processing. By simulating the
activities found in complex Online Transaction Processing
(OLTP) application environments, the TPC-C benchmark
exercises a system's breadth of components associated
with such environments.
