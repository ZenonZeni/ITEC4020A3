EVACUATE! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!
A few lessons, and one or two laughs from an actual evacuation.

By:
Dan Manningham

On October 9, 1969, United Airlines Flight 74 operated as a DC-8 from Las
Vegas to New York. Fred Edwards was the captain, Tom Greene was second
officer (Flight Engineer) and I was in the copilot seat. It was a typical
``Vegas'' trip, being nearly full with a crowd of New Yorkers on their way
home from the tables.
   In the front lounge, four passengers were playing poker. These were four
rough-looking guys. Tough, mean, angry. Definitely not the types you would
expect to see at an arts festival or the garden club.
   One of those men would make an excellent character for a movie. He could
be in the orthopedic business, a bone specialist. He could be named
``Frank'' or something. At least that's how he looked to me.
   This Frank appeared to have a 20-inch neck, 30-inch sleeve, 40-inch
waist, was about 50 years old, 60 pounds overweight, 70 inches tall with an
IQ of 80. He had hands like shovels and a face like raw meat. And he looked
mean. This was not a guy who worried about whales or human suffering in a
drought-stricken country.
   The IQ thing was just appearance, though. Frank was no dummy. As the
game progressed, Frank stuffed his considerable winnings into his
see-through shirt so that his ample torso was eventually obscured by layers
of tens and twenties. By the time we began the Canarsie VOR approach to
Runway 13L at JFK, Frank was finishing a solid payday, and his three
companions were looking unhappy.
   In the cockpit, the flight was completely normal. The evening in New
York was clear, cool and calm in the nicest sense of a fall twilight. Fred
flew the Canarsie approach with his usual skill, and we rolled out right on
final and with the VASI lights perfectly red over white. The touchdown was
sweet, and we made the early turnoff with the help of considerable engine
reverse. Fred was an artist of flight.
   As we cleared the runway, our day began in earnest with the simultaneous
arrival of two separate communications. First, the tower controller called
to say, ``United 74, it appears that your right wing is on fire.'' At the
same instant, the cabin call chime rang urgently, and Tom grabbed the phone
to hear the aft flight attendant say that the entire right wing was in
flames. Without warning, we were on fire in a big way, and the conclusion
to a routine flight suddenly became the beginning of a serious challenge.
The next five minutes contained so many separate activities that 26 years
later, my memory is expanded as if it contained several hours.
   My job was to proceed (that was the word in the emergency
procedure-''proceed'') to the ground and direct the evacuation from there.
It was my favorite emergency assignment: Leave the burning airplane for
others to deal with, and help the passengers as they came off (as in, ``You
stay here, and I'll go for help.'')
   Fred and I shut down all four engines, and the airplane was suddenly
quiet and dark. The emergency lights worked off a dedicated battery, and
that provided minimal illumination. My ``proceeding'' took me over the
pedestal and directly across Tom's lap. (I think he still has a heel print
on his right thigh.)
   When I opened the cockpit door, the forward flight attendant-a large
woman-was just latching open the big entry door. Her size had combined with
an adrenaline rush to create enough raw energy to slam that heavy door open
like the screen door on Grandpa's cabin. The slide was inflating nicely,
too.
   For some reason, the PA wasn't functioning, so I exercised my
considerable talents at sheer oral volume to announce to the passengers
that leaving the airplane was a wise choice at this particular time of
their lives. I just shouted that message down the long, dark cabin and was
amazed to watch passengers suddenly spring to their feet in search of an
exit. I later learned that the flight attendants at the rear door heard
every word clearly, a fact that did not surprise my children.
   Frank did not need any such instruction. He had seen the flames through
his window and pushed his way onto the slide after scooping up all of the
money on the table and stuffing it into his already bulging shirt. He hit
the ground running and was never seen again. Not in the assembly. Not on
the buses to the terminal. And not at baggage claim. Frank had his own
agenda.
   I followed Frank to the ground, and instructed the next two passengers
to assist others as they came off the slide before I moved to the next
evacuation station. New Yorkers were leaving the airplane like commuters at
their home station. From the over-wing exit, passengers were sliding off
the flap, and I asked one of the men to instruct the evacuees to assemble
on the grass well clear of the airplane. I still hadn't seen the right wing
where the fire was, but I was on my way. Approximately 30 seconds had
elapsed from the initial transmission from the tower.
   As I rounded the tail, the airplane appeared completely normal in every
respect, with no evidence of fire or any other distress. This was both
pleasing and puzzling, but the evacuation was in progress and needed to be
concluded as safely as possible.
   When I reached the right-flap area, a large, ungainly woman was just
scooting toward the drop-off point and sobbing in terror at the prospect of
sliding those 10 feet or so to the ground. I made a quick judgment call to
send her back through the airplane because I could see that she would
almost certainly suffer severe harm in the drop. By this time her . . .
well, her ah . . . her umm . . . posterior was somewhat critically balanced
at the flap hinge so that she had great difficulty performing a maneuver
that could best be described as cheek reversal. Still, with the help of
loud encouragement and a male passenger on the wing, she was able to
wriggle her hindquarters back up onto the wing far enough to stand up and
walk back to the over-wing exit. From there, she could re-enter the
airplane and then leave again in a relatively safe and dignified manner by
way of an entrance door slide.
   By this time, no more people were coming out, so I returned to the left
side where the passengers were assembling, sort of. Getting 120 passengers
to stand still in one area following a serious emotional trauma was like
herding turtles. Individuals and groups just kept wandering off and had to
be repeatedly asked to stay put for a head count.
   Suddenly, that big empty airplane seemed very dark and quiet. A light
breeze flowed across JFK, and a sweet melancholy pervaded the scene of 120
people who were safely evacuated but now were coping with very real and
very recent fear. Passengers stood around in small groups and talked
quietly as though something solemn was happening. And in a way, it was.
   At that moment, a young man approached me to say that his ``baby was
still on the airplane.'' That started the adrenaline all over again, and I
scrambled up the aft slide into the dark cabin of the abandoned airliner, a
feat that proved to be far more difficult than I anticipated due to the
angle and slickness of the slide. I noticed Fred right behind me, and
together we searched the cabin but found nothing. No passengers, no baby
and only the detritus of 120 human beings on their way home from a
completely frivolous journey: decks of cards, newspapers and empty cups. We
searched again, quickly, and then slid to the ground for the second time to
find the father with his baby in his arms. There never was an explanation.
Fathers are entitled to that.
   Now I noticed that the area was filling with fire vehicles, police
cruisers and airport officials. Shortly thereafter, buses arrived to take
the passengers to the terminal where they would eventually retrieve their
luggage. Somehow, we got our bags from the airplane and made our way to the
company office spaces in the United hangar. It was a lousy way to end a
trip, and it was not over.
   Fred knew that the NTSB-and others-would want a complete statement of
the event. He also knew that it was difficult to provide a coherent and
consistent statement from three individuals. Therefore, we grabbed another
pilot in operations and adjourned to a diner to review the experience.
Fred, Tom and I sorted through the details of a 60-second experience for
nearly three hours until we were satisfied that the details were correct
and in proper sequence.
   I went home and typed three copies on my 20-year-old mechanical Royal so
that we could meet with various investigative bodies in the morning and
sound rational as a crew in the process. This was not an exercise in
obfuscation but, rather, an attempt to organize our collective memories for
accuracy.
   We all agreed that the evacuation was a valuable experience, gained with
minimal harm to people or property. We were all surprised by the great
value of United's disciplined and repeated training in evacuations.
According to the control tower's reckoning, the airplane was completely
emptied in less than 60 seconds. If the fire had propagated, that might
have been all the time we would have had.
   We all chuckled at ``Frank'' and his behavior, but that was a lesson in
human independence and fickleness.
   We noticed that nothing ever works as planned; in this case, the PA
failed when we needed it most. Also, the aft, left slide originally
deployed straight down, which would have prevented its use. But,
fortunately, some passengers were able to shake it into position. Still,
that delayed the evacuation for several seconds.
   I personally reviewed my decision to send two or three people back into
the airplane from the right wing, and concluded that it did probably save a
serious injury-but at some risk to those passengers if the fire had
rekindled. Still, it's always hard to argue with success. It could have
gone wrong, but it didn't.
   We noticed in retrospect that the lack of daylight complicated the
entire procedure. Darkness in the cabin and on the ground made everything
more difficult. Pocket flashlights were a tremendous help.
   I was impressed by the readiness of passengers to respond to firm, loud
orders to evacuate. Even those who had watched the fire through the windows
didn't move toward the exits until expressly ordered to do so by a
crewmember.
   We all found the process of developing a coherent statement together to
be extremely beneficial. The Safety Board received that statement the way
in which it was intended, and no one questioned our motives for preparing
it.
   The morning meetings went well. No threat of legal or punitive action
was raised. In fact, we were given a compliment or two. After meeting with
the officials, I walked out to look over the airplane.
   It was sunny that morning-sunny and warm. The DC-8 stood alone on the
hangar ramp; deserted. It looked more dignified with its doors closed and
the slides removed. It looked like the proud airplane it was, even as it
looked isolated and abandoned. It was a reminder that character is within
the individual, not the group.
   I examined the aircraft carefully, but there was no evidence of a fire.
No soot, or charring or damage. The lighting that morning was excellent,
and any evidence of fire should have been clearly visible, but there was
none. I would find out later that no one ever did find evidence of a fire.
The great fire that had alarmed the tower controllers from more than a mile
away, that the flight attendants saw through the windows and that
frightened Frank was a mystery. Some things just are.

ATC ON THE BLINK
ATC computers seem to be dropping like flies. What's wrong with the system,
and what will you encounter if you get caught in an outage?

By:
Perry Bradley

   In May 1993, when the Clinton administration began its push for
corporatizing the ATC system, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and
Vice President Al Gore held a press conference at Washington National
Airport to demonstrate just how dire was the need for change. Pena and Gore
held up vacuum tubes and displayed archaic computer terminals to prove the
point that the FAA desperately needed reform.
   As it turns out, the publicity stunt with the vacuum tube was prophetic.
Although several plans for FAA reform have come and gone in the intervening
years, aging ATC equipment has begun to exact its toll on the system's
users, as predicted.
   Even though overall system availability is at 99.4 percent-an all-time
high-reports of equipment outages seem to be coming ever more frequently,
especially at Air Route Traffic Control Centers. Witness these recent
examples:
   -- On August 9, 1995, a power out-age at Oakland Center caused 333
delays and one TCAS resolution alert. Full service was restored after 78
minutes.
   -- On September 7, 1995, a power failure at Kansas City Center caused a
service interruption lasting six hours, 23 minutes, resulting in 13
delays.
   -- On October 17, 1995, a power failure at Fort Worth Center resulted
in 263 delayed flights. The equipment failure lasted 14 hours, 35 minutes;
air traffic services were disrupted for 12 minutes.
   -- On September 11, 1995, a computer failure at Chicago Center resulted
in 35 delays and one ``operational error.'' Service was fully restored in
two hours, eight minutes. On November 1, two computer failures at Chicago
Center resulted in 313 delays.
   -- On November 16, 1995, New York Center twice went to back-up systems
for a total of 48 minutes due to a computer error. Approximately 30
aircraft were delayed.

AN AGING SYSTEM
   Glitches like these were never supposed to happen. The Advanced
Automation System (AAS), conceived in the mid 1980s, was to have completely
modernized and restructured the nation's ATC system. AAS' failure is well
documented. Almost from the outset, program milestones began slipping, and
costs skyrocketed. Several program reviews followed, ultimately resulting
in a radical restructuring of the automation plans.
   Stan Rivers, the FAA's deputy director for airway facilities, says
today's problems have their roots in delays in the modernization program.
``You just can't keep stuff around for 30 or 40 years without running into
sustainability problems,'' he notes, explaining that wiring becomes
brittle, components wear out, and it gets tougher to find people who know
how to keep the old systems running. ``That's just age, and there's almost
nothing you can do about it.''
   Federal officials prefer the term ``service interruption'' to outage.
But semantics aside, no one disagrees that the ATC system is showing its
age. And with even temporary fixes more than a year away, experts also
agree that the string of interruptions will continue for the foreseeable
future.
   While news reports have tended to lump all the failures together, in
fact, the interruptions have occurred for a variety of reasons-some
related, some downright mundane. For instance, New York Center twice went
to its back-up systems on November 16, 1995, prompting some limited delays.
While a software problem initially was suspected, it turned out a stuck key
at a controller's workstation sent 14,000 commands to one of the center's
computers, overwhelming it and prompting it to shut down, according to John
Walker, who manages New York Center.
   Still, there are two common threads linking a number of the outages over
the past year: First, the most serious upsets have been complete power
failures that ironically stemmed from an initiative to upgrade the power
grid at the 20 center facilities. Oakland, California, New York and Chicago
Center all had complete failures during the switch to the new ARTCC
Critical and Essential Power System, or ACEPS.
   ``At some point, you have to switch over from the old to the new, and
that's a sensitive transfer,'' says Rivers. The FAA has since revised some
of its procedures for working on the power grid to minimize the chance of a
problem.
   The other frequently implicated component is a 1960s-vintage IBM
mainframe computer that drives controller displays in the five busiest
centers. In the mid 1970s, 15 of the 20 center facilities made the
transition to a Raytheon Computer Display Channel. However, the five
centers with the highest volume-Chicago, Cleveland, Fort Worth, New York
and Washington, D.C.-retained the older IBM 9020Es that are failing with
increasing regularity. In August 1995, the FAA decided to invest $65
million to replace the 9020Es, beginning in 1997.

REDUNDANT SYSTEMS
   Despite all the hype, chances are if a center has a failure, you will
actually feel very little impact-if you know about it at all, according to
controllers and FAA officials. The centers are built with at least two
layers of redundant systems backing up the primary operating system. (See
accompanying graphic.)
   Of the more than 82-million air traffic operations annually, fewer than
250,000 experience delays, according to the FAA. Some 98 percent of delays
are weather related, leaving just two percent of all delays attrib-utable
to equipment failures. Still, it does happen.
   Simply stated, an air route traffic control center comprises three basic
computing components: the host computer, the Display Channel Complex (DCC)
and the Direct Access Radar Channel (DARC). The systems are intertwined in
such a way that if one of them fails, the others can make up for its
absence, albeit with reduced capabilities.
   The host computers, IBM 3038 mainframes installed in the mid 1980s, are
the nerve center of the operation. They handle all flight-data processing
including flight plans, automated hand-offs, and automatic flight-progress
strip generation.
   From the host computer, data are fed to the DCC. The DCC processes radar
information and drives the controller's display. Ironically, the five
busiest centers have the oldest DCCs. ``They're a little older than
anything else we've got,'' says the FAA's Rivers.
   The final component in the triad is the DARC. The DARC is a back-up
system that sends comparatively raw radar data directly to controller
workstations. If the DCC fails, the system reverts to DARC/Host operations.
If the DCC and the host computer both fail, the system goes to DARC-only
operations, the most degraded condition short of an all-out shutdown.

WHEN THE SYSTEM BLINKS
   Denis Burke has had more than his fair share of experience with computer
outages and back-up systems over the last year or so. As air traffic
manager at Chicago Center, Burke has seen seven outages since September
1994, and says he expects more. ``Technicians are watching over [the 9020E]
very carefully,'' Burke comments. ``It's been gone over with a fine-toothed
comb. We expect that though we will probably experience some more outages,
they won't be significant.''
   When a system does fail, the first thing the center will do is
``sterilize'' its airspace, according to Burke. In September 1994, Chicago
experienced its worst outage (to date) when power to the facility was
interrupted for an instant during maintenance. After the outage, all of the
computers had to spool back up, a process Burke likens to rebooting your
home computer. In that instance, it took just 12 minutes to sterilize the
center's 133,000-square-mile chunk of airspace.
   In the event of an outage, the center contacts FAA flow control, which
institutes a ground hold on any inbound aircraft not yet airborne. Traffic
already en route, but not yet in the affected center's airspace, will be
rerouted around the center. Aircraft already in the center's airspace might
be asked to hold while controllers verify that all the aircraft they are
handling are up on the back-up system. Alternatively, some aircraft in the
area may be handed off to other centers or to approach controllers.
   Controllers often let pilots know when they are experiencing equipment
trouble, but notification is not required. Some of the hallmarks of a
problem, says Burke, are ground delays on days when weather obviously isn't
an issue, or when you suddenly hear new transponder codes being given to
aircraft in your area. Because their workload goes up during an outage,
controllers often will ask pilots not to read back instructions unless so
advised.
   Power outages also can take down radios. In the event of a com failure,
you are expected to adhere to your last clearance and to attempt to
reestablish communications on your last assigned frequency. If that doesn't
work, try calling the nearest flight service station, or any other ATC
facility in your area-an approach control or control tower, for instance.
Chances are, by the time you establish contact, word of the failure will be
out, and plans will be set in motion to handle the aircraft involved.
   Burke and other facility mangers who have experienced outages say pilots
have conducted themselves in outstanding fashion. Indeed, the FAA confirms
just two operational errors in 1995 during outages. Obviously, TCAS is a
valuable tool for pilots and provides an additional safety net during an
outage.

FAILURE MODES
   Noting the system's inherent redundancy, Burke says the transition to
the DARC/Host-the primary back-up-can be virtually transparent. ``Truly the
only catastrophe that's involved is the lack of ability to move the same
volume of traffic,'' he explains.
   In DARC/Host mode, controllers begin to lose some of their ``enhanced''
capabilities. No longer do they get automatic conflict alerts, minimum safe
altitude warnings, or the ability to put a five-mile distance reference
indicator circle around slow-moving traffic to ease vectoring other
aircraft.
   However, most functions of the primary system are replicated. ``The
information you need to separate airplanes is all there: location, speed,
altitude, direction of flight, and flight plan,'' says Burke.
``Everything's there, but some of the enhancements that have been added
over the years are no longer there, and that's always a concern, but it's
not a safety issue.''
The host computer continues to operate in DARC/Host mode, and that means
controllers still have access to flight-plan information, can automatically
hand-off traffic to other ATC facilities, and get automatic preparation of
paper flight-progress strips that are used to back-up radar information.
   If the primary system fails, controllers may have a little additional
work to ensure that the transition to the back-up is successful. But once
the changeover is verified, operations should be almost business as usual.
   A worse event is the failure of both the DCC and the host computer.
Although rare, such dual failures have occurred, and their impact can be
dramatic. In essence, when the system reverts to DARC only, controllers
have to do their work either manually or verbally, which reduces the
ability to handle traffic by as much as 70 percent.
   For instance, while radar screens still track aircraft, all of the
flight-data-processing functions go off-line when the host computer shuts
down. That means controllers have to manually create and update data strips
and hand-off all traffic verbally, which requires land-line contact with
other controllers.

TO THE RESCUE?
   The recent spate of outages and the attention they've gotten in the
press have prompted the FAA to decide to spend $65 million to upgrade the
troublesome 9020Es at the five centers that still have them. Chicago is
slated to get the first upgrade in January 1997, with the others to follow
at the rate of one per month through May 1997. DCC Rehost, as the project
is called, initially was conceived as an ``insurance'' program to offset
old computers reaching a critical state before broader center upgrades
begin in 1998.
   On August 1, 1995, DOT Secretary Pena cashed in the insurance policy and
announced that the Rehost program would proceed. Essentially, the Rehost
program uses new hardware to operate the software currently running on the
9020E. If all goes according to schedule, the Rehost will serve as a
Band-Aid until the $1.1-billion Display System Replacement (DSR) program
begins to replace center hardware and software in 1998. In 2001, the FAA
plans to upgrade DARC to make it a more robust and automated back-up; and
in 2002, ARTCC host computers will be replaced to increase capacity.
   Other FAA initiatives triggered by the rash of service interruptions
include reviewing and updating contingency plans at all centers, retraining
controllers on making the transition to back-up systems, training more
technicians to work on the old equipment, and adding more controllers at
Chicago Center.
   Controllers themselves look on promised computer fixes with a jaundiced
eye. ``In the corporate world, most King Airs fly with two pilots, even
though they can be operated by one,'' observes Mark Scholl, who heads the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) union shop at Chicago
Center. ``The FAA doesn't staff a facility like you'd staff an airplane.
We're staffed for the best sunny day in July, not an emergency.''
   Citing years of delays in the former advanced automation system,
controllers at Chicago Center say they doubt the Rehost program or the DSR
will happen as scheduled. ``[Adding staff] is a concrete thing that will
help,'' according to Bryan Zilonis, another NATCA representative in
Chicago. ``Computers are just another promise, and we've heard that
before.''
   Whether it's new computers, new people, or a combination of both that
provides the fix, everyone involved with the ATC system agrees that
additional service interruptions are likely-at least for the next year. The
transition to back-ups often is seamless, but prudence dictates that
flightcrews, like controllers, take a little extra time to review their
contingency plans.
   ``You just have to remind yourself that it's a possibility,'' Burke
advises pilots. ``You need to sit up, listen up and be prepared.''

CHICAGO'S FBOS
A ring of airports with first-class services keeps business aviation in and
around Chicagoland on the move.

By:
Robert B. Parke

   Business is thriving for most of the dedicated business-aviation FBOs in
the Chicago area.
   A score or more of fine airports that offer services to corporate
aircraft of every sort dot the Chicago area, but a half dozen in the
immediate vicinity of Chicago's business centers get the bulk of the
business. Each of these closer airfields has 5,000-plus-foot runways and
suitable instrument approaches, plus other accommodations for larger
corporate aircraft. And perhaps surprisingly, for many crews headed for
Chicago, there is no better destination than that mother of all humongous
airports, O'Hare International (KORD).

THAT MAMMOTH O'HARE
   In spite of O'Hare's consistently leading the list of the world's
airports with the largest number of movements per year and having
occasional, vastly inconvenient ATC failures, many pilots appreciate its
controllers for their precise communications and handling. For the most
part, flightcrews appreciate their grasp of corporate aircraft needs.
   ``Best in the world,'' said one corporate pilot munching popcorn fresh
from the O'Hare Signature Flight Support popcorn machine while other
aircrew members nodded approval. ``They know that we need to stay aloft,
and they cooperate. All you have to do is your standard homework and stay
with them, and you're in and out fast. We have fewer delays here than we do
at other smaller airports. And when feasible, they will land us close to
the general-aviation area.''
   Runways 9R (10,141 feet) and 4R (8,071 feet) feed directly into the
corporate-aviation parking area in the southeast corner of the vast complex
where Signature Flight Support provides services.
   Several flightcrew members gave particular credit for their satisfaction
with ORD to the squeaky clean, spacious Signature facilities. They touted
the usual crew amenities such as lounge rooms and rest areas, in addition
to the Signature specialties of loaner cars and fresh popcorn.
   Managed by Michael Brasier, the O'Hare FBO provides a large parking ramp
with plenty of overflow room nearby. On-site deicing is available. Access
from parking to the Signature reception area is through a tightly guarded
security gate. This can be cleared by a van driven by a Signature
representative, or a limousine can pick up or deliver passengers if
accompanied by a Signature representative.
   Also, Signature's fleet of vans picks up and delivers corporate-aircraft
passengers connecting with commercial flights.
   The Signature reception desk handles orders and services, and explains
the Signature Prime Rate II formula for fuel pricing.
   A helipad is located near the general-aviation area and is used for
charter flights to outlying business centers and by several corporations
that operate frequent shuttle services from O'Hare to business headquarters
on the fringes of Chicago.
   Landing fees at O'Hare for FAR Part 91 operations are set at $2.59 per
thousand pounds maximum landing weight, and slightly lower for Part 135
operators.

ON TO THE MIDWAY
   Midway Airport (KMDW) offers miles of runways, four precision
approaches, two full-service FBOs and 40 minutes driving time to downtown
Chicago. Located 15 miles southeast of O'Hare, Midway is still the airport
of choice for many corporate operators.
   KMDW features eight runways, each over 5,000 feet, three with ILS
approaches and one runway-22L-with an MLS, assuring landings under most
adverse weather conditions.
   Situated in one of the industrial parts of town, Midway is surrounded by
low-profile commercial structures. The area generates relatively few noise
complaints and, consequently, is favored by regional airlines as well as by
corporate operators.
   Several large Chicago-based corporations have built their own hangar and
service areas on the field.
   Until three years ago, regional-airline traffic had grown to a volume
where a mandatory slot system had become necessary. This was dropped when
several airlines ceased operations. Recently, Southwest Airlines (as well
as several other carriers) established operations at Midway, and plans for
a new airline terminal are under way. At the same time, there is talk of
reinstating the slot system.
   Signature at KMDW, which is managed by Brent Nielson, is in a large
hangar complex on the west side of the airport. The Signature FBO provides
all the standard services including on-site deicing, and is the only
general-aviation FAA repair station on the airport.
   All of the Signature trademark specials are in evidence: flight-planning
services, crew cars, lounge and rest areas, popcorn and mountain bikes.
(Demand for mountain bikes has been light, however.)
Just next door is the Million Air facility managed by Michael Kieffer. The
ramp and reception areas are large and welcoming.
   Monarch Air Service, also on the west side of the airport, is the base
for Duncan Avionics. Monarch, which is the oldest FBO on the airport,
services many of the lighter aircraft.
   Landing fees are pegged at $2.55 per thousand pounds max landing
weight.

AURORA: OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
   Aurora Municipal Airport (ARR) with its 6,500-foot east-west ILS Runway
9 is a good example of an airfield thriving by virtue of its
out-of-the-mainstream location (30-nm southwest of O'Hare). Also, it is
often preferred for its easy access to Chicago business districts via Route
88. In addition, ARR is praised by customers for its FBO services and
facilities, as well as for being in the epicenter of nearby industrial
development. (A Toyota distribution plant is within sight.)
   There are no landing fees, only parking and tiedown charges.
   Aurora is much admired and supported by its community. Frequent civic
events and traditional celebrations take place at the clean and
well-ordered airport. Credit for much of this feeling of good will must go
to Airport Director Robert Rieser, a promotion-oriented administrator who
always has his eye on ways to make the airport more useful to the
community.
   Rieser has prepared a complete ``Summary of Economic Impacts of Aurora
Airport'' and a ``Request for Special Funding for Aurora Airport.'' Both
documents stress the benefits of the airport, as he sees them, and present
a case for building a new 6,500-foot Runway 15-33, and related taxiways.
   His case would seem to be supported by the dramatic increase in
turbine-powered aircraft operations at the airport since the opening of the
present 6,500-foot runway six years ago.
   Two FBOs handle the burgeoning traffic. Lumanair Aviation Services was
established in 1960 by the Luman family and is run by Mike Luman, an active
pilot. In addition to a full range of business-aviation services, Lumanair
operates an FAA repair station and charter business. Lumanair is a Phillips
66 Performance Center.
   Viking Express also operates a busy FBO at ARR-with storage hangars,
charter and air freight. Robert Burwell, the company's president, claims
Viking's fuel prices are 25 percent below the average in the Chicago
region.

DuPAGE: A NEW LOOK
   Architectural modesty is not what the new DuPage Airport (DPA) ad-
ministration and services building is all about. The glass-walled,
three-story structure towers over the ramp at the northwest end of Runway
1L. Thomas H. Fawell, airport director, boasts there is nothing in the new
DuPage Airport environment that calls for modesty.
   Indeed, this general-aviation airport with its 5,100-foot ILS runway
positioned 25-nm west of O'Hare, is determined to attract corporate
operators (as well as small airlines). To accomplish this goal, the DuPage
Airport Commission constructed imposing buildings and integrated all
services such as fueling and maintenance through a central reception center
in the administration building-DuPage Flight Center. Further, the
Commission built an 18-hole golf course and business-meeting center next
door.
   According to Fawell, since its opening in 1994, the golf course and
business center already are contributing about a half-million dollars a
year to the operation of the airport, which is expected to be profitable at
least by the year 2000.
   Transient aircraft traffic is increasing daily as the policy of no
service charges or landing fees becomes well known. Fawell also expects the
heavy investment in modern snow removal and deicing equipment to begin
paying off as more aircraft divert to DuPage after the efficacy of its
equipment proves itself.
   ``We have more sophisticated ice removal and snow-removal equipment per
square foot of runway than O'Hare,'' says Fawell.
   Requests for maintenance and other services may be made directly to
DuPage Flight Center, the focal point of the airport. The staff will then
act as a guide to the wide range of FBO services available at the airport.
   In addition to being a Phillips 66 Performance Center, avionics sales
and repair, major and minor airframe and powerplant maintenance as well as
fixed and rotary wing charter are all available on the airport through the
DuPage Flight Center. Among the crew benefits offered by DuPage Flight
Center is a complete exercise room with adjoining lounge and quiet rooms.

PALWAUKEE: THE NECESSARY OPTION
   Palwaukee Municipal Airport (KPWK) sits in the middle of a busy shopping
and light-industry area, a mere eight-nm north of O'Hare. The extended
center line of its Runway 16 ILS just about bisects the area between
O'Hare's Runways 14L/32R and 4L/22R. Takeoffs on KPWK Runway 16 are limited
to aircraft that have a standard turn radius of less than 5,000 feet. A
note on the Palwaukee Two SID says, ``This [turn radius] will ensure
separation from the Runway 14R final approach course'' at O'Hare.
   It is certainly true that occasionally, movements at Palwaukee are a
tight squeeze with its neighbor to the south. But for hundreds of operators
each year, KPWK is the airport offering the best service in the area.
   Many long-time operators at Palwaukee say the principal reason for such
enduring respect and admiration is Priester Aviation, the major FBO and
veteran service provider on the airport. Charlie Priester, who founded the
operation and owned the airport in 1952, still is a part-owner and daily
worker. In 1986, he sold the airport and a large part of the Priester
operation to the local community. Today, his son, Mike, is a part of the
still-growing Priester activities at the airport, although the majority
ownership is held by a small group of investors. These backers include
Richard Ferris, former chairman of United Airlines, Arnold Palmer,
celebrity golf pro, and Mark McCormack, head of a management corporation.
   On an average day, the ramp area outside the Priester operation often
resembles the corporate-aircraft display area at an NBAA convention.
Elsewhere on the airport, new hangars are under construction.
   Another construction project at KPWK will add more clear area at each
end of the 5,100-foot Runway 16/34. The planned improvements also will
allow the Runway 16 ILS localizer, which is now offset three degrees, to be
centered, resulting in lower minimums.
   Because of an increase in international flights by its customers,
Priester arranged with U.S. Customs to establish a special clearance
facility paid for by Priester and by arriving international flights, at the
airport. Other improvements include the planned construction of a new tower
and a new Priester reception/administration building in an area being
cleared in the northeast corner of the airport.
   Priester imposes a minimum fuel-service charge, combined with a
fuel-discount price program. According to Mike Pryor, Priester marketing
manager, the service charge is rarely imposed, since the minimum fuel
purchase is almost invariably met.
   Priester is not noted for promotions or gimmicks to entice customers.
But, the company does have its One-Stop Check-In program. Here is how it
works: After appropriate screening and suitable notification, aircraft crew
personnel can simply check in at the Priester reception desk and pick up
two keys. One is for the rental car waiting outside (with all paperwork
having been completed), and the second is for a pre-registered room in a
nearby hotel.
   The other FBOs on the airport-American Flyers, predominantly a flight
school, and Service Aviation-attract primarily piston aircraft.

WAUKEGAN: `PRESIDENTIAL SERVICE'
   Waukegan Regional Airport (UGN), 25-nm north of O'Hare and 17-nm north
of Palwaukee, is outside the heavy airway-traffic zone of close-in Chicago
airports. However, it is near enough to downtown Chicago to be easily
reached by ground transportation. An additional incentive for using UGN is
its proximity to Chicago's Gold Coast, the string of upscale towns and
residential areas along the western shore of Lake Michigan, north of
Chicago.
   The airport has an ILS on Runway 23, plus a complex of administration
and reception buildings on the south side of the field. On the northwest
corner sits an impressively long row of ``high-tail'' individual hangars to
accommodate a flock of aircraft owned by major corporations in the area.
   Airport services are dominated by DB Aviation and its founder, CEO and
president Daniel A. Bitton.
   Bitton recently acquired most of the other FBOs on the field, including
the former Trans Air Aviation and Byrne Aviation, and rolled their fuel
service, avionics repair and maintenance capabilities into DB Aviation FBO,
a wholly owned subsidiary of DB Aviation.
   DB Aviation's goal is epitomized in its presidential-service logo. For
Bitton, this is no idle promotional gambit. The simulated presidential seal
is a reminder to all employees that they must reach for perfection in
carrying out their jobs.

MEIGS: CHICAGO'S HOMETOWN AIRPORT
   For many of those attending a convention at Chicago's huge McCormack
Place, a sports event at Soldier Field, or a meeting in any one of the
Chicago lakefront office buildings, the most convenient arrival is by
aircraft into Meigs Field. Meigs, practically in downtown Chicago's lap,
consists of a single, 3,899-foot, north-south VFR runway, a large parking
ramp and a pleasant reception/administration building. Signature Flight
Support is the FBO, managed by Sharon Lockhart. The airport occupies a
narrow strip along the eastern perimeter of Chicago's busy downtown and
Lake Michigan. From Meigs, a taxi ride can have you in the heart of the
city in 10 minutes.
   Meigs, with its restricted visual approach procedure, is essentially VFR
only. A VASI provides three-degree vertical guidance. The airport is
completely closed between 2200 and 0600 hours local.
   Many corporate-aircraft operators with medium to large aircraft prohibit
operations at the airport except in emergencies.
   In spite of its limitations, the airport regularly logs over 10,000
movements a year. According to a Chicago city estimate, most of these are
from travel initiated by people who are conducting business in downtown
Chicago.
   A landing fee of $2.25 per thousand pounds is imposed at Meigs, and a
daily parking fee of the same amount is charged after the first 30
minutes.
   The airport was constructed on a landfill site originally used for the
World's Fair of 1933. Following the Fair, the land was turned over to the
Chicago Park District and, in 1946, it was leased to the city to build an
airport. The lease expires in September, and the city is not planning to
renew it. Many business people and aviation organizations are vigorously
resisting such a move.

MILWAUKEE: CLAIMING A PRESENCE
   Milwaukee's airport authority loudly claims that General Mitchell
International Airport (KMKE) should be recognized as Chicago's third major
airline facility. But most corporate- aviation operators have a different
perspective. For conducting business in the Milwaukee area or in case of a
need to divert, it is nice to know that KMKE-with four precision approaches
and Category II and III capability- is only 57-nm north of O'Hare.
   A first-class, full-service Signature Flight Support facility, managed
by Jerry Grabner, is on the east side of the field. Hotels and restaurants
are nearby, as is the Harley Davidson manufacturing plant. If you don't
need General Mitchell's 8,000-foot and 9,500-foot runways, another suitable
airport of more modest size is just 10-nm farther to the northwest.
   Timmerman Airport (MWC), with a 4,100-foot runway, is barely out of
Milwaukee's northern suburbs and, accordingly, is sensitive about noise.
   Jet operations (except for Citations) require prior approval, and all
jet operations are limited to between 0545 and 2300 hours.
   Gran-Aire, the full-service FBO located on the west side of the airport,
is managed by Christopher Wodushek.

ALLIEDSIGNAL'S ENHANCED GPWS
GPS positioning precision, a terrain database and moving-map graphics
significantly improve situational awareness.

By:
Fred George

   C. Donald Bateman, AlliedSignal Commercial Avionics Systems' chief
engineer of Flight Safety Systems, has an iron stomach, which is an
essential part of his job description. Bateman has pored over hundreds of
controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accident reports to find out why
flightcrews flew otherwise well-working airplanes into the ground,
frequently snuffing out the lives of all on board.
   ``You're 20 times more likely to be involved in a CFIT accident than a
mid-air collision,'' Bateman claims. Armed with those statistics, he has
been in the forefront of GPWS development for more than 26 years.
   GPWS, mandated by the federal government two decades ago on airliners,
didn't enter service as pilots' favorite avionics box on board the
aircraft. Early systems were simplistic aural warning devices, highly prone
to nuisance or false alarms because they merely reacted to inputs from
barometric and radio altimeters.
   During its 20-year maturation, however, GPWS has evolved into a more-
effective safety system that is much less likely to ``cry wolf.'' Current
versions blend radio altimeter inputs with ILS glideslope and discrete
signals from gear and flap systems in order to modulate the thresholds at
which warnings occur. The intent is to eliminate most nuisance alarms.
However, enough false alarms still occur to cause some pilots to discount
GPWS warnings.
   Purely reactive GPWS has another problem: It can't look ahead at terrain
to help the pilot anticipate having to fly an avoidance maneuver. As a
result, the aircraft has to fly in close proximity of the terrain prior to
receiving a GPWS alert.
   Bateman's latest project is Enhanced GPWS, about which we first reported
in B/CA's June 1994 issue (``Enhancing GPWS Data,'' page 82). In contrast
to first-generation, reactive ground prox boxes, EGPWS will anticipate
terrain hazards well before they pose a threat to the aircraft. The system
provides both an aural alert and a visual display of proximate terrain on
an EFIS screen or a weather radar indicator.
   EGPWS retains the well-proven, reactive ground proximity warning
functions of older generation GPWS thus making possible FAA certification
of the new system under the existing TSO regulation.
   EGPWS uses ARINC 453, the weather radar data bus, to send full-color
terrain graphics to display systems, because it's the most common graphics
interface. As a result, weather radar graphics or terrain imagery may be
displayed on a screen, but not simultaneously. Some display systems can be
configured (at the option of the buyer) to automatically switch to terrain
imagery in the event of a terrain alert. Certain display systems also can
be configured to automatically change range scale to 10 miles to help crews
focus on the location of the terrain hazard if a terrain alert occurs.

TERRAIN DATABASE
   AlliedSignal engineers obtained a global-terrain elevation model from
the U.S. Department of Commerce. The model divides most of the Earth's
surface into 30-arc-second blocks-equivalent to one-half-mile squares at
the equator. The exceptions are countries that, for military security
reasons, don't want to release details of their terrain contours to the
public.
   Omitted from the terrain elevation database, for example, is information
about North and South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, southern Japan and
Okinawa, as well most South American countries with borders in the Andes
Mountains. Most of Africa, however, along with Russia, Mongolia and China
are included, as well as North America and Europe.
   The terrain-elevation model, nonetheless, is enormous in size--far
larger than the database storage capacity of any civil-production digital
avionics system. Bateman's team of engineers solved the storage-capacity
problem by limiting the use of the high resolution, 30-arc-second terrain
elevation blocks to circular areas within a 16-mile radius of database
airports. In the 16- to 30-mile rings from the airports, the terrain
elevation divisions are compressed into one-minute blocks-one-half the data
density of the terrain data closest to the airports. From 30 to 60 miles,
two-minute terrain blocks are used. Outside of 60 miles, the terrain model
is compressed into four-arc-minute blocks. The logic is that civil aircraft
aren't likely to operate close to the Earth's surface except when departing
or approaching landing facilities.
   Pilots will find EGPWS's airport database impressive and large-
including all public-use and military airports with hard-surfaced or
unpaved runways at least 3,500 feet long. As a result, many of the airport
circles overlap, thus providing far better than four-arc-minute resolution
over large areas. For example, most of the mountainous terrain within a
120-nm radius of Aspen, Colorado is divided into 30-arc-second, one- and
two- arc-minute blocks.
   Fifty or so airports with particularly steep, proximate terrain, such as
Juneau and Dutch Harbor, Alaska, will get even higher terrain block
resolution-15-arc-minute divisions, resulting in one-quarter-mile-square
maximum block areas.

AURAL ALERTS, THREAT DISPLAY
   EGPWS compares the aircraft's GPS position and barometric altitude with
the location of the terrain elevation contours in the database to compute
possible terrain hazards.
   Caution alerts are triggered when EGPWS anticipates encountering-in one
minute or less-a terrain hazard block that is as much as 800 feet below the
aircraft. A synthesized voice sounds, ``Caution, terrain.''
   Similarly, warning alerts are triggered when the system predicts a
terrain hazard approaching in one minute or less that is as much as 400
feet below the aircraft. The system warns, ``Terrain ahead. Pull up!
Terrain ahead. Pull up!'' Both the caution and warning avoidance maneuvers
are based on a one-quarter-g vertical acceleration.
   As shown in the accompanying illustrations, the caution and warning
alert envelopes are modulated as a function of aircraft ground speed,
airport proximity, vertical flight path, turn radius and aircraft altitude
versus airport elevation. Bateman's goal was to produce an effective safety
system with maximum credibility because of designed-in immunity to nuisance
or false alarms.

VISUAL BACKGROUND DISPLAY
   In addition to the aural and visual threat alerts, EGPWS also provides a
background terrain display on the screen when the aircraft operates within
a specified, computed ground proximity envelope. The screen remains black
when the aircraft is in level flight, and all terrain elevations within the
maximum selected display range are more than 2,000 feet below the
aircraft's barometric altitude.
   Relative terrain block elevations that are less than 2,000 feet below
the aircraft are displayed in varying densities of green, yellow and red as
a function of terrain elevation versus aircraft altitude. For example, when
the aircraft is parked at the ramp in non-mountainous areas, the screen
should be flooded with 25-percent density yellow dots, indicating that all
the terrain elevations are at or above the aircraft altitude. Green is
reserved for terrain elevations below the aircraft, but within 2,000 feet
of its altitude. There is no background display for terrain more than 2,000
feet below the aircraft, if it is in level flight.
   The various elevation floors, upon which the background colors and
pattern densities are based, also are modulated as a half function of
aircraft descent rate. If the aircraft is descending at 2,000 fpm, for
instance, all the background display floors are moved down by 1,000 feet.
   Aural alert envelopes also trigger a visual threat display. An aural
caution alert is indicated by a hazardous block illuminated in solid
yellow. The terrain block turns bright red in the event of an aural-warning
alert.

FLYING WITH EGPWS
   In September 1995, we rode along on a EGPWS demonstration flight in
AlliedSignal's Beech King Air C90. Departing from Snohomish County Paine
Field in Washington State, we flew up the Stillaquamish River valley, deep
in the Cascade Mountains. As we approached terrain on either side of the
valley, the background display indicated its location and elevation
relative to the aircraft's position and altitude. A black corridor on the
screen indicated the location of the valley floor, thereby helping us to
stay on a safe course.
   Approaching a ridge line at the end of the valley that towered 1,000
feet above the aircraft's altitude, EGPWS issued a ``caution terrain''
alert, and the display automatically changed from 80-mile scale to 10-mile
scale. The gently rising terrain leading to the ridge triggered the caution
alert at three miles (about one minute away), and the corresponding
elevation blocks on the screen were displayed in bright yellow. Shortly
thereafter, the reactive GPWS function also alerted us to the impending
hazard. A gentle pull on the yoke and an increase in power resulted in our
safely climbing above the hazard.
   After clearing the ridge, we switched to 80-mile scale and started a
gentle turn. We were impressed with EGPWS' ability to ``look ahead'' to
distant terrain such as 10,560-feet-high Glacier Peak. This summit was
displayed as blocks of red on the screen because its relative elevation was
more than 2,000 feet above the aircraft's altitude.
   The most impressive feature of the system, though, was its ability to
provide a timely terrain-hazard alert as we approached the sharply rising
Three Fingers peak due east of Arlington, Washington. As we flew to within
seven miles of Three Fingers, EGPWS anticipated the impending hazard. The
aural alert sounded ``caution, terrain'' and the threat display on the
moving map illuminated the hazardous terrain elevation in a bright yellow
block.
   We intentionally pressed closer, causing EGPWS to twice sound ``Terrain
ahead. Pull up!'' The display automatically changed to 10-mile scale, and
the appropriate terrain elevation blocks turned bright red.
   We pulled up only enough to clear the peak by a legal 500 feet and just
after clearing it, the reactive GPWS function-the one mandated by the FAA
for airliners-warned us with a ``Terrain! Terrain!'' alert. If we had been
depending upon reactive GPWS alone for terrain avoidance, we would have
never heard the warning, and the NTSB would have sifted through the
fragments looking for accident clues.
   EGPWS will be standard equipment on the Gulfstream V, and several
airlines are upgrading to the system. The system, though, provides a
large-scale improvement in situational awareness that will attract the
attention of many other aircraft manufacturers and business-aircraft
operators.
   EGPWS currently is priced at $59,233, which is close to twice the cost
of standard ground prox boxes. Its ability to anticipate terrain hazards,
however, and its virtual immunity to ``cry-wolf'' false alarms are a
quantum technological leap over current generation GPWS.

JET SUPPORT EMS PROGRAM (PAGE 72)
Once considered an upstart, JSSI is making inroads as the only independent
in the power-by-the-hour game.

By:
Perry Bradley

   It wasn't so long ago that mention of Jet Support Services, Incorporated
would most likely have met with a resounding, ``Who?''
Not so these days. Since its launch in 1989, JSSI of Chicago has steadily
added customers and says its portfolio of powerplants in the Engine
Maintenance Systems (EMS) program-the only independent engine-maintenance
program in the corporate marketplace-will top 500 in the first quarter of
this year.
   As with programs offered through original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), operators pay a fixed fee into the EMS kitty based on the number of
hours they fly. In exchange, JSSI pays for scheduled and unscheduled
maintenance. In practice, the programs are slightly more complicated, but
they essentially allow operators to dial in hourly operating costs and
insure themselves against maintenance hits that are not in the budget.
   JSSI's strategy for penetrating the often skeptical corporate-aviation
market is forthright and logical: Offer more-flexible programs than the
competitors', offer them at favorable rates, and stay focused on customer
service. And according to operators we polled, the company is succeeding on
all fronts.

SAFETY NET
   The company provided B/CA with a complete list of its customers from
which we sampled a selection of operators, being careful to poll from all
areas of the country and from operators of various engines for which EMS is
offered. Operators ranged from a large Fortune 500 company with 11 aircraft
in the fleet to single-aircraft operators. Aircraft ranged from a Sikorsky
S-76 to Gulfstream IVs.
   Overall, the opinion of the program was very favorable. ``On a scale of
one to 10, the lowest mark I'd give them in any category would be a nine,''
commented one Falcon 10 operator.
   Most operators said they view EMS as a financial-planning tool that
provides stable budgeting, even though many said they feel the program, in
the long run, costs more than self-insuring. ``The CFO likes an insurance
program,'' said one. ``From a cash-flow point of view, I can't argue
that.''
   Operators rated customer support as high, and most said they planned to
renew at the end of their five-year terms and would recommend the program
to a colleague. The criticism most often voiced was that JSSI's expertise
is deeper in finance than it is in technical support.
   One of the hallmarks of JSSI's program is flexibility. Unlike OEM
programs, JSSI will insure virtually any engine. (See accompanying chart.)
Service is available at any factory-authorized service center. Although
AlliedSignal TFE731s make up nearly 75 percent of the enrolled engines,
JSSI also covers everything from Allison 250 helicopter engines to
Rolls-Royce Speys and Tays. Mixed-fleet operators said the ability to use
only one source to cover all their engines was a major attraction.
   The company also offers operators a variety of buy-in options as an
enticement to add airplanes to the program. Although the portfolio includes
some new aircraft, many of the aircraft are added to the program at resale,
either by brokers or by new owners. According to JSSI President Rick
Haskins, the typical customer is the second owner of an airplane that was
not originally on an engine program, or it is an operator upgrading to jet
equipment for the first time.
   However, some operators with new aircraft are on the program. During the
warranty period, JSSI covers all scheduled maintenance, and picks up
coverage of unscheduled maintenance when the warranty expires. Because JSSI
requires operators to use factory-authorized service centers, warranty
coverage isn't affected by the program. On some engines, operators pay a
reduced rate during their warranty period.
   Several operators we talked with put used aircraft on the program just
after buying them. The enrollment fee ranges from $15,000 to $25,000 for
used aircraft; brand-new aircraft can be enrolled for $2,500. JSSI also
requires a ``Pre-Induction Diagnostic Survey''-a thorough examination of
the engine that runs about $2,500 for each powerplant.
   JSSI lets operators buy into the program with either a lump sum that
brings the engine up to date on the program, or through a pro-rata program.
While one operator did a 100-percent buy-in, most said a major attraction
was JSSI's lower enrollment price through the pro-rata program.
   Many operators said they opted for EMS because the buy-in was far
cheaper than for competing OEM programs. The competitor most often
mentioned was AlliedSignal's Maintenance Service Plan. (See
``AlliedSignal's Maintenance Service Plan,'' B/CA, March 1995, page 52.) A
broker that routinely puts TFE731-powered aircraft on engine programs said
he shops between MSP and EMS, and ``JSSI wins virtually every time. The
pro-rate makes JSSI more attractive.''
   The pro-rata program is set up as follows: JSSI and the operator share
the cost of the first of each subsequent scheduled event based on the
number of hours on the aircraft when enrolled. For example, if an aircraft
has been flown 1,000 hours and has a 2,500-hour hot-section inspection
interval and a 5,000-hour overhaul limit, the operator would pay 40 percent
of the first hot section, and 20 percent of the overhaul. The pro-rate also
applies to any cycle-limited parts. JSSI covers 100 percent of all
unscheduled maintenance once the contract is inked.
   About half of the operators with whom we spoke added aircraft to EMS at
the time of purchase. Most said the process was straightforward. However,
one operator said he ended up with some confusion over who would pay for
service bulletins. That operator, who flies a Lear 35, said in addition to
his approximately $100,000 pro-rata share of his first major periodic
inspection (MPI), he also had to spend about $16,000 extra per engine on
service bulletins. Another said he ended up paying more for cycle-limited
components than he thought he would have to pay.
   JSSI's policy is to pay for all mandatory or recommended service
bulletins from the date the contract is signed, says Haskins. However,
operators are responsible for any bulletins that pre-date the contract. In
the event an optional bulletin is upgraded to recommended or mandatory
after the contract is signed, JSSI shares the cost on a pro-rated basis.
   Another operator with whom we spoke said he had run into a Catch-22 when
buying a used Westwind. The previous owner was about 35-percent behind on
his payments to JSSI. The prospective buyer said his options amounted to
either paying the back balance, or letting the original contract drop and
re-enrolling the aircraft-a much pricier option.
   Haskins said he wasn't aware of the particular circumstance, but said
owners are required to notify JSSI in advance of a sale, and must have
accounts paid in full before transferring their coverage. Starting January
1, 1995, JSSI instituted a new policy that penalizes late payments, and EMS
contracts stipulate that falling behind in payments can be construed as
breach of contract. Still, if you're considering buying an airplane on EMS,
it's a good idea to make sure JSSI has been notified and that the account
is current.

OEM INDEPENDENCE
   Another major attraction to EMS is its independence from the engine
manufacturer, according to many of the operators. ``I was hell-bent on not
going with another factory program,'' said a Lear 60 operator who had a
Lear 35 on MSP and shopped EMS versus Pratt & Whitney's factory program for
the PW305 when the flight department got the new airplane. ``I just feel
better with a neutral party.''
   Several operators said they sense an inherent conflict of interest in
having the factory also manage maintenance of their engines. One complaint
often voiced was that money paid for factory-sponsored programs seems to
subsidize repairs to the entire fleet of engines. For instance, ADs often
are paid for by the OEM, regardless of whether an engine is covered or
not.
   Still, independence wasn't a virtue for all the customers. One Lear 35
chief pilot who currently is on EMS said his first preference would be to
forego the program altogether and self-insure by setting aside reserves.
But if he had to pick a maintenance program, he would prefer to go with the
OEM. Asked why, he said, ``JSSI's sole purpose is to make money.''
The financial aspect of the arrangement generated a lot of comments.
Operators were nearly unanimous in describing EMS as primarily a financial
program, and a good one at that. However, on the technical side, there was
a stark difference of opinion.
   ``As a financial tool set, it rates a 10 out of 10, but on the technical
side, they're pretty weak,'' said one operator with a fleet of aircraft on
the program. ``I'd like to be able to just call and say it's broken and
hang up.'' Instead, he said he finds himself as involved in maintenance as
he would be if his company were self insured. Another operator said he
thinks of JSSI as offering a clerical function.
   Haskins says he's aware of the perception that the company is more
financial than technical. He and Marla Rabin, vice president for
administration and finance, worked together in investment banking before
launching JSSI in 1989, with what he concedes was a limited background in
aviation. One of the company's goals for this year is to hire more
technical staff.
   The technical component of JSSI is run by Karl Florian, who joined the
company two years ago after a career with the Xerox flight department.
Approximately 15 contractors work with JSSI in the field, representing the
company at various maintenance shops where clients take engines for
service. Rep-resentatives are routinely dispatched to oversee major
scheduled events.
   For unscheduled work, the severity of the problem dictates whether a
field rep is dispatched or not.
   ``We're very happy with our technical staff, but I think we need to put
more people in the field,'' says Haskins. ``The ideal guy shows up in his
suit and tie, but in his trunk he also has a pair of coveralls.''
   While some of those surveyed said the technical side was weak, others
complained that it was too much a presence. Because it is an independent
engine maintenance company, JSSI acts as a middle man between the operator
and the service facility. The company sends a representative to oversee
scheduled maintenance as well as major unscheduled events.
   One operator complained that getting pre-authorization from JSSI seemed
inevitably to result in delays. However, another said that JSSI's
involvement speeded the process. A Falcon 10 operator said parts shortages
threatened to add significantly to downtime on an overhaul, but ``JSSI beat
the bushes, found the parts, and got my engine going again.''
A chief of maintenance at a company with a Westwind in charter service
offered an interesting perspective. ``They'll slow a job down, but the
other extreme is people who view factory programs as a blank check.'' Prior
to joining the flight department, he worked with a maintenance facility
that did a considerable chunk of work on factory-covered engines. He said
he felt that oftentimes new parts were installed where repaired or reworked
parts would have been more cost effective. ``It's kind of like health
care,'' he said. ``When an insurer is paying $10 for Band-Aids, that drives
the cost up for everyone. JSSI really keeps the costs down.''

IN THE TRENCHES
When it comes to actually getting work done, operators rate JSSI's service
as excellent. Virtually all had undergone scheduled maintenance, and many
of the operators also had needed to call on JSSI in an emergency. In one
case, an operator had an AOG at a remote Nevada airport on a weekend. ``I
was in a conference call with JSSI and a maintenance facility within 10
minutes,'' he said. ``If I was an independent and not on an insurance
program, I wouldn't have known where to start calling.''
   Another operator had his first experience with the program even before
buying an airplane. During a pre-purchase inspection, an engine facility
noted vibration that was close to being outside specifications. The
previous owner called JSSI, which authorized a fan balance. ``I'm really
impressed with them,'' the subsequent purchaser said. ``I became
comfortable with them immediately.''
   One operator with whom we spoke said he was new to the program and had
just 1,700 hours (in relation to a 4,500-hour overhaul limit) on his
engines, but was experiencing chronic temperature problems on one side. A
service facility eventually recommended an overhaul. ``JSSI said no
problem,'' he says. Another operator needed work done in the core of his
engine some 1,000 hours before the stipulated overhaul limit. JSSI not only
backed the work, but also encouraged him to go ahead with the full
overhaul. ``What JSSI did really gave me a favorable opinion. They jumped
in and agreed to pay for lots of extra things that weren't in the
contract,'' he said. ``They just kept making it a better deal.''
   Asked about ``fine-print'' issues, few operators had any complaints.
``Where there's a gray area, they seem to come down on the operator's
side,'' said one. One operator noted that his company's legal staff
reviewed JSSI's contract prior to signing up, and returned it to the flight
department without any recommended changes.
   None of the operators said they had any trouble with the paperwork
aspects of the program. JSSI supplies forms that are filled out monthly.
Operators simply fill in the blanks, multiplying the hours flown by the
hourly fee to arrive at the total due for the month. On most of the engines
it covers, JSSI also pays for operators to participate in trend-monitoring
programs.

RESALE BOOSTER
   In addition to the claimed benefit they derive while on the program,
many operators said they feel JSSI also pays dividends when it comes time
to sell their aircraft.
   Brokers say that aircraft on engine programs tend to sell faster and
often for more money than non-covered aircraft. And aircraft value guides
give additional credit for aircraft that have engines on insurance
programs. The amount of the credit ranges from the value of a single
overhaul to treating the engines as though they were zero-time.
   Fletcher Aldredge, publisher of the Vref Aircraft Value Reference, said
JSSI is gaining acceptance in the marketplace, and that awareness of the
program is increasing. ``Anything new has a major sell job, but EMS is
definitely one of the services that's gaining acceptance,'' he said.
   Several operators who had purchased used aircraft confirmed that the
airplane's having been on
an engine program was a factor in their decision. ``I wanted to get an
airplane that was on a program especially because it was our first jet,''
said one.
   JSSI's flexibility extends to resale. Operators can leave the program
with the airplane, presumably recovering some of their cost in the
transaction. The transfer fee is $2,500. However, operators also can sell
their aircraft without the coverage, retaining their reserves for
application on a new aircraft.
   ``What we're doing here is leaving the dollars with the flight
department,'' says Haskins. ``It allows the flight department to make
productive choices about how they want to use their assets.''
   If the engine coverage is retained, JSSI gives the operator use of the
reserves paid into the program, minus the company's monthly management fee
and any money already expended on maintenance. The remaining balance can be
applied toward the buy-in for another aircraft or for hourly operating
fees. However, operators cannot opt for a cash rebate.
   JSSI has come a long way in six years. While it's still a small company,
its acceptance and list of clients is growing. A key company focus is
service. ``We want to serve our customers like they are treated in a
mom-and-pop type of shop as opposed to having them feel like they're just a
number,'' said JSSI's Marla Rabin. ``We want to grow, but we want to have
the mentality of a small company.''
   So far, the strategy appears to be working. Said one operator,
``Whenever you tell your boss to invest this kind of money, you want
assurance you've done the right thing. After a year and a half on the
program, I'm sure we did the right thing.''

JSSI LANDS A BIG ONE
   Business JetSolutions, the joint venture between Bombardier and AMR
Combs, recently contracted with JSSI for coverage of its FlexJet
fractional-ownership aircraft.
   JetSolutions compared JSSI's EMS program with OEM programs and
self-insuring, concluding it was cheaper than the OEM options and only
slightly more expensive than socking away reserves, according to Dennis
Keith, vice president of marketing and sales. ``We did an analysis on
engine costs and reserves, and the marginal difference in cost, compared to
what JSSI can do it for was just not worth the hassle,'' says Keith. ``It
boils down to a small insurance premium.''
   Another factor in selecting EMS, Keith said, is having just one vendor
that covers JetSolution's entire fleet, which includes General Electric
CF34s on the Challengers, Pratt & Whitney Canada PW305s on the Lear 60s and
AlliedSignal TFE731-2s on the Lear 31As. Finally, JetSolutions felt the
programs would increase resale value of the aircraft shares, providing
owners with higher residual value.
   JetSolution's initial fleet includes 14 aircraft. As of mid-November
1995, the company said its customer base was ``well into the double
digits.'' As part of the JSSI agreement, aircraft owners in JetSolutions'
Alliance Plus management arm also receive discounts on EMS enrollment fees
and hourly rates.

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
   Rick Haskins and Marla Rabin were working in the investment-banking
business when they were approached with the idea of starting an independent
engine-maintenance program in late 1988. A couple of months later they
rented office space; and a year after that, they signed their first
client.
   ``We kind of wanted to try something on our own to see if all this
advice we'd been dispensing really worked,'' Haskins says modestly. ``So we
just did it.''
   Haskins serves as president of JSSI, while Rabin is vice president for
administration and finance. The third founder was Ron Zilberbrand, who
heads up the sales effort. Early on, the company was regarded as ``kind of
cute,'' Haskins says. Now, it's taken a little more seriously-both by OEMs
and by operators shopping for protection against unscheduled maintenance
expense.
   ``Our market is anybody with any budget sensitivity, whether it's a huge
Fortune 500 company or a little guy who's a charter operator,'' says
Haskins. ``Budget sensitivity is the critical path.''
   One of the unique aspects about JSSI is its ability to cover virtually
any turbine engine. While AlliedSignal TFE731s make up the bulk of its
portfolio, the company covers 17 different engine types, including
everything from Turbomeca and Allison helicopter engines to Pratt & Whitney
Canada PT-6s to P&WC JT15s and AlliedSignal APUs.
   How can the company handle so many engine types? For one, Director of
Technical Services Karl Florian does extensive research with operators,
OEMs and service facilities to help set hourly rates. However, just as
important, Haskins and Rabin say, is the company's basic structure. ``If
you have the management systems and management techniques in place, there
shouldn't be any reason in the turbine world why you shouldn't be able to
handle an engine,'' says Haskins. The company also recently announced a
joint venture with Stevens Aviation that will provide nose-to-tail coverage
of King Air 200s for a base rate of $390 per hour (B/CA, November 1995,
page 28).
   JSSI makes its money from enrollment fees-$2,500 for a brand-new
aircraft and a range of about $15,000 to $25,000 for used aircraft-and from
extracting a management fee from the hourly charge that clients pay for
engine operations. However, the remainder of the monthly fee goes into a
trust that exists outside JSSI's corporate structure. JSSI can't spend the
money for corporate purposes, nor does it derive any interest income from
the third-party irrevocable trust, which is administered by LaSalle
National Bank. The company is authorized to spend money only for engine
repair and maintenance, and carries an insurance policy that backs up the
trust.
   Haskins and Rabin attribute the company's success to the flexibility of
its programs and to a strong customer-service orientation. So far,
operators of some 500 engines seem to agree, and the company is
experiencing a perfect renewal record as the first of its five-year
contracts begin to run out.
   The strategy for the future is to continue to grow without forgetting
what got them where they are today. ``The worry we have is how far and how
fast we can expand without losing what got us here, and what got us here is
customer advocacy,'' says Rabin.

SAAB 2000 EXECUTIVE SHUTTLE
One of the fastest production turboprop airliners flies 36 people at
near-jetliner speeds.

By:
Fred George

   Saab 5123L, confirm that you are a turboprop,'' inquired a Washington
Center controller on the day we flew the Saab 2000. His inflection was
unmistakable: ``Aren't you actually a jet?'' We imagined that he thumped
his aging computer console a couple of times, trying to clear its digital
cobwebs, as he watched us climb out of Dulles at 240 KIAS. At 37,000
pounds, the Saab 2000 admittedly was well below its 50,260 pounds MTOW,
with only a few passengers on board. The relatively light weight, however,
doesn't discount the Saab 2000's performance accomplishments.
   The climb to FL 310 took 19 minutes from brake release, which is
respectable for a high-performance turboprop. However, without ATC delays,
we would have reached that flight level in 16 minutes-more like the average
jetliner. After one minute at FL 310 in ISA+4C conditions, the Saab 2000
settled into a 368 KTAS cruise while burning 1,920 pph.
   After level off, we had to pull back the power levers to avoid pushing
through the 0.62 Mach Mmo red barber pole on the primary flight display.
There was plenty of energy remaining in the engines, with the power levers
in the max-cruise position.
   Saab's recipe for spirited climb performance and jet-like cruise speed
is a classic, three-part blend: lean fuselage cross section,
high-aspect-ratio wing and huge turbine engines. The fuselage cross section
is taken from the Saab 340, but it is stretched 24 feet overall, resulting
in 20.67 feet more cabin length for the passengers, and up to 120 cubic
feet more baggage volume depending on interior configuration. The wing,
which is a scaled up version of the one on the Saab 340, retains its 11:1
aspect ratio and relatively thick chord section.
   Most of the credit for the performance gains, though, goes to the
Rolls-Royce Allison AE2100A turboprop engines which, at their 3,770-shp
normal takeoff rating, offer twice the power of the Saab 340's General
Electric CT7 engines, and even more at their 4,152-shp APR rating. Notably,
both normal and APR horsepower ratings are available up to 36C (97F).

LONG LEGS, SHORT HOPS
   When needed, the Saab 2000 Executive Shuttle can fly 36 passengers 1,289
nm with NBAA IFR reserves, at an average cruise speed of 360 KTAS,
according to the aircraft operations manual (AOM). Slow down to a
long-range cruise speed of 280 KTAS and, if needed, you could fly more than
1,600 nm.
   Most missions, however, are likely to be in the 200- to 400-nm range,
based on the projections of the one Executive Shuttle operator in the
United States and the experience of Switzerland's Crossair, which now has
amassed more than 55,000 flight hours in the Saab 2000.
   Short-haul missions and density-altitude performance are the Saab 2000's
strong suits. In comparison to the Canadair RJ, the Saab 2000 burns three
percent less fuel on a 300-nm trip, but it is only seven minutes slower.
The Saab 2000's fuel economy advantage, compared to the Canadair RJ's,
disappears with longer-range trips, and its slower speed results in
noticeably longer trip times.
   The corporate operator with whom we spoke (wishing to remain anonymous)
said the company looked at other 36-seat aircraft, but all were slower than
the 295 KTAS cruise-speed turboprops they currently fly. The operator
estimates that the Saab 2000 will burn one-third less fuel and offer a
75-knot speed advantage, compared to its current shuttle aircraft. The firm
selected the Saab 2000 because it will save them 10 minutes to 20 minutes
per leg, compared to any other 36-seat turboprop. The flight department
ruled out a 50-passenger regional jet because of longer runway requirements
and higher operating costs for its average 200-nm mission.
   Fuel economy favors a jetliner-like climb/cruise/descent profile because
it saves as much as 20 percent in fuel consumption. For example, the Saab
2000 can fly 36 passengers 200 nm in 47 minutes with a block fuel burn of
1,450 pounds, according to the AOM. Flying the aircraft anywhere between
13,000 feet and FL 310 on such trips makes less than a one-minute
difference in trip times.
   Hot-and-high airport conditions impose virtually no limitations on the
Saab 2000. It can carry substantially more payload and fly longer legs with
maximum payload compared to the Canadair RJ, especially when departing from
high-density altitude airfields.
   For example, when using the 3,770-shp normal takeoff power (NTOP) rating
and a no-flaps configuration, the Saab 2000 can depart Denver at 38C (100F)
with 36 people and full fuel. The APU, however, must be used for cabin
pressurization during NTOP departures because the engine bleeds are shut
off. (Using reduced, ``flex'' power for takeoff allows the engine bleeds to
be turned on.)
   Crossair's experience with the Saab 2000 provides potential corporate
operators with a credible gauge of the aircraft's day-in and day-out
performance. The Swiss carrier's average trip is 400 nm, and the average
block time is 1+15, according to Thomas Brandt, Crossair's Saab 2000 fleet
chief. He told B/CA that when the Saab 2000 flies at FL 290 to 310, it
cruises at 355 to 365 KTAS, depending on temperature aloft, and that the
block fuel burn for such trips is 2,400 pounds. Crossair also flies the
aircraft on 800- to 1,000-nm charters, such as between Basel, Switzerland
and the Greek Islands, and between Berlin and St. Petersburg, Russia.

PASSENGER ACCOMMODATIONS
   Travelers accustomed to coach seats on jetliners will find slightly more
seat width on the Saab 2000. The cabin seats are 18.1 inches wide on the
right, two-seat side and 18.5 inches wide on the left, single-seat side,
providing about one-half to one inch more width than the average coach
seat. The fuselage's circular shape and its 7.1-foot interior cross
section, however, offer less shoulder room in the window seats than the
comparatively vertical side walls of most jetliners.
   The Executive Shuttle's 36-seat configuration provides the 24 rear
passengers a 34-inch seat pitch, making possible three club-seating
sections in the forward section and resulting in one inch less seat pitch
in the front section.
   The aircraft we flew for this report was completed by AIM Aviation,
Limited of Bournemouth, England. It had leather-covered, fold-out work
tables for passengers in two of the club sections, and fold-down tray
tables for forward-facing seats in the aft cabin. A conventional FAA Type I
entrance is located at the left front of the fuselage for passenger
boarding. A folding boarding ladder, with its operation aided by counter
springs, slides into the passenger door opening from a storage compartment
aft of the cockpit. There is another Type I door at the right rear side of
the aircraft for galley servicing. Left- and right-side Type III emergency
exits are located at mid cabin.
   A single lavatory is located in the forward section of the cabin. Just
aft, there is a 104-cubic-foot carryon storage compartment on the right
side and a 39-cubic-foot coat closet on the left side. The Executive
Shuttle, in contrast to the airliner configuration, has no overhead luggage
compartments adjacent to the passenger seats.
   The aft galley has storage for hot and cold meal service for one serving
to 36 passengers, plus hot and cold beverage storage.
   In the rear section of the pressure vessel, 328 cubic feet of baggage
volume are available in two compartments that are accessible on the ground
by means of a 53-by-51-inch cargo door, and in flight through a door in the
galley area. The aft baggage compartments have a capacity of 2,756 pounds.
(Weight and balance data for the aircraft were not available when we flew
the aircraft, thus we could not check if loading the aft compartment to
capacity would adversely affect the center of gravity under certain
conditions.)

ACTIVE NOISE ATTENUATION
   The Saab 2000's six-blade, Dowty Rotol props turn at only 950 rpm in all
phases of flight other than takeoff. Then, they turn at a modest 1,100 rpm.
Each prop, though, converts enough torque to thrust to propel the Saab 2000
to nearly six miles per minute in cruise.
   Saab uses a combination of dynamic vibration absorbers, acoustical
insulation and an active noise cancellation system to blot up noise and
vibration, with the goal of achieving 76 dBA interior sound levels. While
the active and passive systems are effective, Crossair claims that the
cabin sound level actually is 78 dBA, which exceeds the manufacturer's
specification for the aircraft. Saab is developing an improved sound
attenuation system for the aircraft that will be fitted to the 2000 at a
later date (B/CA, September 1995, page 122).

POWER VERSUS STABILITY AND CONTROL
   The Saab 2000, being the most powerful turboprop ever built by Saab
Aircraft, posed some unique challenges during development that ultimately
led to a one-year delay in certification. Joint Airworthiness Authority
sign-off occurred in March 1994, and the FAA certificated the aircraft in
April 1994. The first production aircraft was delivered to Crossair in
August 1994, but it had c.g.-envelope limitations and performance
shortfalls that were corrected in later production aircraft.
   Saab anticipated considerable directional control forces in the event of
an engine failure, thus it elected to fit the Saab 2000 with a
rudder-by-wire system to help control yaw. Early in 1992, though, Saab's
flight-test engineers also found shortcomings in longitudinal stability, so
they widened the chord of the horizontal stabilizer by seven percent. Saab
originally planned to use a manually operated mechanical elevator control
system (MECS). By mid 1993, however, it became apparent that MECS
limitations would restrict the center of gravity envelope, or ``loadability
range'' as termed by Saab. In addition, the pitch forces associated with
MECS would be considerable, especially at high speeds.
   At that point in the development program, Saab elected to fit the 2000
with a fly-by-wire powered elevator control system, PECS for short, that is
linked to a digital flight-control computer. PECS, similar to fly-by-wire
systems fitted to fighters, allows aerodynamic stability requirements to be
relaxed, thereby permitting the c.g. envelope to be extended by 50 percent,
according to Saab.
   PECS uses a belt-and-braces design for redundancy, including left- and
right-side, dual-channel flight-control computers. These computers provide
the appropriate control-yoke-to-elevator movement, which is geared to
indicated airspeed, along with flap-position trim bias, speed and Mach
pitch trim, and g-force loading. The pitch-trim function is built into the
PECS computers. There is no elevator trim tab. The system greatly reduces
the pitch-control forces because it uses springs for artificial control
feel rather than aerodynamic control surface feedback.
   The spring loaded, artificial pitch-feel system suggests that
pitch-control feel might be numb. Such is not the case. In our opinion,
however, the stick forces seem nicely proportionate throughout most of the
flight envelope because of the pitch-control law fidelity programmed into
the fly-by-wire computer.
   The muscle to move the left and right elevators is provided by two
hydraulic actuators on each side, powered by three independent hydraulic
systems. Pitch control is retained in the event of two out of three
hydraulic system failures or jamming of either the right or left elevator.
In addition, a hydraulic-actuated, emergency-pitch-trim actuator is
connected to the left elevator in case both dual-channel PECS computers
simultaneously fail.
   P-factor is another challenge. Pilots flying the Saab 2000 will have no
difficulty in identifying the left powerplant as the critical engine,
because of the clockwise prop rotation of both engines. The fly-by-wire
rudder system all but eliminates yaw control problems, even when one is
flying the aircraft with one-engine-inoperative. However, manual roll
control makes power-induced roll trim changes quite noticeable.
   Vmca, as a result, is defined more by roll-control limitations than by
rudder authority. Saab intends to reduce Vmca by fitting vortex generators
(VGs) to the leading edges of the ailerons. The VGs will be hidden from the
air flow except when the ailerons are deflected to large angles, thereby
eliminating any drag penalty in cruise. The upgrade will be available by
the middle of this year.
   Counter-rotating props might seem an obvious solution. Saab told B/CA,
however, that such a change would be expensive to engineer, plus both the
engine gear box and the propeller assemblies would be left- or right-side
specific, thus requiring two sets of spares in inventory.
   In our opinion, however, the Saab 2000 would benefit from
counter-rotating propellers because of its prodigious horsepower and large
prop diameter.

SYSTEMS DESIGN
   Other systems reflect Saab's compulsion for rugged construction and
dispatch reliability, about which Crossair had good things to say. With few
exceptions (such as dual nav lights) design emphasis is on component
reliability rather than component redundancy.
   The airframe has a 60,000-hour/75,000-cycle design life and a 24-month
warranty. Other components are warranted for at least 24 months, with a
30-month warranty on the Dowty Rotol propellers and a 36-month warranty on
the engines.
   Avionics and other systems are well integrated for diagnostic functions.
(See sidebar). Many of the normal and abnormal procedures, including most
preflight checks, are automated to reduce pilot workload.
   Engines and propellers are controlled by FADECs for low pilot workload
and high reliability. (See sidebar.) The Sundstrand APU is certificated for
inflight operations, and it starts automatically in the event of an engine
failure. Its three-phase, wild frequency 45kVr AC generator is identical to
generators on the engines, and it can power all electrical equipment. Most
electrical systems are DC-powered-supplied by three transformer rectifier
units. The APU is required for dispatch because it's used to supply bleed
air to start the engines.
   The fuel system, similar to the Saab 340's, uses wet-wing fuel tanks
with cross-feed, single-point pressure refueling (15 minutes maximum) and
gravity fill functions. Extendable sight gauges in the bottom of the tanks
allow the crew to crosscheck fuel quantity on preflight without having to
use dipsticks. The fuel-boost pumps are located in dry canisters that allow
removal and replacement without defueling.
   Three hydraulic systems powered by engine-driven and/or electric pumps
supply pressure to actuate the landing gear, wing flaps, wheel brakes,
nosewheel steering and fly-by-wire rudder and elevator. The standby pumps
are located in the wing root fairings for easy access.
   Bleed air is used for engine anti-ice, to inflate the deice boots on the
leading edges of the wings and empennage, and to supply the dual air-cycle
machines. Electric power is used for prop, probe and windshield anti-ice
heat. Rain removal is by windshield wipers.

PRICE AND VALUE
   The B/CA Comparison Profile compares the Saab 2000 to a composite
average that encompasses the Saab along with the de Havilland Dash 8-300,
Fokker 50EX and Canadair RJ. The named aircraft are all able to seat 50
people in airliner configuration. (The Dornier 328-110 was not included
because its cabin is smaller than other competitors'.)
The Saab 2000 scores well on the B/CA Comparison Profile, racking up
first-place or second-place scores in 16 of 24 categories, including the
price index in which it has a seven-percent advantage.
   The aircraft carries more payload, and it carries it a longer distance
than any competitor does. Clearly, it is the fastest 50-seat turboprop
certificated for civil use. No other aircraft in the $14-million price
range carries so many people, so far and so fast. Only the seven-passenger
Piaggio P180 Avanti, for example, is faster-and it is out of production.
   Although the Saab 2000 isn't as fast as a 30-seat Corporate RJ, nor does
it burn as little fuel during a 1,000-mile trip, it is at least $5-million
less expensive to buy than any jetliner of similar capacity.
   Also, the Saab 2000 is one of the quietest turboprops in production, but
passengers won't confuse it for a jetliner-at least not at present.
   The Saab 2000 Executive Shuttle offers the most advanced avionics suite
of any 36-seat corporate shuttle, provides highly automated systems for
reduced flightcrew workload, and brings the ability to operate out of
3,400-foot runways on typical 200-nm trips.
   Hot-and-high airport conditions impose few takeoff weight limitations on
the Saab 2000. It's the only aircraft in the Comparison Profile that can
depart from 5,000 feet on a 25C day at maximum takeoff weight.
   As scheduled airline service continues to atrophy (the result of less
profitable routes being abandoned), corporate-shuttle aircraft become more
attractive to dozens of companies with remote plants and subsidiaries. With
speed and interior sound levels approaching those of a jet, short field
performance that is competitive with other turboprops' and virtually
unrestricted hot-and-high performance, the Saab 2000 provides one of the
best alternatives to chartering an airliner full time.

FLYING IMPRESSIONS
   With the exception of its aircraft flight manual (AFM) and the
two-volume AOM, the Saab 2000 offers more ease-of-use features for pilots
than the competitive aircraft.
   These three tomes should be carried on the aircraft because of the
paucity of information provided by the AFM alone. The FAA-approved AFM, for
example, lacks step-by-step emergency procedures needed for continuing a
takeoff in the event of an engine failure just after V1. Those vital steps
are contained in the non-FAA-approved AOM.
   In our opinion, the checklist-as an extension of the AFM-is equally
incomplete with respect to procedures. The AOM provides both technical
description of the systems and amplified procedures needed for certain
emergency and abnormal conditions.
   No set of aircraft manuals that we can remember dilutes procedural
information over so many pages of text.
   Once strapped into the cockpit, though, pilots will find plenty of
well-thought-out automation to ease the workload. A clearance-delivery
feature, for example, powers the right radio-tuning unit and VHF com 2
transceiver from the center battery bus. Start the APU, and power is
automatically supplied to the avionics. The FMS provides the cabin-pressure
controller with the destination field elevation.
   However, the current production Collins FMS 4100 is limited. It stores
only two flight plans. There are no provisions for weight calculations and/
or fuel-flow predictions. The TSO C129 A2 GPS only is authorized for en
route and terminal operations.
   The APU supplies plenty of bleed air through the dual air-cycle machines
to quickly heat or cool the cabin. Our calculated V-speeds for a
41,000-pound takeoff weight, including full fuel and three passengers, were
116 knots for takeoff decision and rotation speeds, and 122 for the takeoff
safety speed-within two knots of the Vmc limited takeoff V-speeds. After
engine start, we quickly moved the condition levers from the ``start''
position (in which the 12.5-foot, six-blade props remain feathered) to the
770 rpm, ground idle ``run'' position. This was done to reduce buffeting
and vibration in the cabin.
   Our computed takeoff distance was 3,450 feet. After aligning the
aircraft on the runway, we pushed the takeoff/go-around mode annunciator
and then advanced the power levers to the detent. Engine response was
decidedly crisp, and the aircraft surged forward with an initial
acceleration that few civil aircraft can match.
   Pitch force with PECS was light and well balanced, but roll control was
heavy in comparison, significantly detracting from control harmony. Power
changes produced quite noticeable roll changes, requiring aileron inputs
and roll-trim changes.
   Our initial rate of climb was 2,500 fpm at 190 KIAS. We lowered the nose
for better forward visibility and accelerated to 240 KIAS. Twelve minutes
later, including pauses for ATC restrictions, we passed through FL 180 with
a climb rate of 1,700 fpm. Again because of ATC restrictions, our initial
cruise altitude was FL 250, which we reached in 13 minutes with a total
fuel burn of 980 pounds. We accelerated to 365 KTAS in ISA+6C conditions
with a fuel burn of 2,150 pph.
   Later, we were cleared to climb to FL 310, reaching it 19 minutes after
departure. Using 62-percent power, we accelerated to 370 KTAS while burning
2,040 pph in ISA+5C conditions. Total fuel burn for the climb was 1.390
pounds. At that point, we had to reduce power to avoid exceeding the 0.62
Mmo redline.
   Steep turns in the Saab 2000 bring out a little numbness in the PECS
pitch feel, but in normal maneuvering the fly-by-wire system has a natural,
proportionate feel. Recovery from clean and dirty stalls is aided by a
stick-pusher system. Holding the stick back after the stick pusher fires
results in a gentle left-wing roll off because of P-factor, even at flight
idle.
   Simulated OEI conditions bring out the Saab 2000's unique handling
characteristics. Directional control requires very little rudder pedal
input because of the rudder-by-wire system. Roll control through the manual
ailerons, though, requires more of an iron fist approach, especially at
slow speeds and high power settings. Once the aircraft accelerates to 160
KIAS or power is reduced, roll control forces become greatly reduced, and
they are easily counteracted with roll trim.
   Our computed landing distance, based on a 37,000-pound arrival weight,
was 3,700 feet with a 112- KIAS Vref, based on Vmo limits. The aerodynamic
Vref, based on 1.3 Vso speed, was 107 KIAS.
   Landing the aircraft requires some finesse because of its comparatively
stiff struts. After touchdown, we pulled the power levers back to flight
idle, then up and over into the ground-idle position. Pulling the levers
back farther against spring tension activates reverse thrust, which is
effective in slowing the aircraft on slippery surfaces.
   Our total fuel burn for the 1+07, 333-nm, great-circle-distance trip was
2,790 pounds.

ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON AE2 100 ENGINES
   Few turboprop engines can match the dispatch reliability, fuel
efficiency and digital-control sophistication of the AE2100. The prop
gearbox, adapted from the venerable T56 engine that powers the U.S. Navy
Grumman E2C and P3C Orion, has a 30,000-hour mean time between repair. The
gas generator, shared with the AAS3007 turbofan, is sized for 6,000-shp
applications. As a result, the gas generator has a 125C temperature margin
for the AE2100C at its normal takeoff power rating of 3,770 shp.
   The 14-stage, axial flow compressor has variable inlet guide vanes and
five stages of variable stators that are controlled by the full-authority
digital engine control (FADEC). The rotor blades and stator vanes are
steel, for FOD resistance and low erosion.
   Downstream of the effusion-cooled, annular combustor are two
high-pressure turbine stages to drive the compressor, and two low-pressure
turbines that power the prop gear box. The engine's modular construction
eases maintenance chores, and most routine inspections can be done with a
conventional tool box.
   The FADECs not only control all the gas generator functions, but they
also are linked to the prop-control units, enabling the engine to be fitted
with single-power-lever controls. On the ground or in flight, the FADECs
keep the props virtually in perfect synchronization, even during prop speed
transitions.
   Five annunciator buttons select the appropriate rpm and power ranges for
various phases of flight: takeoff/go-around, max continuous power, climb,
cruise and flex power. The latter mode allows the use of reduced- power
takeoffs that lower thermal stress on the engine, and result in a more
comfortable acceleration rate for the passengers.

SAAB 2000 AVIONICS
   The Saab 2000 has the most sophisticated avionics system ever installed
in a turboprop regional aircraft, not only because of its power, but also
due to the way it ties into so many other aircraft systems.
   Six, 7.25-inch Collins Pro Line 4 EFIS tubes occupy most of the Saab
2000's instrument panel, including primary and secondary EICAS screens
inboard of the left- and right-side primary flight and navigation displays.
The amount of information that can be displayed almost seems more than
what's needed-and that's intentional. If one tube should fail, the aircraft
can be dispatched with the five remaining displays, providing that the
display can be moved to one of the center EICAS positions.
   The panel layout enhances hand-eye coordination. Directly above the
displays is a central, flight-guidance control panel, flanked by left- and
right-side radio-tuning units and display controllers. EFIS reversion
switches are located on the overhead panel.
   A Collins Integrated Avionics Processing System (IAPS) forms the hub of
the well-proven, hub-and-spoke, ARINC 429-linked Pro Line 4. Left- and
right-side data concentrator units (DCUs) receive inputs from analog and
digital engine and systems sensors, translate the data into ARINC 429 and
forward it to the IAPS for processing and display on the EICAS.
   Both DCUs are required for dispatch, and there is no provision for a
third, onboard spare.
   The Collins FMS 4100 flight management systems are optional. In our
opinion, these boxes offer less power and fewer features than competitive
FMS units and newer Collins designs.
   This year, the avionics system will be upgraded to Version 6.0. The FMS
will be improved, HUD will be added as an option, and enhanced GPS sensors
will be installed.

Illustration: Graph: B/CA Comparison Profile
*Saab 2000 at high-speed cruise, competitors at long-range cruise.
   Designers attempt to give aircraft exceptional capabilities in all
areas-including price-but the laws of physics do not allow one aircraft to
do all missions with equal efficiency. Tradeoffs are a reality of aircraft
design.
   In order to obtain a feeling for the strengths and compromises of a
particular aircraft, B/CA compares the subject aircraft's performance to
the composite characteristics of aircraft in its class. We average
parameters of interest for the aircraft that are most likely to be
considered as competitive with the subject of our analysis, and then we
compute the percentage differences between the parameters of the subject
aircraft and the composite numbers for the competitive group as a whole.
Those differences are presented in bar-graph form, and the absolute value
of the parameter under consideration, along with its rank with respect to
the composite, are given.
   For this Comparison Profile, we present selected parameters of the Saab
2000 in relation to a competitive group consisting of the Canadair
Corporate Jetliner, the de Havilland Corporate Dash 8-300 and the Fokker
Executive F50. It should be understood that this Comparison Profile is
meant to illustrate relative strengths and compromises of the subject
aircraft; it is not a means of comparing specific aircraft to each other.

Illustration: Graph: Time and Fuel Versus Distance. Time and Fuel Versus 
Distance-This graph shows the plot of two missions: the first flown at
maximum-speed cruise and the second at long-range cruise. The numbers at
the hour lines indicate cumulative miles and fuel burned for each of the
two profiles. The intermediate points on these lines are accurate only for
the full trip; however, they can provide the user with a rough idea of the
time and fuel required for trips of intermediate length. For example, the
Saab 2000 can carry a 7,200-pound payload, representative of 36 passengers,
more than 1,200 miles at high-speed cruise. Flying at an average long-range
cruise speed of 289 KTAS results in a range of about 1,600 miles with the
same payload.

Illustration: Graph: Specific Range. Specific Range-The specific range of
an aircraft, the ratio of nautical miles flown to pounds of fuel burned
(nm/lb), is a measure of its fuel efficiency. This graph shows specific
range values at three altitudes at a mid-range cruise weight of 44,000
pounds. For example, the Saab 2000 cruising at 360 KTAS at FL 310 at this
weight achieves an SFC of 0.19 nm/lb. Note how pronounced the SFC curve is
from long-range cruise to high-speed cruise at each of the three charted
altitudes.

Illustration: Graph: Range/Payload Profile. Range/Payload Profile-The
purpose of this graph is to provide rough simulations of trips under a
variety of payload and airport density altitude conditions, with the goal
of flying the longest distance. For the Saab 2000, we have used high-speed
cruise instead of long-range cruise for all weights. The payload lines,
which are intended for gross simulation purposes only, are each generated
from end points. Time and fuel burns, shown at the top of the chart, are
plotted for individual one-, two- and three-hour missions published in the
aircraft operating manual. For example, the Saab 2000 can carry a
7,200-pound payload (36 passengers) more than 1,200 nm without
departure-airport density altitude limitations. Remember, the runway
distances are based on the 100-percent normal takeoff power of 3,770 shp
and flaps 15-not the reduced flex power setting of 91 percent used for the
specifications box.


Photograph(s):
Photograph: The Saab 2000's lineage is immediately apparent. The nose
retains the Model 340's lines, and the fuselage, although 24 feet longer,
has the same cross-section as the 340. The wing also is a scaled version of
the 340's. The propulsion package, including a composite Dowty propeller,
is all new.

Photograph: Saab has been demonstrating a 2000 with a corporate
configuration featuring 36 seats. The aircraft has two forward club
sections that seat six passengers each, and 24 passenger seats with a
34-inch seat pitch. The forward section of the cabin includes two garment
closets and generous storage lockers for carryon bags. The galley and
storage occupy the aft-most portion of the cabin.

Photograph: The Saab 2000 carries 9,370 pounds of fuel in wet-wing fuel
tanks. Single-point pressure refueling allows the aircraft to take on a
full load of fuel in about 15 minutes.

TWO LIGHTS IN ONE

   From Sporty's Pilot Shop comes the Duolite, which changes in a
twinkling
from a conventional flashlight to a directional wand or low-in-tensity
lantern for use in the cockpit. To switch the Duolite from one role to
another, the user need only pull the head assembly to its fully extended

NO BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY, THIS
The Washington merry-go-round continues to dilute confidence in the people
who run our country.

By:
Torch Lewis

   At this juncture, the government has just reopened, having been shut
down for nearly a week and affecting 800,000 workers who labor for Uncle
Sam. The irony of the situation is that all these folks will be paid for
their enforced vacation, so they might just as well have stayed on the
job.
   Part of the blame can be affixed on House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Returning aboard Air Force One from the funeral services for Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, he was relegated to the coach section and enjoined
not to use the forward lav.
20 His Speakership took extraordinary umbrage at this presidential snub,
and vented his political petulance in the Halls of Congress by being an
obstacle to progress. He slowed the settlement of the stalemate of
budgetary differences between the Republicans and Democrats, a.k.a. Dole
versus Clinton.
20 The pundits who cover and chafe at the Washington scene called it a
draw. Madam Rivkin, who is in charge of our moneybags, hinted that it might
have been necessary to shut down our ATC system. Of course, this was merely
sabre rattling. But one thing she did is a puzzlement. In order to keep
certain vital functions of the government running, she transferred $62
billion from the Civil Service retirement fund to the OMB.
20 Not only is it astonishing that one person or department possesses
such fiscal clout, but I was under the false impression that retirement
funds-especially government ones-were sacrosanct. It also beggars the
question as to whence cometh the funds to send $12 billion to Mexico. (This
extrapolates out to $500 for every citizen in the U.S.A.)
   Hersch, what do you think of our chances of being repaid for this
``loan''? Perhaps about as good as getting repaid the dough we were owed
from World War I?
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the government goslings are flapping their
galluses over what to do about the FAA. The only area of agreement is that
something needs to be done about it. Republican Senator John McCain's
addled overview is that reformation is the answer. Among his convoluted
proposals is a special tax on business jets and an easement on airline
fees.
20 In my humble opinion, the most sensible reform is to make the FAA an
independent agency, headed by a strong leader with extended tenure,
supported by a knowledgeable committee that would receive director fees for
monthly meetings rather than full-time employment. This would attract some
real talent. Most of this proposal is embodied in HR 2276, which was before
the House at press time.
20 Spearheading the opposition, nach, is Secretary Federico Pea, whose
power will be heavily diminished by loss of authority over the 50,000 souls
overseeing the governance of the FAA.
20 As an independent agency, the FAA could function vastly more
efficiently to update equipment and modus operandi. The present air traffic
controllers should be awarded medals for their exceptional handling of
heavy traffic with some equipment older than my dog tags. Recent failures
of equipment in Oakland, Chicago and New York breed only contempt for the
present arduous process of equipment replacement. Little consolation can be
drawn from the fact that no two aircraft have come together as a result of
these dreadful and completely unnecessary outages. Pilot skills, pilot
skills.

WIND SHEAR CAN KILL
   A few weeks back, a good friend-who is a Learjet owner and an avid
golfer-underwent serious shoulder surgery; his second. The cause of this
discomfiture was the result of a Mohawk Airlines crash at Rochester, New
York in July 1963. The Mohawk 404 took off in the teeth of a severe
thunderstorm and, as it lifted off, it encountered wind shear and crashed.
I believe the fatalities were the pilot and two others, with injuries to
almost all passengers.
20 My friend suffered a severe broken shoulder and other injuries. The
paraphernalia installed in his shoulder permitted him to resume golf a year
or two later. The pins and whatnot finally failed, occasioning the
subsequent surgery.
20 Now comes the good news: Several avionics manufacturers have
certificated-or will soon certificate-airborne wind-shear detecting radar.
It took only 32 measly years to come up with this equipment. I do not fault
the avionics manufacturers for the delay because it has been the FAA's
responsibility to research the problem.
20 It is outrageous, in my view, that it took a full generation to
develop this vital equipment, especially since we have had airborne radar
for over 40 years.

WHO SHOULD SEE YOUR TRAINING RECORD?
Government must proceed with caution as it explores wider access to
pilot-training records.

By:
David Collogan

   Recently, B/CA urged the FAA to look favorably upon an expected NTSB
recommendation seeking to assure the free exchange of training and
competency information involving applicants for pilot positions.
   The NTSB's intent is rational: to prevent air carriers from passing
along inept pilots from company to company. But, the implementation of such
a rule is fraught with potential mischief.
   Conceptually, the issue should simply be that of protecting the air
carriers from civil suit when they pass on unflattering, but safety-related
training information. However, the NTSB recommendation, in its final form,
seems to avoid simplicity in favor of building another bureaucracy.
   The Safety Board proposes that airlines and private training companies 
be required to collect and provide the FAA with a paperwork mountain of
information on how pilots perform during training. Specifically, the NTSB
said those private enterprise businesses should ``maintain pertinent
standardized information on the quality of pilot performance in activities
that assess skills, abilities, knowledge and judgment during training,
check flights, initial operating experience and line checks.''
   The NTSB also wants the FAA to require airlines and training firms ``to
provide the FAA, for incorporation into a storage and retrieval system,
pertinent standardized information'' on those same pilot performance
parameters, which airlines should use for ``evaluating applicants for pilot
positions . . .'' These recommendations fail the smell test at every step:
   -- While private businesses must keep detailed training records for
their own purposes, they should not be responsible for collecting such
information for the federal government.
   -- The mere existence of such a federal database has terrible potential
for misuse.
   -- A cost/benefit analysis would show that such a record-keeping system
would cost millions of dollars and provide few, if any, safety benefits.
   -- Adoption of this element in the Board's suggestions would subject
airlines and training companies to never-ending lawsuits and focus their
attention on the legalities of record-keeping instead of the quality of
their training programs.
   It's important that you should know the background in case you missed it
in our December 1995 issue (Viewpoint, page 3). This all resulted from the
Safety Board's investigations into several recent pilot-error accidents,
the latest of which was the AMR Eagle/Flagship Airlines Jetstream crash in
North Carolina 13 months ago-the same accident that spawned the so-called
``one level of safety'' rule the FAA issued in December 1995.
   The NTSB blamed the accident on the pilot-in-command's incorrectly
assuming the Jetstream's engine had failed. (The No. 1 engine ignition
light illuminated, but the Board found no evidence of engine failure.)
Further, the Board noted the pilot's subsequent failure to follow approved
procedures for engine failure, go-around, and stall recovery.
   Also cited ``was the failure of AMR Eagle/Flagship management to
identify, document, monitor and remedy deficiencies in pilot performance
and training.''
What does any of this have to do with creating a database of pilot-training
records? Even though the pilot had been working for Flagship for four
years, the NTSB raised the issue of the pilot's less-than-exemplary record
at Comair, his previous employer.
   The Board said Flagship had not requested the pilot's records from
Comair when he was hired, nor was it Comair's policy to release such
records even if they had been requested. The NTSB believes some of the
pilot shortcomings might have been traceable back to his performance at
Comair.
   Air Line Pilots Association President Randolph Babbitt was sharply
critical of the NTSB's proposals, observing that after four years at
Flagship, any performance problems the pilot might have had when hired
should ``have been a known quantity [before the accident occurred] if the
qualification program were effective.''
   The ALPA president noted that training records and programs are not
uniform from carrier to carrier. Pilots also do not have the opportunity
``to comment on or rebut a particular notation,'' many of which are very
subjective, Babbitt said.
   The FAA said it recognizes the importance of pilot-training records, but
added, ``There are privacy issues that must be addressed. The FAA is
prepared to work with Congress, the NTSB and the aviation industry to
resolve these issues.''
   A dialogue between those groups may reveal ways to enhance safety by
providing limited access to pilot- training records, but any feasible plan
will stop far short of the NTSB's expensive and overreaching database
scheme.

COMMENT DEADLINE ON CERTIFICATION NPRM IS PUSHED BACK

   Persons and organizations who want to comment on a broad revision of
airman and training certification rules still can do so. Just days before
December 11, 1995, when the comment period was originally scheduled to
expire, the FAA responded to requests for more time and extended the
deadline until February 13. The proposal contains significant changes
regarding the certification of pilots, instructors and training
establishments (B/CA, November 1995, page 32).

SMALL COMMUTER AIRLINES BRACE FOR UPGRADED REQUIREMENTS

   On December 14, 1995, FAR Part 135 commuter airlines operating turbine
aircraft with 10 to 30 passenger seats got their first look at the new
rule-NPRM 95-5-that requires them to comply with the same regulations that
cover Part 121 carriers. Formerly, Part 121 extended only to scheduled
flights of aircraft with 31 or more passenger seats. The Regional Airline
Association expected the final rule to contain most of the elements of the
original proposal, and said it did not object to most of the proposal's
contents. In a related move, the FAA published its NPRM to revise duty
times and rest periods for airline pilots.

PERIODIC REVIEW OF REGULATIONS IS PROPOSED

   If the FAA adopts a notice of proposed rulemaking calling for
comprehensive regulatory reviews, the agency will conduct them beginning in
January 1997, and every three years thereafter. The review process will
allow for industry comment on what the public believes to be burdensome
FARs that should be amended or dropped. As with a similar 1994 review, the
FAA proposes to limit commenters to the three issues they consider most
urgent (B/CA, March 1994, page 15).

OPERATORS TO EVALUATE REDESIGNED APPROACH CHARTS

   Starting in December 1995, several thousand general aviation subscribers
to Jeppesen charts received evaluation copies of an approach chart
redesign. Among other changes, the new design includes approach data
arranged in horizontal strips across the top of the chart, as well as
critical navigation information in larger, bold type (B/CA, August 1995,
page 29). The evaluation phase will involve redesigned charts for the
following eight airports: Centennial County (ARA), Morristown (MMU), Van
Nuys (VNY), Santa Ana (SNA), St. Louis (STL), Portland (PDX), Charlotte
(CLT) and Westchester County (HPN).

   An interagency review of security implications of very precise GPS
signals, and testing of techniques to prevent hostile use of more accurate
signals, should be completed ``within a fairly short period of time,'' a
senior Defense Department official told the House Aviation Subcommittee.
The industry has been concerned about the continued lack of closure on the

PRATT & WHITNEY OBTAINS CANADA APPROVAL FOR GALAXY ENGINE

   The Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306A received certification from Transport
Canada in December 1995, and FAA approval was expected shortly. The
6,000-pounds-thrust engine is the newest member of the PW300 family and
represents the most powerful turbofan ever built by P&WC. The engine is
slated to power Israel Aircraft Industries' Galaxy business jet. The PW300
family, in addition to the new PW500 series selected to power the Bravo and

IMPROVEMENTS ON TAP FOR ATC OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO

   U.S. ATC is expected to start clearing more flights over the Gulf of
Mexico if initial enhancements to increase the range of VHF communications
become operational as scheduled, in December. ATC currently restricts the
number of flights in the Gulf region due to the limited range of VHF radio
services. The FAA will equip six strategically placed buoys with
satellite-communications capability to extend VHF range, which should allow

NTSB URGES THE FAA TO PERMIT SINGLE-ENGINE IFR IN ALASKA

   FAA is reviewing an NTSB recommendation to permit turbine-powered,
single-engine aircraft to provide revenue passenger service under IFR in
Alaska. The recommendation is one of 23 issued as part of an NTSB study of
aviation safety in Alaska. Proponents of allowing commercial-passenger
operations under IFR in single-engine turbine aircraft are hoping the
NTSB's position may spur the FAA to propose a rule allowing such operations
throughout the United States. Canada eased single-engine IFR operations
early in 1993 (B/CA, July 1995, page 11).

OCTOBER 1 IS DEADLINE FOR RENEWING MNPS LETTERS

   The date for the mandatory renewal of Letters of Authority (LOA) to
operate in North Atlantic Minimum Navigation Performance Specification
airspace has been pushed from October 1, 1995 to October 1, 1996. In
addition, the FAA says that references to training programs in the LOA may
now include the notation ``none.'' Also, the LOA equipment list now calls
for the part number rather than the serial number of the equipment. See AC
91-70 for general information on LOAs.

UNLEADED AVGAS WILL NOT SPARK FIRST BATCH OF CESSNA SINGLES

   Cessna's initial batch of new 172s and 182s, scheduled to get under
construction later this year, will not be designed to burn unleaded avgas.
The company said the American Society of Testing Materials' (ASTM) delay in
approving the specification for the new fuel forced the decision (B/CA,
June 1995, page 24). Phillips Petroleum, which could produce 82UL avgas,
says ASTM approval is still several months off. In the meantime, Cessna
says it has not abandoned its long-term plans to build aircraft that can
use unleaded avgas.

SOME COMPANIES ARE HOLDING DOWN PARTS PRICING

   Bell Helicopter Textron and Honeywell's commercial avionics unit are
among the companies extending price freezes on the purchase of replacement
parts through this year. For the second year in a row, Bell will not
increase prices for spare parts. In 1994, Bell raised spare parts prices an
average of less than 1.5 percent over 1993. In addition, Bell reduced the
prices on over 5,800 parts in 1995. Meanwhile, Honeywell is holding the
price of spares at June 1993 levels.

INDEFINITE DELAY CONTINUES ON MODE S REQUIREMENTS

   At press time, the FAA gave no indication of when it would re-impose a
rule requiring that transponders installed in transport-category aircraft
after a certain date be capable of replying to Mode S interrogations.
Nearly four years ago, the FAA rescinded such a requirement saying that
Mode S ground sensors are not expected to be fully operational until late
1995 and, therefore, it ``will not require Mode S transponders before that
time'' (B/CA, July 1992, page 17).

   AlliedSignal received FAA approval for a solid-state cockpit voice
recorder with a two-hour recording capability. The system weighs 15.5
pounds and is covered by a five-year warranty with no scheduled maintenance
requirements. In fall 1995, Loral received FAA and European certification
of its two-hour CVR (B/CA, October 1995, page 22). Most CVRs record for
only 30 minutes. Two-hour CVRs are expected to be required by the European

SIKORSKY STILL IS ON SCHEDULE WITH UPGRADED S-76

   In the second quarter, Sikorsky plans to offer another version of its
S-76C twin-turbine helicopter. The S-76C+ will be powered by the Turbomeca
Arriel 2S1, which features greater power output than the 1S1 in the S-76C.
The S-76C+ also will incorporate a new full-authority digital engine
control (FADEC) and single-crystal turbine blades. The Stratford,
Connecticut company claims the new model will provide greater single-engine
performance and better fuel specifics. A 76C+ retrofit for S-76Cs also will
be available (B/CA, June 1994, page 22).

   FAA ceased funding on December 31, 1995 for the continued operation of
the control towers at seven low-activity airports, citing the results of an
``exhaustive'' cost versus benefit study. Airports affected are:
Wheeling-Ohio County (HLG), Shreveport Downtown (DTN), Monroe County (BMG),
Delaware County (MIE), Lake Tahoe (TVL), Greenbriar Valley (LWB) and Cape
Girardeau (CGI). The agency said it will work with the airport authorities
if they decide to operate control towers themselves. About 35 U.S. cities
now operate non-federal towers.

ASIAN AEROSPACE `96 - SINGAPORE AIR SHOW

By:
J.M.


   The Asia/Pacific market is proving slower to develop than one might
think, but a good place to gauge its aspirations and take its pulse is
Asian Aerospace, the region's premier, biennial aviation trade show. This
year's event is being held at Singapore's Changi Airport on February 6-11.
   While other shows in the region focus on their local niches, Asian
Aerospace `96 is the big umbrella for the Asia/Pacific region as a whole.
And it's where the CEOs turn up en masse.
   Like other shows of its kind held recently, the Singapore air show is
shaping up to be bigger and better than ever. Participating companies are
up from 935 to 950, and from 34 countries as opposed to 31 two years ago.
Corporate chalets-so important for hobnobbing with customers and signing
deals-are up to 126 from 116. (To judge the growth of the show, compare
that with a mere 30 chalets as recently as 1988).
   The number of aircraft on display, however, will remain at around 70,
because of the immutable restrictions on outdoor space imposed by the
Changi Airport authorities. What will be interesting, though, will be the
proportion of business aircraft in the static park.
   Among them is bound to be a Singapore Airlines Learjet 31, one of six
operated by the airline for pilot training. The airline recently placed a
repeat order, and is slated to take four new Learjet 45s in the fourth
quarter of 1997, with options on another two. Learjet recently delivered a
Model 60 to Malaysia for airways inspection and calibration, and will have
a representative aircraft on show.
   The Citation X is slated to make its first Singapore appearance, as is
Bombardier's Global Express mockup. Gulfstream is unlikely to take the G-V
test aircraft that far that soon, settling instead for a G-IVSP on display.
Raytheon will be present with a Hawker 800 and Beechjet 400A, and Canadair
with a Challenger. Fairchild is making a first-time appearance as it senses
some demand for its 19- to 20-passenger Metroliner in the region, and Saab
will be playing up its larger 50-passenger Saab 2000. In that category, the
Canadair Regional Jet also will be on exhibit.
   Jet Aviation International, a corporate aircraft charter and management
company, is exhibiting for the first time, in support of its new Singapore
operations. Indeed, many of the developments in business aviation are
happening outside the show. Among them: Zimex recently opened a
business-aircraft maintenance/charter operation; Gulfstream has set up a
regional parts depot with $1.5 million worth of spares; and AlliedSignal
and Aviall have set up or beefed up their support for corporate-aviation
customers in the region.
   Back at the show, an undisputed highlight will be Bell Helicopter's
public unveiling of both the new Model 407 light single helicopter and
Model 430 intermediate twin helicopter, both of which will have just
received U.S. certification.

SUN-DEVIL-AREA FBOS MAKE SUPER BOWL PLANS

By:
L.M./G.A.G.

   Several Phoenix-area FBOs are making some special arrangements to
welcome pilots headed west with their passengers to the Super Bowl, on
January 28, at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.
   At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, all of the FBOs will be
extending some extra hospitality. The FBO managers with whom we spoke said
they have blocked hotel rooms, but urge all comers to claim them fast.
Hotel rooms are scarce-not only due to the Super Bowl, but because of the
Phoenix Open Golf Tournament taking place simultaneously. Travelers who are
late with their hotel bookings may have to shuttle to the game from
lodgings in Las Vegas or Tucson.
   Angelo Tedeschi, Cutter Aviation's general manager, says his facility
will have buffet-style refreshments, a large-screen television and
helicopter shuttles to and from the game. Super Bowl paraphernalia will be
for sale in the lobby. He's had rooms blocked for two years. GTA Aviation
Services and Sawyer Aviation also will offer food and big-screen TVs. In
addition, GTA will be auctioning off a Super Bowl ticket. At the city-run
Lincoln J. Ragsdale Executive Terminal, a 40-foot-by-60-foot hospitality
tent will be set up on the apron area just east of the terminal. The tent
will be equipped with a large-screen TV, tables, chairs (and heaters, if
necessary). Ballpark-theme food and beverages will be served.
   At Phoenix-Deer Valley Municipal Airport, General Manager Ron Haarer
says his facility is making rooms available. ``We have a flight academy and
will use some of the apartments,'' he explained. A big-screen TV will be
set up. Jet A will be selling for $1.67 per gallon using a credit card;
100LL for $1.73 using a credit card.
   The one FBO at Williams Gateway Airport-DynAir Fueling-is decking out
its lounge area with refreshments, a large-screen TV, a pool table and
movies on videocassette for those who don't want to watch the game. There
will be helicopter shuttles to and from the game site, and discount fuel
rates for the duration.
   At Scottsdale Airport, two FBOs are making a special hospitality effort.
Desert Aviation (formerly Aero Services) is assisting with room
accommodations and transportation. A big-screen TV and refreshments will be
awaiting the arrivals. Les Horrell, president, said that staff will help
pilots plot what to ``see and do'' while in the area. Russ Allen, director
of aviation services for Corporate Jets, says a reception cosponsored by
Learjet and AlliedSignal will greet the facility's guests. ``One hangar
will be decorated in a Super Bowl motif, and we will have catered food and
a large-screen TV,'' he noted. Also available will be 60 crew cars and a
few remaining blocked hotel rooms.
   From January 24-29, special arrival and departure procedures will be in
place at the following airports: Sky Harbor, Scottsdale, Deer Valley,
Falcon Field and Goodyear Municipal.
   A slot time (with a 30-minute window) will be required for all general
aviation IFR arrivals and departures. Beginning at 0600 hours to midnight
on January 22, pilots can call the Albuquerque traffic-management unit
(TMU) to request an arrival slot time and reservation number. Calls for a
departure slot can be made starting January 26. The toll-free number is
(800) 879-4435.
   Reservations can only be made 48 hours in advance of the estimated time
of arrival or departure. Pilots should be ready to provide the TMU with
departure and destination identifiers, and proposed UTC arrival/departure
time. The TMU will provide a time and reservation code that must be
included in the remarks section of the flight plan. Pilots must arrive no
more than five minutes before and no later than 10 minutes after their slot
time and depart in the block time allocated. Users not complying with these
times could face extensive delays.
   Except for emergencies, air-filed IFR flight plans, changes in
destination or aircraft without coded slot approvals will not be accepted
by ATC to land at the five program airports.
   The FAA warns that VFR aircraft desiring to land at Sky Harbor may
experience delays of more than 30 minutes. Pilots in VFR aircraft should
contact Phoenix Approach no later than 20 nm from Sky Harbor for delay and
Class B airspace clearance information.
   Overflight traffic not landing in the Phoenix areas should avoid
transiting within a 30-nm radius of Sky Harbor at and below 10,000 feet
msl.
   For more information, see the NOTAM issued on or about December 7.

A WAKE-UP CALL ON FATIGUE

By:
R.B.P.

   The NTSB has put out a wake-up call for managers and their line pilots
to start paying attention to the safety implications of crew fatigue.
   To spread the alarm, the Safety Board sponsored an international
conference in November 1995 to help determine the extent to which fatigue
contributes to transportation accidents, and to reveal some of the
countermeasures that can be used to avoid fatigue-related accidents. The
conference attracted more than 500 attendees from around the world.
   One NTSB member confided that although formal aviation-accident
investigations might not be able to identify fatigue as a frequent
contributing factor, he was convinced that about half of all
general-aviation accidents are fatigue related.
   David Dinges, M.D., from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School
in Philadelphia, discussed the vast amount of research that had been done
to uncover the characteristics of hazardous fatigue. Mark R. Rosekind, of
the NASA Fatigue Countermeasures Program in Moffett Field, California,
discussed a variety of steps that can be taken to avoid the often
devastating results of severe fatigue.
   The eye-opening message of the presentations was that an enormous
reservoir of information establishes irrefutably that no one is immune to
fatigue. Guest speakers made it clear that the effects of fatigue could be
heightened by a number of contributory conditions, including the lack of
proper nutrition and the impact of emotional disturbances. Rosekind and Dr.
Dinges also emphasized that while judicious use of caffeine might provide
some short-term beneficial effect in overcoming fatigue, the body soon
develops resistance to its awakening jolt.
   According to researchers, testing in recent years clearly has documented
the deleterious effects of fatigue on performing complicated tasks as well
as on judgment.
   Presenters conveyed examples of transportation accidents in which flawed
judgment resulting from fatigue was found to be causal. Examples cited were
the Exxon Valdez grounding and an aircraft accident at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
in 1993 in which the crew had been on duty for 18 hours and had flown for
approximately nine hours.
   Rosekind's research into fatigue countermeasures shows that a number of
techniques can be used to reduce or stave off the most serious fatigue
episodes. Brief supervised naps, although not presently authorized in most
aircraft operations, often refresh long-duty crewmembers. Bright lights and
animated conversations in the cockpit, too, sometimes help (but that
suggestion can butt up against the sterile cockpit theory).
   Researchers agree that in aviation, pilots and managers must be well
informed in order to understand the complexity of forcing the body clock to
work in accordance with the demands of modern business. Ultimately, the
physical toll will demand the modification of rules that allow unrealistic
expectations to be made of individuals.
   At present, few pilots receive any training or information on how to
avoid fatigue.What's more, many career aviators still believe they are
immune to its hazardous effects.
   In coming months, the FAA may revise rules and recommendations regarding
duty and flight times for pilots. Meanwhile, managers and line pilots can
study and consider the scientific information on fatigue.
   Here are some sources:

SUPERIOR TURBINE: PMA AT ITS BEST

By:
G.A.G.


   Concern over replacement parts has long been a part of aviation,
particularly when the source of those parts has been other than the
OEM-such as independent parts distributors, repair stations or Parts
Manufacturer Approval (PMA) companies.
   Indeed, concern particularly over bogus replacement parts issues in the
airline industry (not any actual increase in the number of incidents)
reached a crescendo when the FAA disclosed plans to tighten up rules and
procedures for the manufacturing, distributing and disposal of replacement
parts.
   Few incidents of alleged wrongdoing by independent parts distributors
and repair stations have been reported. And, the vast majority of PMA
companies dealing with general-aviation parts are not only legitimate, but
also can offer some significant advantages over OEM-provided parts.
   Dallas-based Superior Turbine is an example of a PMA company at its
best. Superior Turbine was founded in 1992 to manufacture parts for the
Allison 250 series engines. The company is a division of Superior Air
Parts, established in 1967 and now one of the largest suppliers of parts
for Continental and Lycoming piston engines. In 1995, Superior Turbine
started operating out of a new Dallas-based facility.
   Good PMA companies claim they offer these four primary advantages over
OEMs: lower prices, speedier delivery, expanded warranties and better
quality. For instance, Superior says it sells Allison parts at 25 percent
below Allison Engine's list prices. Of course, once after-market parts
suppliers begin competing with OEMs, most original manufacturers drop their
prices to meet the competition. In addition, many PMA firms, like Superior,
ship parts much faster than the typical OEM. OEMs' shipments can take up to
90 days because replacement parts are only a small portion of many OEM
businesses.
   As competitors with OEMs, Superior and other PMA firms strive to provide
parts of higher quality than the original ones they are replacing. For
example, Superior entered the turbine-engine-parts business with its ST-250
package, consisting of Superior-developed and certificated hot-section and
overhaul replacement parts for Allison 250s.
   Because Superior feels its parts are of a higher quality than originals,
the company covers its products with a materials and workmanship warranty
that is often longer than the OEM's: two years or 1,000 hours of engine
operation. A prorated warranty is in effect in the third year.
   However, even the best of PMA firms are not infallible. When most
suppliers were out of a certain Lycoming engine rod bolt, Superior found a
dealer that had some surplus bolts. Since they were presented as genuine
Lycoming bolts, and since an inspection of the first batch revealed they
were acceptable, Superior ordered 3,000 bolts and began to sell them to
engine shops.
   Superior later discovered that some bolts in the last batch didn't meet
spec, and the company immediately drafted a service bulletin and urged the
FAA to issue an AD. In addition, the company used its parts-tracking system
to identify and contact all customers who bought the suspect bolts.
   One engine failure was traced to the bolts, and although Superior didn't
manufacture the defective bolts, it offered to pay for labor, new bolts and
other related parts.
   Operators will find that the best of the PMA firms provide that kind of
customer support, in addition to being a provider of high-quality parts.

SPLITTING AIRS

By:
P.E.B.

   A recent NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System report provides a good
reminder (as though you'd forgotten) that the FAA sometimes splits hairs
when defining operating procedures.
   A VFR pilot called approach control prior to entering Class B airspace.
The controller responded with the aircraft's call sign, transponder code
and a request for an ident, with which the pilot complied.
   The airman continued his flight and penetrated the Class B boundary.
About a minute later, the controller said, ``I guess a clearance means
nothing, but you are cleared into the Class B airspace,'' the pilot related
in his ASRS account.
   The pilot had assumed-wrongly-that giving him a code implied clearance.
Not so, says the FAA, which says look at the FARs and the Aeronautical
Information Manual. FAR Part 91.131 and the AIM stipulate that a pilot must
be specifically cleared to enter Class B airspace.
   However, had the pilot been approaching Class C or Class D airspace, he
would have been perfectly legal. The standard in those instances requires
simply establishing two-way radio communication. In other words, as long as
a controller answers a call using the aircraft call sign (even to ask a
pilot to stand by), then two-way communication has been established, and
the pilot is free to enter Class C or D airspace-unless specifically asked
to remain clear.
   Another split hair: If the controller responds to a call, but does not
use your call sign, two-way communica-tion has not been established,
according to the AIM and ATC controllers' handbook. For instance, if your
call is answered with, ``Aircraft calling,
stand by,'' you have to stay clear of Class C and D airspace as well as
Class B.

BOOK REVIEW: AVIATION MANAGEMENT, CASTRO STYLE

By:
P.E.B.

   In his preface to Corporate Aviation Management, author Raoul Castro
sets an ambitious goal: to write a ``practical guide for the executive in
charge of the aviation department, the aviation department manager or chief
pilot, aspirants to aviation management positions, and teachers and
students of aviation management.''
   What results is a 349-page text that is a soup-to-nuts guide for
corporate aviation management. Because it sets out to do so much, the text
is best used as an overview, and is likely to appeal more to those people
studying business aviation or interested in rising through the ranks in
corporate flight departments than to current managers.
   The book is organized into four parts: an overview of corporate aviation
and basic management principles, a discussion of flight-department
economics, a section Castro calls the ``Seven Key Factors,'' and a brief
section that attempts to predict the future of corporate aviation.
   The crux of the book is delivered in the second and third sections.
Within the economics section is a chapter on how to assess the costs and
benefits of aircraft operations. Castro delves deeply into justification
issues, providing useful real-world examples of how to compare the use of
business jets to other modes of transportation, and how to translate the
time business jets save into money that can offset the cost of aircraft
operation.
   Section three breaks down corporate aviation into three departments and
four operational objectives, which combine to form Castro's ``Seven Key
Factors.'' The departments are: flight, maintenance, and schedule and
passenger service. The operational objectives are: safety, security,
emergency planning and training. It is this section that touches-sometimes
too briefly-on virtually every facet of corporate-aircraft operations.
   The author's writing style is sometimes choppy, but at the same time,
the book is easy to understand and a quick read. Castro, who currently
works as an aviation consultant, has held (since 1947) positions too
numerous to mention in corporate aviation, including 17 years as manager of
Marcor's multi-aircraft flight department.
   Corporate Aviation Management is published by the Southern Illinois
University Press and is available for $34.95, plus $3 postage and handling.
To order, call SIU at (800) 346-2680.

CRM-THE AMPLIFIED FORM

By:
L.M.

   A Stow, Massachusetts-based company-Cockpit Management Resources
(CMR)-takes crew resource management (CRM) a step beyond the one-seminar
approach. The company, established in 1979, contracts with corporations to
give individualized, year-long training-correspondence-course style-to
pilots.
   ``We don't believe you can change behavior in a short workshop,'' said
Bob Mudge, who is a co-president and founder of CMR, along with his son,
Gordon.
   The elder Mudge is a former pilot with Delta Airlines, and previously
Northeastern Airlines, while his son is a general aviation pilot. According
to Bob Mudge, the company's interaction with each pilot amounts to
approximately 18 to 24 hours per year. ``Our approach to CRM differs from
traditional CRM in that it is objective, not subjective.'' And it is
private, between each pilot and CMR.
   Pilots enrolled in the program receive one study unit per month for 12
months. The units include written material for the student to study, plus
audiotapes of pilot, copilot and check pilot scenarios. Once students feel
they have mastered the material, they must complete essay questions or
multiple-choice questions and mail the answers back to CMR for feedback and
critique.
   The company has coined its approach to CRM as the Quantum-Pro Management
System. To CMR, Cockpit Resource Management is a systematic, ``not just
psychological or operational training method.'' CMR emphasizes the
debriefing-tracing errors back to their cause ``so crewmembers can avoid
them in future flights,'' said Mudge. ``What we're after is significant,
measurable improvement in flightcrew performance that lasts over time.''
   Kevin Lynch, a pilot for a Fortune 50 company on the West Coast and
program coordinator in his flight department for Quantum-Pro said, ``What
helped us most is the debrief, going over the strengths and weaknesses of a
flight. The program also defined a common set of tools that everyone in the
flight department can use to make communication happen.'' Lynch said the
CMR program introduces standard management procedures that the pilots can
implement without question, just like standard operating procedures.
   Mudge says the goal of CMR's Quantum-Pro system is a quality-controlled
flight department that performs with increased safety, fewer regulatory
violations, improved customer service, lower training expenses, higher
morale and fewer internal administrative/personnel problems.
   CMR offers two versions of the course. The fee for the all-up version,
requiring responses to essay questions, is $3,395 per pilot. Another
version that involves less individualized interaction with CRM, and
responses to multiple-choice questions, costs $2,495. If a corporation
wants to kick off the program with a two-day workshop on site, there's an
extra charge of roughly $3,000. Other workshop arrangements are
negotiable.
   For information on setting up a program, call (508) 897-6237.

LET'S GET PHYSICAL

By:
R.O.R.

   Ever worry about what happens to the EKG that is transmitted to the FAA
during your flight physical? Many do-unnecessarily. The process has been in
use for years, and few bugs invade the system.
   The data from an AME's EKG machine are faxed to the FAA's EKG center in
Oklahoma City. There, a computer reads the data received. If the computer
reads something that is out of normal range, an FAA doctor reviews the
tracing. Then, if it is considered ``clinically significant'' (a true heart
problem), your AME may get a call. If it is only suspicious, the agency
will probably write you requesting that you have the EKG repeated. In the
latter case, the AME already has signed you off, so you won't be grounded.
But the FAA expects you to comply with its request for another test.
   But, what about those bugs that can affect any electronic transmission?
Contrary to popular belief, those electronic glitches are easily detected
because they don't come close to the signal put out by your heart. If a
faulty transmission occurs, there is often an immediate alarm in Oklahoma
City, and the FAA will attempt to call the AME before you leave the office.
At worst, you might have to return to the AME for a retest, but a pilot is
never grounded as a result of a transmission anomaly.
   What's more, before the agency required EKGs to be transmitted, there
were more errors and queries generated from handwritten copies being
mailed.
   Incidentally, it's smart to ask your AME to read your EKG before it's
transmitted to the FAA. The leads hooking you to the EKG machine can be
reversed or loose, or the doctor may need to explain a variation. Of
course, it's far more expedient if the FAA initially gets an accurate
tracing along with a clinically acceptable explanation for a variation.

A TUG HERE, A PUSH THERE

By:
G.A.G.


   Once more, communication and cooperation win without the power of size
or weight. We are referring to the success of smaller, regionally oriented
aviation groups to obtain significant changes in the way the federal
government does business.
   A few months ago, it was the New York State Aviation Association as
victor (B/CA, November 1995, page 42). This time, it is the culmination of
more than three years of effort by the Teterboro Users and Operators
Association-known locally as TUG (Teterboro Users Group).
   One of the tangible effects of TUG's constant dialogue with Northeast
area ATC officials has been a marked reduction in traffic delays at New
Jersey's Teterboro Airport. (See accompanying chart.)
   These reductions in delays come, in part, directly from the following
TUG-encouraged enhancements: the creation of a secondary departure
position, a VOR/DME approach for Runway 24, charted visual approaches for
Runways 1 and 6, lower minimums for the ILS to Runway 6, and the Dalton
Departure Procedure. The FAA is also working on developing an LDA approach
for Runway 19.
   TUG turned its attention to Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM)
criteria at a meeting with ATC officials in December 1995. The FAA provided
information on the cost and the process for obtaining RVSM approval.
   For more information on Northeast operations from the customer's point
of view, or on how to start your own local corporate aircraft association,
contact Peter Bellini, TUG president, at (201) 847-3399.

AVCOMPS UPDATE

By:
G.A.G.

   England-based Captain Zvi Doron, the person who brought you the
Hummingbird software for evaluating and comparing helicopter performance
(B/CA, September 1995, page 58), recently introduced similar software for
light and medium airplanes. Called Sparrowhawk, the PC-compatible program
allows comparison of performance capabilities for up to three aircraft
simultaneously. Parameters of aircraft from two-seat pistons to twin-engine
turboprops are included in the database.
   The program contains a list of default values to ensure an unbiased
comparison, says Doron. The defaults include number of crewmembers, crew
weight, average passenger weight and fuel reserves in terms of flying time.
The user can redefine these defaults according to the operating
conditions.
   Specific mission profiles can be tested by defining range or payload
requirements. An editing menu allows the user to explore numerous
combinations of existing, modified or new aircraft.
   In addition to having a PC with MS-DOS 3.0 or higher, users need at
least 640 KB of memory and a color or monochrome VGA monitor with a
standard resolution of 640 x 480.
   Software price is $175. For more information, contact Zvi Doron or
Andrew Healey at 56, The Glades, East Grinstead, West Sussex RH19 3XW
England. Phone/fax: +01 (0) 44 1342 314117.

SAVANNAH SKY WELCOMES THE GULFSTREAM V

   The start of the airborne certification test phase of the Gulfstream V
(shown here on its 1+18 first flight on November 28, 1995) is significant.
The maiden flight of the 6,500-nm-range G-V occurred within 60 days of the
date Gulfstream set over 39 months ago (B/CA, October 1992, page 52), and
the initial flight of the airframe also marked the initial flight of the
BR710 engines, the first powerplant to be developed jointly by BMW and
Rolls-Royce. Three more G-Vs will join the flight-test program. If the
aircraft is FAA certificated in October, Gulfstream will meet the exact
schedule the company set in late 1992.

   On the program will be expert presenters holding forth on subjects as
diverse as ditching and water survival, jungle survival, inflight emergency
case studies and more.
   During a presentation called ``Anatomy of an Accident,'' members of a
panel will discuss their experiences in a runway-collision accident between
a B737 and a Fairchild Metro at Los Angeles Airport.
   One day will be set aside for small-group tutorials, chaired by safety
professionals. Topics to be covered are: teaching emergency procedures,
critical incident stress, setting up a flight-safety office and accident
management procedures.
   The Civil Aeromedical Institute will conduct a workshop in an aircraft
cabin mockup.
   Tuition is $450. To register, call SCSI at (310) 540-2612. L.M.

MACAU

   Macau International Airport (VMMC), a possible Hong Kong alternate, is
now open. Corporate arrivals are handled at temporary gates in the main
terminal. Visas are not required for U.S. passengers and crew. High-speed
ferry service (a five-minute drive from the airport) can carry passengers
on a one-hour trip to Hong Kong. Or, helicopter flights can ferry
passengers to Hong Kong in about 20 minutes. Train service to Hong Kong
also is available. Airport fees are expected to be 10- to 15-percent below
Hong Kong's, but will probably match those of Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kak
airport when it opens in 1998.

ATLANTIC CITY: THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE FAA

By:
Robert A. Searles

   For most business-aircraft operators, the FAA is the local inspector who
dutifully, and usually cordially, conducts certification check rides and
maintenance inspections. But no matter how amicable your local Flight
Standards District Office (FSDO) representative is, there are times when
you wonder if the agency isn't just a Washington-based bureaucracy whose
primary objective is to make life difficult for those who fly.
   In an era in which it has become fashionable to criticize all government
agencies (especially regulatory bodies), it's tempting to think of the FAA
as a phalanx of curmudgeons bent on hassling operators. But despite current
stereotypes of aviation-agency personnel, there are 1,500 full-time
employees at the FAA's Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey who
are working quietly and conscientiously to develop new technologies and
procedures that will make flying safer, easier and more efficient.
   The FAA Technical Center, which recently celebrated its 15th
anniversary, is a national scientific test base for the agency's research,
development and acquisition programs. Located on the 5,000-acre, FAA-owned
Atlantic City International Airport, the Tech Center tests and evaluates
systems and procedures of ATC, airborne communications and navigation,
airports, aircraft safety and airline security.
   In addition, the Tech Center is responsible for long-range development
of innovative systems and concepts, as well as new aviation hardware and
software. The facility also modifies existing equipment and procedures. At
any given time, 150 projects are under way at the center.
   One of the reasons that much of the FAA's research and development is
conducted at the FAA Technical Center is because Atlantic City is subject
to a wide range of weather conditions. The site also is close to the
Northeast's high-density air-traffic corridor, yet has open airspace over
the nearby Atlantic Ocean.
   The Tech Center site, located 10 miles northwest of Atlantic City, was
originally developed during World War II as a naval air station. When the
aviation infrastructure was struggling to keep pace with the rapidly
expanding postwar use of civil aircraft, the Airways Modernization Board
took over the facility on July 1, 1958 and renamed it the National Aviation
Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC).
   NAFEC inherited three dozen wooden buildings that were erected in the
early 1940s, which made it difficult to perform some of the experiments
that required strictly controlled test environments. Although the FAA moved
its fleet of specially instrumented aircraft into a new, modern hangar at
Atlantic City in 1968, for many years NAFEC was unable to get enough money
to modernize the other facilities there.
   By the early 1970s, the expense and inconvenience of continuing to work
in dilapidated buildings made the agency seriously consider moving its test
and evaluation functions to Oklahoma City. The poor working conditions at
Atlantic City, coupled with recurring rumors of the center's imminent
demise, took a toll on the morale of NAFEC personnel.
   However, the threat of an impending shutdown coalesced support among
NAFEC proponents. Local citizens-led by the first NAFEC director, a
congressman and a one-time Atlantic City mayor-formed a partnership with
other government officials to obtain the backing necessary to modernize
NAFEC's physical plant. Their efforts resulted in a new, $50-million,
four-story, 516,000-square-foot building. On May 29, 1980, Vice President
Walter Mondale and FAA Administrator Langhorne Bond presided over the
dedication of the new FAA Technical Center, the name by which not only the
building but also the entire complex has since been known.
   The Tech Center is unique because of its ability to conduct total
systems testing and integration. At least one example of every electronic
system installed in the ATC system-from those troublesome 1960s vintage
computers to the latest digital devices-can be found at Atlantic City. As
one Tech Center official said, ``We're the first FAA facility to get the
new equipment and the last to get rid of the old equipment.''
   By having access to all types of ATC equipment and utilizing the Tech
Center's immense simulation capability, project engineers can experiment
with modifications to existing equipment or procedures without having to
take a single runway or navaid out of service.
   In addition to relying on simulation of new equipment and techniques,
the Tech Center uses a variety of specially equipped aircraft to test-fly
new hardware and procedures, collect data and flight-check experimental
ground-based surveillance systems, navaids and other guidance systems. The
current fleet of ``flying laboratories'' consists of two Convair 580s and a
Sikorsky S-76 (all with glass cockpits), a Boeing 727-100, a Beech King Air
and a twin-piston Aero Commander.
   The Tech Center's aircraft operate primarily from Atlantic City
International Airport, which has two runways, including one that is 10,000
feet long. However, what makes the airfield distinctive are its
experimental approach and guidance systems. Atlantic City is the site of
the National Concepts Development and Demonstration Heliport and is
equipped with MLS, AWOS, PAPI and a system of reconfigurable landing
lights.
   The Tech Center also has one of the finest aircraft test ranges in the
world, and over the years, the facility's navigation branch has developed
an ex-ceptional data collection, reduction and analysis capability. As Tom
Grygotis, manager of the Tech Center's flight-test branch, said, ``You can
test things here you can't test anywhere else in the world.''
   But it takes qualified people as well as sophisticated equipment to make
a technical center. Atlantic City was able to make the transition from a
test and evaluation facility to one that is more involved in conceptual
work by injecting a lot of young, high-technology blood into the
organization, remembers former acting FAA Administrator Joseph Del Balzo.
He started at the Tech Center as a project engineer in 1960 and served as
director of the facility for five years beginning in 1976.
   ``We had a lot of joint programs with universities,'' recalled Del
Balzo, who now heads a consulting firm in Washington, D.C. ``Embry-Riddle
conducted advanced degree courses on [the Tech Center] campus, and we had a
doctorate program in human factors in conjunction with Columbia University.
At that time, we ran the government's largest co-op program, especially
with minority institutions, which accounts for the diversity at the Tech
Center today.''
   By attracting technically qualified people to Atlantic City, the Tech
Center was able to convince headquarters that it could assume complete
program responsibility for research into such areas as aircraft safety and
airport technology. This, in turn, led to a resident world-class technical
capability in a host of disciplines, from ATC simulation and aircraft
crashworthiness to fire testing and human factors.
   For example, the ATC simulation facility can replicate, in real time,
virtually any airport and traffic situation in the world on its radar
displays, thanks to its ability to ``fly'' up to 400 computer-generated
aircraft. The air traffic labs can be configured to represent an en route,
terminal or automated FSS facility, and a tower cab mockup is used to plan
the layout of positions and equipment for use in control towers.
   The Tech Center's Human Factors Lab uses advanced techniques, such as
virtual reality, to study the man-machine interface. Future airport designs
can be reviewed by flying approaches to computer-generated runways. This
lab also utilizes a reconfigurable cockpit simulator in which video
displays are altered to test various instrument panel layouts and
presentations.
   Also housed at the FAA Technical Center is the world's largest
full-scale, aviation fire-test facility. Experiments conducted there paved
the way for the development of fire-blocking seat materials, emergency
floor lighting, heat-resistant emergency slides and today's stringent
standards for cabins and cargo compartment materials.
   The Tech Center's aircraft crashworthiness facilities include a 50-foot
drop tower, a catapult and a track for rapid deceleration or impact tests.
A number of general-aviation aircraft-including a Beech 1900, one of two
remaining Learfans and a dozen Piper fuselages given to the FAA after the
company's Lock Haven factory was flooded in 1972-are being used at this
facility.
   Other test facilities located at the Tech Center range from wind tunnels
and chemistry labs to engine test cells and an environmental chamber that
can simulate heat, humidity, altitude and rainfall.
   What has all this research meant for business aviation? Besides
developing numerous improvements for the airspace system in general, the
Tech Center extensively flight-tested GPS in conjunction with industry,
which led to IFR certification of the system and creation of non-precision
GPS approaches. Atlantic City also developed general aviation
occupant-restraint systems and energy- absorbing seats. In addition, the
facility proved the feasibility of simple, inexpensive design changes that
enhanced the load-carrying capability of light airplanes.
   GA-related projects that the Tech Center is working on today include:
production of a viable no-lead avgas, refinement of TCAS I and development
of sensors that would give pilots a visual indication of icing.
   Despite the FAA Technical Center's immense capabilities, not every
project undertaken is successful. For example, the FAA's anti-misting
kerosene program, an effort to chemically alter turbine fuel to minimize
post-crash fires, didn't pan out. And some electronic systems, such as the
Beacon Collision Avoidance System (BCAS) and the Discrete Address Beacon
System (DABS), never made it into the field.
   But as former Tech Center director Del Balzo is quick to point out,
accomplishments shouldn't always be measured in terms of new systems.
``It's not so much the products and the technologies [produced by the Tech
Center], it's the development of people and a capability that will serve us
into the 21st century.''

CFIT PREVENTION

By:
Richard N. Aarons

   Flight Safety Foundation (FSF), the nonprofit, member-supported
international organization dedicated to improving flight safety, is
distributing a 33-minute videotape designed to help flightcrew members
avoid controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accidents. I urge you to beg,
borrow, steal or even buy a copy. This video, prepared by Jeppesen, is must
viewing for all pilots. The FSF will sell you a copy for $30 if you can't
find one elsewhere, but someone on your airport should have one soon; some
5,000 copies are being distributed at no cost to NBAA and FSF members.
   The video, funded by 28 commercial and organizational sponsors, is aimed
at flightcrews of busness turbine aircraft and regional transports.
However, its content is important for all IFR pilots. Basically, the tape
discusses the insidious nature of CFIT accidents-those in which flightcrews
were unaware of impending collisions with terrain-and it examines in detail
three such incidents.
   One accident, which involved a VOR approach in the Far East, includes
the final minutes of the U.S. corporate jet's cockpit voice recorder. It
enables us to listen in as misunderstanding grows between the controller
and the flightcrew until disaster becomes inevitable. It's a chilling
experience, but it carries with it an unforgettable lesson.
   Another CFIT example profiles a commuter accident that occurred during a
night approach over unlighted terrain in Canada. Computer animation enables
us to experience the black-hole effect that ultimately drew the crew into
the trees. The third accident involved a U.S. corporate jet that crashed
into a mountain shortly after takeoff. The crew was attempting to maintain
VFR while circling in hilly terrain trying to pick up an IFR flight plan.
   Stuart Matthews, FSF president, chairman and CEO, says this video ``is a
strong accident prevention tool,'' and we agree entirely with that
assessment. Says Matthews, ``The risk of being involved in a CFIT accident
is linked to a number of factors, including equipment, flightcrew training
and type of operation. Although the majority of CFIT fatalities occur on
large commercial aircraft, the largest number of CFIT accidents involve
smaller turboprop and jet aircraft. But no matter what type of aircraft you
fly, your CFIT risk increases dramatically during the approach phase.
   While you're tracking down a copy of the video, be sure to get a copy of
the FSF's CFIT checklist, a risk assessment tool that enables you to
evaluate the threat of CFIT in any specific operation. The videotape
project, along with the checklist and a simulator scenario (currently under
development by Boeing), are part of the FSF's five-year program to reduce
CFIT accidents by half.
   This excellent project is another reason why B/CA is a member of the
FSF, and why we urge all flight operations to support it through membership
activity or sponsorships. For more information, contact the FSF at 2200
Wilson Blvd., Ste. 500, Arlington, VA 22201-3306. Phone: (703) 522-8300.

MESABA DISCONTINUES DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

   Citing a need to concentrate working capital on acquisition of new
aircraft, Mesaba Holdings has announced that it is discontinuing the
payment of dividends to stockholders. The last dividend-three cents per
share-was paid in the June 1995 quarter.
   Bryan Bedford, the carrier's new president and CEO, said that the
Minneapolis-based regional continues to have a strong balance sheet and
that earnings remain in line with analysts' expectations. The company has
been conducting extensive evaluations of new aircraft, planning a
near-complete replacement of its existing fleet that includes 26 Fairchild
Metros and 25 de Havilland Dash 8-100s (B/CA, December 1995, page C2).
   ``The company is analyzing various fleet replacement options now and
expects to make a decision on the new fleet by the [1995],'' a statement
said. The carrier is believed to have selected the Beech 1900 to replace
the Metros, but also has been considering the 29-passenger Jetstream 41.
Heading the short list for a 30-passenger-class aircraft were the Dornier
328, Saab 340BPlus and the incumbent Dash 8-probably the 200 series.
Mesaba's existing Dash 8s begin coming off their short-term leases this
year.
   Mesaba operates as a Northwest Airlink carrier from the senior partner's
Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul hubs. Northwest owns approximately 30
percent of its affiliate, which operates 405 daily flights from the two
hubs.

EAGLE BOARDS 75 MILLIONTH

   ``More than 75 million served. No, not hamburgers-people.'' That is the
way the AMR Eagle press release announced the carrier's 75 millionth
passenger in 11 years of operation. The actual number was 75.25 million,
which roughly equals one-third of the U.S. population.
   ``Becoming the first regional airline to transport more than 75-million
passengers is an incredible achievement and points to our growing niche in
the air transportation industry,'' said Eagle President Dan Garton. Eleven
years ago, the carrier operated just 60 daily flights to seven cities.
Today the number is more than 1,600 daily departures to more than 150
destinations in the United States, Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean,
making it the largest regional airline in the world.
   In an unrelated development, Eagle has named Lance McDonald to the newly
created position of vice president of flight operations. McDonald has
served the past seven years as vice president of flight operations for
Eagle unit Simmons Airlines.
   In his new job, McDonald will direct the development of standardized,
cost-effective flight operations and procedures among the four Eagle
carriers-Executive, Flagship, Wings West and Simmons. He also will oversee
revision and distribution of fleet-specific operations manuals, coordinate
operational and regulatory issues with the FAA, direct operations of
Eagle's Emergency Management Center, and supervise the carrier's System
Operations control, which includes crew scheduling and dispatch.
   One more newly created position still to be filled at B/CA press
time-that of vice president of maintenance and engineering-effectively
divides the responsibilities of Vice President of Operations Robert Zoller,
who is retiring after four years in the post. It was Zoller who supervised
a number of key operational changes at Eagle.
   They included the centralization and automation of Systems Operations
Control; creation of the Eagle Flight Training Center; design and
implementation of automated dispatch, flight planning and fuel planning
systems; and development of standardized maintenance inspection programs
for the Eagle fleet.

COMAIR TAKES ANOTHER 10 CRJS

   Delta Connection Comair has reaffirmed its affection for the Canadair
Regional Jet by exercising its options for 10 additional aircraft. The
order will bring the Cincinnati-based carrier's CRJ fleet to 45.
   Comair currently operates 26 CRJs and holds options that could take the
fleet to 70, making it by far the CRJ fleet leader. As of December 1, 1995,
the carrier operated its CRJ fleet to 48 destinations in the United States
and Canada with 188 daily flights.
   The order confirmed the 132 firm orders for the 50-passenger jet with 82
aircraft delivered to nine customers in the United States, Canada, France,
Austria and Germany.

CAT IIIA/HUD CERTIFICATED FOR CRJ

   Transport Canada has certificated the Canadair Regional Jet for Category
IIIA operations with the Flight Dynamics HGS 2100 head-up display. Aircraft
so-equipped can now be hand-flown to a 50-foot decision height and 700-foot
runway visual range (RVR).
   Approval by the European Joint Airworthiness Authority and the FAA was
expected shortly. The certification is expected to be especially helpful to
CRJ operators in Europe, where wintertime fog and weather-related delays
frequently disrupt airline schedules and increase costs.
   The Bombardier Regional Aircraft Division's Dash 8 turboprop received
CAT IIIA certification a year ago and the aircraft-with the Flight Dynamics
HUD-is in operation in the Pacific Northwest by Horizon Air.

over the new historical, first-ever air route between Amman and Tel Aviv.
The 50-passenger turboprop also will operate between Amman and the Red Sea
port of Aqaba, Jordan. The aircraft will operate from Amman's downtown
Marka Airport under the subsidiary name of Royal Wings.
   Amman-Tel Aviv service-a distance of 67 miles-was made possible by a new
bilateral air agreement between Jordan and Israel signed in late October
1995. Details of the service were not immediately available. The 171-mile
Amman-Aqaba flights will operate twice daily. Plans to serve both
Alexandria, Egypt and Beirut were being finalized. The aircraft also will
be used in charter operations, and the company is evaluating overnight
package delivery.

AIR BALTIC NEW SAAB 340 OPERATOR

   Latvia's new flag carrier, Riga-based Air Baltic, has entered into a
lease agreement for one used Saab 340A. In the interim prior to delivery,
the carrier is wet-leasing a 340 from Swedish regional Skyways, which also
is providing technical support for the new carrier.
   Air Baltic replaces Latvia, Latvian Airlines and Baltic International as
the designated Latvian carrier. Major shareholders include the Latvian
state, Baltic International USA, SAS, the Scandinavian financial
institution Swedfund, and the Investment Fund for Central and Eastern
Europe.
   ``We will use the aircraft in the 33-seat configuration with a large
galley,'' said Air Baltic President Kjell Fredheim. ``The Saab 340 has
proved itself in cross-border service for more than a decade and is the
right size to offer increased frequencies, making Riga attractive as a
regional hub.''

downtown London City Airport with a Fokker 70. The carrier serves Paris
with the 79-passenger aircraft, making more than 30 flights weekly in each
direction.
   The service previously was provided with an ATR 42. The change
represents a 48-percent increase in capacity and results in the quickest
service between the two capitals.
   LCY is a special challenge for jet aircraft with its strict noise
limits, steep approach and short runway. The only other jet approved for
LCY service is the BAe 146/Avro series of quadjets, although the Fokker 100
make an exploratory visit to the airport in June. The manufacturer said it
would build on the F70 certification at LCY, but certification of the
larger F100 will depend on market demand.

ACA SECURES NEW FINANCING

   United Express carrier Atlantic Coast Airlines has secured a $20-million
line of credit with Shawmut Capital Corporation of Boston. The
Washington-Dulles-based carrier will use the funds to finance its
outstanding receivables, the company said.
   The three-year arrangement replaces the airline's existing credit line.
It will reduce ACA's annual interest expense and other related costs while
improving the terms of the carrier's receivable financing, it added.
   ``The financing agreement we reached with ACA is a classic example of
forging a beneficial relationship for both organizations,'' said Shawmut
Executive Vice President Ferrell Coppedge. ``For ACA, the lower financing
rates and better terms will allow them to build on the momentum of their
financial turnaround. For Shawmut, we are excited to have aligned ourselves
with a young and dynamic company that is clearly on the rise in their
industry,'' he added.

INDUSTRY FALLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE TO CONQUER SAFETY CHALLENGES

By:
James Ott

   The internal workings of commercial aviation-from flight operations to
aircraft maintenance and beyond-will fall increasingly under a microscope
as industry shoulders the safety challenges of the future.
   This message rang out clearly in several key presentations offered by
FAA and industry representatives at The McGraw-Hill Companies' Aviation
Week Group Chicago `95 Conference and Exhibit November 1 to 3. More than
150 participants and industry leaders from around the world discussed the
challenges ahead.
   Improving the margin of safety in U.S. aviation has become a primary
objective of government, industry and labor. Reducing the accident rate
will become increasingly urgent in view of the 40-percent increase in
direct flights expected over the next 10 to 15 years, FAA Administrator
David Hinson said.
   ``If we only manage to maintain today's low accident rate, the estimated
growth in aviation will increase the number of jet crashes worldwide to
about one a week,'' Hinson said, quoting the results of a Boeing Company
study.
   The FAA is in the process of implementing 173 detailed safety
initiatives that emerged from 1994's agency-sponsored Aviation Safety
Conference. The conference was prompted by a rare spate of accidents
including several involving regional carriers. Hinson singled out as a
foremost achievement of that conference the industry agreement that allows
the FAA access to data from airline flight operations.
   ``I hope this agreement will lay the groundwork for a much more
comprehensive international data exchange, which will make safety data
instantly available, onine, to aviation professionals everywhere in the
world,'' Hinson said.
   U.S. carriers are initiating programs of Flight Operations Quality
Assurance (FOQA) as part of this safety drive. Under these programs,
information from flight data recorders is being collected and analyzed. The
FAA and airlines are working out a method for the FAA to access the
information.
   Christopher Hart, assistant FAA administrator for system safety and a
panelist discussing ``Safety: Danger Zones of the Future,'' said the
analysis of airline operational data will allow the FAA to become
``proactive'' in safety. He predicts a cultural shift in the FAA toward the
prevention of unsafe operations and away from its traditional role of
enforcer of regulations.
   Hinson said the incident and accident data now compiled by the FAA are
``all anecdotal'' and virtually useless. Hart said the new emphasis lay on
analysis of greater quantities of data. The airlines and the FAA are now
working out ways to access the information.
   The Flight Safety Foundation has long advocated that airline management
should establish corporate safety departments and create a ``safety
culture'' within each carrier. It also has encouraged nonpunitive
approaches to accident and incident investigations. FSF president and chief
executive officer Stuart Matthews, another panelist, said that quality
assurance programs will act as an accident intervention strategy.
   ``The trends and subtle errors identified by this method, properly fed
back into briefings, training programs andmanagement policies, complement
the maintenance trend-analysis programs and can substantially reduce the
opportunities for error,'' he told the conference.
   Ove Dahlen, chairman of Saab Aircraft of America, noted that operations
data analysis has been conducted routinely and successfully by military air
forces. He also raised the point that, because of two accidents, the
regional/commuter industry was unfairly billed as unsafe and a motivating
cause of the Aviation Safety Conference. The record amply shows quite the
reverse: that commuter flying is safe, he said.
   The Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) program underway at Delta
Air Lines was described as a prime example of what is happening in
industry. Delta has consolidated safety operations into one office under
John Lauber, vice president of corporate safety and compliance.
   Lauber studied human factors as causes of accidents while at NASA and
later applied the concept in his crash investigative work as a two-term
member of the NTSB. Under Lauber, Delta has founded a Safety Council and
extended the reach of that council to a companion group that serves the
Delta Connection Carriers.
   Delta's safety program applies across the board and has been expanded to
include air and ground operations. Techniques used in crew resource
management (CRM) in which human factors come into play are being applied to
other kinds of work beyond the cockpit. Formal investigations of all
accidents and incidents are undertaken. The airline has adopted the
nonpunitive approach recommended by the FSF to the investigations.
   The human factors mission, Lauber told the group, was to:
   -- Foster a barrier-free working climate that inspires trust, teamwork,
quality and pride;
   -- Give everyone a stake in the operation and its outcome; and
   -- Push responsibility and authority down-foster accountability at all
levels.
   John O'Brien, director of engineering and safety for the Air Line Pilots
Association, said the FAA proposal to adopt Part 121 safety standards for
commuter/regional aircraft was a step in the right direction but still
falls short of ALPA's One Level of Safety program.
   ``But to clearly achieve One Level of Safety in this proposal, the FAA
must adopt a new attitude, one of taking valid ideas and using them because
they are correct,'' O'Brien said.
   He recommended the FAA: extend the Part 121 safety standards to
scheduled air cargo carriers; outline specific duties for safety directors;
reduce phase-in times for aircraft equipment modifications; provide both
pilots in the cockpit with airport and navigation charts; phase out
operations of certain small commuter aircraft models that do not meet
higher standards; strengthen requirements for emergency evacuation
demonstrations and for smoke detectors and fire suppression; require use of
TCAS II collision avoidance devices rather than TCAS I; improve training
requirements; boost standards and equipment for small airports used by
commuters; phase-in application of the age 60 mandatory retirement rule for
commuter pilots; and continue with plans to strengthen flight time limits
for all types of operators.
   During the conference, Henri Wassenbergh, the aviation scholar and
former Netherlands negotiator, received the L. Welch Pogue award from the
Aviation Week Group in recognition of his contributions to advancing the
cause of liberalization in international aviation.
   In his tenure as a Netherlands negotiator, Wassenbergh espoused free
trade in aviation. He was one of the inventors of country-of-origin
pricing, which became a commonly accepted article of bilateral aviation
agreements. He also conceived of the ``double disapproval'' provision for
agreements. Under that provision, low fares are encouraged and remain in
effect until each of the participants in a two-party agreement act to
withdraw them.
   The Pogue award, created by the Aviation Week Group, is named for the
Washington, D.C. resident who served U.S. aviation interests as an
appointee of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Pogue was named chairman of
the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) prior to World War II, and was appointed
a U.S. delegate to the 1944 international conference that authorized the
Chicago Convention, the legal framework for establishing rules of the air
and aviation standards through the ICAO.

BUSINESS AIRCRAFT SALES

   (January 1995 - November 1995)
Retail deliveries of turbine aircraft showed another uptick in November-a
lift that resulted from an 11.8 percent jump in worldwide sales of new jets
and turboprops in contrast to a 10.0 percent decline in resales.
And although the total number of sales of new and previously owned turbines
dropped 7.6 percent from 1994's 11-month total, the picture continued to
steadily improve.
   Preliminary data show U.S. sales of new aircraft rose 20.3 percent
through November, according to Wichita-based AvData. Domestic deliveries of
previoulsy owned turbines fell 7.4 percent behind last year's total.
   Revised U.S. data through October showed new and used turbine sales up
0.5 percent over last year including a 31.7 percent surge in new aircraft
sales and only a 2.8 percent drop in the used market.
   International sales during the first 11 months of 1995 dropped 29.2
percent below 1994's total. Deliveries of all new turbines fell 6.8 percent
while resales dropped by more than a third. Aggregate shortfalls
notwithstanding, preliminary reports through November showed sales of new
turboprops had already surpassed last year's annual total.
   Updated October figures revealed total sales outside the United States
declined 25.4 percent overall. New aircraft deliveries fell 4.9 percent
short of 1994's 10-month tally while resales were down 29.5 percent.
   AvData compilations encompass only sales to retail customers. Dealer and
broker transactions are not included. Monthly revisions reflect additional
information as it becomes available.

THE EMB 145: REGIONAL JET OR TURBOPROP SANS PROPS?
Embraer's new regional jet will not give the Canadair Regional Jet much of
a competitive tussle; the Saab 2000 is another story.

By:
Arnold Lewis

   The Embraer EMB-145 was originally conceived in early 1989 as a
45-passenger, stretched Brasilia designed to meet the growth needs of the
American Eagle carriers in the mid-1990s.
20 AMR Eagle took 50 options on the 50-passenger Saab 2000 high-speed
turboprop, and that was ostensibly the end of that competition. Ironically,
the 145 has rolled out and is in flight test as a 50-passenger regional
jet, and AMR Eagle still has not exercised any options for the Saab 2000.
Indeed, competition between the two aircraft may only be beginning.
20 Three months after AMR took its Saab 2000 options, the 145 re-emerged
as a regional jet. But it still looked like a turboprop. The nacelles
rested atop the basic Brasilia wing, which included a chord extension at
the leading edge and a super-critical airfoil with a 14-percent root
thickness; the nacelles simply contained a turbofan rather than a
turboprop. Embraer engineers reckoned that the configuration would save the
buyer $3 million in price over aft-mounted turbofans, which would have
required a redesign of the wing and the main landing gear installation.
Engineers were looking for improved field performance resulting from the
``blown-wing'' effect.
20 Engineers reasoned that the configuration would also minimize
foreign-object damage, reduce inlet-airflow distortion and diminish the
fly-over noise signature due to engine shielding by the wing. ``It will not
be the fastest regional jet, but it certainly will be the most
economical,'' said then-Embraer Chief Executive Ozilio da Silva. His
comparison was the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ).
20 The problem was that wind-tunnel testing showed that the configuration
resulted in compressibility problems that would offset hoped-for
performance results. The engineers went to an under-wing engine
installation with a swept-wing, similar to the Boeing 737's. That met
performance requirements, but produced ground-clearance and maintenance
problems at the same time. In addition, commonality with the Brasilia was
diminished.

ENGINES MOVED AFT
   When Embraer's founding chief executive, Ozires Silva, returned to the
company in 1991 from a five-year hiatus as president of state-owned oil
company Petrobras and a stint in Brasilia as super-minister of
infrastructure, he ``moved the engines to the tail and put firm controls on
the aircraft specs. The letters of intent were based on firm specs,
especially operating costs and weight of structure,'' he told B/CA in a
recent interview (December 1995, page C6).
20 Ozires is proud of the fact that the airplane met its forecast
specifications, even down to the pound. In terms of maximum takeoff weight,
the 145 is 8,672 pounds lighter than the CRJ, and 7,937 pounds less than
the Saab 2000. Its zero-fuel weight is 6,302 pounds less than the CRJ and
5,702 less than the 2000-for the same number of passenger seats. The CRJ
numbers are for the extended-range version, for which most customers are
opting.
20 ``Published'' prices of the Saab 2000 and EMB-145 are identical at
$14.5 million each. The CRJ comes in at $18.6 million. Based on empty
operating weight, those prices equate to $480, $568 and $617 per pound,
respectively. Put another way, the 2000 and 145 come in at $290,000 per
passenger seat each, and the CRJ at $372,000 per seat.
20 Other than the fact that one is a turboprop and the other a
turbofan-albeit powered by the same Allison Engine Company core turbine-the
Saab 2000 and EMB-145 are amazingly similar in terms of performance and
productivity (see chart). B/CA measures productivity by operating aircraft
over continuous segments of 150, 275, 400 and 800 statute miles,
respectively, within the confines of a 14-hour duty day.
20 Optimum climb and cruise is selected for each aircraft, as is cruise
altitude. Ten minutes are used for taxi and takeoff, with descent to sea
level and no allowance for approach and landing. The profile allows for a
45-minute hold plus a 30-minute diversion, all at cruise altitude and
speed, which produces an apples-to-apples comparison.

TURBOPROP TOPS SHORT HOPS
   In the 150-sm mission, the Saab 2000 produces 13 total segments and
97,500 total available seat miles. Block speed is 195 knots with a block
fuel burn of 990 pounds. Both the 145 and the CRJ produce 14 daily segments
over the relatively short stage length and turn in an identical 105,000
seat miles. Block speeds are 219 and 226 knots, respectively, and block
fuel is 1,222 and 1,325 pounds, respectively. (All EMB-145 data used in
this comparison are preliminary.)
   At 275 sm, the CRJ jumps out ahead, with 12 daily trips compared to 10
each for the 2000 and 145. Seat-mile production is 165,000 for the CRJ
versus 137,500 each for the 2000 and 145. The CRJ produces a block speed of
309 knots, compared to 246 for the 2000 and 265 for the 145.
20 Seat-mile production for the 2000 and the 145 are identical as well at
400 and 800 sm, at 160,000 and 200,000, respectively. The CRJ produces
200,000 seat miles at 400 miles and 240,000 at 800 miles.
20 Mileage production is not the only factor, however. Field distance
tips the scales to the turboprop. The Saab 2000, despite a takeoff weight
higher than the 145's, turns in an SL/ISA balanced field length of less
than 4,400 feet. That compares to more than 4,900 feet for the 145 and more
than 6,000 for the CRJ. Bump those airport conditions up to 5,000 feet and
ISA+ 20C, and the distances jump to 6,100, 8,450 and 9,900 feet,
respectively.
20 All-engine climb rates for the 2000 and 145 are identical at 2,380
feet per minute, compared to 3,200 fpm for the CRJ. Cruise speeds at
optimum altitude for the 2000, 145 and CRJ produced block speeds of 280,
350 and 370 knots, respectively.
20 But in terms of tankering fuel-when contract fuel is not available at
the outstations, the 2000 produced seven stages per fueling in the 150-sm
mission, versus three each for the 145 and CRJ. At 275 sm, the spread was
three, two and three, respectively. It is two stages across the board at
400 sm and one, one and two at 800 sm.

31-INCH PITCH VS. FOUR-ABREAST
   The 2000 has the advantage on seat pitch at 32 inches versus 31 inches
for the two jets. It also tops the 145 in cross-section-7.1 feet compared
to 6.9 for the 145 and 8.4 for the CRJ. The latter offers four-abreast
seating versus three each for the 2000 and the 145. All are derivatives of
earlier aircraft, the Saab 340, EMB-120 Brasilia and Canadair Challenger
business jet, respectively.
20 Embraer officials like to talk about their ``back to basics'' approach
to the design and development of the 145. They have good reason. The
earlier CBA-123 pusher-turboprop development program-a 70/30 partnership
with Argentina's Fabrica Militar de Aviones (FMA)-was a financial disaster.
The 19-passenger aircraft had all the bells and whistles, and the costs
rocketed. Realistic price estimates ranged from $6 million to $8 million.
That compares with around $4 million for existing 19-passenger aircraft.
20 With Ozires Silva back at the helm, operating costs and weight became
primary considerations in the development of the 145, as well as the ``back
to basics'' rationale-''technology in the right measure to meet with the
demands of operators worldwide.'' That rationale was based on four
actions:
   -- Take advantage of state-of-the-art technology while aiming at
reducing costs;
   -- Maximize commonality with the EMB-120 Brasilia and CBA-123
Vector;
   -- Apply concurrent engineering to avoid modifications during the
production phase; and
   -- Make comprehensive, extensive use of the latest CAD tools, such as
the use of electronic mock-ups, to reduce production costs. The company
said that over 20,000 computerized drawings were generated in EMB-145
development.

MANY RISK-SHARERS
   The manufacturer also made extensive use of risk-sharing partnerships to
spread the cost of development. Estimated at $300 million, the cost was
split as follows: 33 percent from risk-sharing partners, 10 percent from
participating suppliers, 23 percent from Brazilian development funding
institutions, and 34 percent from Embraer itself.
20 The risk-sharing partners are:
   -- Gamesa of Spain-wings and nacelles, in association with INS of
Northern Ireland; and wing-to-fuselage fairings, main landing gear doors
and leading edges, in association with Sonaca of Belgium.
   -- C&D Interiors of the United States-passenger cabin/cargo compartment
interiors.
   -- Sonaca of Belgium-center fuselage, main door, service door, rear
fuselage, pylons and baggage door.
   -- Enaer of Chile-vertical fin, horizontal stabilizer and elevators.
20 There are some 28 U.S. suppliers for the 145 in non-risk-sharing
capacities, not the least of which is Allison Engine Company. Embraer was
the launch customer for the AE3007, although Cessna got the engine airborne
first on the Citation X business jet.
20 The 145 installation calls for 7,475 pounds of maximum takeoff thrust,
or an alternate takeoff rating of 6,930 pounds. It is a 5:1 high-bypass
turbofan with one accessory gearbox driven by the gas-generator spool. The
gas generator spool incorporates a 14-stage compressor driven by a
two-stage turbine. The installation incorporates Full Authority Digital
Engine Controls (FADEC) without mechanical back-up.
20 An AlliedSignal auxiliary power unit is mounted in the tail as
standard equipment. It supplies pressurized air for the aircraft pneumatic
system and is an electrical power source either simultaneously or
independently from the aircraft electrical system.
20 Up front, the 145 offers what Embraer calls a ``quiet and dark''
cockpit, designed for crew comfort during all phases of flight. The
avionics system is the Honeywell Primus 1000 and incorporates a five-tube,
eight- by seven-inch glass cockpit. Primary Flight Displays (PFDs) are at
the far left and right of the panel, framing dual Multi-Function Displays
(MFDs) for navigation displays, weather radar and TCAS advisories. They
also can show maintenance data as well as checklists. The center unit is
dedicated to EICAS primary indications.

COMPOSITES EMPLOYED
   The 145 incorporates a fair amount of composites. Wing panels and
control surfaces, and landing-gear doors are either carbon/Nomex or
carbon/Kev-lar. Interior panels, radome and wing-to-fuselage fairings are
of fiberglass or fiberglass/Nomex. The vertical-fin leading edge and
fairing is Kevlar or a combination of that and fiberglass or Nomex.
Interior flooring is a sandwich panel of either carbon/Nomex or
fiberglass/Nomex.
20 The basic airframe structure is of aluminum construction with formed
sheet, machined and extruded parts. Chemical milling is used extensively
for a better fatigue/weight combination. The structure is designed to meet
damage-tolerance criteria except for the landing gear, where the safe-life
concept is applied. The structure is designed for 75,000 flight hours or
60,000 cycles.
20 Four aircraft will be engaged in a 13-month, 1,300-hour certification
flight-test program that actually got under- way prior to the airplane's
official rollout in August 1995. They will be the prototype-Serial Number
801-plus three pre-production series aircraft-Serial Number 001, 002 and
003. The latter will later be refurbished and sold in the market. Two other
structures-Serial Number 802 and 803-will be used in static and fatigue
tests. Certification and initial customer delivery will take place late
this year.
20 The initial production rate will be three per month, to be reached in
1998, but that rate can be increased to a maximum of four per month. The
company plans to build 24 this year. Officials during a rollout went out on
a limb by suggesting that the program could break even at between 200 and
250 airplanes. Predicting break-even production, however, is a
``never-never land'' seldom reached. Still, the company expects to secure
40 percent of what it says is a worldwide market for 1,000 fast regional
aircraft over the next 10 years, with two-thirds of that market in the
United States.
20 There are only 18 firm orders, plus 16 options, for the
airplane-Flight West of Australia and Regional Airlines of France are the
early customers. But the manufacturer and the Brazilian government are
still engaged in establishing a government-backed financial scheme to
support the sales (B/CA, December 1995, page C6).
20 Embraer sees its customer base as current operators of the EMB-120
Brasilia. Indeed, prominent during rollout ceremonies in August were
executives of Delta Connection carriers Comair and SkyWest, both large
Brasilia fleet operators that also operate the CRJ.
20 One told B/CA that it is a perception thing. ``The perception is that
turboprops are small airplanes.''

WIND-SHEAR ENCOUNTER AT CHARLOTTE
Despite the presence of airborne and ground wind-shear detection systems,
Flight 1016 came to grief in an unanticipated microburst.

By:
Richard N. Aarons

   We've all heard that accidents usually befall us not because of a single
catastrophic event, but rather as the culmination of the unidirectional
alignment of a long series of relatively benign events. There is no better
example of this phenomenon than the loss of USAir Flight 1016 in a
wind-shear encounter on July 2, 1994 at Charlotte/Douglas International
Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thirty-seven passengers were killed,
and 14 others were seriously injured when the DC-9-31 collided with trees
and a private residence as the pilots attempted to execute a missed
approach from the Runway 18R ILS. The captain and first officer, one flight
attendant and one passenger suffered minor injuries.
   The NTSB said the probable causes of this accident were:
   (1) The flightcrew's decision to continue an approach into severe
convective activity that was conducive to a microburst,
   (2) The flightcrew's failure to recognize a wind-shear situation in a
timely manner,
   (3) The flightcrew's failure to establish and maintain the proper
airplane attitude and thrust setting necessary to escape the wind shear,
and
   (4) The lack of real-time adverse weather and wind-shear hazard
information dissemination from ATC.
   All of these factors led to an encounter with, and failure to escape
from, a microburst-induced wind shear that was produced by a rapidly
developing thunderstorm located at the approach end of Runway 18R.
   Contributing to the accident, said the Safety Board, were:
   -- The lack of ATC procedures that would have required the controller
to display and issue ASR-9 radar weather information to the pilots of
flight 1016,
   -- Charlotte tower supervisor's failure to properly advise and ensure
that all controllers were aware of and reporting a reduction in visibility
and the runway visual range (RVR) value information along with the
low-level wind-shear alerts that had occurred in multiple quadrants,
   -- The inadequate remedial actions by USAir to ensure adherence to
standard operating procedures, and
   -- The inadequate software logic in the airplane's wind-shear warning
system that did not provide an alert upon entry into the wind shear.
   In addition to the causal factors, the NTSB made the additional
observation that this accident occurred despite the following aspects in
the flight's favor:
   (1) The flightcrew had received extensive training on CRM techniques as
well as wind-shear avoidance and escape;
   (2) The airplane was equipped with modern wind-shear detection and
escape avionics;
   (3) The airport was equipped with a low-level wind-shear alerting
system;
   (4) ATC personnel were looking at a mean thunderstorm with a
sophisticated ASR-9 scope and with their eyeballs;
   (5) The aircraft had enough power to climb out of the microburst it
encountered; and
   (6) The flightcrew ultimately made the proper decision to abort the
approach.
   To understand what happened, you need a feeling for the timeline. NTSB
investigators put it together this way:
   The crew began a planned three-day sequence from Pittsburgh (PIT) at
0945 hours on the morning of the accident. The trip segments for the day
included en route stops at La Guardia (LGA), Charlotte (CLT) and Columbia,
South Carolina (CAE), followed by a return trip to CLT and a final stop in
Memphis (MEM). The accident oc-curred on the fourth leg from CAE to CLT
while the first officer was performing the duties of the flying pilot.
   The flight departed CAE on schedule at 1823 hours. The forecast weather
for CLT was pretty much as it had been when the crew cycled through the CLT
hub earlier that afternoon, except for the additional notation of
``scattered thunderstorms in the area.'' A minute after the airplane broke
ground for the 35-minute flight, the captain made contact with Charlotte
TRACON's arrival west controller and reported the crew had ATIS for CLT.
   During the short en route leg at 12,000 feet, the cockpit voice recorder
(CVR) picked up routine ATC and cockpit discussions, including indications
that crewmembers were analyzing radar returns and planning their arrival
thoughtfully. Six minutes after departure, the first officer commented,
``There's more rain than I thought there was . . . it's starting . . .
pretty good a minute ago . . . now it's held up.'' A minute later, the
captain radioed the approach controller and stated, ``We're gonna swing
just five degrees to the right here just for about uh a quarter . . . half
mile.'' The controller approved the request.
   As they approached the Charlotte area from the south-southwest,
crewmembers observed two cells on their airborne weather radar-one located
south and the second located east of the airport. The radar return from the
cell south of the airport had a red center surrounded by yellow edges.
   At 1832 hours, the captain began a three-minute conversation with the
arrival controller about possible deviations as the aircraft maneuvered for
the approach. The flight was issued a clearance to descend to 6,000 feet,
and was switched to the final radar west (FRW) controller who cleared it on
down to 4,000 feet and told it to expect Runway 18R.
   The captain acknowledged the transmission, and then stated to the first
officer, ``Approach brief.'' The first officer responded, ``visual back up
ILS.'' The controller then issued a clearance to Flight 1016 to ``. . .
turn 10 degrees right, descend and maintain two thousand three hundred,
vectors visual approach runway one eight right.'' About this same time, the
tower supervisor made the remark in the tower cab that it was ``raining
like hell at the south end of the airport, and the FEW controller looked at
the airport surveillance radar (ASR-9) and observed a VIP level-three cell
``pop-up'' near the airport.
   At 1836:55, ``the FRW controller radioed flight 1016 and said, ``I'll
tell you what USAir ten sixteen, they got some rain just south of the
field, might be a little bit coming off north, just expect the ILS now,
amend your altitude maintain three thousand.'' The USAir captain
acknowledged the transmission.
   Meanwhile, on another frequency, the local east controller was warning
an arriving DHC-8 of ``heavy, heavy rain on the airport now, wind one five
zero at one four.'' At this point, the FRW controller turned Flight 1016
onto the final approach course, and told the crew to maintain 3,000 to the
marker and then contact the tower. The crew had visual contact with the
airport and could see rain.
   While Flight 1016 was still with the FRW controller, USAir 806 was
taxiing for takeoff and discussing the weather with a local controller.
``And [this is] eight-o-six, looks like we've gotten a storm right on the
top of the field here.'' The local controller responded, ``affirmative.''
   In the cockpit of Flight 1016, the captain told the first officer, ``If
we have to bail out . . . it looks like we bail out to the right.'' This
was followed by the captain saying, ``chance of shear.''
   At 1839:38, the captain checked in with the local controller, who
replied, ``USAir ten sixteen . . . runway one eight right, cleared to land
following an F-K one hundred short final. Previous arrival [USAir 677, a
Fokker FK-28 that landed about four minutes earlier] reported a smooth ride
all the way down the final.'' The captain responded, ``USAir ten sixteen,
I'd appreciate a PIREP from that guy in front of us. [The airplane
referenced by the captain of Flight 1016 was USAir Flight 984, a Fokker
FK-100 that had circled from Runway 23 to land on 18R.] The LCW controller
relayed the report of a ``smooth ride'' to Flight 1016.
   Later the captain and first officer testified that the ``edge of the
rain'' was a ``thin veil'' through which they could see the runway, and it
was located ``between us and the runway.''
   About 1836 hours, a special weather observation was recorded, and a new
ATIS was prepared, reporting a thunderstorm on the airport. The information
was not broadcast until 1843 hours. The flightcrew of USAir 1016 never
received it.
   At 1840:37, the LCE controller advised USAir Flight 52, a Boeing 737
departing Runway 18L, ``. . . aircraft just departed ahead of you said
smooth ride on departure wind is one zero zero at one niner gusting two
one.'' USAir Flight 52 was then issued a takeoff clearance.
   At 1840:50, the LCW controller said, ``USAir ten sixteen, wind now one
one zero at two one.''
   At 1841:05, the CVR recorded the captain saying, ``stay heads up,'' and
the LCW controller's radio transmission of ``wind-shear alert northeast
boundary, wind one nine zero at one three.'' Meanwhile, at 1841:08, the LCE
controller had transmitted, ``attention all aircraft, wind-shear alert, the
surface wind one zero at two zero, northeast boundary wind one nine zero at
one six.'' However, the LACE radio transmission occurred on a different
radio frequency and was not heard by the crew of Flight 1016.
   At 1841:17, the LCW controller issued a landing clearance to the
aircraft following Flight 1016, and also reported that the wind was ``. . .
one zero zero at two zero, wind-shear alert northeast boundary wind, one
niner zero at one seven.'' At 1841:54, the CVR recorded the captain's
comment ``here come the wipers,'' followed three seconds later by the sound
of rain.
   The first officer commented, ``There's, ooh, 10 knots right there.''
This was followed by the captain saying, ``Okay, you're plus 20 [knots] . . .
take it around, go to the right.'' The NTSB later concluded that the
captain was unaware that the airplane had penetrated the first part of a
microburst and, therefore, commanded the first officer to execute a
standard missed approach rather than a wind-shear escape procedure. The
captain would later recall that the airplane was about 450 feet agl when he
ordered the missed approach. The flight data recorder (FDR) tape indicated
the airplane was closer to 200 feet agl at that time.
   The flight had 21 seconds to go before impact.
   The captain radioed ``USAir ten sixteen's on the go,'' and then said,
``max power.'' The first officer said, ``yeah max power.''The FDR recorded
an increase in engine power to 1.82 EPR, which actually was below the
standard go-around limit of 1.93. The first officer had established the
appropriate 15-degree nose-up attitude and had begun to enter a
17-degree-banked turn to the right.
   The tower controller, said, ``USAir ten sixteen, understand you're on
the go sir, fly runway heading, climb and maintain three thousand.''
The first officer called for ``flaps to fifteen.'' Two seconds later, the
captain said to the first officer, ``down, push it down'' and then radioed
to the tower controller, ``up to three we're taking a right turn.''
The tower controller responded, ``USAir ten sixteen, understand you're
turning right.''
   Then, the CVR recorded the GPWS aural alert (whoop, whoop, terrain), and
an unidentified voice calling ``power.'' Over the next two seconds, the CVR
picked up sounds similar to a stick-shaker activation, and then sounds of
ground impact.
   Later analysis showed that Flight 1016 encountered a microburst about
six seconds after initiating the missed approach from Runway 18R. The
microburst was generated by convective activity that was centered near the
east side of Runway 18R and that had cloud tops at 30,000 feet. It was
about 3.5 kilometers in diameter and was capable of producing a rainfall
rate of about 10 inches per hour. Total wind change near the ground was
about 75 knots, with the strongest downward vertical winds, below 300 feet
agl, calculated to be 600 fpm to 1,200 fpm. Pilots on the ground and in the
air reported that the thunderstorm appeared as a small echo approximately
three miles in diameter, and indicated ``mostly red'' on the radar.
   Computations indicate that during the initial climb, after the missed
approach was initiated and during the final descent (to within two to three
seconds of ground impact), the wind along the flight path changed
significantly. Computations revealed that the wind shifted from a headwind
of about 35 knots to a tailwind of about 26 knots in 15 seconds. The
vertical-velocity component of the wind field was also examined, and it was
determined that the vertical-wind velocity increased from about 600
fpm-down to about 1,500 fpm-down, and increased further to 1,800 fpm-down
as the airplane attained its maximum altitude and made the transition into
a descent.
   Safety Board investigators, using simulators to explore DC-9-31
performance limits, determined the accident aircraft could have flown out
of this microburst if the first officer had maintained a 15-degree nose-up
pitch, and if the power had been set properly. But the first officer
responded to the captain's command of ``down, push it down,'' thus changing
the aircraft's pitch attitude from 15-degrees nose-up to five-degrees
nose-down over a seven-second period.
   Why did the captain give this command? The investigators don't know,
because the captain testified that he did not recall issuing it. However,
the Safety Board believes a likely explanation is that during the last
minute of flight, the captain-upon losing his visual cues instantaneously
when the airplane encountered heavy rain-could have experienced a form of
spatial disorientation.
   This disorientation, said the NTSB, ``might have led him to believe that
the aircraft was climbing at an excessively high rate and that the pitch
attitude should be lowered to prevent an aerodynamic stall.'' When the
airplane encountered the heavy rain, said the investigators, the flightcrew
would have lost their outside horizon visual reference. Also, it might not
have been possible for the captain to regain situational focus on the
primary flight instruments because he was performing other tasks.
   Further, because the flightcrew was initiating the missed approach
(which involved a large increase in engine thrust, a pronounced increase in
pitch attitude, and a banked turn to the right), the crew would have been
exposed to significant linear and angular accelerative forces. These forces
could have stimulated the flightcrew's vestibular and proprioceptive
systems, and produced a form of spatial disorientation known as
somatogravic illusion.
   How about the first officer's actions? The Safety Board analyzed them
this way: As the flying pilot, the first officer would have maintained a
scan of several instruments. These instruments would have given him the
best situational awareness by providing essential information about
airspeed, altitude and attitude. However, he reacted to the captain's
command without challenging it. One of the principles in the practice of
crew resource management (CRM) is the uninhibited challenge of the captain
by the first officer when an unsafe condition exists or an inappropriate
command has been issued.
   The Safety Board ``believes that the first officer should have been
fully aware of the airplane's proximity to the ground when the captain
commanded the missed approach [200 feet agl], as well as their altitude
[350 feet agl] when the captain commanded, `Down, push it down.' Thus, the
first officer's immediate reaction should have been to challenge the
impropriety of the command rather than reacting first.''
   The NTSB felt that the flightcrew members' comfortable working
relationship set up the environment for the CRM failure. For example, they
had conducted casual conversations during parts of the flight in which
sterile cockpit procedures should have been in effect; they violated
company SOPs in the way they conducted checklists and briefings; and,
together, they lost situational awareness in the end.
   Of course, they were getting a lot of help in the negative sense from
everything else that was happening (or not happening) at the time. For
example, most of the ATC-pilot chatter about the developing cell was on
other frequencies, not the ones they were working. The low-level wind-shear
alerts were not sufficiently transmitted to them. All of their simulator
training had associated wind shear with turbulence, and no turbulence
occurred in this microburst event. And, the wind-shear detection system on
board did not function properly and did not warn crewmembers of the
encounter.
   The NTSB issued several recommendations to the FAA after its
investigation into this accident. Most are on the subject of getting
weather information from various ATC positions to the cockpit. Other
recommendations call for improving training to emphasize the importance of
CRM and sterile cockpit concepts. Still others have to do with the software
problems that caused the airborne wind-shear detection system to fail.
   This accident, like most, simply should not have happened, yet it did.
And that's the lesson we must take away from it. As we've seen, all human
and mechanical systems designed to prevent such mishaps failed in this
incident.
   In the end, we are reminded that flying airplanes requires us to be ever
vigilant.
