<H3>3. Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS) Provide Important Consumer 
Information</H3>

<BR>
Every year, 3.5 million homes in America change hands. Every transfer 
offers an opportunity to retrofit homes with energy-efficiency measures. 
When buying a home, consumers typically only have enough information to 
base their decision on the home's first costs. But the life-cycle energy 
costs of a home, like a car or appliance, are important values that make a 
substantial difference in the real cost - and value - of a home.<P>
<B><I> <p>     DOE's Five-Star Rating Program.</I> </B>The U.S. DOE has 
developed a uniform home energy rating system that evaluates the 
efficiency of residences on a 100-point scale. The most efficient house 
receives 100 points ("five stars plus"), indicating a home that is roughly 
two times as efficient as one built to the specifications of the 1993 
Model Energy Code.209 In mid-1995, DOE proposed the program as a national 
standard, with voluntary adoption left to the states. States should be 
encouraged to implement the program, which will offer buyers essential 
information about the life-cycle energy costs of a potential home 
purchase.<p>      <BR>
<p>    <p>      Uniform Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS), nationwide, will 
remove market barriers to financing for energy-efficiency investments. The 
real estate industry, and most consumers, fail to recognize the life-cycle 
market value of efficiency investments. Lenders are generally unwilling to 
loan more dollars for more efficient houses, even though those households 
have greater disposable income due to lower energy bills. Uniform 
efficiency ratings will help standardize the real estate efficiency 
market, enabling lenders and utilities to expand energy loan programs and 
increase consumer demand.<a href="#210" name="r210"> [ 210 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="EnergyRatedHomesofAmerica">Energy Rated Homes of America <a> </B></I>The private sector 
has also taken on HERS. "Energy Rated Homes of America" also uses a 
100-point scale and provides an "as-is" rating for each home it 
evaluates.<a href="#211" name="r211"> [ 211 ] </a>An "improvement-options" rating is also provided, which 
indicates how the home would rate, and the potential savings, if fully 
detailed retrofit measures were installed. Thus the process of rating a 
home not only provides a score, but provides the home owner with 
cost-effective, suggested improvements. The funds necessary to carry out 
these improvements can be added to mortgages - discussed 
below - allowing inefficient homes to be upgraded and the cost of 
improvements financed over the life of the loan.<a href="#212" name="r212"> [ 212 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     The Austin, Texas "Energy Star Program."</B></I> Austin's 
Energy Star Program is a similar new-home HERS program. The rating 
compares a particular energy-efficient home to the same home if it were 
built to minimum code standards. A one-star home<a href="#213" name="r213"> [ 213 ] </a>saves approximately 6 
percent more energy than the base (code-built) home; a two-star home<a href="#214" name="r214"> [ 214 ] </a>
saves about 15 percent; and a three-star home<a href="#215" name="r215"> [ 215 ] </a>represents more than 23 
percent energy savings. Austin has marketed the Energy Star Program 
especially toward volume builders, who typically are conscious of small 
incremental cost increases per unit and historically have been less 
inclined to meet efficiency levels much above code requirements. Austin 
has been able to get more than 40 builders to join the Energy Star 
Program - a majority of the builders in the Austin area. The builders 
have become so actively involved in the program that, according to Doug 
Seiter, Energy Star Program manager for the city, they are "changing their 
design plans just to get better ratings. They've been joining because it 
makes them competitive."<a href="#216" name="r216"> [ 216 ] </a>In the 12 months preceding October 1, 1990, 
the program had given Energy Star ratings to 622 homes, representing 50 to 
60 percent of that year's new residential building stock. These homes 
saved more than 1 million kilowatt-hours that year - enough electricity 
to serve more than 100 homes for a year. Projected electricity savings are 
estimated to be $143,060, an average of $230 per home. Just these 622 
homes saved 704 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions during 1990.<a href="#217" name="r217"> [ 217 ] </a>
