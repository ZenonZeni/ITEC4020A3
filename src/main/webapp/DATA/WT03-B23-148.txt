		<P>
				The U.S. government is the single largest borrower in the U.S.
				long-term bond market and is considered by investors to be the
				most reliable borrower in the world. U.S. Treasury securities
				constitute U.S. government obligations and are guaranteed by the
				full faith and credit of the government. Since there are no limitations
				on the government's ability to pay its interest, Treasury securities
				are considered to be the safest investment.

		<P>
				The Treasury offers three types of securities: U.S. Treasury bills,
				U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasury bills are
				non-interest-bearing, discounted securities with an original maturity
				of one year or less. The interest is received at maturity, and
				is equal to the difference between the face value received and
				the purchase price. Treasury notes are intermediate securities
				with maturities ranging from one to 10 years and Treasury bonds
				are long-term bonds with maturities ranging from 10 to 30
				years. Both Treasury notes and bonds are marketable securities
				that pay interest semiannually. Because of their excellent marketability and 
				credit rating and their low risk, Treasury securities generally return a yield 
				lower than other types of fixed-income securities.
		<P>
				There are several reasons why Treasury securities are popular
				with investors:
				<UL>
				<LI><B>Safety</B> --- A direct obligation of the government,
				Treasury securities are considered the safest fixed-income investment
				in the world.</LI>
				</UL>
		<P>
				<UL>
				<LI><B>Tax Advantages</B> --- Treasuries are exempt from state and local
				taxes, which make them particularly attractive if you live in a
				state with high taxes.</LI>
				</UL>
		<P>
				<UL>
				<LI><B>Liquidity</B> --- If you decide to sell your securities
				before the maturity date, the secondary market for Treasuries
				is one of the largest in the world.</LI>
				</UL>
		<P>
				<UL>
				<LI><B>Predictability</B> --- In most cases, you can obtain a favorable
				interest rate for the life of the security. Unlike other types
				of bonds, such as corporates and municipals, the majority of Treasuries
				are non-callable. That feature means they cannot be redeemed for payment
				by the issuer before the maturity date.</LI>
