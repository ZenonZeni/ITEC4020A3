	<p>Electric and hybrid-electric vehicle development is truly a national phenomenon, with commercial and military activities firmly moving in all corners of the nation, and the Southern United States region is no exception.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-5b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-5a.gif"></a><center><b>GM's Impact was previewed in several Southern markets during 1996 to set the stage for the EV1's launch in 1997.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



	<p>In the Southern region, GM's decision to go into production on the EV1 sedan and electric S-10 pickup have sharpened the focus on both critical technology development and market realities.  While the focus of much public attention is drawn to the racy EV1 which will initially be offered for sale only in California and Arizona, utilities and other electric transportation partners are already installing infrastructure for the eventual sale of EVs throughout the sunbelt.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Production Ramping Up In the Region</FONT></h3></p>


	<p>Although the EV1 will be produced in Michigan and initially be sold only in the Southwest, the electric pickup will be manufactured in Louisiana and be offered for sale to fleet customers throughout the nation. </p>
	<p>GM's moves have helped create a "race to market" atmosphere which is helping "pull" technologies developed through the DARPA program into commercial and military platforms.</p>
	<p>For example, Chrysler will be counting on AC induction drive trains developed in Maryland by Northrop Grumman (formerly Westinghouse Automotive Systems) and advanced lead-acid batteries from Texas-based Electrosource to power its 1997 model EPIC electric van.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-5d.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-5c.gif"></a><center><b>Pentastart's high performance hybrid-electric HMMWV featuring advanced lead-acid batteries from Electrosource and permanent magnet motors from Unique Mobility.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



  
	<p>Electrosource batteries are also at the heart of several military vehicle prototypes, including hybrid-electric HMMWVs being developed by Alabama-based Pentastar Electronics, a division of Chrysler, and a hybrid-electric M113 armored personnel carrier converted by United Defense.  When completed this summer, the HMMWV is expected to outperform conventional HMMWVs in several areas, including speed, maneuverability, stealth, and gradability.  Its permanent magnet motors from Unique Mobility will deliver twice the horsepower to the wheels than the conventional drive system, with three times the overall efficiency.</p>
	<p>Small, efficient permanent magnet motors developed by Fisher Technologies entered production to meet the need for more efficient climate control systems on Ford Ranger upfits by Troy Design & Manufacturing.  High efficiency alternators and traction motors also developed by Fisher under SCAT's DARPA program are being considered by other manufacturers for heavy duty vehicles, including buses.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>DARPA Program to Cut Bus Drive Train Costs </FONT></h3></p>


<p>	Electric bus shipments are picking up quickly with sales for 1996 looking to double or triple 1995's figures.  Northrup Grumman is in production in Puerto Rico with its 200KW AC drive train for Blue Bird school buses and transit-style buses, manufactured in Fort Valley, Georgia. General Electric has entered the shuttle bus drive train market with AC induction inverters and motors on buses built by Chattanooga's Advanced Vehicle Systems.</p>
<p>	Both Northrup Grumman and GE are participants in DARPA-funded programs to dramatically slash the price of their heavy-duty drive trains.  These programs focus on reducing parts count, integrated chip design, advanced motor controls, and smarter power electronics.  The GE system, being developed in conjunction with Analog Devices and IXYS, will produce open architecture components for the industry, including a new motor control chip, smart IGBT modules, and a new low-cost AC inverter package.  The goal is a minimum 50% reduction in price, with increased performance, over today's drive package</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>New Cooperative Thrusts Hasten Technology Development & Market Readiness</FONT></h3></p>


<p>	New SCAT research focus areas include battery management systems, larger battery packs for heavy duty vehicles, flywheel containment testing and a continuation of SCAT's pioneering work in pulse charging techniques.  The flywheel containment program involves development teams from every region of the nation, combined with several national labs, in an DARPA/DOE coordinated program of controlled destructive testing to develop affordable approaches to flywheel containment design.</p>
<p>	SCAT is also increasing its contributions to the DARPA modeling and simulation system, with new emphases on advanced batteries, pulse charging, and multiple drive trains.</p>
<p>	In response to requests by SCAT's 50 plus members, the organization is also expanding its program focus to include major thrusts in education and infrastructure development, including coordinated training programs for residential code officials, and a program of coordinated web page development with the other DARPA 
consortia.</p>
