CD-ROM PROVES TO BE MORE THAN A PLATTER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96

By Les Yetton

D-ROm technology is exploding. According to Dataquest, nearly 25
million drives were shipped in 1995.

This number is expected to expand to 50 million units by the end of
1998, and upwards of 70 million by the year 2000.

CD-ROM is now the most popular media used to distribute software.
Due to its capacity, (a standard CD-ROM disk can hold up to 650MB
of information, or the equivalent of 130 K pages of text),
durability, low production cost and ease of packaging and
distribution, virtually all new software titles are produced using
CD-ROM.

As more software applications are distributed and deployed on CD-
ROM, companies are beginning to look at ways to share this
information resource within corporate networks.

The adoption of the ISO-9660 CD-ROM format standard, supported by
nearly all of popular computing platforms allows CD-ROM data to be
read by users of DOS, Mac, Windows, Unix and OS/2 systems.

Why Network CD-ROMs

It is a relatively simple question of economics and sound business
practice. Organisations that make available a myriad of CD-ROM-
based information  empower their employees with instant access to
critical information, hence enabling them to make decisions
quicker.

With a shared CD-ROM resource on the network, organisations can
also provide better support and responsiveness to customers while
promoting better communication within the organisation.

Many large organisations use several types of computing platforms,
including PCs grouped together using NetWare, various Unix dialects
supporting TCP/IP, as well as several application servers running
Windows NT.

Today's CD-ROM Server solutions allow these environments to share
the same CD-ROM subsystem and information simultaneously.

There are several types of solutions available, from file server-
based software  to file server independent products that sit out on
an Ethernet or Token Ring as an intelligent node.

A networked CD-ROM subsystem incorporates three distinct
technologies: CD-ROM drive devices, network connectivity technology
and data storage management products.

CD-ROM Applications

The rate at which CD-ROM technology is assimilated into an
organisation is dependent upon those CD-ROM applications utilised
or about to be utilised.

Because of the appeal of the medium, the number of CD-ROMs being
made available to each professional, business and technical
discipline is growing exponentially. CD-ROM is becoming the
preferred publishing medium.

Although the first requirements in an organisation for CD-ROM
connectivity generally occur on the workgroup level, departmental
and enterprise level implementations can also quickly become
priorities.

Consequently, as the technology extends to the corporate void more
protocols and network operating systems need to be supported as
environments come on-line.

Networking CD-ROM drives offers significant benefits. There are
several different methods available to achieve basically the same
result. Some are hardware oriented, while others employ a software
approach. Some use existing file server resources while others are
file server independent.

What to Consider

Some factors to consider when choosing a CD-ROM networking
architecture:

  Cost

Hardware and software costs, license fees or per-user fees are
important.

  Ease of Installation

Solutions requiring access to file servers or a network shutdown
are often not desirable. Installation will ideally be plug-and-
play.

  Ease of operation

Ideally, users will have nothing new to learn.

  Multiprotocol Support

The product should be able to simultaneously support the major
protocols.

  Impact on File Server

Solutions that use file server resources can cause performance or
throughput problems, as file servers become burdened with the load
of handling additional overhead.

  Drive Location

In cases like major libraries, centralised drive location and
management is preferred. In other cases, it is desirable to have
the drives located departmentally.

  Performance and throughput

Performance should be sufficient to meet the current and
anticipated needs of the application.

To ensure that performance is consistent, it should be independent
of other activity on the network or file server.

  Doubling up on Network Traffic

Incremental network traffic should be minimised, particularly over
WANs or through LAN segments connected to bridges and routers.

Conclusion

There are various architectures to choose from to network CD-ROMs,
but one thing's for sure, CD-ROM networking is here to stay.

Why VLANs Are Now popular

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96

by Douglas Hill

Very few modern networking concepts are as confusing as virtual
LANs (VLANs). Virtual LANs are new, and their widespread use has
only just begun.

Vendors, in an attempt to take advantage of interest in the latest
trends, have blurred the concept of what a VLAN really is.

There are many ways to implement VLANs in switching products -
each with very different capabilities and limitations.

Why Use LAN Switches?

VLANs are an inherent outgrowth of LAN switching.

The amount of data being carried on LANs has grown steadily and
rapidly.

LAN switches make it possible to transfer much larger amounts of
data than was possible with hubs and routers. Token rings and
Ethernet segments can be dedicated to individual devices, or to
small groups of devices.

Limitations

LAN switches achieve high performance levels by using simplified
processes.

They are basically bridges, rather than routers. They switch via
layer-two ("MAC") destination/source addresses; this is much
simpler than routing.

All bridged networks have a basic limitation - bridges, since they
don't participate in the layer-three protocols which use MAC
broadcasts.

Although point-to-point traffic is isolated to the specific ports
sending and receiving those frames, broadcasts must be sent
everywhere.

The same is true of frames that have a destination MAC address that
hasn't been learned by the bridge. They have to be sent everywhere.

In most networks of moderate size, this "flooding" has almost no
impact on other traffic.

However, in a very large network or one with an unusually high
level of broadcasts, it is possible for flooding to impact point-
to-point traffic.

When this happens, it's important to keep broadcasts isolated in
"broadcast domains".

Many LANs built over the last 10 years use hubs and routers.

The workstations, servers, and other devices are connected to the
hubs, and the hubs are interconnected with routers.

In this type of LAN, broadcast domains are built automatically,
since every hub is a broadcast domain.

Routers are essentially devices for interconnecting broadcast
domains.

But with networks based on LAN switches we need to provide this
function in other ways.

Virtual LANs

A virtual LAN is a broadcast domain. Just as with a hub, all
devices in a virtual LAN see all broadcasts as well as all frames
with unknown destination addresses, so long as the broadcast and
"unknown" frames originated inside that virtual LAN.

With hubs and routers, frames are repeated within a hub and routed
between hubs. With virtual LANs, frames are switched (bridged)
within a virtual LAN, and routed between virtual LANs.

A virtual LAN can be considered as nothing more than a more
flexible version of familiar networking practices.

What is new is that a broadcast domain is no longer restricted to
the devices in one physical part of the network.

Switching is simpler than routing, and therefore faster.

To the extent that data can be switched between devices, rather
than routed, it can be moved faster.

Unfortunately for hub/router-based networks, devices that need to
connect to each other all day long are often in different parts of
a building, or even in different buildings.

Virtual LANs address this issue - if they're powerful enough.

A broadcast domain in a good virtual LAN implementation can span a
building, campus, or city.

So the need for routing is minimised, and data moves much faster.

Multiple MAC Types

Remember that the basic purpose of moving to a switched LAN is to
increase throughput.

One fundamental way to do that is to divide the network into
smaller segments or rings; this is done by switching each device on
its own segment or ring.

This means that workstations no longer contend for bandwidth.

Modern switched networks are moving to structures which allow
central resources to run at speeds greater than those of the
workstations.

Examples include: 10 Mbps Ethernet workstations and 100 Mbps
Ethernet servers; 16 Mbps token ring workstations and 100 Mbps FDDI
servers.

The point is to switch traffic between the workstation and the
servers, rather than routing it.

This means that a virtual LAN must be able to accommodate a variety
of MAC types.

Network Changes

In many networks it's common for devices to move frequently within
a building or a campus.

You should be able to assign a workstation to one or more virtual
LANs once, and after that it should remain connected to them, no
matter where on the campus it has moved.

Speed Operation

Increased throughput is the reason why LAN networks are moving to
switching solutions.

Virtual LANs assist this movement by keeping broadcast traffic at
reasonable levels.

It is obvious that the implementation of the virtual LAN capability
should not slow down the network.

This implies that the actual forwarding of the individual frames
should be done in hardware, including checking source and
destination virtual LAN matches.

BT FORESEES ASIAN TELCO DEREGULATION

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

UK-BASED telecommunications vendor, BT, will plug away in the Asia-
Pacific, despite the slow pace of deregulation in the region,
gaining entry through local partners and distributors.

"We are committed to deregulation, having made the transition from
a state-owned body to a private telco in 1984 and thence to one
with a global presence," said Mike Burgess, director, Marketing &
Sales, BT Asia-Pacific.

According to BT, the deregulation process had already begun in the
Asia-Pacific and it was only a matter of time before it opens up to
competition.

"Hong Kong and Singapore have started the process, so have
Indonesia and Malaysia," said Martin Benson, manager, Regional
Sales & Marketing, BT.

"The Communications Authority of Thailand has also been chartered
to start deregulation with the same developments being seen in the
Philippines.

Other challenges BT faces in the region are the varying technology
and infrastructure levels, geographical conditions and economic
growth rates.

"A rising trend here is the growing mobility and interdependence of
the business community," said Burgess. "This leads to a demand for
connectivity to the rest of the world anytime, anywhere."

BT's partners in the region are Marubeni (Japan), Wipro (India),
Dacom (Korea) and through its 20 per cent stake in MCI, Clear, a
New Zealand telecoms carrier .

EDS PICKS CHINA, INDIA AS NEXT TWO EXPANSION SITES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Raymond Tan

Electronic Data Systems (EDS), with regional operations
headquartered in Singapore, will expand further with the setting up
of two subsidiaries in China and India by Q1'97.

The China and India offices will add to the company's current sites
in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Thailand, said Nitin Gangla, managing director of EDS.

EDS grew 20 to 25 per cent over the last five years in the region,
with software and services revenues hitting US$12 million at the
end of 1995.

EDS markets and supports the JBA system/21 client server
applications that now run on different vendor platforms including
the IBM AS/400, RS/6000 and HP 9000 mid-range computers.

Gangla, citing SAP, SSA and JD Edwards as his main competitors,
expects growth to remain at 25 per cent for this year.

He is optimistic about the company's growth, counting EDS' long
experience and familiarity with the Asia-Pacific market as its main
strength.

"We have over 350 installed mid-range customers in the region -
with more than 100 for the AS/400 - of which 90 are based in
Singapore. SSA and JD Edwards have only been here for five years."

Gangla said EDS was set up in Singapore in 1979 as a software
house. It has since moved into providing software applications for
IBM computers and into IT services such as outsourcing, help desks,
disaster recovery and network management.

Chief among Gangla's concerns is to steer the industry away from
the perception that EDS is only an IBM solutions company.

He said although more than half of EDS' revenue came from
supporting the AS/400 and RS/6000 platforms, revenue from services
and multivendor platforms will overtake the IBM-based revenue by
the end of the year.

"The market has shifted, wanting more value-added services. We've
evolved the company to do more consulting and services," he said.

Gangla said outsourcing has offered EDS good potential, with the
company already signing up 15 customers in the region.

"In the US small to mid-range systems market, 40 to 50 per cent of
companies have already outsourced their IT operations. In Asia,
this figure is below one per cent. There is a big market out here."

600 resolution displays.

Chips and Technologies' HiQVideo PCI graphics controller allows
playback of 64 K colour high-resolution, full motion, full screen
video.

Performance is assisted with 64-bit BitBLT graphics acceleration
and 2 MB of EDO video memory.

The notebook also features the new Zoom Video (ZV) Port technology
which allows for advanced multimedia applications such as hardware
MPEG-1, future MPEG-2, future video teleconferencing, video
capture, and on screen television through industry-standard PC
Cards

The notebook comes standard with a 6X CD-ROM drive, which can be
inserted into its Selectable Bay (modular options slot), which can
also house the floppy disk drive module.

Both modules come standard and can be used simultaneously - either
by connecting the floppy disk drive externally or through the
optional Desk Station V Plus docking station.

Toshiba also has an optional Desk Station V Plus or Enhanced Port
Replicator II to provide the Tecra with expansion capabilities.

RIGHT STUFF FOR WEB AUTHORS: COREL WEB. DESIGNER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Using Web.Designer's browser to view my own home page, I quickly
realised the effectiveness of the software: an error log appeared
showing all my invalid HTML markups.

Very handy, but it would not print out, nor could I relocate the
file so it meant reloading the page again and taking notes.

Though many templates are available in Web.Designer, I decided to
try my hand at the WYSIWYG Web designer.

I fairly quickly assembled a new Web page.

Wanting to hyperlink a word it was quickly determined that a word
has to be highlighted before the button on the button-bar activates
so it can be clicked. The Help function came in handy to find that
bit of information.

However, the manual supplied has little information, its pages
mostly containing the pictures of Web Gallery.

I tried Web.Transit without giving it too much of my time to see
how fast I could at least get a handle on the program.

Transit converts documents into HTML format. It proved that getting
familiar with Web.Transit would not be a short process, simply
because when you import a file to be formatted for HTML viewing
there are a lot of decisions to be made prior to that step.

The file itself has to be in shape, whether in Rich Text Format,
Word, WordPerfect or ASCII.

Then a template equivalent has to be ready, with tags, then the
paths have to be right.

When everything is ready, pushing the right buttons shows coloured
fillers rapidly giving an effective indication of the job going
through and the layout is done in a jiffy - a jiffy excluding all
the work that has gone into setting everything up.

Thumbs up to Corel with their submission to the arena of Web page
and HTML document design.

Corel Gallery is also supplied with Designer and Transit. It runs
on Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and NT, and supports Java applets.

FASTER ACCESS TO WEB INFORMATION

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Tony Henderson

More Like This, the Web search software from KDL technology, has
some attractive features.

The idea is to provide a search method using far less steps than is
usual when using Alta Vista, Lycos or whatever.

While CyberSearch and Web Compass do offline searches, search
engines such as Alta Vista, which have been more than just handy
helpers for many users, are feeling the strain.

What is needed today is a smarter search that achieves higher
efficiency. That is the promise that comes with More Like This.

This is accomplished using its own information base as a kind of
treasury that facilitates searches through words associated with
key words.

However, the programme itself is not yet perfect: it did not filter
out repeated displays of Web pages following a search.

The problem may lie in how creators of Web pages write their search
help details.

On the other hand, these Web search engines which perform site
indexing just plod their way through the Internet and if they
blindly log on to everything found, repetitions will occur.

So the fault may well lie on the other side - KDL Technology in
this case.

To make a fair comparison, I tested the on-line Excite search using
Netscape, and it was clear that using Excite resulted in less
repetitions.

In fact, having Excite to tap into without the need to have the
search software located on one's own hard disk means a fair saving
in disk space and the associated woes of installing it.

Check out Excite at http://www.excite.com before digging into your
pockets for any installable software.

Search Levels

There are four levels of search with More Like This: standard,
keyword, concept and wide angle.

Standard is a straightforward search, of course using its inbred
intelligence.

Keyword is a more focused search where use is made of selected
words.

Concept casts a broader net and promises to be quite entertaining,
while  wide angle brings in materials normally left outside typical
searches.

If strict control is required over the search, there is a custom
search feature which lets the user determine how searches are
conducted.

This helper application, which sits nicely atop the browser, can
work with Usenet articles as well as Web pages.

KDL says this is not a plug-in, which they define as a program
which may alter the program a plug-in works with.

More Like This can be minimised and placed on the taskbar like any
other Windows 95 adapted program.

It runs on Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, requiring 7 MB of free disk
space to install and works best with 8 MB or more of RAM.

CREATIVE CONTROL FOR CARD HAPPY USERS: Corel Print House

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Dwayne Serjeant

Flying out of the Corel stable and into the category of "1,001
useless applications to fill up your hard disk" comes Print House,
your personal calendar and card maker.

I know that, being a designer, perhaps I shouldn't tilt my nose so
high at products like this because there is a market for them.

It reminds me of 10 years ago, when you had a product like
PrintShop for the Apple II that enabled you to print the same sort
of things on a dinky little dot-matrix printer.

Although slightly more sophisticated in what it can produce, Print
House is the basically the same application with a Beverly Hills
facelift.

The manual is a good couple of hundred pages long, but only the
first 16 are taken up with how to use the application. The
remainder are pictures of the clip-art libraries included on the
CD-ROM.

Installation

Installation is simple enough with the Corel/Microsoft Wizard
technology taking you through the steps.

Also included, and definitely worth using, is the Uninstall Wizard
which, like most Uninstall options, gets rid of the myriad
collection of files that are installed nowadays.

Print House can be used by multiple users by way of a customised
startup.

By setting up the manner in which users want their application to
be presented, Print House makes it easier on the novice to get up
and running, although it would be hard to place a 'professional'
option into this application.

You can begin Print House with a variety of options including
starting from an existing sample, starting totally from scratch,
using a saved version/template that you have created, or by using a
PaperDirect template.

PaperDirect make high quality paper reams and objects which Print
House users can print directly to.

The trouble here is that it's an IDD call to get your set of papers
ordered, and a DHL option for delivery. Isn't Hallmark still
cheaper?

Ease Of Use

The toolbar palette includes just enough options to let you tweak
and adjust the included graphics, or to draw your own.

It all borrows fairly heavily from Corel's CorelDraw product and
even feels fairly similar, but is far easier to get to grips with.

The standard options for type adjustment and colour changing are in
place and the interface is similar to all the Corel line of
products.

An additional notebook option lets absolute beginners get to grips
with Print House by popping up buttons with labels like 'Edit
Project', 'Save Project' and 'Exit Print House'.

It really would be difficult to get lost with this product and I'm
sure that was its main purpose.

Messages

Aside from the conventional collection of clip-art, Print House
includes a large selection of desktop printer-quality photographs
and an even larger collection of canned messages like "Wishing You
A Wonderful Day" and "For A Nice Grandma. Did You Know That
Wherever You Go, Happiness Follows."

If the youngster of the house wants a card making application, then
the glove fits.

AZTECH ZETA MASTERS ART OF SPEED READING: Aztech Zeta 10X CD-ROM Drive (CDA
1068)

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Alan Andrews

In increasing number of software developers today opt in favour of
the CD-ROM drive as the preferred storage media.

CD-ROM drive manufactures are also churning out ever faster CD-ROM
drives.

We evaluated one such offering from Aztech Systems: the Aztech Zeta
10X CD-ROM drive (Model CDA-1068).

The X-factor

In its nomenclature, the X signifies its basic data transfer speed
of 150 kbps, hence 10X signifies 1500 kbps.

Fast CD-ROM drives like the Zeta do fill a need: a sluggish CD-ROM
drive can take ages to retrieve information from a CD-ROM.

Faster CD-ROM drives speed up the transfer of information from the
CD- ROM to the computer system.

This results in good quality reproduction of animated files from a
CD-ROM disk.

Test Drive

We decided to evaluate the Aztech Zeta drive considering the
reality of today's requirements instead of merely testing whether
it conformed to specifications.

To ensure compatibility on different machines, we tested the Zeta
drive on an assembled 486 as well as on a branded Pentium machine.

Both machines were loaded with 8 MB RAM and an IDE drive interface.

What immediately strikes the lay user about the Zeta drive are its
ease of installation and use.

It took us barely 15 minutes to connect the drive and kick start
the Windows 95 machine.

Windows 95 has built in drivers that recognise the drive.

Speeding Ticket

Next we tested it for speed.

Having loaded the Microsoft Encarta 95 CD-ROM encyclopedia disk, a
search for the specific words brought up the results in the
twinkling of an eye.

The Zeta drive is also capable of playing normal Audio CDs.

Its front panel has an easily accessible volume control, a
stop/eject button and a play/skip button.

The drive also has the capability to run multimedia games, minus
the jerky motion.

We tested the drive with WarCraft, Rebel Assault, Power Monger and
Flight Simulator.

While running most games, a CD-ROM drive has to look into the CD-
ROM for code or pictures.

When the CD-ROM drive is slow in its search, it takes time to
locate the information, causing a temporary break in the game or
introducing a jerky motion of the animated object.

With the Zeta CDA 1068 we did not experience any of these hitches.
The drive is excellent retrieving data:  it took just 12 seconds to
read 52 MB of data from the data CD.

Support

While the performance of the drive was good, the documentation on
the drive is just a skimpy leaflet.

It does not reveal much. For instance, it did not mention what the
purpose of a red jumper on the CD-ROM drive is.

The Customer Support Number in the warranty certificate led us to
chase up three other numbers.

Though the leaflet mentions that the Customer Support Number is 65-
741-7211, the actual number we had to call was 65-742-9633.

This number is not listed in the Certificate of Warranty literature
provided by Aztech.

However the people providing help on 65-742-9633 are extremely
patient, competent and helpful.

Aztech's Web site,  www.aztech.com.sg, was a good source of
information for Aztech products, FAQs as well as utilities and
drivers.

Evaluation

Overall the Aztech CDA 1,068 10X drive does answer the requirements
of today's impatient, speed-hungry users.

It does its job quickly, efficiently and with a minimum of fuss,
which is what the lay user wants.

DBMS REVAMP HELPS INFORMIX PIP SYBASE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

IN A recent report on the DBMS market, US-based market research
firm, the Gartner Group, reported that it observed a shift in the
database ranks in 1995 with Sybase and Informix swapping positions.

Sybase, said the report, reacted to significant technical and
quality challenges with the delivery of System 11 but the damage
had already been done with System 10 and it fell to No. 3 in DBMS
revenues.

Informix, on the other hand, addressed the challenges of
scalability when it undertook a complete DBMS redesign in 1990.

The company also turned a corner in 1995 with a shift in focus to
supporting high-end OLTP and DSS solutions.

The Illustra acquisition also positions Informix strongly to
support the new application demands beyond the year 2000.

In the Asia-Pacific, IDC figures tallied with the Gartner Group's
findings, placing Informix third behind Oracle and IBM but ahead of
Sybase.

WILL INFORMIX BE LATE?

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

INFORMIX first announced Universal Server back in February 1996
after it had finalised its acquisition of Illustra. According to
the company, Universal Server will integrate Illustra's dynamic
content management system into its Dynamic Scalable Architecture.

When finally delivered in the fourth quarter of 1996, Universal
Server will be able to manage all information assets including
numbers, images, maps, sound, video, Web pages and text.

Some industry analysts doubted, however, that Informix would be
able to meet the deadline.

"It takes a year just to debug an application, let alone merge a
one million-line RDBMS with a 500,000-line server," said Rick
Finkelstein, president, Performance Computing. "It will never
really happen."

The Aberdeen Group, on the other hand, felt that despite the
technical details, Informix's target was achievable. "Informix's
parallel-scalable architecture combined with extensible DataBlade
modules will put Informix well-ahead of its competitors," said a
recent Aberdeen report on Universal Server technology.

INFORMIX WILL KEEP FOCUS ON DATABASE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by William Oei

WO: INFORMIX's financial results for Q2'96 defied earlier downcast
projections with 38 per cent revenue growth over the corresponding
period last year. Why was this so?

WT: One of the reasons was the strong 51 per cent growth that we
experienced in the Asia-Pacific. Some countries in Southeast Asia
eclipsed even this with 80 per cent growth rates.

The economies here are growing fast with a lot of data to
manipulate. Companies here need the kind of database power that we
can offer.

Worldwide, we saw our database licenses grow by 61 per cent over
1995 and our new product releases and announcements such as
Informix Workgroup Server for Unix and Windows NT and Informix
OnLine Extended Parallel Server 8.1 and Universal Server were well
received.

What differentiates Informix from the other database vendors such
as Oracle and Sybase?

First and foremost, unlike our competitors, we focus on nothing
else but on database and database tools and are thus able to
channel all our resources toward this end.

Some 70 per cent of our revenues come from our database business.

We recognise that we cannot be the best in everything and thus work
with a wide range of partners from system vendors like Digital
Equipment, application vendors such as Baan, SAP, SSA and
Peoplesoft, consultants like the Big Six, and systems integrators
like NCS, ST Computers and CSA.

In this way, we can leverage off the core strengths of each party
other.

We are also very focused on a few industries to prevent ourselves
from being spread too thin.

These areas include the telco, manufacturing, banking and finance
and particularly in Asia, the government industries.

Some analysts say that difficulties in integrating the Informix and
Illustra databases will delay Universal Server. Is this true?

Absolutely not. Although it won't be easy task to integrate the
object-oriented database from Illustra with our relational-based
one, we are confident of meeting our year-end ship date.

In September, we will launch the Datablade Developers Program and
already have at least 24 companies including the likes of Adobe
Systems, Macromedia, MapInfo and Verity, writing datablades for a
whole host of applications such as text search/management, video
search and retrieval and electronic commerce.

Industry analysts reported in February, after we officially
acquired Illustra, that we had an 18 month headstart on our
competition in multi-dimensional, object-oriented relational
database technology.

What are Informix's expansion plans in the Asia-Pacific?

You will see us putting in more offices, more people, more hardware
resources such as the Advanced Training Centre (see page 2 News) we
recently set up with Digital, more training centres, and tighter
relations with our ISVs and channel partners.

We are also looking at adding to the four offices we already have
in China, and to the three in India. Korea is another possibility
for increased presence.

In Southeast Asia, we currently have offices in Philippines,
Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and will establish one in Indonesia
within the next six months.

BATTLE WILL CENTRE ON INTRANET FRONT

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Yap Cheng Theng

NETSCAPE has made it clear it is not in the browser war with
Microsoft but in the intranet war as it unveils its strategy in the
corporate world and in the Asia-Pacific.

Speaking to reporters after launching Navigator 3.0 in Hong Kong
recently, Quentin Gallivan, VP, Asia-Pacific Sales, Netscape
Communications, said the company intends to compete with Microsoft
in three ways: support cross-platform environment; support open
standards and provide intranet solutions at a better
price/performance level and lower cost of ownership.

"Microsoft Internet/intranet products support only the Windows
environment, only 38 per cent of the entire marketplace. Our
products cover 100 per cent of the marketplace as we provide
multiplatform support including Windows, OS/2, Mac and Unix," said
Gallivan.

Corporate Sales

Stressing that 80 per cent of Netscape's current sales come from
corporations, Gallivan said Netscape's initiatives in this market
include Navigator; Netscape One, the developers programme targeted
at both developers and independent software developers; Navio, a
new division that will look into using Navigator on gaming and
paging devices as well as interactive TV sets; and Actra, a
solution for electronic commerce.

On the server side, Gallivan said the enterprise server, mail
server and news server are now available with certificate server
and directory server  available by the end of the year.

Netscape recorded US$75 million in revenues for Q2 ended June '96.

Citing analyst projections, he said by end 1996, the company may
well hit the US$300 million range.

In Asia, Netscape's strategy is two-fold. The first is to develop
local partnerships in every country and secondly, to set-up Asia-
Pacific offices to provide in-depth technical and product support
as well as marketing functions.

"We want to get the Asia-Pacific faster into Netscape's product
lifecycle," said Gallivan, which is why the company recently opened
an office in Hong Kong, he added.

Following this, there will be an office in Malaysia and Korea
within the next six months.

Netscape will also deploy mirror Web sites in the region which will
have more localised content and more accessible information.

A mirrored Web site is operational  in Australia, being built up in
Japan and will be set up in Hong Kong and Singapore towards the end
of this year.

Netscape has appointed Hong Kong's JOS Distribution as its master
distributor in January this year. Sales have been growing 30 to 40
per cent month-on-month, said Albert Chan, GM, JOS Distribution.

NETSCAPE UNWRAPS CROSS PLATFORM OS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Tim Bajarin

If you had ever wondered about Netscape's intentions of turning
their popular browser into a cross platform operating system, you
can wonder no more.

Netscape recently announced the Netscape AppFoundry, which is a new
application model for developing enterprisewide applications.

Eighty per cent of Netscape's revenues come from the use of their
browsers and network software in enterprise systems.

Their goal is to gain 30 to 50 per cent market share in corporate
environments where client-server architecture is becoming standard
even for mission critical operations.

Cross Platform Technology

They see their main competition coming from Lotus Notes and
Microsoft's Back Office, but Netscape is bullish about their
projected goals since they believe that they have an edge due to
their true cross platform technology.

At the heart of the AppFoundry is a set of tools that would let
users build applications based on a common intranet infrastructure.

Netscape claims that with these tools a user could develop and
deploy a fully distributed knowledge repository that is built once
and can run anywhere.

More importantly, it could work with legacy systems databases,
platforms and even applications.

This is the original vision of all of the software gurus who have
been touting object-based back-end software for over a decade.

Cross Platform

However, the Internet, and more particularly, intranets, make it
possible for a true cross platform object software model to emerge
and Netscape plans to be in the forefront of this development.

The AppFoundry could be pivotal in this scenario as it would create
the back-end network and applications layer that would work on any
existing desktop PC, as well as thin clients.

At the core of AppFoundry is something call ed Netscape SuiteSpot,
where network productivity applications, such as publishing,
collaboration, messaging, search and indexing and directory and
security reside.

A user would utilise this SuiteSpot to link these applications to
company-specific applications such as R&D, human resources, sales
and distribution, finance, customer service and marketing.

Over the next nine months, Netscape will create and develop the
tools to deliver on this concept, starting with Netscape SuiteSpot
software, a full service intranet suite, followed by the Netscape
One and Development tools.

By Q1 of 1997, they will start delivering the AppFoundry
applications and tool kit, which will then give users a set of
enterprisewide solutions.

This new venture is interesting since it uses Java and JavaScript
source code, which will be given free and is downloadable,
modifiable and viewable from the 'Net.

With their AppFoundry program, Netscape is clearly on a path to
take Microsoft head on and push to have their Netscape browser
become the GUI not only for the 'Net but for all applications in
the future.

With the AppFoundry, they now have a set of development tools that
is truly cross platform and one that should make them a formidable
competitor.

HK OEM FIRM turns to innovation

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Mby Joy Tang

Manufacturing VGA cards for OEM and ODM customers is no longer
enough for Hong Kong company Express Office Automation.

Six years after acting as an OEM/ODM VGA card shop, the company has
decided to offer a value-added series of VGA cards for the retail
market under its Elephant brand name (see photo at right).

According to Andson Lam, MD, Express Office Automation, the firm
currently supplies more than 50 per cent of the world's VGA cards.

However, lack of product differentiation has forced local companies
to compete largely on price, quantity, or by cutting material
costs.

The convergence of PC, video and TV technologies were behind Lam's
decision on VGA cards as his first retail product family.

"Since MPEG software technology today has already advanced to
supporting 28 to 50 fps, we believe that it's also time for VGA
cards and MPEG software to replace the hardware MPEG card in
providing smooth video CD entertainment on the PC and television,"
he said.

Lam added that users prefer to record computer images onto video
rather than storing them onto the hard disk. "To do so, they need a
VGA-to-TV converter," he said.

In addition, edutainment applications are best viewed on a large
screen TV than on the standard 14-inch PC monitor, he said.

"It is the first time we have something for retail," Lam said. "If
we produced a conventional VGA card, it would be the same as any
other. I could not have added a brand name."

After six months of R&D by a six-man engineering team, Express
Office Automation came up with the Elephant Power Video series of
VGA cards which currently has 12 models based on chipsets from
Alliance, Trident, S3, and Cirrus Logic.

Unique Features

The distinguishing feature of the cards is the optional US$40 EV-
TO-03 PC-to-TV signal converter module daughtercard, which fits
onto a custom-designed, 20-pin connector built onto each card.

The value-addition comes from optimising VGA output for TV
resolutions.

Robert Chan, Express Office Automation's engineering manager, said
that the latest US chipset and digital-to-analogue circuit
technology had been employed to achieve near-PC monitor quality on
the television display.

"The EV-TO-03 is designed with an anti-flicker and phase-locked
loop circuit to provide the best performance of VGA-to-TV
conversion," he said.

"Users can connect their PCs to a standard TV through an external
S-Video or composite TV connector, and adjust the horizontal and
vertical screen position externally."

Interest in the product has been promising, with over 4,000 cards
sold in two months of promotion.

Bundling agreements have already been forged with PC companies Ta
Chi Computer in Beijing and East Ocean Computer in Shanghai, while
other partnerships are under discussion in the US, Germany, Korea
and Israel.

Lam projects sales of 5,000 to 10,000 VGA cards a month.

About 3,500 VGA cards and 2,000 daughtercards a day are being
produced at the company's Shenzhen factory, and production volume
is expected to reach a million units annually.

The company  is also working on a project to design a motherboard
for an Internet appliance. Lam said that the motherboard will
integrate VGA, TV output, I/O, audio and modem functions in a
notebook-sized form factor.

ASIAN FIRMS TRYING TQM FOR QUALITY

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

As Asia's economies continue to boom, many companies are now facing
quality management issues which will determine their future success
in the global business arena.

Convincing employees to take responsibility for their production
lines and make their own decisions may be the toughest obstacle
companies in Asia will need to overcome.

Positive results can be achieved through departmental initiatives
that fulfil local objectives, provided there is support from senior
management to implement Total Quality Management (TQM) programmes.

A new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), The Quest
for Quality: Mastering Management in Asia examines TQM, focusing
primarily on quality in the Asian context.

The report bases its conclusions on a survey of several hundred UK
and Hong Kong firms, examining how companies in Asia have adopted
TQM and what benefits and pitfalls they have experienced.

To evaluate different approaches to quality, the report compares
TQM and Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and concludes that
BPR can be seen as the successor to TQM.

Pros And Cons

While TQM involves systematic performance measures, benchmarking,
empowerment and continuous development, BPR deals with the process
of "deconstructing" a company to better meet customer needs.

BPR examines a company's entire future structure and then attempts
to reorganise things according to senior executives' ideals.

However, companies cannot achieve dramatic restructuring without
the right human resources co-operation and management expertise.

On the other hand, TQM tends to deal with corporate and local
culture first.

A TQM process may involve a certain amount of restructuring - most
commonly, a move towards cross-functional work structures.

BPR and TQM can be integrated successfully through a dual-track
approach designed to incorporate the TQM process with the corporate
planning process.

Having defined its mission for quality, management must then
determine what is critical to achieving successful results.

A full review of the company's strengths and weaknesses in relation
to these critical success factors should reveal important areas
where improvements can be made.

Asian Responses

According to the report, Asian junior and middle managers are wary
of TQM, but senior managers tend to view it as the only authentic
revolution in management practice in the last 40 years.

The report offers guidelines on the different approaches to
implementation of TQM and provides various measures on how to
measure results.

The tendency to run companies in a traditionally patriarchal way is
widespread in Asia, with the CEO seen as a father figure
responsible for all management decisions.

The report warns that ISO 9000, traditionally regarded as the
internationally recognised standard of quality, should not be
confused with ongoing TQM programmes.

While it may increase competitiveness and satisfy clients, it is
unlikely to foster a culture of continuous improvement.

Most companies which implement successful TQM programmes see
certification in ISO 9000, at best, as one of a number of important
milestones on the way to a broader and more long-term goal.

A case study in the report looks at the success of a TQM system
established in the 1980s by Hong Kong's Kowloon-Canton Railway
Corporation (KCRC).

Benefits have included significantly raised profits and increased
customer and employee satisfaction.

Since 1990, operating costs have dropped by 19 per cent and the
KCRC has re-invested 11 per cent of the profit into the company,
passing on the remaining 8 per cent to the passengers through fare
reductions.

A case study on Texas Instruments in the Philippines reveals the
company's move away from a hierarchical structure with dogmatic
leadership focused on making products, towards a "flatter" network
structure with an inspirational leadership seeking to create new
markets.

The report concludes that an analysis of successful companies shows
that they have common characteristics: strong leadership and clear
vision; an empowered workforce; effective use of information
technology and teamwork; and careful management of resources to let
the company do "less with more".

The report shows that successful TQM strategies can be implemented
and results achieved in Asia, despite the indigenous cultures and
work philosophies common throughout the region.

It also shows that TQM can benefit all tiers of a company and, if
implemented correctly, result in higher production capacity, higher
bottom-line profits and job satisfaction among employees and,
ultimately, end-users.

IBM CHANGES TACK TO GAIN REVENUES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Isabelle Chan

IBM, the world's No. 1 computer company, raked in revenues of US$70
billion last year. The years prior to that saw Big Blue's financial
performance stagnating in the US$60 - US$65 billion revenue
bracket.

Although the revenue figures are probably the envy of many small as
well as large companies, IBM felt it was not growing.

"We realised we couldn't really grow, and it was critical for us to
grow," said Andrew Shields, director of Sales and Channels, Asia-
Pacific, IBM Software, speaking to ACW recently.

Eighteen months ago, IBM was restructured and the IBM Software
Company headed by John Thompson, was born.

"We see software as the lynchpin between IBM hardware and services.
If we succeed in software, we can sell more services and hardware,"
said Shields.

The IBM Software Company can be said to be facing the same problem
as corporate IBM.

Despite revenues of US$12.7 billion in FY'95, making it the largest
software company in the world, Shields said its software business
was not growing. "Software was a profitable business for us, but it
was not growing the way we wanted," he said.

One-third of the total software business was found in large systems
or mainframe, which was not growing, Shields said.

"The growth was in desktop or distributed systems software.
Although we are seen as a major player, we need to become No. 1 in
order to compete with companies like Microsoft and Novell," said
Shield.

"We realised that if we continued with what we were doing, we could
not become No.1 as the competition had too much of a headstart."

Therefore, Shields siad the strategic direction for the software
group was to shrug off its proprietary history and be "open".

New Strategies

To do that, IBM embarked on technology acquisitions of companies in
collaborative/workgroup computing and supporting multiple
platforms.

In addition, it began to develop internal products that also worked
in a heterogeneous environment.

The Lotus and Tivoli acquisitions not only offered products that
fitted into IBM's network-centric computing focus, but also
provided access to markets that Big Blue did not have.

The story does not end here. IBM still had a number of issues to
address.

Firstly, because its focus was solely on direct selling, it lacked
resources to cover the whole market.

"We didn't have enough people to cover the market, and our
competitors were gaining market share. So we decided to focus on
our business partners and formed the BESTeam programme," said
Shields.

"Particularly in the last two years, we realised the value of
external business partners in growing IBM. The challenge is to
build both internal and external channels and to work in harmony."

According to Shields, the new programme essentially helps its
BESTeam members to increase revenue, reduce costs and enhance the
company's image. IBM currently offers BESTeam members free
technical and product training till the end of the year.

The Business Enterprise Solution Team (BESTeam) programme has some
700 members, and the number is expected to hit 1,000 by year-end.
The initial target was 250 for 1996.

Ninety per cent of IBM's Asia-Pacific software revenues last year
were generated through direct selling. Shields is aiming for 80 per
cent of desktop software in the Asia-Pacific to be sold through its
external channels.

"So far, we're pleased with the results, and we are set to achieve
our target. At the end of July this year, 75 per cent has been sold
through our business partners," he said.

Comparing with IBM's Asia-Pacific software revenues of US$2 billion
last year, Shields said he expects a better performance this year
with a target of US$2.3 billion, half of which will be from desktop
revenues.

Although IBM will continue to be strong in its traditionally big
markets Japan and Australia, its key focus will be on the growth
markets in Asean and Greater China.

Market-oriented Approach

Shields also said that IBM needs to move from a sales-oriented
approach to become more of a marketing-oriented company in order to
be successful.

"We found that IBM is the largest software company in the world
which most people didn't realise,  including ourselves. We need to
communicate it and tell our customers what we are doing," he said.

When asked if the negative image of OS/2 has had any impact on the
rest of IBM's software products, Shields said: "There's a negative
image of OS/2, and we've been reacting to the negative press. But
we have to stop it, and we don't have to apologise for it. OS/2 has
done well in the market it was targeted at, which is the corporate
market.

"We have new products, but OS/2 is just a small piece of the pie.
IBM's focus is on open systems software and we're focusing heavily
on middleware," he added.

It appears IBM is turning around with a completely new strategy.
But is the IBMer ready for this new open approach?

"We are our own biggest enemy in terms of understanding what we
are. But the IBM culture is very strong. Many IBM staff have been
in the company for many years, since the days when we "ran" the
industry," said Shields.

"Now that we are employing people from outside, the negative
aspects of the IBM culture will break down, and people will become
more open minded."

HOME IMAGING HOLDS EXCITING POSSIBILITIES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

THE day is not far off when consumers will be able to take a
photograph, manipulate the image and print it on a printer at home.
This is Hewlett-Packard's vision for the future.

Its Home Imaging Division, formed about 18 months ago, focuses on
the development of this new concept, said Vjomesh Joshi, general
manager, Home Imaging Division, HP.

According to Joshi, 60 million photos are taken each year, and over
29 per cent of PC owners would like to manipulate photos on their
computer.

HP has earmarked 1997 as the year when its vision to bring
photography to the home PC will become reality. According to Joshi,
the division will introduce a home imaging system next year.

Joshi believes market opportunities exist as the number of
multimedia home PCs is expected to grow from 40 million this year
to 120 million by the year 2000.

The key success factors for the technology to become mainstream are
many. Joshi believes the technology has to reach a price point that
is affordable to consumers, have high photographic quality, be easy
to use, and be integrated with on-line services.

SECURITY, COMMUNICATIONS VENDORS GET ACT TOGETHER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by John Stephens

Traditionally data communications and security have been two
completely separate disciplines.

Companies that produced state-of-the-art communications products
did not dabble in cryptography, while security specialists were not
prepared to invest in the highly competitive world of data
communications.

This led to the emergence of conflicting standards and requirements
for communication and security.

Does a mass market for secure communications  exist? And if it
does, who are the users?

A few years ago the answer to this question would have been in the
negative.

The few existing users were restricted to the financial and
government market sectors.

However technology has opened up new opportunities for
communications which did not exist a few years ago.

New business practices such as telecommuting, cybershopping and
'Net-based financial services are driving the requirements for low
cost, convenient and effective secure communications.

Security will become an integral part of data communications in the
future. The day will come when users will purchase communications
products with built-in security without being aware of its
presence.

Security Features

Building security into communications products should not mean that
security will be degraded.

To illustrate, we can use as an example the integration of security
features into the analogue dial-up modem. I use the modem as an
example only because it will be the most commonly used
communications device for the foreseeable future.

However similar arguments could be applied to leased line modems or
digital ISDN products.

There are some modem manufacturers who claim to offer a high degree
of security because they encrypt the data which passes through
their devices.

The provision of encryption does not in itself guarantee security.

The type of algorithm used to do the encryption is a critical
feature that a user should look for.

The average user is not qualified to determine the strength or
weakness of a manufacturer's proprietary algorithm.

To consider an example, it would be possible for a manufacturer to
build a buffer in a modem that stored 100 bits of data.

The contents of the buffer when full, would be read out in the
reverse order.

The effect of this would be blocks of 100 bits of data whose order
is reversed. While the data on the telephone line would appear
unreadable, it would be a trivial exercise to reconstruct the
original message.

This is a rather simple example but it demonstrates that the
average user has no chance of assessing the strength of the
security in a product.

The solution is to go for products that make use of security
techniques which are in the public domain and have been
independently assessed by experts in the field of cryptography.

The use of public domain algorithms creates further problems.

If the details of an algorithm are known, then the security of the
data passing through the algorithm depends on security given to the
cryptographic keys  that are used.

Secure Key Management

There are products on the market which use the DES algorithm that
meets the criteria of being an independently verified algorithm,
and uses a single fixed key for the encryption of data.

Because these types of products generally have no means of changing
the cryptographic keys, the user is left with a product which is
useless.

Users should look for products which offer a secure key management
facility.

One such technique for secure key management is  the Diffie Hellman
key exchange.

The technique makes use of public key algorithms to securely
establish encryption keys between communicating modems.

Forward looking manufacturers of communications products are
looking to security vendors for help in combining communications
and security.

It will not be long before we will see fully secure LAN, ISDN and
X.25 interface products.

We will also start to see security being incorporated into the
communications standards.

HARDCOPY BUSINESS SET TO LEAP IN ASIA

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Hewlett-Packard is looking to grow its hardcopy business with major
investments by its Business LaserJet Division and Inkjet Printer
Group in the fast-growing Asian markets.

According to Chris Morgan, marketing centre manager, Peripherals
Group, Asia-Pacific, HP, the company's hardcopy business grew about
45.4 per cent, almost doubling the overall market growth of 22.8
per cent.

The highest growing countries, which grew more than 100 per cent,
are New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia, said Morgan.

According to Rich Raimondi, general manager, Business LaserJet
Division, Hewlett-Packard, the division is now looking to grow the
market, and is making major investments in Singapore and China.

In a bid to be more consumer-oriented, HP has introduced a change
in its manufacturing process, according to Pradeep Jotwani, general
manager, Consumer Sales & Marketing, Hewlett-Packard.

Its long term strategies were to move closer to the customer
through regional diversification; to increase contract
manufacturing for flexibility; and to improve and integrate the
information systems and delivery mechanisms.

HP ADDS EXCITEMENT TO PERIPHERAL MARKET

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Isabelle Chan from San Francisco, USA

The action in the printer and scanner markets today may seem dull
when compared to the exciting advancements in the PC or networking
arena.

But the Internet and future applications are set to make printer
and scanner markets more compelling technologies and more
interesting to watch.

According to senior executives at the recent Hewlett-Packard Asia-
Pacific Technologies Symposium in San Francisco, USA, peripherals
like the printer and scanner are set to become mainstream products,
with the Internet and new applications for the growing home market
being a driving force.

"Information created between 1995 and the year 2000 will be equal
in quantity to all information that previously existed," said Rich
Raimondi, general manager, Business LaserJet Division, Hewlett-
Packard.

"The Internet is, therefore, driving a new set of information needs
and requires a more efficient work-flow model."

HP's Digital Workplace strategy will streamline office processes by
integrating printing, scanning and the Internet in a new model of
information distribution.

According to HP, the increased use of networks and network printing
has accelerated a move from copying to 'mopying', a term that
describes the process of creating multiple original prints or
mopies on a laser printer.

Raimondi said the fundamental premise of mopying is to take pages
away from copier machines.

Over the past few years, lasers have become faster, cheaper and
more reliable.

The developments have resulted in a trend towards printing mopies
rather than multiple copies of an original.

Quoting Dataquest's research findings, Raimondi said 40 per cent of
users are already "mopying" on their laser printers.

Leveraging its experience in PC, printer and networking, HP is
scheduled to roll-out a mopier by year-end, said Raimondi.

HP's Inkjet Products Group is also broadening its product focus to
develop devices tweaked for specific applications such as large
format and photographic printing, instead of today's versatile-type
devices that handle a variety of printing needs.

On the scanner front, this peripheral has extended its role beyond
being a tool for graphic designers, and has carved a new niche for
itself in the new digital information age.

According to Phil Faraci, general manager, Greely Hardcopy
Division, HP, scanners are becoming "everyday devices". They are
now adopted as digital input devices in mainstream business
offices.

Faraci said the new concept is "scan to share", bridging paper and
digital communications. The benefits include faster transmission of
information, lower costs, and greater control as users can easily
manipulate information from the desktop and print only what is
needed.

Driving the demand for scanners are its ease-of-use, the growth in
computational memory power and the availability of low-cost output
devices.

"Three years ago, there were no low-cost output devices to exploit
the scanner's capabilities. Today the printer quality is improving,
hence the increase in scanner demand," said Faraci.

According to figures from market research firm InfoTrends Research
Group, the number of flatbed scanners is estimated to increase from
1.3 million in 1995 to 2.8 million in 1997.

DISPLAYS BECOMING BIGGER, BRIGHTER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

The 1996 Society for Information Display Symposium (SID), held in
the US earlier this year, reflected a number of diverging trends in
the display market.

According to Dave Mentley, VP of Display Industry Research at
Stanford Resources, there were a number of technical breakthroughs
which are close to commercialisation.

The viewing angle of LCDs is set to see some changes. "In a sign of
the maturing of the AM (active matrix) LCD market, viewing angle
improvement has become a major focus," he said. "What was once just
a minor nuisance and a point of differentiation between active and
passive matrix addressing has now become an obsession. The idea is
to get to the same viewing quality as the CRT monitor in an LCD."

Mentley noted that some LCD monitors today have better performance
than some CRT monitors.

"As with everything else, the means to improve the viewing angle is
very complicated," he said.

"The latest and most intriguing is the in-plane switching mode.
Hitachi's Super TFT is based on this technique and NEC just
unveiled their version. Both samples were nothing short of
stunning."

Mentley stressed that the technique is actually decades old, but
the tools to implement it became available only recently.

"The results so far show that they do work and clearly can be
made," he said.

Other improvements in viewing angle employ high voltage drivers,
such as those by Vivid, thinner cell spacing, and multiple
alignment domains.

Another clear trend during the show had to do with packaging, such
as that for notebook computers.

"Notebook computer users used to ask why the manufacturers left so
much of a border around the display. Why not just make the display
bigger?" Mentley explained.

Mentley said that Mitsubishi had unveiled at the show a new 12.1-
inch TFT LCD with a 3.5-mm border at the bottom, so that the
distance from the bottom of the module to the edge of the display
viewing area is only 3.5 mm.

"The left and top borders are larger, but not by an excessive
amount. This is quite a feat of mechanical and electrical
packaging," he observed.

"The ability to do this advanced packaging could separate the
display world into the haves and have-nots of packaging, and this
will have serious implications for the ability to address advanced
applications. High density electronic packaging is not a trivial
task."

CRTS vs Flat Panels

CRTs may lose their place one day to flat panel monitors, and
progress is being made. "The wide angle TFT LCDs discussed above
play a key role in the viability of this market," said Mentley.

"Price clearly plays the biggest role. At the SID meeting, NEC
quietly unveiled a 20.x-inch, 1280 by 1,024 display based on a type
of in-plane switching. The display was truly astounding. There were
one or two dead sub-pixels out of about 3 million.

"The viewing angle was about plus and minus 80 degrees in the
horizontal and vertical. The colours were saturated and it used
analog addressing.

"Samples are expected to go out at US$5,000 later this year. Expect
every stock trader in the US to have about five of these things."

Mentley felt that the progress was due to the bottom dropping out
of the 8.x to 10.x-inch TFT market.

"Since these smaller displays apparently can't even be given away,
it makes sense to take the old fabs and make something that is
desired," he said.

"Instead of 4-up 9.4- or 10.4-inchers, why not make a 1-up 20.8-
incher? It won't be a multi-million unit market, but the high end
of the monitor market has been begging for workstation-type flat
panel displays for years. IBM/DTI is reportedly doing a similar
thing with their 16-inch TFT LCD, but without the in-plane
switching."

Mentley added that  Fujitsu announced a workstation-quality, 25-
inch diagonal, 1,280 by 1,024 colour AC plasma display by 1997.

"This is the first time that anything better than 0.50 mm dot pitch
has been discussed for colour plasma. How they will produce it is
still unclear," he said.

Miniature displays, which are sub-one-inch, high resolution (more
than or equal to VGA format) displays, are another area to watch,
according to Mentley.

"Some of the most intriguing research and development work is going
on in the miniature display area. Besides the poly-silicon thin
film transistor, there are many new approaches," he said.

"Thin film EL, diffraction gratings with and without Liquid
Crystal, polymer dispersed LC on Silicon, LED, FEDs, field
sequential PDLC on a chip and the DMD are a few of the most
developed approaches.

"There are probably many more. We should expect very good colours
and high pixel counts in the near future."

Mentley presented his findings in the May 1996 issue of
International Display Report, an electronic publication from the
SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International)
Newsletter Service.

CHINA'S NETWORK HUNGER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

The China networking market started to boom in 1993 and by 1994,
almost all the well-known US vendors rushed in, fueling even faster
growth. Between 1993 and 1995, the market quadrupled in size.

Although the networking market accounts for less than one tenth of
the total IT market, its share is increasing.

In 1995, 1.15 million PCs were sold in China. With about 42 per
cent currently connected to a network, the network market was worth
RMB4.5 billion (US$540 million) in 1995.

Network users in China however are in general not familiar with
advanced network applications such as voice and image
transmissions, and primarily use the network to transfer files or
share resources.

China started to build large scale computer networks in the early
1980s when the government built 12 WANs.

These WANs included the Railway Information Network, Banking
Network, and Meteorological Information Network.

The Railway Information System was the earliest nation-wide
network. It has 4 levels, with 70 nodes per level for a total of
700 medium and small computers, 20,000 PCs, and 4,000 terminals.

By the end of 1995, about 1.11 million computers were connected
into networks. The average growth of the connection rate has been
about 37 per cent a year since 1990.

The percentage of computers networked grew about five times between
1990 and 1995.

Still Low-End?

Nearly 80 per cent of networked computers are PCs. The rest are
workstations, servers, and larger computers. About 51 per cent of
the networks are LANs. Over half of the LANs are primarily utilised
for file sharing. Around 10 per cent of the LANs are also used for
e-mail.

Most of the WANs were low-speed. An ordinary telephone line is the
most common connection method. Over half of the WANs run at 2.4
Kbps, although 9.6 Kbps is becoming more popular.

Point-to-point data transmission accounted for more than half of
WAN usage, while e-mail accounted for 21 per cent.

Buying Criteria

China still functions on price. The Chinese usually seek the latest
technology at the lowest price. During the earlier phase of the
networking industry, lower prices won the tug-of-war. However,
higher functionality is starting to become more important.

Price ranks as the most important criteria when buying networking
equipment, but it also represents the number one impediment to new
technology.

New technology, such as ATM, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet, and
Intelligent Switching Hubs are expected to become more popular only
at the turn of the century.

The Golden Projects

The Chinese government's national information infrastructure
projects are the key market. The Golden Projects alone drive a
large segment of the network market.

The Golden Bridge project will run from 1993 to 2002 and develop an
infrastructure for State macro-economic planning activities. It
will link information centres in the 30 provinces and
municipalities, covering 500 cities.

The system will involve a satellite-based ISDN network and fibre
optic land-based system and rival the ChinaPAC and SESA services
provided by the MPT.

The total investment in the project is currently projected at about
RMB20 billion (US$2.38 billion).

The Golden Customs project will run from 1993 to 2003, linking
information systems in foreign trade companies to form an EDI
network. This will also  lead to automatic customs declarations.

The system will run on a satellite backbone using e-mail and EDI
applications linking many different foreign trade departments of
government and industry.

The first phase of EDI implementation is already complete with a
pilot system at Beijing's Capital Airport and two further systems
are being installed in Shanghai and Guangzhou.

The Golden Card project will run from 1993 to 2003 and is designed
to develop a system of national banking transaction cards.

The development of two national information centres will be central
to the project. The basic aim is to build credit and cash usage
amongst China's 300 million urban residents. Currently there are
only 3.2 million cards in the whole country.

Network decisions are still being made and Golden Card could use
either Golden Bridge and ChinaPAC (the MPT packet switching
service), or both.

The Golden Tax project runs from 1994 to 1998 and supports the
recent development of a national value-added tax system.

The project will be based around the Clearing Centre of the
People's Bank of China which already has an extensive network with
over 100 servers and 4,000 terminals.

In its initial phases, Golden Tax will create a demand for RMB500
million (US$59.5 million) in hardware and software.

The Golden Medical project started operation in 1995 and is being
designed to provide accurate health care information on a national
basis.

The system will be based on the Golden Bridge network and will
initially connect around 50 hospitals.

The Golden Intelligence or CERNET project began in 1995 and is
designed to link all university campus networks, eventually
spreading to middle and primary schools.

By the end of century, CERNET will be the biggest Internet user in
China. Initially, there will be one main network centre with 10
satellite centres around the country.

The Golden Enterprises project will begin in 1996 and is designed
to improve information flow between enterprises and between
business and government.

This system will be based on the Golden Bridge network.

The Golden Agricultural project will commence in 1996 and establish
a national agriculture database. Again the Golden Bridge network
will be used for the project.

The Green Card project will run from 1995 to 2000 and is designed
to implement a national network to support the deposits and
withdrawals from Post Office savings accounts.

It is worth noting that China, after Japan, has the second highest
savings rate of any major economy at around 33 per cent.

Again, the Golden Bridge network will be used for this system.
Ultimately, the system will have to cover 10,000 post offices in
500 cities.

Forecast Ahead

In addition to Golden Projects, the 12 nation-wide National
Information Networks established in the 7th Five Year Plan need to
be upgraded.

The networks involve economics, science and technology, public
security, defence, statistics, post & telecommunication,
electricity, civil aviation, meteorological, railway, and
population control.

These projects will need an estimated investment of RMB100 billion
(US$12 billion) over the next 10 years. The Chinese government
plans to provide 20 per cent of this.

More than 50 per cent of the technology and equipment used in the
projects are already network industry products.

Assuming that the government follows through on its commitments,
the China network market will be worth at least RMB5 billion
(US$600 million) over the next decade.

If private investment follows, the market potential for the
countrywide networking projects will be around RMB10 billion (US$
1.2 billion) per year during the next 10 years.

The size of the Chinese network market in 1996 will also reach
RMB10 billion (US$1.2 billion).

The market will continue to grow at a healthy clip.

The most popular segments will relate to the Internet, on-line
information services, network training and technology transfer.

SERVICE PROVIDERS PUT USERS ABOVE ALL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by William Oei

NETWORK servicing in the Asia-Pacific is becoming increasingly
sophisticated as Western-based vendors start scaling up their
operations here.

Anixter, for example, recently unveiled a grand masterplan to
expand its presence here, spending over US$10 million in 1996 alone
on building up its infrastructure.

ITS, a division of the SITA Network Group, also announced an
increase in its service offerings in the region, unwrapping three
new services for Cisco users and a flexible package scheme from its
Cisco Technical Assistance Centre in Australia.

"We are not in the drop-ship business where you can get by without
interfacing with the customers," said Bob Grubbs, president and
CEO, Anixter, who was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, recently.

"We have to get down to the end-user level and get in touch with
the customers."

This, as the company found out, was not always so easy in this part
of the world.

"Restrictions in some parts of Asia such as Indonesia, India and
Vietnam sometimes prevent us from achieving this," said Kuala
Lumpur-based Jimmy Goh, managing director, Southeast Asia, Anixter.

"In these cases, we have no choice but to work through partners and
distributors. We have to be flexible enough to adapt to different
economic and political situations."

Anixter, who has reseller agreements with vendors such as Bay
Networks, IBM and Xylan, plans to leverage its core competencies in
value-added distribution, cabling systems and project
implementation for networks.

According to Grubbs, the greatest challenges for the networking
industry in Asia is the shortage of skills here and the incomplete
public network infrastructure.

To help ease the skills shortage problem and to add value to its
basket of service offerings, the company is in the midst of setting
up training facilities for the transfer of networking skills to
Asia.

"We want to be the greatest value-added providers," said KH Wun,
president of Anixter Asia-Pacific.

"The holders of technical knowledge in the US currently don't have
a proper means of transferring knowledge to Asian customers. We
want to help fill this void."

He added that training and education only accounts for about 3 per
cent of Anixter's total business but the company seems happy with
that level of revenue contribution.

"We are transitioning to a specialist company to focus on building
the network infrastructure," said Wun.

"That's our vision and our ultimate goal. In some parts of the
world, we have already achieved this but not in Asia."

To achieve its objectives here, Anixter has been steadily putting
the necessary pieces in place.

"The staffing for the Asia-Pacific has increased by a large scale,
both in numbers and skillsets," said Wun.

"For example, the Southeast Asian offices have tripled its
recruitment of skilled personnel over the past year. We have also
boosted our infrastructure with bigger sales and warehousing
locations and ventured into new territories such as Vietnam."

In Southeast Asia, the fastest growing market for Anixter,
Malaysia, has been at the centre of the company's expansion
activities.

"Malaysia is now the regional headquarters of our Southeast Asian
operations," said Low.

"We are setting up training facilities and an interoperability lab
in the Malaysia office to better serve our customers in the
surrounding areas."

He added that the interoperability lab will serve as a testbed for
functional testing of different LAN and WAN configurations when it
is fully operational by year-end.

SITA subsidiary, ITS, is also increasing its service offerings to
cater to the maturing demands of its networking customers in the
region.

"As a service company, it is imperative that we look after our
customers," said Andy Cocks, director of the newly set up ITS Asia-
Pacific Australasia client services division.

"The new client services division will enhance this strategy by
introducing a number of customer-focused initiatives."

Three new packages - Cisco Essential; Cisco Plus; and Cisco Select,
boost the company's Global LAN Internetworking Solution, a
worldwide integrator partnership that the company signed in June
with Cisco.

"Customers no longer require break/fix support," said Cocks.

"As products become more complex, we need to be able to offer
value-add in troubleshooting, product information and software
updates."

ANIXTER PICKS SCITOR FOR DATACOMMS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Value-added network services provider Scitor has been awarded a
US$8 million, three-year contract by Anixter, to provide data
communications services for Anixter in 60 locations across the
world.

Anixter has replaced its multi-vendor overseas data network with
Scitor's global network, a network which spans 225 countries.

Anixter will implement Scitor's Frame Relay, ISDN dial back-up
services and real-time network monitoring platform.

NETMANAGE HOLDS ALL THE ACES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

NETMANAGE, the vendor behind the Chameleon range of desktop
applications, is taking a holistic approach to the intranet market
with a full suite of products.

"Browsers only constitute one-sixth of the intranet market and will
not be our main focus," said Bobby Srinivasan, managing director,
Asia-Pacific & Latin America, NetManage.

"We have been involved in the Internet ever since we were
established in 1990. In fact we wrote Winsock which was one of the
factors which precipitated the growth of the Internet."

HK TELECOM LEADS IN ATM TECHNOLOGY USE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Yap Cheng Theng

HONGKONG Telecom became one of the earliest adopters of ATM
technology in the region when it launched an ATM service with
fibre-optic access running at 155 Mbps in Hong Kong.

According to Jeff Lui, senior product manager, ATM services,
Hongkong Telecom, the company began looking into such services back
in 1994.

Trials began only in September last year and spilled through to
March this year. The two companies that took part in the trials
were the Hospital Authority and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.

Trials have also been conducted internationally with Cable &
Wireless Trans-Atlantic, Taiwan's ITA and US-based Sprint over
satellite link.

There will be three phases to Hongkong Telecom's ATM project which
involved HK$70 million (US$9 million).

The first phase will provide ATM connection; the second will
provide integration with its FrameLink service, based on Frame
Relay technology; and the third will be to provide international
ATM access and integration with other services.

The second phase is expected to be launched within a year, and the
third phase depends on market demand, said Lui.

Four ATM loops have been built, two each in Hong Kong island and
Kowloon.

Explaining Hongkong Telecom's focus on both ISDN and ATM
technologies, Lui said the company will continue to offer both
services, with ISDN phase target small and medium businesses and
ATM at large corporate customers.

Hongkong Telecom is also investigating 25 Mbps ATM technology as an
option on the desktop.

The monthly rental for the first 15 km of the ATM service is
HK$16,000 (US$2,064 ) and every additional 20 km costs  HK$10,000
(US$1,290).

Other tariffs involved are installation costs of HK$32,000
(US$4,128), internal relocation at HK$16,000 (US$2,064) and
external relocation costs of HK$32,000 (US$4,128).

CAN CA'S OPENINGRES LAST THE LONG HAUL?

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

TALK about rebirth of a product, one can't help but take a hard
look at OpenIngres.

This RDBMS, formerly the core product of ASK/Ingres, was acquired
by Computer Associates (CA) three years ago, but now seems to be
hanging cold out there in the market.

To be fair, CA has added new features to OpenIngres, in line with
its intention of acquiring first and integrating later.

Recently, this RDBMS was given another injection to ensure its
longevity. CA wants it to be open and to run on hardware platforms
from desktops to enterprise servers.

The maintenance release of OpenIngres 1.2/01 will be first made
available for Sun Solaris 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5x by next month.

Other platforms targeted for release before the end of November
this year are HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, IBM AIX 3.2x, 4.1x, Windows NT 3.51,
DEC Open VMS 6.1, 6.2 (Alpha and VAX), DEC Unix 3.2x, Sun OS 4.1.3,
SCO OpenServer 5.0, UnixWare 2.0x, NCR GIS 2.03x as well as servers
from Data General, Pyramid, Sequent and Siemens.

Added Features

Added features include SMP, cluster SMP and MPP technologies to
ensure support for intelligent datawarehouse and replication across
all environments, and OpenIngres/ICE for Internet/Intranet
functionalities.

Despite these additions, the survival of OpenIngres in the
marketplace is doubtful.

Allan Tan, industry analyst, Worldwide Services Group, Dataquest
Asia-Pacific, said OpenIngres is comparatively not popular in Hong
Kong.

Overall, the largest RDBMS player in Asia is still Oracle, followed
by either Informix or Sybase.

On the Unix platform, OpenIngres is facing challenges from IBM's
DB2 as well.

While there is a potential market for OpenIngres, Tan does not see
it coming  close to what has been achieved by the other three
players.

"A database vendor should be perceived as having good alliances
with hardware vendors. CA's profile hasn't really been strong in
this region," said Tan.

He said another drawback is CA's strategy of offering dual database
with OpenIngres and Jasmine, the OODBMS with a multimedia and
Internet-enabled toolset.

No Hybrid Applications

At CA World '96 in New Orleans recently, chairman and CEO Charles
Wang  made it clear that CA does not believe in hybrid applications
in the database arena and has no plans to combine the two products,
except to leverage on each other's technology.

"History has shown that it is hard for any vendor to offer two
types of databases as it create confusion in the marketplace," said
Tan.

According to Dataquest's first half 1995 estimates, the worldwide
RDBMS revenues of US$2.5 billion are split between IBM with 35 per
cent market share, Oracle with 19 per cent, CA with 11 per cent,
Sybase 8 per cent, Informix 5 per cent and the remaining going to
smaller players.

However, on both the server database and Unix database market, CA
was not even listed in Dataquest's top list of players.

The first half 1995 estimates for server database worldwide are
US$2.2 billion and a significant market share is split between IBM
with 40 per cent, Oracle 18 per cent, Sybase 9 per cent and
Informix 6 per cent.

On the Unix platform, however, Oracle dominates.

Out of the US$770 million estimates for the first half of 1995 for
Unix database, Oracle grabbed 48 per cent, Sybase 21 per cent and
Informix 16 per cent.

OpenIngres' survival is further challenged with the emergence of
Universal Server offered both by Oracle and Informix.

CA has not made any indication of ever offering Universal Server
functionality.

In a white paper by market research firm Aberdeen Group for July
1996, Universal Servers have been considered the RDBMS technology
for the next decade.

Although RDBMS has survived for 20 years focusing on simple types
of data such as integers, scientific floating point, character
strings, date/time and money, the research firm said RDBMSes are
under considerable technology pressure as "they do not handle
highly complex information well".

Universal Servers, on the other hand, the paper said, "will allow
IS organisations to extend their current RDBMS to handle complex
data types and work better with new technologies such as Intranets,
relational OLAP and latest development toolsets, ensuring that
enterprises can continue to leverage their existing investments in
RDBMS".

Challenges Ahead

While CA's effort in injecting more features and functionalities to
OpenIngres is commendable,  there are also others who remain
sceptical.

At Ingres World '96 in New Orleans in conjunction with CA World
'96, John Gilworth, Ingres System Administrator, Information
Systems Department of US-based HealthCare Compare was positive to
the changes and enhancements made to OpenIngres.

"Ingres is starting to lose third party support but with the new
enhancements, I believe CA is coming up as a strong player now. It
is important for CA to continue development support for Ingres," he
said.

Another Ingres user, Randall Eash, VP, Technical Service said CA's
major problem is implementation and belated execution of marketing
strategy.

It looks like CA has an uphill task ahead in getting Ingres back
into the mainstream of enterprises.

While it remains to be seen whether OpenIngres can survive further,
pressure is definitely mounting on CA's shoulders to prove its
critics wrong.

The heat is on, CA.

DIGITAL MCS GETS ISO 9002 FOR CUSTOMER SERVICES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Customer requirements are behind the recent ISO 9002 certification
awarded to Digital's Multivendor Customer Service Centre, said
Matthew Liang, director, Multivendor Customer Services, Digital
Equipment Hong Kong.

He said Digital MCS is the first vendor to obtain an ISO 9002
certification for multivendor customer services in Hong Kong.

In the case of the MCS, ISO certification revolved around creating
a framework for standard processes and continuous improvement for
customer services like complaint handling.

Regina Luk, logistics and distribution manager, Digital MCS, Hong
Kong, said the ISO certification effort began in November 1995,
culminating with the ISO 9002 award from the Hong Kong Quality
Assurance Agency this July.

SCO AIMING TO BE LEADER IN UNIX SYSTEM SOFTWARE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

THE Santa Cruz (SCO) has extended its product offerings, aiming to
be the leading supplier of Unix system software for business
critical environments.

Explaining SCO's vision, Certina Ma, sales and marketing manager,
North Asia, SCO, said product directions will focus on three areas.

The first area is its commitment to deliver Windows to Unix
integration, with the announcement of a new product called Vision
FS, a file and print server. This follows its acquisition of IXI
and VisionWare.

Vision FS is the latest addition to SCO's Vision Family of Windows
to Unix integration products that include XVision, a PC server;
TermVision, a terminal emulator which allows PC users to store and
retrieve files in Unix; SQL Retriever, a tool to access SQL
database and SuperVision, a systems management tool.

The second area is the merged product of OpenServer and UnixWare
called Gemini, scheduled to be out by mid-1997.

In Asia, Ma said OEM sales for Gemini will be concentrated in
Taiwan, Korea and Japan.

However, in the run up to Gemini, SCO will continue to deliver
enhanced versions of OpenServer and UnixWare i.e. OpenServer 5.0.4
and UnixWare 2.1.1, bundled with migration tool kits for Gemini.

A layered product solution is SCO's third focus. Aimed at providing
Internet and connectivity services, its latest announcement is the
OEM availability of Network Client Operating System (NC/OS).

SCO claims NC/OS is the first low-cost, small footprint software
designed as a reliable, time-to-market solution for developing
Network Computers on standard Intel-based processors.

MOTOROLA PREPARES TO HIT MOBILE PC MARKET

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

Motorola has begun the Asian rollout for PC Card-based
multifunction peripherals to catch the wave in the fast growing
corporate mobile computing market.

"Three million PC Card (PCMCIA) modems are expected to ship
worldwide in 1996," said US-based Bob Leibowitz, director of
marketing, Mobile Computing Products Division, Information Systems
Group, Motorola.

"Modem-and-LAN adapters are a small but important part, with about
300,000 expected to ship in 1996." Leibowitz said that until
recently, it had been more expensive to buy a combination PC card
than purchasing each function separately.

The company will focus on countries where the notebook market is
more mature, namely Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore
and Hong Kong.

Said Leibowitz: "We will provide features that customers want at a
reasonable price with Motorola quality and support."

Leibowitz said that compressed transmission of voice, video and
data would fuel the popularity of applications like
videoconferencing, whiteboarding, and technical support through
remote diagnosis.

The killer application for PC card modems, however, would be the
intranet, he said.

Though the products were launched in the US in March, their
introduction was delayed in Asia because of homologatory
requirements. According to the company, products which conform to
PTT requirements are approved in 30 to 90 days.

Motorola's Information Systems Group, the umbrella organisation for
the Mobile Computing Products Division, plans to seek out resellers
who can offer custom bundles unique to their areas.

"The resellers are closer to the marketplace," said Ron Waeghe, VP
and GM, Asia-Pacific, ISG, Motorola. "The right software today
might be the wrong software tomorrow."

Products launched by the company include Montana, a 28.8 data/fax
modem PC card, and Mariner, a 28.8 data/fax/LAN card with cellular
connectivity, together with the secure SecurID modem.

H.K. WILL INCREASE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Motorola's Information Services Group plans to set up an Internet-
based response centre for technical support from Hong Kong, its
Asia-Pacific headquarters within a year.

Ron Waeghe, VP and GM, Asia-Pacific, ISG, Motorola Asia-Pacific,
said that the secure Web site, which would provide answers to
requests from simple questions to full-blown technical support, is
currently being tested by distributors.

Technical support is being offered  directly by Motorola's ISG in
Hong Kong, Japan, and India, and also through value-added
distributors.

Waeghe also said that collaboration between groups in the largely
decentralised Motorola was probable, though this was in the
preliminary stages.

"There is synergy between the Motorola Computer Group and the
Information Systems Group. We could package ISP solutions for the
marketplace."

Waeghe said that in the Asia-Pacific, the ISG grew 400 per cent
from year-end 1994, and the run rate had doubled since last year.

NEW M'SOFT OS GOES DOWN TO PDA LEVEL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

On September 16, Microsoft formally announced their newest
operating system that is designed to be used on devices other than
a desktop computer.

Its initial use will be in a hand-held computer, originally known
as Pegasus, but now referred to as the HPC (or hand-held PC).

Microsoft had originally planned to introduce this new OS at Comdex
on November 17, but sources say they moved up the launch date to
get another message into the market quickly.

The OS inside Pegasus will now be called Windows CE. It had been
code named Gryphon.

The CE stands for Compact Edition, but it could also stand for
consumer electronics.

It is so named because Microsoft will push this OS for use in
various consumer electronics products that deal with digital data
access and delivery.

When the HPC makes its debut later in November, it will be
positioned as a mobile desktop companion.

The HPC concept is a hand-held computer that reportedly looks much
like the popular HP 200 LX, only slightly larger.

It will be positioned as a mobile Windows device that allows users
to carry desktop data with them wherever they go.

Although small in size, it will have a very clean approach to
synchronising data with the desktop.

Think of it as a data take-away device that allows you to pull
files off the desktop and take them with you anywhere you go.

While Windows CE is a different OS from Windows and all
applications for it will have to be written from scratch, it has
the same GUI as Windows 95.

That makes it very easy to learn and use.

Critical Product

This new OS from Microsoft is a critical product for them if they
are to take Windows beyond the traditional desktop PC market.

There is no way that they can downsize the original Windows 95 OS
for use on low-powered, small memory and low-cost based digital
consumer appliances.

Windows CE can work in one megabyte of DRAM and can also be used on
systems with processors other than those made by Intel.

Microsoft' s Windows CE will cause the analytical community to
focus on this operating system and its potential for use in real
consumer products.

This new OS is Microsoft's response to the recent Navio challenge
in their current tit for tat browser war with Netscape.

Microsoft stressed that Windows CE is for any "digital appliance"
and used examples of smart phones, smart set-top boxes and even
auto GPS systems to explain how Windows CE can be used in the
market.

The smart phone idea is perhaps the most important first real
digital appliance for the home that either Microsoft or Netscape
can focus on.

Web Applications

Although there are many vendors trying to get a Web TV into the
home as the first low cost Internet appliance, many of us who look
at the consumer adoption cycle for technology are not convinced the
Web TV will be successful.

For one thing, the traditional consumer is used to getting his
information from nightly newscasts that come in the form of live
full motion video, with various media rich illustrations.

But, the Web as it is today, delivers information only in text and
pictures.

The traditional consumer wants information delivered over the Net
instantly and with real time video, audio, animation and 3D.

Getting that on the Web will take much greater bandwidth and could
be years away.

On the other hand, I think that the consumer is ready and
interested in a phone that lets them e-mail.

One approach to this is a smart phone that is application specific.

That means that this device would connect to an existing phone and
be a keyboard and small screen in which the consumer can send e-
mail messages at will.

All they would need is a connection to some type of e-mail service,
such as ATT Mail or MCI Mail and the e-mail address of the person
they want to send their message to.

This "smart phone" could also be modular and although at first
might just be a small screen, keyboard and modem, it might be
upgradeable to take a larger screen, which you could then use for
Internet access to Internet Yellow Pages and the Web.

The initial smart phone for e-mail access would be very low cost,
although it would need to be based on some type of consumer OS.

That is where Microsoft's Windows CE and Netscape's Navio products
have real early consumer potential.

Future Potential

Over time, a consumer electronics OS, whether it be an off shoot of
Windows 95 like Windows CE is, or Navio's consumer technology,
which would be tied to Netscape's Navigator, could also be used on
smart set-top boxes, CD-ROM- and DVD ROM-based systems connected to
the TV.

Someday in the future, it may actually become the OS for use on the
digital TV, stereo systems and any other digital appliance in the
home.

That is why these new announcements from Microsoft and Netscape are
so important.

They are clearly set to be the big guns going after the consumer
electronic space where digital appliances will rule, and where no
single OS or Web environment is a standard today.

Whoever wins this battle for the hearts and minds of the consumer
vendors and users, will be the biggest winners of this digital crap
shoot to bring technology to the home, which to us marketing folks,
is where the real numbers are.

CA REAPS BENEFITS OF CUSTOMER CARE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Eighteen thousand visitors from 66 countries, 150,000 diskettes
given out, over 30 million pages of text produced: that sums up CA
World '96, held in New Orleans to celebrate Computer Associates'
20th Anniversary.

Charles Wang, CEO, in his speech wanted his technology extravaganza
to be the friendliest and he may well have achieved it.

Wang even invited every attendee at this year's CA World to attend
CA World '97 for free!

A mere marketing ploy? After spending close to US$10 million to
hold the event, CA would definitely not want  its guests to go home
disappointed.

The point here is that innovation alone does not ensure success
today.

Good innovations along with good marketing strategy would assure a
far better success.

It is a matter of convincing users that your technology works for
them via innovative marketing tools. CA recognised this and is
moving forward.

For the past 20 years CA had three core strategies: internal
development, acquisitions and integration. In recent years, forming
strategic partnerships became equally important.

CA's strategy has its share of critics. Some of the more cynical
say it killed products it acquired and gives poor technical
support.

Yet the company is strong and is worth US$3.5 billion today.

Can it survive for the next 20 years? Wang admitted four main
challenges lay ahead of CA.

That is to find ways to build applications of the future; to manage
and deploy these applications across the enterprise; to perform
real, profitable business on the Internet and the World Wide Web;
and to heal the critical 'disconnect' between people and computers.

Product directions have been clear too: multimedia, object
modelling and OO technology are declared the way to go.

Can we really blame CA for trying to lure new customers and
maintain its customer base?

The success of a company depends on the whims of its customers who
may abandon it any time.

CA's bottom line is: deliver on your promise and technology. A
little bit of pampering does no harm either. It is an added value.

ATM WAN SWITCH SALES TOPPER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Newbridge Networks has topped the industry in ATM WAN switch sales
worldwide, according to IDC, Dataquest, Vertical Systems Group and
In-Stat.

IDC, in its 1995-2000 analysis of the frame relay and ATM equipment
markets, estimated that Newbridge had 40.5 per cent of the
worldwide revenue for ATM WAN switches.

According to IDC, the market for ATM WAN switches will jump from
US$247 million last year to US$543 million this year. Estimates
from the analysts for the worldwide ATM market by the year 2000
range from US$2 to US$3 billion.

NEWBRIDGE EQUIPS AUSSIE NETWORK

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Newbridge Networks has been chosen to supply equipment to Optus
Communications for Australia's first commercial ATM network,
OptusNet.

OptusNet, which has a maximum budget of US$30 million, will offer
high bandwidth applications such as high-speed LAN connections,
broadcast video, video-conferencing, high-speed Internet access and
intranet transport.

Under the terms of the five-year agreement, Newbridge will build on
Optus' existing nationwide synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)
infrastructure with a number of offerings.

The company will provide 36170 MainStreet ATMnet backbone switches,
which support both frame relay and ATM, in Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Canberra, Brisbane and Perth.

Multimedia and LAN interconnection services will be provided by the
36150 MainStreet ATMnet access switch, while the 36120 MainStreet
frame relay switch will handle lower-speed frame relay services.

Phil Jacobs, COO of Optus Communications, said that Optus is
confident that the Newbridge equipment will meet Optus' current
network needs, while providing a flexible platform for future
services and products.

BOARD ROOM RANGE TO CATER TO DEMAND

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

In view of projected demand, a range of board room products were
unveiled by PictureTel.

The roll-out includes LimeLight, a speech-activated technology that
automatically directs the camera to zoom and focus on the speaker

reconfiguration, viewing or editing group video conferencing.

Stephen Johnson, director of marketing, Group Systems Division,
PictureTel said in terms of revenues, rooms systems are selling at
a ratio of 3:1 over desktop systems, although he said that strong
growth is also coming from desktop systems.

PICTURETEL MAPS MAJOR GROWTH PLANS IN ASIA

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Yap Cheng Theng and Raymond Tan

PICTURETEL, which  consolidated its lead in the global
videoconferencing market this year, will go through an aggressive
growth phase in Asia, with plans to open up offices in Shanghai and
Kuala Lumpur within the next four months.

By the end of 1997, the company will add offices in Bangkok,
Jakarta and Guangzhou, said Peter Woo, regional director, Asia-
Pacific, PictureTel.

A customer service support centre in Singapore, to be operational
next month, is also in the pipeline to provide better support
partners and resellers, said Woo.

The Asia-Pacific currently contributes only 10 per cent of the
company's corporate revenues of US$346 million. Woo intends to
increase it to 15 per cent by the next calendar year.

Overall, PictureTel grew at a compounded rate of 50 per cent over
the last few years.

Steve Johnson, marketing director of PictureTel's group systems,
said the company has to date installed more than 26,000 group
videoconferencing systems.

"We had a good year in 1995, having added 4,500 group systems to
our installed base.

"More than 100 customers already own over 30 of our group systems.

"This makes us the market leader, and we now hold 51 per cent of
the global videoconferencing market," Johnson said.

He added that videoconferencing is becoming a mainstream
application among corporate businesses, with 21 of the top 25
companies in the US and 54 per cent of Fortune 500 companies being
users of PictureTel systems.

Asked about the company's desktop system installed base, Johnson
said both PictureTel and Intel command 85 per cent of the desktop
videoconferencing market.

"The market share split between us and Intel is about 50-50," he
said.

In an earlier interview with ACW, Norman Gaut, chairman and CEO of
PictureTel, said the desktop market is growing 100 per cent in both
unit and revenue terms.

He said the company will likely ship 50,000 desktop video
conferencing systems in fiscal year 1996, twice the amount
PictureTel shipped last year.

IBM BREAKING INTO ASIA'S EMERGING SOFTWARE INDUSTRY

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

IBM is investing for the future in the region with long-term
projects in China, India, and Vietnam.

"The Asia-Pacific software division is leading worldwide in IBM,"
said Mike Colleary, IBM's director, Emerging Markets, Asia
Pacific/Middle East with responsibilities for the software market.

He added that IBM would be building alliances and boosting skill
sets in expectation of future business opportunities in key
marketplaces.

According to Colleary, IBM is committed to grow the China and India
software industries.

"We are working with software developers to create applications,
and with governments, ministries and major enterprises to create
office automation breakthroughs," he said.

Colleary noted that China and India shared many similarities.

"Both of them are rapidly growing environments, with good potential
for software growth; they have native language requirements, and a
huge skill base for software products," he said.

"The difference is that projects in China are megaprojects, which
need a lot of sophistication, especially support from mainframes to
desktops. In India, projects are typical of corporate
organisations.

"Both are building software export as an industry. Developers want
to create programs and get returns on them instead of working for
offshore vendors."

Colleary added that IBM has an interest in the fledgling Vietnam
market as well.

"Vietnam is just starting," he said. "They don't have the growth of
India and China, and most of the business is done through
international companies.

"There is a need to build an infrastructure around automation and
computerisation. They need to drop barriers to market entry, and
get computer technology and application software to the masses."

IBM has gained momentum in establishing University Technology
Centres in China and India, which offer certification courses on
IBM software.

Colleary disclosed that IBM has invested over US$25 million in
China's education market alone.

REGION DIVIDED INTO 3 OPERATIONAL AREAS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

NCR last month regrouped the 11 countries in its Asian region into
three geographical areas, namely Greater China, Southeast Asia and
Korea.

NCR Greater China, headed by MD Peter Zee and headquartered in
Beijing, covers Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, while DW Choi will be
responsible for NCR Korea as VP, NCR Korea area.

Former NCR Asia MD, Victor Ang, has been promoted to VP, NCR
Southeast Asia area, and will oversee NCR Southeast Asia from
Singapore. The Southeast Asia region for NCR stretches from India
and Sri Lanka in the west to the Asean region in the south.

The company had its first profitable quarter since 1994 with second
quarter profits of US$11 million, with the Asian operations more
profitable than the corporate average, said Greater China MD, Zee.

NCR has targeted to become profitable in 1997, and should break
even by the end of this year. Zee explained that the company had
tried to take on too much before.

NCR SAYS RE-ALIGNMENT PROVIDES MORE FOCUS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

The recent re-alignment in NCR Corporation's Asian operations will
enable greater focus and growth for the company, said Peter Zee,
MD, NCR Greater China area, and president of NCR China.

According to Zee, the differences in the 11 countries covered by
NCR within its former Asia-China area in the past made it difficult
to cover the region properly.

"We grew so fast in the Asia-China area that we could not give
enough attention to each country," said Zee.

"Moreover, the geographies had different cultures and were at
different stages of development."

With NCR Asia now split into NCR Greater China, NCR Southeast Asia
and NCR Korea, the synergy within each sub-region has increased,
said Zee.

The heads of each sub-region are able to influence corporate
policy, in contrast to one voice before.

"There is a lot of business synergy," Zee said. "We understand the
customer requirements better. Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan are all
Chinese speaking countries, and the economies are very close."

He added that NCR Greater China will continue to focus on its core
competencies. "We are definitely in the computer business,
especially for high availability, transaction processing, and
datawarehousing technologies," said Zee.

"We are also a leading IT solutions provider in the financial,
retail and computer industries."

Zee said that NCR had invested heavily in the financial industry in
Greater China in the past and is now expanding into mid-range and
high-end computing. The current focus is to support Unix and
Windows NT.

As such, Zee said that the corporate structure within NCR Greater
China would be leveraged to help customers understand and manage
their businesses better.

Another challenge for Zee is the rapid growth of China, where NCR
Greater China is based.

"We do not have enough resources to keep up with the growth," he
said. "China is too big for us to set up branches in every
location."

NCR's solution is to work with channel partners, but a delicate
balance has to be achieved.

"We need enough partners to help us to grow, but not too many as to
create a price war," Zee said.

"We are looking for value-added channels, who can provide
solutions, rather than just box-movers."

CHECK POINT SETS UP BASE IN SINGAPORE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Check Point Software Technologies has formally set foot in Asia
with the opening of a Singapore office.

The company has close to 10,000 installations worldwide, 15 per
cent of which are in the Asia-Pacific, including Japan.

The office, headed by regional manager Anthony Lim, will develop
and support Check Point's OEM and channel partners in Asia,
excluding Japan.

"Singapore was chosen as it is an easy place to do business in,"
said Marius Nacht, VP, Check Point Software."Everything is well
organised. The need for the product is there, and the
infrastructure is there. It was also easy to find good technical
resources."

"Singapore is a geographical and logistical hub," added Lim. "Many
companies and partners already have big offices there."

Nacht said he may add more offices in Asia, with Hong Kong as a
possible site.

The company has a distribution presence in Japan, Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and India.

ASIAN FIRMS UNWILLING TO PAY FOR FIREWALL SECURITY

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

It is a paradox: firewalls are known to be an essential hedge
against Internet hacking, yet many companies are not willing to
purchase them in Asia.

"Users expect firewalls to be cheap or free in this part of the
world, " said Anthony Lim, Singapore-based regional manager, Check
Point Software Technologies.

Marius Nacht, US-based VP, Check Point Software Technologies,
explained that firewalls were designed to allow firms to connect to
the Internet or each other without exposing themselves.

"The router is the most basic security device, but it is not
sufficient," he said. "For a minimum level of security, users need
a gateway computer running Unix or NT, with firewall software
installed."

Nacht said users should ensure that their firewalls include access
control, user authentication, encryption across networks, gateways
and PCs, reporting and auditing, as well as have anti-virus
capabilities.

Most of these features are already available in Check Point's
flagship Firewall-1 application.

Nacht added that virus detection capability and a high availability
version of Firewall-1 are targeted for delivery at year-end.

"We are also looking into developing active network management
functions," he said.

According to a February 1996 report by IDC, worldwide firewall
shipments are expected to hit 1.5 million units by the year 2000.

The research firm said that Check Point had a 40 per cent of the
global market share for commercial firewall software in 1995, with
its closest competitor holding only 9 per cent share worldwide.

"We are by far the leading firewall company,"said Nacht, dismissing
the threat of a shakeout in firewall companies.

"If anyone has to give up the business it sure won't be us."

In its three years of operations, Check Point has gained close to
10,000 customers, including names such as DHL and Ericsson,
worldwide.

In the second quarter ended July 31, Check Point Software
Technologies earned US$7.3 million in revenues, a 373 per cent
increase over the US$1.5 million sales for the same period in 1995.
Net income rose 284.7 per cent to US$3.2 million.

SYMANTEC ANNOUNCES SECOND INTERNET TOOL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

SYMANTEC has launched another Internet-specific product, Internet
FastFind following the announcement of Cafe, a Java-based
development tool.

According to Daniel Schneersohn, regional director, Symantec,
Internet FastFind is a set of tools allowing users to search
information on the Internet easily.

"Some of the frustrations of surfing the Internet are that it's too
slow, it takes too long to find what you're asking for or not
finding it at all," he said.

With Internet FastFind, Symantec claimed users need no longer put
up with these frustrations.

Internet FastFind combines simultaneous multi-engine search,
notification of changes to selected Web sites, FTP and network
sites, extensive Internet file searching as well as zipping and
unzipping capabilities.

Compatible with both English and Chinese Windows 95, it lets users
simultaneously search several search engines such as AltaVista,
Yahoo and Infoseek, check for duplicates, prioritise and present
the information in one Web page. It is available for Win 95 and
NT4.0, but a Mac version is being evaluated.

NEC WINS S'PORE PROJECTOR DEAL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

NEC Singapore has won a tender by the National Computer Board (NCB)
to supply all primary schools in Singapore with its MultiSync MT600
LCD projectors.

The tender is part of NCB's AITP (Accelerating the Use of IT in
Primary Schools) programme.

NEC's tender, worth S$3 million (US$2.1 million), includes the
installation and maintenance of 400 MT600 projectors which carry a
street price of around S$9,999 (US$7,089) per unit.

"The Singapore government have realised the importance of equipping
students with a firm grounding in computer-literacy," said Noel
Hon, MD, NEC Singapore.

"NEC has always been a strong advocate of the use of IT in
education. This tender helps us to promote our goal."

The tender win also boosted NEC's average sales of the MT600, a
product it first launched in May in Singapore this year, to 100
units per month.

This figure, said Hon, accounts for 30 per cent of the total
projector market in Singapore.

NEC Singapore's other projects in the education field include
Super-Yuki Pro, a multimedia learning software program, for the
Student-Teacher Workbench and a soon to be announced project with
the National Institute of Education.

FORRESTER REPORT GIVES NETWARE THUMBS DOWN

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

A recent report from Forrester Research, Novell at the Crossroads,
has concluded that large corporations no longer consider Novell a
strategic vendor and believe NetWare is a legacy operating
environment.

Interviews with 50 senior IT executives revealed that while 90 per
cent of large companies use NetWare today, only about half of them
or 48 per cent, said they would still use it in three years.

It was also found that 72 per cent of those polled said Novell will
not play a part in their Internet/ intranet plans.

"Users are very dissatisfied with Novell," said Jon Oltsik, analyst
with Forrester's Computing Strategy Service.

"Large companies believe NetWare is a legacy technology. NT seems
like a better strategic solution - it can do file and print, run
applications, and includes native support of TCP/IP."

"So far, Novell's marketing message - that NetWare will seamlessly
transition into the Intranet - has fallen on deaf ears.

"IT managers are already building the Intranet with Netscape,
Microsoft or Lotus. Novell is not even on the radar screen," said
Oltsik.

While Novell prepares products to address user needs - like native
TCP/IP and cross-platform services - it will face 18 months of
decreased sales volumes.

Forrester estimated that Novell's revenue will decrease by 25 per
cent this fiscal year and continue to decline until 1998 when it
settles at around US$1 billion.

Oltsik added: "Before its next-generation products are ready,
Novell will have to lower prices and offer bundled solutions to
encourage its installed base to upgrade."

While Novell is in trouble, it is not out of the game. Oltsik has
two things in its favour: a strong balance sheet and a large
installed base.

But according to Forrester, intranet technologies will ultimately
replace NetWare, so Novell needs to quickly transition into a
provider of standards-based services that enable the intranet.

NetWare On Ice

The report recommended that large companies put their NetWare
environments on ice for the next two years and evaluate new
intranet technologies and vendors as they emerge.

"CIOs should not panic and rip out NetWare. The right thing to do
is spend tactically on file and print for the next two years and
begin to implement intranet protocols and products as they mature,"
said Oltsik

HOW THE ANALYSTS VIEW HP

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

"HP will be maintaining its stronghold No. 2 position but it is
being too ambitious about wanting to be No. 1 by next year.

"Compaq is the clear leader. I don't see HP displacing Compaq as
No. 1 over the next one or two years. It may be a little late. For
one, its networking products have never been price competitive.

"Acer will get stronger, and possibly at the expense of the others
but not HP or Compaq. IBM too will get stronger, although Digital
is still floundering.

Norman Miranda, managing analyst, Datapro Information Services

"The two markets that will determine Hewlett-Packard's chances at
being No. 1 are China and Australia where Compaq has been the
leader.

HP is already outselling Compaq in China. If HP becomes stronger in
Australia, then its goal may not be out of its reach.

"IBM continues to be strong; doing well in China and Australia.
Acer is also doing well in Hong Kong and Malaysia but it is still
not strong in the corporate side in some developed markets.

The strong players in the long run are Compaq, IBM and HP."

BIG SERVER PLAYERS BITE BIGGER CHUNKS

The PC server hardware market is showing signs of an impending
shake out. The low-level players, now holding a smaller piece of
the pie, are buckling under pressure from the big boys like Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard, Acer and IBM.

Quoting the top five rankings by IDC in Q2'96 for the Asia-Pacific
server market, Steve Haslett, marketing manager of HP's Personal
Information Products Group, said Compaq continues to lead the pack
with a 22.7 per cent share, followed by Hewlett-Packard with 13.3
per cent.

Trailing behind are Acer and Digital with 10 and 7.8 per cent
respectively, followed by IBM with 6.6 per cent.

The "others" category accounted for a total of 26.8 per cent market
share. This percentage is a significant drop compared to the
consolidated market share of 42.8 per cent in Q1'96.

"The server business is booming, but market figures show the start
of a shake out with the bigger hardware vendors gaining more
dominance," he said. "Historically, the 'others' category accounted
for about 50 per cent of the total market.

"The figures increasingly show that customers are looking for
reliability and quality in the big brand names. Our market share
gain is probably gained at the expense of the other small players,"
he said.

Managing analyst Norman Miranda feels this is true particularly in
the high-end segment where service and support are important.

Although Miranda and Janardan Menon of Dataquest Asia-Pacific agree
on the general trend of a shake out, both believe there are markets
where the small vendors will continue to be a major force.

Meanwhile, No.2 player Hewlett-Packard is investing in two key
areas with the intention of overtaking Compaq as market leader.

The first is to marry its server and networking business, an
approach which Hewlett-Packard admits it should have adopted
earlier.

"We ran the networking and server businesses separately, and
therefore, failed to capitalise on our networking strengths. We
have since realised that, and are now working hand-in-hand to boost
our market offering," said Haslett.

"We're positioning our networking product portfolio as an
additional accessory to the servers."

According to Haslett, HP believes it will be able to emulate its
success in China where it has managed to capture the No.1 spot with
its NetServers, and displace reigning leader Compaq as the leading
player in the Asia-Pacific by next year.

"We're closing the gap between ourselves and Compaq. Our Asia-
Pacific business is growing at a run rate of about US$150 million
annually, and we expect this to double next year," said Haslett.

According to him, Asean is the fastest growing region for HP's
NetServers, led by Indonesia and Singapore with more than 100 per
cent growth.

The second leg of HP's strategy is to attack the low-end PC server
segment with the launch of the HP NetServer E30 optimised for
Windows NT and NetWare.

HP will be shipping early next month a low-end NetServer at PC
price points.

"We should have entered the market with such a product a year ago.
Now that we're launching the E30, we intend to dominate the low-end
area, and expect our units to grow substantially in the next two
quarters," said Haslett.
