<STRONG><H3>Nitron A-35</H3></STRONG>
     "We  knew  Formula A-35 had transformed our Kansas farm  in  1977;
others  had to tell us there was nothing else in the world that  worked
so  well!  The first hint was the awestruck expression on the  face  of
garden  writer Pat Branin when he came to our farm to see for  himself.
He went home to test A-35 in his own soil, then he wrote an article for
the  San  Diego Union that brought the world to our door. We  had  been
sharing  A-35 with friends and neighbors-sending them off with a  fruit
jar or bucket full; but when phones started ringing and we were talking
to growers from around the nation and the world who desper-ately wanted
help  in reclaiming poor soil, there weren't enough fruit jars!"  Frank
and Gay Finger3.

     1The  Invisible Gardeners of America publishes this  book  once  a
year  for  it's use by it's members and the general public.  Commercial
members  are any business providing a service or product that  promotes
environmental  awareness, environmental actions  such  as  the  5  R's:
Reduce,  Re-Use,  Re-Cycle, Re-Think and Re-Plant. Once  you  become  a
commercial member (not all are accepted) we will test your products  in
our organic gardens and then  I will include it in our next book issue.
My  members  trust  my knowledge in this field and have  come  to  look
forward  to the latest edition of this book to see what's new!  I  will
not  write about something that I have not used myself! Visit  our  web
site at http://InvisibleGardener.com
     2Nothing beats organic Alfalfa tea!
     3   I  myself have been using Nitron A-35 since 1978  (I  answered
one  of  their first ads!) and I can tell you there really  is  nothing
like  it!  Nitron A-35 has become a great part of my garden.  I  really
enjoy watching the plants, lawns and earth respond to the A-35!
     4They  make one of the few Urea free fish emulsion on the  market.
This  fish  emulsion,  because  it is fermented,  is  a  very  powerful
fertilizer/  pest controller. The oils in this product  alone  controls
many forms of insects!
