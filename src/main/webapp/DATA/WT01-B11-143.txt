<H2>If Raccoon Rabies is Confirmed in Ontario  
</H2>
</CENTER>

<B>What happens if a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed in Ontario?</B><P>

If a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed in Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources staff will implement a point-control program near the point of discovery, in an effort to contain the disease and prevent it from spreading to the rest of Ontario's raccoons and other mammals.  This would be necessary only if a case occurs outside of treated areas in the Niagara Region and around the bridge border crossings along the St. Lawrence River where raccoons have been vaccinated against raccoon rabies.<P>  

<B>How does a point-control program work?</B><P>

In urban areas, the program involves humanely euthanizing the raccoon and skunk population within a two-kilometre radius of the confirmed case.  Within a further two-kilometre area raccoons and skunks will be vaccinated in order to create a buffer zone of inoculated animals.  In rural areas, all raccoons within a radius of four kilometres will be euthanized, and those within a further four-kilometre radius will be vaccinated.<P> 

The difference in area relates to how far the raccoons are likely to travel within a given period.  Urban raccoons inhabit a much smaller territory than raccoons living in less populated areas.<P>  

<B>Why is it necessary to euthanize some animals?</B><P>

Rabies takes some time to incubate.  Infected animals may not show symptoms of the disease for weeks.  By the time a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed, the disease likely has taken hold in the area and vaccination may no longer be an effective control in the immediate area.<P>

By humanely euthanizing raccoons in the area where a case is confirmed - as they are likely to be infected - and by vaccinating the surrounding raccoon population, the chances of eliminating the disease and preventing it from spreading are increased.<P>

<B>How does the vaccination program work?</B><P>

With the assistance of local trappers hired for their expertise, the Ministry of Natural Resources will set out live-trap cages to catch raccoons without harming them.  Cages are checked within 24 hours and trapped raccoons are vaccinated.  They are also marked with ear-tags so they can be identified as vaccinated and are released at the point of capture.<P>

<B>What role will the public play in this process?</B><P>

The public can follow the same preventive measures that are successful against any strain of rabies.  Vaccinate pets, warn children to stay away from wild or stray animals, and report any animal that behaves strangely to your local humane society, or police department.<P>

If you travel across the region, raccoons are known to "hitch a ride" on trucks and other vehicles.  There is a risk that rabies could be spread far into the province this way.  Before you begin your trip, or after a road-side stop, make sure that you have not "picked up" or are carrying raccoons in your vehicle.<P>
