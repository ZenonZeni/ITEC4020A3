<B>The War against FLEAS</B>.</P>
     Let's talk about the cycles of the flea.  There are three different
types   of  fleas,  the  Cat  Flea  (Ctenocephalides),  The  Dog   Flea
(Ctenocephalides) and The Human Flea (Pulex irritans). The Cat Flea  is
the  one we are most interested in as the other two are very rare.  Cat
Fleas  not  only  like cats, dogs, and humans but they also  like  many
other species such as rats, chickens, etc.
<H1>The Life Cycle of the Cat Flea</H1>
     Adult  fleas lay eggs outside in the grass or any warm safe  place
(usually near a warm blooded host). The eggs develop into legless larva
which  feeds  on tiny amounts of organic matter for up  to  one  month.
Usually  the eggs are laid on the hosts which then drop to the  ground.
If inside they fall on the carpet, etc. The larvae do not bite but live
off  dried blood defecated by the adult fleas. Outdoors the larva  will
lie in a shady moist spot. The larva then becomes a pupae by spinning a
cocoon and emerge in about a week as a hungry adult.
     The  cycle  for reproduction is 30 to 60 days and is triggered  by
the  presence of the host's warmth and the carbon dioxide given  off  by
the host's respiration. The Larvae can live up to 6 months and the pupae
can live to a year until the conditions are right for emergence.
     What  this  means  is  that if you have  just  moved  into  a  new
apartment  or  home  which previously had a dog or cat as a tenant  is  that  your
presence,  or your  cat's  or  dog's could trigger off their  emergence!  Many
people  have allergic reactions to flea bites while others never notice
it.  Fleas  usually do not bite humans unless there are no other  hosts
around.

<H1>Control Methods</H1>
     Your  treatment  should be spread out over a 60 day  period.  This
means that you should do regular flea treatments every month if you are
in  areas  prone  to having fleas. I have two cats and one  dog.  I  know
fleas.  The cats clean themselves and generally don't like to  be  told
what  to do or to have anything done to them, but they can be helped  as
well as the dogs. Fleas and dogs, fleas and cats, they go together.  It's
unnatural  for  there  never to be fleas again. WE  can't  totally  rid
ourselves  of  them any more then we can totally rid ourselves  of  the
ants. The answer here is to control and reduce them. The formulas given
here  along with the hints are to help you keep fleas out of the  house
and off your animals. Follow these hints and you will succeed.
     Many  flea  collars on the market contain Sevin which attacks  the
nervous  system of the insect (as well as your pet's nervous system  and
ours  as  well). I have seen flea collars which contain  DDT!  The
companies are getting smart and are using Pyrethrium but are screwing up
when  they  add Piperonyl butoxide to boost it up. This  product  has
been  associated  with  liver disorders. You should  avoid  using  this
product.  Especially avoid using around children or  seniors  or  those
with  health problems  1. Insist on using only pure pyrethrium flowers (the
whole  plant).  Read  the ingredients. ARBICO, REAL  GOODS,  GARDENER'S
SUPPLY  are  a  few  places you can buy pure Pyrethrium  (see  resources
directory). Also available at many garden centers, etc.,
