<p align="center"><b><u>Major Announcement</u></b><b>: Capricorn
Records To Issue HEMPILATION CD In Fall Supporting NORML And
Protesting Marijuana Prohibition</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Capricorn Records and NORML, the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, are collaborating
to put out a CD album this fall that will be a vocal protest
against the injustice of marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; <i>High
Times</i> Magazine, which covers the music scene in addition to
reporting on marijuana, helped assemble the talent.&nbsp;
Capricorn issued a press release from Nashville announcing the CD
and NORML issued the following statement from Washington. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Statement by NORML</b>:&nbsp; Since even before the days of
Harry Anslinger's aborted plans to arrest jazz musicians in the
1930s, there has been a connection between music, musicians, and marijuana;
however, it has been very hard to find connections between the
music business and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; <u>No
more</u>.&nbsp; Capricorn Records has broken down the closet door
by assembling an extraordinary group of today's hottest bands for
the first-ever benefit CD for NORML.&nbsp; It is appropriately
called HEMPILATION.&nbsp; The bands include the Black Crowes, Blues
Traveler, Cypress Hill, Drivin-N-Cryin, Gov't Mule (featuring
Warren Haynes), 311, Widespread Panic, Ziggy &amp; The Melody
Makers, and others.&nbsp; The artists are contributing &quot;HEMP&quot;
classics or original pieces. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The connection between NORML and Capricorn actually dates back to
the 1970's when Phil Walden, the President of Capricorn, served
on the NORML Board of Directors.&nbsp; When the HEMPILATION was
announced, Walden said he hoped that &quot;this project will not
only be a great source of entertainment, but will also help
spread the word about the many positive actions of NORML and the
benefits of hemp as more than a drug.&quot;&nbsp; Walden made
clear that the HEMPILATION wasn't an endorsement of using
marijuana but rather the belief that the criminal prosecution of
marijuana users was unjust and unfair.&nbsp; This, of course, is
NORML's position.&nbsp; We are not trying to get people to smoke
marijuana, but rather to get the government to stop arresting those
who do.&nbsp; &quot;HEMPILATION is a testament to these bands'
support of NORML's efforts to reform these laws,&quot; Walden
explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The liner notes for the CD will include more information about
hemp and marijuana prohibition and will contain a membership
application for joining NORML.&nbsp; This -- along with the
royalties donated by Capricorn and the artists -- will make an
enormous difference in the ability of NORML to work to end the
arrests of marijuana users.&nbsp; NORML naturally hopes that
everyone who buys the CD will become better informed and more
motivated to get involved in the defense of freedom, whether they
smoke marijuana or not.&nbsp; The HEMPILATION offers a way for
both music lovers and musicians to stand up for freedom. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We also hope that more people in the music business will be moved
by the example of Capricorn and the HEMPILATION artists to
support NORML and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; It takes
courage for a businessman like Phil Walden to take the lead in
supporting NORML, but when others see the public support for
Capricorn and the HEMPILATION, they may find that standing up for
one's beliefs is a very satisfying experience.&nbsp; In fact, the
music business has the power to change America.&nbsp; It remains
to be seen how many other musicians and music industry executives
will be inspired by the example of Walden and the artists on the HEMPILATION
and will come forward. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Almost ten million Americans have been arrested on marijuana
charges since 1965.&nbsp; If the music business really got behind
the marijuana reform movement, these arrests would stop.&nbsp; A
lot of musicians like to sing about pot probably even more like
to smoke it and they may think that this makes them look
&quot;cool.&quot;&nbsp; However, what is really &quot;cool&quot;
is standing up for freedom.&nbsp; Freedom Is NORML. <br>

Capricorn Records, (615) 320-8470.&nbsp; For information on music
industry's support for NORML call Steve Bloom, <i>High Times</i>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Ruling On Student Drug Testing
Expected To Decrease Pot Use And Increase Alcohol And Hard Drug
Use By Students</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 26, Washington, D.C.</b>:&nbsp; Comments
on the Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of
random drug testing of student athletes generally overlook the
fact that such tests do not detect alcohol use and are far less
effective in detecting the use of cocaine and other hard drugs
than marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana metabolites (not the drug itself)
are detectable in urine far longer than residues of cocaine,
etc.&nbsp; This will have the effect of encouraging the use of
hard drugs and alcohol which are far more dangerous than
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his opinion supporting the ruling, Justice Scalia wrote that
the &quot;Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective
expectations of privacy, but only those which society recognizes
as legitimate.&quot;&nbsp; After decades of hate propaganda to
justify arresting millions of marijuana users, the American
people have now been conditioned to believe that forcing someone
to urinate on command does not violate their legitimate&quot;
rights.&nbsp; What the Fourth Amendment <b><i><u>actually</u></i></b>
says:&nbsp; <b>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses and effects against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall Issue, but
upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.&quot;</b>&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson had intended
to put in the part about &quot;only those which society
recognizes as legitimate,&quot; but he forgot.&nbsp; He was
probably suffering from short term memory loss because he grew
hemp at Monticello.&nbsp; We are not going to be drug-free, just
unfree.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Anaheim Repeals Ordinance Barring Former
Drug Offenders From Parks</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 27, Anaheim, CA</b>:&nbsp; In response to
a lawsuit brought by NORML and the Southern California ACLU, the
city of Anaheim has repealed an ordinance that would have kept
persons convicted of marijuana charges out of the city's
parks.&nbsp; A medical marijuana patient convicted of growing
cannabis for his own use would have been barred from attending a
rally in favor of medical access to cannabis had the ordinance
not been enjoined by the courts prior to its repeal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The case was handled by Mark Silverstein of the Los Angeles
office of the ACLU.&nbsp; Mr. Silverstein can be reached at (213)
977-9500.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Announcing</u></b><b>: Compassionate
Oregonians For Medicinal Cannabis</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 15, Portland, OR</b>:&nbsp; Oregon
citizens, frustrated by the Oregon Legislature's failure to address
access to medicinal cannabis and the Federal Government's denial
of the need, have joined to form this not-for-profit
organization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The organization can be reached at: 2600 N.E. Martin Luther King
Blvd., #126, Portland, OR, 97212 or call (503) 288-8816.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Counting Down</u></b><b>: The Ten
Millionth Arrest Since 1965 Will Take Place On July 20</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ten millionth marijuana arrest since 1965
will take place on July 20th, the last day of a prohibitionist
propaganda conference on marijuana sponsored by NIDA (the
National Institute on Drug Abuse).&nbsp; Speakers at the
conference will include such propagandists as Drug Czar Lee Brown
and HHS Secretary Donna Shalala.&nbsp; Their objective will be to
avoid &quot;inhale&quot; jokes and justify another ten million
arrests for marijuana during a heroin, binge alcohol drinking,
and inhalant epidemic.</p>
