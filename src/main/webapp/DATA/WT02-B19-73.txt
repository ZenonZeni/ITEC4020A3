<i><u>Professor W.L. Cleghorn</u></i><p>
     Computer-aided analysis and design of mechanisms considering kinematics and
dynamics.  Areas of application include linkages, gear trains, cams etc. See also <A HREF="cleghorn/main.html">Research and Projects</A>.<p>

<i><u>Professor R.G. Fenton</u></i><p>
     Computer aided design of mechanisms and cams.  Simulation for solving metal cutting
problems.  Kinematic and dynamic simulation of robots.  Computer aided methods to solve
metal flow problems using slip-lines field, principle-lines field and finite element methods. 
Computer aided data collection and management techniques for robot accuracy measurement
determination. Computer aided manufacturing management. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     Off-line simulation and programming of robotic based automation: systems, devices, work cells
and special grippers.<p>

<i><u>Professor S.A. Meguid</u></i><p>
     Probably no development in the history of engineering has had as much effort expended
upon it in such a short time as the application of computers to assist in most design-related
activities.  These activities include:  interactive computer graphics and modelling,
computer-aided analysis, computer-aided draughting and computer-aided manufacturing.  The
purpose of this research program is to bring all these seemingly specialised topics together and
to demonstrate their integration in the design process through practical application to real
engineering problems, such as landing gear assemblies, fluid coupling units and shot-peening
equipment.  For further information refer to the book <i>"Integrated Computer-Aided Design of
Mechanical Systems"</i>  by <i> S.A. Meguid </i>. <p>
     In addition, extensive work is currently being conducted to develop new elements for
treating material and geometrical nonlinearities.  Specifically, contact algorithms using the
variational inequalities method have been developed and applied to a number of engineering
problems, such as gears, dovetail joints in aeroengine discs and interfacial cracking of multi-
layered materials. <p>

<i><u>Professor F.P.J. Rimrott</u></i><p>
     Computational techniques are developed and applied, in particular for problems
involving chaotic behaviour of mechanical systems. <p>


<i><u>Professor L. Shu</u></i><p>
Designers need computer tools not only to manage complex data associated with environmental impact, but also to integrate environmental considerations with traditional design requirements.  

Computer implementation of traditional engineering tools is useful for predicting life-cycle environmental performance of products.  For example, reliability modeling is necessary to predict system failure and part replacement, which directly determines resource consumption and waste generation.

Development of life-cycle frameworks that consider specific aspects of product design, such as material choice or joint design, is helpful for gaining new perspectives on familiar design parameters.  Such frameworks may also result in building design-for-environment knowledge that can be generalized and applied to other aspects of product design.<p>
  
<i><u>Professor R.D. Venter</u></i><p>
     Modern industry requires computer aided engineering tools.  Application of IDEAS
software tools to the design, analysis and simulation of all manufacturing processes and
products.  Particular emphasis is given to the tool, die and mould (TDM) industrial sector
(injection moulding, NC machining).  Theses will usually be linked to an industrial project
requiring solution. <p>
<i> <u>Professor J.W. Zu</u></i><p>
 Computer-aided analysis and design on vibration problems in machinery and structures.  A
complete computer program to fulfill such task is being formed.<p>
