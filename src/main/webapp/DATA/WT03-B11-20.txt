premier research laboratories: Steel Research; and
Advance Materials and Technology Research.  The main
focus of the visits involved titanium,
titanium-aluminide, and carbon-based materials
development at Nippon Steel, all areas in which Nippon
Steel is trying to develop new products and markets.
In particular, Nippon Steel has been somewhat
successful in marketing Ti as a structural and
functional material in new non-aerospace markets such
as construction and consumer goods.  They have also
placed emphasis on the automotive markets, but so far
have met only limited success.  Their penetration into
the high performance aerospace Ti alloys markets has
been very limited.  R&D efforts in new self-lubricating
materials and functionally gradient materials
technologies are also reviewed.

VISIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING AT
THE TOKYO INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

The visitor was given a brief overview (in Sep. 1994)
by Prof. Matsuo.  Following that overview, the visitor
gave a brief seminar on microstructure/property
relationships in gamma TiAl alloys to several members
of the faculty and a handful of graduate students.
Discussions were held with Prof. Takeyama on phase
stability and transformations of several intermetallic
alloy systems, including gamma TiAI.  Since coming to
TIT, Prof. Takeyama has broadened his research to
include microstructure/property effects, with emphasis
on the fixed effect of static heat treatments on
microstructure and properties, while continuing his
research on the effect of ternary additions to the
phase stability of near-gamma alloys.  The majority of
the phase stability work on Ti-A-X systems has been
where X is Cr, Nb, V or Mo.  Of potential commercial
significance is Prof. Takeyama's work on air cooling
and rapid quenching from the single phase alpha region,
followed by tempering or aging.  He has demonstrated
that it is possible to use quench and tempering
treatments to refine the as-cast structure, thus
improving the room temperature strength and ductility
over typical coarse cast microstructures.
