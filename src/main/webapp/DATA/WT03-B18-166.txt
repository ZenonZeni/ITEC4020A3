<P><I>Without any new measures (as considered in the Auto/Oil Programme)<BR>
</I>Using DGXI, UN-ECE and other agreed data sources, the 1990 city emission
inventories were modified to take into account the effects of already-agreed
and adopted legislation, and growth in energy usage and transport. These
modified emissions data were then used as the basis for predicting what
the future air quality would be if no further measures were introduced.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE=-1>Figure2. Future urban air quality
predictions based on European Commission data. The green columns show the
predicted emissions generated within the Auto/Oil Programme. It can be
seen that the measures to reduce NOx, PM10 and ozone coincidentally help
to reduce CO and benzene concentrations to levels even further below the
air quality targets. (London represents more than 80 per cent of European
cities; Athens is worst case).</FONT></TD>

</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The yellow columns in Figures 2 (a, c and d) show the predicted reductions
in NOx, CO and benzene for the year 2010 given already-agreed measures,
for example, the introduction of catalyst cars. It can be seen that the
air quality targets for CO and benzene are met in both London and Athens
before the year 2000 with already-agreed measures. However, it is also
clear that further measures are still required to meet the air quality
targets for NOx and PM10 in 2010.† </P>

<P><I>With proposed Auto/Oil Programme measures</I><B><TT> <BR>
</TT></B>A wide range of different emission reduction measures were carefully
examined and their individual cost-effectiveness calculated and ranked.
Emission reduction measures were selected, first to attain the NOx air
quality target, secondly the PM10 target, and thirdly the ozone target.
It was the ozone target which proved the most difficult challenge and brought
about the selection of the most stringent measures (see following article
for more details on the measures and on ozone). It must be noted that these
predictions of the future assume that the emission reductions achieved
in the transport sector are matched by those from the stationary sector.</P>

<P>Although the outlook for London (i.e. 80 per cent of urban population)
looks favourable, Figures 2a and 2b also show that the stringent air quality
targets are still not met for NOx, PM10 and benzene in the worst case city
(Athens). This is primarily due to the existing traffic problems in Athens
and the very slow turnover in the car fleet. This means that catalyst-equipped
cars will be slow to penetrate the Athens car fleet. Even if all possible
Auto/Oil Programme measures are applied, Athens still would not meet these
air quality targets. A clear outcome from the Auto/Oil Programme was that,
for such special circumstances, the Europe-wide Auto/Oil measures will
need to be supplemented by local measures such as city traffic management
programmes and early vehicle-scrappage schemes. Clearly it would not be
sensible or cost-effective to mandate measures across Europe to try to
solve the local problem in Athens. The Commission’s proposal follows this
line of thinking. </P>

please refer to the Report of Sub-Group 2 published by DGXI entitled <I>Air
Quality Report of the Auto/Oil Programme. </I></P>

<P>† <FONT SIZE=-1>In the case of PM10 suitable models were not available
so emission reduction targets were set without the benefit of modelling.</FONT>
