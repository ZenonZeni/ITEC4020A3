Marijuana causes many mental disorders, including acute toxic psychosis,
panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions, depersonalization, hallucinations,
paranoia, depression, and &quot;uncontrollable feelings of aggression.&quot;
(1) <BR>
<BR>
Increased aggressive behavior after smoking marijuana has been reported
in inner city males. (2) <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana has long been known to trigger attacks of mental illness, such
as bipolar (manic-depressive) psychosis and schizophrenia. It has been shown
that marijuana users are six times more likely to develop schizophrenia
than are non-users. (3) <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana use is associated with the development of Amotivational Syndrome.
(4) <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Often the relationship of impairments and symptoms to marijuana use
becomes evident only when the user is persuaded to stop, shows clear-cut
improvement in mood and behavior, and describes a feeling of coming out
of a fog.&quot; (5) <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana impairs perception, judgment, thinking, memory, and learning.
Memory defects may persist six weeks after last use. (6) <BR>
<BR>
Mental disorders caused by marijuana (cannabis) listed in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV, published by the American
Psychiatric Association May 1994 include: Cannabis Dependence; Cannabis
Abuse; Cannabis Intoxication (impaired motor coordination, anxiety, impaired
judgment, sensation of slowed time, social withdrawal), often includes perceptual
disturbances; Cannabis Intoxication Delerium (memory deficit, disorientation);
Cannabis Induced Psychotic Disorder, Delusions; Cannabis Induced Psychotic
Disorder, Hallucinations; Cannabis Induced Anxiety Disorder; other Cannabis-Related
Disorders. <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana causes both dependence and addiction. &quot;Marijuana is an addictive
drug...Addictive use is defined by compulsive, repeated use in spite of
adverse consequences. Marijuanas effects include tolerance, leading to dependence,
and then inability to cease use.&quot; (7) <BR>
<BR>
In many parts of the country, there are more people admitted to drug treatment
centers because of marijuana addiction than heroin addiction. (8) <BR>
<BR>
A withdrawal syndrome occurs, consisting of &quot;anxiety, depression, sleep
and appetite disturbances, irritability, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea, muscle
convulsions, and restlessness.&quot; (9) <BR>
<BR>
Since marijuana impairs coordination, perception, and judgment, it is the
cause of many accidents. A study of 1023 trauma victims revealed that marijuana
had been used by 34.7%; alcohol had been used by 33.5%.(10) <BR>
<BR>
This is similar to a 36.8% incidence of marijuana use reported in fatally
injured drivers in California.(11) <BR>
<BR>
A study of 182 fatal truck accidents revealed that 12.8% of the drivers
had used marijuana, 12.5% alcohol, 8.5% cocaine, 7.9% stimulants. (12) <BR>
<BR>
A roadside study of reckless drivers not believed to be impaired by alcohol
found that 45% tested positive for marijuana. (13) <BR>
<BR>
The effects of marijuana, which is fat-soluble, persist much longer than
the effects of alcohol, which is water soluble. An experiment on pilots,
using a computerized flight simulator, showed that their ability to land
a plane was still impaired 24 hours after smoking a single marijuana cigarette.
(14) <BR>
<BR>
The use of marijuana during pregnancy is associated with babies of low birth
weight. (15) <BR>
<BR>
Also, there is evidence that such infants will show intellectual impairment
a decade or more later. (16) <BR>
<BR>
Children exposed to marijuana prenatally have increased behavioral problems;
they have decreased visual perception, language comprehension, attention
span and memory. (17) <BR>
<BR>
Babies born to mothers who use marijuana during pregnancy have an eleven-fold
increase in nonlymphoblastic leukemia. (18) <BR>
<BR>
In males, marijuana diminishes testosterone production and lowers sperm
counts. In females, marijuana disrupts hormone cycles. (19) <BR>
<BR>
Studies have shown that marijuana is mutagenic and impairs DNA synthesis.
(20) <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana smoke produces airway injury, acute and chronic bronchitis, lung
inflammation, and decreased pulmonary defenses against infection. Smoking
one marijuana cigarette leads to airway deposition of four times as much
cancer-causing tar as does tobacco smoke. (21) <BR>
<BR>
Recently, there have been cases of cancer reported in young marijuana smokers,
including cancer of the mouth, tongue, larynx, jaw, head, neck, and lungs.
(22) <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana causes impairment of the white blood cells which fight infections.
(23) <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana use decreases resistance to diseases such as herpes. (24)<BR>
<BR>
Marijuana smokers have increased outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses,
accidents, and other illnesses. (25) <BR>
<BR>
The use of marijuana tends to lead to the use of other drugs. 20% of persons
who use marijuana 3-10 times go on to use cocaine; 75% of persons who use
marijuana 100 or more times go on to use cocaine. (26) <BR>
<BR>
Non-marijuana users virtually never become cocaine users. In Alaska, when
marijuana use was decriminalized, use by Alaskan youth of both marijuana
and cocaine became the highest in the nation. The National Survey of High
School Seniors showed that whereas nationally 17% of seniors had used marijuana
in the past month, the Alaskan rate was 45%. The Alaskans then sensibly
recriminalized marijuana use in 1990.
