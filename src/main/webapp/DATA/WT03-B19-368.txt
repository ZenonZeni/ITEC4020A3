<H2>SPH212   Special Relativity </H2><P>
<PRE>
Credit Points:          5<P>
Duration:               Second Semester.<P>
Methodology             1.5L and 0.5T per week.  <P>
Prerequisites:          SPH101 or SPH161, SPH102 (preferred pre: SMA102)<P>
Assessment:             80% Final Exam, 20% Continuous Assessment.<P>
Objectives:             This unit will provide an overview of the 
                        spatial and temporal structure of the Universe 
                        with emphasis upon the properties of the laws of Physics.  <P>
Description:<P>            
The nature of physical law.  The topics covered are the departure from 
Newtonian dynamics, relativistic invariants, perplexities in the 
propagation of light, relativistic kinematics and the Lorentz 
transformations.  The nature of simultaneity and some relativistic 
conundrums such as the twin and pole-barn paradoxes.  Introduction to 
relativistic dynamics and inertia, the relativistic doppler shift, the 
equivalence of gravitational and inertial masses, Etovos experiment.  
Invariance of Maxwell's equations and the origin of the magnetic 
force.  <P>
