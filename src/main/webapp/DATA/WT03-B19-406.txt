<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 214</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The 1985 Villach Conference<BR>
and its follow-up workshops<BR>
on climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>A highly influential scientific conference on climate change was convened in Villach, 
Austria in 1985. </B>On the initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), the 
World Meteorological Organization WMO), and the International Council of Scientific Unions 
(ICSU), scientists from 29 developed and developing countries met from 9-15 October to assess the 
impact of <A HREF = "fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A> such as carbon 
dioxide on the world’s climate. Follow-up workshops were held in 1987 in Villach and in Bellagio, 
Italy. As essentially scientific gatherings, the Villach Conference and the two workshops did not make 
concrete recommendations for a legal approach to climate change. However, drawing on their 
scientific evaluations, they did offer politicians and lawyers some general proposals for action.<P>
<B>The Villach Conference urged further research into both the causes and effects of climate 
change. </B>The conference statement1 presented a consensus view on the current basic scientific 
understanding of the issues. The consensus was that, despite major remaining uncertainties, there was 
sufficient scientific understanding of the climate change phenomenon to justify studies of new 
policies. Long-term monitoring and interpretation of causes and effects of climate change should also 
be undertaken. Research into the impacts of climate change should start immediately, possibly in the 
form of pilot projects in selected regions of the world. Governments and funding agencies should 
support climate research. The statement also recommended that the conclusions of the Villach 
Conference be made widely available, thus contributing to public understanding of the climate change 
issue. Follow-up meetings should be held to continue the work started at the conference and to 
consider the possibility of a climate treaty.<P>
<B>Two workshops were held in 1987 to follow up on the scientific consensus reached at the 
Villach Conference.</B> A science-oriented workshop was held in Villach from 28 September to 2 
October, and a workshop for policy makers was held in Bellagio from 9-13 November. The two 
workshops produced a joint report2 recommending that immediate steps be taken:<P>
	to limit greenhouse gas emissions by promoting implementation of <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol</A> and adopting new energy and 
deforestation policies;<P>
	to limit the impact of <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A> by 
elaborating river and coastal zone policies based on studies of the vulnerability of particular areas; 
and<P>
	to promote understanding of the greenhouse effect through the use of management  tools and 
monitoring and research programmes.<P>
<B>At the Bellagio workshop of 1987, the scientific community offered an early estimate of the 
rate of global warming. </B>The estimate for how much the earth’s surface may warm was based 
on <A HREF = "fs016.html">a doubling of the atmospheric concentration 
of carbon dioxide</A>.<P>
