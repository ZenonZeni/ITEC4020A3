<TITLE>CIS590: Feb 3rd 1994</TITLE>
<H1>CIS590: Feb 3rd 1994</H1>

Guest speakers were decided upon.

Prof. Farber give an overview of the issues surrounding the Clipper
chip, and a syllabus was arrived at:
<UL>
<LI> Technology
<LI> Regulation
<LI> Export Control
<LI> Privacy Law
<LI> Privacy Application
<LI> Cultural Ethics
<LI> Intellectual Property
</UL>

<HR><H2>Technology</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Clipper: what is involved
<LI> RSA and Diffie-Hellman public key systems
     <UL>
     <LI> described more fully in <A HREF="reading.66.txt">the PGP
          documentation</A>.
     </UL>
<LI> DES, the Data Encryption Standard
<LI> Public Domain Systems
<LI> Digital Signature Standard
<LI> Spread Spectrum
     <UL>
     <LI> A signal is broken up and redundantly distributed across
	  certain channels in a spectrum.  A receiving unit can
	  reassemble the message if it knows which channels to listen
	  to.  This isn't exactly encryption but works in the same
	  spirit.  Nontrivial to tap.
     <LI> Used in cordless phone systems, etc.
     </UL>
</UL>

<HR><H2>Regulation of Cryptography</H2>

<UL>
<LI> National (within USA)
     <UL>
     <LI> there may be weak controls during wartime, but there is nothing
	  very strong.
     </UL>
<LI> International (non USA)
     <UL>
     <LI> in France, any use of cryptography is illegal, save whichever
	  schemes are approved by the government, and for which a set of
	  decoding keys are registered with and held by the government.
     </UL>
</UL>

<HR><H2>Export Control</H2>

<UL>
<LI> It is illegal in the USA to export any cryptography technology,
     except some really weak stuff.  [I believe this is under a
     munitions act. -meng]
<LI> also, there are export contorls on high performance electronics:
     the Pentium qualifies as high performance.
<LI> COCOM is a group of largely Western governments agreeing not to
     sell technology to hostile countries.
<LI> <B>Import</B> controls on the other hand are much weaker.  One
     may import stuff which one may not export.
<LI> As a result, USA companies are in a bad situation commercially.
     It makes no sense to create two sets of software, one which may
     be exported, the other for USA use only.
<LI> Export controls are well nigh impossible to implement: consider
     the ease of FTP.
</UL>

<HR><H2>Privacy Law</H2>

There are several overlapping levels and areas in which privacy laws
apply.  Note that in fields as new as this, the law is what courts
decide, not what is written.  Relevant legislation are the Electronic
Communication Privacy Act, and the Electronic Communicaton Mail Act.
The former is worded to send a clear message: government employees
charged under the Act may <B>not</B> use federal funds to help defend
their cases.  This is significant because normally the Justice
Department helps defray costs.  Here, one is left to hang.

<UL>
<LI> Constitutional
<UL>
<LI> Nothing in the Constution mentions the right to privacy.
     <LI> Relevant Amendments, however, do have a bearing:
	  <UL>
	  <LI> First Amendment: the right to free speech would imply
	       that one has also the right to the converse: the right
	       to not be overheard.
	  <LI> Fourth Amendment: illegal search and seizure could
	       conceivably extend to information.
	  <LI> Fifth Amendment: the right not to incriminate oneself.
	  </UL>
     </UL>
<LI> State
<LI> Federal
</UL>

<HR><H2>Privacy Application</H2>

There are a number of distinct places in which different laws and
standards apply.  Three are of interest:

<UL>
<LI> Home.  Maximal privacy is expected.
<LI> Workplace.  Less privacy.  There are two subcases:
     <UL>
     <LI> Real workplaces, in a job setting.  Does the employer have the
	  right to monitor employee communication?  "Common sense" says no,
	  but courts may differ.  The computer is owned by the company.
     <LI> Schools.  Universities, unlike high schools and elementary
	  schools, do not have the right of "loco parentis".  Students are
	  paying customers, and part of what they pay for is an email account.
     </UL>
<LI> Public Spaces.  Very little privacy can be expected.
</UL>

<HR><H2>Cultural Ethics</H2>

Unlike the rapid pace of case law, popular opinion is very slow to
change.  A study of attitudes in American history is relevant.

<HR><H2>Intellectual Property</H2>

What is ownership?  In cyberspace, vessels of value are wholly
intangible.  <A HREF="reading.063.html">John Perry Barlow's article</A>
is very relevant to this issue.

<HR><H2>Miscellaneous Topics</H2>

<H3>Economics</H3>

At least three economic issues are relevant:
<UL>
<LI> Cost to maintain the system
<LI> Cost to install the chip
<LI> Cost of using the system
</UL>
