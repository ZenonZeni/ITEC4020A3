According to the <A HREF="http://www.ncoa.org">National Council on Aging</A>, someone will turn 50 every 7.5 seconds from now until 2014. But what does it mean to be a mid-lifer? What are the options? The possibilities? The realities? Mid-life is a time of dramatic change. Today's mid-life generation is uniquely positioned to experience this time as no generation has before -- they are healthier than their parents were; they have more choices; and they will live longer.

<P>

<I>In the Prime</I> explores being in the prime of life today. Part of a multimedia project from WETA, Washington, D.C., <I>In the Prime</I> is a 26-part, weekly, half-hour television series that can be seen on public television stations nationwide (<A HREF="intheprime_times.html">check local listings</A>). Hosted by veteran journalist Deborah Potter, <I>In the Prime</I> presents personal profiles, commentaries, and studio discussions with experts to address issues such as love, career, family, money, retirement, responsibility, mortality, and the many approaches to a physically and spiritually healthy life.

<P>

The very idea of mid-life is an evolving one. Since 1900, the average life expectancy has grown more than it had in the previous 2,000 years, according to Dr. Robert Butler of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. Not so very long ago, people could well expect to die by the age of 50. Today retirement age is creeping upward. Now instead of retiring at 65, some people are continuing to work; others have set a much earlier retirement goal and leave the work world at 50 or 55 to pursue a dream -- from sailing around the world to returning to school, to moving to a rural setting from a city.

<P>

"Today the mentality of being 50 is more like being 40 was years ago," says Phylis Geller, executive producer of the series, and senior vice president of cultural programming and new media for WETA, Washington, D.C. "It's a whole new environment with so many exciting options. <I>In the Prime</I> is a sort of road map that will present all of the avenues for today's mid-lifers."

<P>

<I>In the Prime</I> introduces viewers to some of the people who have chosen to see the second half of their lives in terms of freedom and opportunity, rather than resignation and regret. Together with guests as varied as comedian Tom Smothers, Sydney Biddle Barrows (the "Mayflower Madam"), poet Judith Viorst, financial adviser John McIntyre, The New Yorker writer Brendan Gill, restaurateur Nora Pouillon, feminist author Letty Cottin Pogrebin, spiritual philosopher Deepak Chopra, and many others, Potter reviews the life choices associated with being over 45.

<P>

"What people are pursuing at mid-life is different from what they pursued in their youth. They often begin to look inward and sense that it's time to shift their focus to more fundamental things," says senior producer Phil O'Connor.

<P>

The series reviews how people assess themselves as they approach mid-life; how they evaluate where they are in terms of their early expectations and how they see their future; how they approach romantic relationships, both old and new; and how they look at nonretirement, divorce, creativity, and work. <I>In the Prime</I> looks at the possibilities for mid-lifers in the current climate of corporate America, at the capacity to learn after a certain age, and at facing serious illness and the alternative treatments to traditional Western medicine, and explores what it means to be a true adult.

<P>

Host Deborah Potter has more than 20 years of experience in broadcast journalism. She served as the Washington correspondent for CNN from 1991 to 1994, and was with CBS News for 13 years as White House, State Department, and congressional correspondent.

<P>

The television series is part of a multimedia project that includes print, online, and video components. <I>In the Prime</I> is a production of WETA, Washington, D.C., with funding provided by Kemper Funds. Executive producer is Phylis Geller; Phil O'Connor is senior producer. Associate producers are Anna Chen and Janice Holland.
