<H2>Introduction to Programs and Units in Chemistry</H2><P>

These pages, formally the printed document "Chemistry at the NTU", 
are intended for current and prospective students in the Faculty 
of Science of the Northern Territory University (NTU) to assist 
them in the selection of courses in Chemistry.  It may also be 
useful to staff of the University and chemists outside the 
University who wish to advise on the development of courses 
in Chemistry.
<P>
Every effort has been made to ensure that the information in 
the document is accurate, but it is not an official University 
document, and if it differs from the official University rules, 
those rules prevail.
<P>
Chemistry staff are responsible for Chemistry courses in the 
following degrees and diplomas:-
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="degree.html">Bachelor of Science</A>
<LI><A HREF="joint.html">Joint Bachelor of Laws/Bachelor of Science</A>
<LI><A HREF="joint.html">Joint Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Economics</A>
<LI><A HREF="diploma.html">Associate Diploma of Applied Science </A>
<LI><A HREF="hondegree.html">Bachelor of Science with Honours </A>

<LI><A HREF="/msc/index.html">Master of Science in Computational Chemistry</A>
<LI><A HREF="higher.html#msc">Doctor of Philosophy</A>
</UL>
<P>
as well as for <A HREF="bridge.html">bridging units in chemistry</A>
for students who wish to proceed to degree level units or otherwise 
require a greater knowledge of chemistry.
<P>
Chemistry courses are the responsibility of the School of 
Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the Faculty of Science.  
On official matters, or if in doubt about the correct channel, 
students should consult the Associate Dean of the School.
Course coordinators are identified at various points in these
pages.
<P>
Chemistry is also taught in the <A HREF="engineer.html">
Bachelor of Engineering</A> degree and the <A HREF="joint.html">
