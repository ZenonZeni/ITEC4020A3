<b>ACCORDING</b> to Victor Marcial-Vega, M.D., the laws of health are inseparable from the laws of Nature. “Once we live according to the laws of Nature, we are never sick and healing occurs effortlessly, in an orderly way.” Dr. Marcial-Vega has seen thousands of cancer patients in the past five years alone and has carried out 2 years of in-depth clinical research on complementary medicine.<p>
The purpose of a cancer cell is to signal the body to get rid of matter in the body that did not replicate normally,” says Dr. Marcial-Vega. “When cancer cells occur—and everyone has abnormal cells arising in their bodies throughout the day—they are readily detected and removed by a healthy immune system.<p>
The immune system helps maintain and revitalize the body by eliminating cancer or otherwise abnormal cells. Only when the immune system weakens can the cancer cells multiply and spread through the body. For Dr. Marcial-Vega, then, the key to successful cancer therapy is strengthening the immune system. “At least 95% of my cancer patients are immunosuppressed due to physical, chemical, mental, and/or environmental causes,” Dr. Marcial-Vega says. “This means if you do not address the immune system, you’re treating the cancer without really treating the cause of the cancer.<p>
Dr. Marcial-Vega has developed a three-pronged strategy for treating cancer: overpower the cancer, strengthen the body, and heal the psyche. In his view, while some patients may need chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery to overpower the cancer, most do not. Dr. Marcial-Vega contends that the latter methods are often “overutilized,” even abused by cancer doctors today. If people use the natural treatments in the early stages of their cancer, they might not have to endure the conventional methods. Unfortunately, many people wait until they have exhausted all those possibilities and are in the advanced stages of cancer before turning to alternatives.<p>
Although most of Dr. Marcial-Vega's patients are in this category, “I have patients who have been cured by the natural treatments only.” He estimates that 5-10% of those who come to him in the advanced stages have cancers reversed by his treatments, and 90% are helped to some degree. <p>

<br><br>

<h4>OVERPOWER THE CANCER</h4>
Dr. Marcial-Vega uses the following treatments which he says “attack” the cancer directly:<p>
<b>Essiac.</b><br>
This 8-herb formula is believed to strengthen the immune system, reduce the toxic side effects of many drugs, in-crease energy levels, and diminish inflammatory pro-cesses, says Dr. Marcial-Vega.<p>
<b>Cartilage.</b><br>
Cartilage (bovine and shark) contains factors that help block the formation of new blood vessels, thereby starving tumors so that they cannot continue to grow.<p>
<b>Enzymes.</b><br>
Enzymes not only digest food, but also help the immune system eliminate cancer cells. It is vital, says Dr. Marcial-Vega, to take the enzymes between meals, on an empty stomach, and preferably not at the same time as Essiac or cartilage. Dr. Marcial-Vega uses Intenzyme Forte (containing pancreatin, bromelain, papain, lipase, amylase, and trypsin) and Retenzyme Forte (with bovine thymus, pea and lentil concentrate, papain, and pancreatin).<p>
<b>Intravenous Vitamin C.</b><br>
Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C can selectively kill tumor cells in a manner similar to other chemotherapy drugs. Research shows that vitamin C boosts Natural Killer (NK) cell activity against cancer cells, and this increased activity is greatest between 8 and 24 hours after ingesting the vitamin C.<p>

<br><br>

<h4>STRENGTHEN THE BODY</h4>
We now have evidence that chemo-therapy, radiation, and surgery flush out vitamins and minerals from the body from day one.,” says Dr. Marcial-Vega.<p>
Without supplements, patients will most likely get sicker from the lack of nutrition needed to protect them from the side effects of conventional treatments. Another reason they feel sick, Dr. Marcial-Vega adds, is the accumulation of cellular debris from the killing of cancer cells. If the body does not eliminate these toxins, a person feels sick, with nausea, flu-like symptoms, achy joints, and headaches.<p>
Herbal and nutritional supplements will support the body’s self-healing ability, detoxification mechanisms, and the removal of toxic substances. <p>
<b>Oral Vitamin C.</b><br>
Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Linus Pauling found that a daily dose of 10 grams of vitamin C significantly extended survival and improved the quality of life in 100 terminal cancer patients. In addition, vitamin C can improve pain control and increase intracellular peroxidases, which are enzymes that help protect cells against harmful free radicals.<p>
<b>Vitamin B complex.</b><br>
Deficiencies of one or more B vitamins tend to impair the immune system’s ability to repel cancer. Both pantothenic acid and vitamin B6 have been shown to inhibit tumor growth. Women with female-related cancers had about 20 times higher life expectancy when taking vitamin B3.<p>
<b>Vitamin E.</b><br>
One of the body’s primary agents for protecting cell membranes, vitamin E is also among the major nutrients required for a strong immune response. One study found that 46% of patients given 400 I.U. of vitamin E twice daily for 24 weeks, had significant clinical improvement.<p>
<b>Selenium.</b><br>
Selenium has potent effects when used with vitamin E. Certain chemotherapeutic drugs, as well as heavy metals (cadmium, lead, and mercury), tend to inactivate selenium, rendering it unavailable to the body. While supplementing, the physician must closely monitor blood levels to avoid selenium toxicity, says Dr. Marcial-Vega.<p>
<b>Coenzyme Q10.</b><br>
This unique antioxidant protects the heart from the adverse effects of chemotherapy and other toxic influences, and has immune-enhancing effects. In one study, coQ10 was given daily to 32 breast cancer patients for 2 years at the dose of 90 mg daily. All patients survived; 6 patients had partial remissions. One of the partial responders then received a high dose of 390 mg daily. This resulted in a complete regression of the tumor within 3 months. <p>
<b>Beta Carotene.</b><br>
A key antioxidant and precursor to vitamin A, beta carotene (a plant pigment) has re-peatedly been shown to enhance the activity of NK cells and other immune cells against tumors.<p>
<b>Green Superfoods.</b><br>
Green vegetable concentrates, such as blue-green algae, spirulina, wheat grass, watercress, or green magma, contain a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, as well as various probiotics, or “friendly” bacteria, that aid in digestion, detoxification, and other key functions.<p>
<b>Multivitamins.</b><br>
These all-purpose supplements ensure that nutritional deficiencies do not develop during cancer treatment and recovery.<p>
<b>Herbal Medicines.</b><br>
To bolster immunity, Dr. Marcial-Vega recommends stinging nettle (Urtica urens), dandelion (Taraxacum officin), plantain (Plantago mayor), and South American rainforest herbs such as Quinchamalium majus and Tristerix tetrandus chilensis.<p>
<b>Willard’s Water.</b><br>
This water helps patients to eliminate toxic chemicals and heavy metals from the body,” says Dr. Marcial-Vega. Willard’s Water’s makers refer to it as catalyst-altered water, based on a “micelle,” comprising tiny electrically charged particles, which changes water’s molecular structure and thereby its properties. <p>

<br><br>

<h4>Heal the Psyche</h4>
The third area of Dr. Marcial-Vega’s approach is psychospiritual healing. In this, he works closely with his colleague, Dr. Andrea Marzouca, Ph.D. The goals of this healing are intangible yet universal:  awareness of self, gratitude and reverence toward the universe, unconditional self-acceptance and realization, self-forgiveness, and taking action and responsibility for oneself. <p>
Basic to the therapeutic process, says Dr. Marcial-Vega, is helping cancer patients learn to see their condition as a signal to reorient their life. When the body is free from chronic distress, it is far more resistant to toxic insults from the environment which can trigger the onset of cancer. In 9 out of 10 cases, says Dr. Marcial-Vega, this stress involves some form of denial, emotional repression, or shutting down of one’s feelings. <p>
It is a grave error, says Dr Marcial-Vega, for doctors to prescribe supplements and other nontoxic strategies without paying attention to the person’s areas of denial or repression. Sometimes it’s helpful to guide the patient through a visualization exercise that helps them experience silence, receptivity, and safety, says Dr. Marcial-Vega. “After this process, patients often decide they are ready to nurture themselves and commit to their healing process.<p>
