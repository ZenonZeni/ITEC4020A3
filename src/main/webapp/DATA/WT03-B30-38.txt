Aegis ships head for Hawaiian CEC experiments

     NORFOLK, Va. -- Aegis guided missile cruisers 
Cape St. George (CG 71) and Anzio (CG 68) are 
underway for Hawaii and the Mountain Top 
experiment that will take place at the end of this 
month.
     Rear Adm. Daniel J. Murphy Jr., commander, 
Eisenhower Battle Group, and commander, Cruiser-
Destroyer Group 8, said the experiment was but a 
gleam in the eye of Vice Chairman, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff Adm. William Owens three years ago.
     The Mountain Top experiment will demonstrate 
the "forward pass" concept, which will use elevated 
sensors and illuminators, set up on a Hawaiian cliff, 
to pass information via the Cooperative Engagement 
Capability (CEC). 
     Hopefully, this will allow an Aegis cruiser to 
launch a Standard Missile toward a low-flying threat 
the ship's sensors can't see, because it is over the 
ship's horizon. The threat will be illuminated from 
the cliff, and the cliff-based sensor will provide a 
guidance update for the ship's missile, to score an 
intercept.  
     CEC is the Navy's program that combines all the 
combat systems and major sensors on ships into a 
single networked battle force system. It is an 
automatic, jam-resistant network, which takes radar 
measurement information from all ships, blending it 
into a composite picture. The same information -- a 
common air picture -- is available on each CEC-
equipped ship.
     Murphy said Patriot and Hawk systems, two 
CEC cruisers, a cruiser without CEC, an E2-C 
aircraft and an Air Force Airborne Warning and 
Control System aircraft will participate in the 
experiment. 
     The test will also look at discriminating through 
the clutter and backscatter radars experience near 
shore, and how to deal with more simultaneous 
threats. 
     Initial operational capability for CEC is 
anticipated in July. After a rigorous 18 months of 
demonstrations and at-sea tests, which include what 
Murphy called, "getting a glimpse of what it [CEC] 
will offer when it is integrated with other systems ...."
     Murphy said "the vision is that the [NATO 
common communications] Link 16 will become the 
universal command and control network, where 
force orders will be sent [and] data exchanged. But 
like any other system, it's only as good as the 
information being put into it."
     CEC, as the principal underpinning of Link 16, 
would standardize all of the information that rides on 
it as the common data link of the future.
     The Air Force is anxious to participate in CEC, 
and is looking at the AWACS platform in particular. 
The Army is still studying what CEC could add to 
its capabilities.
     Murphy said while there's still skepticism about 
CEC, he's "absolutely convinced that 10 years from 
now, there will be no naysayers." 
     CEC buys time, Murphy said, with the 
opportunity to make the right decision. It also 
expands the protected battlespace, and protection is 
essential to project power, he added. "Broadly, CEC 
will ultimately help revolutionize the way all joint 
forces are structured."
     By mid-January, Murphy will be in his new job, 
N86, director, Surface Warfare Div., at the Pentagon.
     While nothing is set in stone as yet, Murphy told 
Navy News he has some ideas about what he wants 
to accomplish in the new job:
     * Emphasize improvements to the warfighting 
architecture to maximize the capabilities of existing 
weapons systems through improved combat 
identification capability.
     * Through technology, including electronic 
controls, move the surface Navy closer to what is 
done in the commercial world -- to trust computers 
to do what people do today. 
     For instance, he said, today ships can have as 
many as 15 people on the bridge when entering port. 
"We have not integrated sensors with alarms and 
controls. My vision is to get to a pilot, copilot 
concept in a ship, like a plane. We've not yet made 
the jump commercial aviation made 40 years ago."

Carderock's minisub race won by Tennessee team

     To take advantage of the holiday season, an 
illustrious group of college students met at the 
Carderock Naval  Surface Warfare Center, Bethesda, 
Md., Dec. 27-30, jumped in the David Taylor model 
basin and raced against the clock -- in muscle-
powered mini submarines. 
     Thirteen teams participated in the race, sponsored 
by the Foundation for Underwater Research and 
Education, the fourth of the biannual events held 
since 1989. This year's meeting was the first under 
the controlled conditions of a basin. 
     The first three races were held in the ocean off the 
coast of Florida. But for the designers, eliminating 
unpredictable side effects such as ocean currents and 
weather makes it easier to concentrate on the main 
job: creating a fast man-powered minisub.
     There was a mind-boggling amount of high-tech 
designed into submarines built by small community 
colleges and even high schools students. Most 
contestants used advanced composite materials, and 
one entry even had an onboard computer to adjust 
the propeller blades to speed and water drag. This 
boat, the OMER from the Ecole de Technologie 
Superieure, Montreal, Canada, won the innovation 
category, but it could not challenge Tennessee 
Technological University's Torpedo III, which 
reached 5.36 knots. 
     Water-lubricated bearings, highly efficient 
transmissions (most often in the style of bicycle 
pedals) and sophisticated shapes to reduce drag are 
standard. So are highly trained athletes who "bike" 
the boats to stunning speeds along the 3,200 foot-
long basin. 
     One boat, the Mermaid of the Annapolis Human-
Powered Submarine Club, composed of engineers at 
the Annapolis facility of the Naval Surface Warfare 
Center, even had to face enemy fire. 
     A metal structure as tall as the boat itself fell on 
the Mermaid before the crew could put it into the 
water for even a single run. The tail fin shattered, but 
it was replaced to log a good run time. Maybe for 
this proof of survivability and maintainability, the 
jury awarded the Mermaid the first prize for the best 
use of composites. 

**The Navy seeks talent

     Carderock's spokesman Tom Warring said the 
numerous inventions had been made coincidentally, 
and the Navy had engineers at the race to look at the 
13 entries from the United States, Canada and 
Mexico. 
     But, as Joel Spencer, the head of the Cape Fear 
Community College, Wilmington, N.C., said, these 
raceboats involve different aspects of submarine 
design than the Navy may want to explore. Noise, 
for example, the quintessential measure of a warship, 
is no factor at all for the race boats. Cape Fear won 
the overall design category.
     But Warring said the Navy was currently doing 
work on manpowered Seal delivery vehicles, and 
there is a chance something new could emerge from 
the studies of the 13 teams.
     John Hussey, one of the volunteers who 
organized the event, said the real advantage for the 
Navy is to get a pool of talented young people, who 
are thinking of making naval engineering a career, 
and show them there is interest in their ideas. 
     "The goal is to form a relationship between bright 
young minds and those who want to tap into those 
minds in the future," Hussey said. 
     Hussey said he knew of the head of the first 
winning team, in 1989, who went on to a remarkable 
career in the Navy. 
     And then there is the public relations coup the 
Navy got as a mentor during the slow news days of 
the Christmas season. 
     The four major Washington local television 
stations had reports on the event, and the Associated 
Press and the New York Times help spread the 
word.
     For information on the sub race series, call Nancy 
Hussey at 410-326-6896.

DoD reduces impact of 'rule of two' decision

     The DoD has proposed expanding contracting 
opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses 
(SDBs) after it suspended the SDB set-aside 
program. 
     In October the DoD suspended its "rule of two" 
set-aside program for SDBs, as part of the 
government's on-going review of all federal race-
based programs. DoD acted in response to the 
Supreme Court's June decision in Adarand v. Pena 
(NN, 10/30/95).
     Proposed new DoD contracting procedures 
include: 
     * expanding the mandatory use of the 10% price 
preference for SDBs to include competitive awards 
based on other than price or price related factors; 
     * considering small, small disadvantaged and 
women-owned small business subcontracting as a 
factor in the evaluation of past performance;
     * requiring prime contractors to notify the 
contracting officer of any substitutions of firms that 
are not small, small disadvantaged or women-owned 
small businesses for the firms listed in the 
subcontracting plan; and 
     * establishing a test program of an SDB 
evaluation preference that would remove bond cost 
differentials between SDBs and other businesses as a 
factor in most source selections for construction 
acquisitions.
     The DoD said the new proposals will 
significantly enhance the opportunities for SDBs to 
participate as key elements of the defense industrial 
base.
     The Justice Dept. continues to coordinate efforts 
to review programs to ensure they are in compliance
with Adarand and the president's July policy 
directive.       Also Justice is continuing efforts to 
reform federal government procurement to meet 
these standards while ensuring that "individuals 
traditionally excluded from business
opportunities have a chance to compete meaningfully 
for government contracts," the DoD said.
     DoD will accept comments on the proposals up 
to Feb. 12. Call 703-602-0350. Refer to DFARS 
Case 95-D039.

Pentagon plans TUAV solicitation this month 

     A full and open competition for the Tactical 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for shipboard and field 
use is expected this month, the DoD reports.
     Paul Kaminski, DoD's undersecretary for 
Acquisition and Technology, directed an Advanced 
Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) 
acquisition approach for the vehicle.  
     Kaminski made his decision last month after 
digesting final staff recommendations for satisfying 
the tactical need for reconnaissance, surveillance and 
targeting at sea or on land. 
     He agreed with the recommendation to procure 
six TUAV systems, each consisting of four air 
vehicles and sensors, plus eight attrition vehicles. 
     The TUAV performance and cost requirements 
were outlined by the Joint Requirements Oversight 
Council (JROC), Dec. 15, in JROC Memorandum 
150-95. 
     The DoD has designated the Joint Program 
Office for UAVs, within the Program Executive 
Office for Cruise Missiles and UAVs, as the lead for 
the TUAV acquisition.
     Contracting support will be provided by Naval 
Air Systems Command.

**Hauls mixed payload

     The air vehicle will have the capacity to carry a 
variety of payloads, including electro-optical and 
infrared imagery sensors, and, if practical, a synthetic 
aperture radar. 
     The vehicle will have a minimum of three hours 
on station at up to 200 kilometers for field and 
shipboard use.  The TUAV requirements also 
include electromagnetic interference shielding and 
anti-corrosion features.  
     If offerors do not provide automatic takeoff and 
landing and a heavy fuel engine, or HFE, as part of 
the basic system, options for development and 
integration of those capabilities into the TUAV will 
be requested by the government, the DoD said. 
     Development of a common ground reception, 
processing, and control system, providing for or 
leading to compatibility with other UAVs, collection 
systems, and command, control, communications, 
computers, intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance systems, is also a program 
requirement.  
     Another UAV system, the Hunter has been 
blasted by some admirals and the General 
Accounting Office. They agree the Hunter does not 
satisfy shipboard and naval operational requirements 
(NN, 12/11/95).

GAO: Navy clipped AF's wings through faulty stats

     The Navy used statistics at its own pleasure and 
advantage when it cut the Air Force out of an F-18 
maintenance deal, the General Accounting Office 
says.
     In an effort to minimize maintenance costs for its 
F-18 fleet, the Navy subjected the depot work to a 
competition. Four contenders emerged; two private 
firms, the Ogden (Utah) Air Logistics Center and the 
Naval Aviation Depot, North Island, San Diego. 
     In a first competition, Ogden won on cost and 
began to perform the Modification, Corrosion and 
Paint Program (MCAPP) in 1993, the year of the 
competition. But the Navy immediately informed the 
Air Force the sea service intended to maintain a core 
capability in-house, and Ogden would only get the 
minimum number of aircraft specified in the 
competition documents. 
     Core capability requirements are a common 
argument in the privatization debate between the 
Defense Dept. and private contractors. The issues 
involve the availability of private workers in war 
areas and their reliability due to labor conflicts that 
cannot rock the military. Such arguments seemed not 
to play a role in interservice competition.
     Core capability generally goes beyond service 
requirements. "However," GAO admits, "in practice 
it appears each service will be allowed to define a 
core capability requirement for its own essential 
systems and equipment ... ."
     In September 1994, a year after the initial 
competition, the Navy determined in a bid for 
additional work that North Station could perform the 
MCAPP faster and cheaper than Ogden. Thus the 
Navy decided not to exercise an option for an 
additional year of work at Ogden, and consolidated 
the work in California.
     Consolidation, the GAO says, is more cost-
effective than splitting the work between two 
contractors. But , if the Navy knew it wanted an in-
house capability and could therefore not consolidate 
at any other place, why launch  a competition in the 
first place?
     According to the Navy, quality of work was 
comparable at Navy and Air Force depots. The 
reason for the award to North Station was the faster 
turn-around time. If an aircraft takes less time in the 
maintenance pipeline, fewer planes are needed to 
meet the readiness requirements.
     But the Air Force contends that the delays 
experienced in the period used by the Navy to make 
its decision were caused by the Navy itself. Late 
funding delayed start-up and replacement parts 
(which under the contract the Navy was to provide) 
arrived behind schedule. Additionally approval of 
work wasn't on time.

**The ghost of the A-12 lawsuit

     Such Navy activity is reminiscent of why a 
federal judge ruled last year that the Navy had to 
reimburse contractors for the terminated A-12 
bomber development contract (NN, 12/25/95).
     The Navy, the GAO furthermore concludes, 
compared apples and oranges when it used data for 
ground-based F-18 and compared them to carrier-
based ones, and looked at different stages on the 
learning curve in comparing cost at North Station 
and Ogden. Accounting for these methodological 
flaws, Ogden would have come out the slightly 
cheaper place for the MCAPP, the GAO says.

**DoD guidance required

     The GAO conclusion can be read as an absolution 
of the Navy as well as an indictment. "We 
recommend that the secretary of Defense develop 
and implement guidance on using merit-based 
selection procedures when moving depot workload," 
the GAO says, thus putting the onus of change on 
the secretary.
     On the other hand, in an era where "fewer 
regulation" has become the dominant buzzword, 
requesting more DoD regulations also implies that 
the Navy is not capable of finding reasonable and 
cost-saving ways to handle its maintenance work, the 
GAO adds.
     The F-18 maintenance work continues today at 
North Station.
     Fax 301-258-4066 for the GAO report: "Depot 
Maintenance: The Navy's Decision to Stop F/A-18 
Repairs at Ogden Air Logistics Center" (NSIAD 96-
31).

Marines buy latest addition to LAV family

      The Marine Corps has bought the newest variant 
of their Light Armored Vehicles (LAV), an air 
defense version of an established family of armored 
vehicles.
     The Corps ordered 17 of the vehicles designed to 
defend against air attacks, but also capable of fighting 
ground threats. The cost is $70 million, including the 
operational support tab. 
     The LAV-AD (for air defense) features eight 
Stinger missiles distributed over two launch sets and 
a 25 mm gun.

**System has added fire power

      Including the eight extra missiles stored onboard 
and the large amount of ammunition for the gun 
(385 rounds in the gun magazine plus 605 extra), the 
vehicle has enough firepower for 44 engagements, 
its manufacturer Lockheed Martin says. 
     The Navy's "Forward ... From the Sea" strategy 
calls for rapid deployment and sustainment of 
ground forces from the sea. The LAV family meets 
these requirements, the Marines contend. 
     The craft features self-protection technology 
against  nuclear, biological and chemical attack and 
laser-protected windows. Its data links allow instant 
communication with other units or other services 
through satellite hook-ups. 
     For rapid deployment, the 29,000-pound vehicle 
can be airlifted by C-130 transports or CH-53 
helicopters. Tests, which began in 1991, show its 
good surface mobility and the ability to fire on the 
move. 
     Since the beginning of the test and evaluation 
phase, 54,000 rounds of ammunition and 26 live 
Stingers have been fired, and tests in extreme heat 
and cold conducted, Ron Gagne, a Lockheed Martin 
executive in the Burlington, Vt., facility told Navy 
News. 
     The order of 17 represents four groups of four, 
plus an extra vehicle. Gagne said the initial 
requirement was higher, but the changes in force 
structure impacted the Marine Corps LAV fleet.

Northrop Grumman grows via Westinghouse

     Defense giant Northrop Grumman bought 
Westinghouse's Defense Electronics Div. offered for 
sale last year.
     Northrop Grumman, itself created through a 
merger in May 1994, managed to obtain sufficient 
credit from different banks to close the $3 billion 
deal, the Los Angeles-based company announced 
Jan. 3.
     Northrop Grumman is involved in fighter and 
surveillance aircraft, electronics and systems 
integration, precision weapon systems and 
information technology.
     Westinghouse has a strong naval business, 
making radars, surveillance technology, anti-
submarine gear, torpedoes and anti-torpedo systems 
and other electronics for underwater applications. 
     One major naval program will stay with 
Westinghouse for the time being: the submarine 
auxiliary propulsion, developed and produced in the 
Pittsburgh Science and Technology Center. A part of 
the center is moving to NG, but the sub engines are 
not, an official said. 
     The new company's sales could top $10 billion by 
the end of the decade, said NG's CEO Kent Kresa. 
Northrop Grumman's sales in 1995 reached $6.8 
billion; Westinghouse's $2.6 billion.
     Northrop Grumman was not a top pick when 
analysts and defense experts put their heads together 
after the announcement that Westinghouse would go 
on the block. 
     Despite synergies in the electronics between 
Westinghouse's and NG's business, the acquisition 
broadens NG's business. Particularly in the 
underwater area, Westinghouse will add 
considerably to NG's current product line. That is a 
deviation from the industry trend to consolidate 
around a narrowly defined core business and drop 
other areas.
     Some expect that Northrop Grumman will soon 
look for buyers of these areas outside its own core 
business. 
     By contrast, NG raised bank commitments of 
$4.8 billion, in excess of the purchase price and the 
financial commitments the buyer assumed for 
employee benefits. These are estimated at $600 
million. 
     In addition, Kresa noted NG had succeeded in 
reducing its overall debt by $200 million more than 
expected in 1995, to $1.6 billion.
     All the financial data indicate NG may as well try 
to break out of the trend and enlarge its defense 
business base.

     World War II hero Adm. Arleigh Burke, 94, for 
whom the Burke-class of destroyers are named, died 
of pneumonia, Jan. 1, at Bethesda (Md.) National 
Hospital.   
     Nicknamed "31-knot Burke" for his combat 
tactics during the war, he later served an unequaled 
three terms as chief of naval operations and retired in 
1961. 
     He went on to help create the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies at Georgetown University. 
He served as the center's director for 15 years.
     A 4.5-foot black granite monument will mark his 
grave at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md.

No-nuke zone worries Navy

     The Assn. of South-East Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) and the observer states of Cambodia, 
Myanmar and Burma decided last year to declare 
their territorial waters nuclear weapon- free. 
     The Navy fears that will limit its ability to pass 
through the area with nuclear weapons onboard 
surface ships and submarines.
     ASEAN includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and 
Brunei. 
     The territorial waters of Indonesia and the 
Philippines block the entire Pacific between the 
Asian and the Australian continent. 
     Indonesia alone would stretch from Seattle to the 
Bahamas, if superimposed over the map of the 
United States.

Base Closure Commission closes doors

     The Base Realignment and Closure Commission, 
feared by base commanders for years under the 
acronym BRAC, closed at the end of 1995. 
     BRAC was set up to reduce the number of 
military bases at a time when force levels decreased 
rapidly and the Pentagon had to shed excess 
overhead cost.
     Some in Congress predict a return of BRAC. 
Senate Armed Services ranking minority member 
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., says the military needs to close 
more bases if it wants to have money for 
modernization.

UAE visits French shipyard

     The vice chief of naval operations of the United 
Arab Emirates' navy visited shipyards of the French 
national shipmaker DCN in December.
     The UAE wants to buy frigates, and the French 
are very strong in the export business. 
     Last year, Newport News won overhaul contracts 
in its new facilities in the UAE (NN, 3/27/95). 
Newport News hopes these facilities will give the 
yard the edge in ship sales. No visit to Virginia by 
Emirati navy officials is planned, but spokeswoman 
Jerri Fuller Dickseski said there have been visits in 
the past.

Communications System," said Michael T. Smith, 
Hughes Aircraft chairman and Hughes Electronics 
vice president.
     "This acquisition will enhance our leadership in 
military communications," he added. "The 
combination of technologies and manufacturing 
processes of the two companies should also result in 
an expanded array of capabilities that Hughes
