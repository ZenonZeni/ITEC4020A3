</H3><P>	




<P><B>	The Made in the USA Foundation represents 60,000 Americans who want

to buy American-made products, as well as manufactures of those products

and labor unions whose workers make products here.  The Made in the USA label

is an important marketing tool in the United States and overseas and we want

that label to mean something.  We want it to mean the same thing across the




country, from agency to agency and around the world.</B>




<P><B>	My name is Joel Joseph.  In addition to serving as Chairman of the




Foundation, I am a lawyer and an economist.	There are many deceptive practices




being used by companies trying to appear to be U.S. manufacturers.  The U.S.

Lock Company, for example, does not make locks in the United States.  FloridaGold




orange juice may come from Brazil:  The label states that the product conducts




orange juice from Florida and/or Brazil.  But what is it?  Florida juice

or Brazilian juice?  American consumers, and consumers from around the world,




have the right to know.</B>




<P><B>	The European Commission recently proposed that certain food products

were so closely associated with geographical locations that the names would

be protected and no one outside of that nation or region could use the name.




</B>




<P><B>Just last month the European Commission proposed 318 protected names




including:  Prosciutto di Parma (Italy), Roquefort cheese (France), Fontina




cheese (Italy), Stilton cheese (England), Newcastle Brown Ale (England) and

Feta cheese (Greece).  The European Commission stated that it is unfair




competition for producers outside of these regions to use geographical names




associated with particular products.  We at the Made in the USA Foundation




wholeheartedly agree.</B>




<P><B>	We similarly don't want Florida orange juice to come from any other

place.  We want Idaho potatoes from Idaho, Long Island duckling from Long

Island and Vermont maple syrup from Vermont.   Maple Grove Farms of Vermont

sells maple syrup that may be from Vermont or maybe from Canada. The label

is clearly deceptive.  </B>




<P><B>	There is a case pending before the courts in the United States about

Swiss Army knives that are made in China.  I don't believe that the Swiss

Army has ever left that country, and most certainly never made it to China.

 Most Americans would assume that a Swiss Army knife was made in Switzerland.




</B>




<P><B>Switzerland is known for its skill in making precision instruments.

 The Made in the USA Foundation supports the Swiss manufacturer in its claim

that Swiss Army knives can only be made in Switzerland. </B>




<P><B>	Similarly, Americans and others would assume that Milwaukee tools

are made in Milwaukee, that Virginia hams come from Virginia and that Rockport




shoes come from Rockport.  Milwaukee tools are indeed made in Wisconsin and




Virginia pigs are the source of Virginia hams, but Rockport shoes are made




elsewhere.  Similarly L.A. Gear shoes are not made in Los Angeles, although

most consumers would believe that L.A. Gear products are made in Southern




California.  American cities, states and regions deserve the same respect

as those in Europe--if a manufacturer wants to use an American geographical

name it must manufacture the product here.</B>




<P><B> 	The liquor industry has protected regional product names for many

years.  Scotch whiskey can only come from Scotland and Bourbon can only be

made in Kentucky.  </B>




<P><B>	Turning to clothing, many manufacturers virtually wrap themselves

in the American flag, which they have imported from the Pacific rim.  Perry

Ellis flaunts his "America Series" of imported clothing.  If something is

called "American," then it should come from America.  And if not, the label




should certainly state in large letters, as large as the reference to America,




that the product is made elsewhere.  Tommy Hilfiger similarly promotes his




American style clothing, but few know that his "American" products are




imported.</B>




<P><B>	Perry Ellis and Tommy Hilfiger often use the American flag in their




designs.  Use of the American flag conveys the message that the product is




American-made.  But often, if the shopper notices the microscopic country

of origin label, he or she may notice that the product is an import.  Like

a geographic reference, use of an American flag denotes country of origin.</B>




<P><B>	How about American flags themselves?  In 1994, 850,000 U.S. flags

were imported, mostly from Taiwan and China.  In your recommendations to

Congress the Foundation proposes that the importation of American flags be




prohibited.  Similarly, clothing and other articles which include an American




flag, such as pins, buttons, hats and so forth, should be included in the




prohibition.  I challenge any Member of Congress to vote against this




proposal.</B>




<P><B>	When a product uses the name American it implies manufacture in this




country.  "American Classic" shoes, especially when dressed up in red and

white stripes and white stars on a blue background, shouts out: "Made in

the USA."  But quietly such products whisper in 6 point type: "Made in China."




</B>




<P><B>This is clearly a deceptive country of origin marking.  In fact, I

cannot conceive of a more deceptive label or package.</B>




<P><B>	What does made in the USA mean?  Before the Federal Trade Commission

we proposed that Made in the USA means 75% U.S. content (parts and labor




together) on a cost of goods sold basis with final assembly in the United

States.  A lesser standard of 50% was proposed for the label "Assembled in

the USA."</B>




<P><B>	The Foundation also believes that "Made in Italy" or "Made in Japan"




should meet those same high standards.  Now, I understand that shoes can

carry the "Made in Italy" label when the uppers are made in Romania and the

soles come from Taiwan.  Only the final assembly was done in Italy.  This

is blatantly unfair to American consumers and competitors.  "Made in Italy"

on a pair of shoes means quality to many consumers.  A fair label for these




hypothetical shoes may be "Uppers Made in Romania, Soles Made in Taiwan,

Final Assembly in Italy."</B>




<P><B>	Similarly, a VCR can now carry a "Made in Japan" label that was only




assembled in that country.  For example, all of the parts may have come from




Taiwan (40%), Malaysia (30%) and Hong Kong (15%).  If that is the case the

label should fairly read: "Components made in Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong,




Final Assembly in Japan."  The order on the label should be in descending

order of where most of the content came from.</B>




<P><B>	Computers are truly an international product.  No computer that I

am aware of comes 100% from any one country.  This is one type of product

that should have a more precise label.  In the United States, the Foundation




proposed similar requirements for automobile labeling which (with one amendment)




became the American Automobile Labeling Act.  Every new car sold in the United




States is required to include a label which states the U.S. and Canadian

content, where the engine was made, where the transmission was made and where




final assembly took place.  </B>




<P><B>	The Foundation proposes that computers be labeled as follows:</B>




<P><B>		1.  Country with most content: _____%  (e.g. Japanese Content X%

or U.S. Content X%)</B>




<P><B>		2.  Monitor made in ______________.</B>




<P><B>		3.  Mouse made in _______________.</B>




<P><B>		4.  Keyboard made in ____________.</B>




<P><B>		5.  Central Processing Unit made in ___________.</B>




<P><B>		6.  Final assembly in _______________________.</B>




<P><B>	In summary, the Made in the USA Foundation wants consumers to be informed




accurately about the country of origin.  Information necessary for simple

items is different than that needed for a car or a computer.  And the label




should be accessible.  To the dismay of many store employees,  I have turned

VCRs and computers upside down to find a country of origin label. </B>




<P><B>These labels should be on the front of the product or on the price

sticker.  No label should leave any doubt.  Don't allow manufacturers or




importers to say: "may contain contents from the following countries."  This

is not a country of origin label--it is per se an unfair and deceptive practice




that is rampant. </B>




<P><B>&nbsp;I would like to thank the Commission for providing me with




anopportunity to present the views of the Made in the USA Foundation.</B>
