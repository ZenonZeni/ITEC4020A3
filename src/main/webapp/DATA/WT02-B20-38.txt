  This paper reviews literature on the adult outcomes for children diagnosed  with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).  It critiques  methodological issues, including diagnostic definitions, research designs,  sample characteristics, and assessment instruments.  It examines the  relationship of AD/HD to a variety of adult disorders and pathology, including:  (1) impaired lifestyle functioning (continuance of AD/HD symptomology and  educational or occupational problems); (2) substance abuse (alcohol and drugs);  (3) social pathology (antisocial behavior, criminality, and pathological  gambling); and (4) psychiatric symptoms (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and  antisocial personality disorder).  The paper concludes that some individuals  diagnosed with AD/HD in childhood continue to experience the full or partial  syndrome in adulthood, tend to have lower educational and occupational status,  have an increased risk for alcohol and substance abuse, and appear to be at  greater risk for psychopathology.  In particular, there seems to be a link  between AD/HD in childhood and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood.   (Contains 49 references.)<BR>

  This paper reviews the assessment and diagnosis of attention  deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults.  To provide baseline  information, consideration is given to outcome studies for adults who were  first diagnosed with ADHD as children.  Studies of clinical assessment methods  are addressed, and previous diagnostic criteria are compared to current  criteria.  Also considered is the area of retrospective childhood diagnosis.   The retrospective approach of reviewing childhood symptoms was found to provide  moderate agreement between parental and subject recollections of childhood  behavior; however, there may be a tendency for subjects to under-report their  symptoms compared to parents.  Presence of co-morbid disorders such as learning  disabilities has confounded much of the clinical assessment of symptomotology.   Tests which have been used to differentiate children with ADHD and those with  learning disabilities are examined, as are the use of neuropsychological tests  in adults.  It is concluded that the lack of consensus in the existing  literature suggests that a multimodal method of assessment appears necessary at  this time.  (Contains 39 references.) (SW)<BR>

  Describes and distinguishes between symptoms of Attention Deficit Disorder 
without (ADD) and with hyperactivity (ADHD).  Notes that confusion exists in 
distinguishing between problems related to ADD and ADHD and problems related to 
other causes.  A fictitious case study demonstrates problems of families with 
children with ADD and ADHD.  A multimodal treatment of the child and family is 
described.  (TM)<BR>

  This resource guide is designed to help adults who suspect they have a 
learning disability gather sufficient information to set realistic goals, 
achieve those goals, and lead productive lives.  The first section, which 
discusses assessing learning disabilities, includes lists of agencies equipped 
to help diagnose learning disabilities in adults and questions to ask qualified 
professionals.  A checklist of 28 identified characteristics of adults with 
learning disabilities is presented along with annotated lists of 13 national 
resource centers, 9 organizations concerned with general education, 8 learning 
disability organizations, 3 attention deficit disorder organizations, 4 
organizations concerned with employment issues, 5 organizations concerned with 
technology, 16 organizations concerned with life management issues, and 20 
publications of relevance to learning-disabled adults.  A list of 16 pertinent 
toll-free numbers and information on the HEATH Resource Center and National 
Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities Center conclude the guide.  (MN)<BR>

  Clinical research has established a connection between childhood trauma and 
the development of dissociative disorders in adults.  Pathological dissociation 
produces a range of symptoms and behaviors such as amnesias, rapid shifts in 
mood and behavior, and auditory and visual hallucinations.  Many of these 
symptoms are misdiagnosed as attention, learning, or conduct problems, or even 
psychoses.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This pamphlet explains briefly what is known about attention deficit 
disorders (ADD), to help parents and educators have a more positive influence 
on the ADD child's life.  It begins with definitions of terminology; 
characteristics of preschool, school-age, and adult individuals with ADD; and 
causes of ADD.  It discusses special problems associated with ADD, including 
academic problems, behavior difficulties, interpersonal difficulties, and self-esteem difficulties.  Strategies effective in managing ADD are outlined, 
including medical management, behavioral strategies, cognitive-behavioral 
therapy, modifications in assignments and tests, and instruction in learning 
strategies.  The pamphlet concludes that with appropriate management and 
treatment during the formative years, the individual with ADD can live a normal 
and productive life, and that it behooves educators to realize the important 
facilitative roles they serve in the overall treatment plan of children and 
adolescents with ADD.  The pamphlet concludes with a list of 14 resources for 
educators, 8 resources for students, 9 resources for parents, and 8 parent 
support groups and organizations.  (Contains 23 references.) (JDD)<BR>
