This document reports on efforts to find technology-based solutions for the 
diverse challenges faced by students with disabling conditions.  Twenty-three 
case studies describe actual scenarios experienced in the school district of 
Palm Beach County, Florida.  For each case study, a situation is described, a 
challenge is identified, solutions are considered, an assessment is made to 
select the most appropriate system, and expenditures for the selected system 
are determined.  The case studies deal with students with the following 
disabilities: arthrogryposis, cancer, cerebral palsy, educable mentally 
handicapped, emotionally disabled, gifted learning disabled, hearing impaired, 
muscular dystrophy, near drowning, post encephalitic generalized dystonia, 
stroke, traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, and visually 
impaired.  Twelve vignettes are then presented, describing school situations 
that involve the use of assistive technology and challenging the reader to 
develop strategies to solve the problems described.  A list of vendors is 
supplied, and school district procedures for placement of adaptive/assistive 
equipment for students with disabilities are included.  (JDD)<BR>

This informational digest considers assistive technology for students with 
mild disabilities in the context of Public Law 100-407, the Technology-Related 
Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988 which was designed to 
enhance the availability and quality of assistive technology devices and 
services to people with disabilities and their families.  First, assistive 
technology devices are briefly described.  Then seven areas in which assistive 
technology can assist students with mild disabilities are explained with 
examples.  These are: (1) organization, (2) note taking, (3) writing 
assistance, (4) productivity, (5) access to reference materials, (6) cognitive 
assistance, and (7) materials modification.  Contains three references and 
three suggested resources, and includes electronic resources.  (DB)<BR>

New computer software, developed to advance technological applications, may 
inadvertently reduce computer access of disabled users.  Increasing graphical 
applications not usable by blind persons are creating concern.  Advocates for 
persons with disabilities are urging software developers to alter existing

This paper describes programs and resources that focus on access of 
postsecondary students with disabilities to computers and other forms of 
technology.  Increased access to technological devices and services is provided 
to students with disabilities under the Technology-Related Assistance for 
Individuals with Disabilities Act (Tech Act).  Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act as amended by P.L.  99-506, may also have an impact as it 
requires that electronic office equipment used by the federal government be 
usable by persons with disabilities and may increase accessibility in other 
markets as well.  Special programs have been developed at several colleges and 
universities to provide computer access for individuals with disabilities.  
These programs train students in use of large print terminals, adaptive 
keyboards, computerized braillers, talking computers, and other aids to 
independence.  Seven publications that discuss financial support for purchasing 
adaptive technology are described, along with two organizations offering 
financial support.  Several resources that assist with accessing computer 
technology are also described, such as the inLarge screen enlarging program, 
the SpeechViewer II software and accessories package, the IBM PC User Group, 
the Unicorn Smart Keyboard, and a journal titled "Technology and Disability."

This outline sets forth assistive technology rights of students under the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Carl D. Perkins 
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990, Section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act, and the 
regulations implementing these statutes.  The paper defines "assistive 
technology device" and "assistive technology service," outlines 
responsibilities of states receiving IDEA funds to provide such devices and 
services, notes eligibility requirements, examines requirements for vocational 
education programs, considers the use of assistive technology devices and 
services to enable placement in regular education settings, discusses the 
provision of auxiliary aids to students in postsecondary education programs, 
reviews the scope of the term "auxiliary aids and services," and points out 
that individuals with disabilities in public and private schools must be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in or benefit from an aid or service 
equal to that afforded others.  References to the United States Code, the Code 
of Federal Regulations, and court cases are provided to support the paper's 
views.  (JDD)<BR>

This report documents activities and projects from 1987 to 1994 of the Trace 
Research and Development Center (Wisconsin), which addresses the communication 
needs of nonvocal severely disabled children and adults.  During this period 
the Center also served as a national Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center 
on the topic of Access to Computers and Electronic Devices.  Introductory 
information includes an overview of the Center and a description of recently 
released products.  The main body of the document presents 41 individual 
project reports.  These are grouped into the following focus areas (with sample 
projects noted in parentheses): (1) movement impairment (development of 
improved headpointing computer access system); (2) sensory impairment (tactile 
perception and business graphics studies); (3) cognitive impairment (interface 
training and use by persons with cognitive disabilities); (4) cross-impairment 
(computer and operating system accessibility design guidelines); (5) 
information and training programs (databases on communication, control and 
computer access development and downloading); and (6) service delivery programs 
(communication aids and systems clinic).  Two additional sections describe 
cooperative and consultative efforts of the Center and list Trace Center 
publications.  (DB)<BR>

Through technology, students with disabilities are identifying new options 
for participation, exerting more control, making more choices, and interacting 
more effectively.  Inclusion, as a policy and as a practice, is reducing the 
physical and social isolation encountered by individuals and families, 
broadening expectations, reducing limits, and expanding choices.  Technology 
and inclusion go hand in hand.  Without technology supports and accommodations, 
many students cannot take full advantage of education.  Without the 
opportunities for interaction found in inclusive settings, students cannot 
truly demonstrate their abilities.  The following areas should be analyzed to 
determine whether technology support has the potential to facilitate the 
child's participation: (1) transportation to and from school and related 
events; (2) physical access; (3) classroom/library equipment and modifications; 
(4) shop/vocational education; (5) lunchroom; (6) playground/gym; (7) 
evaluation/assessment; (8) curriculum; (9) Individualized Education Program or 
Individualized Family Service Plan; (10) training; and (11) planning and policy.
Several questions to consider in analyzing each area are listed.  (JDD)<BR>
