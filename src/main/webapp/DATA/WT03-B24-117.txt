   *Comments* on Draft Criteria for Software Key Escrow
   Exportability

   Dorothy E. Denning

   Sept. 5, 1995


   1.   The product will use an unclassified encryption
        algorithm (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to
        exceed 64 bits. [No comment]

   2.   The product shall be designed to prevent multiple
        encryption (e.g., triple-DES). [No comment]

   3.   The key required to decrypt each message or file shall
        be accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the
        product, and such keys will be escrowed during
        manufacture in accordance with #10. If such keys are
        not escrowed during manufacture, the product shall be
        inoperable until the key is escrowed in accordance
        with #10.

        *Comment. The requirement as written suggests a
        Clipper-like model where each product has its own
        individual escrowed key. With some key escrow systems,
        for example, TIS's CKE and Fortress's KISS, the keys
        held in escrow are master keys shared by multiple
        products/users. A product encrypts the session/file
        key (or, in the case of KISS, the user's private key)
        under this master key. The master key could be
        pre-loaded into the product (e.g, as with KISS) or it
        could be downloaded into the product during program
        initialization (e.g., TIS). Further, we do not want to
        prevent a product from operating at all prior to
        escrow. As with the TIS or Banker's Trust (BT)
        proposals, the product needs to operate in order to be
        initialized with keys! All that's needed is to prevent
        data encryption. Finally, the requirement as written
        does not make it clear that the product in question is
        the one that was used to encrypt the data (which,
        strictly speaking, may be something other than a
        message or file, e.g, an image object). The following
        is a possible rewrite:

          The key required to decrypt data that has been
          encrypted by a product shall be accessible through
          a key escrow mechanism in the product. A product
          shall not encrypt data unless the key needed for
          decryption has been escrowed in accordance with
          #10.*

   4.   The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include
        with each encrypted message or file, in a format
        accessible by authorized entities, the identity of the
        key escrow agent(s), and information sufficient for
        the escrow agent(s) to identify the key or key
        components required to decrypt that message.

        *Comment. It is not necessary to identify the escrow
        agents as long as there is information that will
        readily lead to their identity. For example, the BT
        proposal identifies the user and the user's escrow
        center. The escrow center has a record of the escrow
        agents used by that user. As another possibility, a
        product might be designed to always use a particular
        escrow agent(s), so knowing the name of the product
        would be sufficient to identify the agents (as in the
        case of Clipper). Possible rewrite:

          The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to
          include with each encrypted message or file, in a
          format accessible by authorized entities,
          information that readily leads to the identity of
          the key escrow agent(s), and information sufficient
          for the escrow agent(s) to identify the key or key
          components required to decrypt that message.*

   5.   The product shall be resistant to any alteration that
        would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism,
        to include being designed so that the key escrow
        mechanism cannot be disabled by a static patch, (i.e.,
        the replacement of a block of code by a modified
        block).

        *Comment. The product should also be resistant to
        circumvention without alteration, for example, by
        passing in special parameters. Possible rewrite:

          The product shall be resistant to any use or
          alteration that would disable or circumvent the key
          escrow mechanism, to include being designed so that
          the key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a
          static patch (i.e., the replacement of a block of
          code by a modified block).*

   6.   The product shall not decrypt messages or files
        encrypted by non-escrowed products, including products
        whose key escrow mechanisms have been altered or
        disabled.

        *Comment. For generality, change to:

          The product shall not decrypt data encrypted by
          non-escrowed products, including products whose key
          escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.*

   7.   The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's
        encrypted information regardless of whether that user
        is the sender or the intended recipient of the
        encrypted inforrnation.

        *Comment. Does it matter whose keys are used, i.e.,
        sender's or receiver's? As worded, this would allow
        for the use of either. If it can be either, then it
        may be necessary to go to many escrow agents to
        decrypt a subject's communications, for example, the
        escrow agent for each person who sends a message to
        the subject. They might be in foreign countries. If
        the intent is to restrict it to the key of the subject
        of an investigation, it might be reworded as:

          The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's
          encrypted information using only the keys
          associated with the user regardless of whether that
          user is the sender or the intended recipient of the
          encrypted information.*

   8.   The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated
        involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of
        multiple decryption keys during the period of
        authorized access.

        *Comment. What is meant by involvement? Participation
        by individuals? What if the escrow agents provide an
        automated way of obtaining keys after an initial
        start-up (e.g., through a TIS data recovery center)?*

   9.   In the event any such product is or may be available
        in the United States, each production copy of the
        software shall either have a unique key required for
        decrypting messages or files that is escrowed in
        accordance with #10, or have the capability for its
        escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and any new key to be
        escrowed in accordance with #10.

        *Comment. Is the purpose of this to ensure that if a
        key is compromised, all program copies are not
        compromised with it -- thus, a single copy can be
        tossed or an entire product line can be rekeyed?*

   10.  The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only
        with escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or
        by foreign governments with which the U.S. Government
        has formal agreements consistent with U.S. law
        enforcement and national security requirements. [No

   Comments on Issues for Key Escrow Agents

   *Comment. Where do entities such as the Bankers Trust
   escrow center (which is involved in the escrow process and
   is needed to find out what escrow agents to go to get keys)
   or the Fortress KISS archive center (which performs an
   auditing/archiving role) fit into this? They don't hold
   keys, but their performance is critical to the system. It
   would seem that any entity that is operationally involved
   in key escrow should satisfy certain properties.*

   1.   What kinds of organizations should be excluded from
        consideration as approved key escrow agents? [NC]

   2.   What sort of legal agreement between the government
        and the key escrow agent is necessary to stipulate the
        responsibilities of the agent? Should this include the
        terms and conditions under which release of a key is
        required? [NC]

   3.   How will liability for unauthorized release of key be
        handled? [NC]

   4.   Should, for example, intentionally misreleasing or
        destroying a key be criminalized? Should this include
        other actions?

        *Comment. It should be a criminal offense to:

        a)  make a key available to someone knowing that that
            person does not have lawful authority to use the
            key,

        b)  obtain or use a key without lawful authority,

        c)  obstruct, impede, or prevent the use of keys when
            there is lawful authority*

   5.   How can the government's needs for confidentiality of
        key release be handled? [NC]

   6.   Should approval of key escrow agents be tied to a
        public key infrastructure (for digital signatures and
        other purposes)?

        *Comment. Should use of the public key infrastructure
        be conditioned on using key escrow encryption?*

   7.   What procedures need to be developed for the storage
        and safeguarding of keys? [NC]

   8.   What are the acceptable performance criteria (e.g.,
        around-the-clock availability, accessibility,
        reliability, etc.) for approved key escrow agents? [NC]

   9.   Under what circumstances will key escrow agents in
        foreign countries be approved? [NC]

   10.  What process will he used to approve escrow agents?
        Costs/who pays? [NC]
