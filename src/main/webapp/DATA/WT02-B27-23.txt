Cosmology is the study of stars and other heavenly bodies. How was the 
universe created, and when will it end? What happens to things that fall
into black holes? <P>

What are black holes? <P>
Israel's recent theoretical discoveries about the interior of black holes.
<P>
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/blackhole.gif>
<P>
Left:- Ground Based Composite Visual/Radio View: The giant elliptical
galaxy NGC 4261 is one of the twelve brightest galaxies in the Virgo
cluster, located 45 million light-years away.  Photographed in visible
light (white) the galaxy appears as a fuzzy disk of hundreds of
billions of stars.  A radio image (orange) shows a pair of opposed jets
emanating from the nucleus and spanning a distance of 88,000
light-years.
<P>
Right:- Hubble Space Telescope Image of NGC 4261: A giant disk of cold gas and dust
fuels a possible black hole at the core of the galaxy.  Estimated to be 300
light-years across, the disk provides astronomers with a clear view of the
bright hub, which
presumably harbors the black hole.  The dark, dusty ring of the hub is a
cold outer region which extends inwards to an ultra-hot area
a few hundred million miles from the suspected black hole.  This
area of dense stars feeds matter into the black hole, where gravity compresses and
heats the material.  Hot gas rushes from the vicinity of the black
hole creating the radio jets.  The jets are aligned perpendicular to
the disk, like an axel through a wheel.  This provides strong
circumstantial evidence for the existence of a black hole "central
engine" in NGC 4261.

<P>

1. The Hubble space telescope has now provided fairly convincing
evidence (like the image above) for black holes at the centre of every galaxy.

<P>

2. As an astronaut falls into a black hole he first passes the "Event Horizon".
At this point he can no longer send signals back out of the black hole. However,
he can still receive messages from outside.

<P>

3. The Inner Horizon. 

<P>

4. Nobody knows what happens in the inner regions of a black hole. Ultimately, the
black hole becomes a "singularity"--an infinitely massive point in space

Objective:<P>

<UL>

<LI> To calculate the mass of a typical black hole.

</UL>


You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> A calculator

<LI> The following information. If gas and stars can be observed orbiting a
black hole at a velocity of v kilometers per second and if the orbiting objects
are at a distance of r light years from the black hole, then the mass of the
black hole in units of solar masses (m) can be calculated with the formula:
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/israel_formula.gif>


</UL>

What to do:<P>

<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     

In a nearby active spiral galaxy (NGC 4258), 21 million light years
away from Earth, there is an object called a "maser" made partly of
water molecules that can be observed orbiting something at the centre
of the galaxy that is probably a black hole. The maser is 0.3 light
years from the black hole (r) and is orbiting it at a speed of 900
Km/sec (v). Calculate the size (i.e.: mass) of the black hole at the centre of this
galaxy. (NOTE: you can look up more about this system in Nature #373,
p. 103, 12 Jan 1996) <P>
In the giant galaxy M87 in the centre of the Virgo cluster
65 million light years from Earth, similar observations and calculations
show a black hole at the centre of M87 with a mass of
two billion suns!!

<HR NOSHADE>

Nobody knows what happens inside a black hole or where things go when they
fall into one. Einstein's theory of relativity explains most things in
the universe, until you get inside a black hole. Israel feels that a quantum
theory of gravity will need to be developed to explain what happens inside
a black hole. Though people have been working towards this goal since Einstein's
time, the quantum theory of gravity has remained elusive.
