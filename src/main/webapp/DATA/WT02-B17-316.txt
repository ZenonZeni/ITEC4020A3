<P><H3>A Word About Money</H3>
<P>Very little comes free, but you can usually find organizations and individuals prepared to donate some goods and services to help your event.
<P>If several organizations are involved in one event, try to divide up the charges among them. Make sure people know exactly what is expected of them in the way of financial contributions.
<P>A kitty of a few hundred dollars or less should see you through if you can persuade others to help you.
<P>Some of the things you may need to spend money on are:
<UL>

<LI>Display space 
<LI>Banner Buttons
<LI>Newspaper supplement 
<LI>Advertising 
<LI>Posters 
<LI>Printing leaflets 
<LI>Refreshments
<LI>Prizes 
<LI>Postage and telephone
</UL>

<P>During Energy Awareness Month, posters and other materials may be available from federal, state, and local governments, many civic and business organizations, and other local utility companies. You may also be able to use these materials at events at other times during the year. On the income or in-kind contribution side, organizations that might provide financial support, goods, or services (office space, telephones, printing) are:
<P>Those taking part in the event:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Local news media 
<LI>Financial institutions
<LI>Shopping centers
