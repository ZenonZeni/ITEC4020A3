<CENTER><H3>FEINGOLD APPLAUDS FEDERAL COURT DECISION IN INTERNET
CASE 
<br>
Preliminary Injunction a victory in fight against government
censorship of new
media</H3></CENTER>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- U.S. Senator Russ Feingold this morning applauded
the Federal District
Court decision giving computer network communications the same
level of protection from
government censorship enjoyed by print media.
<P>
"This is welcome news for all of us who not only support free
speech, but who also want to
see this new, dynamic communications technology develop safe from
the threat of
censorship," Feingold said.
<P>
"I have always argued that legislation attempting to restrict the
content of computer
transmissions is both unnecessary and unconstitutional."
<P>
Feingold said parents who are concerned about the content of
computer communications
reaching their children already have, or should be given,
effective tools to prevent their
children from gaining access to potentially offensive
transmissions.
<P>
"This issue is larger than so-called `adult' expression or
communications," Feingold said.  "It
is about whether the government will decide what we see, hear and
write."
<P>
A 3-judge panel sitting in the U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia today granted a preliminary
injunction preventing the federal government from enforcing the
Communications Decency
Act.  The panel wrote in its decision that, "as the most
participatory form of mass speech yet
developed, the Internet deserves the highest level of protection
from government intrusion."
<P>
Feingold fought against the Communications Decency Act on the
Senate floor, and he was
part of the effort to strike the Act from the Telecommunications
bill signed into law this 
year.<P><HR>
