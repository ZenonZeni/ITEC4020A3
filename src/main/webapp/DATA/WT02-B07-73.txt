<h2>CDA Case Headed to the Supreme Court!</h2>
<p>
<p>
<font size = +1>As expected, the Department of Justice on June 26 announced that it 
will seek an appeal of the recent ruling by a Philadelphia Federal Court finding the 
Communications Decency Act unconstitutional. 
<p>
The Department announced the appeal in a letter (below) to Senator James Exon (D-NE), 
the sponsor of the CDA. No formal appeal documents have yet been filed with the Supreme Court, though more information will be posted here as soon as it become available.
<p>
The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case sometime in the fall or winter.
