The team members of our November expedition to Grenada 

took part in a highly successful exploration of the Bianca C.  The magnificent ocean liner that sank from a fire in 1961, is 600 ft. long and lies in 170 ft. of warm, clear water.  Currently known as the Titanic of the Caribbean, she was probably much more akin to the Andrea Doria, similar in size, Italian and very luxurious.  

The ship is still in very good condition but beginning to deteriorate.  It is estimated that in as little as three years it may become unsafe or impossible to penetrate her.  As it is, very few people ever dive this ship.  Far fewer, still, venture inside.  Two Mad-Dog Expeditions groups are now among the first to have made deep penetrations of her.  In view of this, she is still full of artifacts and remnants of her former life.  

<P><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="Gswim.jpg" WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="139">Our expedition goals were simple.  In six days, we would explore and document as much of her as possible and we would recover any artifacts in imminent danger of being permanently lost.  Equipped with full technical gear (minus the drysuits), an excellent local support team and ample decompression gas, the group broke down into two sections.  One team consisted of technical training students with their instructor, Andrew Driver.  The other was an advanced exploration team led by Kourosh Mahboubian.  

During the course of 96 dives, countless hours of lazy surface intervals by the swimming pool and the formation of some interesting tan lines, we met and exceeded our expectations.  We had each made two dives a day, with six hours in between.  Visibility was <IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Gvests.JPG" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="135">good enough to see the entire ship from half way down the anchor line.  Warm water also meant longer bottom times in total comfort, with only a three millimeter wet suit.  Using air tables and 80% O2 for decompression added a wide safety margin.  Despite feeling ill at ease with all this comfort, our group persevered and on the fourth day, the student team found and recovered the ship's wheel.  It's of solid brass and now sits proudly in the Grenada Museum.  Not to be outdone, the exploration team discovered several new entrances to previously inaccessible passageways, recovered china from the ship's pantry, photographed the dives and left behind some billowing clouds of silt.

For those who would contemplate taking part in a Bianca C expedition, this is a fun trip.  Rest assured though, most of the ship is still waiting to be discovered and there will be some serious exploration.
