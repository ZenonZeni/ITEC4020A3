Targeted For Urban Centers and Municipalities</strong>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) <a target="_parent"
href="/overview">Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
(EE)</a>
is the federal government's principal agency for assisting in the
research, development, and 
commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy
technologies.

<p><strong>Some of the EE Programs targeted for cities
include:</strong>

<p><strong>Municipal Energy Management Program</strong>

<p>Improvements in municipal energy management allow communities to
reallocate energy operating funds 
to meet other needs.  DOE's Municipal Energy Management Program has
funded more than 250 projects that 
demonstrate innovative energy technologies and energy management
tools in 
<a target="_parent"
href="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/cities_counties/cities_counties.html">cities
and counties</a> through 
the <a target="_parent" href="http://pti.nw.dc.us/etf.htm">Urban
Consortium Energy Task Force (UCETF)</a>.  
These projects have helped municipalities identify 
and capitalize upon energy saving opportunities that have already
saved tens of millions of dollars.  
UCETF helps DOE foster municipal energy management through networks
with cities and urbanized 
counties, and through links with three national associations of
local governments the National League 
of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the
International City/County Management 
Association.

<p><strong><a target="_parent"
href="http://www.ccities.doe.gov">Clean Cities</a></strong>

<p>Clean Cities is a program designed to help local businesses and
communities comply with 
environmental regulations, create jobs, and enhance the image of
urban communities by expanding the 
use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV's) in urban communities. 
Despite considerable improvements in 
the fuel efficiency of commercialization and personal vehicles, as a
nation we continue to consume 
more than 60 percent of the oil used in this country for
transportation.  Clean Cities helps to reduce 
our nation's dependence on foreign oil as well as the air pollution
caused by gasoline-powered 
vehicles.  By March 22, 1996, forty-five localities have received
DOE's Clean Cities designation.  By 
the end of 1997, these cities combined intend to have more than
30,000 AFV's in use and establish 700 
refueling and maintenance facilities.

<p><strong>State Energy Program&#151Local Government
Projects</strong>

<p>The State Energy Program (SEP) provides formula grants and
administrative support to states and 
their municipalities in the planning, development, and
implementation of energy efficiency and energy 
resource acquisition programs.  Over the last 15 years, more than
$175 million in grant awards were 
administered by the SEP to 58 local government projects in 26
states.  Over $6 million was awarded 
directly by the SEP between 1990 and 1994.  A good example is the
Local Government Program in Texas 
which has been funded since 1986 to provide energy audits,
educational programs, workshops, 
demonstrations, incentive programs, training and competitive grants.

<p><strong><a target="_parent"
href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#America">Rebuild
America</a></strong>

<p>In partnership with state and local governments and energy
offices, DOE is forming public/private 
partnerships that accelerate energy efficiency improvements to
existing commercial and multifamily 
buildings.  Benefits from revitalizing buildings include:  lower
operating expenses for building 
owners and lower energy costs for tenants, which will allow money to
be reallocated for spending on 
other goods and services, and the creation of new jobs; better
marketability of properties that will 
be more attractive to potential tenants; improved business climate
and community pride; and increased 
worker comfort and productivity.  The 1995 Rebuild America projects
are expected to generate 3,000 
jobs and over $300 million in investments as a result of significant
private sector contributions.

<p><strong><a target="_parent"
href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Cool">Cool
Communities</a></strong>

<p>This program develops community partnerships to plant trees and
increase the use of highly 
reflective exterior surfaces on buildings and roads in order to
reduce heating and cooling costs, and 
improve the environment.

<p>Initiated in 1992, this program is being expanded on three tracks
in cooperation with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency:  six selected Model Communities
will test, demonstrate, and monitor 
the effectiveness of community mobilization techniques; through a
National Outreach Program conducted 
by a consortium of organizations, 250 cities and 100 federal
facilities will implement 
"Cool Community" practices; through a Product Market Collaborative,
research will be conducted to 
characterize urban heat islands, and develop standards for testing
and labeling roofing, exterior 
coatings, and paving materials.

<p>One of the primary benefits of Cool Communities is the energy
cost savings for homeowners and 
businesses.  For example, an analysis of Frederick, Maryland, has
estimated potential savings of 
$3.4 million annually from strategic tree planting around existing
buildings.

<p><strong><a target="_parent"
href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Wise">Climate Wise</a></strong>

<p>State and local governments as well as municipalities are among
the partners in Climate Wise.  This 
program was designed to help commercial and industrial businesses
reap the economic and environmental 
benefits of innovative energy efficiency and waste reduction
technologies.

<p>Three linked programs constitute the approach used to aid
industry:  The Pledge Program allows 
companies to choose from an established list of remedial actions
and/or to create their own plan for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way; The
Recognition Program publicly recognizes 
companies that achieve and record greenhouse gas emission
reductions; and The Tailored Assistance 
Program provides access to business workshops, seminars and a data
bank with information on the latest 
means for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>Greater profits and access to new ideas are among the benefits
companies who participate in this 
program will enjoy.

<p><strong><a target="_parent"
href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Landfills">Methane Recovery
Systems--Landfills</a></strong>

<p>Through this program, municipal and county-owned landfill owners
are among the partners who benefit 
from a new energy source, while at the same time reducing the danger
of landfill gas accidents and 
minimizing methane emissions.  These goals are achieved by: 
expanding the research, development and 
use of enhanced methane gas recovery systems at landfills;
developing and distributing information on 
enhanced design and operation methods for methane gas recovery
systems at landfills; and conducting 
cost-shared demonstrations with interested industries and
communities.
