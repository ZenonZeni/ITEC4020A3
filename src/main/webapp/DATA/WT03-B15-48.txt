<H1>CHINA...<BR>NO ONE IS SAFE</H1>

<P>&quot;Two days ago Amnesty International launched a worldwide
campaign to expose the systematic violation of human rights in
China.
<P>...a launch that signalled the start of global campaigning in the
months ahead by Amnesty members in more than 70 countries and
territories.
<P>...months of public demonstrations, petition signing and lobbying
of governments including at the United Nations.
<P>In short, we will be pulling out all the stops to put pressure
on governments, inter-governmental organizations and the business
community to take concrete action to bring about real changes
in the human rights situation in China.
<P>In China, no-one is safe from human rights violations.
<P>The Chinese authorities have created swathes of repressive legislation
to detain or intimidate political opponents, human rights defenders,
members of religious and ethnic groups and others.
<P>And vague laws open to interpretation are used as a weapon to
achieve the exact same ends.
<P>Unless this whole apparatus is overhauled, no one in China will
be safe.&quot;

GENERAL of AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</B></I>

<P><HR WIDTH="40%">

<P><B>Victims of human rights violations</B> in China are numbered
in the hundreds of thousands. Torture is endemic. So is ill-treatment.
Thousands of political prisoners are in jail, after trials at
which the verdict was decided in advance. Countless numbers of
people are held in administrative detention without being charged.
Each year thousands of people are sentenced to death. In 1994
Amnesty International recorded three times as many executions
in China as in the rest of the world put together.
<P>No one is safe in China. Repressive legislation and the widespread
abuse of power mean that everyone - not just political dissidents
- is at risk. Some violations are committed with the full backing
of the law; others, such as torture, continue in breach of the
law.
<P>China has undergone an economic revolution in recent times. This
has significantly improved the quality of life for many people.
However, economic reforms have not been matched by reform of a
legal system that fosters gross human rights violations.
<P>Dissent and any activity perceived as a threat are repressed.
Independent human rights organizations in China are suppressed.
International human rights organizations are not permitted to
investigate abuses in China.
<P>China's leaders stress the need to expand international cooperation
as a step towards solving the world's problems. Such cooperation
must be extended to human rights issues. China was one of the
governments which adopted, by consensus, the Vienna Declaration
of the 1993 United Nations World Conference on Human Rights. The
Declaration reaffirms that &quot;the promotion and protection
of all human rights is a legitimate concern of the international
community&quot;. The world cannot ignore a fifth of its population
just because they happen to live within China's borders.
