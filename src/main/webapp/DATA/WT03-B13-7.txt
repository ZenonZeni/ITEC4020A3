A NEW NAME, AN EXPANDED MISSION

Dear Subscriber:

     Welcome to the inaugural issue of Mobile Communications
Report, incorporating the former Mobile Satellite Reports -- and
much more.

     In introducing Mobile Communications Report, we're responding
to the clear mandate of our satellite readers to expand our
coverage of nonsatellite mobile communications.  The mobile
satellite industry always has been best understood within the
context of its "allied and competing" industries (as we had dubbed
them in our regular Mobile Satellite Reports feature).  Now,
responding to your requests and to the rapid changes taking place
in mobile communications as a whole, we have created Mobile
Communications Report.

     Our mission is simply stated:  To continue to provide the
industry with the sharpest, most concise and most accurate news and
analysis anywhere.  It's what Warren Publishing has been doing for
more than 50 years.  We will remain the acknowledged authority on
the mobile satellite industry.  We'll apply the same standards to
our fuller treatment of terrestrial mobile communications.

     A final pledge:  Mobile Communications Report, like all of
Warren's publications, never will be something that adds to your
burden of keeping up.  You already have "too much to read."  We
pride ourselves on providing newsletters that our readers want to
read -- because our work is thoughtfully planned, accurately
written and meticulously edited.

     I would love to hear from you, with both comments and
questions.  My number is 202-872-9202, ext. 245.

     Sincerely,
     Daniel Y. Warren
     Associate Publisher and 
        Senior Editor

SECOND FCC PCS AUCTION AT TWICE BIDDING PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEAR
AGO

     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace, with 293
companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds 2 weeks ago,
easily eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richer
companies sought 99 licenses.  Round 4 ended Dec. 21 with
$1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs. $678.9 million through same stage
in earlier auction.  Although licenses cover same territory,
industry observers suggested smaller service areas in Block C
coupled with repeated delays in launching sales may be contributing
to faster pace.  "There is a lot of pent-up demand for these
licenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC Auctions Div.  Auction was
to resume Jan. 5 if govt. shutdown has ended.

     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,
more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" and
FCC was forced to move Stage 2 bidding rules until after holiday
break, Ham told us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with
$166.9 million in net revenue from high bids, although Atlanta
Trunking's erroneous bid of $125 million skewed numbers.  Without
withdrawal of payment owed by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is
$60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham said Stage 2 rules require companies
to bid on 75% of eligible pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, or
face reduction in eligibility.  Auction staff will review bidding
pace after sale resumes -- Jan. 2, if govt. has reopened -- she
said.

     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushed
back start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,
with further one-week delay in first govt. shutdown.  Ham said
pent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probably
contributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief Michele
Farquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in small
packages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also may
contribute to speed of bidding in current sale.

     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smaller
territories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7
billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused on
revenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. 
Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered more
than one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is geared
to Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.

     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reason
for size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for big
companies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, using
ability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority Partner. 
"This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," he
told us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he said
U.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, has
backing from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wireless
entrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-Connect
Communications of Seattle.  To qualify, companies had to have
revenues under $125 million for last 2 years, and assets below $500
million, but Shosteck said several companies had up-front payments
-- in cash -- of more than $50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 million
and NextWave, which is thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79
million.  At end of auction, he said, small companies that bid
"will sell out" to larger companies, leading to news stories on
success of entrepreneurs.

     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,
still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop compared
with other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5
million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) in
Washington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million for
L.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),
DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,
$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  In
Block A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. and
San Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Most
paid $10-$15.

U.S. POSITION ON FUTURE STRUCTURE OF INTELSAT IS IMMINENT

     U.S. is set to finalize position on future structure of
Intelsat as soon as it returns from shutdown, Michael Fitch of
State Dept. Office of International Communications & Information
Policy (ICIP) told recent FCBA conference in Washington.  When U.S.
position is completed, he said, process of changing organization
can be accelerated.  U.S. has proposed creating one or more
separate Intelsat affiliates to compete for new services such as
mobile, direct-to-home, VSAT, other broadband applications. 
PanAmSat has said organization should be split into 3-4 companies
to ensure fair competition.  ICIP head Vonya McCann said "there's
no question that if member governments created [Intelsat and
Inmarsat] today, they would be different."  She said belief when
international satellite organizations were established that single
nation or company couldn't operate satellites has been "shattered"
by advances in technologies and economies.

     PanAmSat lawyer Henry Goldberg said that "given the
marketplace, we don't need intergovernmental treaty organizations"
to provide satellite capacity.  Comsat Gen. Counsel Warren Zeger
said current plan would have 51% of affiliates owned by
non-Intelsat signatories.  Similar Inmarsat affiliate -- ICO -- is
owned almost entirely by Inmarsat and its signatories.  Zeger said
issues involving ownership and governance of affiliates should be
resolved in time to conclude situation at Assembly of Parties in
1997.  Goldberg told us after panel that he doubts U.S. is still
considering divestiture, but is hopeful it will decide on creating
multiple affiliates instead of just establishing single affiliate
for new services.

     On separate issue, industry again rejected auctions as means
of resolving mutually exclusive applications in satellite area. 
Auctions in U.S. "could set off a chain reaction" across world,
Iridium Vp Leo Mondale said.  Systems such as Big LEO that Iridium
proposes "will never get investors because of the uncertainty" of
costs and ability to acquire licenses in auctions, he said:  "What
we're really concerned about is the open-endedness of the auction
process."  Auctions in more than 200 countries could kill satellite
programs, Comsat's Zeger said.

     Mark Grannis, FCC International Bureau legal adviser, said
auctions are fast and efficient and asked whether there's better
way to resolve mutual exclusivity.  While panelists didn't offer
alternatives, we're told industry was prepared to offer several at
Bureau's scheduled policy roundtable that was cancelled because of
govt. shutdown.  Roundtable tentatively has been rescheduled for
Jan. 10 at FCC hq.  Sources said members of Satellite Industry
Assn. haven't reached consensus on what policies to advance, so
companies will offer their ideas individually.

BOEING'S ZENIT-BASED SEA LAUNCH VENTURE GETS ORDER FROM HUGHES

     Hughes ordered up to 10 launches from Boeing, which plans to
use Ukrainian Zenit rockets launched from sea-based platform to
beat prices offered by other providers.  U.S. signed agreement on
Dec. 15 that will allow up to 20 American-built satellites to be
deployed on Ukrainian boosters.  Under accord, Boeing-led Sea
Launch consortium can launch up to 15 satellites and Ukraine itself
as many as 5.  Boeing is lead partner in Sea Launch, which plans to
market launch service to global customers.  Hughes, which said
first flight will be in 1998, was awarded $1-billion contract to
launch satellites of Inmarsat affiliate ICO, which Hughes is
building.  It said it's considering using Zenit for one or more ICO
satellites.

     Hughes signed similar agreement with McDonnell Douglas to use
its planned Delta 3 rocket for up to 10 launches in 1998-2005
period.  "Sea Launch is another solution to what we see as a need
for assured access to launch vehicles and launch slots over the
next few years," Hughes Space & Communications Chmn. Donald Cromer
said.  He said Hughes launch costs will be reduced because, among
other things, Sea Launch will maintain home port in nearby Long
Beach, which will reduce shipping expenses.

     Sea Launch consortium will be licensed under authority of
FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), Dir. Frank
Weaver told reporters Dec. 19.  Home port for Sea Launch is Long
Beach and launches will be from special ship operating in
international waters using Ukrainian Zenit boosters.  Weaver said
OCST derives its authority over company because Boeing is U.S.
corporation that has critical role in project.  Situation is
different from Lockheed Krunichev Energia (LKE) venture that
launches Western payloads on Russian Proton, Weaver said, because
Lockheed's role is limited to marketing.  OCST doesn't license LKE
launches.  Weaver said OCST will inspect Sea Launch hardware and
procedures to ensure safety, and additional approvals may be
required from other U.S. agencies such as Coast Guard and Maritime
Commission.

     Ukraine is allowed to launch up to 20 U.S.-built satellites,
Weaver said, but final number depends on how robust international
launch market is over next few years.  He said low-end projections
indicate there will be about 20 internationally competitive flights
per year, with high-end figure around 30.  Under agreement, if
market averages 24 launches in 1996-1999, Ukraine can fly up to 5
satellites itself and international joint venture with key U.S.
partner (such as Sea Launch) can send up 11 geostationary birds. 
If there are 24 or more launches per year on average during period,
Ukraine can fly up to 6 satellites, while venture has authority to
launch 14.  Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites will be handled
separately, but Weaver said U.S. intends to ensure that American
providers are given "fair consideration."  Globalstar has deal
(part cash, part contribution of services) to launch several of its
LEO satellites on Zenit.

     Meanwhile, Weaver said OCST plans to release first part of
2-part notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in March on proposals
to streamline and simplify procedures at federal launch ranges and
to detail financial responsibilities of govt. and private sector
for commercial launches.  He said date for release of 2nd NPRM
hasn't been determined, but OCST will propose rules for procedures
at "purely commercial spaceports," which have been proposed in 5
states.  It also will include proposed safety rules for planned
reusable launch vehicles, he said.

FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION

     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wireless
interconnection that would mandate interim use of "bill-&-keep" as
reimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep, each carrier terminates
calls for others at no charge.  Commissioners said at final meeting
of 1995 that bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is of
essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economically
perfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."

     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissioners
that interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as the
infrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency is
concerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rules
require "mutual compensation" but don't set more specific
requirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Keeney said.  It doesn't require setting up new billing
systems.

     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaning
LECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but that
situation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, have
complained that LECs are charging them inflated prices for
terminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCC
action, telephone companies will be able to impede development of
PCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.

     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,
Commission will seek comments on other options such as setting
uniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to
terminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.
Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up with
better system "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got to
be speedy."

     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCC
compensation proposal that it said would result in decreased fees
to wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said that
under current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECs
for terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECs
don't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIA
Pres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECs
more than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee can
only act to impede development of wireless as a competitive local
exchange service," he said.

     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren't
stepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to set
compensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as was
eagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationship
with the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.
Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting
state PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate
traffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Commission tentatively concluded that information on
LEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public and
will take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, public
disclosure report or other approach.  Agency also will seek comment
on whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECs
and all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited to
arrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellular
and specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules to
interconnection between LECs and PCS providers.

     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Golden
called FCC action "an important step for making a right that
existed in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applauded
Commission for "doing something fast and simple" rather than
following "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." 
Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC has
taken so far to promote local telephone competition."

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies
announced plans to create regional mobile satellite system called
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT).  Backers of
$640-million project include China Satellite Launch & Tracking
Control, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom, China
Telecommunications Bcst. Satellite, Singapore Telecom, Singapore
Technologies Telemedia.  APMT has requested proposals for 2
satellites and ground facilities.  First launch is planned for 1998
on Long March.  System will compete against Aces project backed by
consortium of Indonesian, Thai and Phillipine companies and
AfroAsia system backed by Indian concerns.  Aces has contract for
Lockheed Martin satellite, AfroAsia will deploy Hughes bird. 
Singapore Telecom withdrew from Aces project but still is part
owner, along with Hughes and others, of American Mobile Satellite. 
However, that doesn't necessarily mean Hughes has edge in
competition to get contract for APMT satellite, analyst Tim Logue
of Reid & Preist said.  "Hughes doesn't have a sweetheart deal," he
said.  Entry of 3rd regional MSS provider in Asia raises questions
about whether market will support that many systems.  Logue said: 
"It's remarkable that 3 geostationary satellite-based systems are
planned for launch by the end of the century for Asia.  There may
be market enough for all to prosper, but the question is -- what
market share does that leave for the Big LEOs?"  He said Big LEOs
have significant investment from region, which will host 6-way
fight for MSS business, "but it's a big continent."

securities class action lawsuit against company on eve of expected
passage of Securities Litigation Reform Act designed to limit
frivolous suits against companies whose stocks experience wide
swing in value.  Suit was filed by attorney William Lerach of
Milberg, Weiss law firm, San Diego, who Trimble Pres. Charles
Trimble said has claimed "constituency" of shareholders, but "in
fact... only needs to find one disgruntled shareholder in order to
claim broad representation."  Trimble called lawsuit, one of more
than 12 filed against high-tech companies since Dec. 1, result of
"clever niche market" that will "drain the energy out of the
entrepreneurial process."

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental
Sciences Group (HES) and Dr. George Carlo as defendants in lawsuit
brought by Debbra Wright, who charged cellular telephone caused
brain cancer and who accused industry of conspiracy to conceal
evidence.  Judge Paddy McNamara said Wright case, originally filed
against Motorola, included substantial evidence but nothing linking
HES to conspiracy.  He's expected to issue written opinion this
month and rule in March on similar charges Wright filed against
Wireless Technology Research (WTR), which also is headed by Carlo
and set up by industry to study health effects of cellular phones. 
WTR said all allegations should be dismissed because "they are
based on the same key factual issues the judge has now resolved...
WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wasteful
attacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of
the research necessary to answer the public's questions about the
health effects of all wireless technology and that these tactics
could themselves pose threats to public health if they delay
implementation of any interventions that may prove necessary."

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC
seeking to avoid substantial withdrawn-bid penalty in specialized
mobile radio auction (SMR) after intended $125,000 bid became
$125-million error.  Company said bid filed electronically carried
3 extra zeros.  In waiver request, it asked Commission to consider
size of company and nature of mistake in granting waiver.  Full
Commission will have to review request at end of auction, lawyer
Diane Law said.  Under FCC rules, company that withdraws bid is
liable for penalty based on difference between withdrawn offer and
eventual high bid at end of sale.  Company earlier bid $1,100 for
same license, designated P frequency block;  high bid before error
was about $100,000, submitted by FCI 900 -- which is Nextel. 
Atlanta Trunking resubmitted $125,000 bid in Round 10, FCC said. 
Efforts to contact company, part of Southland Corp. and SMR
operator at 900 MHz in Atlanta, were unsuccessful.  Meanwhile,
Commission said software used to report activity on 1,040 SMR
licenses has glitch preventing quick reporting and summarizing of
auction results on daily basis, and Round 12 and 13 results for
Dec. 20-21 were delayed.  Net revenue in Round 13 Dec. 21 increased
0.85% to $166,880,732 from 97 new bids.  On Dec. 20, total was 
$165.5 million, with 105 high bids and 112 eligible bidders.  In
final round of year, Paging Network offered $13.2 million for 87
licenses, including high bids of $925,000 in N.Y., $575,000 in L.A.
and Detroit, $545,000 in San Francisco.  Geotek had $10.8 million
in high bids on 179 licenses, and FCI 900 -- Nextel -- had $10.3
million on 222.  Auction resumes Fri.
