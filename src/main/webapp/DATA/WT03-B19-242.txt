Climate and Geography
</H1>

Victoria's climate is mild, with snow falling only in the alpine area 
during winter. Maximum elevation is about 2000 metres but most of the State 
is between 200 and 1200 metres above sea level. The Great Dividing 
Range, running east-west across the State, separates the Murray 
Basin plains to the north from a complex of uplands and plains in the south.
<BR>

The south of the State tends to receive more rain than the north and 
is generally cooler in summer. Victoria's temperate climate, 
topography and diverse soil types allow the production of a wide range 
of agricultural products, including field crops, cereals, fruit and 
vegetables, table and wine grapes, and livestock.

<BR>
<BR>
In the west, fertile volcanic plains make up some of Australia's best 
farmland. In the south-east lies one of the world's largest deposits 
of brown coal in the Latrobe Valley, used primarily for electricity 
generation, while further east the irrigated plains are used for 
dairy farming. Grain crops are concentrated in the fertile clay plains of 
the Wimmera and Mallee in the north-west and further north, the 
irrigated Sunraysia district along the Murray River supports citrus and
vine production.

<BR>
<BR>
As it is characterised by moderate temperatures, without great daily 
or seasonal extremes, and medium relative humidity, the Victorian climate 
is conducive to the performance of a wide range of industrial processes. 
For many of these activities, the climate also serves to minimise 
energy costs. This is particularly the case where the temperature 
and relative humidity of significant volumes of air space have to be 
controlled for product manufacture or storage.
