<table cellspacing=20><tr valign=top><td><H3>Corrections</H3></td><td> The scene is rectified according to a given cartographic projection (conformal Lambert, UTM, oblique equatorial, polar stereographic, polyconic, etc.). The image is also rotated and aligned with true north.<P>

Corrections are performed using only satellite attitude data (variations in the satellite attitude during imaging) and imaging geometry without using ground control points (topographic maps are not therefore required).<BR> These corrections and the consideration of a reference elevation chosen by the customer make level 2A more accurate than level 1B.<P>
</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Accuracy</H3></td><td>
Although the image's internal accuracy is better (0.0005) compared to level 1B, absolute location accuracy is unchanged (approximately 500m). It can, however, be accurately adjusted by X and Y translation with respect to a known point.</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Image size</H3></td><td>
Resampling increases both the number of pixels per line and the number of lines, in proportions that vary according to viewing angle and image orientation angle. The rectangular shape of the image is restored by adding border pixels.<BR>
Level 2A products can be supplied as full scenes or as quarter scenes</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>File Size</H3></td><td>
In panchromatic (P) mode, the number of pixels per line is between 6000 and 10200 (depending of viewing angle  and image orientation angle). <BR>Since a pixel is coded over 1 byte, the total volume of a digital product can vary between 36 Mbytes and 100 Mbytes (not including border pixels and auxiliary data files).<P>

In multispectral (XS) mode, and for each spectral band, the number of pixels per line and the number of lines can vary between 3000 and 5100. <BR>Since each pixel is coded over 3 bytes (XS mode) the total  volume of a digital product can vary between 36 Mbytes and 100 Mbytes (not including border pixels and auxiliary data files).
</td></tr>     

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Use</H3></td><td>This is the level used when a standard cartographic projection without a high location accuracy is required.</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Format</H3></td><td> Level 2A products are distributed in <A HREF=cap.html>SPOT Standard digital product format</a>.
