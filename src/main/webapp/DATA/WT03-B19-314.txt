<P>
The CRC for Temperate Hardwood Forestry was established in 1991 to enhance the productivity and sustainability of temperate hardwood forestry through basic and innovative research. Its headquarters are in Hobart.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The CRC is undertaking three research programs:
<UL>
<LI>Genetic Improvement: aims to achieve plantation production gains by improving genetic stock. This involves initially identifying the genetic resource and then deploying this matter into plantations.
<LI>Soil and Stand Management: examines forest growth and yield with respect to environmental factors such as temperature, climate and the availability of nutrients and water from the soil system.
<LI>Resource Protection: aims to enhance productivity within native forests and plantations by reducing loss of productivity caused by insects, vertebrates and disease damage.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Progress has been made in the areas of evaluating genetic resources and basing selections for breeding and eventual deployment into plantations on this information. Basic understanding of the biological processes within the forest system is enabling better management decisions to be made in order to increase productivity and maintain the inherent capacity of the land for future production.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Forestry as a business is different to many others as the turn around time between rotations is of the order of decades rather than years. The gain in productivity of eucalypt plantations through improved genetic stock and improved establishment practices has been estimated at more than 200 cubic metres of wood per hectare over 20 years.
 Implementation of the results of research are shown in dynamic and improved decision making in plantation management and through the incorporation of selected genetic stock within our plantations.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Amcor Plantations, an industry participant in the CRC, is Australia's largest private forestry company, with an estate of over 50,000 hectares of both hardwood and softwood plantations in Gippsland, Victoria.
The company is in the process of expanding the area of eucalypt (hardwood) plantation and is aiming for better productivity from existing and future plantation areas through a comprehensive R&D program. A component of the field research occurs on APLÕs site in Gippsland, Victoria.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Training is offered in the form of workshops for industry staff and postgraduate studies generally undertaken in Hobart.
