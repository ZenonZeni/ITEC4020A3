<h2>Electrical Contacts</h2>
<p><strong>Transparent Conductors</strong>

<p>An alternative to grid contacts is a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) such
as tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>). The advantage of TCOs is that they are nearly invisible to incoming light, 
yet form a good bridge from the semiconductor to the external circuit. TCOs are very useful in 
manufacturing processes when a glass "superstrate" is used for depositing layers of 
<a href="thinfilms.html">thin films</a> (such
as those of amorphous silicon and cadmium telluride). In this process, the TCO is generally deposited
as a thin film on the glass superstrate before the semiconducting layers. These layers are then
deposited, followed by a metallic contact that will actually be the bottom of the cell. In this 
manner, the cell is actually "built" upside down, from the top to the bottom.

<p>But the construction technique isn't the only thing that determines whether a metallic grid or TCO is
best for a certain cell design. The "sheet resistance" of the semiconductor is also an important 
consideration. In crystalline silicon, for example, the semiconductor carries charge (electrons) well enough to
reach a finger of the metallic grid. Because the metal conducts electricity better than a TCO does, 
shadowing losses are less than the losses that would be associated with using a TCO. <a href="
amorphous.html">Amorphous silicon</a>, on the other hand, conducts very poorly in the horizontal 
direction and therefore benefits from having a TCO over every bit of its surface.
