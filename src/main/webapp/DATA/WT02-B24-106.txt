<h1>PARENTS</h1>
<h2>Your child looks perfectly normal but . . .</h2>
<h2>you suspect something is  wrong.</h2>
<h2><i>Why?</i></h2>

<h2>Does your child have an uneven pattern of<br>"Can Do's" and "Can't
Do's"?</h2>

in some ways. Development may be 
<ul>

<p>Often it is the parents who first have concerns when their toddlers are
not "on target" in their development. Sometimes areas of delayed
development are first detected in the doctor's office. It often takes
longer to notice uneven development patterns than to notice overall
delayed development. 

<p><b>Warning signs are just that . . . warnings. </b><br>
They don't necessarily mean there are problems, but they should be
discussed with your pediatrician or family physician at your next visit.
If your toddler is developing normally, your doctor will be able to
reassure you. 

<p>Early intervention with a child who is behind in social, cognitive,
fine motor, gross motor, and/or language development can make a world of
difference. If you see some of these signs in your child, you want to
contact your school district, primary physician, or the local, state or
national LDA office for information. They can guide you on where to start
in determining whether your child has some delays in areas of development. 

<p>Federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities IDEA), provides for a
free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities. This
includes early intervention for preschool children who need special
education services.

education.
