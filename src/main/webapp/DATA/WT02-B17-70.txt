<P>
DSM began in the <A HREF="us_dsm.html">United States</A> as utilities
recognized the economic and environmental advantages offered by programs
that modified customer demands compared to the cost of acquiring new
sources of supply. Since its orgins in the U.S. some 15-20 years ago,
DSM has spread to many parts of the world. Most <A HREF="eu_dsm.html">European
Union</A> countries have some forms of DSM programs in place.  DSM
programs have also been initiated in Central and South America, as well
as in <A HREF="asia_dsm.html">Asia</A>.</P>
