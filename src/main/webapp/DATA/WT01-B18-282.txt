<P><B>9513:&nbsp;  Access to Therapeutic Marijuana/Cannabis</B> 
 
<P>The American Public Health Association, 
<DD>Being aware that cannabis/marijuana has been used medicinally 
for centuries and that cannabis products were widely prescribed 
by physicians in the United States until 1937;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being aware that "marijuana" prohibition began with the 
Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 under false claims despite disagreeing 
testimony from the AMA's representative;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being further aware that the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 
completely prohibited all medicinal use of marijuana by placing 
it in the most restrictive category of Schedule I, whereby drugs 
must meet three criteria for placement in this category: 1) have 
no therapeutic value, 2) are not safe for medical use, and 3) 
have a high abuse potential;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#5">5</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being cognizant that the Drug Enforcement Administration's own 
administrative law judge ruled in 1988 that marijuana must be 
removed from Schedule I and made available for physicians to 
prescribe;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#6">6-8</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Knowing that 36 states have passed legislation recognizing 
marijuana's therapeutic value;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Also knowing that the only available access to legal marijuana 
which was through the Food and Drug Administration's 
Investigational New Drug Program has been closed by the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services since 1992;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#11">11</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Understanding that while synthetic Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) 
is available in pill form, it is only one of approximately 60 
cannabinoids which may have medicinal value individually or in 
some combination; and 
<DD>Understanding that marijuana has an extremely wide acute 
margin of safety for use under medical supervision and cannot 
cause lethal reactions;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Understanding that marijuana has been reported to be effective 
in: a) reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a></SMALL></SUP> b) 
reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#14">14-16</a></SMALL></SUP> 
c) stimulating the appetite for patients living with AIDS 
(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and suffering from the 
wasting syndrome;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#17">17-19</a></SMALL></SUP> d) controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#20">20-25</a></SMALL></SUP> e) decreasing the suffering from chronic pain;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#26">26-28</a></SMALL></SUP> and f) controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#29">29-31</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Understanding that marijuana seems to work differently than 
many conventional medications for the above problems, making it a 
possible option for persons resistant to the conventional 
medications;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being concerned that desperate patients and their families are 
choosing to break the law to obtain this medicine when conventional medicines or treatments have not been effective for them or are too toxic;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Realizing that this places ill persons at risk for criminal 
charges and at risk for obtaining contaminated medicine because 
of the lack of quality control; and 
<DD>Realizing that thousands of patients not helped by conventional medications and treatments, may find relief from their suffering with the use of marijuana if their primary care providers were able to prescribe this medicine; and 
<DD>Concluding that cannabis/marijuana was wrongfully placed in 
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances depriving patients of its 
therapeutic potential; 
<DD>Recognizing that APHA adopted a resolution (7014) on Marijuana 
and the Law which urged federal and state drugs laws to exclude 
marijuana from classification as a narcotic drug;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#36">36</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Concluding that greater harm is caused by the legal 
consequences of its prohibition than possible risks of medicinal 
use; therefore 
<DD>1.&nbsp;  Encourages research of the therapeutic properties of 
various cannabinoids and combinations of cannabinoids; and 
<DD>2.&nbsp;  Encourages research on alternative methods of 
administration to decrease the harmfull effects related to 
smoking; and 
<DD>3.&nbsp;  Urges the Administration and Congress to move 
expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine 
where shown to be safe and effective and to immediately allow 
access to therapeutic cannibis through the Investigational New 
Drug Program.
