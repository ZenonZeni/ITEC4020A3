<b><h3>Latest News:</h3>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><i>As at 26th November 1996</i></FONT></b>
<p>
The 3rd Edition of this book was published in 1993 and, as users will appreciate, it will have had limited value over the last few months - particularly with the changes in additive legislation in early 1996 and the new Food Labelling Regulations from 1 July 1996.
<p>
The 3rd Edition is now out of print but you will be interested to know that a new 4th Edition will be available in early 1997.   The typescript is now with the publishers, Butterworth-Heinemann.  More definite news will be given on this page when it is known.
<p>
If you would like to be sent information on the new book (including an order form), send an e-mail to the above address and I will make sure you are added to the circulation list for publicity material when it becomes available in early 1997.
<p>
Thanks for your interest.
