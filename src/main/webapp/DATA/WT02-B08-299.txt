<h3>
Ocean season data helps scientists better estimate the global heat exchange between the oceans and atmosphere.

<p>
These data show how sea level varies from the yearly average during fall and spring.  At middle latitudes, the seasonal sea level change depends on the heating and cooling of the upper ocean.  The highest sea level occurs in fall when the ocean has been heated throughout summer.  The lowest sea level is found during the spring off the east coast of the continents in the Northern Hemisphere.  This is because, throughout the winter, cold continental winds blow over ocean and remove an great amount of heat.  In fact, the seasonal sea level changes are about twice as great in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, partly because of the greater concentration of continents in the Northern Hemisphere.
