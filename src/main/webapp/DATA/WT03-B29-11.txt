Fuel Cell Material
Attracts DuPont

DuPont (Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel: 800/441-7515) scientists have
produced a composite fluorinated ion exchange membrane intended for
use as a separator in fuel cells and as a selective barrier in
permeation separation and facilitated transport processes.  Shoibal
Banerjee reports that the membrane attains greater mechanical
strength than conventional materials used for such applications
without sacrificing other required qualities.  The DuPont membrane,
which includes a fluorinated ion exchange polymer film bonded to a
porous hydrocarbon substrate, is nonporous to the bulk flow of
fluids but permits ions, especially cations, to move across its
structure.

In electrochemical cells, such as electrolytic cells or fuel cells,
it is important to provide a separator between the anode and
cathode compartments.  Chemically stable ion exchange membranes
made from perfluorosulfonic acid polymers are used, particularly
for the electrolysis of brine. DuPont's trademarked Nafion membrane
is a well recognized membrane of this type.

Quality, safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness considerations
specify that fuel cell separators should be tear, abrasion,
puncture, and scratch resistant.  On the other hand, they should
not be so thick and/or reinforced that they are resistant to ionic
conduction or power requirements are excessively high.

Membrane resistance can be reduced by decreasing the membrane
thickness and increasing its water content.  The problem is that
along with a reduction in electrical resistance, this brings about
a big reduction in membrane strength.  Mechanical strength in
electrochemical cells is important.

Many fuel cells operate at high differential pressures, which
increase the likelihood of damage to the membranes.  Fuel cells
used in motor vehicles are subject to multiple shutdown and startup
procedures, and this cycling leads to membrane dehydration and
rehydration.  The resultant stress further increases the likelihood
of damage to the membrane.

Reinforced ion exchange membranes are also used to separate
mixtures of fluids with different permeation rates.  Such membranes
are often wound with macroporous meshes which permit the free flow
of fluids to and from the membrane surfaces.  Thin perfluoroionomer
films have high permeability to water and other polar molecules,
but effective permeation separation modules cannot be manufactured
from these thin, fragile materials.

Facilitated transport is a related separation technique in which a
continuous membrane is plasticized or swollen with a liquid.  The
dissolved liquid complexes with one of the fluids to be separated
and selectively facilitates its transport across the membrane.
Although perfluoroionomer offer advantages in some of these
applications, e.g., the separation of amino acids in aqueous media,
they do not have enough strength to undergo module construction or
to withstand operating pressure differentials.

The porous substrate of the DuPont membrane is made from a linear
high density polyethylene (LHDPE) polyolefin hydrocarbon woven or
nonwoven fabric with a melting point below 220(C.  The bond between
the substrate and the fluorinated polymer is formed by applying a
solvent to the surface of the substrate and then adding the
substrate.  The ion exchange polymer, a perfluorosulfonate or
perfluorocarboxylate, is solubilized by the solvent and flows into
and adheres to the pores of the substrate.  Suitable solvents
include aliphatic alcohols, perfluorinated aromatic compounds, and
perfluorotrialkylamines.

The DuPont composite membrane could be used as a reinforced thin
selective barrier in chemical separations, providing mechanical
strength without sacrificing low resistance to the selective
transport characteristics inherent in a thin perfluoro ion exchange
membrane.  The membrane may be used as an electrolytic separator
between anode and cathode compartments in a fuel cell.  It may also
be used as a thin, continuous barrier in permeation separations and
in facilitated transport operations.  The fabric provides
mechanical support and the spaces between the fibers provide
avenues for fluids to pass to and from the surface of the membrane
without sacrificing the high permeation rates to water and other
hydrophilic materials.  U.S. Patent 5,447,636 fully outlines the
DuPont work.

Zeroing in on an
Economic Discharge

Scientists from Bechtel Power Corp. (Doswell Combined Cycle
Facility, Rte. 4, P.O. Box 1643, Ashland, VA 23005), Resources
Conservation Co. (3006 Northup Way, Bellevue, WA 98004; Tel:
206/828-2400) and Ionics Inc. (5455 Garden Grove Blvd., No. 321,
Westminster, CA 92683) have been working on the integration of
membrane processes with evaporation to achieve economical zero
liquid discharge at the Doswell Combined Cycle Facility.  The
results of this study were published in Desalination (102, 81-86,
1995).

New restrictive permitting, operating and environmental
requirements placed on independent power producers, utility power
plants, chemical processing plants, refineries and other industrial
installations are mandating zero liquid discharge of wastewater to
sewers, rivers, deep wells and the like.  Economic reclamation and
reuse of wastewater is becoming essential.

Since the mid-70s, vapor compression evaporation has been a
preferred means to achieve zero liquid discharge.  Evaporation
recovers about 95% of a wastewater as distillate for reuse.  Waste
brine can be reduced to solids in a crystallizer/dewatering device.
However, evaporation alone can be an expensive option when flow
rates are large or when wastewater is not extremely high in total
dissolved solids (TDS).  As a result, grassroots power plants and
other industrial facilities often find it difficult to economically
justify a zero liquid discharge system.

One way to solve this problem is to integrate membrane processes
with evaporation.  By combining membrane processes such as
electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and/or reverse osmosis (RO) with
evaporation, the synergism makes zero liquid discharge an easier
goal to achieve.

An example of this hybrid approach for economical zero liquid
discharge is the installation of EDR plus RO along with evaporation
and crystallization at the Doswell combined Cycle Power Plant in
Hanover County, VA.  Use of membrane processes to preconcentrate
and reclaim plant wastewaters has significantly reduced the
evaporator feed volume, resulting in a 62% downsizing of the
evaporator system.

Without the EDR and RO system, the evaporator/crystallizer system
would have treated 250 gallons per minute of wastewater at a total
dissolved solids concentration of 2900 parts per million.  Using
the combined EDR and RO systems to pretreat wastewater helped
reduce the evaporator feed volume to about 90 gpm with a higher TDS
concentration of 9700 ppm.  Compared to straight
evaporation/crystallization, the hybrid approach reduced overall
capital costs by $900,000 and saves energy and operating costs by
$680 per operating day.

Lea Ronal's New
H3PO2 Acid Method

Lea Ronal Inc. (272 Buffalo Ave., Freeport, NY 11520; Tel: 516/868-
8800, Fax: 516/868-8774) has been issued a patent for electrolytic
production of phosphinic (hypophosphorous) acid (U.S. 5,480,517).
Hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) or phosphinic acid, is a staple acid
of commerce and is sold for uses such as the manufacture of
hypophosphite salts, as well as to prevent the discoloration of
phosphate esters, in esterification catalysts, and for the
manufacture of cooling water treatment chemicals. H3PO2 finds use
in metal finishing procedures, as a reducing agent for electroless
plating, and as a sealer for phosphated steel.

The manufacture of hypophosphorous acid has generally been carried
out by somewhat complex and expensive methods utilizing ion
exchange procedures. In these procedures the sodium ion of sodium
hypophosphite is exchanged for a hydrogen ion using an ion exchange
resin therefor. These procedures result in hypophosphorous acid
being a rather expensive commodity, generally at over $7.00 per
pound.

Electrodialysis is also a known process which has been utilized for
various purposes. Alkali salt-containing aqueous solutions with
salts and complexes of metal anions and cations can be fed to the
catholyte, and the metal cations are removed as insoluble
hydroxides by controlling the pH therein. In this process, the
anions are transported across an anion permeable membrane into the
anolyte, where they are converted to acids or halogens.

It is of interest to develop a novel and more economical method for
producing hypophosphorous acid. Lea Ronal's method for preparing
hypophosphorous acid comprises electrodialysis using anionic and
cationic exchange membranes to convert hypophosphite salts, such as
alkali metal hypophosphite salts, into hypophosphorous acid and
alkali hydroxide. These results are achieved by conducting
electrodialysis through an insoluble anode and an anolyte
comprising hypophosphite ions and a cathode and a catholyte
comprising alkali (sodium) ions. Electrolysis of the water supplies
hydrogen ions to the anolyte and hydroxyl ions to the catholyte.

Palladium Composite
Removes Hydrogen

A hydrogen selective palladium-ceramic composite membrane designed
by researchers at Oregon State University (OSU, Corvallis, OR
97331; Tel: 541/737-0123) is one more attempt to overcome the
problems associated with conventional membranes intended for the
separation of hydrogen from gas mixtures at high temperatures and
pressures.  John P. Collins and J. Douglas Way formed the new
membrane described in U.S. Patent 5,451,386, from a porous,
tubular, asymmetric ceramic support with pore sizes in excess of 10
nanometers (nm).  The scientists deposited a layer of palladium 10-
20 microns thick on the inside surface of the ceramic support.

Numerous industrial processes require the selective removal of
hydrogen from a reaction media, e.g., the production of hydrogen by
decomposing ammonia and recovering hydrogen from the resultant
mixture.  Key factors in this process are the temperature and
pressure of the reaction mixture.  It can be difficult to separate
a gas from a mixture at high temperatures and pressures using
conventional packed bed reactors because high concentrations of
hydrogen and nitrogen favor the formation of ammonia.

The three materials commonly used in membranes to remove hydrogen
are polymers; metals or metal alloys, e.g., palladium or palladium
alloys; and ceramics.  Each has problems that restrict
effectiveness in separating the hydrogen.  Polymers have low
thermal and mechanical strength.  Metal and metal alloy membranes
are impractical for use on a commercial scale because of high cost,
low hydrogen flux, and a tendency to deform at high temperatures.
Ceramics can resist high temperatures and pressures, but they allow
mixtures of ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen to filter through the
membrane showing low selectivity.

The OSU composite membrane can selectively remove hydrogen from gas
mixtures at pressures in the 500(C range and transmembrane
pressures of about 1,500 kPa.  The hydrogen-to-nitrogen selectivity
is about 600.

The membranes are produced in a four-step process that includes the
use of sensitizing, activating, and plating solutions;
pretreatment; activation; and plating.  First, the ceramic tubes
are placed in a sensitizing bath which deposits a layer of
colloidal tin ions on their inside surfaces.  Solutions of tin (IV)
chloride pentahydrate and tin (II) chloride dihydrate are used to
make the sensitizing bath.  Second, the activating bath, a solution
of palladium chloride, deposits a uniform layer of finely dispersed
palladium crystals on the ceramic membrane surfaces.  The third
bath, which involves a tetramine palladium chloride complex, is the
source of the activated palladium metal applied to the structure.

Air Products Offers
a Radiation Cure

John Kaiser and Diwakar Garg of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195; Tel: 610/481-4911) have
discovered a method of producing a low-cost, nitrogen-based inert
atmosphere suitable for radiation curing of resins, coatings, etc.
(U.S. Patent 5,480,682).  Residual oxygen present in non-
cryogenically generated nitrogen is converted to either moisture or
a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide by reaction with a
reducing gas in a catalytic reactor prior to using the nitrogen-
based atmosphere for radiation curing of moisture insensitive
materials such as resins and coatings.

Radiation curing is a chemical manufacturing process which utilizes
electromagnetic radiation energy to change the chemical and
physical nature of organic chemical materials by cross-linking,
polymerizing, drying, solidifying or degrading polymer network.
Radiation curing processes are commercially applied today for
adhesives, abrasives, release coatings, metal coatings, overprint
coatings, flooring, wood finishing, food and perfume packaging,
printing, photopolymer plates, electronics, dental and medical
applications, magnetic media, fiber optics, lithography, etc.

The primary sources of radiation for radiation curing include
electron beam (e-beam), infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and laser.
It is generally known that a part of radiation energy used for
curing resins and coatings is converted to heat during curing,
causing an increase in the atmosphere temperature. It is known that
an increase in the atmosphere temperature will raise the
temperature of the coating being cured, which can damage the
coating or result in cured coating with some undesirable
properties. It is, therefore, desirable to carefully control the
temperature of both the atmosphere and the coating being cured to
obtain optimum material properties.

Overheating of the atmosphere and the coating being cured can be
controlled by using a high speed at which the curing coating
traverses under the radiation source. Additionally, a water-cooled
drum positioned directly under the radiation source can also be
used to help in removing heat from the radiation chamber and the
substrate being cured. However, black bodies, soft substrates, and
temperature sensitive substrates still require proper care and an
external source for removing heat from the radiation chamber.

To properly control the temperature in the radiation chamber and
produce cured coatings with desirable properties, these materials
are generally processed in the presence of high flow rates of an
ambient temperature and high purity (containing 99.999% by volume
inert gas) inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon or helium. The high
flow rate of high purity inert gas helps in removing heat and
preventing buildup of heat in the radiation chamber.

Besides controlling the temperature of the coating, high purity
inert gas prevents buildup of oxygen in the radiation curing
chamber, which is known to abstract hydrogen from the coating
material and inhibit the curing process, as well as form ozone gas.
The use of high purity nitrogen gas for inerting radiation curing
chambers and purging oxygen barriers has been known for years. The
nitrogen gas used in radiation curing is generally supplied by
vaporizing more expensive cryogenically produced high purity liquid
nitrogen.

Ceramic Composite
Separates Oxygen

The Gas Research Institute (3424 S. State St., Chicago, IL  60616)
has developed composite ceramic ion and electronic conduction
materials with high ambipolar activity which can be fabricated into
thin membranes for high efficiency oxygen separation from air at
intermediate temperatures (U.S. Patent 5,478,444).

The mixed conducting materials have composite non-homogeneous
microstructures of a separate predominantly oxygen ion conductive
phase and a predominantly electronic conductive phase.
Predominantly oxygen ion conducting phases include bismuth, cerium
and thorium oxide based materials and predominantly electronic
conducting phases include at least one metal, metal oxide of at
least one metal, and at least one perovskite-type electronic
conductor material.

Prior materials used in oxygen separation have been electrolyte
materials, such as yttrium stabilized zirconia or ceria with CaF2
fluorite structure, which are predominantly oxygen ion conductors.
In electrolytes of such predominantly ionic conducting materials,
oxygen transport takes place on the ionic conducting electrolyte
while electrons move through an external electron circuit to
maintain electrical neutrality.

In addition to electrolyte materials such a prior device required
two electrodes as well as an external connection between the
electrodes, for example, porous platinum electrode layers and
platinum wire leads, both operating at high temperatures. An oxygen
semipermeation separation device according to the present invention
based on a mixed ionic-electronic conduction composite electrolyte
membrane eliminates the two porous electrodes and external electron
circuit.

Solid oxygen ion conducting electrolytes based on zirconium oxide
or cerium oxide have been used, but require relatively high
operating temperatures of about 1,000C since oxygen ionic
conductivity of these materials becomes significant only at high
temperatures, such as about 0.1 S/cm total electrical conductivity
at 1,000C for yttria stabilized zirconia.

Bismuth oxide has an electrical conductivity of higher than 0.33
S/cm at 750C which is much higher than zirconium oxide or cerium
oxide at that temperature. Use of ionic-electronic mixed conducting
materials based on bismuth oxide as an electrolyte, according to
this invention, permits the operating temperature of an oxygen
separation device to be at markedly lower temperatures than prior
zirconium oxide or cerium oxide based materials.

Montmorillonite
Shows Promise

It has been known for a long time that a membrane made of a pure
clay rejects ionic solutes.  The application of such a membrane in
separation technology, however, has never been attempted.
Researchers from The National Research Institute of Agricultural
Engineering (2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305 Japan), and the
University of Ottawa (Industrial Membrane Research Institute, Dept.
of Chemical Engineering, and Dept. of Chemistry, Ottawa K1N 6N5)
explored that possibility by investigating the solute separation
characteristics of a montmorillonite membrane.  Their findings have
been published in Journal of Membrane Science [107, 87-92, 1995].

As membrane separation technology broadens its scope, resistance
against heat, chemicals and corrosion becomes an increasingly
desired feature of the membrane material.  Unfortunately, polymeric
materials form which most commercial membranes are produced do not
necessarily meet these requirements.  For this reason, many studies
have been conducted on the development of inorganic membranes.

Various methods have been applied to prepare membranes from
inorganic material.  Alumina membranes were prepared by the sol-gel
method for ultrafiltration and microfiltration, zeolite membranes
were prepared for the separation of gas and vapor mixtures, and
zeolite particles were incorporated into silicone rubber to form a
composite membrane for pervaporation.

A montmorillonite membrane with a thickness of 0.5 mm was prepared
by sandwiching purified clay paste between two millipore filters
and reverse osmosis experiments were conducted for various
inorganic and organic solutes under an operating pressure of 3 MPa.

The membrane exhibited characteristics typical for a charged
membrane by rejecting sodium chloride solute less effectively with
increasing solute concentration.  The rejection of small organic
solutes was very low.  It was also found that the separation of
amino acids greatly depends on the net charge carried by the amino
acid molecule.  This membrane, it was found, opens up a route to
the effective fractionation of electrolyte/non-electrolyte mixtures
and amino acid mixtures.

Depositing Mol Sieves
on Macroporous Support

Eduard Geus and a team of Technische Universiteit Delft
(Julianalaan 134, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands; Tel: 15/789111,
Fax: 15/786522) researchers have made what they believe is a
breakthrough in creating a membrane that has the advantages of
molecular sieves membranes without the disadvantages.  Their
technology applies molecular sieve crystals, in a monolayer, on a
macroporous support.  The crystals have been oriented to a
substantial extent, such that the pores of the sieve crystals form
a significant included angle with the support surface.  The
membrane forms a gastight matrix between the crystals.

Geus et al write, in U.S. Patent 5,429,743, that their goal is to
manufacture a membrane with the highest possible degree of coverage
of molecular sieve crystals on the support.  In this way,
researchers realize the maximum membrane surface.  They emphasize
the importance of the form of the crystals and the uniformity of
the particle size.  The use of crystalline microporous materials,
such as the molecular sieve crystals, makes it possible to adjust
the pore size distribution on a molecular level.

The scientists describe the best configuration for a molecular
sieve membrane as occurring when the crystals are the only
separation between two fluids.  Then molecules can pass directly
from the first (or retentate) phase to the second (or permeate)
phase only through the micropores of the molecular sieve crystals.

One method involves the scattering of molecular sieve crystals on
the support.  Low frequency vibrations are used to form a crystal
monolayer that achieves about 80% coverage.  Even higher coverage
can be realized by using a liquid flow over a porous substrate with
the same liquid. This action pushes up the molecular sieve crystals
up to form an almost continuous layer on the support.

In another process, molecular sieve crystals are treated with a
surfactant, facilitating the formation of a hydrophobic surface by
the crystals.  These molecular sieves float on water.  A
macroporous support can be formed underneath the monolayer of
molecular sieve crystals.

Add Two More to
U.S. Filter Roster

A U.S. Filter Corp. (73-710 Fred Waring Dr., Palm Desert, CA 92260;
Tel: 619/340-0098) representative told us that at this time,
contrary to rumors, the company has not purchased FilmTec.  In last
month's issue of MSTN, we reported that Dow was consolidating
FilmTec's membrane manufacturing in Minneapolis, along with all R&D
activities.  Shortly after Dow's announcement, rumors began to fly
that FilmTec would become the next company to be swallowed by U.S.
Filter.

The company has, however, found something to munch on.  U.S. Filter
signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jet Tech, Inc. (1051 Blake
St., Kansas City, KS 66111; Tel: 915/422-7812, Fax: 915/422-7650)
for approximately $12 million in cash and stock, and has also
announced the acquisition of Continental Water Systems Northwest
(1521 15th St. NW, No. 2, Auburn, WA 98001; Tel: 206/850-0100).

Jet Tech expects revenues of about $16 million for the 1995
calendar year.  In addition to having installed over 400 systems in
the US, Jet Tech has a significant international base of customers,
especially in Puerto Rico and Mexico.  And Jet Tech's 30,000 sq.
ft. Edwardsville facility will complement U.S. Filter's already
strong design/build capability in the wastewater business.

Jet Tech designs and manufactures SBRs (sequencing batch reactors)
and ATADs (autothermal thermophilic aerobic digesters) with high-
efficiency air diffusion and mixing to enhance the biological
destruction of organic wastes.  Treating sludges and other
biosolids this way enables them to be used for land applications or
landfilling without restrictions.

Terms for U.S. Filter's acquisition of Continental Northwest were
not disclosed.  The company had been a U.S. Filter franchised
dealer for several years.  Continental Northwest sells and services

Praxair and CBI
Set Merger

Praxair, Inc. (39 Old Ridgebury Rd., Danbury, CT 06810; Tel:
203/794-3000, Fax: 203/794-6056) and CBI Industries, Inc. (800
Jorie Blvd., Oak Brook, IL 60521-2268; Tel: 708/572-7000) disclosed
that they have signed a definitive merger agreement in which
Praxair will purchase all outstanding common shares of CBI for
$33.00 per share in cash.  The Boards of Directors of both
companies have unanimously approved the agreement.  To complete the
transaction, Praxair stated it intends next  week to amend its
tender offer commenced on November 3, 1995 to  increase its
offering price to $33.00 per share.  Consummation of the tender
offer is subject to terms and conditions to be set forth in the
tender offer.

H. William Lichtenberger, Praxair's chairman and CEO, announced
that the strategic fit between the two companies will lead to
greater sales growth, lower costs and a wider array of products,
applications and technologies.  CBI's chairman and president, John
E. Jones, added that CBI shareholders will be well-served by this
merger agreement since Praxair's position as a world leader in
industrial gases will strengthen CBI's global operations and
present its employees with significant new opportunities.

Anxiety among CBI's work force spread after CBI's board accepted
the $33-per-share takeover offer from Praxair.  Although Praxair
officials have said nothing about employment at CBI, they have said
they wanted CBI solely for its Liquid Carbonic division, which
makes carbon dioxide for soft drinks.  It is expected that Praxair
will probably dispose of CBI's two other units, the Chicago Bridge
& Iron contracting division and the Statia Terminals oil storage
subsidiary.  Combined, the two groups account for slightly more
than half the company's 15,000 employees.

CBI's top five executives could walk away with $21.6 million in
golden parachutes.  The severance payments represent two-thirds of
the $34.6 million in profits the company reported for the first
nine months of this year.  Jones, who was paid nearly $1.1 million
in salary and bonuses last year, owns 71,776 shares of stock now
worth about $2.3 million. According to the company's annual proxy
statement, he will receive $9.6 million as a result of the merger.
Lewis E. Akin, executive VP in charge of Chicago Bridge & Iron, has
a  golden parachute worth $4.3 million and Liquid Carbonic chief
Calvin E. Willoughby will get $3.4 million.

Praxair is the largest industrial gases company in North and  South
America, and one of the largest non-cryogenic gas companies
worldwide. 1994 sales were $2.7 billion.  The company produces,
sells and distributes  atmospheric, process and specialty gases,
and high-performance  surface coatings.

Culligan Acquires
Bruner Corp.

Culligan Water Technologies, Inc. (One Culligan Pkwy., Northbrook,
IL 60062; Tel: 708/205-6000) has acquired the Bruner Corp. (500 W.
Oklahoma Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207; Tel: 414/747-3700, Fax:

Understanding
Filtrate Flux

Toshiro Murase, Than Ohn and Katumi Kimata of Nagoya University
(Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Nagoya, Japan) studied the
crossflow MF characteristics of dilute suspension, which produce a
highly compressible fouling cake-layer and/or a highly viscous
filtrate, under constant pressure.  Their findings are reported in
Journal of Membrane Science [108, 121-128, 1995).

Crossflow operation is being used more and more to achieve
efficient performance of membrane separations.  The most serious
operational constraint in industrial use is the flux decline caused
by membrane fouling.  Over the last decade, much research has been
carried out to investigate the microfiltration (MF) mechanisms
underlying the crossflow membrane modules.

Several models which evaluate the transient and steady-state flux
during crossflow MF have been studied based on the assumption of
the incompressibility of the fouling layer and the rigidity of
suspensoids.  Also, for fully understanding the effects of process
parameters on the flux decline, an experimental study of membrane
fouling and permeate flux has been presented recently.

The characteristics of dynamic MF with a rotating cylinder or disk-
shaped medium has been examined for remarkably reducing membrane
fouling suing low compressibility suspended solids as experimental
materials.  In areas such as biotechnology, food engineering, and
sewage treatment, however, it is known that the hydraulic
resistance of the fouling layer to permeation shows a heavy
dependence on the operating pressure, and the compressibility of
the deposits become an important factor for evaluating the flux
decline during crossflow operation.

The Nagoya research found that even when the ceramic membrane used
has a much smaller pore size than the particle size of the
suspended solids, the crossflow MF process of dilute suspension
generally consists of two stages--media filtration at an earlier
stage and thin-cake filtration at a later stage.  With the PMMA
material having an average particle size of 7.0 micron, the medium
filtration period expands with decreasing solids concentration.

When the filtration variables, such as the solids concentration and
the filtration pressure, pass a critical level the medium
filtration period ceases, and thin-cake filtration covers the whole
process after the operation starts.  Its equilibrium flux can be
related to a number of operating variables in terms of a few
parameters including both the shear stress acting on the cake
surface and the Ruth's filtration coefficient.  Referring to this
empirical correlation, it becomes evident that, due to the effects
of the crossflow stream on the internal structure of fouling-layer,
the high cake-compressibility yields a remarkable decrease in the
steady flux.

Treatment Softens
Regulatory Burden

Increasingly, nanofiltration is being used to soften water in
Florida, particularly for applications where the feed water has
high color and dissolved organics (which are precursors to
regulated disinfectant byproducts).  Robert Bergman of CH2M Hill
(7201 N.W. 11th Pl., Gainesville, FL 32605; Tel: 904/331-2442, Fax:
904/331-5320) has undertaken a cost comparison study between
membrane and lime softening, and the results reported in
Desalination [102, 1995, 11-24, 1995].

In Florida, about 87% of public water supplies are derived from
groundwater.  Commonly, these water supplies are classified as
being "hard," that is, having relatively high concentrations of
calcium.  Many of these supplies also have substantial dissolved
organic color, hydrogen sulfide, and iron.

Until about 10 years ago, essentially all municipal groundwater
treatment plants in Florida practicing softening used the lime
process and, in many cases, relatively high dosages of chlorine for
disinfection and "bleaching-out color."  With the onset of more
stringent drinking water standards, particularly for disinfectants
and disinfectant byproducts, and the development and
commercialization of nanofiltration membranes, new softening plants
in the state have favored membrane softening over lime in treating
colored groundwater.

In fact, Florida water utilities are the world leaders in
nanofiltration application in terms of installed capacity.
Nanofiltration is a physical barrier treatment process that
separates harness ions, dissolved organics, and total dissolved
solids from water.

Bergman's inquiry showed that lime softening plant costs were lower
than membrane softening throughout the entire range, but the
relative difference in costs decreased with larger facilities.  For
15 mgd plants, the lower range of the membrane softening plant
costs is only about 10% greater than for lime softening plant
costs.  For any specific application, both softening technologies
should be considered, at least for initial feasibility analysis.
Furthermore, if additional treatment processes (such as ozone) are
added to lime softening to produce water quality comparable to
membrane softening permeate (with lower color and THMFP), membrane
softening can have lower construction costs than lime softening.

Lime softening (alone) is generally less expensive than membrane
softening, assuming no bypass/blending and a 100% plant operating
factor.  As plant capacities increase, the relative costs between
the two processes decrease.  Generally, membrane softening O&M
costs are about 15% greater than lime softening O&M costs.

Again, if additional treatment processes are added to lime
softening to match the better membrane softening permeate water
quality, or if some water can be bypassed around the membranes and
blended to produce the finished water (thus taking advantage of the
superior water quality from the membrane process), membrane
softening can be less expensive than lime softening.

Bergman found that the slightly higher costs for membrane softening
over lime softening are more than justified for many utilities that
desire the superior product water quality.

Osmonics Removes
Hazardous Radiation

The use of nanofiltration has solved a nuclear wastewater disposal
problem for a hazardous waste remediation company.  The company was
contracted to process nearly 400,000 gal. of water contaminated
with radioactive material.  The liquid waste contained
approximately 10% dissolved salts and other chemicals in addition
to the radioactive contaminants.

Traditional ion exchange and adsorption techniques had not been
effective at removing the radioactive material and reverse osmosis
membrane processing was not a viable option due to the excessive
osmotic pressure caused by the high salt concentration.

Osmonics (5951 Clearwater Dr., Minnetonka, MN 55343; Tel: 612/933-
2277, Fax: 612/933-0141) manufactured a crossflow membrane system
with nanofiltration membrane elements which passed a high
percentage of the salts while retaining most of the radioactive
material.  By passing a majority of the salts, the osmotic pressure
effect was negated, allowing  a successful application.

Modular Nozzle
for Hollow Fibers

Brown University Research Foundation (Providence, RI ) scientists
Frank Gentile, Michael Lysaght, and Nicholas Warner have invented
a new piece of apparatus for making hollow fibers (U.S. Patent
5,480,598).

No matter what the particular application of the hollow fiber
vehicles, the morphology and thickness of the fiber membrane must
be controlled to obtain the desired mechanical and transport
properties suitable for the particular application.  The
conventional synthetic-fiber spinning methods that can be used to
produce hollow-fiber membranes: 1) melt spinning; 2) dry spinning;
3) wet spinning; and 4) a combination of dry and wet spinning.  In
each of these methods, a tubular cross-section of the hollow fiber
is formed by delivering a spinning material such as a polymer,
copolymer, cellulosic material, or the like, through a spinneret
nozzle while simultaneously delivering a material to be housed in
the core of the fiber.

Some of the problems associated with these prior art nozzle
assemblies and hollow fiber forming techniques include an inability
to form fibers from highly viscous thermoplastic polymers due to
nozzle clogging, an inability to adjust the nozzle assembly to
produce varying membrane thicknesses and morphologies, an inability
to change nozzle types or nozzle caps in the assembly so as to
allow for the production of different types and shapes of hollow
fibers, and an inability to produce Z-fibers having trabeculae
oriented substantially longitudinally within the fiber wall and
substantially interconnected with one another within the fiber
wall.

The Brown University invention describes a nozzle assembly for
forming hollow fibers, particularly a "Z-fiber" with longitudinally
oriented trabeculae with the fiber wall. The nozzle assembly
contains a replaceable nozzle cap, a replaceable seal-guide, and a
retractable central bore used to supply core material for the
hollow fibers. The Z-fibers are particularly useful in enabling
cells, solutes, or the like, to enter the fiber wall and move
longitudinally into the center of the fiber wall.

Blotting Stain
Is Reversible

A new reversible protein blotting stain from Sigma Chemical Co.
(P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, MO 63178; Tel: 800/325-3010) provides
sensitivity and low background for blotting nylon, nitrocellulose,
and PVDF membranes as well as PAGE gels. Blotting is a useful tool
for quickly screening complex mixtures of proteins and peptides.
The probes for detecting the molecule of interest are labeled;
ether radiolabeled, biotinylated, or enzyme-linked.

Western blotting involves transferring proteins onto a
semipermeable membrane, either directly from solution or after
electrophoresis on polyacrylamide.  The membrane is probed with a
protein-specific primary antibody, then an enzyme-conjugated
secondary antibody.  A chromogenic substrate for the conjugated
enzyme develops color only where the specific protein is found on
the membrane.

In order to determine protein purity, a second visualization
method-a general protein stain-is needed, and that requires
duplicate gels.  However, correlation of bands on duplicate gels is
often difficult.  It would be useful to be able to stain the
overall protein pattern and then immunostain the same blot.  For
such an application, the general protein stain must be sensitive
and reversible and have low background binding to many membrane
types.

If the immunostain recognizes only the native protein, the general
stain should leave the protein undernatured.  It is best that the
stain not contain highly toxic components, so handling and disposal
would be simpler and safer.

Sigma's new protein stain, a metal chelate called RPRO-B, meets
these criteria.  This stain is suitable for nitrocellulose, nylon,
and PVDF membranes as well as PAGE gels.  Destaining is a mild
procedure requiring only an EDTA solution, and the sensitivity and
specificity of immunostaining afterward are usually unaffected.

Membranes are stained with the Sigma product by soaking at room
temperature for about 3 minutes.  Polyacrylamide gels should be
fixed first, stained with RPRO-B for 40 minutes, then destained in
the fixing solution.  Brilliant Blue R remains the stain of choice
for permanent staining of proteins on PVDF membranes and
polyacrylamide gels.  But for reversible staining, and for staining
all common membrane types as well as PAGE gels, Sigma's RPRO-B
deserves a closer look.

Whither Seawater
Desalination?

Great things have been predicted for seawater desalination in the
U.S., but have more or less failed to materialize.  Gordon Leitner
of Leitner and Associates, Inc. (815 Shadow Lawn Dr., Elm Grove, WI
53122; Tel: 414/782-5236) has explored the question of what
actually happened to this technology in Desalination [102, 199-
207,1995].

Installed seawater desalting capacity in the 50 states of the U.S.
is currently 13 mgd.  Only 3 mgd is produced on a regular basis,
with the rest of the installed capacity on standby.  This is a
minuscule percentage of ambitious projections that were made 25
years ago.  It is also well below the projections being made just
3 years ago.

The 1992 IDA Worldwide Desalting Plants inventory lists eight
seawater desalting plants proposed projects within the continental
limits of the U.S. with a total capacity of 67 mgd.  Not one of
these proposed plants is currently under active consideration as of
this writing.  Another plant not included on the list was under
active consideration until early 1994, after which the project was
shelved.

To begin with, Leitner says that the forecasts of 30 years ago, as
well as more recent forecasts, have been fraught with outside
influences that had a dynamic effect on the market place.  While
the changes in this small industry covered a longer span than the
growth of the computer, they confirm a common truism-even the
wisest sage could not have predicted the changes that have
occurred.

Water conservation and reuse were not given much consideration 35
years ago.  The mindset of the U.S. in the 1960s was not thinking
of conservation.  The mindset changed.  During the most recent 5-
year California drought, conservation and water management efforts
are credited with reducing water delivery by 15% or more.  The
treatment and recycling of municipal wastewater has increased
significantly over the past decade in California and in some
coastal states and will continue to do so.  There are more than 200
reclamation facilities in California alone, treating over 400,000
acre feet of municipal wastewater a year-about 5% of urban
deliveries.

Leitner believes the U.S. will have municipal seawater desalination
plants only when the need is accurately demonstrated.  When this
occurs, there is substantial evidence that an 80-100 mgd seawater
RO plant can be build in the U.S., and when operated in conjunction
with a combined cycle electric power plant, will deliver water at
the plant site at a cost in the range of $2.00 per 1000 gallons
(1994 dollars).

In the author's opinion, there is less evidence that the large
vertical tube multi-effect distillation plant being studied by the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California can do the same,
but the work carried out to date suggests the efforts be continued.

Leitner suggests that the industry needs to be alert to
opportunities, in particular when privatization might lead the way
to lower costs.  In addition, industry must continue to search for
innovative ways to lower costs, including the effect of blending
with other sources.  Municipalities interested in seawater
desalination should be guided to an awareness that a water
transport pipeline is always too large when first installed and
most always too small in later years.

With modular seawater desalination units, added construction can be
carefully tuned to demand increases.  Industry needs to emphasize
that rates for conventional supplies will double this decade.
Seawater desalination costs should hold steady with improved
technology.

Performance Is
in the Design

According to Weir Westgarth, a leader in desalination technology,
speaking at the IDA World Congress on desalination and water
services in Abu Dhabi in November, RO seawater desalination plants
can perform successfully and reliably if designed conservatively
and operated properly.

RO plants have been criticized for not meeting some customers'
expectations, particularly in the Persian Gulf region.  RO has been
promoted as having a lower capital cost than an equivalent capacity
thermal plant.  Westgarth, presenting a paper co-authored by Alan
Linstrum, Peter Nicoll, George Mulholland, and Tom Leith, said that
while first cost is important, other considerations have to be
taken into account when assessing through life cost-particularly
reliability, design, operating costs, and the experience of the
consultant and desalination contractor.

Environmental conditions are seldom considered in the case of RO,
and this was cited as probably the most important aspect of
selection.  Ideally, small prototype pilot units should be built on
all sites intended for large RO installations at least 1.5 years
before the full size plant design is required.  This would be used
to test and optimize conventional pretreatment options to handle
the large swings in water quality that can occur in shallow, warm
coastal sea water. The performance of different membrane types
under varying environmental conditions should be studied.

A comparison carried out of MSF and RO technology concluded that
for large multi-million gallon installations in the Gulf, thermal
plants provide the best technology for combined power and water
schemes.  While RO has the lowest capital and operating costs,
these types of plants in the Gulf are subject to some of the most
arduous feedwater conditions in the world-the MSF process is not so
susceptible to these conditions.

More realistic replacement rates of membranes, based on actual
operational experience, should be considered when evaluating
product water costs at the early stages of the project. Real
replacement rates are a major factor influencing life cost
assessment.

Westgarth concluded that both MSF and RO have a role to play in
meeting the future needs of customers for desalinated water.
Looking at the pros and cons of both systems, the authors found
that RO has a shorter construction period, initially lower capital
costs, and more flexible operation.  MSF water was of a higher
quality, was unaffected by suspended or biological matter, and the
system became more efficient and productive in colder winter
months.

Materials Influence
Adsorptive Fouling

The hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of membrane materials have
an important influence on the membrane flux reduction when treating
solutions containing hydrophobic solutes.  Different methods of
measuring the hydrophobic properties of membranes have been
evaluated, with measurement of the contact angle being the most
commonly used method.

Journal of Membrane Science [108, 79-87,1995] reports on a study in
which the flux reduction of eight membranes of approximately the
same cut-off, but of different materials, was determined and
related to the contact angle by Catharine Jnsson and Ann-Sofi
Jnsson of Lund University (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, P.O. Box
124, S-221 00 Lund, Sweden).

Low-molecular weight hydrophobic solutes, such as fatty acids,
alcohols and alkanes, are found in many natural solutions treated
by ultrafiltration (UF).  Although the concentrations of these
substances are usually low, they can reduce the membrane flux
severely. The flux of polysulfone membranes with a nominal
molecular weight cut-off more than 100 times greater than the
molecular weight of the solute was significantly reduced when
treating an octanoic acid solution, and surfactants, many times
smaller than the membrane pores, were found to reduce the flux of
microfiltration membranes.

The Jnssons found that the flux of the hydrophilic membrane was
only marginally reduced, whereas the flux reduction of hydrophobic
membranes was significant.  Membranes of polyvinylidene fluoride
had the lowest flux reduction of the hydrophobic membranes.
Differences between membranes of the same material
(polyethersulfone), but from different manufacturers, were
observed.  No relation was found between the flux reduction and the
contact angle of the membrane, the initial pure water flux or the
retention of a hydrophilic macromolecule (PEG20).

The pure water flux of two of the hydrophobic membranes increased
significantly during the experiments, whereas the pure water flux
of the other hydrophobic membranes decreased.  A membrane of
polyaramide, with a contact angle of the same order of magnitude as
the other hydrophobic membranes, behaved as a hydrophilic membrane,
with no influence on the flux at concentrations below the
solubility limit of the hydrophobic solute, but experienced the
most severe flux decline of all the membranes included in the
investigation at the solubility limit.

Two modified membranes were included in the investigation.  The
flux reduction of the these membranes was not significantly lower
than for the corresponding unmodified membranes of the same
materials.

Pall Researches the
Wet-Dry Reversible

Pall Corp. (2200 Northern Blvd., East Hills, NY 11548; Tel:
516/484-5400, Fax: 516/484-5228) has developed integrity-testable,
wet-dry-reversible ultrafiltration membranes.  For the first time,
ultrafiltration/diafiltration membranes are capable of excluding
0.02 micron diameter, monodisperse, latex particles.  The membranes
can be dried without loss of ultrafiltration properties. A rapid,
reliable method for integrity testing membranes also has been
developed. The test has particular applicability to ultrafiltration
membranes, although it may also be used for testing microfiltration
membranes (U.S. Patent 5,480,554).

Two general structural varieties of asymmetric, integrally-skinned,
phase inversion UF membranes are known. The original and still most
commonly encountered variety of UF membrane consists essentially of
a bilayer having a thin skin exhibiting what has been termed slit-
like fissures or cracks, and a thick substructure containing a high
concentration of finger-like intrusions or macrovoids. The
macrovoids often extend from one surface to the other although they
are sometimes buried more deeply within the matrix. Ideally, an
integral skin covers the macrovoids, but in practice, some of the
skin above the macrovoids may be cracked. Cracks break the
integrity of the skin and enable the passage of large particles.
These membranes are supplied wetted with a pore supporting fluid
since they cannot tolerate full dryness without severe loss of
filtration performance.

Bacteriostats, which must be washed out of the membrane before
usage, are often present in membranes that are supplied wet. Some
manufacturers indicate in their catalogs that a membrane is being
supplied "dry," however, these membranes may contain humectants
such as glycerol as a pore supporting fluid. As with bacteriostats,
humectants must be removed from the membrane by soaking, flushing
or by some other method that never permits the membrane to become
fully dried.

The second general type of UF membrane purportedly produces
integrally-skinned membranes with macrovoid-free matrices by
increasing the viscosity of the casting solution through the
addition of water soluble viscosity enhancing polymeric additives
such as PVP or PEG. These membranes exhibit a skin with a pore size
distribution which is too broad to be integrity-tested because of
the leaching of the polymeric additives during precipitation and
washing steps.

These membranes can be supplied "dry" (i.e., no free liquid
present), but contain high concentrations of residual PVP or PEG.
Humectants such as glycerol, PVP, PEG and/or water and other
wetting fluids may act as plasticizers to diminish friability.
These materials may also act as pore supporting fluids which if
removed lead to cracks and other defects in the membrane skin.

Because of the wide and large number of applications for
ultrafiltration membranes, considerable effort has been spent to
improve the effectiveness of such membranes, but to date, with
limited success. Many patents and articles have been published
regarding the manufacture of ultrafiltration membranes, some
claiming them to be "defect-free," and some claiming them to be
dryable, but the fact remains that no ultrafiltration membrane has
heretofore been produced that is both dryable and which is free of
defects.

In  the Pall testing method, referred to as the KUF method, the
test membrane is thoroughly wetted with a wetting liquid. A
displacing liquid is placed in contact with one side of the wetted
membrane and increasing pressure is applied to the displacing
liquid. The flow rate through the membrane is measured as a
function of the applied pressure.

The displacing liquid is substantially insoluble in the wetting
liquid and the interfacial tension between the two liquids is about
10.0 dynes/cm or less. A plot of the flow rate of liquid, per unit
area of the membrane, through the membrane as a function of applied
pressure can be made and a straight line may be drawn through the
steep part of the resulting curve, using regression analysis, which
will intersect the horizontal axis at a given pressure value, which
is then the KUF value.

Irradiation Forms
Better Bioreactor

Scientists at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX
77058; Tel: 713/483-3809, Fax: 713/244-8452) have built an improved
bioreactor for growing mammalian cell cultures.  Such bioreactors
can be used to support the growth of dense volumes of mammalian
cells by providing ample, well distributed flows of nutrient
solution with minimal turbulence.  Such gentle nonturbulent flow
environments in the growth media are necessary because mammalian
cells are relatively delicate and cannot withstand the shear forces
present in turbulent flows.

The new bioreactor, reports Glenn F. Spaulding, may be made from
polymers such as polystyrene or polypropylene by inexpensive
injection molding or vacuum forming techniques.  Conventional units
are machined and assembled using more expensive materials such as
zirconium, stainless steel, acetal, and polycarbonate.  The
cylinder walls in the new bioreactor are typically one millimeter
(mm) thick.  The pores are formed by rotating the vessel about its
cylindrical axis by exposing it to a beam of neutrons, protons,
electrons, or other particles.  The impinging particles drill
straight holes through both the inner and outer cylinder walls,
forming pores with diameters of 5-20 microns located about 50
microns apart.

In a typical growth procedure, mammalian cells and beads, which
serve as a substrate on which the cells grow, are placed in the
vessel.  Fresh culture medium is also injected and air bubbles are
removed to eliminate head space in the vessel.  The vessel is then
rotated until the beads and cells are uniformly distributed.
Periodically during the growth process, half the medium is removed
and replaced, and the proportion of glucose in the fresh solution
is gradually increased to meet the demands of the growing culture.
The culture is removed when the cellular aggregates have grown
large enough to be useful for research--usually 100-1,000 microns.

Like other bioreactors developed for this purpose, the NASA product
is cylindrical.  In operation, it is rotated slowly about its
cylindrical axis in a horizontal position.  The new bioreactor
differs from its predecessors in the manner in which it supplies
oxygen to and removes waste gases from the cells and nutrient
medium.  In older units, this job is accomplished with the help of
pumps and the ancillary plumbing and rotating couplings, which
supply pressurized air to cylindrical core perfusion membranes.
The new bioreactor functions without any connected plumbing and can
be rotated on any standard laboratory bottle roller.

The NASA bioreactor consists of integrally molded concentric
cylinders with a connecting wall at one end and a tightly fitting
cap at the other.  Syringe ports in the cap are used to introduce
nutrient medium and cells into the vessel and to remove excess air
bubbles and spent medium.  Small pores are in the inner and outer
cylinder walls and form membranes which permit oxygen to diffuse
into the vessel and waste gases to diffuse out.  The pores are
small enough, though, to prevent the nutrient medium and cells from
leaking out.  The effective surface area of the membranes in the
new units is 2-10 times as large as in the older units.

Toray Creates
Antithrombotic

Researchers at Toray Industries (2-1, Nihonbashi-Muromachi 2-chome,
Chuo-ku, Tokyo 130 Japan) have synthesized a hydrophilic material
and a formed a semipermeable membrane from that material (U.S.
Patent 5,480,953).

When membranes are used for medical care and brought into contact
with blood or body fluid, their components such as platelets,
leucocytes, erythrocytes and fibroblasts inevitably adhere, and
there are fears that these adhered components generate a thrombus
on a surface of a membrane coming into contact with blood and that
the components affect a complement. As a result, formation of a
thrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to be
caused.

Various attempts to solve these difficulties have been made. In
synthesizing a hydrophilic copolymer containing a polyalkylene
oxide chain, copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester,
the content of polyalkylene oxide in the copolymer can be too high,
and there is a problem that the synthesized copolymer becomes a gel
in spite of the kind of the acrylic or methacrylic ester used. The
gel can hardly be dissolved in a solvent. In such a case, it cannot
be used as a coating material and cannot be formed as a fiber or a
membrane.

Even if the content of polyalkylene oxide is low, a satisfactory
anti-fouling property and antithrombotic property have not been
demonstrated. Research to improve the gel structure, a polymer,
which can be easily dissolved in a solvent, which has a high water
content and which has a high affinity with acrylic ester or
methacrylic ester, was synthesized by copolymerizing an acrylic
ester or methacrylic ester, polyalkylene oxide and another
copolymerizable component.

The material developed is characterized as a copolymer composed of
a monomer with a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizable
carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylic ester
monomer or an acrylic ester monomer and a monomer with a
polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond other than the first two
monomers, and the content of the monomer is not less than 5% by
weight and not more than 90% by weight.

The hydrophilic material can be dissolved in a solvent and has
excellent antithrombotic and anti-fouling properties, and provides
an antithrombotic semipermeable membrane. These materials can be
appropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent and
anti-fouling materials.

The field of membrane separation technology is in a state of rapid
growth and innovation.  Many different membrane separation
processes have been developed during the past half century and new
processes are constantly emerging from academic, industrial, and
governmental laboratories.  Membrane Separations Technology:
Principles and Applications, edited by R.D. Noble and S.A. Stern
(Elsevier Science B.V., publisher), presents the basics on a
variety of membrane separation processes from the unique
perspectives of investigators who have made important contributions
to their fields.

Significant improvements are being made in many aspects of membrane
separation technology-in the development of new materials with high
selectivity and permeability, in fabrication methods for high-flux
asymmetric or composite membranes, in membrane module construction,
and in process design.

Contributing authors include William Eykamp (microfiltration and
ultrafiltration), M.H.V. Mulder (polarization phenomena and
membrane fouling), Ed Cussler (membrane contractors), and Robert
Spillman (economics of gas separation membrane processes).  The
