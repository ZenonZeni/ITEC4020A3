<H2>Congress Appropriates Additional Funding For Housing</H2>
<H4>by Andrew Sperling, NAMI Director Of Public Policy
</H4>
</font>
<hr>

	As part of the recently enacted 1997 budget for the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Congress began 
the process of funding replacement housing resources for people 
with disabilities who are likely to be harmed by recent changes in 
the law that allows an increase in "elderly only" housing 
designations.  For fiscal year 1997, Congress appropriated $50 
million for tenant-based rental assistance for people with 
disabilities who are adversely affected by "elderly only" housing 
designations.
<P>
	As a result of Congressional changes enacted in 1992 and 
expanded in 1996, public-housing authorities (PHAs) and assisted-
housing providers now have tremendous freedom to exclude non-
elderly people with disabilities by designating buildings and 
developments as "elderly only."  Such "elderly only" housing 
designations are expected to have a devastating impact on the 
availability of decent, safe, and affordable housing for people 
with disabilities.  While the law does contain certain protections 
for current lease-compliant tenants, people with disabilities on 
public and assisted-housing waiting lists are particularly 
vulnerable--especially people with severe and persistent mental 
illness who already face stigma and discrimination both in public 
housing and the private rental market.  This erosion of housing 
resources is compounded by recently enacted changes that repeal 
federal preferences in tenant-selection policies and place tight 
restrictions on eligibility for individuals with a history of 
substance abuse.
<P>
	The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) housing 
task force estimates that by the year 2000 there will be a decrease 
of at least 273,000 units that would otherwise have been occupied 
by non-elderly people with disabilities in the absence of "elderly 
only" housing designations.  This $50-million allocation (estimated 
to fund as many as 10,000 one-year certificates and vouchers) will 
not come close to meeting the increase in demand for affordable 
housing expected over the next few years.  However, it does amount 
to the first time that Congress has recognized the need to make 
replacement resources available for the disability community.  The 
$50-million appropriation was included in the HUD budget through 
the efforts of Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and 
Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and John Kerry (D-MA).   
<P>
	Even with this modest infusion of new resources, the public 
mental health system is likely to face greater difficulty trying to 
cope with the loss of affordable housing.  As Congress moves to 
devolve responsibilities for housing programs to state and local 
governments, state mental health agencies (SMHAs) and local mental 
health authorities will need to intervene with state housing-
finance agencies and PHAs at the community level to ensure that 
people with brain disorders have a voice in local planning 
decisions.  
<P>
	While the 104th Congress did not follow through on proposals 
to abolish HUD as a federal agency, the department's budget was cut 
by nearly 20 percent (down to $20 billion).  In addition, other 
important changes were made that have moved the federal government 
almost completely out of the business of producing new housing 
units and further away from any role supervising how federal funds 
are allocated at the local level.  Thus, these modest increases in 
funding for housing for people with disabilities are an important 
accomplishment for disability advocates. 
<P>
	The expanded authority for PHAs to designate housing as 
"elderly only" was contained in a bill signed by President Clinton 
in March 1996 extending the authority for certain expiring HUD 
programs.  A separate bill reforming public housing programs by 
converting numerous federal programs into block grants died in a 
House-Senate conference committee immediately prior to final 
adjournment.  Nevertheless, the next Congress is expected to 
continue to push toward consolidating federal housing programs and 
passing the responsibility for housing policy down to state and 
local government.  For example, homeless-service programs under the 
McKinney Act are likely to be block-granted and could be cut below 
their current level of $823 million (after having been cut by 
nearly $300 million over the past two years).  
<P>
	Another important program serving the housing needs of people 
with brain disorders is Section 811.  Since 1994, the Section 811 
program has been cut by nearly $40 million, down to its current 
level of $194 million.  (The Section 811 program funds capital 
advances and project-based certificates for non-profit groups that 
serve the housing needs of people with disabilities.)  Congress 
also granted HUD new authority to transfer up to 25 percent of the 
funds appropriated under the 811 program to tenant-based rental 
assistance.  This change is designed to allow HUD to fund roughly 
the same number of units (2,915) as it did in 1995 and 1996.       
<P>
 	While these new housing resources for people with disabilities 
are a positive development, the long-term trend for solutions at 
the federal level is not encouraging.  As with all other 
discretionary programs within the federal budget, HUD funding will 
be facing severe constraints over the next five to seven years.  
If, as expected, the HUD budget is further squeezed between now and 
the year 2000, responses to the housing crisis facing people with 
disabilities will have to come through creative approaches at all 
levels.  
<P>
	Beyond Section 811 and Section 8 certificates and vouchers for 
people with disabilities, there are other federal resources that 
SMHAs and local mental health authorities can tap.  The Low-income 
Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the Community Development Block 
Grant (CDBG) programs both enjoy broad bipartisan support in 
Congress, and their funding is likely to remain stable.  Both 
programs are administered by state housing finance authorities and 
state and local economic development agencies rather than by HUD.  
Thus, SMHAs and their allies in the provider community as well as 
families and consumers can play an important role in deciding how 
these resources are spent at the community level.  State and local 
officials that administer programs such as LIHTC and CDBG must go 
through a planning process and a local housing assessment that 
require a survey of the housing needs of people with disabilities 
and input from concerned parties.  Proactive engagement on the part 
of the entire mental health community with state housing finance 
authorities and local economic development officials will help 
ensure that resources keep pace with increased demand for housing. 
<P>
    	Finally, the public mental health system must look toward 
creative solutions at the local level and through partnerships with 
the private sector.  Increasingly, managed care firms that have won 
contracts to serve clients in the public mental health system are 
investing resources in community-based housing.  While some states 
have included housing or residential services in contracts, many 
managed care firms view access to decent, safe, and affordable 
housing as an important part of preventing expensive inpatient 
hospitalization.
