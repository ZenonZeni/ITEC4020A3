<B>Does anyone have experience or thoughts on ICSI with sperm from HIV+ males?</B><p>

     You ask about the risk of transmitting HIV by ICSI. Here is some 
general information.  Both free HIV and cell-associated virus  is found in 
semen.   The virus is not found in the DNA of the sperm.  Sperm preparation 
procedures to separate the sperm from the seminal plasma have been used in 
order to reduce the risk of transmission.<p>
     Whether any virus is carried into the uterus by adhering to the sperm 
surface is a concern.  Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Neisseria 
gonorrhoea and Ureaplasma urealyticum do attach to sperm so this mode of 
pathogen transport is not uncommon.  Since sperm may express HIV gp120 
receptors (Ashida & Scofield, 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 84, 3394), it 
is reasonable to postulate that the virus might adhere to spermatozoa.<p>     Artificial insemination has resulted in seroconversion of some women 
(Stewart et al., 1985, Lancet II, 581-2) but insemination with washed 
samples has been reported to be safe.  Insemination of 29 women resulted in 
17 pregnancies and no infections (Semprini et al., 1992,Lancet 340, 
1317-19).  However, virus shedding into the ejaculate depends on many 
factors and no PCR studies have yet been published to define whether virus
was 
present in the ejaculate and was absent after sperm preparation for 
artificial insemination.<p>
     Adherence of HIV to spermatozoa may occur but it is probably not a 
major factor in heterosexual transmission.  You may want to read one of my 
reviews on sexual transmission:<p>
