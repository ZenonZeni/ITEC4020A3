FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY:  WHO DOES WHAT IN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-19A and GAO/RCED-91-19B
Pages:  32 and 119

Today's federal food safety and quality regulatory system is
fragmented and complex, consisting of as many as 35
different laws and involving 12 federal agencies. The first
volume of this report provides an overall perspective on
federal efforts to ensure food safety and quality. GAO
discusses (1) the statutory responsibilities, programs,
activities, staffing, and budget of the federal agencies
involved with food safety and quality; (2) the inter-agency
agreements used by the agencies to cooperate in meeting
their statutory duties; (3) the ways in which funding and
staffing levels have changed during the 1980s relative to
the agencies' work loads; and (4) the issues that federal
officials believe will be critical for food safety and
quality in the 1990s. The second volume contains a more
detailed description of the food safety and quality
activities of the 12 agencies that were the focus of the
first volume. These 12 agencies include the following: Food
and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control
(HHS); Agricultural Marketing Service, Federal Grain
Inspection Service, Food Safety and Inspection Service,
Agricultural Research Service, and Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (USDA); the Environmental Protection
Agency; the National Marine Fisheries Service (Department of
Commerce); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(Department of the Treasury); U.S. Customs Service; and
Federal Trade Commission.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE:  STRATEGIC MARKETING NEEDED
TO LEAD AGRIBUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-22
Pages:  46

GAO found that U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies
rarely use strategic marketing--a range of practices that
identify consumer needs and develop products and delivery
systems to satisfy those needs--to help U.S. agribusiness
better compete in both export and domestic markets. Although
USDA agencies are reacting positively to some of the
challenges of strategic marketing, GAO concludes that
overall the Department is not prepared to guide agribusiness
in a market-driven economy. Important marketing policies,
practices, and skills are lacking within individual
agencies, impairing USDA'S ability to fulfill a leadership
role. For example, three of the four agencies GAO examined
do not coordinate their program planning or systematically
exchange information.  These factors have contributed to
USDA's inability to develop a plan for marketing as a
coordinated, Department-wide issue under the new management-
by-objective system.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE:  FARM AGENCIES' FIELD
STRUCTURE NEEDS MAJOR OVERHAUL

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-9
Pages:  60

The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs its farm programs
and services through one of the federal government's largest
and most decentralized field structures. This structure also
dates to the 1930s and reflects the more limited
transportation and communication systems in use at that
time. Given changing patterns in American agriculture and
mounting constraints on federal spending, GAO looked for
ways to improve the overall management of USDA's field
structure. GAO found that USDA can save millions of dollars
while maintaining or improving operational effectiveness by
(1) more aggressively pursuing incremental improvements
through field office collocations and consolidations and (2)
restructuring to provide a more flexible, integrated field
organization GAO notes the likelihood of many sources of
opposition to the restructuring of USDA field operations. As
a result, USDA Will need to engage its grass roots staff,
top management, farm clients, and Congress in updating its
current structure to one that can effectively deliver
services into the next century.

THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1991:  SCORING OF GSA LEASE-
PURCHASES

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-44
Pages:  7

This report discusses differences in how the Office of
Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office
did budgetary scoring for lease-purchase contracts at the
General Services Administration. OMB'S treatment produced
higher outlay estimates for fiscal year 1991 than did CBO'S.
GAO believes that the key to resolving the issue would be
for the administration and Congress to reconsider the matter
in light of a common set of assumptions about the contracts'
financing and the required scoring rule. GAO understands
that the administration will be initiating discussions with
Congress to develop a mutually acceptable
way of resolving the issue.  GAO believes that this is an
appropriate course of action.

BUDGET ISSUES:  EFFECTS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 1990 SEQUESTER

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-21
Pages:  20

This report examines the effects of the fiscal year 1990
sequester on five federal agencies  the Department of Health
and Human Services, IRS, the Department of Education, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. GAO found that the 1990
sequester had only a minimal effect on the five agencies.
The five agencies actually lost less than 1.4 percent of
their final budget authority because (1) growth in agency
appropriations offset sequester reductions and (2)
appropriations enacted after the sequestration were
partially exempt from that process. As a result, agencies
absorbed the sequester reductions by postponing program
expansions and improvements rather than by cutting core
services. Final 1990 figures peg the deficit at $220.4
billion, or $120.4 billion over the target level. Had OMB
predicted the need for a $120 billion sequester in its
earlier sequestration reports, GAO believes that meaningful
nonsequester deficit reduction might have been achieved in
the face of massive, across-the-board cuts. GAO continues to
believe that sequestration alone will not eliminate the
deficit. Instead, a combination of good faith negotiations,
political leadership, and compromise on difficult policy
matters is needed.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:  OVERSIGHT OF BLOCK GRANT MONITORING
NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-23
Pages:  14

Local governments rely on the Community Development Block
Grant program to help meet locally defined community
development needs, including the creation of decent housing
and the expansion of economic opportunities. However, the
Office of Inspector General found that many problems plagued
the administration of grantees' programs. GAO reviewed three
Department of Housing and Urban Development field offices
(Baltimore, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; and Detroit, Michigan)
to determine how they monitored entitlement grantees of
Community Development Block Grants. GAO found that
weaknesses in HUD'S guidance for monitoring entitlement
grantees may have contributed to inadequate supervisory and
evidentiary control practices.  Without adequate supervisory
and evidentiary controls over its monitoring program, HUD
cannot ensure that management problems are detected or t hat
staff do not duplicate previous work. In addition, without
using information found in Office of Inspector General
reports when planning their monitoring, field offices may
not be using their limited resources most effectively.

STAFFORD STUDENT LOANS:  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOANS
AWARDED TO INELIGIBLE BORROWERS

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-7
Pages:  32

Due to internal control weaknesses, GAO has cited the
Stafford Student Loan Program, the largest government
program for student loans, as one of 14 areas at high-risk
for mismanagement, fraud, and abuse. A main problem at the
Stafford Student Loan Program is the lack of an information
system to protect the government's interests; in fiscal year
1990, more than half the program's funds--$2.4 billion--were
used to repay defaulted loans. Today the Department is
running a multi-million-dollar, commercial-type loan
operations with a data system containing incomplete,
inaccurate, and unreliable information. Consequently, the
Department has no way of knowing whether (1) student loan
defaulters are trying to obtain new loans or (2) borrowers
have exceeded legal loan limits. GAO found that loan
defaulters may have obtained about million in new loans, and
that students have received million of dollar in loans over
the legal limits. While the total impact of such abuses is
unclear because the data are so poor, GAO believes that a
significant problem exists--one that is costing the federal
government millions of dollars in interest subsidies and
additional defaulted loans. The Department of Education
plans to install a new data base in 1993. Until then GAO
believes that the Department needs to do much more to (1)
improve the accuracy and completeness of the current data
base and (2) make this information available to guaranty
agencies. GAO concludes that much is at stake. If the abuses
go unchecked, they will continue to corrode the financial
aid system and ultimately deprive eligible students of the
money they need to finance their education.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:  IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN ENFORCING HEALTH
INSURANCE CONTINUATION REQUIREMENTS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-37
Pages:  12

GAO reviewed the Department of Labor's and the Internal
Revenue Service's enforcement of the health insurance
continuation requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). This legislation
requires firms employing 20 or more employees and offering a
group health insurance plan to provide employees and their
families the option of continued coverage in cases of job
loss, death, or divorce. This report discusses (1) Labor and
IRS efforts to help private individuals who bring cases of
alleged noncompliance by employers to their attention, (2)
procedures for investigating these allegations, and (3)
enforcement history. Both IRS and Labor provide information
about COBRA to those who inquire, and Labor will contact
employers to help employees obtain benefits. However, if
employers refuse to provide benefits, IRS cannot and Labor
generally does not try to force employers to provide
benefits. Further, the extent of COBRA violations is
unknown. IRS' method of dealing with potential COBRA
beneficiaries, in GAO'S view, discourages the reporting of
violations. GAO believes that Labor and IRS should do more
to ensure that IRS is made aware of potential COBRA
violations. The knowledge that excise taxes may be assessed
for these violations could deter such violations. Also,
people referred by IRS to Labor could get help quicker if
they were given Labor's phone number along with its address.

JOB TRAINING PARTNERSHIP ACT:  REVIEW OF AUDIT FINDINGS
RELATED TO THE DOWNRIVER COMMUNITY CONFERENCE PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-90-105
Pages:  22

GAO initially looked at four expenditures made by the
Downriver Community Conference--an organization that
provides employment training to residents in the Detroit
area--under the Job Training Partnership Act  (1) $151,824
for contractual services to create a data base to be used to
identify potential program participants, (2) $47,740 for a
sole source contract with a computer consultant, (3)
$100,226 for the purchase of an air-conditioning system, and
(4) a $4,725 payment to a terminated employee. While GAO
concluded that these expenditures represented an allowable
use of funds, concerns were raised that GAO had not fully
developed and considered the evidence of wrongdoing or
misuse of funds in connection with these expenditures.  In a
supplement addressing these concerns, GAO notes that it did
find evidence that some local Downriver rules were violated
and that available evidence provides a basis to question the
wisdom and prudence of some of Downriver's actions. However,
GAO did not find sufficient evidence of fraud or other
improprieties to warrant further inquiry or referral  to the
Department of Justice.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD:  ACTION NEEDED TO IMPROVE
CASE-PROCESSING TIME AT HEADQUARTERS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-29
Pages:  72

The National Labor Relations Board generally considers cases
involving either allegations of unfair labor practices or
disagreements about elections on union representation. In
response to concerns about the length of time it has taken
to decide some cases appealed to the headquarters Board from
the regional offices, GAO looked at the Board's system for
deciding cases. This report (1) describes how long the Board
had taken to decide cases, particularly since 1984, and
determines whether  there were any excessive delays; (2)
identifies factors that contributed to such delays; and (3)
determines if additional administrative or legislative
action might be warranted.

LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS:  STRIKES AND THE USE OF STRIKE
REPLACEMENTS IN THE 1970S AND 1980S

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-2
Pages:  24, Jan. 18 (24 pages).

The 1980s experienced about half as many strikes as did the
1970s.  Among strikes reported to the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service in 1985 and 1989, GAO estimates that
employers announced an intention of hiring permanent
replacements about one-third of the time and actually hired
them in 17 percent of the strikes. GAO found  little
difference in the use of permanent strike replacements by
employers  in larger versus small strikes. Many employers
and union  representatives involved in strikes in 1985 and
1989 believe that permanent strike replacements were more
common in the late 1980s than in the late 1970s. However,
GAO estimates that--had it surveyed all employers and union
representatives--about one-third of employers and 13 percent
of union representatives would have said that they had no
basis for providing an opinion on trends in the hiring of
permanent replacements.

OIL RESERVE:  SOME CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT SPR DRAWDOWN AND
DISTRIBUTION

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-16
Pages:  40

The crisis in the Persian Gulf has renewed interest in the
ability of the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to counter disruptions in the supply of oil to the
United States. To provide this protection, DOE must be able
to offset the supplies lost by quickly drawing down reserve
oil from its storage sites and distributing it to
purchasers.  This report (1) reviews DOE'S current and
planned capability for removing oil from reserve sites and
getting it to users via oil distribution networks,(2)
examines the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's compliance with
pipeline safety requirements, and (3) discusses DOE'S
efforts to correct problems that GAO previously reported.
GAO concludes that a major distribution could be hampered
because buyers of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil are
required to use U.S.-flag tankers to ship the oil between
U.S. ports.  DOE and industry officials doubt whether enough
U.S.-flag vessels are available to do the job, and questions
remain about the efficiency of procedures to authorize the
use of foreign vessels.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT:  DOE NEEDS TO BETTER IMPLEMENT CONFLICT-
OF-INTEREST CONTROLS

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-15
Pages:  34

DOE has 22 federally funded research and development centers
that are managed and run by private corporations and
universities under contracts with DOE. In fiscal year 1989,
DOE paid these contractors almost $8 billion these
contractors, in turn, awarded about $3.2 billion to
subcontractors. In response to concerns about subcontractor
conflicts of interest, GAO looked into the situation and
found that while DOE'S written policies and procedures
provide guidance on how to spot and avoid conflicts of
interest among subcontractors, DOE field offices have not
been implementing these internal management controls.
Contrary to DOE regulations the DOE Albuquerque field office
abdicated responsibility and allowed the research centers to
make conflict-of-interest determinations themselves.
Although GAO was unable to determine whether DOE'S policies
and procedures were, in practice, effective, GAO noted two
management control problems. First, Albuquerque has relied
extensively on subcontractor self-certification in making
conflict-of-interest decisions even though certifications
may not always be accurate. Second, Albuquerque's
documentation of conflict-of-interest decisions is limited.
GAO also found that neither Albuquerque nor DOE headquarters
exercised effective oversight to ensure that conflicts of
interest were avoided in the subcontracts awarded by the Los
Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories.

OBLIGATIONS LIMITATION:  RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION'S
COMPLIANCE AS OF JUNE 30,1990

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-41
Pages:  20

This quarterly report examines the Resolution Trust
Corporation's compliance with the maximum obligation limit
set forth in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989. The act provides a formula for
calculating the limit and sets aside $50 billion in
financing to resolve troubled savings and loans placed into
conservatorship or receivership. On the basis of its review
of RTC'S September 28,1990, report and schedule and its
financial records, GAO concludes that none of the categories
for the formula were omitted from RTC'S calculation and that
there is little risk that RTC exceeded the limitation.
However, RTC is facing a funding crisis. Without enough
money to absorb the losses and to buy the assets of failed
institutions, RTC will have to slowdown its resolution
efforts. As a result, failing institutions will continue to
incur operating losses, thereby increasing resolution costs.
GAO believes that only quick action to identify a long-term
solution to RTC's funding needs will ensure the
Corporation's continued ability to respond to the thrift
crisis. GAO also followed up on recommendations it made to
RTC in its first quarter report and found that RTC is, in
all instances, making progress on the recommendations,
although none have been fully implemented yet.

RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION:  UNNECESSARY LOAN SERVICING
COSTS DUE TO INADEQUATE CONTRACT OVERSIGHT

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-19
Pages:  8

GAO found that from January to July 1990, the Resolution
Trust Corporation might have avoided as much as $1 million
in loan processing costs resulting from continued operations
at a large loan processing center in Orlando, Florida. These
unnecessary costs arose from inadequate RTC oversight,
insufficient RTC and North Carolina National Bank of Florida
initiatives to plan for a large reduction in the number of
loans processed at the center, insufficient cost information
on center operations, and RTC's failure to take early action
to market the center.  Given the thousands of assets in
RTC's current real estate inventory, GAO believes that the
Florida situation highlights the urgent need for timely and
adequate contractor monitoring efforts.

FINANCIAL AUDIT:  AIR FORCE'S BASE-LEVEL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-26
Pages:  24

This report presents of the results of GAO's review of the
Air Force's base-level financial management operations for
fiscal years 1988 and 1989. Base-level managers are
responsible for million of dollars in appropriations and
accountable assets. However, accounting errors and
inaccurate financial reports pervaded the base-level
accounting systems at the 17 bases where GAO conducted its
tests. For fiscal years 1988 and 1989 combined, GAO
identified over $2.7 billion in adjustments needed to
correct errors in year-end, base-level trial balances. This
inaccurate information had already found its way into
financial reports delivered to the Department of Defense,
the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the
Treasury, and Congress. Real property account balances were
misstated because transactions were recorded in an
inaccurate and timely manner. Unauthorized and excessive
issues of inventory and equipment diminished accountability
for those items, and the failure to match personnel and
inventory payroll records created an opportunity for
unauthorized payroll transactions.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT:  INS LACKS ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS
OVER ITS RESOURCES

Order No.:  GA0/AFMD-91-20
Pages:  34

Over 40 years ago, Congress required each federal agency to
establish and maintain adequate systems of accounting and
internal control. However, GAO found that because of an
outmoded accounting system, poor internal controls, and lack
of management emphasis on financial management--weaknesses
that have gone uncorrected for years--the Immigration and
Naturalization Service continues to lack fiscal
accountability over its resources. INS could lose millions
of dollars in revenue because accurate and reliable
financial information is unavailable to effectively bill,
collect, or litigate amounts owed the government. Further,
INS' primary accounting system contains incomplete and
inaccurate financial data. GAO concludes that solving INS'
financial management problems will take strong management
commitment and leadership that must be sustained across
succeeding administrations.

INSPECTORS GENERAL:  WORK PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

Pages:  15

The Office of Inspector General audits and investigates
program agencies at the Department of Labor. It also
investigates allegations of racketeering. During fiscal
years 1988 and 1989, both the Office of Audit and the Office
of Investigations spent a majority of their time and
resources investigating projects at the Employment and
Training Administration and at the Employment Standards
Administration. Most of the investigations done by the
Office of Investigations centered on alleged criminal
activity in Labor programs. The Office of Labor Racketeering
classified more than half of the racketeering cases open
during fiscal years 1988 and 1989 as involving employee
benefit plans. GAO was told that all of the Office's cases
investigated during the past two years involved alleged
racketeering or related criminal activity. The Office
pursued all of its cases under criminal statutes except for
two cases pursued under the civil provisions of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act.

IMMIGRATION MANAGEMENT:  STRONG LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
REFORMS NEEDED TO ADDRESS SERIOUS PROBLEMS

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-28
Pages:  111

The Immigration and Naturalization Service is faced with
balancing the demanding roles of enforcement and service. On
the one hand, INS enforces laws meant to prevent the illegal
entry of millions of poverty stricken, often repressed
people naturally drawn to a better life in the United
States. On the other hand, INS facilitates legal immigration
by processing millions of requests relating to citizenship
and asylum and by inspecting hundreds of millions of people
at ports of entry. This report, one in a series of general
management reviews of major federal departments and
agencies, concludes that over the past decade weak
management systems and inconsistent leadership at INS have
allowed serious problems to go unresolved. As a result, the
agency has degenerated into a group of segmented autonomous
programs, each trying to handle its own set of problems with
little attention to their interrelatedness. Compounding this
lack of overall direction is a chaotic budget development
process that has produced budgets that are simply
compilations of program submissions with little
accountability for funds or attention to agencywide
priorities. The current INS organizational structure, marked
by complicated lines of authority and communication, adds to
and perpetuates the agency's segmented management. Although
lNS' problems did not happen overnight, the agency needs to
take immediate action to improve both enforcement and
service operations. In the long run, the Department of
Justice and INS must articulate a vision of how INS is to
effectively implement the nation's immigration policy.

POSTAL SERVICE:  CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE--EXPRESS AND
PRIORITY MAIL TRANSPORTATION

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-13
Pages:  4

GAO reviewed the Postal Service's award of an express and
priority mail transportation contract to Air Train, Inc.
(later renamed Emery Worldwide Airline, Inc.) and the
contractor's performance under that contract.  The contract
says that the minimum acceptable performance for meeting
express and priority mail delivery times at destination
cities is 98 percent of the time. GAO found that after the
initial start-up week, the on-time performance requirement
was met for 54 of 57 weeks. In addition to the on-time
requirement, the contractor is expected to deliver all
express and priority mail to destination cities without
leaving any mail behind, either at the originating city or
at the hub (where the mail is sorted). GAO found that Air
Train failed to meet these standards 10 out of 57 weeks.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT:  INHERENT WEAKNESSES MAY LIMIT
ITS USEFULNESS FOR SMALL GOVERNMENTS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-16
Pages:  23

Have federal agencies been sufficiently analyzing the effect
of their proposed regulations on small governments (towns
with less than 50,000 inhabitants)?  Further, has the goal
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980--to reduce
regulatory burdens on small businesses, small governments,
and nonprofit organizations--been met for small governments?
GAO found that federal agencies are not doing as many
analyses for small governments as they might, largely
because of weaknesses in the act. First, the Small Business
Administration may be unable to monitor compliance with the
act because it lacks expertise in small government issues.
Second, that act has no provisions for ensuring federal
agency compliance. Third, neither the act nor SBA has
provided criteria or definitions for determining whether
federal rule-making agencies are conducting sufficient
analyses of regulations affecting small governments and how
these analyses should be done. GAO is concerned that
proposed legislation--S. 1758, the Small Governments
Regulatory Partnership Act--would not address these
weaknesses. GAO believes that SBA should develop the
expertise needed to better implement provisions relating to
small governments.  GAO also believes that Congress may wish
to consider amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act to
require SBA, in consultation with OMB, to develop criteria
on whether and how federal agencies should conduct analyses
for small governments.  It should also consider expanding
SBA'S existing authority to review and comment on proposed
agency regulations affecting small governments. This
expansion should direct SBA to work with OMB to ensure
agency compliance with the provisions of the act.

MAJOR ISSUES FACING THE 102ND CONGRESS

Order No.:  GAO/T-OCG-91-1
Pages:  19

GAO'S 1988 transition series sought to alert the President-
elect and the new Congress to the many challenges facing the
nation. This testimony updates the status of the issues GAO
cited in 1988.  The Comptroller General first reviews the
overall state of the economy and the budget, cautioning that
a protracted war in the Middle East, the recession at home,
and further increases in the cost of deposit insurance could
trigger another explosive rise in the deficit over the next
several years; the general fund deficit--excluding the
surpluses in the Social Security and other trust funds--
already appears likely to top $400 billion in 1991.  He then
discusses critical policy problems in the following program
areas:  defense, the financial sector, health,
transportation, agriculture, energy, the environment,
financial management, and the public service. In some cases
GAO reports significant progress, but that is the exception.
Many of the problems, including some of the most important
ones like the thrift crisis, have become more severe. Given
the rapid developments in international affairs--as
evidenced by changes in the Warsaw Pact countries and by the
economic and political integration of Western Europe--the
Comptroller General believes that it is time to revisit the
question, What is required of our government?  If the United
States is to succeed in this new world order, the
Comptroller General believes that several prerequisites must
be satisfied.  First, we must have a government that works,
one that operates efficiently and effectively, both in its
internal functions and in its delivery of services to the
American people.  To reach that goal, investment in
government, its people, its facilities, and its technology
is needed.  Second, we must have a government whose
financial performance relates properly to the national and
world economy.  For that to be achieved, the United States
must move toward a long term fiscal policy that recognizes
the need for a much higher level of national savings.
Third, we must have a financial system in whose safety and
soundness the American people can have complete confidence,
so that our market economy can effectively allocate capital
to the most productive uses.  To accomplish that, we must
resolve the thrift crisis, restore the soundness of the
banking industry, and ensure an efficient and effectively
regulated structure of capital markets.

MEDICAID:  LEGISLATION NEEDED TO IMPROVE COLLECTIONS FROM
PRIVATE INSURERS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-25
Pages:  32

As a public assistance program, Medicaid was expected to pay
for health care only after Medicaid recipients had used all
their other health care resources.  GAO found that two major
problems hinder states from collecting from private insurers
for recipients' covered health care costs.  First, states
cannot prohibit some out-of-state insurers from trying to
avoid paying state Medicaid agencies for such costs.  States
now lack jurisdiction over insurers that operate only
incidentally in the state.  Second, states' limited
authority over plans covered under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) does not allow them to
prohibit these plans from trying to avoid payments for
recipients' covered costs.  Further, many states have not
exercised the authority they do have to mandate that no
ERISA plan include any contract provision that might limit
or exclude payments for Medicaid recipients' health care
costs.  While  state officials found it hard to pinpoint
losses resulting from their payment systems, examples of
state Medicaid losses obtained by GAO suggest that the
problem may be substantial--perhaps millions of dollars in
losses each year--and growing.  To minimize future losses,
federal legislation is needed to clarify Medicaid's role as
a payer of last resort and to enhance the ability of states
to collect from out-of-state insurers and ERISA plans.

VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-38
Pages:  31

The current ways of resolving medical malpractice claims in
this country are neither efficient nor equitable.  Claims
take a long time to be resolved, awards and settlements are
unpredictable, and legal costs are steep.  Concern about the
existing system has inspired alternative proposals for
claims resolution, including fault-based and no-fault based
approaches.  This report looks at one of the fault-based
alternatives-the Michigan Medical Malpractice Arbitration
Program. GAO assessed (1) the extent of hospital, health
care provider, and patient participation under the Michigan
plan; (2) the arbitration alternative's effect on medical
malpractice claims resolution; and (3) whether arbitration
contributed to reducing medical malpractice insurance costs.
GAO'S conclusions about the program are limited because
program participation has been low. GAO does not foresee
significant increases in program participation because of
the voluntary nature of the program and because of the lack
of incentives for patient participation.

MEDICARE:  MILLIONS IN POTENTIAL RECOVERIES NOT BEING SOUGHT
BY MARYLAND CONTRACTOR

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-32
Pages:  9

As part of a broader GAO effort to evaluate the adequacy of
the Medicare contractor budget for claims-processing and
program safeguard activities, GAO discovered a situation
that it believes warrants congressional attention. GAO found
that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland--a Medicare
claims-processing contractor--has paid at least $8.8 million
in claims for which it has identified other health insurers
that may have primary payment responsibility under the
Medicare secondary payer provisions.  In this case, the
contractor--through its investigative efforts--has
identified other parties that may owe Medicare sizable sums.
However, the contractor lacks the resources to recover these
amounts. GAO concludes that any additional funding of the
contractor's activities to recover these payments may yield
considerably more than each dollar so expended.

SOCIAL SECURITY:  ANALYSIS OF A PROPOSAL TO PRIVATIZE TRUST
FUND RESERVES

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-22
Pages:  40

This report analyzes a proposal by a Member of Congress to
create a new system of individual Social Security accounts.
Under this proposal, the accumulating reserves of the Social
Security Trust Fund would be returned to workers and
invested in individual accounts in the private sector, where
they would be held until the workers' retirement.  In
effect, the proposal would partially and temporarily
privatize Social Security.  GAO found that the proposal
could be integrated with the existing progressive benefit
structure and, given favorable financial market conditions,
could improve retirement incomes.  If implemented, the
Individual Social Security Account may change the mix of
public and private saving but not necessarily the magnitude
of national saving.  The proposal also raises many
administrative difficulties and policy issues that need to
be addressed before Individual Social Security Accounts
could be considered a fully working alternative to the use
of trust fund reserves.

SOCIAL SECURITY:  PRODUCTION INITIATIVES IN OHA'S REGION V
COMPLY WITH LAW AND GUIDELINES

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-36BR
Pages:  24

Persons denied Medicare and Social Security benefits may
appeal such decisions to Administrative Law Judges in 132
hearing offices around the country. The Social Security
Administration's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is
responsible for managing these judges.  GAO reviewed
productivity initiatives underway in OHA'S Chicago Regional
Office and found that they complied with Administrative
Procedure Act and OHA guidelines.  GAO also found that by
including dispositions of regional chiefs and retired judges
in hearing office statistics, average production figures for
the Chicago region and some hearing offices were slightly
overstated.  However, in terms of distribution of monetary
awards, the only apparent gain from the overstatement was
that one hearing office received an additional $3,529 for
awards and bonuses to support staff for which it would not
have been otherwise eligible. As OHA studies and redesigns
its system of productivity measures for its Administrative
Law Judges, it should ensure that whatever measurement
system it designs fairly recognizes the work done by
individuals and by offices.  In the interim, GAO believes
that when calculating the productivity of its hearing
offices, OHA should count regional chiefs and any retired
judges as resources for those hearing offices that received
credit for their dispositions.

TAX SYSTEM MODERNIZATION:  STATUS OF IRS' INPUT PROCESSING
INITIATIVE

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-9
Pages:  34

Through its input processing initiative, IRS is attempting
to drastically reduce manual handling of paper income tax
returns, tax payments, and other tax information. The
initiative--part of IRS' overall effort to modernize its tax
processing system--is intended to speed the way tax
information is fed into computers for processing.  This
report describes the status of the three major components
designed to automate the labor-intensive aspects of entering
tax return and other information into IRS computers. GAO
identifies each component's anticipated costs, expected
benefits, and progress toward implementation, as well as
issues requiring further attention by IRS.

ADP BUDGET:  POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE'S BUDGET REQUEST

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-17BR
Pages:  26

To assist Congress in its continuing oversight
responsibilities, GAO reviewed the Department of Defense's
fiscal year 1991 budget request for information technology
resources.  GAO identified potential reductions of $460.1
million--$72 million from the Army, $74.1 million from the
Air Force, $14 million from the Defense Logistics Agency,
and another $300 million from DOD'S operation and
maintenance request.  These potential reductions are based
on GAO'S assessment of budget justifications, schedule
slippages, and program changes. This report also provides
information on DOD'S Corporate Information Management
initiative.

COMMAND AND CONTROL:  DEFENSE'S USE OF ENGINEERING
CONTRACTORS FOR ACQUIRING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-19
Pages:  17

The Department of Defense relies on both in-house and
outside technical expertise to design and develop highly
complex command, control, communications, and intelligence
systems.  This report examines the extent to which DOD uses
engineering support contracts for advice and direction in
acquiring automated data processing systems.  DOD data show
that from fiscal years 1985 through 1989 show that DOD spent
about $3.4 billion for engineering and technical support of
system acquisitions.  Air Force was by far the largest user,
accounting for over $2 billion of the $3.4 billion spent.
DOD'S annual expenditures went from $494.5 million in fiscal
year 1985 to $891.7 million in fiscal year 1989, an 80-
percent increase.

MAINFRAME PROCUREMENTS:  STATISTICS SHOWING HOW AND WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS ACQUIRING

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-13
Pages:  32

GAO has previously issued a series of 10 reports on
compatible computer procurements.  Those reports looked at
those agencies that obligated $50 million or more for
mainframe computers and mainframe peripheral acquisitions.
This capping report provides consolidated statistics on
mainframe computer and mainframe peripheral procurements by
35 federal agencies. In particular, GAO looked at the extent
to which the 35 agencies required compatibility with IBM or
other equipment manufacturer. GAO found that during the 3-
1/2 fiscal years ending in March 1989, the agencies
obligated $1.9 billion for mainframe and mainframe
peripheral procurements.  Eighty-two percent ($1,587.8
million) of all the procurements required compatibility with
existing systems. IBM-compatible procurements comprised 64
percent of the compatibility-limited procurements and 52
percent of all procurements. With a 47 percent share of the
total federal market, IBM was the largest vendor; Unisys,
with a 20-percent share, was the next largest. Almost 60
percent of the total value of all procurements involved only
one vendor.  When GAO used the number of procurements--
rather than dollars--for comparison, it found that the
agencies had 3,225 procurements for mainframe and mainframe
peripherals and over 90 percent required some kind of
compatibility. The agencies required IBM compatibility 60
percent of the time. When IBM compatibility was required,
IBM equipment was supplied 68 percent of the time.

INTERNATIONAL BANKING:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL
ADEQUACY STANDARDS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-80
Pages:  41

Concerned that banks may not be holding enough capital to
ensure their safety and soundness, Congress passed
legislation in 1983 encouraging other countries to maintain
or improve banks' capital bases.  In 1988 the Basle
Committee on Banking supervision, which included
representatives from 12 nations, adopted a framework to
measure capital adequacy and to establish minimum capital
standards for banks operating internationally.  Included in
the framework are minimum capital adequacy standards that
are to be fully achieved by the end of 1992.  This report
looks at (1) steps regulators and financial institutions are
taking to implement the framework, (2) progress made toward
meeting the framework's objectives, and (3) issues that
remain unresolved in implementing the framework.  GAO
reviews implementation in the United States, France,
Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

The Panama Defense Force headquarters, located in the El
Chorillo District in Panama City, was a major target during
the December 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama.  During the
fighting, about 2,200 households in the El Chorillo district
were uprooted.  This briefing report (1) assesses the living

U.S. FOOD EXPORTS:  FIVE COUNTRIES' STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES
FOR TESTING PESTICIDE RESIDUES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-90
Pages:  26

The 1989 controversy over Alar, a substance applied to
apples, intensified public fears about the use of pesticides
and chemicals on produce.  Concern about food residues has
also spread overseas and has led to losses in U.S.
agricultural exports.  This report discusses (1) U.S.
government efforts to prevent or resolve trade disputes
arising over pesticide use; (2) specific procedures used by
foreign governments in selected Pacific Rim countries and
Australia to set tolerances and test for pesticides on U.S.
produce exports; and (3) the technical capabilities of these
foreign governments to conduct pesticide testing.  To
evaluate testing and technical capabilities, GAO visited
Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. GAO
found that the five countries lack information about which
pesticides and other chemicals are being used on U.S.
produce. Further, while the five countries have the
necessary testing capabilities, they use a variety of
standards in testing for pesticides

U.S. EMBASSY, MOSCOW  ALTERNATIVES FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
THEIR COSTS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-43FS
Pages:  3

Using Soviet construction workers, the United States began
building a new embassy in Moscow in 1979. By the mid-1980s,
it was discovered that the building was riddled with Soviet
eavesdropping devices, and construction was halted. This
unclassified version of a classified report looks at the
State Department's proposal to demolish the unfinished
embassy and to rebuild atop the old foundation. GAO
discusses (1) the basis for the current cost estimate of
$270 million for demolition and reconstruction and (2) the
alternatives considered by the State Department for a new
embassy in Moscow and their costs. GAO is concerned that the
State Department's estimates for demolition and rebuilding
may be too low. Regardless of which option is eventually
funded, GAO notes that construction agreements with the
Soviets are still pending for the new office building and
for other land and buildings in adjacent sites. Further
delays in concluding these agreements could affect
construction costs and schedules.  In addition, State has
not prepared cost estimates on the additional property and
facility needs for the Moscow complex.

Drug interdiction programs established by the Coast Guard,
Customs Service, and Border Patrol, with support provided by
the Department of Defense, are designed to stop smugglers
and/or their shipments by focusing on the mode of
transportation. These efforts are thus referred to as land,
marine, air, and commercial cargo interdiction programs. GAO
examines (1) the available measures of drug interdiction
program performance and whether performance can be compared
between different programs, (2) funding for the interdiction
programs, (3) quantities of drugs seized through the

ACQUISITION REFORM:  DEFENSE MANAGEMENT REPORT SAVINGS
INITIATIVES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-11
Pages:  18

The 1986 Packard Commission made many recommendations for
improving operations at the Department of Defense. In
response, DOD developed the Defense Management Report, which
outlines steps to improve DOD management. GAO found that DOD
has implemented several Defense Management Report savings
initiatives and has begun to realize some savings, but the
larger, more complex initiatives are still in the planning
stages. To fully implement the initiatives and achieve DOD'S
savings goal, GAO believes that continued management support
is necessary. Although the initiatives were estimated to
save about $39 billion over fiscal years 1991-95, these
estimates did not always rely on cost analyses supported by
historical facts or empirical cost data. GAO'S review of
$24.5 billion in estimated savings showed that about 82
percent of these savings were based primarily on management
judgment, suggesting that the reliability of the estimates
may vary.  DOD officials said that current budget
negotiations and international security developments--
including Operation Desert Shield--will not delay the
implementation of the efficiencies to generate these
savings.  As of June 1990, none of the Packard Commission's
recommendations to streamline and reduce the acquisition
work force had been made; in fact, the number of acquisition
personnel increased slightly. DOD estimates that over fiscal
years 1991-95, Defense Management Report initiatives will
eliminate almost 2,400 civilian and almost 2,000 military
positions from the acquisition work force. The fiscal year
1991 National Defense Authorization Act, however, requires
much deeper cuts in acquisition and headquarters personnel.

DEFENSE MANAGEMENT:  EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE ACQUISITION
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-15
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed the military services' efforts to streamline
their acquisition management structure in accordance with
DOD'S 1989 Defense Management Report, which was issued in
response to the Packard Commission's 1986 recommendations.
The Packard Commission concluded that DOD acquisition
management had become so encumbered and unproductive that
weapons systems frequently cost more than planned and took
too long to develop and deliver. GAO found that--as
prescribed in the Defense Management Report--each military
service has revised (1) its three-tier structure and (2) the
roles of its materiel and systems command. GAO believes that
these revisions, if fully implemented as intended will more
clearly separate the streamlined acquisition structure from
the service's existing structure by (1) appointing Service
Acquisition Executives and Program Executive Officers who
are devoted full-time to acquisition matters, (2) giving
three-tier officials more control over acquisition matters,
and (3) removing unnecessary review layers from the
acquisition process. Until DOD issues guidance on
implementing the Defense Management Report changes and the
services update their policies and procedures, GAO cannot
determine whether or not DOD'S management accountability
goal will be fully achieved.

ARMY ACQUISITION:  AIR DEFENSE ANTITANK SYSTEM DID NOT MEET
OPERATIONAL TEST OBJECTIVES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-51
Pages:  19

The Army selected its current line-of-sight forward heavy
air defense system--known as the "Air Defense Antitank
System"--in November 1987 to provide needed air defense to
the maneuver force. However, GAO found that operational
testing did not demonstrate that the system was
operationally suitable. The system fell far short of its
availability requirements, in large part because many system
components were unreliable, and many effectiveness
requirements were not met. While the Army acknowledges the
system's problems, it believes that the system has
demonstrated sufficient operational effectiveness to warrant
continuation of the program. In August 1990, the Army opted
to defer production of the system for two years in hopes of
resolving the system's problems. Because the system has not
proven that it can meet established requirements, by law the
Army cannot obligate any procurement funding after fiscal
year 1989 until the system meets or exceeds the Army's
operational test performance criteria.

MILITARY EXPORTS:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENT OFFSET
LEGISLATION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-13
Pages:  8

Offsets are a range of industrial and commercial
compensation practices required by foreign governments and
firms as conditions for the purchase of military exports.
There is a growing perception that offset arrangements erode
the U.S. industrial base as technology and component
production is transferred to foreign sources to satisfy
offset commitments. This report looks at steps taken by the
executive branch to (1) establish a comprehensive U.S.
policy on offsets addressing technology transfer, U.S.
financing of offset arrangements, and the effects of offsets
on specific subsectors of the U.S. industrial base; (2)
negotiate with foreign governments to limit the adverse
effects of offsets; and (3) require U.S. industry to notify
DOD of offset arrangements exceeding $50 million.

WEAPONS PRODUCTION:  IMPACTS OF PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES ON
AIRCRAFT UNIT COSTS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-12
Pages:  12

GAO reviewed the sensitivity of estimated procurement costs
of selected military aircraft programs to reductions in
numbers of aircraft purchased each year. Aircraft
procurement unit costs generally increase as their
procurement rates decrease. However, some mature Air Force
and Navy procurement programs, including those for the KC-
135R engine modification, F/A-18, F-16, AV-B, and F-15 would
not show as significant a unit cost increase as other
aircraft programs if their procurement rates were cut.
According to contractors, the procurement unit cost of some
mature aircraft is less sensitive to procurement rate
reductions when at least one of the following factors is
present  (1) contractors have a chance to manage overhead
and other costs in anticipation of production rate changes,
(2) foreign customers' requirements can offset reductions in
the U.S. procurement quantities, and (3) multiyear
procurement can be used to stabilize prices over a longer
production period. Contractors also said that unit cost is
especially sensitive to sudden unanticipated changes in
production rates. In GAO'S view, these circumstances
underscore the importance of program stability. When
procurement rate decreases are necessary, contractors should
be given enough advance notice so they can eliminate
unnecessary facility, overhead, and other costs before the
production rate decreases begin.

TEST AND EVALUATION:  THE DIRECTOR, OPERATIONAL TEST AND
EVALUATION'S CONTROLS OVER CONTRACTORS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-60
Pages:  17

The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, uses
contractors to assist with the operational test and
evaluation of major weapon systems. Concerns have arisen
that some of these contractors may have a conflict of
interest; that is, they could be assessing the operational
testing of the very weapon systems that they had helped to
develop. This report (l) describes the nature and extent of
the Director's management controls over contractor support,
including measures to address possible conflicts of interest
under omnibus contracts; (2) provides GAO'S views on the
Director's use of Federally Funded Research and Development
Centers, particularly the Institute for Defense Analyses;
and (3) determines the Director's use of the Institute
during fiscal years 1987 through 1989 and identifies any
possible conflicts of interest and the Institute's controls
to avoid such conflicts.  While the Director's policies and
procedures for managing contractors comply with existing
guidelines, GAO is concerned that the Institute is not now
required to disclose to the Director possible conflicts of
interest arising either from its work for no organizations
responsible for system acquisitions and development and
testing or from its use of consultants.

Concluding that several military aircraft accidents were
caused by poor quality fasteners, the Air Force made the
testing specifications for class 3 threaded fasteners more
stringent. GAO found that the Air Force followed applicable
DOD guidance in making the change. To implement the more
stringent testing specifications, the Air Force and the Navy
procured a specific gage--called an indicating gage--that
analyzes deviations in fastener threads. When procuring
these gages, the Air Force and the Navy followed competitive
procurement practices specified in DOD regulations and the
Competition in Contracting Act.

BIOLOGICAL WARFARE:  BETTER CONTROLS IN DOD'S RESEARCH COULD
PREVENT UNNEEDED EXPENDITURES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-68
Pages:  20

The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972, which
prohibits development, production, and stockpiling of
biological and toxin weapons, counts over 100 nations among
its signatories. Yet the number of countries having or
suspected of having biological programs has more than
doubled since then. Starting in fiscal year 1984, Congress
began appropriating funds--$370 million so far--for the
development of countermeasures to defend against a
biological weapons attack. However, GAO found that the Army,
lacking adequate internal controls in its medical research
program, unnecessarily spent funds on research and
development efforts that did not address validated threats
and may have duplicated the research efforts of other
federal agencies.

Pages:  58

To accommodate a growing tourist industry and to promote
economic development, Guam wants to expand its international
airport onto property occupied by the U.S. Naval Air Station
Agana. The government of Guam has asked the United States
many times to transfer the station facilities and land to
its control. This report looks at (1) the feasibility of
relocating Agana operations to Andersen Air Force Base,
Guam; (2) the estimated costs of such a relocation; (3) the
potential costs of making enough Navy land available at the
Air Station to expand the international airport and related
facilities without relocating all of the Navy's operations.
GAO concludes that while it is possible to consolidate Navy
and Air Force operations at Andersen Air Force Base, it
would take over 100 years to recover the costs of relocating
the Navy's operations. Although not endorsing any approach,
GAO outlines four options that would allow the airport to
expand without requiring the Navy to relocate. Navy and Guam
officials, however, have expressed concerns about each of
these options and have said that none would fully satisfy
their needs.

MILITARY BASES:  PROCESS USED BY SERVICES FOR JANUARY 1990
BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT PURPOSES

The fiscal year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act
established a new, independent commission to evaluate DOD'S
base closure and realignment proposals, and DOD must
reevaluate its January 1990 candidate bases against criteria
yet to be established. This report provides information on
DOD'S processes before passage of the act. GAO discusses (1)
how DOD had selected the domestic military bases announced
as candidates for disclosure and realignment by the
Secretary of Defense in January 1990 and (2) whether the
military services had developed realistic cost estimates for
closing and realigning the forces at those bases.  GAO found
that DOD did not provide specific written guidance to the
services on how to choose bases for closure and realignment.
Instead, the Secretary of Defense spoke to the services in
general terms, instructing them to consider anticipated
force structure and budget reductions in selecting candidate
bases. In selecting candidate bases, none of the services
used a process as comprehensive and well documented as the
one followed by the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and
closure.  Further, the processes used by the services in
selecting bases for closure varied.  The Navy did not
develop cost and savings estimates prior to the Secretary's
January 1990 announcement, and the Army and Air Force cost
and savings estimates were only preliminary; efforts to
refine these estimates were suspended with passage of the
fiscal year 1991 Defense Authorization Act.

ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE:  TACTICAL SURVEILLANCE SONOBUOY AND
RELATED SOFTWARE NEED TO BE TESTED TOGETHER

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-41
Pages:  13

Sonobuoys, which are dropped into the ocean from
antisubmarine aircraft, can pick up noises from enemy
submarines and transmit this information by radio to the
plane; this data can then be used to identify, locate, and
attack the submarines. GAO found that the Navy's revised
acquisition strategy adds risk to the Tactical Surveillance
Sonobuoy Program because the sonobuoys may need to be
modified if deficiencies are revealed during operational
testing in fiscal year 1993. Also, if the development of the
aircraft software is further delayed, the Navy will be
unable to use the sonobuoys for some time after they are
delivered. Finally, the revised strategy contradicts Navy
guidance, which generally requires operational test and
evaluation of an entire system before production is
authorized. The Tactical Surveillance Sonobuoy Program is
not an exception to this rule. Consequently, GAO recommends
that the Navy not authorize further production of the
sonobuoy until testing proves that it will work when it is
integrated with the new aircraft software.

OVER-THE-HORIZON RADAR:  BETTER JUSTIFICATION NEEDED FOR DOD
SYSTEMS' EXPANSION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-61
Pages:  25

The Air Force's Over-the-Horizon Backscatter radar, which
can detect and track bomber-size aircraft, was originally
developed to provide the North American Aerospace Defense
Command's continental air defenses with early warnings of an
attack. The Navy's Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar was
designed to provide air surveillance and warnings of bomber
attacks on Navy battle groups and other U.S. and allied
tactical forces.  This report (1) examines DOD's plans to
use the Air Force radar for counterdrug purposes and (2)
provides information on the cost, design, acquisition and
deployment, missions, and inoperability of both the Air
Force and Navy radar programs.  GAO concludes that DOD needs
to clarify the primary purposes of the central radar system.
If the main purpose is for air defense, rather than the
counterdrug mission, future budget requests should be
justified on that basis, describing what threat the system
is expected to detect. Before providing funds for any
additional Over-the-Horizon Backscatter radar sectors,
Congress may wish to have in hand satisfactory operational
test results on the east coast radar system.

NAVY BUDGET:  POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT
BUDGET

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-65
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed the Navy's aircraft procurement budget request
for fiscal year 1991 and appropriations for the preceding
two years to identify potential budget reductions and
rescissions, including amounts that are not being used for
the purposes appropriated. GAO identified $972.1 million in
potential reductions and rescissions for congressional
consideration. If the proposed procurement of certain
aircraft is reduced or deferred, $658.8 million would be
available from the fiscal year 1991 budget request. An
additional $313.3 million in fiscal years 1989 and 1990
appropriated funds could be rescinded since they are not
being used for the original purposes identified in the
budget requests.

This briefing report looks at the Navy's justification for
its fiscal year 1991 Weapons Procurement budget request and
prior year appropriations. GAO found potential reduction in
the following six weapon and ordnance systems  Trident II
(D-5) missile, Tomahawk cruise missile, High Speed Anti-
Radiation Missile (HARM), MK-48 advanced capability torpedo,
MK-50 advanced lightweight torpedo, and 16-inch gun
ammunition. Although no reductions are involved, GAO also
reviewed the following five weapon systems to report on
timely programmatic issues  Phoenix missile, Standard
Missile, Rolling Airframe Missile, Penguin missile, and
Vertical Launched Antisubmarine rocket.  GAO also identified
prior year funds that were no longer needed for purposes
specified in the selected weapon system procurement
programs.

NAVY BUDGET:  STATUS OF FLYING HOUR AND STEAMING DAY
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-62
Pages:  5

In 1988 Congress asked that the Navy provide budget
justifications for its aircraft flying hour and ship
steaming day programs. These justifications were to include
measurable mission-related goals and the resources need to
meet them, a method for measuring the degree to which the
goals have been met, and an explanation of any differences
between the goals and the actual results. GAO found that the
Navy added three performance indicators in its fiscal year
1990 steaming day budget justifications. The Navy has not
yet developed performance indicators for its flying hour
budget justifications but expects that indicators will be
incorporated into the fiscal year 1992 budget
justifications.  In addition, the Navy has made an effort to
quantify the relationship of flying hours and steaming days
to proficiency and mission readiness. However, because
factors other than the number and frequency of flying hours
and steaming days--such as personnel, equipment, materiel,
and maintenance--affect proficiency and mission readiness,
quantifying the relationship between budget requests and
accomplishment of program goals is difficult. The increased
operational requirements of Operation Desert Shield will
further complicate the process. Thus, the Navy cannot relate
actual versus planned program performance in terms of
program expenditures.

DEFENSE INVENTORY:  DOD'S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-87FS
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed DOD'S Humanitarian Assistance Program and its
effect on the utilization and donation programs run by the
General Services Administration. Under the Humanitarian
Assistance Program, DOD can make available for humanitarian
relief any nonlethal excess supplies in its system. In the
mid 1980s, the program was used to donate excess property to
help refugee and resistance groups in Afghanistan and to fly
wounded Afghans to the United States and Europe for medical
treatment. Since then, DOD has transferred excess property
to an increasing number of other countries.  This fact sheet
provides information on (1) the quantity and category of
excess material and equipment donated through the program on
an annual basis; (2) the value of these items, based on the
acquisition cost or other valuation; (3) a list of countries
and organizations within those countries that have received
excess property; (4) the annual costs for transporting
excess property; and (5) an assessment of how well excess
property has been used.

ENLISTED FORCE MANAGEMENT:  PAST PRACTICES AND FUTURE
CHALLENGES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-48
Pages:  61

Direct costs for enlisted personnel, who comprise over 85
percent of the total U.S. active-duty military force,
account for one-sixth of the annual defense budget. The high
cost of maintaining a balanced and ready enlisted force
underscores the need for efficient and effective management
of these resources, particularly as the services move toward
smaller forces. This report examines how the services (1)
manage the size and composition of their enlisted forces,
(2) are planning for enlisted force reductions, and (3)
comply with DOD requirements for enlisted force management.
Because the Navy and the Marine Corps do not keep records on
key enlisted force management data submitted to DOD, GAO
only reviewed the Air Force and the Army.

BATTLESHIPS:  ISSUES ARISING FROM THE EXPLOSION ABOARD THE
U.S.S. IOWA

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-4
Pages:  64

In the April 1989 explosion aboard the U.S.S. Iowa, 47
sailors died when bags of gun powder ignited in one of the
battleship's gun turrets. GAO asked the Department of
Energy's Sandia National Laboratories to review the Navy's
technical analysis of the incident; the Navy had concluded
that the explosion was caused by a deliberate act and not by
a defect in the gun or propellent.  While Sandia could
neither confirm nor deny the Navy's conclusion, it did
identify a plausible alternative explanation--that due to
its impact sensitivity, the gun powder could have exploded
as it was being rammed against the base of a shell. As a
result of Sandia's findings, the Navy halted all firings of
the 16-inch guns. With Sandia's help, it is doing more
testing. On the basis of that testing, and because of the
battleships' role in Operation Desert Shield, the Navy has
lifted the firing suspension for the U.S.S. Missouri and the
U.S.S. Wisconsin.  GAO found no evidence of any systemic
safety or serviceability problems aboard the battleships.
GAO did discover problems with the adequacy of supervisory
personnel levels, including the personnel for operating the
turrets, and with training for 16-inch gun operations.   GAO
recommends that, unless current Middle East operations
convincingly demonstrate the utility of the battleships to
support an amphibious assault, the Navy decommission the
Missouri and the Wisconsin.

DEFENSE PROCUREMENT:  NOT PROVIDING TECHNICAL DATA MAY LIMIT
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY COMPETITION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-53
Pages:  9

Full and open competition involves allowing all sources
capable of meeting the government's needs to compete. Of the
1,047 contracts valued at over $25,000 awarded by the
Defense General Supply Center in Richmond, Virginia, during
the third quarter of fiscal year 1988, less than two percent
were classified as based on other than full and open
competition; the rest were considered fully competitive.
However, GAO found that almost half of these contracts were
actually based on solicitations giving only part numbers as
item descriptions. In general, GAO believes that these
purchase descriptions were inconsistent with full and open
competition. Although the Defense Logistics Agency has
recently stopped classifying and processing solicitations as
fully competitive on the basis of part numbers, other
problems remain that may be causing opportunities for
competition to be missed. This report discusses actions
needed to ensure that Defense Logistics Agency supply
centers award future contracts on the basis of full and open
competition.

COST AND FINANCING OF OPERATION DESERT SHIELD

Order No.:  GAO/T-NSIAD-91-3
Pages:  15

The Comptroller General testified that the total U.S. cost
of Operation Desert Shield could exceed $130 billion in
fiscal year 1991. This estimate consists of three components
the baseline cost of the U.S. forces committed to Desert
Shield ($100 billion); the incremental cost of mounting the
operation, including troop deployment, calling up the
reserves, and providing required additional support for the
forces ($30 billion); and related costs like debt
forgiveness for Egypt and humanitarian assistance ($7
billion). The first component involves funds that would be
spent whether the troops were in the Middle East or
elsewhere.  To date, 35 countries have furnished troops and
equipment.  Yet contributions to defray U.S. expenses are
small relative to the total U.S. cost of the operation; DOD
has reported receipt of cash contributions of about $4.3
billion and in-kind contributions of about $379 million. As
a result of Operation Desert Shield, DOD is obligating its
fiscal year 1991 appropriations at a rapid pace and will
exhaust some of these funds by spring. A supplemental
appropriation to cover the costs of Operation Desert Shield
seems inevitable, the Comptroller General testified. Because
of many uncertainties in the cost estimates, however, GAO
believes that it would be inappropriate to provide a lump
sum supplemental now. Instead, Congress should provide
periodic appropriations during the fiscal year, as actual
costs become clearer. Some of the uncertainties are (1) the
unknown value of offsets like assistance in kind, including
fuel and water; (2) inadequate DOD guidance on what
constitutes Desert Shield costs (an important factor in any
emergency appropriations under the Budget Enforcement Act);
and (3) other factors like a decision to implement a
rotation policy.

RANGELAND MANAGEMENT:  BLM EFFORTS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED
LIVESTOCK GRAZING NEED STRENGTHENING

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-17
Pages:  16

Unauthorized livestock grazing on public rangelands--known
as grazing trespass--can take several forms, including
grazing more livestock than allowed by permit, grazing in
areas that are closed to livestock, or grazing during
unauthorized times of the year. An effective trespass
program must reasonably ensure that offenders, especially
willful ones, (1) will be detected and (2) when detected,
will be assessed a penalty that will not only penalize them
but serve as a deterrent to others. However, GAO found that
the Bureau of Land Management's trespass enforcement efforts
do not meet either of these requirements. Because many
grazing areas are inspected infrequently or not at all,
offenders are unlikely to be detected. Even when offenders
are detected, BLM often exacts no penalties and--for the
more serious violations--seldom assesses the minimum
penalties its own regulations require. BLM staff attribute
the shortfalls in trespass detection and deterrence
primarily to insufficient staff levels. While more staff
would undoubtedly improve performance, GAO believes that
more effective and aggressive detection and deterrence are
possible with existing staffing levels.

OREGON DUNES RECREATION AREA:  PATENTING OF MINING CLAIMS
COMPLIES WITH LAW

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-8
Pages:  39

Under the Mining Law of 1872, U.S. citizens and businesses
are allowed to locate mining claims on most federal lands
and then to obtain full title to them. In 1959 mining claims
were filed for silica sand along the Oregon coast--a site
which in 1972 became the Oregon National Dunes Recreation
Area. In October 1989, at the request of the claim holder,
the federal government transferred title through the patent
process to 780 acres of mining claims in this scenic area.
GAO found that the federal government acted properly when it
concluded that the claims contained an uncommon variety of
sand and, therefore, the claims were subject to the patent
provision of the Mining Law of 1872. In addition, the claim
holder and the federal government complied with the legal
and administrative requirements for patenting. GAO notes,
however, that this situation does raise questions about the
consistency of the mining law's patent provision with more
recent national natural resource policies that call for the
federal government to maintain ownership of federal lands
and to obtain fair market value for public resources.

PARKS AND RECREATION:  RESOURCE LIMITATIONS AFFECT CONDITION
OF FOREST SERVICE RECREATION SITES

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-48
Pages:  64

The Forest Service runs the largest inventory of outdoor
recreation sites in the country.  About 13,000 of these
sites are developed, featuring campgrounds, picnic areas,
and boating and interpretive sites.  GAO estimates that the
Forest Service had a $449 million backlog of unmet
maintenance and reconstruction needs at these sites, more
than double the amount the agency reported in 1986. GAO
developed its own estimate of the backlog because the Forest
Service lacks a reliable system for monitoring or reporting
on the nationwide condition and maintenance needs of its
developed recreation sites. Forest Service officials
attributed the backlog to a lack of personnel and funds. GAO
found that little of the agency's overall recreation budget
is devoted to making the needed repair, and factors like
aging facilities and increased usage are compounding the
problem. GAO is concerned that deferred maintenance could
ultimately result in the loss of many sites. Resource
limitations were only one of several factors affecting
changes in the size and type and to a lesser extent the
number and length of season of developed recreation sites.
However, resource limitations have reduced and eliminated
services like garbage collection and site cleaning. The
Forest Service is now relying on volunteer and a
public/private cost-share program to help compensate for
limited resources. GAO believes that this strategy--while
helpful--faces constraints that will limit its effectiveness
in reducing the backlog.

REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT:  FEDERAL SUPPORT TO THE STATES HAS
DECLINED

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-51
Pages:  40

The Refugee Act of 1980 authorized federal assistance to
resettle refugees in the United States on a uniform basis,
regardless of their country of origin. Upwards of 900,000
refugees have entered this country over the past decade.
Although funds have been appropriated since the expiration
of the act in 1988, the amounts involved have declined,
shifting refugee resettlement costs to state and local
governments. As a result of this and diminished funds to
states for job training and other services, Department of
Health and Human Services assistance per refugee fell 48
percent in 1989 constant dollars--from $6,921 to $3,600.
This report provides (1) estimates of the costs transferred
from the federal government to states as a result of recent
cuts in federal refugee assistance, (2) information from and
views of public and private sector officials on whether
recent reductions have resulted in service cutbacks to
refugees, and (3) data on changes in the percentage of
refugees receiving cash assistance and changes in other
indicators of refugee self-sufficiency.

LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE:  STATES CUSHIONED FUNDING
CUTS BUT ALSO SCALED BACK PROGRAM BENEFITS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-13
Pages:  52

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides
eligible households with assistance for home energy costs.
Assistance is available to (1) help families with cooling
costs, (2) prevent energy cutoffs in crisis situations, and
(3) help families make their homes more energy efficient.
GAO found that between fiscal years 1986 and 1989, the
states--while offsetting about one-fourth of the cuts in
federal funding for the program, mainly with oil overcharge
funds resulting from legal settlements with major oil
producers--scaled back energy assistance benefits In
addition, most states served fewer households, although 43
percent attributed the decrease to factors other than
federal funding cuts, such as improved economic conditions
that reduced the need for assistance. States generally
complied with key program requirements by assuring the
Department of Health and Human Services that they were (1)
doing outreach activities, especially for the elderly and
handicapped, and (2) targeting benefits to households most
in need. Also, the four states GAO visited had incorporated
fiscal controls to prevent erroneous payments. GAO found
that in nearly all states, other government and private
sector programs provide home energy assistance to low-income
households In fiscal year 1989, this assistance amounted to
about $200 million.

TAX ADMINISTRATION:  EFFECTIVENESS OF IRS' RETURN PREPARER
PENALTY PROGRAM IS QUESTIONABLE

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-12
Pages:  73

Almost half the individual income tax returns filed in 1989
were done by paid return preparers. The Internal Revenue
Service has had problems with what it characterizes as
incompetent and unscrupulous tax return preparers who
understate their clients' tax liabilities. GAO found that
IRS needs to better ensure that preparers engaged in
negligent or abusive tax practices are penalized. Although
IRS generally assesses the right penalty once it decides to
penalize a preparer, penalty cases are often not opened when
potential preparer misconduct was evident on returns with at
least $5,000 in taxes owed. This limits IRS' ability to
penalize preparers who are guilty of misconduct and may
weaken the agency's ability to deter preparer misconduct for
the large number of returns not reviewed in IRS' examination
program. IRS examiners and their supervisors said that they
were reluctant to pursue the penalties because of the low
dollar amounts involved.  Even though preparer penalties may
not yield significant revenues, GAO believes that their
potential long-term effect in encouraging voluntary
compliance by preparers and their clients should also be
considered. GAO also found that IRS district offices
sometimes assess different penalties and penalty amounts for
similar misconduct. IRS referral of taxpayer preparers for
disciplinary action can provide further incentives for
compliance. However, the effectiveness of this process is
limited because referrals are often not made when required.

INTERNATIONAL AVIATION:  IMPLICATIONS OF RATIFYING MONTREAL

disasters. Overall, GAO concludes that American victims of
international aviation accidents and their families would be
better compensated under Protocol No. 3 than under existing
internal agreements. Claimants would no longer have to prove
that the airline was at fault before they received
compensation, and incentives would be provided for airlines
to settle claims quickly. Claimants' costs would be reduced
because in many cases a trial would be avoided. In addition,
the Protocol would raise the airlines' liability limit,
provide funds for additional compensation of victims, and
decrease the proportion of the damage awards that go to
paying claimants' legal costs. The Protocol and the plan
would also increase the likelihood that Americans' lawsuits
would be tried in U.S. courts if compensation offers are
unsatisfactory, resulting in U.S. standards of compensation
being used in determining damage awards. Finally, GAO
concludes that Protocol No. 3 is unlikely to harm airline
safety.  Adverse economic impacts due to aviation accidents
and government safety regulations--not fear of litigation--
are the primary incentives for airlines to operate safely.

TRUCK SAFETY:  IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN FHWA'S MOTOR CARRIER
SAFETY PROGRAM

Order No:  GAO/RCED-91-30
Pages:  28

To promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles,
the Federal Highway Administration is required to develop a
way to ensure the safety fitness of owners and operators. In
October 1986, FHWA began a safety review program to educate
motor carriers--persons or companies that transport goods or
passengers as a business--about federal safety regulations
and to rate the safety management controls that carriers
have in place to comply with these regulations. GAO found
that FHWA had rated about 40 percent of the interstate motor
carriers in business as of May 1990. While the agency has
accomplished a great deal, about 129,000 carriers still need
to be rated before FHWA'S established deadline of September
30, 1992. GAO believes that FHWA is unlikely to meet this
deadline because (1) the universe of carriers is constantly
changing (due to the entry of new carriers and carriers that
merge and go out of business) and (2) FHWA has assigned a
limited number of safety investigators to this task.
Although 70 percent of the motor carriers assessed under the
safety review program received a less than satisfactory
rating, FHWA has not adequately implemented its two follow-
up procedures for ensuring that carriers correct
deficiencies in safety management controls--certification
letters from carriers and compliance reviews. Until FHWA
knows whether carriers have improved their controls, it
cannot be sure that its safety review program is promoting
the safe operation of commercial vehicles.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL:  EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE OCEANIC SYSTEM
DELAYED

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-2
Pages:  13

Air traffic control services in non-radar oceanic areas
remain essentially unchanged from the 1950s, with oceanic
air traffic controllers still manually updating flight
progress on the basis of periodic radio reports received
from pilots. This labor-intensive and time-consuming process
results in large separation distances between aircraft, long
flights, and lost opportunities for fuel savings. While FAA
has started to provide oceanic controllers with automation
support, the agency's primary modernization effort--the
Oceanic Display and Planning System, still not fully
operational, is over three years behind schedule, and is now
more than three times the original contract cost. FAA'S
long-term strategy is to use satellites to provide accurate,
near real-time control information on oceanic flights;
however, because this strategy now relies on the successful
deployment of the Oceanic Display and Planning System, the
outcome of this approach is unknown.
