<h2>Endometriosis 2000 Meeting Focuses On Research Agenda</h2>

A meeting to explore the causes and treatments of endometriosis
was held on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda
recently.
<P>
Titled &quot;<font size="+1">Endometriosis 2000</font>,&quot; the meeting was cosponsored
by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD), NlH's Office of Research on Women's Health, the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the National Institute
on Aging, in cooperation with the Endometriosis Association.
<P>
Endometriosis results when tissue resembling the endometrium--the
lining of the uterus--begins growing on the outside of the uterus
and perhaps in other parts of the abdominal cavity.
<P>
The disorder affects as many as 10 percent of women of reproductive
age, with 30 to 40 percent of the women diagnosed with endometriosis
experiencing notable pain. In addition, a diagnosis of endometriosis
has been found to be a significant factor in female infertility.
<P>
In his opening talk, NICHD Director Duane Alexander, MD, set the
tone for the meeting, describing endometriosis as mystifying,
both in its causes and treatments.
<P>
&quot;Although it is generally agreed to be a common disorder,
we really have no good data on its impact as a public health problem,&quot;
Dr. Alexander said. &quot;We don't even have good information
on its prevalence, in part because it is often misdiagnosed or
under diagnosed, and because it varies widely according to the
population that's under study.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Alexander noted that although treatments for endometriosis
have existed for many years, they often have not been based on
rigorous scientific testing.
<P>
He added, however, that basic science efforts by the NICHD and
NlH's Office of Research on Women's Health have begun laying the
groundwork for rigorous study of the disease.
<P>
The Director of the Office of Research on Women's Health, Vivian
Pinn, MD, explained that endometriosis has been a priority with
that office since its research agenda was devised in 1991. She
added that endometriosis is one of the two leading indicators
for hysterectomy for women under age 54 and is the most frequently
diagnosed uterine dysfunction in women.
<P>
&quot;We need more knowledge about the origins of endometriosis
and the development of more effective, non-surgical interventions,&quot;
Dr. Pinn said.
<P>
Dr. Pinn noted that the bulk of that Office's original funding
was earmarked for collaborative efforts with NICHD for research
on endometriosis and another uterine condition, leiomyoma.
<P>
&quot;I can assure you that endometriosis has been, and will continue
to be, among our highest priorities for research, until we have
some of the answers which are now being sought,&quot; she said.
<P>
Mary Lou Ballweg, the President and Executive Director of the
<a href="endoassn.html">Endometriosis Association</a>, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, described
the disease from the patient's perspective.
<P>
&quot;If endometriosis is baffling to the doctors who treat it
and the researchers who study it, imagine what it must be like
to have it,&quot; she said.
<P>
Ms. Ballweg noted that endometriosis is often diagnosed long after
the first time its symptoms appear. She cited three studies which
found that although endometriosis may first appear in the teen
years, it may not be diagnosed until 10 or 15 years later. She
speculated that this delay in diagnosis might result in some women
having hysterectomies when they might otherwise have avoided them.
<P>
Because research has provided few insights, the myth persists
that endometriosis is a disease of over educated career women
who have postponed childbearing.
<P>
&quot;In short, endometriosis can be, from the patient's point
of view, a nightmare of misinformation, myths, taboos, delayed
diagnoses, and problematic, hit-and-miss treatments overlaid on
a painful, chronic, stubborn disease,&quot; she said.
<P>
Brenda Eskenazi, an epidemiologist at the University of California
in Berkeley, explained why endometriosis has been so difficult
to study.
<P>
First, she said, the disease is difficult to classify, because
it takes a number of forms, from tiny reddish growths to large
brown lesions. Some women experience significant pain, while others
may not even realize they have the disease.
<P>
Furthermore, the actual number of people who have endometriosis
is also difficult to determine. Severe cases of the disease, she
said, would probably be seen by physicians. But endometriosis
cases involving few or no symptoms may never receive medical attention.
<P>
One of the most common methods for studying risks for the disease
is the case control study. In this method, women who are diagnosed
with the disease, the <I>cases, </I>are compared <I>to controls,
</I>women with similar characteristics who do not have the disease.
<P>
The major problem with this method, Dr. Eskenazi said, becomes
apparent when researchers question the women about factors that
may have influenced the development of their endometriosis. To
illustrate her point, she gave a hypothetical example involving
exercise. When questioned about whether they exercise or not,
the control group might say that they always exercise, whereas
the case group might say they never do. What the questioning may
fail to reveal, however, is that the case group did exercise,
but gave up the practice when their symptoms began.
<P>
To accurately gauge the extent of endometriosis in the population
as a whole, Dr. Eskenazi said that scientists need some way to
screen large numbers of women for the disease. But the only definitive
way to diagnose endometriosis is through laparoscopy.
<P>
Performing this procedure on a large number of women to learn
if a few of them have undetected endometriosis would be inexcusable,
Dr. Eskenazi explained, as medical ethics forbids subjecting otherwise
healthy people to the risks of surgery when there is no medical
need for it.
<P>
She added that mass screening for endometriosis will only be possible
with the discovery of some sort of biochemical marker--perhaps
a chemical found exclusively in blood samples of women who have
endometriosis.
<P>
In a later presentation, NICHD grantee Kathy Sharpe-Timms, PhD.,
HCLD, briefly discussed the possibility of devising such a test.
Sharpe-Timms, a researcher at the University of Missouri in Columbia,
noted that because endometriosis seems to vary so greatly, any
blood test for the condition would probably seek to detect a large
number of chemical compounds, not just one.
<P>
Overall, she said, studies on the biochemistry of endometriosis
have been inconclusive. She listed a variety of substances produced
by endometriosis lesions, but added that it is unknown whether
these compounds produce the disease or are merely results of it.
<P>
In particular, she said, biochemical studies have made it clear
that one type of endometrial growth, petechiae, needs closer attention
than it has received. These small, reddish growths are typically
overlooked by physicians. However, petechiae produce greater amounts
of chemicals known as prostaglandins than other types of endometrial
growths.
<P>
&quot;I caution you, please don't ignore this particular implant
when you're looking at patients,&quot; she told the largely physician
audience attending the meeting.
<P>
NICHD grantee Bruce Lessey, PhD, MD, reported that a protein his
group is investigating may play a key role in explaining why certain
patients with minimal endometriosis fail to get pregnant. Dr.
Lessey is a researcher at the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill.
<P>
The protein, called the Beta-3 subunit of the vitronectin receptor--Beta-3,
for short-appears on the lining of the uterus on the 19th or 20th
day of the menstrual cycle. A group of endometriosis patients
Dr. Lessey and his coworkers studied lacked appropriate expression
of Beta-3 during the receptive time of their monthly cycles. From
animal studies, it appears that Beta-3 is important for allowing
the embryo to implant on the wall of the uterus.
<P>
The researchers observed these women for four years. Few of those
who did not receive any treatment for their endometriosis have
become pregnant. Otherso were treated for a time with the drug
Lupron which interferes with the production of estrogen. Most
of the women became pregnant shortly after ending their course
of therapy with the drug.
<P>
NICHD grantee James H. Liu, MD, a researcher at the University
of Cincinnati College of Medicine, reviewed current treatments
for endometriosis. He said that recently diagnosed patients have
three options: no therapy, surgical therapy, and drug therapy.
<P>
Dr. Liu warned against treating women who have evidence of endometriosis
but do not have symptoms.
<P>
&quot;Do not treat asymptomatic patients,&quot; he advised the
conference participants. &quot;If you treat, you may generate
symptoms within one month of treatment.&quot;
<P>
Surgery is an option for severe cases. For some patients who experience
extreme pain and are not concerned with fertility, removal of
the ovaries and uterus may be the best option. In other cases,
laparoscopy accompanied by laser surgery to selectively remove
endometrial growths may be advisable. Dr. Liu cautioned, however,
that endometrial growths removed surgically may later return,
requiring additional treatment.
<P>
Physicians may also offer their patients the choice of a variety
of hormonal treatments designed to temporarily stop the ovaries
from functioning. Again, however, once therapy stops, symptoms
may return.
<P>
At times, patients may be given hormonal therapy before surgery,
to decrease the size of their endometrial growths. Dr. Liu warned
that this approach may backfire, however, as the therapy may shrink
a growth so much that the surgeon may miss it. After therapy,
the growth may reappear and symptoms may resume.
<P>
The most widespread hormonal treatment is with oral contraceptives,
which combine estrogen and progestin. Side effects of this treatment
are weight gain, water retention, nausea, vaginal bleeding, and
a slightly increased risk of stroke.
<P>
Progestins alone may also relieve the symptoms of endometriosis.
These may be given orally, or injected in a slow-release form
which gradually releases small amounts of the hormone. Injections
of Depo Provera generally last 1 to 3 months. Among the side effects
of this therapy are weight gain, vaginal dryness, water retention,
and mood changes.
<P>
Another hormonal therapy is treatment with Danazol, a testosterone-like
compound. Dr. Liu noted that the side effects of this treatment
are highly undesirable. These are weight gain, reduction in breast
size, oily skin, acne, increase in facial hair, and muscle cramps.
Moreover, women who take Danazol for more than six months may
experience a permanent deepening of the voice.
<P>
The remaining therapy is treatment with one of a variety of GnRH
analogs, compounds that halt estrogen release by preventing release
of Gonadotropin releasing hormone, the master hormone which ultimately
signals estrogen production. The scientific c evidence suggests
the GnRH analogs are more effective at relieving the pain of endometriosis
than are any of the other hormonal therapies.
<P>
However, as estrogen production ceases with GnRH analogs, such
menopausal symptoms as vaginal dryness, hot flushes, mood changes,
and decrease in sex drive may result. Because the therapy interferes
with calcium absorption, it must be halted after six months, or
irreparable bone loss will result.
<P>
Dr. Liu said that several clinical trials were under way to extend
the therapy by preventing or slowing the bone loss. One strategy
is to give study volunteers very small doses of estrogen and progestin
in addition to GnRH analogs. Other researchers are reducing the
dose of GnRH analog so that only a slight amount of estrogen is
released.
<P>
A final discussion at the conference involved a summary of future
research needs. A consensus emerged that the current classification
system for grading endometriotic lesions was less than satisfactory
and required rigorous redefinition. This was deemed essential
to establishing clear baselines for pathophysiology studies of
endometriosis morbidities.
