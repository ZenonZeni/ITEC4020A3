<h2>Free press poorly understood in Ethiopia, CPJ mission finds</h2><p>

By Jeanne Sahadi<br>
<P>

In the last five years, Ethiopia has undergone a political revolution--ending 17 years of Communist dictatorship and holding democratic elections for the first time in the country&#146;s history.<P>

These changes held great promise for the press, as evidenced by the explosion into existence of independent media in 1992, as well as the passage of a press law and a first-ever democratic constitution that guarantee the rights to free speech and free press.<P>

Yet, for three years running, Ethiopia has imprisoned more journalists than any other country in Africa--31 were jailed at the beginning of 1996. Many are detained in retaliation for their reporting and held for weeks or months without charge, only to be released on bails set so high that a journalist&#146;s newspaper or friends and family have to go into debt to pay the bond. <P>

To investigate the situation further and to help free those who have been imprisoned for their reporting,  CPJ Africa Program Coordinator Kakuna Kerina and CPJ board member Josh Friedman of <CITE>Newsday</CITE>&nbsp;went to Ethiopia at the end of May. They met with the country&#146;s prime minister, justice minister, and speaker of parliament, as well as with journalists in all sectors of the media, representatives of local nongovernmental organizations, and members of the international diplomatic community.<P>

Friedman and Kerina found that in addition to being targeted by the government for critical reporting,  Ethiopian journalists are at risk of detention because of the police force&#146;s profound lack of understanding of journalists&#146; rights and the role of a free press. "The police force is in its infancy. Many were soldiers who protected the government, not the people," said Justice Minister Mahteme Solomon in a meeting with the CPJ team. <P>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="lullit.jpeg">In November 1995, for instance, Lullit G. Michael, the editor of the independent newspaper <CITE>The Monitor</CITE>&nbsp;, was arrested in connection with an article she reprinted from the state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). The article reported on an assassination attempt on former Ethiopian dictator Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam. Michael said she had to explain to the police who arrested her that ENA was a government news service. When she appeared in court, the judge refused to hear her comments, stated that he had not read the article in question, and remanded her to custody, where she remained without charge for nine days. She was released on a 10,000 birr bond (US$1,600), but not before the court ordered <CITE>The Monitor</CITE> to suspend publication for three weeks. Michael&#146;s case remains open.<P>

Following up on their meetings with Ethiopian officials, Kerina and Friedman sent a letter to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his cabinet ministers, calling again for the immediate and unconditional release of all journalists imprisoned for exercising their legal rights. At this writing, a total of 10 remain behind bars. <P>

In September, CPJ will publish its report on the mission that will provide analysis and documentation of the problems facing Ethiopian journalists. The report will also put forth recommendations to the Ethiopian and U.S. governments to improve the situation. Among them, CPJ recommends that the Meles government:<P>
<!-- List Tag --><UL>
<LI>Eliminate all laws criminalizing slander against public officials;<P>
<LI>Grant the private press equal and unrestricted access to government press conferences; and<P>
<LI>Train police, judicial and government officials on the rights of journalists, the role of the press in a democratic society, and general human rights issues. <P>
</UL>
