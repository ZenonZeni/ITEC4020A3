<HR>Both HRVs can work in either panchromatic or multispectral imaging modes,
singly or together. <BR>
The panchromatic mode uses a single spectral band, 0.51&shyp;0.73 micron
(visible light without blue), to produce black and white images resolving
fine geographic detail. <BR>
<BR>
The multispectral mode uses three bands (green, 0.50&shyp;0.59 micron; red,
0.61&shyp;0.68 micron; and near infrared, 0.79 to 0.89 micron), each with
its own reflectance properties, to create coloured images. Numerous landscape
features can be interpreted from the composite images.<BR>
<BR>
Images are split at the telescope's focal plane. Part of the image is sent
to a line of 6000 photodetectors which emit electrical charges when struck
by light. These build the panchromatic image. Each detector corresponds
to 10 m pixels, giving images 60 km wide. Images are constructed line by
line as the satellite moves.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the image goes to a dichroic beam splitter. This glass device
directs each band to another detector strip. But these detectors receive
insufficient light to fire, so Charged Coupled Devices generate a signal
from two adjacent detectors, hence multispectral mode's 20 m colour resolution.
<BR>
SPOT encodes the images for transmission to Earth. The satellite may download
the image to a Direct Receiving Station in real time if within range, otherwise
the image is recorded and downloaded later. <BR>

SPOT can observe the same zone from different angles over a number of orbits.<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>Images of large areas may be built up over several passes.<BR>
<BR>
Captured images must be preprocessed: corrected for perspective and atmospheric
distortion. Images at various levels of preprocessing are available for
purchase. Higher levels provide precise geometric alignment with ground
checkpoints and existing maps, in addition to the corrections for viewing
angle, reflectance characteristics and detector sensitivity offered at lower
levels.<BR>
<BR>
SPOT''s sideways viewing allows capture of images of the same site taken
from different angles, using parallax to create stereopairs. These are used
for stereoplotting, topographic mapping, and automatic stereocorrelation,
from which Digital Elevation Models (3D computer landscape images) can be
derived.<BR>
<BR>
Processed images, typically 30&shyp;100 Mb, are available on CD ROM, magnetic
tape or printed form.<BR>
