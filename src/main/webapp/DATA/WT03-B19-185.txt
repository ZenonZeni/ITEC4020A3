<P>
The major energy services of electricity and gas are very
competitively priced. The reliable supply provides vital protection
to industries dependent on uninterrupted power.
<P>
Ongoing reforms of Victoria's energy supply industries are aimed
at
a continuous improvement in costs and the quality of service.

Warwick Bisley<br>
Managing Director<br>
Kemcor Australia<br>
<P>
Kemcor Australia was the first company in Victoria to be formally
recognised as having adequate internal procedures to obtain an
exemption from design approval processes for the storage and
handling of dangerous goods.
<P>
If companies in Victoria can show compliance and accountability
for
the storage and handling of dangerous goods, and demonstrate they
have established and can maintain effective safety management
systems, regulatory demands will be reduced to the minimum
necessary for ongoing compliance.
<P>
According to Mr Bisley, &quot;the benefits of this system to the
business
community are clear. Because we own the process, it is easier
for us
to implement it. The results speak for themselves&quot;.
<P>
Company commitment to safety systems of highest quality can
replace constant application for approvals.

KPMG Data 1995
<P>
<P>
<I>Definition</I>: Industrial users were asked to rank the reliability
and 
availability of supply in each of these cities in comparison to
Melbourne, on a response range between minus 3 and plus 3. A 
positive score indicates that the service in the city is considered
superior to Melbourne's and a negative score indicates that 
Melbourne's service is considered superior.
<P>
<hr><p>
<I><B>Melbourne's gas costs are substantially cheaper than most
cities, being 70% lower than Osaka, 83% lower than Singapore,
and 35% lower than Kuala Lumpur.</B></I>
