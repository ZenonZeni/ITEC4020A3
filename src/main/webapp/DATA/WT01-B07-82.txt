Abstract: The purpose of ventilation is to maintain and improve
air quality in a building by removing polluted air and supplying
fresh air. In principle, the required ventilation rates for desired
air quality can be calculated if the pollution loads, outdoor
air quality and requested indoor air quality are known. This method
is often referred to as an air quality method in ventilation design.
A European prestandard 'Ventilation for Buildings - Design Criteria
for the Indoor Environment' outlines such a method. The data for
the application of the standard is rapidly accumulating through
extensive measurements and is soon available for the general application
in ventilation design. Because the data are not yet completed
for practical use, additional prescriptive requirements and criteria
have to be used in the design of ventilation systems. These criteria
include such aspects as the selection of ventilation strategy,
ventilation rates, balancing of airflows, ventilation effectiveness,
local exhaust systems, cleaning of intake air, location of air
intakes, cleanliness of equipment, air recirculation, air tightness,
noise control and demand controlled ventilation. The reasoning
behind these requirements is presented and discussed in the paper.

Abstract: Why are we ventilating buildings and how much ventilation
is required? These are the fundamental questions that engineers,
architects and hygienists have tried to answer over the last two
hundred years. During this period, dramatic changes have been
seen in the philosophy behind ventilation. Ventilation standards
are at present being revised in different parts of the world.
Common trends in the revisions will be discussed and reviewed
in a historical perspective.

Abstract: The space between neighbouring two detached houses has
been often narrow in built up areas and becomes smaller in recent
suburban areas. It is sometimes too narrow to be used as a reasonable
space, which means that it is a dead space, and such a space is
called an inter-house gap in this paper. However, the authors
carried out a field survey to examine the thermal conditions and
air flow in an inter-house gap in summer to find that the micro
climate in the space was different from the thermal environment
in the surrounding space. The air temperature in the inter-house
gap is lower than that in the surrounding outdoor space in the
daytime, and the air flow in the space was controlled by the shaper
of the inter-house gap. These results indicate that it is possible
to use the inter-house gap as a thermal buffer zone between indoor
and outdoor space or a useful natural cooling resource in summer,
although it is not useful as an ordinary active space. Therefore,
if the neighbouring two houses are well designed to utilize the
characteristics of the thermal conditions in the inter-house gap,
it will contribute to the indoor thermal environment. The natural
ventilation is one of the most effective methods to introduce
the cool air in an inter-house gap into neighbouring indoor spaces,
since the air flow in an inter-house gap may be controlled by
the shaper of the inter-house gap to be useful for this device.
For this purpose, the characteristics of the air flow in an inter-house
gap, especially the wind pressure on the neighbouring walls, have
to be studied more deeply. A series of wind tunnel tests to examine
the characteristics of the wind pressure on the walls facing to
inter-house gaps are reported in this paper.

Abstract: A nationwide energy and indoor climate survey has been
carried out in Sweden (the ELIB study). The study indicates that
between 600,000 and 900,000 Swedes or about 10% of the population
are exposed to indoor climates that can affect their health and
well-being. Ventilation, in particular, is poor in Swedish dwellings.
Ventilation does not come up to the norms in four of five single-family
houses and in about half of the apartments in multi-family buildings.
Another finding is that residents in new, large multi-family buildings
and people suffering from allergies are most troubled by defects
in the indoor climate. By increasing the ventilation, the problems
of humid indoor air and high radon concentration would be reduced
considerably. The percentage of single-family houses with humidity
of indoor air exceeding 45% RH in the air would decreased from
19% to only 4%. The proportion of dwellings with radon concentrations
above the norms would be reduced considerably. The consequences
of ventilation on the dryness of indoor air in some buildings
must also be taken into account, however. An increase n ventilation
would lead to a substantial increase in the energy used. The ventilation
losses in the housing stock would increase by about 36% (from
about 22 TWh to about 30 TWh annually).

Abstract: The house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus)
is found in furnishings in most homes. Although only a fraction
of a millimetre in size, it has been identified as an important
risk to health because of the allergens both on its enticle and
in the faeces. When the allergen becomes airborne, it is a potent
provoker of asthma and almost certainly contributed to the 2000
asthma-related deaths which occur each year in the UK.The widespread
occurrence of D.pteronyssinus and its potential for causing serious
effects on health have prompted research to establish ways of
removing it from homes. In principle then, increased ventilation
should be capable of reducing indoor humidity and eliminating
dust mites. This raises the question of what humidity must be
achieved and whether, in practice, ventilation alone can maintain
the critical humidity. The critical humidity for dust mite survival
has been stated as 7g/kg absolute humidity, equivalent to about
40-45% RH (Korsgard 1982). The Danish results suggest that installing
whole-house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) will
not only cause a significant reduction in dust mite populations,
but bring about a clinically relevant reduction in asthma symptoms.
Full MVHR achieves a controlled air flow, ensuring a reliable
supply of outside air to all rooms and extraction from moisture-producing
rooms (kitchen and bathroom). It is claimed that the clinical
benefits are greater than those obtained with any prophylactic
drugs. Furthermore, it has been shown (using assumed rates of
moisture production indoors) that the critical humidity can be
achieved using MVHR for much of a typical winter over much of
the UK (McIntyre 1993). In the UK, the outdoor humidity exceeds
7g/kg for 5% of the winter (from December to March) but is generally
below 5g/kg during this period. Extracting moist air from the
house and replacing it by relatively dry air from outside could
therefore reduce humidity levels indoors to below those required
for HDM survival. In spite of the existing findings, there are
some doubts as to the likely impact of MVHR on mites in UK homes:
(a) the critical humidity of 7g/kg is achieved for a smaller proportion
of the year in the UK than in Denmark, (b) furnishings and cleaning
practices may differ between the two countries and (c) UK homes
are typically less tight than those built in Denmark, which will
render MVHR less effective. It is therefore important to replicate
the Danish work in the UK. To achieve an improvement in asthmatics'symptoms
it is necessary not only to reduce the number of dust mites but
also to remove the allergen already present in the home. The regular
use of a high efficiency vacuum cleaner designed to collect dust
without recirculating fine dust into the room air is thought to
be capable of reducing the allergens reservoir in soft furnishings.

Abstract: There are many reasons for promoting a thorough examination
of requirements for domestic aeration and ventilation systems:
There is an emerging awareness of the relationship between home
and health. Pollution levels inside the home, often higher than
those outside, can only be brought down to within acceptable limits
by using efficient specific ventilation systems. About one fifth
of French homes have no specific ventilation system. Insufficient
ventilation is one of the major errors committed when renovating
old buildings. Paradoxically enough, systematic installation of
airtight windows is rarely compensated by provision for a suitable
air circulation system. About 30% of renovated buildings suffer
from this serious defect. Many older ventilation systems are now
in urgent need of replacement or adaption. Wide-reaching public
information programmes on energy saving fail to mention the need
for aeration.

Abstract: An office building situated in downtown Zurich was investigated.
It contains 750 workstations on 5 floors, each separated into
3 large open space offices. Floors and walls were mainly covered
by carpets and smoking was generally allowed. The goal was to
study the effects of interventions on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)
and the Building Symptom Index (BSI). The building was investigated
right before, in August 1994, and one month after each change,
in November 1994 and February 1995. Key IAQ parameters were measured
(CO2, TVOC, VOC, oxidizable gases, formaldehyde, temperature and
humidity). A questionnaire was distributed to a large sample of
occupants to assess their judgment on air quality and building
related symptoms. Carpet cleaning lead to a higher air acceptability
and partly to a reduction of the BSI. A combination of carpet
cleaning and non-smoking had only small positive effects on BSI
and the air acceptability. The effects of reducing the mean temperature
had only insignificant positive effects on the judgments of occupants
and the reported symptoms. The measured physical and chemical
IAQ parameters did not show significant differences between the
investigated offices and the three periods. Conclusions: The use
of the questionnaire is an important additional tool to assess
indoor air conditions. Chemical and physical parameters alone
do not necessarily represent the perceived IAQ. Cleaning of carpeted
walls with a liquid extraction system, combined with a small reduction
of total carpet surface, has a positive effect on the perceived
air quality which could be explained by a reduction of surface
pollution emission. Additional non-measured factors seem to have
an important influence on the perceived IAQ and the building related
symptoms. Radiant temperature and illumination, in relation to
sun exposure, could be such factors.

Abstract: As part of a coordinated effort by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate radon reduction
schools technology, indoor air quality measurements were conducted
in 12 school buildings across the U.S. to establish a database
of specific contaminant levels. A subset of this data consisted
of particle measurements reflecting real-time particle counts
in conjunction with time weighted average gravimetric PM-10 data.
Elevated levels of gravimetric indoor PM-10 concentrations were
measured in the schools. These levels may be attributed to various
factors including low ventilation rates, high occupant density,
classroom activity and entrainment of particles released from
carpeted floors. A relation between the particle counts and PM-10
measurements is presented in this paper from the measurements
taken in the non-smoking school environments. The relation does
provide an initial tool to approximate PM-10 concentrations as
a function of particle count data. While premature, at present,
it does hold promise as more paired counts and PM-10 measurements
are added from other schools throughout the U.S.

Abstract: Human exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
is a function of two factors: (i) ETS generated in the indoor
environment, and (ii) ETS removed from indoor air by ventilation
and air filtration processes. One principal aspect of both is
size distribution of the particulate phase of tobacco smoke. The
aim of the research presented here was to investigate size characteristics
of ETS in several residential and public places and the effect
ventilation had on time change of the characteristics. An important
conclusion from this research is that natural ventilation which
is the most common type of ventilation in sub tropical climates,
is often not sufficient for reducing human exposure to ETS. In
some residential houses, ETS concentration was still high three
hours after generation and the mean particle size remained unchanged
for most of the measurement period. A broad, well defined ETS
peak with concentration in the peak up to 5 x 10 to the power
of 4 particles cm-3 is often observed in club air during events
when large numbers of smokers are present, regardless of the efforts
to improve air quality by natural ventilation.

Abstract: There is a growing awareness among the health and safety
authorities, building and environmental regulatory bodies, building
owners and more importantly the building users of the importance
of preventing or at least reducing the risk of environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS) in public buildings. This awareness coincides with
the studies around the world on whether the levels of carcinogens
in the diluted sidestream smoke of tobacco products are sufficient
to cause cancer. It has been reported that passive smoking increases
the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers, and that it may also be
connected to heart disease. This risk was reported to be in the
range of 10 to 30%. In addition, ETS has irritant effects such
as eye irritation, headaches, throat and nasal symptoms, and can
aggravate asthma. It can obscure vision and creates an unpleasant
odour. The UK government's code of practice on smoking in public
places promotes the use of separate rooms for smokers, with non
smoking being the norm in most places. In some establishments,
however, it is impractical to supply totally separate rooms for
smokers and non-smokers and the space may be divided into smoking
and non-smoking areas with limited physical partitioning. This
allows ETS to migrate from the smoking areas to the non-smoking
areas, and the extent to which this takes place depends upon the
ventilation and partitioning strategy. Guidance needs to be provided
for such cases on how best to ventilate the spaces and what effect
partial partitioning will have. In this paper a comparative assessment
of alternative ventilation strategies and space partitioning for
minimising migration of tobacco smoke in to public building enclosures
is reported. The study is based on computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) modelling and uses an airborne contaminant as the 'marker'
for ETS migration.

Abstract: Following considerable lobbying by anti-smoking campaigners
in the UK, environmental health officers employed by the local
councils have agreed to test pubs which have been reported as
'too smoky'. Whereas a customer may enter a smoky atmosphere and
then decide to walk away from it, this option is not available
to staff. Of more significance therefore, and to employers as
well as to the individuals is the potential effect of passive
smoking on the staff who work in public houses. Legislation in
the UK (Health and Safety Executive, 1974) places a duty of care
on employers to provide and maintain a safe working environment
for employees without risks to health. Previous work by the authors
(Currie and Capper, 1994) involved the assessment of public houses
in the north of England and southern Scotland with the aim of
identifying potential problems and considering improvements that
could be made to accommodate best environmental practice. Environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) surrogates were measured, together with carbon
dioxide (CO2) as a general air quality indicator. The air quality
assessments in each establishment identified potential problems
in respect of the traditional design approach to ventilated spaces.
Recent studies have tended to concentrate on the subjective assessment
of environmental health issues and there is therefore a need for
more objective assessment methods. A computerised fluid dynamics
(CFD) model ARIA has been used to model airflows with the aim
of identifying inefficiencies in existing ventilation systems,
for example air distribution 'dead-spots'.

Abstract: In the last ten years an increased attention has been
devoted to the indoor air quality for different reasons: 1) it
has been emphasised that many domestic components (that is building
materials, furniture, fuel for heating and cooking, etc.) can
emanate chemical or radioactive pollutants or that biological
contaminants can be present in indoor air; 2) energy saving programs,
born in the seventies, led people to reduce the air exchanges
in indoor environments and 3) in urban areas most people spend
most of their time indoors at home or indoors elsewhere, that
is schools, offices, etc. In particular, for the Italian population,
in the frame of the recent representative National Survey on radon
indoors, data on the permanency indoors at home and indoors elsewhere
has been collected: it showed that on the average the Italian
population spends about 80% of its time in indoor environments
(F. Bochicchio et al., 1994a). As a development of the National
Survey, in the last years a pilot study was designed and is being
carried out in Rome (F.Bochicchio et al.1994b) to study the main
parameters influencing the exposure of radon and radon progeny
in domestic environments. Among these parameters natural ventilation
has been studied, because in most of the Italian houses forced
ventilation systems are very rarely used. For this reason the
detection of the eventual effective decrease of radon and radon
progeny concentration indoors due to natural ventilation could
have useful implication for domestic environments in temperate
climate areas, in search of a balance between energy conservation
and air exchange rates.

Abstract: In Portugal a national indoor radon survey was developed
by the Health Physics and Safety Department and some regions with
high indoor radon levels were identified. Actually some procedures
are being studied in order to reduce the indoor radon levels.
This paper refers two different situations. In the first case,
an experimental room was built and the walls were covered with
phosphogypsum which is sometimes employed as building material.
Integrated measurements had been performed with nuclear passive
track detectors, LR-115s, exposed for 1-2 month periods. Afterwards,
two types of wall coverings are being studies, with the purpose
to mitigate the increase of indoor radon due to the utilisation
of phosphogypsum employed as building material. The other situation
concerns the application of reduction techniques in a real dwelling
situated in a granitic and uranium mining region with high indoor
radon concentrations. In this case, the main radon source term
had been identified. Some mitigation procedures, including natural
ventilation, replacement of the floor with a vinyl material and
the wall cracks sealed were performed. In both cases, the different
steps concerning the reduction techniques studies are described
and the respective effectiveness evaluated.

Abstract: It is well recognised that greater part of environmental
radiation dose to human comes from natural radiation, while its
major contribution is from radon and its short-lived decay products
in air. Their inhalation can induce lung cancer which had brought
about popular notice. The effect of indoor radon and its daughters
in air on inhabitants' health is concerned as their main living
space is indoor. Indoor radon concentrations in air are approx
25 Bq/m3 under normal living conditions in China, i.e. doors and
windows are opened or closed normally. But it can vary due to
alter some housing conditions, such as fixing air conditioner
and so on. Along with the improvement of Chinese Peoples' living
standards, air conditioners have already come into population's
home right now. It has actual living standards, air conditioners
have already come into populations home right now. It has actual
meanings to study their affection on indoor radon level as a previous

Abstract: The indoor air quality IAQ is of fundamental importance
with regard to the evaluation and certification of healthy buildings.
Because only precise, accurate and statistically controlled analytical
results allow conclusions to be drawn about the quality of air
and the risks related to chemicals, quality assurance for air
analysis is the object of advanced research. The decrease of air
infiltration existing in modern buildings, due to the presence
of indoor sources of contaminants emitted by materials, the increase
of outdoor polluted air, and the problems related to ventilation
energy costs, assign a primary consideration in ventilation engineering.
Monitoring and controlling the mechanical ventilation is the main
reason to develop suitable sensors, since IAQ cannot be measured
objectively, the concept for acceptable air has been defined.
This applies to air which does not contain any known contaminants
in harmful concentrations and which is accepted without complaint
by more than 80% of those people exposed to it . Among organic
substances those with molecular weight greater than 300 are generally
odourless, and even if potent olfactory stimuli derived from some
substances can be perceived at very low concentrations, they may
not be detected by existing instruments. Olfactory sensitivity
often is able to detect potentially harmful substances at concentrations
below dangerous levels and therefore able to eliminate them. It
is important to consider odour as a IAQ indicator because a sensory
approach (odours and irritations) has a fundamental role for the
IAQ characterisation, being a complementary method of the traditional
physic, chemical and microbiological studies utilised to measure
the exposure (Kirchner et al., 1994). Odours and irritants thresholds,
however, because of a poorly available systematic review, may
vary by several orders of magnitude - and further studies must
be carried out in order to determine more precise indications.
Although the perceived indoor air quality presently can only bemeasured
by means of test subjects rather than with measuring instruments,
reference to this approach is nevertheless appearing in HVAC ventilation
standards (CEN, 1994); critical review showed that these standards
could be based on scientific definitions to allow measurable outcomes
indicating adverse effects on comfort, such as annoyance and irritation
as a function of dilution ventilation (Rehva, 1995). A look at
the limitations of present IAQ guidelines suggests a promising
alternative approach for judging the acceptability of IAQ based
on antropic gases (CO2 and/or NH3) monitoring as an integrated
measure of all airborne contaminants present in ambient air, to
do it the IAQ guidelines can be based on both specific contaminants
of pollutant mixtures and global presence of contaminants in the
mixtures (Light et al, 1992). The possibility to apportion contaminants
to major classes of emission sources, is generally obtained using
a sensory panel, CO and CO2 measurements. Many studies have apportioned
the perceived IAQ degradation to three categories: occupants,
smoking and building materials including HVAC system. CO serves
as a surrogate for cigarette smoking, CO2 for bioeffluents, but
presently only sensory measures can significantly indicate the
importance of the HVAC system and building materials as contaminant
sources (Fanger, 1988). Unfortunately, the relationship of the
sensory responses to physical-chemical measures is not clear.
In particular, nonlinearity and thresholds of sensory responses
should be taken into account when identifying sources quantitatively
(Batterman et al, 1995, Pejtersen et al, 1993). The concentration
of CO2 in a room remains a subjective variable for the evaluation
of IAQ, even though its value can be defined exactly. Except for
particular boundary conditions, no relationship (Persily, 1993)
can be found between the CO2 concentration in a room and the IAQ
perceived by the human nose. Otherwise, first one substance and
then another would dominate the sense of smell. It is therefore
of little significance to measure concentration of individual
gas selectively, leading to the assumption that the gas mixture
must be evaluated as a whole. That is what the mixed gas sensors
do.

Abstract: The use of non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) to measure
equilibrium carbon dioxide concentration, and hence to infer ventilation
rate, is rapidly gaining acceptance. However, other applications
use both the time-dependent and equilibrium carbon dioxide concentration
to determine other ventilation parameters including: tracing of
reintrainment routes, determining air-mix ratios, assisting in
commissioning and rebalancing of HVAC systems, performing walk-through
IAQ audits and checking for ventilation short-circuiting. The
common technology of NDIR offers its advantages and disadvantages
when compared with other technologies, especially electrochemical
cells which offer low power, fast response and better resistance
to shock and humidity. This paper compares the accuracy and ease
of use of these technologies in different applications.

Abstract: Healthy buildings are to a great extent a question of
indoor air quality. The processes involved in air quality can
be looked upon as a number of links in a chain. Typical links
will be emission from building materials, convection and diffusion
in the room, local airflow around a person, personal exposure
and at last the effect of the air quality on the occupant. The
best results will obviously be obtained by using building materials
with low emission. However, there will always exist some emission
and the ventilation will consequently be an important link. Aalborg
University has worked with several inks as shown in figure 1.
The elements in a model for emission from building materials (1)
will be discussed in the first chapter of this paper. Transport
by convection and diffusion (2) will be addressed in the following
chapter, and the flow around a person (3) will be handled in a
third chapter. An occupant's role as emission source (4) is described
by examples in the last chapter.

Abstract: Experiments on the adsorption/desorption of volatile
compounds on building materials have been performed in a 1 m3
dynamic chamber ventilated by clean air. Different types of materials
commonly found in buildings (glass plate, floor and wall coverings,
gypsum board and acoustic tiles) have been exposed to the vapour
of 2-butoxyethanol introduced in the chamber at constant concentration.
Both adsorption and desorption phases where followed under different
environmental conditions (16, 23 and 30 degrees C , 45 and 70%
RH). Mathematical modelling of the data has been used to describe
the observed sink phenomena. Except for the glass plate, 2-butoxyethanol
presents clear evidence of adsorption and desorption on all other
tested materials. Temperature and humidity significantly affect
these reactions. Complementary methods aimed at describing the
microphysical shape of the materials appear to be useful for the
evaluation of their adsorbing properties.

Abstract: In order to investigate the factors influencing air
quality inside hospitals, the concentration of atmospheric gases
and of pollutant vapours was monitored in air-conditioned and
naturally ventilated hospital buildings located in urban areas
with different vehicular traffic density. The quality of inside
air is strongly dictated by outside pollution, the latter mainly
depending on hospital position with reference to automotive sources,
as far as showed by measured CO and CO2 time profiles. CO2 indoor
pollution is mainly dependent from human presence and its effect
is particularly relevant in conditions of crowding and insufficient
ventilation of environments, where CO2 build-up higher than 3500
mg/m3 can cause subjective discomfort. Indoor pollution from volatile
organics can be traced to peculiar sources and is characteristic
of hospital activities, with respect to other collective buildings,
mainly due to the extensive use of cleaning products and sanitary
auxiliaries.

Abstract: The users and operators of hospitals have never been
more aware than they are now of the risk that patients and surgeons
may complain about the indoor climate, especially in operational
rooms. A substantial proportion of all new operational rooms created
in old buildings or in new buildings is in the category of 'problem
rooms'. About 80% of doctors are dissatisfied with indoor climate
conditions and they say that their success depends not only on
their ability but on indoor climate conditions as well. The more
operational rooms are old the more it seemed to lead to more complaints.
This situation is partially due to the fact that in the old operational
rooms is a mechanical ventilation without special equipment for
maintenance indoor climate conditions. There are more works closely
related to the air distribution systems for operational rooms.
A main subject of these works is due to air flow patterns for
operational rooms and to the equipment of the air distribution
system.

of the hospital air distribution systems. In the military hospital
in Warsaw not only surgeons complained about indoor climate, and
there was no temptation to prescribe them 'hypersensitivity' because
for the patient rooms there was the same dissatisfaction. One
of the most common complaints of indoors in winter was that the
air felt dry. It was decided that it was not a spread of rumour
but it was a problem, which has to be solved by the scientific
and technical approach. The central stations of the air conditioning
systems and main ducts were taken for the investigation.

Abstract: In wards used for Patients recovering from bone marrow
transplants, it is necessary to ensure a high degree of air cleanliness
inside the rooms. The patients themselves also have to be included
as sources of pathological agents. Differential pressurization
between zones of high and low contamination is necessary, and
a reliable differential pressurization can be obtained only by
means of a mechanical ventilation system and different flow rates
of supply and return air. A high degree of air sterility can be
obtained by introducing outdoor air into the occupied space after
adequate filtration. The paper compares three ventilation systems
in terms of energy consumption (thermal and electrical) and installation
costs.

a sizeable set of measurements concerning the air cleanliness
in the air-handling units and in the room supply terminals, upstream
of them and in the room immediately downstream. The instrumental
and operational accuracy, associated with the consistent procedure
of the data-logging operation, allow us to make comparisons between
the measurements, even if the applications were different. The
values monitored were: number of solid particles suspended in
the air, their distribution according to size and the bacterial

Abstract: The thermal conditions in a room with displacement flow

the displacement flow without a cooling ceiling. This article
aims to show the reason for the change of the flow field from
stratified to mixing flow and the consequences for concentration

Abstract: The energy and mass transfer in a ventilated room takes
a major influence on the temperature and mass (eg. particles,
gases, contaminants) distribution and thus on the thermal comfort
and air quality of the room occupants. There are important differences
between the different ventilation systems concerning the energy
and mass transfer. Especially for displacement flow the energy-
and mass transfer is considerable because there is a marked temperature-
and concentration distribution in the room. The aim of this investigation
is to show the different mechanisms which are responsible for
the temperature- and concentration distribution in rooms with
displacement flow.

Abstract: Displacement ventilation systems in German called 'Quelluftung'
become more and more popular and have proved themselves in many
different applications in comfort as well as in industrial air
conditioning systems. However, there are many uncertainties according
to the design of the systems. In a research project the basis
and the technical conditions had been worked out. The influence
of the air outlet and the heat sources on the temperature and
contaminant distribution within the room was investigated. Displacement
ventilation introduces supply air into the room at or near floor
level and at a temperature lower than that of the ambient room
air. The supply air thus fills the room from the floor up, displacing
the old air and any contaminants that it carried. Additional buoyancy
flows caused by heat sources are overlapping the displacement
flow. The buoyancy flow is greater than the displacement and this
causes the typical stratification of source flow. There is a layer
of supply air near the floor, upwards there is a layer of mixed
air, which is primarily influenced by the location and intensity
of the heat sources. Above the mixing zone there is another displacement
zone up to the ceiling, where the exhaust air is taken. When room
ventilation is by displacement, temperature and contaminant concentrations
increase with the height of the room. Without any heat sources,
this gradient would be uniform. However, in typical rooms, heat
sources such as people or equipment should cause convection currents
that result in the cleaner air near the floor being forced upward
into the breathing zone at a rate higher than the displacement
flow. The displacement flow rate should be lower than the convection
flow rate because maintaining a low velocity in the supply air
prevents drafts from becoming a problem. Displacement ventilation
flow rate should ideally remain below 0.2 metres per second.

Abstract: One reason for complaints about air-conditioning systems
in offices is draught. As a consequence of this, air-conditioning
systems were developed in which the inlet air streams slowly into
the room showing the following characteristics: low degree of
turbulence, low air velocity and low temperature at ground level.
The inlet air therefore forms a 'lake' of around heated bodies
by self-convection and are accordingly low. In order to facilitate
higher cooling loads, so-called 'ceiling-coolings' are used in
addition. The range of applicability of such air-conditioning
systems, with regard to thermal comfort, was investigated by the
Fraunhofer-Institut fur Bauphysik (IBP) and the results are described
in the paper. The main results are: 1. The air temperature at
foot level should not fall below a value of 22oC. 2. The operative
temperature at head level should not exceed a value of 24oC.

Abstract: Fifty six office buildings in nine European countries
were audited during the heating season of 1993-1994 (1) The audits
were performed according to a standard procedure, within the frame
of the 'European Audit project to optimize indoor air quality
and energy consumption in office buildings', sponsored by the
European Community through the Joule II programme. The main aim
of this EC-Audit was to develop assessment procedures and guidance
on ventilation and source control, which help to assure indoor
air quality and optimize energy use in office buildings. 15 institutes
from 11 countries (The Netherlands, Denmark, France, Belgium,
United Kingdom, Greece, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Germany
and Portugal) participated. By determining the pollution load
(chemically and sensory), the ventilation performance and the
energy consumption, and by identifying the pollution sources,
recommendations can be made to avoid excessive energy consumption
and ensure air quality by source control and ventilation. A common
agreed Europe-wide method to investigate indoor air quality in
office buildings, including a common agreed European questionnaire
and walk-through survey checklist were developed (2). This paper
presents the general results and recommendations of the audit
in 56 buildings in Europe. Detailed results and discussions can
be found in the final report (1).

Abstract: Fifty-six office buildings, selected in nine European
countries for being as far as possible representative of the building
stock, were audited between December 1993 and March 1994. These
audits were performed according to a standard procedure, within
the frame of the 'European Audit Project to Optimise Indoor Air
Quality and Energy Consumption in Office Buildings', part of the
JOULE Programme (CEC-DG XII). The main purpose of office buildings
is to provide a comfortable working environment for occupants.
This includes, among others, thermal, visual and acoustical comfort
as well as indoor air quality. One of the objectives of the survey
was hence to assess the actual quality of the indoor environment
in office buildings. Measured parameters concerning the quality
of indoor environment included occupant satisfaction, sick building
symptoms and concentration of contaminants. Yearly energy consumption
data were also gathered for each building. Ventilation performance
in terms of air flow rate and indoor air quality was compared
to a proposed European pre-standard and related to occupant satisfaction
and energy consumption. Theoretically, energy is required to control
the indoor climate and indoor air quality. Therefore, it is a
common perception that energy savings will result in a poorer
quality indoor environment. It was interesting therefore to relate
energy consumption to various parameters describing the indoor
environment. The results show that good indoor environment is
compatible with low energy consumption. Good quality energy services
do not necessarily incur a high energy use.

Abstract: The U.S. EPA's Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA)
has initiated a major study of indoor air quality (IAQ) to fill
a significant data gap that exists regarding baseline IAQ in public
and commercial office buildings. The goal of the study is to define
the status of the existing building stock with respect to IAQ
and occupant perception. The on-going cross-sectional study, entitled
Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) Program, is collecting
baseline data characterizing public and commercial office buildings.
The study buildings are randomly selected without regard to IAQ
complaints. Core parameters and measured in a representative space
in each building. This paper discusses the study design and the
building and study space selection. Summaries of building descriptions
and the results of measurements related to thermal comfort and
ventilation for the first thirteen buildings are also included.
The building descriptions include information about building age;
size; study area location within the building; heating, air-conditioning
and ventilation (HVAC) system type; occupant activities; smoking
policy; and percent outdoor air. The measurements related to thermal
comfort include indoor and outdoor temperatures and relative humidities.
The data collected are coded for confidentiality and are in a
publicly-accessible database. A separate paper (Part II) presents
the results of pollutant measurements and occupant perceptions.

Abstract: The effects of office furniture design and workstation

range of furniture configurations and environmental parameters
investigated included: 1) partition heights, 2) partition gap
size, 3) diffuser types, 4) supply air diffuser location relative
to the workstation, 5) return air grill location relative to workstation,
6) heat source locations, 7) presence of furniture, 8) supply
air temperatures, 9) adjacent workstations, 10) contaminant source
locations, 11) supply air flow rates, and 12) outdoor air flow
rates. The tracer gas technique was used to study experimentally
the relative impact of these parameters on the air distribution
and ventilation performance, as well as contaminant removal efficiency.
The results showed that the outdoor air flow rate had significant
influence on the mean age of air. The air distributions in all
the workstations were good even when the supply air flow rate
was relatively low (ie. 5 L/s). At the same time, most of the
parameters tested had significant influence on contaminant removal
efficiency when there was a contaminant source present somewhere
in the office.

presented various types of building characteristics such as ventilation
or air conditioning systems, indoor walls, floors, ceilings and

for questions related to indoor environment acceptability and
health symptoms. The questionnaire analysis showed two groups
of buildings with significant difference in prevalence of reported
symptoms which is discussed in the paper in relation to building
characteristics and ventilation rate. Health symptoms were also
found to be in correlation with indoor air acceptability rated
by occupants. Outdoor air flow rates were shown to be related

Abstract: In the framework of the 'European Audit Project to Optimize
Indoor Air Quality and Energy Consumption in Office Buildings'
detailed ventilation studies were planned to apply recently developed
measurement techniques in-situ and to validate their application
and utility. This field-testing was carried out in two office
buildings selected among the 56 European office buildings being
the subject of the IAQ audit in the project. The overall measurements,
carried out at building level in ventilation systems, proved to
be very relevant for understanding building operation. They are
the subject of this paper summarising the most import outcomes.
Detailed information can be found in the project final reports.
Both investigated buildings are equipped with very large balanced
ventilation systems (about 35,000 and 140.000 m/h). It is important
to mention that a high precision gas analyser was used (B &amp;
K type 1302) and that some measurements would probably not have
been possible with less accurate device.

Abstract: Recent rapid increases in global atmospheric contamination
levels, especially in metropolitan areas, lead to high attention
to indoor air qualities in commercial buildings located in the
polluted areas. One of the most common methods to provide office
workers with a clean and comfortable indoor air environment is
ventilation, in which a certain portion of the return air from
the interior spaces is replaced by outdoor air in the air handling
unit (AHU). Indeed, ventilation is the most effective method of
maintaining a high quality indoor air environment when the outdoor
air is fresher than the indoor air. However, ventilation usually
causes higher energy consumption in HVAC system due to the temperature
and humidity controls with the raw outdoor air. Therefore, it
is a key objective of this field study to identify the impact
of outdoor air intake rates at the air handling units on the indoor
air contaminant levels in commercial office buildings especially
located in metropolitan areas. A total of four commercial office
buildings located in Seoul, Korea and Tokyo, Japan were selected
for field measurements. The concentration levels of the indoor
air pollutants were monitored at different outdoor intake rates
and the odor and discomfort ratings were made by the occupants

Abstract: Allergies and over-sensitivities should be taken into
account as soon as a building is being designed. In fact, all
building should be done with the potentially most sensitive group
of users in mind, namely those suffering from respiratory ailments.
Since that group constitutes 25% of the Dutch population, the
above point of departure would seem quite reasonable. Dust deterrence
will be the theme of the present article.

Abstract: The office environment survey (Wilson and Hedge, 1987)
indicated that sick building syndrome was higher in all types
of public sector buildings compared to their private sector counterparts.
However, when public and private sectors occupied different floors
of the same building similar sickness rates were recorded. A public
sector organisation which occupied difference buildings, one naturally
ventilated, the other deep plan air conditioned had very different
sickness rates. In summary the authors (Wilson and Hedge, 1987)
concluded (Section 4.4) that: 'Further study on organisational
factors is certainly warranted....ultimately the quality of our
office stock reflects the policies and priorities of the organisations
occupying it'.

Abstract: The paper presents the main experimental methods for
the assessment of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and ventilation systems
performance in buildings, with special attention to large enclosures.
There are subjective methods, in which human beings are the objects
of measurements or act as 'Sensors' themselves, and objective
ones, that is, methods making use of experimental apparatuses.
Attention is drawn on the last ones and particularly on the techniques
based on gaseous pollutant concentration monitoring. The main
IAQ and ventilation performance indicators are presented and their
measurement techniques are described. Full scale experiments results
illustrate the application of the above mentioned techniques.

Abstract: Ventilation systems may act as important sources of
impurities in indoor air if they become contaminated with dust
or micro-organisms. This may pollute the supply of air. Construction
debris and processing oil residues are commonly found to exist
even in the ventilation ducts of new buildings. The average surface
density of dust settled in the supply air ducts of 14 Finnish
office buildings was found to be 13.2 g/m2 and the average annual
accumulation rate 1.8 g/m2. It contained 80% of inorganic material.
The average count of viable fungal spores was 3370 cfu/g. IN the
present studies, the surface density of dust settled in ventilation
ducts of single family houses was investigated. The ducts and
other parts of the ventilation systems were cleaned, ventilation
was balanced and small faults observed were repaired. Air flow
rates were measured before and after cleaning and other service
measures.

Abstract: Simulation of air infiltration and ventilation, and
heat transfer processes of buildings are combined in this building
simulation program called BUS. A network assumption is adopted
for both air flow and thermal simulation. An iterative method
is used for air flow simulation, and a heat balance method is
selected for thermal simulation. The program includes mass balance,
momentum, and heat balance equations. This makes it possible to
take into consideration the interaction between ventilation and
heat transfer processes, obtain more reliable simulation results
than earlier, and simulate time-dependent processes.

Abstract: When the task is to control the indoor exposure, it
is important to know how persons are exposed to a contaminant
source. Personal exposure to a contaminant depends on the ventilation
and the location of the source relative to the person. Previous
studies have shown that the exposure may differ more than one
order of magnitude due to different velocity fields (Brohus and
Nielsen, 1994). This fact stresses the importance of taking this
parameter into account when we want to control the exposure and
develop guidelines for exposure reduction. The objective of this
study has been to determine the personal exposure to a contaminant
source in a uniform velocity field. This was done by full-scale
measurements and computer simulations. The results showed a significant
dependence on the velocity field both regarding the direction
and the magnitude. The results also showed that the disturbance
created by a person in a flow field may be a very important factor
to consider, when the person is turning the back to the flow field.
It was found that the wake created behind a person was able to
entrain contaminants from a distance exceeding the usual operation
range. Guidelines for personal exposure reduction in a uniform
velocity field are discussed.

Abstract: Ducts with orifices reinforced with perforated sheet
are used frequently in ventilation systems. Design works concerning
ventilation systems require the knowledge of how orifice geometry
influences the velocity distributions of air flow as well as the
knowledge of local resistance coefficient. Most often, designers
assume that, if the shape of duct remains unchanged, the principle
of uniform productivity or constant outflow velocity on the whole
orifice length and width can be accepted. In the course of investigations
on a number of ventilation elements, it has been observed that
the above approach was much simplified. The investigations were
carried out for both, laboratory conditions and real ventilation
systems. The above observation was reason to undertake experimental
research in order to state how the size and different geometry
of orifice, reinforced with perforated sheet, influence the area
of velocity of outflowing air and local resistance coefficient.
The orifice was located on side wall of ventilation duct with
rectangular cross-section. Orifice was the last ventilation element
in the duct.

Abstract: External air treatment cost in building climatization
plant can be a considerable quota of the global annual management
charges. The possibility to reduce this cost then assumes fundamental
importance also for healthy requirements. In fact it can make
more proposable exchange rates greater than minimum standard ones
fixed by low with a real improvement of internal comfort conditions.
In this case psychometric processes of outside air normally involve
remarkable energy consumption for humidification during winter,
for dehumidification in summer and sometimes in spring and autumn.
Various innovative plant solutions have been therefore proposed
for these applications. The introduction of desiccant systems
and evaporative cooling can permit techniques alternative to the
traditional ones both in air conditioning and heating periods.
In particular the convenience and sometimes the necessity to use
chemical dehumidification is just well-known in some application
cases characterized by low thermal or humidity levels required.
In this paper suitable combinations of these two fundamental processes
are proposed and their performances are investigated for building
climatization purposes. Performance comparison between these techniques
and traditional ones is carried on by annual simulation of building-plant
systems in dynamic conditions for different climatic situations.

Abstract: The loads of building deciding of the air flows and
change are of different character and mostly depend on stack and
wind effect. The main ways to gain information about air change
rate are measurements and computer simulations based on various
building models. Measurement method (tracer gas and pressurization
tests) cannot be applied in simultaneous of vast inner areas characteristic
of multizone structures. Therefore, analytical methods based on
mathematical models of buildings and processes taking place in
them are most frequently used. These models divide the building
into a given number of zones (spaces) mutually combined. In most
cases, the division of a building usually consists in separation
of buildings with natural ventilation and where wind effect is
predominant. However, the results of the calculation do not conform
to the results of measurements made in selected spaces of existing
buildings. On the basis of such comparisons it has been assumed
that the air flow and change rate taken as average for a flat
is rarely representative of each of rooms located in this flat.
This conclusion has become the basic reason to make an attempt
of creating a new method of air flow prediction.

Abstract: A great deal of research has not gone into many aspects
of the problem of indoor air quality but it has been almost exclusively
at the purely technical level. Some of the health effects of various
pollutants have been determined and measurements taken in the
field to determine whether guidelines are exceeded. In some cases
control of emissions from materials have been proposed or ventilation
rates recommended to reduce pollution levels. Supporting work
has been carried out on modelling of pollutant emissions and absorption
and so on. Some work has been carried out on the interaction of
IAQ and energy. Little consideration has been given to the concept
of IAQ as an economic good, inevitably in competition for scarce
resource with other goods. It is the purpose of this paper to
apply elementary economic concepts to the question of Indoor air
Quality and ventilation in dwellings. Scientists, engineers and
other technical people often feel a sense of frustration in that
their seemingly logical advice is not followed. Often this is
because they fail to appreciate the winder dimensions, one of
which is economic, within which policy makers have to operate.
The purpose of this paper is to try to widen the debate about
IAQ to include at least one other dimension besides the purely
technical one. The paper is essentially conceptual and attempts
to apply a range of economic concepts and techniques to the problem
of indoor air quality.

Abstract: The distribution and conditioning of the air are significant
cost factors in the operation of ventilation and air conditioning
systems. Plant operating hours are normally kept under control
by the use of time switches or by manual operation. In most cases,
However, these methods by no means exploit the full potential
for a reduction in operating hours. Compared with conventional
methods of control, a far more significant reduction in operating
costs can be achieved by basing air renewal on actual (measured)
demand. The additional capital investment can be recouped within
1 to 5 years, the payback period depending primarily on the air
flow rate. At an air flow rate of 2000 m3/h, the payback period
is approximately 5 years, and falls, with increasing air flow
rates, to as little as under a year. In automatic mode, the air
quality control system switches the fan stages on and off or,
in the case of VAV systems, adjusts the fan speed or damper position.
Demand-based ventilation systems are not just restricted to new
systems; cost-effective conversion kits are available for existing
systems. In a converted system, manual and/or time-switch control
are replaced by an air quality control system. Other analogue
or digital controls (such as temperature) remain unaffected. On
the basis of empirical values, preset as parameters in the controller,
demand-based ventilation systems can be started automatically
at the touch of a button.

Abstract: It has become clear over recent years that the presence
of house dust mites exerts an influence upon the health of occupants.
Research has suggested that if house dust mite population is controlled,
then the incidence of asthma is reduced. The simplest way of achieving
this is to reduce indoor relative humidity levels. As part of
a continuing project (sponsored by the EATL Core Research Programme)
to compare the effectiveness of ventilation strategies in inhibiting
the growth of house dust mites, three ventilation systems were
installed in the EA Technology Ventilation Test House, and were
monitored over the winter of 1993/1994. Results are presented
for the variation in humidity levels between rooms for each ventilation
system. On the basis of the results obtained, mechanical ventilation
with heat recovery appears to be the most effective means of reducing
indoor humidity and in coping with peaks of moisture production.
When compared to passive stack ventilation, the heat recovery
capability of the mechanical system compensates for the associated
higher air change rates and the energy consumption associated
with fan operation.
