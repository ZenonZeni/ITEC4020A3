<H2>Cats - A Link With Rabies</H2>
</CENTER>

Why think about cats when it's fox and raccoon rabies we're facing in Ontario?<P>

While both foxes and raccoons are the primary carriers for those strains of rabies, cats provide a link for the transmission of rabies from foxes and raccoons to people.<P>

May is Rabies Awareness Month in Ontario and the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and its partners want to increase public knowledge of how to avoid rabies.<P>  

The ministry's Rabies Research Unit has been working since 1989 to eliminate the fox strain through an aerial baiting program.  MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies in Ontario by the year 2001.  Although there are no reported cases of the raccoon strain in Canada, it has slowly been working its way north through the United States and has now been found close to Ontario at the New York State border.  It could be a problem if it reaches Ontario, because the province has a large raccoon population.<P>

<B>The Trap-Vaccinate-Release Program</B><P>

Three of the most likely transmission routes by which infected racoons might enter the province are across the Niagara River, across the St. Lawrence River, or by accidental transport on trucks, trains, recreational vehicles or boats.<P>

The Rabies Research Unit has been working over the past few years to create a buffer zone against raccoon rabies between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal by immunizing raccoons through a trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program.  In 1995, the ministry created additional zones at bridges along the St. Lawrence River, where infected raccoons could easily cross from New York State.<P>

The TVR program uses humane live-traps to catch raccoons.  The animals are vaccinated, then marked with an ear-tag and released.  The ministry hopes that by doing this, the spread of raccoon rabies can be contained or slowed if it comes into the province.<P>


										
<B>Protect your pets</B><P>

If raccoon rabies reaches Ontario, cats in the outbreak area present a potential risk to public safety because of their close association with both raccoons and people. <P>

Pet owners, and anyone who comes into contact with cats, should take steps to protect their pets and family.<P>

Many people keep their cats indoors during the day, but let them outside at night. This is when they are most likely to come into contact with raccoons, who also prowl at night.  Both often frequent the same areas.  Rabies experts encourage people to keep their cats confined or on a leash, especially during the evening.  In many municipalities, this is already mandatory.<P>

It is very important that pet owners make sure their cats (or dogs) have been vaccinated so they do not catch and pass on rabies. <P>

Most pet cats in Ontario are vaccinated.  However, there is also a problem with barn cats and feral cats (unowned cats who live in the wild). <P> 

Barn cats are usually very hard to catch, and therefore are not often vaccinated.  Wild cats present a special problem because they don't have  owners who can have them vaccinated.  The exact number of feral cats is unknown, but there are many who live throughout the province in rural areas, on farms and in cities.<P>
  
To make sure your pet cat is not mistaken for a feral cat, get it a collar so it can be identified as having had a vaccination.  A collar, or other means of identification should also have your telephone number on it.<P>

<B>Protect Yourself</B><P>

The best way to protect yourself, your family and your pets from all strains of rabies is to have your pets vaccinated, keep away from stray or wild animals, and call your doctor if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal.<P>

Humans and animals can become infected with rabies by saliva from a rabid animal coming into contact with a cut or scratch, or in contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes.<P>

Any direct contact with a wild animal needs to be taken seriously even if an animal appears to be healthy.  Rabies incubate in a raccoon for some time before symptoms appear.<P>

If you think you or a member of your family has been in contact with a rabid animal, wash the affected skin thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap and hot water and contact your doctor or local health department immediately.<P>

										.
Anyone who is exposed to rabies must be treated immediately.  Rabies is fatal if untreated.  The treatment which is safe and effective is usually a series of five injections given over a one-month period.<P>



<B>Detecting Rabies in Animals</B><P>

Rabid animals may become depressed and retreat to isolated places.  Wild animals, especially skunks, lose their fear of humans.  The animals may show signs of paralysis such as abnormal facial expressions, drooping heads, sagging jaws or paralysed hind limbs.<P>

Some animals may show extreme excitement and aggression.  They may gnaw and bite their own limbs, and may attack stationary objects or other animals.  Bouts of aggressive, rabies-induced behaviour often alternate with periods of exhaustion and depression.<P>

If you see an animal that is acting strangely, you should report it to your municipal animal control agency, humane society or the police.<P>
