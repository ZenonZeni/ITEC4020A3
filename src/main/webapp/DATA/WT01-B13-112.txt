The most distinctive feature of the world's financial markets this
autumn is their capacity for accepting increased political risks
in the pursuit of higher asset returns. <I>Financial markets in
countries as diverse as New Zealand, Italy and the Ukraine are
experiencing rallies which suggest that the world is awash with
surplus liquidity and that investors believe the commitment to
liberal economic reform which swept the Anglo-Saxon world after
the first Thatcher election victory of 1979 is immune to electoral
reversals. </I>
<P>
After ten years of supporting one of the world's most aggressive
economic liberalization programs, the voters of New Zealand have
elected a new parliament in which three left of center and populist
political parties will have 55% of the seats. Yet instead of declining,
New Zealand's debt and equity markets rallied on the perception
that the election will probably be irrelevant to the country's
economic performance. Optimists believe that the forces of the
post cold war global marketplace are too powerful for any new
left-wing government to restore New Zealand's pre-1984 tradition
of protectionism and lavish welfare spending. A few pundits even
hope that the election has left the parliament so fragmented that
it will be impossible for the parties to form an effective government.
The 1996 New Zealand election was the first held under the country's
new system of proportional representation and thus encouraged
far more fragmentation than the traditional Westminster system
of electing M.P.'s (single member seats awarded to the candidate
with a plurality of votes).
<P>
In early October, the international credit rating agencies gave
Russia a series of ratings which ranged from BB+ (IBCA) to BB-
(S&amp;P 500) with Moody's in the middle at BA2. Such ratings
place Russia towards the upper end of the Brady bond market, ahead
of Brazil but still below Poland. There is little doubt that Russia
will someday deserve a high credit rating. It has immense natural
resources, a low ratio of government debt to GDP and during the
decade before 1914 was one of the world's high growth economies
and large scale capital importers. But the decision to award such
a high credit rating when Russia's political situation is in a
state of flux provides further confirmation of the financial community's
increasing tolerance for risk. Meanwhile, the improvement in Russia's
credit rating has caused such a large rally in Russian debt prices
that adventuresome investors are now shifting capital from the
Russian securities market to the Ukraine. The economic reform
program in the Ukraine has been lagging far behind Russia's, so
the yield on Ukrainian government debt was still above 70% in
September. But as a result of the flight from quality in Russia,
yields on Ukrainian Treasury bills have plunged to barely 50%
during the past two weeks despite a projected inflation rate of
112% this year. Russia's yields also have stabilized at about
50-55% compared to 150-200% during the spring.
<P>
The bond markets of Italy and Spain have also experienced major
rallies since August in the expectation that European governments
will introduce a broad based monetary union in 1999 despite the
failure of several countries to comply with the spirit, if not
the letter, of the Maastricht terms for economic convergence.
The yield gap between German and Italian bonds has fallen from
650 basis points eighteen months ago to just over 200 basis points
today. <I>Investors have bid up the price of Italian securities
in the expectation that German politicians will permit Italy to
enter the monetary union in 1999 despite the fact that the country's
ratio of public debt to GDP is almost 120% compared to a Maastricht
target of 60%.</I> The market's new optimism about Italy's entry
to EMU is based on the fact that the German officials appear willing
to accept liberal interpretations of the Maastricht agreement
for France and Belgium. They are permitting France to achieve
its deficit target through one time revenue transfers from the
pension funds of state enterprises. They seem willing to let Belgium
enter the union despite the fact that her ratio of public debt
to GDP exceeds 100%. In recent days, Bundesbank officials and
members of the Social Democratic Party responsible for monitoring
monetary policy have begun to suggest that they will not encourage
entry for countries which engage in accounting adjustments to
reduce their fiscal deficit to 3.0% of GDP. But investors have
not focused on these objections because of hopes that they will
at most delay EMU entry for Spain and Italy by two or three years,
not postpone it until all the Maastricht conditions are satisfied.
While German officials can persuade their public to accept Belgian
membership at the start of EMU, Italy is too large a country to
enter under current circumstances despite the fact that Italy
was among the original six countries which signed the Treaty of
Rome creating the European Common Market in 1958.
<P>
When one considers the resilience of the New Zealand financial
market and the aggressive investor demand for bonds in Europe's
peripheral debt markets during recent weeks, it is not surprising
that the Dow Jones Industrial average has reached new highs during
October. The outlook for the U.S. economy is still benign. The
markets have been discounting a Clinton victory in the presidential
election for several weeks while investors remain hopeful that
the Republicans will retain at least a narrow majority in both
houses of the Congress.
