FAY'S DRUGS: FIT TO BE SWALLOWED?

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

The ``shakeout'' investors--who buy into companies whose industries are in
the throes of consolidation--are convinced that Fay's (FAY), the nation's
13th-largest drugstore chain, is ripe for picking. The shares have dropped
to 7, down from 9 3/8 in late April, partly because of investors'
disappointment that a rumored takeover has not yet materialized. And a
flurry of yearend tax-loss sell-offs may be adding to the downward
pressure.
But the focus, insists one big investor, should be on what's happening to
all drug chains. ``A shakeout in the industry is under way,'' notes analyst
Maurice Levenson of Value Line. This is being fostered, he explains, by the
emergence of managed-health-care plans and stiff competition from giant
discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores and Target Stores. Analysts note the
industry could also shed a lot of duplication and costs by buyouts of
weaker companies. A recent example is Rite Aid's agreement to acquire Revco
for $1.8 billion.
   Fay's--with its sales sluggish, its earnings down, and the stock on the
ropes--is regarded as one of the industry's weak sisters. ``It's similar to
the Revco situation. The likes of such possible suitors as Walgreen's could
swallow it up just like that,'' says investment manager Mike Kicera of MRK
Capital Management.
   Kicera figures that Fay's shares are worth 12 to 15 in a buyout--based
on what Rite Aid agreed to pay for Revco. With 276 outlets in New
Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, Fay's is streamlining its
operations by getting rid of noncore businesses. It sold off Wheels
Discount Auto Supply Div. to Sears Roebuck's Western Auto Supply for $37
million. Management is also expected to unload the 30 Paper Cutter
discount-office-supply stores.
   ``Without Wheels and Paper Cutter, Fay's would be a much more attractive
takeover target,'' says one money manager accumulating shares.
   Providing added inducement for Fay's to sell: Management and directors
own about 31% of the stock--including the holdings of the family of
Chairman Henry Panasci Jr. Fay's didn't return calls.

THE WAY THE OLD RUBBER CRUMBLES

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

Not everything in today's hot IPO market is Internet-related. One issue
that some pros like--GreenMan Technologies (GMTI)--is nowhere near
cyberspace: It's in tire recycling. GreenMan went public on Oct. 3 at 5 a
share. On opening day, the stock jumped to more than 8 and stayed there for
eight trading days--until profit-taking spoiled some of the fun. But some
money managers still think it's worth loading up on GreenMan--now at 6.
   What's the allure of tire recycling? GreenMan uses a patented cryogenic
(low-temperature) technology to make used tires brittle, thus yielding
crumb-rubber granules. These granules are a low-cost source of rubber and
plastic waste, according to one money manager who has a sizable stake.
GreenMan's chief product is a proprietary thermoplastic rubber material
that uses crumbs from discarded tires. GreenMan uses it to produce water
filters, pumps, stereo components, and computer accessories.
   On Dec. 14, Browning-Ferris Industries, a major player in solid-waste
collection and recycling, signed an exclusive contract for GreenMan to
build and operate a crumb-rubber processing facility on Browning's site in
Jackson, Ga. It will convert a minimum of 32,000 tons a year of shredded
tires into high quality crumb rubber. Browning-Ferris may buy an equity
stake in GreenMan, speculates one analyst.
   Revenues for the year ending May 31, 1996, are expected to be $7 million
to $10 million, in part from a $2 million contract with Coca-Cola--for
GreenMan to make display racks of recycled rubber. One analyst sees
GreenMan going into the black in 1996.

CHINA TIRE MAY BE UNDULY DEFLATED

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

On the Big Board, China Tire Holdings (TIR) behaves as if it were a
retread. In early summer, shares of this major Chinese tiremaker were
around 12. They're now at 6, and even Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating
in November to ``neutral'' from an earlier ``buy.'' That's quite a blow:
Morgan Stanley was one of China Tire's major underwriters when it went
public--in July, 1993, at 17 a share. And it owns 5.7% of the stock.
Constantly shifting U.S.-China relations are part of the Street's aversion
to the stock. And there has been concern about China Tire's earnings
predictability.
   But not everyone is down on the stock. Investment manager Bill Harnisch
has been buying since the stock hit 8 in September--and bought even more
when it dropped to 6. How come?
   ``For a company with an estimated book value of more than $15 a share,
the stock is very cheap,'' says Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff, a
New York investment firm managing about $3 billion. And in spite of the
poor performance of most other Chinese tire biggies--caused in part by a
drop in car sales--China Tire's revenues in most of 1995 jumped by more
than 33%, and its earnings grew by 10%, he notes. Harnisch estimates 1995
earnings at 50 cents a share. For 1996, he foresees earnings of 75 cents.
   And then, there is the ``bonanza that we expect China Tire could win
from its lawsuit filed against Goodyear in the U.S.,'' says Harnisch. China
Tire claims that Goodyear interfered with its contract to buy a radial-tire
factory in China owned by Dalian General Rubber Factory: Goodyear bought
the factory instead. Some analysts believe Goodyear Tire & Rubber faces a
$3 billion penalty if it loses the legal fight.

A TOUGH YEAR TO FOLLOW

By:
Edited by Mark N. Vamos

Executives at America's largest public companies see the economy cooling a
bit in the coming year. They're a tad less optimistic than they were this
time last year. Fewer expect growth in gross domestic product to pick up in
1996, and the number anticipating rising unemployment has doubled. But
managers cheer the Fed: Their inflation fears have all but vanished, and
few worry about rising interest rates. A remarkable 91% give Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan high marks, compared with the 26% who applaud Clinton's
handling of the economy.

Survey of 401 senior executives drawn from the BUSINESS WEEK 1000.
Interviews were conducted for BUSINESS WEEK Nov. 30-Dec. 15, 1995 by Louis
Harris & Associates Inc. Previous surveys cited were of 400 senior
executives on Nov. 28-Dec. 5, 1994 and of 402 senior executives Dec. 10-20,
1993.

will go up, go down, or stay the same over the next 12 months?

               1995    1994    1993

CRUISE CONTROL?
Car sales should remain strong, though high sticker prices are worrisome

By:
By Kathleen Kerwin and Keith Naughton in Detroit


Peter Dirisamer may not drive home a new car in 1996. Dirisamer, 37, an
Elmhurst (Ill.) technical writer, wants to replace his family's 1988
Plymouth Horizon subcompact. But with average new-car prices pushing
$20,000, he's not finding much he can afford. ``Detroit expects me to pay
$20,000 for the average four-door sedan?'' he sniffs. ``I don't think so.''
Instead, he may settle for a used car.
   Consumers such as Dirisamer are the reason Detroit is cautious about its
prospects for the new year. ``Price is the issue with customers,'' says
Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Joseph Phillippi. And with a flood of two- and
three-year-old cars and trucks coming back on the market as their leases
expire--2.3 million in 1996 alone, according to Art Spinella of CNW
Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore.--consumers are finding plenty of
alternatives to pricey new wheels.
   So Detroit is prepared to idle along at about the same rate as the
overall economy. Auto executives are looking for only a modest improvement
of less than 2% over 1995's U.S. sales of 14.8 million cars and light
trucks. Says General Motors Corp. Chairman John F. Smith Jr.: ``1996 looks
like a good year, not spectacular.''
   Perhaps, too, Detroit is a bit cautious about predicting rosy sales. A
year ago, its optimism had reached fever pitch. But by mid-January,
consumers began to cool on auto buying as they felt the cumulative effect
of interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Sales revived by fits and
starts through 1995, ending about 2.6% behind 1994's pace.
GOOD AS IT GETS? Auto sales should be helped in 1996 by low interest rates,
which make auto loans and lease terms more attractive. A continuing
appetite for American-made trucks, including minivans and sport utilities,
also is in Detroit's favor. And the Big Three are introducing a host of new
models, notably Ford's Escort small car and F-series pickup, GM's new
midsize cars and minivans, and Chrysler's Dodge Dakota pickup.
   Still, other worries loom. PaineWebber Inc. analyst Michael Ward frets
about unsold cars and trucks on dealer lots, which reached a 75-day average
supply late in 1995, 14% above year-ago levels. Ward predicts little change
in sales for 1996: ``This is as good as it's going to get for Detroit.''
   While most on Wall Street predict slightly stronger sales ahead, they
don't expect them to flow straight to the bottom line. Customers are
demanding cash rebates and sweet lease terms on all but the hottest-selling
trucks. Flemington (N.J.) car dealer Steve Kalafer, who owns 23
dealerships, says the only thing selling these days is bargains: ``In a
world full of wonderful products, the consumer is buying the deal.''
   That squeezes auto makers' profit margins. ``The industry's margins are
a disaster for an expansion,'' says Paul Ballew, chief economist for J.D.
Power & Associates Inc. Adding to the uncertainty, Detroit's contracts with
the United Auto Workers expire in September. A spirited debate is expected
about the auto makers' shifting jobs to outside suppliers (box). And
Japanese competitors are hard on Detroit's bumper: introducing snazzy new
vehicles while keeping price increases small.
   Ford's costs of launching its many new vehicles will continue to drag
down profits during the first half of the year, company executives say.
Stockholders remain anxious about the company's strategy of loading on
features to lure import-loving baby boomers at a time when consumers shun
higher sticker prices. Ford also will expand its ambitious global
reorganization--dubbed Ford 2000--by folding South America, New Zealand,
Australia, and Taiwan into its combined North American and European
operations in 1996. J.P. Morgan & Co. analyst David Bradley expects Ford to
earn $3.6 billion, unchanged from 1995, on sales of $123 billion.
   General Motors Corp., which sat out most of 1995 without new models,
launches a series of important vehicles this year. After bungling several
car launches in recent years, it has been working on debugging its
manufacturing process to prepare for the launches. GM is counting on such
entries as the new Chevy Venture minivan, Buick Regal, and Pontiac Grand
Prix to help it regain its footing in crucial market segments. The company
is hoping its falling market share finally has bottomed. Late in the year,
its share edged above 34%, up from lows near 32%. GM will earn $7 billion,
up 17%, on $160 billion of sales, Bradley calculates.
``IDEAL SITUATION.'' Chrysler Corp. management, which just successfully
introduced a new generation of its bread-and-butter minivans, is likely to
spend plenty of time planning for a spring showdown with billionaire
investor Kirk Kerkorian. If Chrysler balks at giving Kerkorian aide Jerome
B. York a board seat, a nasty proxy battle will ensue. Back on the plant
floor, Chrysler is standardizing manufacturing processes and modernizing
older factories. Bradley estimates 1996 Chrysler earnings of $3.1 billion,
up 58% from the depressed 1995 level, on sales of $54 billion.
   Even as Detroit rolls out spiffy new models, its Japanese rivals will
unveil their own new designs. And while a sky-high yen forced them to boost
sticker prices, putting them at a $2,000 to $3,000 per-car price
disadvantage, they've been slashing costs. The 1997 Toyota Camry midsize
sedan is expected to cost as much as $1,000 less than the current car.
``The Japanese manufacturers have not gone away,'' says GM's Smith. ``They
are tough competitors, and they will continue to be.''
   Japan also is expanding its lower-cost U.S. production--and even
stepping up shipments of American-built cars to Japan. ``We are importing,
not only to Japan but to 38 countries, from the U.S.,'' says Nobuhiko
Kawamoto, Honda Motor Co. president and chief executive. ``We intend to
reinforce this plan.'' Even softening in the yen last fall isn't likely to
cause Japan to back off from cost-cutting. Says Ford Chairman Alexander J.
Trotman: ``I doubt very much that they will take their foot off the pedal
just because the yen has slipped back.''
   There is a silver lining to the slackening of 1994's breakneck pace.
Back then, factories were running at maximum overtime, some key parts ran
short, and demand for raw materials renewed some inflationary pressures.
Says Kenneth L. Way, chairman and CEO of Lear Seating Corp. in Southfield,
Mich.: ``I think it's an advantage not to have deep troughs and big
peaks.''
   Instead, the industry may be bumping along on a plateau of 14.5 million
to 15.5 million unit sales annually. ``It's actually an ideal situation,''
says Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton. ``It allows you to get your plants
running at maximum efficiency, get your material flowing nice and evenly,
and really focus on costs and quality.''
   And when it comes to expansion opportunities, the Big Three are casting
their eyes toward the Asia-Pacific region, where they can still turn out
basic cars on a shoestring. ``That is where most of our growth focus will
be in the next 20 years,'' says Ford's Trotman. Chrysler, which has lagged
its Detroit peers abroad, is likely to make some major international moves
this year. The company is talking with a half-dozen potential partners in
India, South America, and Southeast Asia. An alliance with a European auto
maker could also be in the cards.
   Overseas horizons may indeed appear the brightest to Detroit. Especially
if American consumers, such as Illinois car shopper Dirisamer, remain
convinced that new cars cost too much.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Lower interest rates make auto loan and lease payments more
affordable.
   -- A flood of products--Ford's Escort and new pickup and GM's family
sedans--should whet consumer appetites.

Negatives
   -- Cost-cutting and a weaker yen are making the Japanese tougher
competitors than ever.
   -- Price-conscious consumers are demanding deals.

A SHRINKING SUPPLY OF SUPPLIERS

By:
By Kathleen Kerwin and Bill Vlasic in Detroit

American auto makers will rely on fewer parts suppliers in 1996. Ford Motor
Co., for example, has reduced its stable from 10,000 to 2,300--and aims for
1,150 by decade's end. At the same time, Detroit has suppliers building a
larger percentage of the content of its cars than ever.
   What gives? The consolidation is driven by auto makers who lean on
suppliers to provide entire systems for vehicles--an entire dashboard, for
instance, instead of just the ashtray that goes into it. Detroit is handing
off more development responsibility to suppliers, too. This favors those
companies with plentiful capacity, capital, and skills. Smaller players
must merge or lose the business. Some become second- or third-tier
suppliers to the remaining giants.
   The Big Three want global supply networks. A supplier who aspires to
U.S. business in 1996 may have to be able to deliver the same parts to
factories in Germany or Brazil. Among those that analysts say may grow by
acquisition in 1996: Borg-Warner Automotive, Dana, and Lear Seating. Says
TRW Inc. Chairman Joseph T. Gorman: ``There will continue to be massive
[supplier] consolidation as markets that were once national or regional
become global.''
   Big suppliers will end up with some extra burdens. ``The cost pressures
on suppliers are still tremendous,'' says Kenneth L. Way, chairman of Lear
Seating Corp. in Southfield, Mich. ``You have to share engineering costs
and design costs if you're a tier-one [supplier].'' And auto makers keep
demanding price reductions. The focus of supplier ire for 1996 is Ford
purchasing chief Carlos E. Mazzorin, who wants suppliers to cut their
prices by 5% a year.
   Even so, Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst Stephen Volkmann projects
suppliers' earnings will rise 15% to 20% in 1996. Price increases for raw
materials have eased lately, he notes. Suppliers of car parts may suffer
spotty slowdowns, but business in truck components should remain robust.
And Japanese car companies' expansion in the U.S. provides new market
opportunities for the best U.S. suppliers.

THEY'RE HAVING A CAPITAL TIME
Savoring solid demand here, machine makers also are expanding abroad

By:
By Zachary Schiller in Cleveland


Business investment has powered the U.S. economic expansion, and that has
made machinery executives a bunch of happy campers. Shipments of industrial
machinery and equipment were up 12% through October, 1995, from a year
earlier, according to the U.S. Census, surging toward a likely record.
Their plump backlogs almost guarantee another strong year. Says Jeffery T.
Grade, chairman of Milwaukee's Harnischfeger Industries Inc., which makes
equipment for papermaking and mining: ``1996, when all is said and done,
will be a very good year for most industrial manufacturers.''
   While growth and profits won't climb much in 1996, the gains come on top
of a strong base. That's because U.S. manufacturing is itself in good
shape--and companies are convinced that they must invest to stay that way.
``All in all, people are concerned about productivity and being competitive
globally,'' says Daniel J. Meyer, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron Inc.
   A healthy U.S. market should be supplemented by faster market growth
abroad. ``Our biggest opportunity for [profit] leverage is the continued
accelerated growth overseas,'' says Thomas F. McBride, chief financial
officer at Ingersoll-Rand Co. He's especially hopeful for Asia and the
Pacific. Ingersoll is looking to add three joint ventures in China to the
three it already has there, including one that makes industrial air
compressors and another producing rock drills for mining and road-clearing.
ITT Industries Inc.'s Fluid Transfer Div. is putting a warehouse for its
pumps in Santiago, Chile. Milacron, which just started making small
injection-molding machines in a joint venture with an outfit based in
India, hopes to be producing 600 there annually within a few years.
MASS APPEAL. More machinery makers are realizing they have to intensify
global activities to keep their U.S. customers happy. ``When a DuPont or a
Dow says, `I'm building my next plant in China--I need you to step up your
capabilities,' you've got to have mass to cover the world,'' says William
M. Jordan, president of Duriron Co., a Dayton (Ohio) pump and valve maker. 
Partly with that in mind, Duriron recently bought seal maker Durametallic
Corp.
   Also fueling mergers--including Ingersoll-Rand's 1995 takeover of Clark
Equipment Co.--is that stronger balance sheets have left more machinery
makers in a position to make purchases. Indeed, there even have been some
initial public offerings in the once beleaguered machine-tool business,
such as a 1995 IPO by Hardinge Brothers Inc., a fast-growing Elmira (N.Y.)
producer of lathes and machining centers.
   Such has been the strength of machine-tool sales that the average age of
U.S. metalworking equipment began falling in 1994 for the first time in 14
years. The rejuvenation should continue into 1996.
   Even if demand dips next year for a number of machinery makers, existing
orders will provide a cushion. For instance, Alton J. Brann, chairman and
CEO of Western Atlas Inc., notes that an ``exceptional year'' of bookings
means a good outlook for 1996 sales of its Industrial Automation Group. Its
backlog for machining and other systems is up about 50% from the $415
million of a year ago.
   There are some streaks of weakness in this rosy-hued picture. The same
globalization that has U.S. executives rushing to expand abroad means
they're facing more competition. And the same modernization that makes
American manufacturers world-beaters in productivity often has led to
increases in capacity that put a damper on prices.
BUYING MOOD. What's more, there are spotty signs of a slowdown in demand.
Manufacturers' use of their factory capacity fell from 85.1% a year ago to
83.1% in November, 1995. Orders for forklift trucks, industrial air
compressors, and large plastic-molding machines have slowed in recent
months. Demand from the auto industry may taper off, and 1995's sluggish
housing market will probably mean at best a flat market for construction
equipment this year.
   Still, most machinery customers are in a buying mood. Such businesses as
chemicals, paper, metals, and food should still spend smartly. Aerospace
demand is finally rebounding. And one of the biggest stars is likely to be
farm machinery. ``The underlying fundamentals for farm equipment have never
been stronger,'' says Ted French, chief financial officer of Case Corp.,
citing strong farm income and the lowest carryover of grain stocks in 30
years. For machinery makers, the wheels are turning for a solid 1996.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Outsourcing by big companies means job shops will be buying
equipment.
   -- With manufacturers concerned about global competition, they will
continue placing orders for machinery.

Negatives
   -- There's still too much worldwide capacity in sectors such as pumps
and machine tools, keeping prices down.
   -- Automotive capital spending will flatten out in 1996.

METALS NEED A FEW SUPPORT BEAMS
For steelmakers, falling prices and labor issues loom large in '96

By:
By Stephen Baker in Pittsburgh


At the dawn of 1995, Matthew Botsford, chairman of World Class Steel, was
confidently raising money to build a $450 million minimill near Pittsburgh.
If anyone epitomized America's resurgence in the steel industry, it was
Botsford, an entrepreneur who had built a successful $20 million
steel-finishing business and was following in the footsteps of Andrew
Carnegie.
   These days, Botsford is an ex-executive. He's suing his old
company--after being ousted during a November board meeting and whisked
from the building by a security guard. His project had the backing of
banks, suppliers, and the state government. But Botsford had trouble
convincing equity investors--and ultimately his board--that a new minimill
could make money in a climate of falling steel prices.
   In the end, Botsford fell with a tumbling steel market. In 1995, as
demand dropped from 114 million to 110 million tons, prices plummeted, too:
Flat-rolled steel plunged from $440 to $355 per ton. Other products, such
as structural beams, thrived. But because flat-rolled is widely used in
cars, appliances, and other products, it accounts for half of steel sales
and defined the year. ``When we cut flat-rolled prices, it was on page A1
[of the paper],'' laments Nucor Corp. President John D. Correnti. ``When we
raised prices of structurals, it was on C4.''
WILD CARD. The industry could wind up on page one again this year, with
even worse news. Executives see unchanging demand in 1996. A lower level of
inventories to start the year will help avoid a replay of 1995's heavy
price-cutting. But new steelmaking capacity coming onstream will put
further downward pressure on prices, especially in the commodity grades of
steel. ``The low end of the market is going to be tough for a while,'' says
Roy G. Dorrence, vice-president for operations at U.S. Steel Group.
   The wild card this year is overseas. U.S. producers hope strong growth
in China will translate into a buying binge reminiscent of 1993. But the
key factor for 1996 will be Europe. It was a vital prop under American
steel during the first half of 1995--but then buckled at midyear. If a weak
European economy prompts producers there to step up exports, cheap European
steel could undercut U.S. producers' prices and lead to fresh trade
squabbles.
   The biggest problem for U.S. producers is homegrown, however. Before
last year's price drop, a minimill-building boom was well under way. The
new mills could add 12 million tons of low-cost flat-rolled steel to
production capacity in 1996 and 1997 combined. That's nearly five times the
capacity added in 1995. If flat-rolled could crash last year in a
relatively strong economy, what will happen to the market in a downturn,
especially when new mills come onstream? ``That's when we'll have our death
spiral,'' predicts PaineWebber Inc.'s Peter Marcus, who expects lower
profits in 1996 and an even greater crash later this decade.
STRIKE BAN. As if economic prospects weren't intimidating enough, labor
questions loom. Most integrated companies face mid-contract
wage-and-benefit negotiations in 1996. Strikes or lockouts are prohibited.
But concessions granted by arbitrators could eat into earnings.
Job-security clauses in these contracts limit the big mills' power to cut
labor costs. Instead, the producers improve yields by tweaking the
technology. In the past three years, they have added 4 million tons--the
equivalent of Nucor's entire flat-rolled production--through this so-called
capacity creep. Log one more factor in an eventual glut.
   With a world oversupply, steel faces a dilemma just like the one U.S.
aluminum makers wrestled with early in the decade. But aluminum companies,
swamped with cheap Russian metal, shuttered 30% of production and
negotiated an OPEC-style allotment plan. Prices recovered smartly in 1995,
as massive world inventories shrank by 75%. U.S. demand rose 5%, with sales
rising to 15.5 billion pounds. Aluminum looks strong again in 1996, led by
a recovery in aerospace demand. But can prices remain firm if aluminum
makers reopen shuttered smelters? For now, executives don't even mention
the possibility, for fear of spooking the market.
   In the face of such difficult markets, metal industries are more and
more battling to take business away from one another. Auto hoods,
tailpipes, and even beer cans are among the contentious areas. And if
unexpectedly slow growth in China, Europe, or the U.S. brings about a steel
glut ahead of schedule, the metal wars could grow very nasty.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Demand for steel remains hearty.
   -- World inventories of aluminum have fallen 80% in the past 1 1/2
years.
   -- China may return as a big customer of American steel.

Negatives
   -- New steel capacity coming onstream is undermining prices.
   -- With higher aluminum prices, producers may restart idle smelters.
   -- Labor concessions could hurt steel earnings.

READY-ALL JOIN ARMS
Cash-Rich and eager to merge, defense companies are thriving

By:
By Eric Schine in Los Angeles


Financially speaking, small has been beautiful for the defense industry.
For two years, defense companies have produced record profits and soaring
stock prices while merging into a smaller, more efficient industry with
fewer, bigger players. Year three of Operation Consolidation will bring
even more mergers. ``Everybody is talking to everybody,'' says C. Michael
Armstrong, chief executive of GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
   Driving the consolidation is a persistent squeeze by the Pentagon. In
1996, procurement outlays should shrink an additional 9%, to $49.7
billion--a drop of nearly 50% from the 1987 peak spending year. And despite
years of contraction, the industry must still reduce capacity by as much as
40% over the next several years, according to Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst
with BT Securities Corp. Arms exports will help, as the industry's share of
the world market, now about 52%, should grow modestly. But the biggest
gains may be logged by companies pushing forward in promising commercial
ventures, some based on defense technology.
   Leading the consolidation charge will be a handful of large contractors.
Analysts predict at least one more merger on the scale of last year's
Lockheed Martin Corp. marriage, which created a $23 billion giant.
Companies have built cash hoards as a result of cutting costs even faster
than the Pentagon reduced spending, leaving GM Hughes, Litton, Loral, and
others poised to buy.
MARRIAGE-MINDED. Makers of missiles, electronics, and airframes are in
demand. Raytheon Co. purchased the fast-growing E-Systems last year for
$2.3 billion and could easily spend an additional $1 billion in 1996. GM
Hughes, with some $5 billion in buying power, could swallow the defense
portfolio of a TRW or a Rockwell International, each accounting for about
$3 billion in annual sales. But virtually every industry sector will
attract shoppers. In 1995, General Dynamics Corp. paid just $300 million
for Bath Iron Works Corp. and its $2 billion shipbuilding backlog.
   One megadeal, sources say, could combine Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. That would be a potent combination: McDonnell's $10.1 billion
in government sales with Boeing's 58% stake in the world commercial plane
market. It would solve each company's perennial weakness: Boeing covets
military orders, such as McDonnell's recent $18 billion award for C-17
transport planes. And McDonnell needs a commercial partner to counter
Europe's Airbus Industrie and a likely threat from upstart Asian
competitors. Neither company will comment publicly.
   While the big companies attract most of the attention, the
mergers-and-acquisitions market among smaller suppliers is likely to be no
less lively. ``The action is moving down the food chain,'' says Jon Kutler,
principal of the Los Angeles-based Quarterdeck Investments.
HIGH RESOLUTION. Unfortunately for thousands of aerospace and defense
workers, mergers will mean more layoffs. Even after cutting some 1.3
million jobs since the late 1980s, the industry will shrink its workforce
by an additional 30% over the next several years, says Robert D. Paulson, a
consultant with McKinsey & Co. Most of the layoffs will come as second-tier
players bail out or get bought. Two likely candidates: United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft and Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter unit.
   Conglomerates will take advantage of high defense prices to unload
businesses to move in new directions. Westinghouse Electric Corp., for
instance, announced in December that it will sell off its defense
businesses to help finance its recent $5.4 billion acquisition of CBS Inc.
   Entertainment and communications are fueling the defense industry's
greatest commercial success: After surpassing 1 million subscribers in its
first year of operation, Hughes' DirecTV unit has announced plans to expand
its satellite-TV service globally. And a consortium that includes Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon has invested more than $500 million to provide
high-resolution satellite images to real estate agents and farmers,
potentially a $2 billion-plus market.
   Such reassuring signs, together with the consolidation craze, have Wall
Street predicting another year of bulging profits. BT Securities' Demisch
expects defense and aerospace profits to rise at least 15% in 1996, to
about $5 billion. Downsizing is painful, but for those who hang on, the
rewards can be formidable.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Consolidation moves forward: Look for at least one more mega-merger
and continued capacity reduction.
   -- Modest growth in the Pentagon's procurement budget is likely, while
overseas sales could strengthen.

Negatives
   -- Profit margins will be squeezed as stingier contracts kick in. The
lucrative B-2 bomber and F-22 fighter programs may be stretched or killed.

`UNEXCITING MIGHT BE GOOD'
Few surprises in the oil patch. but with profits so healthy, who cares?

By:
By Gary McWilliams in Houston


The oil patch has made its peace with low prices. Relentless restructuring
and cost-cutting are delivering strong cash flow and higher profits despite
anemic pricing. Even in today's oil market, initial public offerings and
secondary stock sales are letting small independents fund new production
and property acquisitions without incurring debt.
   Executives are prepared for more of the same in 1996. ``We don't see
many things out there that look any different to us than 1995,'' says
Timothy C. Headington, chief executive of Headington Oil Co. in Dallas, a
small crude-oil producer that has been steadily expanding with cast-offs
from Exxon, Texaco, and others.
   Most important, there's little evidence that prices will take a spill.
Oil averaged $18.40 a barrel in 1995, and many forecasters expect it to
remain there. ``I see no reason for the 1996 numbers to change by more than
25 cents a barrel,'' insists Robert Gillon, senior analyst at market
watcher John S. Herold Inc. What little encouragement exists is in U.S.
natural-gas prices, which should recover to about $1.80 per thousand cubic
feet--up from $1.48 in 1995. That would put them back around 1994 levels.
STEADY AS SHE GOES. The major oil companies should see their earnings rise
a modest 6% in 1996, thanks to a healthy economy's thirst for more oil,
says Frederick P. Leuffer, senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. He
foresees demand growing next year by about 2%. While hardly as robust as
high tech, oils look like a safe haven. ``It's lackluster and sort of
unexciting right now,'' says Leuffer. ``But unexciting might be good'' were
the Dow to reverse course.
   There are a couple of iffy assumptions in this steady-as-she-goes
outlook. The biggest is that OPEC, which has suffered a steady loss of
world oil market share, continues to accept the losses. Some analysts are
concerned that OPEC countries may attempt to regain share by boosting their
production. Or that Iraq may return with significant new supplies. For now,
neither seems likely.
   Even if prices were to drop, restructuring and new technology have made
U.S. oil companies more able to cope. The best are finding fresh ways of
exploring and managing. A money-saving technique pioneered by Amoco Corp.
and Royal Dutch/Shell Group: pooling their assets in low-profit production
regions. The two are forming a joint company to merge West Texas and New
Mexico operations--and slash overlapping costs.
3-D IMAGING. Technology continues to lower costs, too (chart). Vastar
Resources Inc., a 1993 spin-off of Arco's U.S. oil and gas operations, says
its exploratory wells now hit pay dirt 60% of the time--as a result of
technologies such as three-dimensional seismic imaging--compared with only
47% of the time using older techniques. What's more, says CEO Michael E.
Wiley, ``I think there will be some creative ways [cost-cutting] can
continue.''
   With expenses falling, prices don't have to rise much for production
increases to flow straight to the bottom line. Next year's outlook is for a
solid 7% rise in crude-oil production--with even higher increases for
Texaco, Amoco, and Shell. Texaco, which hasn't boosted production for
nearly a decade, predicts a 40% production rise within five years, thanks
to rich prospects in the North Sea, Latin America, and China.
   While petrochemicals were the big contributor to last year's heady
profits at Phillips Petroleum Co. and Amoco, prices have softened--as
supply has caught up with demand. The question now: Will China, a huge
buyer that withdrew from the market in 1995, return in 1996? Bob Gower,
chief executive at chemical maker Lyondell Petrochemical Co., predicts
China's return could mean a second leg to the chemical boom. ``All the
information we have suggests we're not at the end of the cycle, but in a
transition period,'' he says.
   Retailing should continue to deliver profits, too. Continued reshuffling
of gasoline outlets--as companies concentrate on specific markets--has
turned the cyclical business into a reliable profit center. ``We're seeing
retail margins better than any time in history,'' says James E. Acridge,
CEO of Giant Industries Inc., a Scottsdale (Ariz.) refiner and
Southwest-area retailer. For years, stock analysts urged Giant to quit the
business. No longer. ``We're smart guys all of a sudden,'' he says. Stable
prices and lower costs are making a lot of people look smart these days.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Firmer gas pricing and savings from corporate restructurings should
produce stable profits.
   -- Advances in technology are lowering costs for exploration and
drilling.
   -- Gasoline retailing profit margins are at historic highs.

Negatives
   -- Petrochemical profits may soften further, cutting refining margins.
   -- OPEC could seek to recoup markets from non-OPEC suppliers.

A TIME TO REAP GLOBAL REWARDS
With demand and output growing, the U.S. could again dominate world
markets

By:
By Greg Burns in Chicago


Corn and soybean farmer Robert Mullins doesn't get excited too easily. But
from where he sits on an 1,800-acre spread in rural Shabbona, Ill., the
export outlook is cause for celebration: ``Spectacular,'' he says. ``It's
really coming alive.''
   The next year could bring an export bonanza for Mullins and other
farmers, as U.S. agriculture begins dominating world markets again. The
U.S. share of agricultural trade will rise to about 21% in 1996 after
falling as low as 16.7% in 1986. The value of U.S. exports will push up to
nearly $60 billion (chart), thanks to booming demand, reduced global trade
barriers, and a more competitive U.S. Farm Belt. U.S. farmers have long
considered exports the missing link in their pursuit of higher prices: ``If
Mother Nature cooperates, and we get a good crop, we could have the full
package for a change,'' says Mullins.
   In 1995, Mother Nature had other ideas. Heavy rains delayed spring
planting through much of the Midwest grain belt. Two months later, a summer
heat wave baked the earth rock hard. Then a killing frost in late September
put a chill on the autumn harvest. With the crop stunted and plagued by
disease, production of corn plunged from 10 billion bushels in 1994 to 7.3
billion in '95, sending U.S. corn stockpiles to 20-year lows. For the year,
corn futures prices had soared 51% as of Dec. 14, soybeans 31%, and wheat
25%. Big rewards went to farmers who produced decent crops in spite of the
weather, then held out for the best prices late in the year. But predicting
such explosive rallies can be tricky: ``With our reserves of feed grains at
historic lows, it makes the markets more volatile,'' says Patrick H. Arbor,
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.
SHRINKING SET-ASIDES. Still, the near-term trend is positive: Supplies have
tightened at a time of heavy demand, especially from Asia. Spending by the
Japanese, the largest importers of U.S. agricultural products, will reach
$11.3 billion in 1996, up from $10.5 billion in 1995, according to
projections from the U.S. Agriculture Dept. South Korea and China,
benefiting from robust economies, will increase imports as well. U.S. red
meat, fruit, and vegetables, along with grain, will be sought-after
commodities. ``We have tremendous export-market potential,'' says analyst
David C. Nelson of NatWest Securities Corp. in New York.
   U.S. farmers will be planting fence post to fence post this year. As of
mid-December, the government appeared to be all for it: Proposed reforms
would eliminate annual set-aside programs that support prices by idling
cropland. Instead of paying farmers not to farm, the government would
provide fixed payments, shrinking each year, based on how much they
received in the past. With this change, the amount of corn, wheat, and
soybean acreage in production should jump by about 10% in the coming
season, analysts estimate. As the reforms stood at the end of '95, they
would have little effect on cotton, rice, sugar, peanut, and dairy farmers,
who would retain key subsidies.
   The additional land for grain crops will be a modest plus for fertilizer
companies such as IMC Global, Freeport-McMoRan, and Potash. But the biggest
potential for those companies lies overseas. In China, for example, average
grain yields run about 50% behind those of the U.S. Yet rapid economic
growth has the huge Chinese population clamoring for a better diet. The
simplest way to boost yields: more fertilizer. The less developed world
will be pouring on the potash, says Wendell F. Bueche, chief executive
officer of IMC. ``There's nothing more dangerous than hungry people. You've
got to keep your population well-fed,'' he says.
   Other nations' efforts to improve farming techniques won't threaten U.S.
market share right away. Greater use of fertilizer, pesticide, and hybrid
seed, as well as increased mechanization, could level the playing field
someday. But the U.S. retains a big advantage in low-cost production. And
the demand is huge. China's consumption is projected to grow even faster
than its yields. And the former Soviet Union--a potentially huge
competitor--has seen its output crash along with the rest of its economy
over the past five years, with no comeback in sight.
   Even if the U.S. produces a bumper crop in 1996, many bins will remain
empty: ``We're not going to be flush with supply for at least several
growing seasons,'' predicts Daniel W. Basse of the AgResource consultancy
in Chicago. For the rest of this decade, the world will be depending on
U.S. farmers.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- With world grain supplies at record lows and a farm bill that
encourages greater production, U.S. farmers will plant fence post to fence
post.
   -- Export demand for agricultural products will soar.

Negatives
   -- With less government protection, farmers will be vulnerable to trade
problems.
   -- Uncertainty over the Farm Bill could complicate planting plans.

IT'S A GOOD YEAR TO GET HITCHED
'96 could be tough, so papermakers will continue to merge

By:
By Seanna Browder in Seattle


For a few crazy months early in 1995, making paper was akin to printing
money. As demand outran supply, prices for white paper took their most
dramatic leap since World War II. The jump of 38% per ton in Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.'s paper and paperboard composite index drove up profits an
estimated 180% for 1995 at the 19 largest wood and paper companies. As
paper executives tell it, the temptation to add new capacity was almost
unbearable. But remembering a binge that turned to bust earlier in the
decade, they resisted. ``The memories are still fresh of what it feels like
in a down cycle with too much capacity,'' says Lynn Michaelis, Weyerhaeuser
Co.'s director of marketing and economic research.
   Good thing. Fearing ever-higher prices, customers stockpiled paper. By
summer, the bloated inventories undermined the sky-high prices, and they
tumbled an average of 11%. Even without big new investments, the American
Forest & Paper Assn. expects production capacity for pulp and paper to rise
3% in 1996, largely because of efficiency improvements. And that may be
enough to push prices down, says Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Sherman Chao.
Chao predicts that prices of pulp and paper could decline as much as 19% in
1996 on steady volume. This spells lower profits, though nothing resembling
the industry's dive in the early '90s.
   Without any hope for booming demand, expect paper and pulp companies to
spend 1996 cleaning up balance sheets or plowing ahead with industry
consolidation. ``In our business, it is more favorable to buy assets than
build new plants,'' says John A. Georges, International Paper Co.'s chief
executive.
ELECTION YEAR. Acquisitions already are rolling. Kimberly-Clark Corp.
gobbled up Scott Paper Co. for $9.4 billion in December. Earlier in the
year, International Paper agreed to buy Federal Paper Board for $3.5
billion, and paid $1.15 billion for a controlling stake in Carter Holt
Harvey, New Zealand's largest timber-plantation owner. Boise Cascade sold
its Rainy River Forest Products unit to Canada's Stone-Consolidated and
acquired a 6.4% interest in Stone. In 1996, look for plenty more deals, as
the powerhouses buy slices of global markets and extend their reach over
raw materials.
   As the year begins, demand for white paper is lolling at 7% below
year-ago levels. Demand should recover smartly in 1996, especially in
coated papers used in glossy advertising, which should be bolstered by a
Presidential election and the Atlanta Olympics. ``The coated grades are
holding their own,'' says Paul C. Latta, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in
Seattle. Newsprint, though, which climbed 40% in price from 1994 to 1995,
could be headed for a fall. Inventories are at record levels, and high
prices are dampening demand.
   Recycling should continue to attract much of the growth in the pulp
industries. Minimills, which convert old cardboard into pulp, are
proliferating as such companies as Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade Corp.
expand. Recycled materials should jump 26% in 1996, while production of
marketwood pulp--the product of virgin wood chips--rises just 0.3%,
according to the American Forest & Paper Assn. The extra pulp will go into
producing more linerboard, kraft paper, and corrugated paper, creating a
plentiful supply of those products and damping their prices, says Larry
Katz of Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
HOUSEBOUND. The lumber industry, meanwhile, is struggling against competing
materials and a surge of imports. Canadian lumber now accounts for around
35% of the U.S. market, up from 28% in 1989. At the same time, growing
numbers of builders are substituting steel for wood, with steel-frame
housing growing from 500 to 80,000 houses in the past four years. And total
housing starts will rise only modestly in 1996, to around 1.4 million. All
that should spell a continued slump in lumber prices.
   Meanwhile, the wood industry will press ahead with such promising
engineered products as oriented strand board, a cheap new kind of
fiberboard. By 1998, there should be over 7 billion feet of oriented strand
board capacity, up from zero in 1988, estimates L. Pendleton Siegel, CEO of
Potlatch Corp., based in San Francisco. This should claim fully 50% of the
fiberboard capacity, prompting a brawl. ``There's going to be a bloody
market for the next two years,'' says Siegel. So don't be surprised to see
a few of the losers get gobbled up by the industry giants.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Demand for coated paper used in advertising should be bolstered by
the Presidential election and Olympic Games.
   -- Producers avoided bringing on fresh capacity when prices soared.

Negatives
   -- Mills making cheap, new engineered wood products will prompt a brawl
in the fiberboard market.
   -- The lumber industry faces intense competition from Canadian
producers.

THE WEB KEEPS SPREADING
The new market should grow 100% and create even greater opportunities

By:
By Neil Gross, with Amy Cortese, in New York


Netscape Navigator. Java. Yahoo. These pioneering products and services for
using the World Wide Web--and their creators--stole the headlines in 1995.
But Web software is still just a blip on the software radar screen. In
1996, Web-related programs--from browsers such as the Navigator to
``firewalls'' that protect corporate data--will be worth less than 1% of
the $100 billion-plus global software market, says Hambrecht & Quist Inc.
analyst J. Neil Weintraut (chart).
   What the numbers don't show, however, is the subterranean shock wave the
Web has sent across the software industry. Not only is the potential
huge--with annual growth of 100%, sales of Internet programs could hit $4
billion in 2000, Weintraut reckons--but the rush of millions of PC users
into cyberspace could change every aspect of the software business. The
race to cater to cybernauts has unleashed the biggest epidemic of startup
fever seen in years. And companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle are
now scrambling to make the Internet part of their core strategies.
   Once again, the software industry is exuberantly reinventing itself.
Indeed, the Internet revolution comes as growth in other software
categories is slowing. Sales of mainframe programs have been bumping along
at single-digit growth rates, and Anthony Picardi, a group vice-president
at International Data Corp., figures the $19.3 billion mainframe software
market will grow less than 2% over the next four years, to $19.6 billion in
1999.
READY TO JUMP. The huge market for personal computer office
``suites''--collections of programs that include spreadsheets, word
processing, and presentation graphics programs--is also reaching
saturation. But sales are poised for a 20% cyclical jump in 1996, as
millions of PC users upgrade to Windows 95, predicts Goldman, Sachs & Co.
analyst Rick G. Sherlund. The hottest market will remain software for
so-called client-server computing--which should grow at 40%, he figures.
   All told, says IDC's Picardi, the global market for packaged
software--about 75% of it made in America--will grow 10% in 1996, to $102
billion. The number would be bigger if not for mainframe software, which
makes up nearly 20% of worldwide sales. ``Other industries would die for a
similar growth rate,'' Picardi says.
   And what about the new ``Webware''? In 1995, businesses set up Web sites
like periscopes, to see what was going on. This year, as they toy with the
idea of electronic commerce across the Net, many companies will start using
internal Web sites as windows into their own networks--creating
``intranets.'' Says analyst Rich Edwards at Robertson, Stephens & Co. in
San Francisco: ``Every software company will have to participate.''
   No question, intranets are coming. Corporate computer managers
increasingly see Web pages as a means to inexpensively publish and share
information internally. This is very much what Lotus Development Corp. had
in mind with Notes, a ``groupware'' program that helps teams of employees
share documents or business applications simultaneously over a network. On
the Net, much of this can be done on shared Web ``pages''--for a fraction
of what it costs to buy, install, and customize Notes. Lotus, acquired by
IBM for $3 billion last summer, is furiously rejiggering Notes for the
Net.
   Meanwhile, Web software startups--including Netscape Communications
Corp.--can cash in. Companies such as Cambridge (Mass.)-based Vermeer
Technologies Inc. and OpenMarket Inc. should do a brisk business selling
software that helps companies build and maintain Web sites.
   The Web is also driving demand for new programming tools such as
object-oriented software languages. Versant Object Technology in Menlo
Park, Calif., ParcPlace-Digitalk in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Steven P. Jobs's
NeXT Computer are tailoring their programs--which let programmers build
software from reusable chunks of code--to run across the Internet. The
upshot: Sales of object-oriented programs should double from this year's
$300 million, according to IDC.
   This explosion of Web activity has forced most software giants to
rethink their game plans. Microsoft Corp. is building Internet links into
all of its software products, from office suites to operating systems, and
the software giant is licensing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming
language. IBM has also made the Internet a priority: Big Blue has created
an Internet software unit. Oracle is offering a family of Web programs,
including a ``browser'' and Web versions of its database software.
   One reason industry executives and analysts gush over cyberspace: It is
one of the few domains where Microsoft is not dominant. A quick look at the
packaged software market explains why that matters. Most of this year's
growth in office suites will go directly to Microsoft, which owns about 90%
of the $3 billion market. In addition, a large portion of multimedia
CD-ROMs sold this year will be Microsoft titles. Goldman's Sherlund figures
Microsoft's net will hit $2.2 billion in calendar 1996--up 20% over last
year--on sales of $8.7 billion, up 16%.
SOUPED UP. Another place where Microsoft has not been able to dominate is
client-server computing. In 1996, big corporations will continue to
downsize their computer operations from mainframes to networks of
servers--usually souped-up PCs or Unix workstations--and PC ``clients.'' In
the process, they'll pump billions of dollars into client-server databases
from Sybase, Informix, and industry leader Oracle, whose sales will jump
40% in 1996, to $4.9 billion, predicts Sherlund.
   Microsoft is far from discouraged in client-server software. A server
version of Windows NT is replacing Unix on many corporate networks and the
software giant expects strong sales in 1996 from its long-awaited
relational database upgrade, called SQL Server 6.0. It is expected to sell
for a fraction of the price of Oracle, Sybase, and Informix programs. And,
Microsoft plans to package SQL Server with other server programs, such as
systems management packages, and offer the bundles at steep discounts.
   Mainframe software vendors have also hopped on the client-server
bandwagon. Take Computer Associates International Inc. The Islandia (N.Y.)
software maker's revenue from client-server software grew 79% in the first
half of 1995 from a year earlier, while mainframe software sales--still 70%
of the company--grew just 18%.
   Continued corporate downsizing is another boon to software makers.
Having already stripped away layers of middle managers, many large
companies are trying to squeeze out further efficiencies. One way is to
junk disparate computer systems that run various operating units.
``Integrated enterprise software,'' supplied by the likes of SAP, Baan, and
Oracle, does the job (box). Another way to boost efficiency: automating
customer support. Newly public companies such as Vantive, Clarify, and
Remedy have software that creates electronic files, or ``cases,'' from each
customer query or complaint. Later, anyone in sales, marketing, or customer
support can call up the entire history of the transaction. Hambrecht &
Quist's Weintraut figures sales of such ``customer interaction systems,''
roughly $400 million in 1995, could grow to $3 billion by 2000.
   Merger mania swept through software in 1995 and is likely to continue in
1996. Computer Associates bought Legent, IBM bought Lotus and, in December,
SoftKey International Inc. pulled off a hostile deal to take over Learning
Co. On Dec. 20, Informix Corp. bid for Illustra Information Technologies.
But, with the Net spawning new startups every day, for every company that
gets merged out of existence, two new ones are bound to appear.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Windows 95 will spark demand for educational, entertainment, and
business software.
   -- Businesses are rushing onto the Web, spawning markets such as digital
commerce.

Negatives
   -- Diversity in desktop software will shrink as Microsoft's clout grows
and Apple's shrinks.
   -- Heavy discounting of software suites--and growing development
costs--will make life harder for small players.

YOUR DATA SHOULD MEET MY DATA

By:
By Neil Gross in New York, with Gail Edmondson in Paris

Hark back to the old days in the computer industry--about two years ago. A
salesperson at Digital Equipment Corp. could drill down in a company
database to fish out technical specs for a customer. But the data produced
might not match what a Digital inventory manager kept separately on her
desktop computer, resulting in annoying delays while users cross-checked
their information.
   That's why Digital and dozens of other companies are hot on so-called
``integrated enterprise software.'' The idea is to junk all the old
``legacy'' systems that separately handle a large company's customer
orders, inventory, shipping, and logistical information, and replace them
with a single set of programs to run the company. That way, all the data
look the same, regardless of who's tapping in or where they work.
   Large multinationals already have installed billions of dollars' worth
of these systems. This has flooded the coffers of industry leaders SAP in
Germany and Baan in Holland. Americans missed the first wave, but now
Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp., and others are plunging in. The sector is
poised to grow 14% worldwide, to $11.1 billion in 1996, according to
International Data Corp.
   The market for related services is a gold mine, too. Deloitte & Touche's
consulting arm rakes in $200 million a year advising SAP customers. It's
``a phenomenal success,'' says Darvis Cormier, a D&T international
director.
   Such services don't come cheap: A switchover can cost a large
manufacturer $100 million, making it ``the most expensive systems decision
a company has ever made,'' says Dick J. Fishburn, chief information officer
of Digital, which is installing SAP software.
    And if your company buys such a system, your integration problems
aren't instantly solved, warns Vinnie Mirchandani, an analyst with Gartner
Group, based in Stamford, Conn. He calls enterprise systems ``a 40%
solution masquerading as a 100% solution.'' Still, a 40% solution is better
than none. And that should put plenty of wind underneath the wings of
software and services companies in this hot niche.

THIS YEAR, SERVERS WILL BE KING
PCs are everywhere. Now the spotlight is on machines that can link them

By:
By John W. Verity in New York


For more than a decade now, the computer industry has been driven by a
vision of giving everyone his or her own computer. Large organizations have
rushed to put a PC onto every desktop and stopped expanding their budgets
for mainframes. Engineers switched in droves from sharing minicomputers to
running their own workstations. Families have scooped up millions of PCs,
too, for use in home offices and to entertain the kids.
   Now, with personal computers seemingly everywhere, the spotlight is
shifting back to larger computers--the kind that can do work for many
different people at once. Collectively known as network servers--everything
from souped-up PCs selling for $10,000 to mainframes and
supercomputer-class systems costing millions--big iron will be in for the
most technical change and competitive action during 1996 and the following
few years. ``Servers are regaining their place as the fulcrum of business
computing,'' says Gregory Garry, analyst at Dataquest Inc. ``They're the
centerpiece of the network.''
   Servers also remain the sweet spot of the computer market, offering
gross margins of 30% to 50%, vs. the 15% or less seen in PCs. ``Servers are
clearly the healthiest segment of the computer industry,'' says Laura
Conigliaro, computer analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. In corporations,
small servers store files and move E-mail for departments. Giant servers
can act as data warehouses--massive libraries of detailed product, sales,
and financial information gathered from across an organization's many other
computers. The World Wide Web, with close to 100,000 servers in place and
hundreds more being attached every week, is also a major contributor to
server demand.
PRICE-CUTTING. All told, International Data Corp. (IDC) estimates that
shipments of servers based on PCs--machines using Intel chips or souped-up
versions of Apple's Macintosh--will grow 35%, to 1.05 million units, from
777,000 in 1995. Shipments of servers based on proprietary hardware
designs, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sun Microsystems
Inc., will increase about 15% in 1996.
   At the same time, PC sales will remain strong. Dataquest estimates that
U.S. consumption of PCs in 1996 will hit 25.6 million units, up 16% from
1995 (chart). Worldwide consumption will grow by 19%, to 68.7 million
units. Price-cutting will stunt growth in dollar terms: IDC reckons total
U.S. spending on PCs will be up only 12.6% over 1995.
   The news in other categories is mixed. Workstation shipments are
projected to grow from 847,000 units in 1995 to 982,500 units in 1996.
Sales of IBM-compatible mainframes will fall, from $7.5 billion in 1995 to
$7.1 billion in 1996, as a line of cheaper machines based on
microprocessors grows more popular.
THE PREFAB FOUR. Although booming, the server market may be in for some
jarring changes in 1996, thanks to Intel Corp. Along with its new
top-of-the-line P6, or Pentium Pro, microprocessor, Intel has launched a
complete circuit board containing four P6 chips. This Quad P6 board is
designed specifically as a building block for low-cost servers. Like the
prefabricated motherboards from Intel that helped relatively small Packard
Bell and Gateway 2000 beat IBM and Compaq to market with the first
Pentium-based PCs, the Quad P6 board could put lots of new players into the
server business overnight and change the market's economics. Bottom line:
Margins will begin to resemble those of the cookie-cutter desktop-PC
market.
   Intel's Quad P6 won't just affect the low end of the server business.
Companies such as Sequent Computer, Chen Systems, and Data General plan to
gang as many as a dozen of the boards together to produce systems that can
outperform traditional mainframe computers for a fraction of the cost.
PaineWebber Inc. computer analyst Stephen K. Smith figures that P6-based
servers will sell for less than half the price of proprietary servers at
the same performance level. It's ``one of the most significant hardware
developments to impact the computer industry since Compaq cloned the IBM
PC,'' he says.
   Luckily for HP, Sun, and other companies making non-Intel-based servers,
Quad P6-based machines won't start shipping in volume until late 1996, and
there will be a lag before software can be readied to take advantage of
them. But the warning shots have been fired for another major battle in an
industry that seems to thrive on turmoil.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- As computers get cheaper, they will become even more central to the
economy.
   -- Electronic commerce is fueling demand for high-capacity Web servers.

Negatives
   -- Standardized parts and designs will gnawat the profitability of
midrange and large computers.
   -- Personal-computer makers will feel more pressure from Intel's gradual
entry into PC manufacturing.

SILICON GOES FROM PEAK TO PEAK
In a boom that could last a decade, turning out enough chips is the big
problem

By:
By Robert D. Hof in San Francisco and Otis Port in New York


For the companies that plant those teensy transistors on the silicon chips
from which personal computers and other electronic gadgets sprout, 1996
shapes up as the fourth consecutive year of 20%-plus growth--26%, according
to the Semiconductor Industry Assn. That's remarkable. Chipmaking has long
gyrated through boom-and-bust cycles every three years or so. And while
growth in 1996 won't match 1995's spectacular 40% sales jump, analysts
still look for chipmakers to post per-share earnings gains averaging 29%.
   The outlook is for steady growth until 2000, and perhaps beyond.
``There's going to be a black hole for computing power for at least a
decade,'' says Gordon A. Campbell, chairman of startup 3Dfx Interactive
Inc., which makes chips that accelerate onscreen graphics for multimedia
PCs. The optimism isn't limited to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Vladi
Catto, chief economist at Texas Instruments Inc., says the industry might
expand by 20% a year for the next two decades. By comparison, since TI made
the world's first microchip 36 years ago, the industry has averaged 15%
annual gains.
OFF THE ROLLER COASTER? To be sure, not every sector is booming. The growth
rate for multimedia PCs seems to be slowing, for example. No matter. Most
chipmakers won't be able to satisfy demand anyhow unless the whole PC
business falters. ``The rate at which semiconductors are going into [a
widening profusion of products] has just skyrocketed,'' says G. Dan
Hutcheson, president of chip watcher VLSI Research Inc. This ever-expanding
base of customers means producers are becoming less vulnerable to a hiccup
in any one market, adds Jean-Philippe Dauvin, chief economist at European
chipmaker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. That's a key reason why the
industry believes its roller-coaster cycles are a thing of the past. While
chipmakers can't escape broad economic swings, these ups and downs will be
a merry-go-round ride by comparison.
   Because PCs remain the main engine boosting silicon's rocket for now,
the immediate beneficiaries will be the makers of dynamic random-access
memory (DRAM) chips and, of course, Intel Corp. New PCs gobble two to four
times as much memory as older models, so DRAM shipments could soar 40% this
year. As for Intel, look for the microprocessor king to sell 25% more
``brain'' chips this year than in 1995.
   Despite fatter sales, Intel cautions that its incredible 55% gross
margins could shrink, because of its rapidly growing business in PC
motherboards and plug-in boards. On the other hand, some analysts say
Intel's profits could actually improve. Its chip sales are shifting
dramatically from 486 microprocessors to higher-priced Pentium models
(chart), and Intel may pare prices less aggressively. That's because
up-and-coming microprocessor rivals such as Cyrix and NexGen--soon to
become a division of Advanced Micro Devices--aren't cranking out enough
chips to cramp Intel's style. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. recently said its
fourth-quarter profits would fall short because it isn't grabbing as much
486 business from Intel as it hoped.
   NexGen Inc. and Cyrix Corp. are hardly the only companies facing a
capacity squeeze. In fact, lack of capacity will rob the chip industry of
several percentage points of potential growth this year. ``Everybody's
straining just to get enough fabs out,'' says Ray Stata, chairman of Analog
Devices Inc. ``Fab'' is chip-speak for wafer-fabrication plant, the
squeaky-clean factories that make semiconductors.
   Scarce capacity means continuing pain for the fabless companies that
often design the industry's leapfrog chips. To guarantee production of
their next wonder circuits, several fabless companies are buying into chip
producers. Cirrus Logic Inc., the biggest fabless company, plans to spend
$2 billion over the next five years. Part of the money will go for a 15%
stake in United Silicon, a new chip factory in Taiwan.
   Wafer fabs now cost as much as $1.3 billion each, and the industry will
need to pour the foundation for a new one every week, figures TI's Catto,
if chips are to reach the $331 billion level predicted for 2000 by market
researcher Dataquest Inc. However, until investors share the industry's
newfound confidence that chips have outgrown their boom-and-bust days, the
stock market could gum up Dataquest's long-range timetable. Absent that,
the silicon horizon has a bright golden glow.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- PCs continue to boom, driving sales of memory chips and Intel's
Pentium microprocessors.
   -- Use of chips in a growing variety of products will smooth the
traditional boom-and-bust cycles.

Negatives
   -- Capacity shortages could hurt producers of memory chips and
chipmakers that contract out.
   -- Investor jitters about possible market slowdowns could sink stocks
and limit chipmakers' investing in new plants.

THE NOT-SO-CALM BEFORE THE STORM
All hell will break loose when deregulation hits. For now, business is
strong

By:
By Catherine Arnst in New York


The telecommunications industry is setting off on a great adventure in
1996: The forces of competition are being unleashed in all parts of the
business for the first time. However, most of the year will be a
profit-boosting calm before the storm--``the last good year before
competition starts in earnest,'' says Simon W. Flannery, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. ``The cable companies rolling out telephones, the
Bells getting into cable, PCS [wireless] systems being switched on--all the
things we're just guessing at at the moment will start coming into focus in
'96.''
   Congress had tried for two decades to pass legislation that would
overhaul the 1934 rules regulating telecommunications. Finally, at the tail
end of 1995, Congress was able to write a sweeping telecom-deregulation
bill that allows long-distance carriers, local phone companies, and
cable-TV operators to enter one another's markets. And even without
Congress, about half the states are freeing up local phone markets. By next
January, competition should be busting out all over.
   The telecom legislation allows long-distance and cable-TV operators into
the local phone market immediately. Local monopolies can offer long
distance and cable TV outside their regions at once, and in-region as soon
as competition is established. If there are no hitches, Bell Atlantic Corp.
Vice-Chairman James G. Cullen predicts that consumers in some parts of the
country will be able to choose a local phone company by the end of 1996.
GRAB A PARTNER. As all the industry's players scramble to ready themselves
for this brave new world, expect to see a flurry of alliances,
partnerships, and outright acquisitions. Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex
Corp., which have teamed up in three wireless and entertainment
partnerships already, are likely to offer long- distance together as well.
Analysts say other such pairings are probable. And look for buyouts of
small long-distance and alternative-access companies such as WorldCom and
MFS Communications.
   In the meantime, business is booming. Demand for Internet access, the
growth of telecommuting, the huge popularity of cellular phones, and a
surge in data transmission all make telephony a growth business.
Long-distance calling traffic accelerated by 8% in 1995 and is expected to
grow another 8% this year. Local phone companies should add access lines at
a rate of 3% this year, compared with 1% to 2% earlier in the decade.
   The result: Phone companies are bringing in money like never before.
Steven R. Yanis of Oppenheimer & Co. expects revenues for the three biggest
long-distance carriers--AT&T, MCI Communications, and Sprint--to grow by
8.2% in 1996, to $118 billion, while the seven Baby Bells should see 3.2%
growth in revenues, to $96 billion.
   Once competition starts, price wars will break out and margins will be
under pressure. Plus, the phone companies have to start getting ready for
competition now, an expensive task. Market researcher Forrester Research
Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that the top local and long-distance
carriers will need to spend $30 billion over the next three years to
bankroll their competitive strategies. J.P. Morgan estimates that capital
spending is expected to increase to $130 per phone line, from $120 per line
in 1995.
   The local phone monopolies in particular must develop a competitive
mindset. ``They really need to get much more focused on customer service,''
says Larry R. Levitan, managing partner for Andersen Consulting's
communications group. For proof, just look at a new study from Deloitte &
Touche: Nearly 40% of corporate telecom managers say they would be likely
to switch from their traditional local-service provider if given a choice
of comparable quality. That's why industry analysts think phone companies
with large rural territories and few corporate customers, such as SBC
Communications Inc. and U S West Inc., are best positioned for the
deregulated world, since they are the least likely to face competition.
   With the Bells freed to enter new markets such as long distance and
cable, deregulation should be a ``win-win'' for everyone in the long run,
says Yanis. ``I truly believe that competition will increase the size of
the whole market. This will not be a zero-sum game. It's a positive-sum
game.'' And the starting gun is about to go off.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Deregulation will unleash a wave of investment and creativity.
   -- Demand is booming. Long-distance usage keeps rising, and households
are adding second lines in record numbers.

Negatives
   -- While deregulation is in sight, state and federal agencies must work
out hundreds of details first.
   -- Carriers will have to spend billions of dollars to get into one
another's markets.

ROBUST AND READY TO BRAWL
Drugmakers are flush, so more mergers--even hostile ones--may be on the
horizon

By:
By Joseph Weber in Philadelphia


With stock prices setting records and earnings climbing at double-digit
rates again, pharmaceutical executives are heading for maybe their best
year since the roaring '80s. More unit sales, more freedom to raise prices,
and savings from restructurings are hypercharging growth. ``We're not in
the doldrums of the early '90s anymore,'' says Robert L. Andrews, a
Deloitte & Touche managing director.
   Heavy margin pressure, sharp staff cuts, and deep discounting are fading
as fast as memories of President Clinton's election-year attacks on
drugmaker price-gouging. For 10 leading U.S. and European drugmakers, net
income this year may rise as much as 12%, to $18.6 billion, while sales
climb 8%, to $106.2 billion, estimates Cowen & Co. analyst Stephen Scala.
The healthiest companies could repeat 1995's 20% earnings gains.
   Yet execs can't afford to be complacent. Mergers have reshaped the
industry, and more may be on the way. The biggest companies gain an edge in
funding research and development, bargaining with managed-care buyers, and
competing globally. By mid-December, the industry had tallied $41.2 billion
in deals, up from 1994's record $36.1 billion, according to Windhover's
directory, 1995 Health Care Strategist.
TWISTED ARMS. Foreign buyers set the pace in 1995, led by Glaxo Holdings'
record-breaking $14 billion purchase of Burroughs Wellcome, Hoechst's $7.1
billion acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow, and the stock-for-stock merger
of Upjohn and Pharmacia, valued at $7 billion. Hostile deals, such as
Johnson & Johnson's $1.8 billion takeover of Cordis, a maker of cardiology
devices, could bring an unwilling partner or two to the altar this year.
Says Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. analyst Neil B. Sweig: ``The white
gloves are off.''
   Who's next? Industry titans Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.
figure prominently in Wall Street speculation as potential acquirers of the
midsize likes of Monsanto Co.'s Searle & Co. unit or perennial merger
target Warner-Lambert Co. Well-heeled Swiss drugmakers Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and
Sandoz Ltd. also make likely buyer lists. Japanese drugmakers, whose
stockholders are wrestling with tough times generally, could be alluring to
global buyers.
   Acquisitions aren't always the right tonic. Merck, SmithKline Beecham,
and Lilly are still chasing a payoff from pharmacy-benefit managers, the
distribution operations for which they together have paid $13 billion since
1993. At the same time, Rite Aid Corp. and other drugstore chains are
building competing units. After shelling out $6.6 billion in 1993 for Medco
Containment Services Inc., a big benefit manager, Merck & Co. has turned
cool toward all kinds of mergers. Says CEO Raymond V. Gilmartin: ``Major
acquisitions would be a diversion for us.''
STICKER SHOCK. Acquisition fever may be tempered, too, by slightly more
pricing freedom. ``Companies are less inclined to give discounts and reduce
prices,'' says Wayne P. Yetter, chief executive of Astra Merck Inc. Indeed,
some prices--chiefly to retail drugstore buyers not covered by insurance
plans--have been climbing faster than inflation.
   The industry's financial health conceals a shortfall of novel
blockbusters. While drugmakers squeeze ever more sales out of big producers
such as cholesterol-fighters and antidepressants, few have offered truly
new potential $1 billion sellers recently. One likely exception: the
osteoporosis treatment Fosamax, a drug from Italy's Istituto Gentili being
marketed by Merck in the U.S. Another potential big winner is J&J's
Risperdal, a schizophrenia treatment.
   Drugmakers aren't helping their cause by limiting R&D. The
Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America says the 8% growth in
industry R&D spending in 1995 was the lowest in more than two decades. ``I
worry that by reducing the rate of increase in research, we are going to
reduce the opportunities'' for new drugs, says Schering-Plough CEO Richard
J. Kogan. He says his company will outpace its peers in 1996, boosting its
$650 million in R&D spending by more than 10%.
   R&D cannot be neglected. Pfizer Inc. credits new drugs for boosting its
net income an estimated 20% last year, to about $1.6 billion, on a 23% rise
in sales, to $10.2 billion. This year, analysts expect Pfizer to nearly
match that growth. Luckily for Pfizer's competitors, this won't be the year
they'll have to pay for underinvestment. There's enough right with the drug
business that there will be plenty of gains to go around.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- More providers are using medicine instead of surgery or
psychotherapy.
   -- Pressure against price hikes is easing, helping broaden profit
margins.
   -- Wider uses are being found for big sellers such as
cholesterol-reducers.

Negatives
   -- With few new blockbusters, drugmakers will battle to sell more of
what's already in the medicine cabinet.
   -- Merging companies are jeopardizing their futures by cutting R&D.

THE MEDIA CIRCUS IS STILL IN TOWN
Thrills and chills as global demand keeps the buying frenzy going

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles


It has been more than a decade since television host Monty Hall looked
behind that curtain for the last time. But in the frenzied media world,
every day seems to be a rerun of Let's Make a Deal. Walt Disney Co. plunked
down $19 billion in stock and cash to buy Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
Westinghouse Electric Corp. bought CBS Inc. News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch jumped on the Internet, launched a sports channel to rival ESPN,
and then made plans to beam TV signals to Latin America. And in cable? Last
year, a staggering $25 billion in deals were struck, as nearly one in five
subscribers saw their cable companies change hands.
   In 1996, the media dealmaking won't be confined to the TV and movie
businesses. USA Today publisher Gannett Co. is still on the prowl after
completing its $1.7 billion purchase of Multimedia Inc. Other publishing
deals may be in the offing. Spurring on the activity is an unquenchable
worldwide thirst for American-made movies and TV programs--and a surprising
rebound in Americans' appetite for the printed word.
   Programming and distribution entities will keep getting married in
1996--programmers to ensure an outlet for their works, distributors to fill
their pipelines. General Electric Co. is likely to go shopping for partners
again this year, after failing in 1995 to persuade Disney to buy a
half-interest in its NBC Inc. unit. Possible candidates: Seagram's MCA
subsidiary, which includes Universal Pictures, or Sony's Hollywood-based
studios. Microsoft Corp., a partner with NBC in an on-line news channel,
could also be a bidder. After buying CBS, Westinghouse is still looking to
bolster its programming and could strike an alliance with a Hollywood
studio as well. ``The idea is to protect yourself from being shut out as
the big get bigger,'' says Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Jessica Reif.
NET GAINS. Propelling the movement toward bigness in 1996 is the expected
passage of the long-awaited federal telecommunications bill. Among other
things, the legislation would immediately allow cable and telephone
companies to compete in one another's markets and gradually raise ceilings
on the number of radio and TV stations a company can own. That should
prompt a new wave of acquisitions, says Gene F. Jankowski, managing
director at Veronis, Suhler & Associates Inc., a New York investment bank.
Among those rumored ready to sell is billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, whose
New World Entertainment Inc. broadcast and production company is loaded
with debt.
   Media companies will benefit in 1996 from a robust advertising market
that for the third year running should outperform the overall economy.
Boosted by the Olympic Games in Atlanta and U.S. political campaigns,
domestic advertising in all media should grow by 7.8%, to $174 billion,
predicts Robert J. Coen, a senior vice-president at ad agency
McCann-Erickson Worldwide. The four major broadcast networks will be among
the biggest winners, with a projected 12.5% increase, to $13 billion.
NEW SYSTEMS. The ad increase isn't the only good news for network
television. After losing audiences to cable and syndicated programming for
years, the number of sets tuned into the networks will stabilize in 1996 at
roughly 64% of those viewing TV, predicts Veronis Suhler. But not every
network will survive. Time Warner Inc.'s struggling Warner Bros. network
will likely seek a merger with startup UPN, a joint venture of United
Broadcasting and Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp.
   Cable television, meanwhile, will seek growth by adding services rather
than subscribers. After adding 9 million subscribers over the previous five
years, the industry's customer base will grow by roughly 1 million in 1996,
according to Veronis Suhler. To maintain the cash-flow growth, cable
companies will need to build systems to battle the telcos, and many cable
companies will introduce modem services for high-speed data transfer later
in 1996. Other companies, such as Tele-Communications Inc., will move
aggressively overseas into markets with greater potential to add
subscribers.
   Foreign companies--which have sat on the sidelines since the disastrous
foray of Japanese companies in Hollywood--will also reemerge on the
American media scene. The sale of Tur-ner Broadcasting System Inc. to Time
Warner alerted many of them to the dwindling number of companies available
to fill the Information Superhighway with films and TV shows. Dutch
electronics giant Philips' PolyGram entertainment unit will aggressively
seek an acquisition. So might German media powerhouse Bertelsmann, which
recently opened a flashy Los Angeles headquarters. One likely target is
MGM/UA, which is rising from the ashes with such films as GoldenEye and Get
Shorty. The studio's owner, French bank Credit Lyonnais, recently hired
investment bankers Lazard Freres & Co. to sell off the studio.
PAPER PROFITS. Other bidding wars will feature Sony Corp.'s Los Angeles
film unit and Thorn EMI's record division. Murdoch is a possible bidder for
EMI. So is Disney, which has a small record company with few stars. The
biggest bidding war, however, could center on Sony. After parting ways with
U.S. CEO Michael P. Schulhof, Sony is likely to try unloading a piece of
its film company. Sony insiders say Murdoch has expressed interest.
Investment bankers say GE is eager to line up more content for
broadcasting. And, despite his frequent denials, Microsoft Chairman William
H. Gates III may also be interested.
   Hollywood production will increase in 1996 to satisfy the booming
foreign market and domestic cable operators. The year will feature more
than the usual numbers of retreaded oldies. Universal Pictures, with fresh
capital from new owner Seagram, will churn out films based on old TV shows
McHale's Navy, Flipper, and Sergeant Bilko. Tom Cruise will headline a film
version of Mission: Impossible from Viacom's Paramount Pictures unit.
   The newspaper business lacks Hollywood's glitz but had a marquee year in
1995, with earnings gains of 14.8% at 11 big newspaper publishing
companies, according to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) Securities Corp.
McCann-Erickson's Coen says that in 1996, advertising revenue will increase
by a modest 5.5%, to $4.25 billion, down from an 11% rise through the first
nine months of 1995. That will dampen industry earnings growth to an
average of 6.5% in 1996, DLJ says.
   Those kinds of returns don't satisfy many newspaper publishers, who say
they need to make drastic cost reductions to ensure their long-term health.
``We're starting to see a little breathing room, but not an awful lot,''
says Mark H. Willes, Times Mirror Co.'s new CEO. In 1995, Willes cut
hundreds of jobs at the flagship Los Angeles Times and closed the New York
City edition of Long Island-based Newsday.
   Still, newspaper companies are hardly turning their backs on their
printing presses--high paper prices and the Info Highway notwithstanding.
Evidence of that is Gannett's purchase of Multimedia. Also, in 1996, The
New York Times will launch a Northeastern edition, while the Los Angeles
Times will revive plans to distribute its paper in Washington, D.C.
   Why the newfound optimism? For one thing, readership of newspapers is up
as the number of Americans 35 and over expands. Those demographics will
also help book and magazine publishers. In 1996, a slew of new specialty
magazines will likely hit the newsstands. Century 21 Real Estate Corp., for
instance, will launch a new home magazine with Hachette Filipacchi
Magazines Inc. Book publishers intend to expand their lines to fill the
shelves of book superstores and discount chains. Hearst Corp. will soon
launch its first hardcover line for adults. Even MTV will have its own book
line, geared to the under-35 crowd.
   Which media companies will strike the audience's fancy in 1996? That's
hard to say. But these days, if you can't produce a hit you can always buy
the hitmaker.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The Olympics, the election, and a revived economy should increase TV
ad revenue by about 8%.
   -- Telecom deregulation will spur a burst of investment by phone
companies in cable TV.
   -- Foreign demand for U.S. entertainment remains strong.

Negatives
   -- Technology disappointments will slow adoption of interactive TV.
   -- Smaller players may be shunted aside.

THE BABY BELLS TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS IN TINSELTOWN

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles

As he stood before his shareholders at Ameritech Corp.'s annual meeting,
chatting via a video hookup with Mickey Mouse, Chief Executive Richard C.
Notebaert left little doubt that the telephone companies' pin-striped world
had definitely gone Hollywood. In 1996, in a wide swath of head-to-head
confrontations from San Diego to Chicago, the Baby Bells intend finally to
launch their attack on the cable-television industry.
   The sweeping telecommunications bill in Congress would allow phone
companies to challenge cable operators outside their home markets
immediately, and within their regions once they prove their phone business
faces competition. At first, phone-company offerings won't look all that
different from what TV viewers get now by handing over $40 to $50 each
month to their local cable companies. Down the road, however, the phone
companies hope to beat the cable companies to the interactive market with
such features as home shopping and games. ``The idea is to outdo the cable
companies, not just match them,'' says Howard Stringer, chairman of the
Tele-TV venture that includes three of the seven Baby Bells.
   First off, the telcos plan to offer more channels. In Glendale Heights,
Ill., Ameritech's network of optical fiber and copper cable will offer 90
channels, compared with the local cable operator's current 60. In
Riverside, Calif., where the 90 channels will be delivered over the air
through a system called wireless cable, the reception is expected to be
sharper. With only 15% of Riverside County receiving cable, Pacific Telesis
Group expects to make inroads by stuffing marketing literature into the
weekly phone bills it sends in the area.
   The telcos won't lack programming firepower, either. Walt Disney Co., a
partner with three of the Baby Bells and GTE Corp. in another joint
venture, has assigned top animators to work on tailor-made programming,
including a souped-up on-screen guide. As for Tele-TV, Stringer says it has
a production facility ready for action. For phone companies, Hollywood will
be quite a change from selling call-waiting service.

THE PATIENT IS STABLE-FOR NOW
Health-care costs are in check, but the industry's upheaval isn't over

By:
By Keith H. Hammonds in New York


A deceptive peace has descended on the nation's $750 billion health-care
industry. There has been no word of a major health-maintenance organization
merger for months. Hospital giant Columbia/HCA appears too occupied
digesting the acquisitions of years past to indulge its unrelenting
appetite. And once again, reform sits deadlocked on Capitol Hill.
   But just wait: Beneath the surface, a revolution rages on. ``The pace of
change is stunning,'' says Dr. W. Allen Schaffer, head of managed care at
CIGNA Healthcare Inc. ``We have to reevaluate our strategic assumptions
every six months.'' Managed-care plans snatched some 5 million Americans
from their traditional health insurers in 1995, bringing total enrollment
in HMOs to 56 million. Those are powerful numbers, and managed care now
calls the shots. This year, it likely will force more consolidation than
ever.
   The industry, still fragmented and unwieldy, remains eminently ripe for
restructuring. Even though health-care inflation has slowed, spending
continues to edge upward as a share of the nation's economy (chart).
Massive overhead associated with excess capacity remains, and ``the only
way to slow growth in health-care spending is to debloat the system,'' says
John F. Hindelong, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp.
   That process is under way. Indeed, employers saw their health-care costs
drop in 1994 and remain flat in 1995 as millions of workers moved into
cheaper managed-care plans. Employers' costs will probably rise slightly on
average in 1996 as fewer additional employees switch to managed care,
according to Foster & Higgins consultant John Erb.
TEAMING UP. The cost squeeze means more upheaval for doctors and hospitals.
``The market works, but it is very painful,'' says Robert L. Montgomery,
chief executive at Alta Bates Health System in Berkeley, Calif. Alta Bates,
forced to hold managed-care charges flat for a third straight year, has
joined a hospital consortium to amass a total of 600,000 managed-care
patients--the better to negotiate with ever-larger HMOs. Even big,
for-profit chains are looking at admissions increases of only 1% to 3% in
1996, says DLJ's Hindelong, though consolidation will help the sector lift
earnings by 15% to 20% next year.
   The motivation is irresistible: As of Dec. 15, 1995, the industry had
seen a record 433 mergers and acquisitions, according to Securities Data
Co. Increasingly, those mergers are crossing industry boundaries--producing
new ``integrated delivery systems'' that put hospitals, doctors, nursing
homes, and others under the same corporate roof. The object: one-stop
shopping for managed-care companies, who require access to a broad array of
services, says Coopers & Lybrand consultant Glenn A. Shively.
CRAWLING REFORM. At the same time, HMOs are themselves driving for size,
market penetration, and efficiency. Growth certainly won't come from rate
hikes: Even the better HMOs will win premium increases of just 1% to 2%
this year, says analyst Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Rather, the HMOs need new bodies. Many will see big revenue gains this year
as more Medicare recipients move into managed-care plans--a shift that
would accelerate if health-care reform succeeds.
   And what of reform? Republicans and Democrats alike want to cut back on
payments to Medicare service providers. And doctors and hospitals face an
enormous hit from a proposed provision requiring payment reductions if
total Medicare spending exceeds budget. The outlook for Medicaid is
particularly cloudy--one reason many insurers are staying away from the
business.
   In any case, governmental change will prove, as always, far less
powerful than the market-driven charge for critical mass and market muscle.
The resulting shakeout will be dramatic. Industry executives suspect that
Aetna Life & Casualty and CIGNA, both on the verge of shedding hunks of
their property-and-casualty businesses, could spend huge sums to turn their
middling health businesses into national HMOs.
   Such new players, if well-conceived and adequately funded, could
transform a compartmentalized industry that until now has fought its
battles largely within cities or regions. ``By the end of the decade, we
will begin to see the endgame appear,'' says Gennaro J. Vasile, a longtime
hospital executive who recently became head of Gemini Consulting Inc.'s
North American health-care practice. And some fair hints should come even
sooner.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- For-profit hospitals should continue to gain market share and see
admissions rise modestly.
   -- Well-managed nursing homes will pick up business as hospital stays
continue to shrink.

Negatives
   -- Rising cost pressure from managed care, plus lower Medicare and
Medicaid rates, will keep a squeeze on margins.
   -- Health-care reform hasn't addressed the uninsured, who will put an
even greater strain on the system.

PICKING UP SPEED
Airlines are finally in the clear--and railroads may link up

By:
By Wendy Zellner in Dallas


Transportation services expect modest growth in 1996, with airlines and
railroads faring best and truckers bringing up the rear. All three sectors
are focusing on improving productivity--and keeping a close eye on the
merger scene.
   Airline executives are happiest: After five years of losses and
retrenchment, the industry has finally recovered. Net profits in 1995
totaled about $2 billion, vs. a $279 million loss in 1994. In a sentiment
widely echoed by his peers, Continental Airlines Chief Executive Gordon M.
Bethune says: ``It's a pretty rosy-looking '96.''
   With traffic expected to grow only about 3% in 1996, airline profits
will hinge on keeping costs in check and capacity usage up. That won't be
easy. Unit costs will rise 1.5% to 2% for the major carriers, after holding
steady in 1995, says analyst Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber Inc. ``We've
picked the low-hanging fruit,'' agrees Delta Air Lines Inc. CEO Ronald W.
Allen. ``It's going to get tougher from here on out.''
   The good news for airlines is that capacity should grow more slowly than
traffic, meaning fuller planes and higher fares. Systemwide capacity for
U.S. airlines grew about 2.5% last year, and it's likely to show a similar
increase in '96, estimates David A. Swierenga, chief economist for the Air
Transport Assn. That bodes well for fares. True, the rapid expansion of
such low-cost carriers as Southwest Airlines Co. and ValuJet Airlines Inc.
will help to hold fares down. But Edward P. Gilligan, executive
vice-president for American Express Co.'s Travel Management Services,
predicts that airfares will rise an average of 3% to 4% this year, with
only limited and carefully targeted discounting.
BOLD COMBINATIONS. The airlines' discipline is expected to translate into
higher profits. A bullish Steve Lewins of Gruntal & Co. figures major
airlines' earnings will soar 56% from 1995's modest level. The rising
profits complicate carriers' efforts to wrest major concessions from their
pilots so they can better compete with lower-cost carriers. Still, pilots
at American and Delta have recently announced a willingness to consider
wage and work-rule changes on short-haul routes that airlines have been
farming out to other carriers.
   There's still one unsettling question as the industry reaches cruising
altitude: Will airline mergers mar the flight plan? A new round of
dealmaking could distract execs from rebuilding balance sheets and
improving service. United Airlines Inc. decided last year not to pursue a
marriage with USAir Inc. And American says it won't strike first. Still, no
one rules out a new wave of merger mania in 1996.
   Railroads, in contrast, are already pursuing bold combinations. Union
Pacific Corp. is seeking government approval for its $3.9 billion
acquisition of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. Its deal comes in response to
Burlington Northern Inc.'s $4 billion purchase last year of Santa Fe
Pacific Corp., creating, at least for now, the nation's largest railroad.
And takeover rumors continue to swirl around companies such as Conrail Inc.
Meanwhile, U.S. railroads are expected to be bidders this year in the
privatization of Mexico's railroads.
   Even without such deals, investors have much to cheer about. Merrill
Lynch & Co. analyst Michael H. Lloyd expects modest revenue gains of 4% to
5% this year for the major railroads, but operating profits should grow at
double that pace, thanks to productivity increases and cost-cutting. The
new Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., for example, has already slashed
jobs and has also identified almost $1 billion in operating cost savings
over the next few years.
   Labor remains a wild card as the railroad industry bargains with about a
dozen unions to reach new contracts. But bargaining is off to a strong
start with a tentative accord with the United Transportation Union,
representing 25% of workers.
   Truckers are hoping simply to bounce back from a bleak 1995. The
industry has been hammered by a slowing of U.S. economic growth, a downturn
in exports to Mexico, and excess capacity. After a banner 1994, bullish
trucking companies rapidly expanded their fleets with bigger trucks. Now,
with softer demand and lackluster earnings, analysts expect a shakeout.
Swift Transportation Co., for one, is hoping to benefit: The company has
made four acquisitions since 1991 and is prowling for more. Truckers will
have to satisfy themselves with such hardscrabbling while railroads and
airlines enjoy a relatively smooth ride.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Airline capacity should grow more slowly than traffic, meaning fuller
planes and higher fares.
   -- Railroads are boosting productivity with computerization and faster
locomotives.

Negatives
   -- Airlines will be hard-pressed to win cost reductions from labor when
profits are soaring.
   -- The trucking industry is suffering from excess capacity.
   -- Railroads have yet to sign contracts with about a dozen unions.

WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE ARE MISTAKES

By:
EDITED BY AMY DUNKIN
Grace Weinstein

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis made the right moves when it came to estate
planning. Many people do not, deterred either by the thought of dying or by
the seeming complexity of well-made plans.
   Don't be put off. After all, you can't take it with you. If you're not
careful, however, you can sure make a mess of leaving it behind, making
Uncle Sam richer and your family poorer in the process. ``It'' is your
hard-earned property. The mess is what happens if you make one of these
all-too-common estate planning mistakes:
-- Ignoring the whole thing. Seven out of 10 Americans reportedly die
without making a will. ``The single most important thing you can do,'' says
Stephan Leimberg, professor of taxation and estate planning at The American
College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., ``is get your papers in order and figure out
what you want to do.''
   Then, follow through. Remember, if you die without a will, you're
leaving it up to your state to decide who gets what. If you're married,
your assets may be split among your spouse and children. If your children
are minors, your spouse would then have to get permission from the court to
spend ``their'' money on their behalf. If you're not married, your closest
blood relatives would inherit your worldly possessions--even if you have a
close friend you would prefer.
   Living trusts, pushed in some quarters as a probate-free substitute for
a will, have advantages and disadvantages. A living trust, which is
revocable and takes assets out of your name, can be helpful if you live in
one of the few states, such as California, with high probate fees or if you
want backup should you become incapacitated. A living trust is a good
``standby vehicle,'' says Bill Knox, a trust attorney with Neuberger &
Berman in New York, because the trustees you have named can manage your
affairs if you cannot. But you won't save on income taxes with a living
trust. And, unless all of your assets are owned by the trust, you won't
avoid probate. You'll still need a will to take care of any assets not
sheltered by the trust at the time of your death.
   You can prepare a legal will yourself, using software programs such as
Nolo's WillMaker (about $40, 800 992-6656). But if your affairs are
complicated--if you have remarried or own investment real estate--you would
be better off consulting an attorney experienced in estate planning.
   Once you draft it, don't file your will and forget it. Make a list of
all your assets and liabilities, so that your family won't flounder in
ignorance when you're gone. Then keep this list current and review your
will every few years, more often if there are changes in tax law or your
own family circumstances. Marriage, divorce, newborn children or
grandchildren, or a move to another state should all be triggers for
updating your will.
-- Using the $600,000 exemption from federal estate taxes only once. Joint
ownership can undermine good estate planning by wasting the second $600,000
estate exemption otherwise available to the surviving spouse. So can using
what Ralph Engel, an attorney with Rosen & Reade in New York, calls a
``sweetheart will,'' in which you leave everything to your spouse.
Solution: Divide assets so that each spouse separately owns at least
$600,000, then leave the first $600,000 in each estate in a bypass or
credit shelter trust. The survivor can receive income from the trust, and
tap principal, but after the second spouse dies the remainder goes to the
children or other designated beneficiaries free from estate tax.
-- Failing to plan specifically for substantial retirement assets.
Accumulated retirement funds--individual retirement account, 401(k), or
profit-sharing--make up a large portion of the estate for many
middle-income Americans. In fact, it can be difficult for some couples to
divvy up asset ownership if one spouse has a sizable retirement plan. If
you don't recognize the potential tax bite on large plan accumulations, you
could wind up losing as much as 85% of your retirement money to a
combination of estate, income, and excise taxes.
   Estate taxes start at 37% and go up to as much as 60%. An excise tax of
15% applies to so-called excess accumulations at death of $1.5 million or
so as well as to excess distributions during life of more than about
$150,000 a year (the specific amount is a moving target because it depends
on your age at the time of death and current Internal Revenue Service
interest rate assumptions). Income tax kicks in if your beneficiaries must
pull money out of your ira to pay any estate taxes that may be due.
   You won't solve the problem by putting retirement money in trust. Engel
cites an instance in which a trust was named beneficiary of a six-figure
retirement plan. Because of that setup, the surviving wife, who could
otherwise have left the money untouched until she reached retirement age,
couldn't do an ira rollover, so the money was immediately subject to income
and estate tax.
   One approach is to begin withdrawing your own retirement money early.
Don't wait until the mandated withdrawal age of 70 1/2 if you will be
accumulating so much money that you'll be subject to excise tax. Steven
Lockwood, president of Lockwood Pension Services in New York, suggests that
if you have other assets you can pass to your heirs, you should ``plan to
deplete your ira by age 90'' rather than leaving it in your taxable
estate.
-- Holding on to more money than you need. Successful people sometimes
don't realize until late in life that the government may get half of what
they leave behind. By then, says Knox, ``it's too late to make much of a
dent in the looming tax losses.''
   There are multiple solutions here. Start by making what Knox calls
``invisible lifetime gifts.'' These are grants of up to $10,000 per person
per year, as well as direct payments of tuition or medical bills, that are
not subject to gift tax. Giving these gifts to your family members while
you're alive removes the money--and its subsequent appreciation--from your
taxable estate. By helping your children buy a house or your grandchildren
attend summer camp, such gifts also let you enjoy the fruits of your
generosity along with the recipients.
   If your estate is sizable, you may want to consider making larger gifts
as well. Giving appreciating assets is the idea here, so that future growth
is removed from your taxable estate. The cost basis for determining capital
gains on inherited assets is fixed at the time of death, or ``stepped up''
from the original purchase price, while the cost basis of assets you give
during your life is what you paid. Hold on to assets that have already
appreciated significantly, otherwise your heirs will lose the benefit of
this stepped-up basis at death and owe capital gains when they sell on the
entire appreciation from your date of purchase.
   Gifts of up to $10,000 per year ($20,000 for a married couple) are never
subject to tax. On larger gifts, a gift tax return will have to be filed,
but the tax itself will not be due until your death. That's when the
unified gift and estate tax kicks in on amounts (whether given during life
or after death) in excess of approximately $600,000.
   Charitable gifts can also reap large rewards. The American College's
Leimberg makes reference to Jacqueline Onassis, who may have sheltered as
much as $90 million out of a $100 million estate by setting up a charitable
lead trust. No one knows exactly how much was in the Onassis estate, but
attorneys recognize the astute estate planning.
   With a charitable lead trust, a specific sum is set aside. The charities
of your choice receive a fixed amount each year, typically based on a
percentage of the original amount, for the period of time you specify. At
the end of that period, your children or other beneficiaries receive the
principal. Because the gift to the children has been deferred, Knox
explains, it is discounted for tax purposes. Furthermore, if the trust's
return on investments is higher than anticipated, the excess goes to the
children without tax.
   Charitable lead trusts are most often used by the very wealthy. Their
mirror image, charitable remainder trusts, are more common. With a crt, you
receive both an immediate tax deduction and income during your lifetime
(and, if you wish, that of your spouse), with the principal then going to
charity. No estate taxes are due on amounts left to charity through the
trust.
-- Insisting on simplicity, at the expense of what could be significant tax
savings. Knox points out that people who have built successful businesses
or professional practices are often ``impatient with, or even distrustful
of, estate planning techniques they can't easily understand.'' Used to
making and controlling their destiny, ``they can't bring themselves to do
something complicated that doesn't make complete sense to them, no matter
how great the tax savings for their families,'' he says.
   One approach is to search out good advisers and then rely on their
recommendations. You don't have to understand the technicalities, so long
as you understand the consequences in terms of tax savings and your control
over your assets.
-- Failing to read documents. No matter how good the recommendations from
your advisers, you really do need to peruse all the documents and have your
attorney answer any questions that you may have. Mistakes can creep in if
you're not paying close attention. Michael Allmon, chairman of the
California Society of cpa's estate planning committee in Los Angeles, cites
a client who made several specific bequests of property, but never noticed
that their addresses were incorrectly listed. ``We think we can take care
of his intent,'' Allmon says, ``but we will have to get the court involved
to do so.''
-- Thinking that estate planning is only for the rich. If anything, says
Leimberg, preparing your will is much more critical for the middle
class--or those people with estates under $1 million. ``If a wealthy person
loses $100,000 because of poor or no estate planning, the world won't come
to an end,'' he says. ``But it's tough when you have a smaller estate.'' In
other words, most of us can't afford to make any mistakes.



Five Rules of Estate Planning

MAKE A WILL
This might seem obvious, yet 7 of 10 Americans die without one. If you
neglect this important piece of business, you're essentially granting your
state the right to decide who gets what.

USE A BYPASS TRUST IF MARRIED
For sizable estates, the couple divides the assets and each spouse puts up
to $600,000 in a trust. This ensures that both get to use a $600,000
federal estate tax exemption.

WATCH RETIREMENT ACCUMULATIONS
If your IRA or qualified plan amounts to more than $1.5 million, you may
want to start withdrawals early so you don't bump up against the excise tax
on excess accumulations.

FIND EXPERT HELP
Refer to self-help software and books. But if your affairs are at all
complicated, use an attorney experienced in estate planning. Read
everything and ask questions--even experts make mistakes.

START ``GIFTING'' EARLY
If you have enough to live comfortably, giving up to $10,000 a year
($20,000 for a married couple) to each child and grandchild can greatly
reduce your taxable estate.

STEERING CLEAR OF TITLE TROUBLE

By:
Richard Korman

When stage great Helen Hayes died in 1993, her son, James MacArthur,
inherited her Victorian mansion overlooking the Hudson River in Nyack, N.Y.
MacArthur arranged to sell the house for $730,000 to Christopher and
Georgine Chalsen, who planned to live there with their five children. A few
weeks before the scheduled closing last June, a title researcher found
buried in the public records a 29-year-old right of first refusal that
Hayes had granted to a neighbor. After much frustration and weighing of
legal options, MacArthur honored the agreement, and the neighbors bought
the house. They removed a strip of land connecting the Hayes property and
their own to the river bank and put the house back on the market at
$849,000. With the river access gone, the Chalsens declined to pursue a
deal.
   The fiasco over the Hayes mansion, known as Pretty Penny, is an example
of how a defective title can kill a real estate deal that both parties
badly want to complete. No matter how much you feel that you've finally
found your dream home, don't get in too deep unless you're sure the house
clearly belongs to the seller or that you won't get involved in a
bottomless legal pit. Refusal rights, liens, easements, or boundary
disputes are the type of problems to watch out for.
   But even the seller doesn't always know. MacArthur was unaware that the
refusal right existed, much less that it had passed to the couple next door
when they bought their house from his mother's original neighbors a few
years ago. Hayes had granted an unlimited right to all ``heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, and assigns'' of the neighbors. Says Alan
Wayte, a Los Angeles attorney: ``That's a mistake, and a very common one.''
What Hayes should have done is restrict the refusal right to her original
neighbors or limit its duration.
   The broader issue is that title searches are often left until it's too
late to prevent both parties from spending a lot of money and effort
getting ready to close. A title is evidence that an owner has the right to
possession. Mortgage lenders require a search to assure that the property's
title is free and clear of claims or any other problems. The search may
show that the seller has a former spouse who is a co-owner but knows
nothing of the sale; a trucking company has an easement that allows it to
drive through the property during the night; or that the toolshed was built
two feet over the boundary of a neighbor's lot and the problem needs to be
resolved. It should also show any liens for unpaid taxes or mortgages.
EARLY REQUEST. The key is not to let the title check wait until after you
have completed other aspects of the deal, such as mortgage approval and
arranging to move. If possible, obtain a pre-approved mortgage before going
out to shop for a house, suggests Gary W. Eldred, author of The 106 Common
Mistakes Homebuyers Make (And How to Avoid Them) (John Wiley & Sons,
$14.95). Getting mortgage approval out of the way allows everyone involved
to concentrate on the title and other matters, he says.
   The minute your bid on a house is accepted, start researching the title.
Ask the seller's lawyer or broker to send a copy of the title report from
the property's most recent sale and the proposed contract, says Eric
Gonchar, MacArthur's attorney. Also ask for the most recent property survey
and certificate of occupancy.
   Before the contracts are signed, make sure you or your bank orders the
search from the company that will issue your title insurance. Also get a
copy of the summary report. It shouldn't take longer than two weeks. Don't
wait until the property is appraised or until your loan is approved. If
possible, have the abstract of the title and property survey before your
closing or moving dates are made. That way, if there are problems that will
take weeks or months to resolve, you won't have to undo preparations to
move from your current residence and inconvenience your buyer or tenant.
   Title searches and reports cost $150 to $500 and, if the deal closes,
that cost is rolled into the title-insurance bill. If the title report
turns up information that makes closing impossible, most home-sale
contracts require the seller to pay the buyer's title-search fee and
related title-examination costs.
   Although MacArthur picked up the tab for $1,000 of title-research costs,
Christopher Chalsen says he still spent $700 on the inspection. Chalsen
recalls that he told his lawyer to hurry to get the title information, but
he and his wife signed the contract before the data were in hand. Luckily,
the Chalsens eventually found another house. It hadn't belonged to a famous
actress, but its title was free of anything that could have turned the
purchase of the home into a tragedy.



Before You Seal the Deal...
-- Get the title search done as early as possible, well in advance of
closing and arranging to move. Press lenders, real estate agents, and
attorneys not to neglect this part of the deal. Try to get a mortgage
approved early so you can concentrate on the title.
-- Seek the title data from previous sales and refinancings prior to
signing a contract. Ask for copies of the survey and certificate of
occupancy as a tip-off to trouble involving boundaries or illegal
structures.
-- Always buy title insurance. Be sure the policy covers the owner, not
just the mortgage lender. Try for a policy that insures the full equity in
addition to the mortgage amount.

A PANGLOSS FOR THE MILLENNIUM

By:
BY MICHAEL J. MANDEL

THE STATE OF HUMANITY
Edited by Julian L. Simon
Blackwell 694pp $54.95

No one can accuse Julian L. Simon of thinking small. In his new book, he
tackles nothing less than the fate of all mankind. The State of Humanity, a
massive new volume of essays assembled and edited by Simon, is an attack on
the fashionable notion that human progress has stalled. ``Just about every
important long-run measure of human welfare shows improvement over the
decades and centuries, in the United States as well as in the rest of the
world,'' claims Simon in his introductory essay. ``There is no persuasive
reason to believe that these trends will not continue indefinitely.''
   This happy assessment is no surprise. In previous books, Simon, an
economist at the University of Maryland, has argued the benefits of
population growth and immigration, giving him a well-deserved reputation as
perhaps the most optimistic economist alive. His argument that humanity is
still on an upward trend is backed up by almost 700 pages of hard data and
numerous charts and graphs. Simon and his co-authors, including Nobel
prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel, have put together what is probably
the single most concentrated mass of upbeat statistics ever assembled,
covering virtually every aspect of the human condition, from child
mortality to air pollution, from housing and food to natural resources and
ozone depletion.
   For the most part, the arguments are convincing. We have been warned
that the world is about to run out of oil. Not so, Simon points out: Global
crude-oil reserves have soared over the past 15 years, as higher prices
have stimulated exploration and new technology for exploiting existing
fields. In 1980, the world had about a 30-year supply of crude oil at
current rates of consumption. By the early 1990s, though, the world had
about 45 years' worth. Notes Simon: ``Metals, foods, and other natural
resources have become more available rather than more scarce.''
   The perspective of Simon and his co-authors is decidedly global. While
developed economies such as the U.S. have struggled in recent years,
developing countries such as China, Taiwan, and Malaysia have seen
explosive income growth, making this the greatest period of wealth creation
in history. These economic gains have been accompanied by other advances,
as well. Over the past 30 years, life expectancy in poor countries has
soared, from 46 to 63 years. The spread of education in developing
countries has been equally spectacular: The proportion of children aged 6
to 11 enrolled in school has risen from less than 50% in 1960 to about 70%
today.
   Interestingly, Simon's upbeat view does not depend on new technology.
The State of Humanity barely takes notice of computers. There is no mention
of the Internet, virtual reality, gene splicing, cellular telephones, or
any of the other marvels that are supposed to be boosting productivity and
improving the modern standard of living.
   Instead, Simon bases his forecasts on a simple principle: Assume that
long-term trends will continue, in the absence of convincing evidence to
the contrary. So if the steady accumulation of knowledge has produced a
rising standard of living for the past 200 years, there's no reason to
believe that things will suddenly change.
   Of course, many would consider Simon's view of the world to be naive.
The conventional wisdom is that global overpopulation is inexorably leading
to ecological and economic disaster--a modern version of Malthusian misery.
``For those who think the future may be a simple extrapolation of the past,
there may be some surprises ahead,'' observes Lester R. Brown, president of
Worldwatch Institute, in the forthcoming book State of the World 1996
(Norton). Brown, as committed a pessimist as Simon is an optimist, argues
that the ``spiraling human demands for resources are beginning to outgrow
the capacity of the earth's natural systems.''
   Food, especially, will be in short supply, in part because the people of
China and other growing nations will demand better diets as they become
richer. Notes Brown: ``Oil can be replaced with other energy sources, but
there is no replacement for food.''
   The State of Humanity tries to answer each of these negative arguments.
Despite the fears, Simon cites statistics from the Environmental Protection
Agency to assert that ``the air in the U.S. and in other rich countries is
irrefutably safer to breathe now than in decades past.'' Moreover, there is
no sign of any widespread food shortages yet. Crop yields have risen as
fast as world population. The price of food, like that of other natural
resources, is still falling compared with other goods and services.
   Simon points out that in every era, there have been doomsayers who see
the imminent end of civilization. For example, in the mid-1800s, the
British began to worry about running out of coal. Writes Simon: ``The great
English economist, Stanley Jevons, calculated that a shortage of coal would
bring England's industry to a standstill by 1900; he carefully assessed
that oil could never make a decisive difference.''
   Despite the power of its arguments, The State of Humanity does have some
flaws. The essays are of uneven quality--Simon's own contributions,
especially the introduction, are pointed and well-written, but some of the
other chapters are confusing and less than helpful. The book also suffers
from overkill. One grows weary of being told over and over how everything
is getting better all the time.
   Moreover, while whining about how the pessimists get more attention than
he does, Simon does not acknowledge that scaremongers are often responsible
for much of the improvement he cites. The death rate from all accidents,
for example, dropped by more than 20% over the past 10 years--thanks in no
small part to the consumer-safety advocates Simon professes to deplore.
Indeed, it may very well be that alarmism is the only way to stimulate an
effective response to large-scale problems, such as global warming and
ozone depletion, that require concerted multinational action.
   Still, The State of Humanity will become essential reading for anyone
who wants to put today's policy debates into a larger context. At a time
when politicians are locked in a bloody stalemate in Washington and many
Americans are disappointed with their lot, it's worth remembering the
progress that the human species has already made--and pondering the
potential for gains to come.

INTERNET 101 FOR BUSINESS

By:
BY IRA SAGER

THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence
By Don Tapscott
McGraw-Hill 342pp $24.95

Surf the Net these days and you'll soon find, alongside the obscure 'zines
and hip cyber hangouts, some of the biggest names in business. Kodak,
Aetna, AT&T, Eli Lilly, IBM--each has a home page on the World Wide Web.
They and scores of other companies hope online networks can provide a
direct link to the customer and a whole new realm of electronic commerce.
   Today, however, most are sputtering along the Information Highway,
offering little more than electronic brochures. To get beyond that, argues
Don Tapscott in The Digital Economy, businesses must build fundamentally
new strategies for competing in the electronic marketplace. ``When
information becomes digital and networked, walls fall and no business is
safe,'' Tapscott writes. On the other hand, companies that understand the
Net will blossom.
   Tapscott's mission is not to tell executives how to craft I-way
strategies but to help them grasp the changes the Net will bring so they
can start planning. This isn't uncharted territory: Tapscott, a consultant
who has written often on information technology, follows countless magazine
and book writers in predicting how the computing, telecommunications, and
media industries will converge. While he points out the possibilities, he
offers few fresh insights. He cites other consultants and quotes liberally
from business publications. Also, many of the companies Tapscott hails as
pioneers--Federal Express, Wal-Mart, Levi Strauss--are already well known
for their online strategies.
   Tapscott does well weaving into one tome the business, social, and
educational implications of networks. He lays out privacy and censorship
issues, and explores the Net's potential to change the way people interact
with the government. He also raises important questions about inequality
and the need to extend the Net to a broad base of citizens. The Digital
Economy doesn't offer solutions, but it can help executives contemplating
cyberspace to ask the right questions.

`I WANT BLOOD FOR BLOOD'

By:
JAMES DRAKE

In the north Albanian village of Bluji, deep in the Dukagjin highlands,
women and children do most of the work. Grandmothers scrub laundry on the
doorsteps of stone cottages. Young wives--some heavily pregnant--lug pails
of water along the rutted cart track from the communal well. Five-year-olds
spend long days in the fields tending scrawny livestock.
   Bluji's menfolk hold antiquated notions of gender roles, but it's fear
that keeps most of them from showing their faces: This is the land of the
blood feud, a centuries-old tradition. Kept in check during the communists'
rule, it reemerged three years ago, forcing some 10,000 able-bodied
breadwinners, out of a population of 3 million, into hiding.
SHAMEFUL. ``I want blood for blood,'' spits Nasi Gjini, polishing the
pre-1914 Lee Enfield rifle that has been his constant companion since his
two sons were shot to death by a neighbor in February. The deaths followed
an exchange of drunken insults. Now, the teenage assassin, his three
brothers, and his father stay indoors, thwarting Gjini's quest for revenge.
A murderer's male kin are fair game, but gunning them down in their own
house is more shameful than the original offense. ``Here I am safe,'' says
the Gjinis' killer, peering through the bars on his window. ``But this is
no kind of life. Only Allah knows how long I'll have to stay here.'' He
spends his days smoking, sleeping, and playing cards.
   The blood feud goes back to the 12th century and was a means of meting
out summary justice. After World War II, under dictator Enver Hoxha, the
practice was suppressed, with murderers executed and their families
ostracized. But with the fall of the regime, old ways quickly returned.
   The circle of violence is taking an economic toll among the hot-tempered
subsistence farmers. When Albania opened its doors for business, some
multinationals came courting the highlanders, bringing hard currency.
Leisure giants such as Club Med talked of opening ski resorts and hiking
lodges on the country's game-packed slopes and sending whitewater rafts
down its salmon rivers.
   ``But even if they had found local partners they could trust, there
would be no guarantee those partners would be alive the next morning,''
says Adnan Rama of the Albanian Tourist Ministry. Potential investors
backed off, taking their dollars and Deutschemarks with them. Most folks
run livestock on land too poor for farming. Some make a better living
smuggling oil, weapons, liquor and cigarettes to Serbia and Bosnia. But the
average income is just $30 per month.
   The Dukagjin district has seen some 350 revenge killings since 1993, and
the problem is spreading: Hill people who migrate to the cities in search
of work take their quarrels with them. ``I'd say around 20% of our murders
this year were connected to the feuds,'' estimates Shkelqim Merdani, police
chief in Tirana, the capital.
   In a bid to stop the madness, Islamic cleric Ndrek Pjetri formed the
Missionaries of Reconciliation, a group of holy men dedicated to ending
feuds. Its members act as go-betweens, often persuading the aggrieved party
to accept cash in place of blood. The mullah has even traveled to Turkey
and Germany to settle quarrels between expatriate Albanians, and in 1994,
he successfully petitioned the U.S. Embassy in Tirana to cancel a visa
granted to a man bound for New York to carry out a killing.
   For many here, honor means more than anything. Last year, on his 16th
birthday, a boy traveled to nearby Kopliku to avenge the killing of his
grandfather 40 years ago by a brutal police captain. Reaching Kopliku, he
found the killer had died. So he called out the captain's cousin, bade him
greet the grandfather, and dispatched him with a single bullet, thereby
removing a stain on his family's honor. The boy himself was killed before
he turned 17.
   The 68-year-old Pjetri claims to have resolved more than 170 disputes,
but new ones crop up too fast for the pack mules he uses to travel to
isolated villages. By the time he arrives, another murder may have taken
place. So he has applied for a government grant to buy a four-wheel-drive
vehicle. ``They say there isn't money,'' he says. ``I've told them they
should see it as an investment.''

IT'S FOR YOU--ON THE PC
Voice calling via the Internet is here and it's cheap-but don't toss your
phone yet

By:
BY JOHN W. VERITY

There's little, it seems, that the Internet doesn't provide: low-cost
electronic publishing, global E-mail delivery, instant access to every kind
of digital information and service. Now, it's promising ``free'' phone
calls between any two Net computers, more or less, and for no more money
than the usual connection fee.
   As it turns out, this is another one of those Internet concepts that
seem to offer exciting potential if not high-quality results just yet. It's
sort of like the idea of finding whatever information you need on the Net.
Sure, its computers are crammed with information, but as all Web surfers
soon discover, much of it is trivial.
MEETING PLACE. Likewise, the Internet can transmit speech cheaply, but not
in a satisfying or easy way. Right now, an Internet voice call has little
of the tone or intimacy of a regular phone call. It's more like talking
over CB radio. Still, it costs little to try, and when they work well,
Internet voice calls can be entertaining and useful. Besides saving money
on long-distance communications--even across oceans--Internet phoning can
enhance computer games. Eventually, phoning via the Internet may serve as
an inexpensive method for training and conference calls.
   How to get started? First, you'll need basic Internet knowhow and some
patience. For hardware, you'll need a Windows-compatible computer with a
50-megahertz 486 processor, a sound card, a speaker, and a microphone.
(Most Internet phone-software packages work only with Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows, but there are programs available for Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintoshes and for Unix computers.) A 28.8-kilobits-per-second modem is
best, though some packages can work with 14.4-kbs models. Also required is
a SLIP/PPP connection to the Internet.
   There's already a choice of software. Trial versions are available at no
charge directly from the Web sites of several suppliers (table). Even in
compressed form, these lengthy programs can take 15 minutes or more to
download into your machine. Also, each is programmed to work only for a
limited time. VocalTec Inc.'s Internet Phone allows just 60 seconds of
calling time, for instance. You're free to take more than one copy--or pay
$49.95 for a limitless version. Internet Telephone Co.'s WebPhone program,
which was available free prior to Jan. 1, 1996, now costs $49.95.
   Each program does essentially the same thing--make your PC's sound card
convert the microphone's analog signals into a string of digital packets of
data that move separately across the Net like envelopes in a postal system.
Depending on the Net's traffic conditions at any given moment, consecutive
packets may take different routes through the Net and arrive out of order.
At the receiving end, telephony software will try to compensate, but it's
often impossible for the program to reconstruct the original signal
completely.
   None of this software is simple to install or use. There are numerous
network and computer parameters to set, and you'll need to plug in
specifics about your Internet addressing, for instance. It took me and a
friend more than an hour to get VocalTec's package to work. For WebPhone, I
sought the supplier's assistance.
TOUGH TALK. Once we had the software installed, we found out just how
different from conventional telephone calling Internet phone setups are.
The sound is choppy, syllables drop out of words, and it can take several
seconds for voices to traverse the Net. Each party must take turns
speaking--and they must be using the same brand of software. You must
either arrange a time to converse or scan your supplier's online directory
to find others around the world who are online and looking for
conversation. Directories often list people's preferred topics of
conversation, which range from the personal to lofty technical matters.
   Which software to choose? As the first to market, VocalTec's package has
become the most popular. Internet Telephone's WebPhone looks the best--like
a futuristic telephone with lots of point-and-click buttons. Quarterdeck
Corp. plans to enhance its WebTalk with a variety of multimedia tools to
help people collaborate over the Internet. You can keep up with the
technology's rapid evolution by seeing what enthusiasts post to the
independently run Voice on the Net E-mail list: Send the message,
``subscribe von-digest,'' to majordomo@pulver.com.
   For now, Internet telephony reminds me of the dancing elephant in a
circus: One is more impressed that it can dance at all than with the dance
itself. But at this stage, teaching the Internet new dances is really what
it's all about.

WHY IS THE U.S. SETTLING FOR STUNTED GROWTH?

By:
BY PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS

Economic growth has fallen on hard times. The budget struggle between
Congress and the Clinton Administration has been partly over whether the
economy will grow 2.3% annually or 2.5%. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan has hinted that even this slow growth might not be possible
without a balanced budget.
   It was not always so. In the postwar era, growth was a liberal mantra.
Not even inflation-shy Republican Administrations could withstand its
imperative. The Ford Administration, for example, forecast a growth rate of
5.98% in average annual real gross national product for the 1976-80 period.
The Carter Administration brought us into the 1980s with a 4.7% average
annual real GNP growth projection for 1979-83.
   The attitude toward growth changed remarkably in 1981, when the Reagan
Administration forecast a 3.8% annual rate of real GNP growth from 1981 to
1985. The forecast was paltry compared with those for earlier periods and
was no higher than what the economy achieved from 1976 to 1980. But the
hyperbole flew fast. Reagan's forecast was denounced as a ``rosy scenario''
that ``lies far beyond the limits of any past experience in this country or
any other industrial democracy'' (The Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1981).
COOLED PASSION. What happened in such a short time span to make modest
economic-growth projections unwelcome? Environmental hysteria connecting
growth with pollution took a toll, as did the rising inflation that had
accompanied growth in the 1970s. But among macroeconomists themselves, the
cooled passion for growth may have reflected the change in the way it was
being pursued.
   In the postwar era, prosperity-peddling Keynesians connected economic
growth with the growth of government. True, in the Keynesian model, a tax
cut that increased the deficit would raise aggregate demand and economic
growth, but the tax cut multiplier was less than the government-spending
multiplier. That is, if economic growth was the goal, more government
spending was the efficient way to achieve it. Keynesian economics was a
political success because it merged economic growth with liberal compassion
and the propensity of politicians to build spending constituencies.
Moreover, the Keynesian model relied on a proactive government to manage
aggregate demand and produce full employment. Policymakers found this to be
a more gratifying approach than laissez-faire.
   Reagan's growth program was unpopular with macroeconomists because it
was not premised on the growth of government. Indeed, Reagan wanted to
curtail the growth of government, while increasing economic incentives to
individuals. This cut to the emotional core, and liberals who couldn't get
enough ``Keynesian'' growth were horrified at the prospect of
``supply-side'' growth.
   For many, supply-side economics has an even worse strike against it. It
maintains that fiscal policy works not by increasing aggregate demand, but
by raising aftertax rewards for work and investment. Supply-side economics
not only tolerates market-based income differences--it also links tax
policy with productivity growth and shows the high cost of using taxes to
level incomes.
   Liberal economists have responded not by resurrecting Keynesian demand
management--an impossible task--but by deemphasizing growth. One way of
doing this is to argue that regardless of policy, the economy cannot grow
any faster than its long-term average of 2.5% annually. Liberals then
narrowly limit economics to ``fairness'' issues. For example, Paul R.
Krugman, an economist at Stanford University, says that with a long-term
growth potential of 2.5%, it is pointless to increase incentives when the
only effect is more economic inequality.
   A downsizing of growth ambitions requires harsher cutbacks in welfare
and entitlements in order to contain the deficit or balance the budget. It
also means that policymakers cannot rely on income growth to compensate for
the slower growth in government programs or on job growth to absorb the
inflow of legal and illegal immigrants. The social and political
implications of slow growth may well prove more unpalatable than
``greed.''
   From 1982 to 1989, the U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of
3.7%. The new ``2.5% inevitable growth school'' may argue either that these
seven years of above-inevitable growth occurred at the expense of future
growth or compensated for below-inevitable growth in the past. But the fact
remains that people experienced 3.7%, not the long-run average. The
electorate liked it, and the Washington policymakers who took it away are
history.

FED FEAR OF THE JOBLESS RATE
It may be a faulty inflation signal


By:
BY GENE KORETZ

Though they welcome the Federal Reserve's latest cut in short-term interest
rates, economists Mickey D. Levy of NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc. and
Joseph Carson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. both believe that Fed policy
remains far too restrictive in the face of growing economic weakness. As
they see it, the largest roadblock to a substantial easing of monetary
policy may well be the Fed's unjustified concern regarding the low
unemployment rate.
   Fed officials, says Levy, tend to believe in a so-called natural rate of
unemployment--that is, a rate at which labor markets are so tight that
further declines would spark rising inflation. Though estimates of that
rate have varied from 4% in the 1960s to 6.5% in the 1970s, the current
level is presumed to be just below 6%--placing November's 5.6% jobless rate
in the danger zone.
   Levy argues, however, that productivity progress by U.S. business
combined with the Fed's enhanced inflation-fighting credibility have
effectively lowered the natural rate of unemployment well below the
5.5%-to-6% range. By reaping productivity gains from restructuring and more
flexible use of labor (including contingent workers), as well as from
increased investment in technology, says Levy, business has improved its
resiliency in labor markets and boosted its leverage in wage bargaining.
   Meanwhile, growing job insecurity has made employees more docile. And
the Fed's tough anti-inflation stance has curbed employers' ability to pay
for wage hikes by raising prices. All of which, says Levy, suggests that
today's 5.6% jobless rate is far from a danger signal of impending
inflation.
   For his part, Carson notes that the meager 607,000 rise in employment
over the past 12 months (as measured by the Labor Dept.'s survey of
households) was matched by unusually sluggish labor force growth of just
724,000 people. This is only half of the 1.1% growth in the labor force in
1994 (chart), which was right in line with Labor Dept. projections.
   Carson attributes this sharp drop in labor force growth to declines in
labor force participation by 20-to-24-year-old and 55-to-64-year-old males.
He speculates that poor job prospects in 1995 inspired more young workers
to stay in school, while continued downsizing eroded the ranks of older
workers. In any case, he says, ``the thing to remember is that the
unemployment rate would be a half a percentage point higher if the labor
force had expanded at its trend rate.''
   Either Levy's or Carson's analysis may explain why inflation has stayed
so low with 5.6% unemployment. If, as seems likely, they are both right,
the Fed has more than ample room to ease aggressively in the months ahead.

WHAT'S STALLING MONETARY UNION
Europe's economies are out of sync


By:
BY GENE KORETZ

At first blush, the wave of European interest-rate cuts touched off by the
Bundesbank's latest move would seem to suggest that economic convergence is
growing. Christopher Widness of Chemical Securities Inc. points out,
however, that despite the synchronous rate cuts, the differences between
inflation rates (and interest rates) have actually widened. A year ago, for
example, French inflation was nearly a percentage point lower than German
inflation. Today it is higher. And the gaps between German inflation and
inflation in Spain and Italy have grown (chart).
   The irony, says Widness, is that in many countries, such as Italy and
Spain, fiscal restraint could boost inflation as sales tax hikes feed into
the price indexes and inspire wage pressures. And that spells increased
political strains that could short-circuit progress toward economic
convergence and monetary union.

A MILESTONE FOR BLACK FAMILIES
Fewer out-of-wedlock births

By:
BY GENE KORETZ

As reported by The Numbers News newsletter, black families in America have
made significant progress in at least one key area in recent years:
Birthrates among unmarried black women--including teenagers--declined in
1993 for the fourth year in a row. The birthrate fell from 90.7 per 1,000
unmarried black women age 15 to 44 in 1989 to 84.0 in 1993. By contrast,
the birthrate among unmarried white women, though far below that of blacks,
continues to rise sharply--from 30.2 in 1989 to 35.9 in 1993.

WHEN LAWYERS ARE LOOKERS
Attractiveness boosts earnings

By:
BY GENE KORETZ

Other things being equal, better-looking lawyers make more money than their
unattractive colleagues. That's the implication of a new study that looks
at how law school graduates of the 1970s fared in labor markets in
subsequent years. In the study, economists Jeff E. Biddle of Michigan State
University and Daniel S. Hamermesh of the University of Texas developed
attractiveness ratings based on class photos of students of a top law
school and then used survey data to gauge their career progress five and 15
years after graduation.
   The results indicated that attractive male attorneys (there were few
women in the group studied) made more money than plain or homely attorneys
after five years of practice, and the gap widened over time. Further, more
of the attractive group tended to become litigators, a specialty where good
looks are a likely asset, and to work in the higher-paying private sector,
where client relationships have a larger effect on earnings.
   Interestingly enough, the researchers found little payoff to
attractiveness among law school graduates of the 1980s. And while good
looks boosted the chances of males grads of both the 1970s and 1980s being
offered a law firm partnership after only five years of practice, they
actually lowered the chances of early partnership for young female
lawyers.

YOU MADE THE CALL

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

THE THIRD ANNUAL UP FRONT Reader Survey is gleaned from 288 responses to
our questionnaire, almost half via E-mail. It shows a sober group that's
cautiously optimistic and doesn't expect miracles.
   We asked about job security for the second year in a row. And the
answers were pretty close to last year's. In a time of corporate
downsizing, the share of those feeling less secure at work rose slightly,
from 32% to 36%, while people who are more secure was virtually unchanged.
Yet, despite all the gloom and doom we hear about how too few are saving
enough for old age, two-thirds project their old-age standard of living to
remain as is or get better.
   About the stock market, the consensus is for continued good times, with
an average prediction of 5754 for the Dow's 1996 high. Most
prognostications clustered in the 5251-6000 range. There's no consensus on
a favorite stock, though, with names scattered all over. The No.1 pick is a
tie between Microsoft and Intel, with 14 responses each.
   On matters not affecting them directly, namely the federal budget,
readers go for the conventional wisdom. Most name 2002 as the best target
date to balance the budget. Newt Gingrich wants to do the deed by then.
Now, so does Bill Clinton. There's a tempered optimism on the much
ballyhooed Information Highway. While a majority sees the Infobahn as the
driving force of tomorrow's economy, skeptics abound: To more than 40%,
it's just hype.

A FEW NEW BLOTS ON THE LEDGER
Delinquent consumer loans and skinny margins may temper an otherwise bully
year

By:
By Kelley Holland in New York, with Amy Barrett in Washington


It was beginning to look as if the good times would never end for U.S.
banks. Since 1991, profits have set record after record, asset quality has
sharply improved, and bank stocks have seemed headed for the moon. But now,
a few clouds are dotting the horizon. Consumers are beginning to have
trouble with heavy debt burdens. And the narrow gap between short- and
long-term rates bodes ill for banks' profit margins on loans and
investments. Although Merrill Lynch & Co. predicts that profits for 56 top
banks should grow 9.8% in 1996 (chart), pan in for a closeup and the
picture is murkier.
   The biggest potential problem is related to the ongoing growth in
lending. Consumer installment credit grew roughly 14% in 1995, according to
DRI/McGraw-Hill. While banks profit initially by providing that credit,
heavy consumer debt burdens mean more loan delinquencies down the road.
Indeed, the American Bankers Assn. says that late payments on bank-card
accounts have risen for four quarters in a row and are currently at their
second-highest level in 10 years. ``Consumer credit quality is, I think, a
very big short-term issue, potentially a big minefield,'' says Judah
Kraushaar, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch.
HARD TO FUDGE. Corporate lending is also expanding rapidly, raising
additional concerns about loan quality in 1996. James B. Lee, vice-chairman
at Chemical Banking Corp., the top bank in loan syndications, says
corporate lending will increase through 1996, but ``certain [industry]
sectors will continue to deteriorate.'' That will prompt some borrowers to
fall behind on payments or default. Lee says lending standards are far
higher than they were in the late 1980s. However, the intense competition
to make many loans suggests that some banks are willing to offer loan terms
that leave little room for error.
   Then there is the problem of profit margins. Today, there's less than
one percentage point between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and
the longer-term rates at which they typically lend. That means room for
profits is scarce. A 1995 study by Merrill Lynch shows that bank stocks
have been poor performers nearly every year following periods when short-
and long-term interest rates are close together. ``This is a hard yield
curve to work with,'' says Jeffrey C. Keil, president of Republic New York
Corp.
   Luckily, banks still have plenty of wind at their backs. While loan
delinquencies are rising, they are still relatively scarce, and banks need
to use only small portions of their earnings as reserves for bad credits.
Moreover, new businesses are expanding for some of the biggest banks. At
J.P. Morgan & Co., Thomas B. Ketchum, head of investment banking for the
Americas, expects corporate-finance fees for services such as advising on
mergers to increase 40% in 1996.
   Expect many banks to be intensely cost-conscious in the coming year.
Bank mergers will likely continue at gale force: Gerard Smith, managing
director in the financial institutions group of UBS Securities Inc.,
predicts that by 2000, the top 50 banks will control 80% of the assets in
the U.S. banking industry, up from 56% today. And many deals will be
predicated on massive cost savings.
REFORM DELAY. Spending on technology will grow in 1996. Most bankers, eager
to see their customers reduce their use of high-cost branches and step up
use of electronic banking outlets, are placing large bets on systems for
banking by phone or personal computer. Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., chairman
and CEO of First Union Corp. and one of the country's most acquisitive
bankers, plans to stop buying banks for five years while he invests in
electronic retail banking. ``As soon as we really do have a choice for the
customer to make that's realistic, then he will move away from branches,''
he says.
   Changes will be harder to come by on the regulatory front. Banks have
been stymied on the big revisions they sought in 1995, such as an end to
the barriers between commercial and investment banking, and they could well
be frustrated again. Banks and insurance agents need to agree on provisions
to limit the forays of banks into the insurance business before such
banking law reform can move forward.
   Having waited this long for deregulation, bank executives aren't holding
their breath. However, for those who keep a sharp eye on operations, pay
close attention to the creditworthiness of borrowers, and plan for
electronic banking, 1996 could be a very good year indeed.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The financial condition of banks is excellent and leaves them well
prepared to weather any economic slowdown.
   -- Managed properly, the ongoing consolidation in the industry will make
it more efficient.

Negatives
   -- Consumers have been loading up on debt, and consumer loan
delinquencies are rising.
   -- Profit margins on consumer and corporate loans could decline, hurting
bank earnings.

JOHN DEWEY, MEET PETER DRUCKER

By:
By Paul Magnusson in Washington


Your revenues are rising, but not as fast as the cost of serving customers.
Labor costs are climbing, but antiquated work rules and poor morale limit
your flexibility. Your overseas competitors pay more, spend lavishly on
training, and get far better results. Your physical plant is crumbling.
Computers are scarce. And your customers are dissatisfied.
   Welcome to America's public school system. Its problems are so profound
and its disorganization so pervasive that it would be a challenge to the
savviest of America's business managers. Just for starters: There is no
central management--only 16,000 local school districts run by amateur
boards pursuing their own agendas: football, creationism, condom
distribution.
   The school-board situation isn't going to change anytime soon, since
local control is considered an inalienable right in America. But some help
for what ails the schools is on the way, thanks to contemporary management
theory. Two related movements--toward school choice and school
standards--have far more to do with Peter F. Drucker than with John Dewey.
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. School-choice advocates hope to foster competition
among schools. That way, the weakest schools will lose students and either
improve or fold. The strongest schools will prosper and expand. One plan
would offer vouchers for purchasing education from existing private and
public schools. Vouchers are strongly opposed by teachers' unions and the
Clinton Administration. They argue that some kids will be left in bad
schools and some schools will use the wrong lures--such as lavish spending
on sports. Still, Republicans will give school choice a boost if their
numbers increase in state legislatures this year.
   Other reformers favor charter schools that contract to provide education
to willing public-school students. Often operating out of storefronts or
underused public buildings and free of bureaucracy, charter schools are
generally cost-effective. These schools must demonstrate results or lose
their charters. There are some 245 of them in 19 states. ``This is just
applying America's entrepreneurial spirit to the school,'' says Joseph
Nathan, director of the Center for School Change, a research group in
Minnesota that is tracking the trend.
   Curriculum reform based on setting universal standards of knowledge is
progressing much faster. It is based on sound business principles: First
you decide what students should learn, and then you hold teachers and
administrators accountable. ``In states where they take standards
seriously, they have seemed to make a difference,'' says Marc Tucker,
president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, which helps
schools in the standards effort. Critics complain that teachers will
concentrate on drilling students to pass tests instead of pursuing broader
educational objectives. Still, parents seem to like the results. In their
second year of a standards-based curriculum, Maryland students boosted
their scores by 25%.
   Pressure for schools to become more efficient is intense. Immigration is
swelling enrollments. The number of students with limited proficiency in
English jumped by 26% during the 1980s. And children who require special
education increased by 15% over the past decade. ``We've got a whole influx
of kids who have been exposed to alcohol and drugs, hurt by environmental
contaminants, or diagnosed with learning difficulties,'' says Kathy
Christie, a Denver-area school board member and an analyst at the Education
Commission of the States.
FALLING BEHIND. All this is happening as an unpaid bill for neglect of
school buildings is coming due. One-third of America's schools, serving
some 14 million students, require extensive repair or replacement,
according to a 1995 report by the General Accounting Office. A quarter of
all public schools lack sufficient computers, and 42% have inadequate
science laboratories, says the GAO.
   That is a lot for local school boards to deal with. Without a clear
focus on educational goals, they tend to ``pay too much attention to
asbestos and not enough to training teachers and developing curriculum,''
says Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences. American
science scholarship in grade school is falling behind because much of the
industrialized world pays ``enormously more attention to teacher refresher
courses and to professional development,'' says Alberts.
   America's management gurus may not have the whole solution. But the
notion that schools must measure and improve their output--graduates who
can read and do math--can only help.

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK

By:
By Mike McNamee in Washington, with Richard A. Melcher in Chicago,
Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City, Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and bureau

On medieval maps, the terra incognita around the borders was festooned with
whirlpools, dragons, and dire warnings: ``Here there be monsters!'' In
1996, as the U.S. economy sails into uncharted waters, its map might well
be decorated with cherubs and zephyrs. Refreshed after 1995's slowdown and
wafted along by falling interest rates, American business should glide into
1996, leaving in its wake steady if not sparkling growth through the sixth
year of expansion.
   Favorable portents abound. Congress and the White House seem certain to
deliver a plan to whack hundreds of billions out of federal deficits over
the last half of the '90s. Even with the budget unresolved, the Federal
Reserve cut short-term interest rates on Dec. 19 from 5.75% to 5.5%--the
first of three 25-basis-point cuts that Fed-watchers expect by the end of
1996. That's welcome news: ``We'll see growth in '96, but I think we'll see
more of it if the Fed keeps lowering rates,'' says Ross J. Centanni,
president of air-compressor maker Gardner Denver Machinery Inc.
   Coupled with continued low inflation, the Fed's easing will ratify the
remarkable rally in bond prices, keeping crucial long-term rates down. That
will provide a lift to housing and commercial real estate. And America's
top trading partners should struggle out of their 1995 doldrums and buy
more from U.S. manufacturers.
SCROOGES GALORE. That's not to say that business will sail effortlessly
through the year. The 23 industries profiled by BUSINESS WEEK in this
year's Industry Outlook will need skillful navigation to steer through
shifting currents. The sectors that will lead the way through 1996 will
either enjoy continuing strong demand--such as semiconductor makers or Wall
Street's securities houses--or, like defense manufacturers, will continue
to squeeze more profits out of shrinking sales.
   Laggards will find themselves on the wrong side of 1996's negative
trends: slower growth in capital spending, pressure on pricing, and
tight-fisted consumers. After a three-year modernization binge with
12%-plus growth rates in capital spending, investment in producers' durable
equipment will rise only 6% in 1996, after adjustment for inflation. Even
computer makers will lose some altitude, with inflation-adjusted sales
rising 18% in 1996, vs. 27.1% growth in 1995, according to forecasts by
DRI/McGraw-Hill.
   The '90s efficiency boom will spell trouble for any producer trying to
raise prices in 1996. In a BUSINESS WEEK/Harris Executive Poll in December
(page 76), only 40% of the executives surveyed predict they will raise
prices in 1996, down from the 63% who were confident of price hikes before
1995 began. ``We're in a buyer's market,'' says Bradford W. Hildebrandt, a
management consultant to law firms. And carmakers, restaurateurs,
retailers, and other businesses catering to consumers will find they're
dealing with wary customers, thanks to debt burdens that have hit a record
19% of disposable income. ``Debt is putting a lot of pressure on
households, particularly the under-$50,000 families'' who are the core of
the mass market, says economist Mark M. Zandi of forecasters Regional
Financial Associates.
   But even careful consumers will spend enough to keep the economy
growing. Jobs and income will keep rising, and inflation will stay low,
with consumer prices up about 2.9%. That will help keep long-term interest
rates near their low 1995 levels, with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond
averaging 6.3% for 1996. All told, BUSINESS WEEK expects the economy to
turn in a better performance in 1996 than 1995: The gross domestic product
will grow about 2.3%, after inflation, from the fourth quarter of 1995 to
the end of 1996. That's up from the 2% expected when the books are closed
on 1995 (charts, pages 74, 74A).
   That 2.3% growth may not sound like much, but, remember, the scale for
measuring the economy is changing. The Commerce Dept. is adjusting the way
it calculates growth in GDP--in particular, how much of growth represents a
real increase in output vs. how much results from inflation. The old system
tended to overemphasize growth in surging industries with falling prices,
primarily computers, thus ballooning the economy's overall growth rate.
   The new ``chain-weighted'' measures will reflect price changes more
quickly, resulting in less exaggeration of fast-growing sectors. So while
the old scale measured GDP growing at a respectable 2.8% in 1995, the
Commerce Dept. will probably report a 2% gain by the new measures--forcing
business and economists to recalibrate notions of what constitutes a
``weak'' or ``strong'' economy. BUSINESS WEEK uses the chain-weighted
system in this report.
GROWING SEASON. However you measure it, the 1996 economy will feature some
familiar trends, such as downsizing. Outplacement specialists Challenger
Gray & Christmas Inc. predict that corporate layoffs will total 420,000 in
1996, matching 1995's level. Payroll-shedding will be most common in
industries where the government's role, either as a purchaser or a
regulator, is shrinking: defense, aerospace, telecommunications, banking,
and utilities.
   Slash-and-burn alone, however, will no longer dominate strategy
sessions. ``Very few companies have created sustainable advantages through
shrinking,'' says Thomas J. Tierney, managing director of consultants Bain
& Co. More companies say they're focusing on growth strategies designed to
increase sales, boost market share, and expand overseas. In a September
survey of senior planning executives at 100 large U.S. corporations, 73%
said that boosting revenues would be more important than cutting costs over
the next three years, according to the Futures Group Inc., strategic
planning consultants. Only 18% of the executives surveyed emphasized
belt-tightening.
   One of the fastest routes to growth is acquisition. The 1995 merger boom
will keep rolling--whether it's telephone and media giants scrambling for
stronger positions in explosive communications markets or doctors banding
together for clout to deal with insurers. Defense contractors, electric
utilities, drugmakers, and banks are all feeling the heat. ``People realize
they need scale to compete--and it's easier to buy than to build,'' says
mergers and acquisitions expert Kim Fennebresque, managing director of
Union Bank of Switzerland. ``If you have scale, you can reduce costs.''
   Take Union Pacific Corp., awaiting government approval for its $3.9
billion purchase of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. Ronald J. Burns, CEO of
Union Pacific Railroad Co., figures the combined lines will reap nearly
$700 million a year in cost savings and increased revenues when the deal is
digested. With economies like that within reach, Securities Data Co.
expects 1996's M&A activity to top the record $442 billion in 1995 deals
reported as of Dec. 18.
   Internal investment will remain heavy, too. For some industries, even a
three-year boom in capital spending hasn't satisfied the need for more
production capacity: Semiconductor makers are scrambling to build enough
clean rooms to keep up with 20%-plus growth in chip demand. Even sectors
with plenty of new facilities must upgrade for global competition. ``When
you're in a harsh, competitive environment, you can't stop modernizing,''
says Roger E. Brinner, DRI chief economist. Pharmaceutical firms, which
boosted research spending by a relatively low 8% in 1995, plan to beef up
budgets in search of blockbuster drugs.
   Steel is an example of the modernization drive. Despite 1995's collapse
in prices, steelmakers are rushing to build minimills. While each new
minimill wreaks havoc on existing producers, cheaper production gives steel
an edge over other materials: Builders, for example, are using more steel
and less concrete. ``People say steel demand is inelastic,'' says Nucor
Corp. Chairman F. Kenneth Iverson. ``But when you drop the price, you
expand the market.''
   Many industries will be looking abroad to expand their markets in 1996.
``We're not planning on the U.S. economy to carry us in 1996,'' says Daniel
J. Meyer, CEO of Cincinnati Milacron Inc. Outfits such as Milacron looking
to expand sales abroad can count two strong pluses in 1996: American
industry is now ranked the world's most competitive, according to the
Swiss-based World Economic Forum. And America's top trading partners, after
a poor-to-disastrous 1995, see better economies ahead.
   The biggest surprise may be Japan. After a 33% surge in the Nikkei stock
index, coupled with the Bank of Japan's success at stabilizing the yen at
around 100 to the dollar, Tokyo pundits are hopeful that economic
stagnation will finally end after four flat years. Forecasters expect
Japan's GDP to grow by 1.2% or more in 1996, after inflation.
   That growth should open up possibilities for U.S. exporters. American
brands are increasingly popular in Tokyo's Ginza, where Gap Inc. recently
opened a store to push its low-key apparel. U.S. computer makers hold about
30% of Japan's $9 billion PC market, with Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM
expecting to reap even more sales from the recent rollout of a Japanese
version of Windows 95. Even American carmakers are pushing at the gates in
hopes of capitalizing on last summer's U.S.-Japan trade deal: Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. unveiled right-hand-drive models of the Taurus and
Neon at this fall's Tokyo auto show.
RECOVERING PESO. The other sick economy of 1995--Mexico--will also show
signs of health. Following last winter's peso crisis, the Mexican economy
has shrunk by at least 7%. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 9% in 1995, while
the cheap peso powered a sharp 30% rise in Mexican sales to El Norte. Now,
Mexico seems set for a slow recovery, with 1.5% to 2% growth in 1996
followed by 4% or more in 1997. That won't ignite a boom in U.S. export
sales, but pressure on the trade imbalance could ease if the peso gains
strength against the dollar.
   U.S. companies account for the bulk of the $6.3 billion in direct
investments in Mexico pledged for 1996. AT&T, MCI Communications, and Bell
Atlantic are spending heavily to prepare for the 1997 opening of
telecommunications. Privatization will spread to petrochemical plants and
railroads in 1996, and Mexico is encouraging foreigners to invest in
natural-gas distribution and power plants. U.S. corporations increasingly
see Mexico as an attractive production base for sales to the rest of Latin
America. ``We can tie together manufacturing in the U.S. and Mexico and go
after markets in South America,'' says Kenneth C. Brown, president of GE de
Mexico.
   Forecasters don't expect much help with the trade balance from Canada's
rebounding economy, which the Bank of Montreal predicts will grow 3.5% in
1996. With the weak Canadian dollar (trading at around U.S. 73 cents) and
with shaky Canadian consumers holding on to their wallets, Canada's
southbound exports may grow faster than the flow of goods northward. That
could push Canada's merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. to a record $27
billion in 1996, says Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Toronto brokerage
Nesbitt Burns.
   Europe may not do much for the U.S. trade balance in 1996, either. While
members of the European Union recently unveiled their proposed unified
currency, the Euro, the recent French strikes to protest budget-cutting in
Paris highlight the difficulty that EU members will have in meeting the
stringent fiscal requirements for monetary union. French forecasters expect
growth of only 1% in 1996. Germany is healthier, but business there is
struggling to remain competitive in the face of high wages and taxes.
``Europe still has the pain and agony of downsizing and restructuring ahead
of it,'' says Nariman Behravesh, DRI's chief international economist, who
predicts 2.3% growth for the EU in 1996.
   For fast growth, U.S. exporters will once again have to turn to Asia.
The economies of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Thailand will grow at rates between 5% and 9% in 1996, down just
slightly from 1995. Texas Instruments Inc., for instance, has an Asian
export winner in its high-end digital-signal processing chips, made in
America and sold for use in interactive toys, telecom gear, and video
devices. TI's Asian sales rose 50% in 1996, says Victor Koh, managing
director for Hong Kong and China, in part because Asians are buying more
electronics for their own use. ``We're benefiting from the higher affluence
in Asia,'' he says.
   Global crosscurrents will make 1996 the third strong year for American
exports, which should grow a further 9% after adjustment for inflation. At
the same time, subdued U.S. consumers may cut down on their purchases of
goods made abroad. So while the U.S. will still run a trade deficit, the
improved trade balance should add some $18 billion to GDP in 1996, says
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Inc., marking ``the first
time this decade that net exports have been a plus for U.S. growth rather
than a drag.''
BETTER THINGS TO DO. Export gains, continued capital spending, low
inflation, and falling interest rates--what could go wrong with this
picture? The biggest threat to the serene economy of 1996 may lie in
Washington. In their struggle over balancing the budget, President Clinton
and congressional Republicans have already shut down major portions of the
federal government twice and spooked the markets.
   Still, neither the White House nor Capitol Hill has much to gain from a
budget stalemate. For both sides, the best course is to strike a deal and
move on to matters closer to politicians' hearts--such as campaigning for
November's elections. If Washington's dragons and sea serpents will just
get out of the way, the U.S. economy could enjoy fair winds in 1996.

TEA LEAVES, ANYONE?

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

Once again, Up Front bravely predicts the future. We undertake this
foolhardy venture on the basis of what we know about the past. That often
can lead one astray, but it's the best we've got.
THE '96 ELECTION. It's Bill Clinton, the Comeback Kid, for four more years.
Vilified for much of his first term, he still will outshine his dour GOP
challenger, Bob Dole. Right-wing Republicans, uneasy about deal-cutter
Dole, will stay home. Ross Perot will mount a third-party foray and skim
off more GOP voters. Public dismay over Gingrichian harshness will give the
Dems back the House but not the Senate.
STOCK MARKET. Funny thing how the economy and the market usually go up in
an election year. Aided by lowering interest rates and ebbing inflation,
the Dow should rise moderately, to 5600, by Election Day. Nothing like
1995's performance, however, since that's hard to top.
INTEREST RATES. An eventual federal budget accord--neither party wants to
be accused of gridlock--should give the Federal Reserve all the ammo it
needs to lower rates some more. Look for the Fed, satisfied that inflation
is under control, to reduce the federal-funds rate by a half-point, to 5%,
by spring. Then it will lay off, so as not to get tangled up in electoral
politics.
MONETARY UNION. The much heralded European Monetary Union will be shelved
during a summit this summer. Other than Germany, no European country is
close to hitting fiscal targets set up by the Maastricht Treaty for a
single currency. These require cutting budget deficits and debt by 1997. As
the strikes in France show, the necessary austerity is not popular. Plus,
Europe's economies are weakening, which will make achieving the treaty's
goals even harder.
APPLE. Woebegone Apple Computer will sell off chunks of its business, since
no buyer wants the whole thing. Look for Oracle's Larry Ellison, Sun
Microsystems, or IBM to acquire software. Japan's Canon could be a buyer
for the hardware.
DISNEY. Mickey's run of smash animated films will end with this summer's
release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. While not a bust, this flick will
do nowhere near the box office of The Lion King blockbuster or even the
moderate hit Pocahontas. In a bid to lure boys and teens, Disney chose
Quasimodo's unlovely tale. This downbeat story, though, will turn off
traditional Disney fans. Plus, the movie has few of the soaring musical
numbers that punctuated earlier efforts.
CHRYSLER. A nasty proxy fight erupts as Kirk Kerkorian challenges Chrysler.
His goal is to name his lieutenant Jerome York to the board, launch a huge
stock buyback, and double the dividend. Result: CEO Robert Eaton fends off
the billionaire. Eaton shunts some of the company's $6.4 billion in spare
cash--which Kerkorian wanted to use for dividends and buybacks--into the
more productive pursuit of a joint venture with a foreign auto maker.
THE INTERNET. Net fever will cool off a notch or two. With scads of
companies already on the Net but profits scarce, new offerings will taper
off. Look for consolidation among the companies providing Net services.
Most likely winners: America Online, Netscape, Microsoft.

SMARTEST MOVES OF 1995

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

1. AT&T focused its energies on the booming telecom market by forging plans
to spin off its manufacturing arm and its problem-plagued computer unit
(the former NCR). The stock has soared since, wiping out all the NCR
losses.
2. Early investors in the Netscape public offering profited outrageously.
Since going public at 28 last summer, it topped 150 by early December.
3. Colin Powell adroitly managed his public persona with his book tour. By
then ruling out a Presidential bid, he avoids the mud of the 1996
primaries. So he's free to be crowned the GOP Vice-Presidential nominee.
4. Kirk Kerkorian advanced his battle to win more influence at Chrysler by
hiring its former CFO, Jerome York. York's baleful analyses of the
carmaker's finances grabbed investor attention.
5. Caterpillar hung tough and got the United Auto Workers to come back from
their 18-month strike, accepting terms they rejected at the outset.

DUMBEST MOVES OF 1995

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

1. Daiwa Bank let a U.S.-based trader run up $1.1 billion in losses. A key
regulator at Japan's Ministry of Finance knew about the mess but let it
slide.
2. Barings collapsed because it didn't know until too late that
Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson ran up $1.4 billion in losses.
3. Newt Gingrich's abrasiveness and vainglory blunted his message. Big
example: He said he favored shutting down the government in November partly
out of pique that Bill Clinton made him sit in the back of Air Force One.
4. Calvin Klein was forced to withdraw his jeans ads, which used teen
models in suggestive poses. Critics accused him of purveying kiddie porn.
5. ABC knuckled under to Philip Morris' $10 billion libel suit over a
program about cigarettes' nicotine content that contained one defensible
error.

FROM CHRISTMAS BLAHS TO NEW YEAR'S EASE

By:
BY JAMES C. COOPER & KATHLEEN MADIGAN

While Congress and the White House play their political games over the
budget, they seem oblivious to the dangers of testing the patience of the
financial markets. With so much anticipation for deficit reduction already
priced into the markets, Wall Street had better get some good news from
Washington fast, or another 102-point tumble in stock prices and a sharp
sell-off in bonds like those of Dec. 18 could be in the making.
   For now, at least, the markets have taken solace from elsewhere in
Washington: the Federal Reserve. The Fed's Dec. 19 quarter-point cut in
short-term interest rates has soothed the markets' edginess, not so much
because of that one snip but because it now looks as though more policy
easing is on the way.
   The strongest hint of that is the reason given by the Fed for its latest
cut. Chairman Alan Greenspan cited not a soft economy but inflation that
was ``somewhat more favorable than anticipated.'' More important, he noted
``an associated moderation in inflation expectations.'' The two-point drop
during the past year in long-term bond yields, which incorporate
anticipated inflation, bears that out.
   If such expectations are indeed down, the Fed cannot justify holding its
overnight federal funds rate nearly three full points above the rate of
inflation, in light of an historical average of only about 1 3/4%. What
Greenspan is saying is this: Against a more sanguine attitude toward future
inflation, real short-term rates are simply too high.
   Moreover, these expectations of lower inflation are not fleeting. They
are set to stay down amid continued modest economic growth, an eventual
budget deal, a stronger dollar, and a new order of technology-driven
competitiveness in Corporate America.

THE IMPACT of these structural forces is clear in the November consumer
price index, which was flat for the first time since the end of the last
recession in March, 1991. The core index, which excludes the volatile
energy and food sectors, rose a scant 0.1%.
   Through November, annual CPI inflation was running at 2.6%, the same as
in 1994, and it seems likely to have ended 1995 very near that pace. Back
in July, the Fed's own forecast projected that inflation for the year would
be much higher, between 3.1% and 3.4%.
   Even service inflation, widely anticipated to be the first area to
register a speedup, has remained modest, at about 3.4% for most of the
year. Meanwhile, goods inflation, at 1.5% in November, is hardly on the
radar (chart). However, that low rate is the result of deep discounting by
many retailers, which threatens their profits--and for some, their very
existence.
   Retailers' dreary little Christmas provides additional support for a
winter rate cut. Despite the expected last-minute surge, stores still
reported pretty dismal sales in December. Rampant price promotions to lure
shoppers subtracted from dollar revenues. The early winter weather in some
parts of the nation only added to the problem. The Johnson Redbook Report
said December sales at department and discount stores through Dec. 23 were
2.4% below November sales.
   Lifeless sales mean that yearend profits will be a disaster for many
retailers, and the consolidation process already wracking the industry will
accelerate. More chains, especially regional discounters and apparel
stores, are likely to seek bankruptcy protection.
   The resulting liquidations could well lead to further downward pressure
on goods prices. If so, an actual decline in the monthly CPI in any of the
coming months cannot be ruled out.
   This lack of price pressure should bolster the strong low-inflation
sentiment in the bond market. And given the Fed's statement on inflationary
expectations, low long-term rates will give the central bank even more room
for another rate cut.

DO THE RETAIL WOES mean that the economy is tanking? Not necessarily. Much
of the profits decline stemmed from price cutting, so sales on an
inflation-adjusted basis should look somewhat better. Also, consumer
confidence, while down slightly in December, remains at the level it has
held for most of 1995 (chart).
   Moreover, according to one top Fed official, the central bank is aware
that the reports from individual retailers do not match the data used to
calculate the Commerce Dept.'s retail sales figures. And those retail
numbers do not include service purchases, which have remained healthy in
recent months.
   But while consumer buying is not as dramatically weak as the dour
reports from retailers would suggest, demand will still be no better than
modest. One reason is that in early 1996 consumers will have to contend
with their holiday credit-card bills.

THE RESULT WILL BE continued pressure on industrial output and employment,
as businesses adjust their inventories to more desirable levels. That
scenario should translate into unexciting economic growth in the new
year--another reason the Fed will have room to ease policy further.
   In October, inventories held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers rose 0.6%, but sales tumbled 0.4%. During the past year, the
annual growth rates of both inventories and sales have been slowing, but
the pace of sales has slowed faster (chart).
   That disparity is the chief reason for the continued sluggishness in the
industrial sector. Industrial production in November rose a tepid 0.2%,
following a decline in October. Output for the fourth quarter is on track
to rise even more slowly than the lackluster 3.2% annual rate posted in the
third quarter.
   The international economic climate is also conducive to rate cutting.
Even before the Fed's Dec. 19 move, the British Treasury and the German
Bundesbank had trimmed rates in the face of slower economic growth. And
following the Fed, the Bank of Canada eased monetary policy as well.
   Other European central banks followed the German lead, as growth
throughout Europe appears to be slowing, leading most private forecasters
to cut their projections for 1996 European growth. Almost all
industrialized nations reported weak holiday sales.
   Consequently, the dollar should be able to maintain its recent trend of
appreciation against the German mark and the Japanese yen, even in the face
of further rate reductions by the Fed. The greenback will get some added
support when a budget deal rolls in from Washington--whenever that may take
place.
   That delay, however, will not hamstring monetary policy. In the recently
released minutes of the Fed's Nov. 15 meeting, the central bankers agreed
that the Fed ``could not freeze its policy options while it awaited the
outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate.''
   Now that Shutdown II has stretched to record length, the Fed's refusal
to be tied to the political wrangling means that economic and inflationary
forces will set the course of monetary policy in early 1996. And right now,
those forces point to further easing ahead.

A HARD-WON VICTORY IN A SOFT ECONOMY

By:
BY JAMES C. COOPER & KATHLEEN MADIGAN

After a dismal 1995, Argentina is poised for an expansionary 1996. And that
growth will pave the way for fiscal improvement and a stable currency.
   The latest sign that Argentina is coming out of recession came from the
Latin America Research Fund. The private agency reported that demand for
industrial goods rose again in November. Purchases have been increasing
since hitting a three-year low in August, with capital goods leading the
gain. In addition, in its semiannual survey the government said that the
unemployment rate slipped to 16.4% in October, from a record high of 18.4%
in May. However, only part of the drop is the result of job growth of
40,000 new slots. The rest came from workers dropping out of the labor
force.
   Argentina's economy likely fell by 2.5% in 1995, but the government is
forecasting growth of 5% in 1996. Private economists expect a more
realistic 3% advance this year. Economic growth should be fueled by lower
interest rates, a stronger peso--thanks to its link to the rising U.S.
dollar and low inflation--and inflows of foreign funds. Already, prospects
of better corporate profits have lifted the stock market in recent weeks.
   Economic growth will keep the markets rising. And it will help the
government balance the budget in 1996, after Argentina's $2.4 billion
deficit in 1995. To raise revenues, Congress hiked the cigarette tax by 7%
on Dec. 21.
   Argentina's slump was the result of an austerity program to fight
hyperinflation--a battle that has succeeded so far. Consumer prices were up
1.7% from a year ago in November (chart). Inflation is on track to rise
between 1.5% and 1.7% for 1995, the lowest rate on record. In 1989,
Argentine inflation ran at a stunning 5,000%.
   The International Monetary Fund has blessed Argentina's economic and
fiscal progress, saying it would lend Argentina $380 million this year.
That influx of funds--along with private money attracted by the rising
stock market--is added insurance that Argentina's economy will grow in
1996.

HERE COMES GRIDLOCK '96
Dug-in liberals and GOP zealots spell election-year paralysis

By:
By Richard S. Dunham, with Lee Walczak, in Washington

Citing irreconcilable differences with his Republican foes, President
Clinton vetoes appropriations bill after appropriations bill, leaving large
chunks of the government to run on fumes. A bitter budget impasse shutters
the federal bureaucracy for the longest stretch in history, forcing the
Treasury to resort to creative accounting to fund essential arms of
government. Voters increasingly dismiss the capital caterwauling as the
latest example of Washington's childishness. Actually, there's another way
to describe the capital's escalating political brawl: dress rehearsal.
   As the 1995 legislative season draws to a rancorous close with the fate
of a budget-balancing accord, welfare reform, and other key legislation
unresolved, the tone is being set for next year's policy struggles. In the
best of times, an election-year Congress can be expected to elevate
political theatrics over substance. But the ideological differences between
dug-in Democratic liberals, GOP hardliners, and a President obsessed by
reelection will ensure that next year's Congress--and any chance business
had for advancing the solid legislative gains of '95--will be stymied by
paralyzing political gamesmanship.
   Even as GOP and Administration budget negotiators warily convened for a
round of post-Christmas talks, the realization was growing that after
months of Republican dominance, Washington has once again become Gridlock
City. ``We're ready to kill each other already,'' laments a Democratic
leadership aide. ``It can't get any worse--can it?''
   Actually, it can, and it will. Bolstered by his success at using the
Medicare debate to paint Republicans as extremists, President Clinton plans
to continue his political jiu-jitsu in 1996. The new target: a GOP flat-tax
proposal that the Administration will cast as a boondoggle for wealthy
investors. Says a Clinton adviser: ``Medicare was just a dress rehearsal
for what Republicans are in for when Democrats start in on the `tax
giveaway for the rich.'''
HANGING TOUGH. If Clinton is spoiling for another fight along class lines,
he's sure to find one with a combative group of Hill conservatives who are
not letting House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plunging popularity cool their
fervor. The freshmen have hardened GOP resistance to a budget-balancing
accord and promise to make more trouble next year by redoubling attacks on
the welfare state.
   The hang-tough tactics ``haven't been marching orders from Newt
Gingrich,'' says rookie Representative Steve Largent (R-Okla.). ``We came
in here with our name on the dotted line.'' Adds freshman Representative
Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.): ``We've been called radical and extreme, but I think
we're right out of the heart of America.'' Still, business leaders worry
that the freshmen's all-or-nothing approach is overly antagonistic. ``The
war is worth fighting,'' says Amway President Dick DeVos. ``But it
shouldn't be done stupidly.''
   To appreciate just how complicated 1996's legislative equation will be,
take a short stroll across the Capitol from the foxholes of House GOP
guerrillas to the placid quarters of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. The
Republican front-runner will pursue his own agenda--and none of it includes
riling potential voters, Gingrich-style. Dole plans a light Senate schedule
for the first three months of '96, which will give him lots of time to wrap
up the nomination. Concedes one senior House staffer: ``All we're going to
get done around here is the minimum must-pass agenda.''
   Even a minimal Hill agenda could fall victim to gridlock. Aside from
monitoring preliminary hearings on radical simplification of the tax code,
business is keenest on winning regulatory relief from nuisance lawsuits,
environmental mandates, and overeager regulators who don't weigh the
potential economic impact of new rules. The outlook for sweeping change is
even gloomier. For starters, Dems will continue to score political points
by portraying GOP reformers as too cozy with polluters and overly beholden
to corporate benefactors. And House and Senate Republican moderates will
continue to line up with Dems against GOP radicals. The bottom line for
business: little progress in '96.
   On another front of interest to business lobbyists--political
reform--bipartisan attempts to limit the role of organized giving in
political campaigns seem likely to be thwarted by the leaders of both
parties. Newly triumphant Republican leaders are shaking the corporate
money tree hard and don't want to give up their advantage. Democrats,
meanwhile, remain hooked on reforms that include taxpayer subsidies
vehemently opposed by Republicans. The prospect: Look for superficial
reforms, at best, and torrents of pious rhetoric.
DEEP BELIEFS. GOP plans to dismantle New Deal social programs by returning
responsibility to the states will face tough sledding, too. Already, GOP
moderates have quashed reformers' efforts to turn food stamps and the
school lunch program into state-run block grants. And Clinton's attack on
GOP schemes to shift Medicaid to state capitals is just a preview of a '96
Democratic assault that charges Republicans aim to shred the social safety
net. The outlook: Although Clinton may yet cut a deal on a proposal to end
the federal guarantee of open-ended welfare benefits, other GOP
``devolution'' initiatives will languish.
   At bottom, deeply held partisan beliefs frame this running debate about
the role of government. But the tactics of the combatants are disturbing
the American electorate. In December, the Harris Poll's annual ``alienation
index'' hit a 30-year high. And an Associated Press poll released on Dec.
26 found that 29% of those surveyed said neither political party addresses
their top concerns. That's why the return of Washington gridlock will spur
demands for new political options--whether it's Ross Perot's infant Reform
Party or another movement.
   ``People are concerned by all the posturing and shifting of blame,''
says New Hampshire pollster Richard Bennett. ``All politicians are going to
pay the price.'' Perhaps. But until a resurgent Bill Clinton, unrepentant
Gingrichites, and comeback-minded Democratic liberals pause to assess the
long-term costs of their scorched-earth tactics, don't look for any break
from gridlock politics. All sides are having too much fun gumming up the
gears of the American political machinery to stop now.



If you liked the partisan battles of '95, you'll love what's in store for
'96

TAX REFORM
Expect early skirmishing over GOP plans to overhaul taxes. Republicans will
push competing plans for a flatter income tax. The Democrats want reform
that retains progressive tax rates and closes corporate loopholes.

REG-SLASHING
Republicans will renew calls for legislation that gives companies relief
from lawsuits and environmental mandates. The Democrats, allied with
Republican moderates, will again attack reform proposals as extreme.

WELFARE REFORM
Clinton's likely veto of the GOP welfare bill will send everyone back to
the table. In '96, Republicans hope to cast Clinton as a defender of
welfare deadbeats. Democrats will hold out for better work incentives and a
safety net for mothers.

POWER TO THE STATES
Republicans who failed in '95 to end entitlements for food stamps and other
programs will try to shift the programs to states. Democrats will argue
that states lack the resources to fund income-support plans during economic
downturns.

THE RIGHT'S AGENDA
Under heavy pressure from conservative freshmen, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich will allow votes on new abortion restrictions and a repeal of the
assault-weapons ban. Democrats will try to thwart both measures.

THE ECONOMY THAT FELL TO EARTH
Germany's slowdown is scaring its neighbors

By:
By John Templeman in Bonn, with Heidi Dawley in London, Silvia Sansoni in
Rome, and bureau reports


Germany is supposed to be Europe's locomotive. But thanks in part to recent
French strikes holding up shipments of German goods, gross domestic product
probably will show no growth in the fourth quarter, the second stagnant
quarter in a row. Unemployment, rising since last spring, is now at 9.3%.
Exports are weakening. Capital spending is slumping. And corporate profits
are falling. Says Ian Harwood, head of strategy and economics at London's
Kleinwort Benson Group PLC: ``Fears of a hard landing are growing.''
   Indeed, while a tax cut, a recent Bundesbank interest-rate reduction,
and a widely expected decline in the German mark may produce a brief
rebound in the first half, the year ahead looks grim. Unless consumers
unzip their pocketbooks in a hurry--and that looks doubtful--Germany will
have a hard time even reaching the anemic 2% growth rate it achieved in
1995 (chart).
   Such downbeat forecasts scare Germany's neighbors. ``If Germany slows
down, everyone else winds down with it,'' says Sergio De Nardis, senior
economist at Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' federation. That
could spell the end of Europe's grand plans for a single currency and
monetary union by the start of 1999. European Union nations, led by France
(box), already are struggling to cut budget deficits and cap government
debt levels to bring them in line with the Maastricht Treaty. But a serious
growth setback starting from Germany would lower tax revenues, raise
government borrowing, and bloat deficits across the EU, putting monetary
union out of reach and blowing further European unification out of the
water.
   To a great degree, Germans have themselves to blame for their
predicament. Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt blames the current slowdown
on a high mark, big wage hikes, and rising taxes. Add overregulation of
business and rigid work rules, and it's no surprise that German companies
made some $26 billion in direct investments outside the country in the
first nine months of 1995, double the 1994 rate. The money is flowing to
Eastern Europe, Asia, and even Britain, whose manufacturing costs are 40%
lower than Germany's.
   The huge gap prompted Siemens, for example, to choose Britain as the
site for a $1.7 billion semiconductor plant. Consumer-products maker
Procter & Gamble Co., meanwhile, has stopped making new investments in
Germany. Its high business costs, warns Harald Einsmann, P&G regional
president, risk turning the country into the ``hole in the doughnut'' in
Europe's industrial landscape.
   As manufacturers rethink their commitment to Germany, hollowing out is
becoming a growth business. Two-thirds of management consultant McKinsey &
Co.'s German trade now consists of helping manufacturers expand production
in other parts of the world. Says Senior Partner Herbert Henzler:
``Germany's present export model--design it, make it, and export it from
here--is no longer viable.''
WARY CONSUMERS. With more companies adopting that mantra, workforce cuts
will continue. Germany has already lost 1 million jobs since 1992, mostly
in manufacturing. But employers' organizations warn that another 500,000 to
1 million jobs are at risk unless wage costs, particularly welfare taxes,
fall. Little wonder that in one recent poll, two-thirds of eastern
Germans--and half of those in the west--told the Allensbach-based
Demoskopie Institut that the risk of losing their jobs is now their biggest
worry.
   That's bad news for policymakers who are counting on a revival of
consumer demand. Many expect further Bundesbank rate cuts, and an $11
billion income tax reduction kicks in on Jan. 1. Will that money find its
way into stores? Some analysts are skeptical, noting that after months of
belt-tightening to pay higher taxes, many consumers aren't about to loosen
up with the economy slowing. ``We went without so much this year, that we
might consider spending [the tax rebate],'' says Gabi Lewin, a mother of
two whose husband works in an accountant's office. ``But if things get
worse over the short term, we might just sock it away and wait.''
   Reflecting that caution, retail sales fell 2.5% in 1995, the third
straight decline, and a hoped-for late spurt in Christmas buying failed to
materialize. And forget about 1996. Walter Deuss, chief executive officer
of the Karstadt department-store chain, notes that recent surveys ``don't
point to any durable improvement in consumer confidence.''
   While Germany waits for consumer spending to revive, the economy
continues to flag. If the U.S. is any guide, German restructuring efforts
could start bearing fruit around the time the EU plans to get its monetary
union into motion. That could leave Germany stronger and more competitive
than ever. Until then, expect anxiety levels to keep rising--in Germany and
across Europe.

NOW JUPPE HAS TO PICK UP THE PIECES

By:
By Bill Javetski in Paris


As Paris buses and subways began running again in late December after
France's worst strikes in three decades, drivers and token-booth clerks
cheerfully welcomed commuters back by letting them ride free of charge. It
was a smart public-relations move--but it was also unauthorized, showing
just how feisty France's public-sector unions are feeling after paralyzing
the country for 24 days. In forcing Prime Minister Alain Juppe to back away
from several key reforms, labor leaders have set the stage for a perilous
New Year as France tries to curb spending, revive growth, and prepare for
monetary union. Without a strong government in charge, achieving any of
those goals may be impossible.
   It is true that Juppe did not lose everything in his struggle with the
unions. In late December, a ``social summit'' with labor and industry left
intact a core plan to eliminate France's $12 billion health-care deficit.
But the realization is sinking in that ``Juppe is storing up problems for
the future,'' figures Christopher Potts, economist at Paris brokerage
Chevreux De Virieu.
BATTERED ECONOMY. For starters, Juppe's health-care plan probably marks the
limits of the reforms that his government will achieve. Tackling the costs
of France's civil service now seems impossible, since to end the strikes,
Juppe caved on the key points of reforming the loss-ridden national
railroad and aligning public-sector pensions with more restrictive
private-sector ones. And with his autocratic style, Juppe has failed to
build any kind of consensus for further cuts, even though government
spending is fast pushing up debt levels to dangerous heights (chart).
   Yet Germany, France's key European partner, is insisting on even deeper
French budgetary austerity for a possible monetary union. For a single
currency to work, France must meet the German demands. Even a vigorous
economic upturn won't be enough to keep Juppe from needing additional
spending cuts to shrink the deficit from its current 5% of gross domestic
product to 3% by the end of 1997. That's when France and other aspiring
candidates must prove they qualify for the currency union.
   France's economy enters 1996 badly battered from the strikes, which may
resume at the end of January. Estimates of the strikes' costs in lost
economic activity range as high as $4 billion. The crippling job action,
which dried up holiday shopping, put some 50,000 small businesses at risk
of failing, according to Conseil National du Patronat Francais, the French
employers' association. ``We're in recession now, and we'll enter 1996
slowing down further,'' says CNPF Vice-President Denis Kessler.
Unemployment, which recently began rising again, will top 12% by June, the
national statistics office estimates. Morgan Stanley Group Inc. economist
Eric Chaney sees France's economy growing just 1.3% next year. For 1997,
the critical year for picking nations that will be eligible for monetary
union, he sees France's budget deficit hovering above 4%, a full percentage
point off the target.
THIN GRUEL.. Boxed in by the unions, Juppe hopes to stimulate moribund
consumer activity by granting tax breaks to investors selling stakes in
money-market funds. To tackle 20% youth unemployment, he is looking to
persuade companies to fill half their job vacancies with people under the
age of 25. And he is calling on business and labor to speed up negotiations
over part-time work and other ways to make French industry more flexible.
   But that's thin gruel considering France's budgetary plight. The strikes
may be over for now. But their repercussions on France and all of Europe
will be felt through 1996 and beyond.

FROM BLUEPRINTS TO GRAND DESIGN
Ex-engineer John Correnti now must recast Nucor

By:
By Stephen Baker in Pittsburgh


As a young engineer, John D. Correnti built factories for a living. The job
kept him moving about as often as a traveling salesman. He built blast
furnaces in Ohio, a tire-cord factory in Georgia, a uranium plant in Texas.
He was usually hundreds of miles away, he now jokes, by the time any
glitches appeared. In 1983, Correnti was finishing up a steel mill in Utah
for Nucor Corp. when he got a surprise phone call from Chairman F. Kenneth
Iverson ordering him to run the plant. Correnti was stunned. ``You didn't
tell me I'd have to live with my mistakes,'' he protested.
   Iverson just called Correnti again--and this time he's turning the whole
shebang over to him. On Jan. 1, the 48-year-old executive will take over as
CEO of the Charlotte (N.C.) minimill giant, which is poised to pass
Bethlehem Steel Corp. as the second-biggest steel company in America,
trailing only the U.S. Steel Group of USX Corp. The transition shouldn't be
bumpy for the compact, silver-templed Correnti: Since 1991, he has been
Nucor's chief operating officer. What's more, Iverson is sticking around as
chairman. Still, taking over for a CEO who led Nucor to 30 years of strong
sales growth and solid profits is daunting. ``He's an icon,'' Correnti
says.
ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED. Correnti's promotion comes at a trying time for Nucor.
For a decade, it has been the high-flying Wal-Mart of the steel industry,
keeping costs down on basic products and passing the savings on to
customers. But as imitators spring up, also offering cheap, basic steel,
Nucor finds itself under pressure to revamp its product mix and get into
higher-margin steels. Meanwhile, it's still struggling with new technology
at its iron carbide plant in Trinidad. Worried investors have traded the
stock down to about $54, vs. last year's high of $72.
   Correnti admits Nucor has some adjusting to do. To compete in premium
markets, it must improve product quality. Customers in those markets, such
as auto and appliance makers, also demand lots of customized attention, a
specialty of the integrated steel companies.
   Yet Correnti takes over a strong, nearly debt-free company. As new
challengers grapple with startups in Kentucky and Indiana, Nucor already is
experimenting with making upscale stainless steel and ultrathin gauges in
its Indiana and Arkansas plants. Plus, it's busy building a third
flat-rolled steel mill, a $500 million behemoth in South Carolina. Correnti
expects Nucor's sales this year to jump 13%, to $3.35 billion, and earnings
to top 1994's record $227 million. He's looking for 15% to 20% sales growth
for the next five years. Even if Nucor stumbles, it likely will eclipse
U.S. Steel as the No.1 steelmaker by the year 2000. ``After South Carolina,
it would just take one more mill,'' he says.
FRIEND OF BILL. The question is whether Nucor under Correnti can stay
nimble. He says he will keep the 22-person headquarters small and continue
delegating great powers to the plant managers. His job? To oversee new
projects, stay in touch with Wall Street, and visit the 19 divisions two or
three times a year. Except for all the flying time--spent reading mystery
novels--Nucor's rapid growth rate won't be much of a drain on its CEO, he
says; ``What's the difference between 15 divisions and 30 divisions? It's
just a few more lines on the page.''
   Correnti is regarded as harder-driving than the genial Iverson, and he
preens a bit more in the limelight. He made friends with then-Governor Bill
Clinton when the company was negotiating plant sites in Arkansas. And he
continues to meet with Clinton, talking steel and politics at the White
House--or, more recently, chatting at a Little Rock banquet for retiring
Democratic Senator David H. Pryor. ``I'm one of the Republican Friends of
Bill,'' he says.
   He's also quicker than Iverson to make enemies. Speaking at Robert
Morris College in Pittsburgh, Correnti bulled into a subject most
executives sidestep, saying matter-of-factly that he would ``never dream of
building a mill'' in a union town like Pittsburgh. But as competition heats
up for Nucor, Correnti's combative ways might be just what the company
needs.

SHE IS THE NRA
Its first female chief is out to oust Clinton and lure women

By:
By Paul Magnusson in Washington


Marion P. Hammer was working late one night in Tallahassee when a carload
of thugs followed her into a parking garage and threatened her. ``I reached
into my purse, pulled out my gun, brought it up through the headlights, and
aimed right at the driver,'' she recalls. ``He put it in reverse, the tires
started smoking, and they were gone.''
   That was a decade ago, when Hammer was lobbying the Florida legislature
to relax restrictions on handguns. Her success there helped kick off a
28-state movement to ease restrictions on carrying concealed weapons. In
December, her record as a winning lobbyist and hard-line opponent of gun
control helped her become the first female president of the 3.3
million-member National Rifle Assn. after her predecessor, Thomas L.
Washington, died of a heart attack. Hammer, who had been vice-president, is
expected to run unopposed in April for a one-year term of her own.
   Now, the 56-year-old Hammer has her adversaries firmly in her sights.
She wants Congress to overturn the federal assault weapons ban.
``Restrictions on gun ownership are just a form of harassment,'' she says.
Next up is the defeat of pro-gun-control politicians--starting with the
President. ``The one thing we definitely plan to do is to work to beat Bill
Clinton,'' says Hammer.
   Hammer's confrontational style may be just right for today's embattled
NRA, which has image and money problems, has recently lost 200,000 members,
and is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly
commingling funds. To boost membership again, Hammer plans to step up the
NRA's appeal to women and families using two time-honored NRA programs: the
``Refuse to be a Victim'' educational campaign for women, emphasizing crime
prevention and self-defense while promoting gun ownership; and the ``Eddie
Eagle'' gun-safety campaign for children, which is Hammer's personal
creation.
``WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.'' Under Hammer, the NRA won't neglect politics at the
statehouse either. She spent 20 years lobbying in Florida on behalf of gun
owners and proudly points to Florida's first concealed-weapons permit,
which allows her to pack her .38 caliber Colt Detective Special or her 9-mm
Beretta semiautomatic. ``During the past three years, the NRA has been
wildly successful in the states, and Hammer is the poster child for the
conceal-and-carry issue,'' laments Josh Sugarmann, director of the Violence
Policy Center, a gun-control group.
   Hammer, a grandmother of three, likes to unwind at the target range
after a day of hard lobbying. On the range or at the office, her opponents
say, she seldom misses her mark.

TELECOM: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WALLS FALL
Once reform passes, a frenzy of pair-ups is sure to follow

By:
By Joseph Weber in Philadelphia, with John Carey in Washington


They might as well be ringing a starting bell on the Capitol steps.
Washington's long revamp of telecommunications law is just about finished.
The message most telecom companies hear ringing loud and clear: Let the
deals begin.
   On Dec. 20, House and Senate conferees finally hammered out a compromise
that would allow Baby Bells, cable-TV operators, and long-distance
companies to invade one another's turf. It would also permit companies to
own more radio and TV stations than is now permitted. Thorny details, such
as how much to relax curbs on foreign ownership of U.S. companies, remain
to be determined. But says Representative Rick Boucher (D-Va.): ``All the
core issues have been settled. This will be landmark legislation.''
   Once the bill is passed, probably by early 1996, a swarm of mergers,
alliances, and joint ventures seems inevitable. That's because most of the
rigid regulatory barriers between segments of the industry will be gone.
Now, says Robert Barada, chief strategist for San Francisco-based Baby Bell
Pacific Telesis Group: ``Technology and customer demand are going to break
down the walls.''
``LOOKING.'' Which companies are likely to pair up? Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Nynex Corp. may be among the first, either through a complete merger
or--more probable--a joint venture on long-distance service. Bell Atlantic
CEO Raymond W. Smith and Nynex chief Ivan Seidenberg already have joint
ventures going to provide cellular phone service and, with PacTel, develop
programming for cable TV. Indeed, a Bell Atlantic spokesman calls a
long-distance joint venture with Nynex ``a real option.'' Adds Nynex
Telecom Group President Richard A. Jalkut: ``We are looking at all possible
combinations.''
   Teaming up to challenge AT&T, MCI Communications, and Sprint in the
long-distance market would make good business sense for the two Northeast
Baby Bells. The Bell Atlantic and Nynex regions account for $20.5 billion
of the nation's annual $73 billion long-distance bill (charts). A merger
would give the two Bells the marketing and technical firepower needed to
compete for customers. Just pooling their ad budgets--Bell Atlantic alone
spends about $105 million yearly on all advertising--would challenge the $1
billion the Big Three long-distance carriers spend promoting their phone
services.
   Who's next? Analysts expect each Baby Bell to eventually link up with at
least one other. Among the predicted pairings: Pactel and US West, San
Antonio-based SBC Communications and BellSouth, and, perhaps, Chicago-based
Ameritech with Bell Atlantic and Nynex. GTE Corp., with phone lines
scattered around the country, is expected to find allies, too. Among other
things, partnerships would help the Bells better tap international markets.
Team-ups of Southern Baby Bells, for instance, could move into Latin
America, while Western outfits could target the Pacific Rim.
CULTURE CLASH. Long-distance providers, too, should find dealmaking
irresistible. Pacts with the Baby Bells would eliminate the need to
duplicate local networks while providing potent marketing partners.
Analysts say MCI Communications Corp. is a natural ally for a Bell
Atlantic-Nynex team, for instance. But long-distance carriers are looking
further afield as well. Since late 1994, Sprint Corp. and cable operators
Tele-Communications, Cox Cable, and Comcast have been exploring ways to
leverage phone and cable-TV operations into advanced communications
systems. One caveat: A couple of years ago, Bell Atlantic sought to merge
with TCI in a failed deal that confirmed Smith's empire-building
aspirations. That failure showed how tough it can be to join the go-go
cable world with the more conservative Bells.
   Another caveat: Analysts figure AT&T will probably avoid cutting deals
with Baby Bells because it won't want to be accused of recreating Ma Bell.
It may team up instead with, say, Time Warner Inc.--already a rumored
negotiating partner--to use cable lines for local phone service. That would
dramatically blur the old lines between segments of the telecom
industry--and set the stage for even more radical change. The deals to come
will be ``complex, multifaceted, multidimensional things,'' says Tony
Ferrugia, a telecom analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   In the end, the rewired telecom biz probably will include far fewer
players who will deliver better service and offer bold innovations. Ma Bell
won't exactly be coming back together after 12 years, but some of her
offspring almost certainly will.

ALL TOGETHER NOW: `MAKE THAT TO GO'
Insatiable demand for convenient, ready-to-eat meals has the food biz
scrambling

By:
By Greg Burns in Chicago


Boston Chicken Inc. didn't expect much when it tested ready-made holiday
meals this past Thanksgiving. But customers flocked in, gobbling down
hundreds of roast turkeys with all the fixin's. Why? ``People don't even
have time to cook Thanksgiving turkey dinner,'' says Saad J. Nadhir,
co-chairman of the take-out chain.
   In 1996, the nation's $900 billion food industry will be at the mercy of
customers who don't have time. Shoppers who can barely steal a few moments
to shop--let alone whip up home-cooked feasts--will set the pace of growth
for food processors, retailers, and food-service chains. The edge will go
to big, dominant companies that can use marketing clout to expand ``share
of stomach'' at the expense of weaker competitors. Other winners will be
innovators of all sizes that find new ways to ease the hunger pangs of a
harried populace.
   Inevitably, the time squeeze on shoppers will create losers, too,
especially among traditional full-line supermarkets. Their strong cash
flows give them enviable staying power, so an immediate shakeout is
unlikely. But erosion will continue as supermarkets face off against
up-and-comers such as Nadhir, who estimates that half the customers at his
fast-growing Boston Chicken chain would otherwise have cooked at home.
``You have too many retailers competing for too few food dollars and
appealing to consumers who have less time to deal with it,'' says
consultant Neil Z. Stern of Chicago's McMillan & Doolittle.
IDLE OVENS. Food processors and restaurant chains will see 5% to 6% revenue
growth in 1996, Stern estimates. Supermarkets will eke out 2% to 3% growth,
barely even with inflation. As U.S. households prepare fewer meals at home,
the percentage of food dollars spent at food retail stores--as opposed to
restaurants, cafeterias, convenience stores, and the like--will dip to 48%
in '96 from 55% a decade ago (chart). ``It's a great threat to
supermarkets,'' warns John H. Bryan, chief executive officer for Sara Lee
Corp.
   Consumers clamoring for ready-to-eat meals have made deli sales the one
supermarket bright spot. Supermarket chains such as Byerly's in Edina,
Minn., and Dominick's Finer Foods in Northlake, Ill., have pioneered new
in-store formats. In '96, expanded deli departments will attract at least 8
cents of each food dollar, up from 4 cents in 1986. And watch for more
supermarkets to introduce mall-style food courts featuring proven operators
such as McDonald's Corp., which is testing outlets at a Farmer Jacks
supermarket in Michigan and a Kroger in Tennessee. Food processors will
join in, too: Sara Lee has 17 sandwich shops serving its premium deli meats
inside Kroger supermarkets in Texas and Ohio.
   Among restaurant chains, cost control will be crucial. McDonald's has
cut the cost of opening a new restaurant by 30% over the past five years
through standardization and more reliance on drive-thru layouts. That has
helped McDonald's step up its U.S. growth fivefold, including joint
ventures that have put Golden Arches in Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depots,
Incredible Universe home-electronics stores, and Amoco gas stations.
FAR AND AWAY. With so many more outlets at hand, busy shoppers visit more
often, leaving less on the plate for the competition. Says McDonald's
Vice-Chairman Jack M. Greenberg: ``If you can dominate a trading area, it's
much more difficult and expensive for competitors to take customers away
from you.''
   Dominance matters to food processors, too. They're struggling to
increase scale and efficiency to satisfy the likes of supercenters, which
combine cut-rate supermarkets and discount stores under one roof. Food
processors also hope to give their ho-hum U.S. results a boost by pursuing
fast-growth markets overseas. And sharp operators such as H.J. Heinz, CPC
International, Campbell Soup, and others will be trying to lock in
relationships with fast-growing food-service operators. ``Everybody has the
same three strategies--lower domestic costs, grow internationally, and push
into food service,'' says analyst John M. McMillin at Prudential Securities
Inc.
   With all hands reaching for the same brass ring, the strongest brands
rule. As in 1995, industry players will sell off weak units to more
dominant competitors and buy businesses that enhance existing strengths.
The goal? Be No.1. ``I'm not even sure being No.2 is enough anymore,''
McMillin says. For investors, the message is clear: In the scrap over
``share of stomach,'' bet on the top dogs.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- With more consumers eating on the run, companies emphasizing
convenience will find eager customers.
   -- Food-service operators will grow by opening outlets in stores,
supermarkets, and gas stations.

Negatives
   -- Value-conscious shoppers will resist price increases.
   -- Supermarkets will continue to lose ``share of stomach'' to sharper
food-service operators, such as Boston Chicken.

MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER REARRANGERS
Deregulation will transform the industry--and continue to pinch profits

By:
By Mark Maremont in Boston


`Exciting, intense, and fun'': That's how a prominent electric-utility
executive describes his job these days. Surprised? If you thought
electricity was about as thrilling as dentistry, look again. A
three-year-old drive toward deregulation is causing new upheavals, from
cut-rate pricing to an unprecedented surge in mergers.
   On the regulatory front, the action in 1996 is likely to get a jump
start from an innovative plan approved by California's Public Utilities
Commission at the end of 1995. The plan, subject to change, would let some
customers shop for electricity from rival suppliers starting in 1998. The
long-awaited decision is another sign that the economic and political
forces propelling deregulation are too powerful to halt. Even American
Electric Power Co., the nation's second-largest investor-owned utility--and
at one time a staunch opponent of competition--proposed its own
far-reaching deregulation plan in 1995. Rather than fight the tide, says
Charles A. Falcone, an AEP senior vice-president, ``we have decided we want
to help shape the industry's new structure.''
SMOOTH SHIFT. AEP and other utilities had little choice. Profits will be
boosted or ravaged for years depending on how the industry and regulators
resolve some vexing questions. One big one is how far competition should
go. The most radical approach would let customers choose an electricity
supplier just as they choose a long-distance phone carrier, with power
flowing over still regulated lines maintained by the local utility. A more
moderate approach would retain today's basic structure but require
utilities to set rates based on prices in a wholesale power pool, which
proponents say would cut down on confusion. Muddying the waters, California
regulators decided to let both approaches coexist.
   Then there's the issue of the billions of dollars in uneconomical power
plants and long-term power contracts on the books of many utilities. These
will become millstones in a world where the cheapest power suppliers will
prevail. Big customers and some low-cost utilities contend that overly
expensive power plants and contracts should be written off, forcing
shareholders to bear the brunt of utilities' past poor decisions. But most
utilities argue that their costs are largely a legacy of poor regulations,
so customers should continue to foot the bill for a period. Allowing
customers to disregard their obligations ``is like asking your bank to let
you walk away from half your mortgage just because you want a new house,''
argues Thomas J. May, CEO of Boston Edison Co.
READY TO BID. More states will grapple with these and other contentious
issues in 1996, starting with Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Meanwhile,
utilities are shedding costs and their monopolistic mind-sets. Boston
Edison dumped one-fifth of its managers in 1995 and tried to spur new
thinking by reassigning most of those remaining to new jobs. WPL Holdings
Inc., a low-cost Wisconsin utility, has offered to show rivals' big
customers how much they could save by switching to WPL. It can't wrest away
the customers now, but it hopes to have the chance soon. ``Nobody owns
customers,'' says Erroll B. Davis Jr., WPL's aggressive CEO.
   Despite cost-cutting, profit margins aren't likely to improve much after
a five-year slide. Why? To stop defections, many utilities are cutting
prices to big customers 10% to 40% in return for long-term commitments.
Average aftertax profit margins declined to 17.2% in 1995, from 18.9% in
1991, says Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Moreover, some high-cost utilities are carrying artificial assets on
their books, such as payments due from customers over the next 20 to 30
years. If deregulation proceeds far enough, utilities may have to switch to
industrial accounting standards that don't recognize such assets. The
resulting megawrite-offs ``could get very ugly,'' says analyst Scotto, who
cites Centerior Energy Corp. as a prime candidate. Some utilities could be
forced into a restructuring or even bankruptcy.
   Also on tap for 1996 are more dividend cuts by an industry where
dividends once provided almost the only investment appeal. And mergers,
which reached a record $11.9 billion in 1995, are likely to keep surging,
especially if stock prices start to plummet as competition takes hold. No
question about it: The electric-utility industry isn't boring anymore.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Low interest rates have lightened debt loads.
   -- Delay in deregulation is allowing utilities more time to prepare.
   -- Demand for power is rising, and capacity is ample, so there's no need
for costly construction.

Negatives
   -- Demands by big customers for lower prices are hurting margins.
   -- High-cost utilities face a bleak future in
   -- deregulated world.

WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T FIND GOOD HELP?
Business-service firms boom as companies around the globe retool

By:
By Richard A. Melcher in Chicago


On some recent continent-hopping business trips, George T. Shaheen,
managing partner for Andersen Consulting, became thoroughly convinced that
change knows no boundaries. The rage in China was all about restructuring
and developing new markets. A Brazilian TV company was worried about how to
compete in foreign countries. ``It doesn't matter where you're doing
business,'' says Shaheen, ``everyone is going through a massive
retooling.'' While that may be wrenching to many, for Andersen and other
providers of business services, upheaval is a boon.
   Business services--a new category in BUSINESS WEEK's Industry
Outlook--encompasses legal services, advertising, personnel supply,
research and consulting, accounting, engineering, architecture, and
miscellaneous others, such as equipment rental and leasing. While their
growth rates vary, all of these industries to some degree cash in on the
continuing global trend toward seeking outside help. In 1996, predicts
DRI/McGraw-Hill, business services will grow 3.5% after inflation, to $806
billion in 1995 dollars.
   Consultants such as $4 billion Andersen should do far better than that.
Andersen, which specializes in providing advice on systems and so-called
change management, expects business to rise 20% for a second year and to
add as many as 8,000 people to its workforce of 37,000. Meantime, Bain &
Co. figures its business will jump 30% this year on the back of its
``growth'' consulting, which advises once shrinking clients how to grab
market share and find new customers overseas.
TEMP FEVER. Business-service providers will take on jobs of increasing
sophistication. Corporate layoffs will remain in the range of last year's
420,000 or so, figures outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, so
companies will continue to off-load everything from public relations to
computer services. That will ensure a fourth year of strong growth for the
temporary-help sector, which the National Association of Temporary &
Staffing Services estimates has annual revenues of $40 billion (chart).
``Temporary help used to be for emergency needs,'' says Manpower
International Inc. Chairman Mitchell S. Fromstein. ``Now, it's part of a
company's ongoing workforce strategy.'' Fromstein expects Manpower revenues
to be up some 15%--even higher than the industry's healthy 9% rise.
   At Manpower, as at scores of other companies, growth is being fueled by
demands for special skills. Today, Manpower is supplying computer
programmers and systems integrators as well as clerical workers.
Industrial-design specialists such as Boston's Design Continuum Inc. are
working with clients from research to final production. In advertising,
efforts to commercialize the Internet are providing golden opportunities
for nimble upstarts. ``The Internet will pose a major challenge for the big
agencies,'' says analyst James D. Dougherty of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
WORK, WORK. Generally, though, size seems to be an advantage. As industries
consolidate, companies turn to providers that can handle business globally.
In the advertising business, where growth is expected to be nearly 8%
thanks to election and Olympics spending, ``it's increasingly difficult for
midsize [advertising] agencies to compete,'' says Rochelle Lazarus, CEO of
giant Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide Inc.
   So look for the fragmented business-services sector to spawn plenty of
mergers. Last year, EDS Corp. purchased A.T. Kearney for $600 million,
marrying computer systems and engineering knowhow. This year, law firms are
ripe for combination, says consultant Bradford W. Hildebrandt. While law
firms are recovering from the depressed early '90s, Hildebrandt expects
revenues to rise 10% in 1996, so regional, national, and even international
mergers should be on the uptick. ``We'll see global consolidation like we
began seeing in accounting 10 years ago,'' predicts Hildebrandt.
   Other forces driving the mergers: difficulty in finding top
professionals and pricing pressure from customers. More and more companies
are demanding fixed fees from law firms. The outplacement industry has seen
commissions on large contracts drop from as much as 17% per individual to
about 10%, according to John A. Challenger. Yet across most of the growing
services sector, ``the No.1 risk and temptation'' is to take on more work
than firms have the ability to handle, say Bain's worldwide managing
director, Thomas J. Tierney. For now, that's a hurdle most service
providers are eager to attempt.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Continued industry restructuring favors a variety of services, from
temporary help to consulting and engineering.
   -- Booming economies in Asia and other markets offer new work to U.S.
architects, engineers, and advertisers.

Negatives
   -- A shortage of quality staff looms as businesses demand more
sophisticated services.
   -- Consolidation among clients adds price pressures and kills smaller or
less specialized firms.

WILL WALL STREET HIT A WALL?
It will be tough to match '95, but low rates could keep the market robust

By:
By Leah Nathans Spiro in New York


Wall Street should get another gift from the Federal Reserve in 1996:
continued low interest rates. DRI/McGraw-Hill predicts that 30-year
Treasury bonds will end the year at 6.26%, up just a tad from 6% at yearend
1995. Rock-bottom rates mean another super year for the securities
industry, since investors will keep deserting bank certificates of deposits
to seek higher returns in the stock market, boosting the market and Wall
Street commissions. ``From everything we see, it's going to be another good
year,'' declares John J. Mack, president of Morgan Stanley & Co.
   After a slow start, 1995 blossomed into a very good year for the
securities industry. New York Stock Exchange firms reaped an estimated $6.5
billion in pretax profits. That's the second-best year ever after 1993's
$8.6 billion blow-out. Fueling the industry was record stock-market volume,
thanks to a Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that soared 37% and strong
underwriting and mutual-fund sales.
   For 1996, the BUSINESS WEEK profit estimate is just $5.5 billion,
though. That's because it would be tough for rates to decline in 1996 as
much as they did in 1995, when they fell from 8% to about 6%. Declining
rates are Wall Street's dream environment, since they boost corporate
refinancing as well as the stock market.
TAKEOVER RUMORS. The new year is starting off with lots of momentum.
Mergers and acquisitions were red-hot in 1995, racking up $450 billion in
deals, topping the previous record of $355 billion in 1994, according to
Securities Data Co. ``There is no reason to believe the robust M&A market
won't continue,'' says Kim Fennebresque, a managing director at UBS
Securities Inc. Initial public offerings were another winner, with an
estimated $29 billion in new issues in 1995, almost reaching the 1993
record of $34 billion.
   Wall Street is notoriously cyclical, though, so the gold rush could slow
in '96. The stock market is unlikely to sustain its record performance for
two years in a row. The securities industry also faces excess capacity: Too
many firms are fighting for the same business. Aggressive up-and-comers
range from Germany's Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland to U.S.
commercial banks. ``It's a difficult challenge to continue to maintain high
margins,'' says Jerome P. Kenney, a Merrill Lynch executive
vice-president.
   With so much competition, consolidation is expected to continue in 1996.
Rumors constantly have firms dressing themselves up for sale. Some of them,
such as Lehman Brothers Inc., PaineWebber Inc., and Prudential Securities,
are medium-size firms that are finding it expensive to compete
internationally. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan
Stanley are spending heavily to position themselves as global competitors
that can remain independent. ``In 1996, the large will get larger, small
boutiques will prosper, and those in the middle will get squeezed,'' says
Bruce S. Foerster, president of South Beach Capital Markets Advisory Corp.
in Miami.
   Whether large or small, brokerage stocks are due for a correction.
Analysts aren't as hot on them, since they had a spectacular rise in 1995.
Merrill Lynch & Co. shares rose 51% through mid-December, and Charles
Schwab & Co. was up 86%. Mergers and acquisitions, hottest in banking and
media, might lose some steam.
   There are bright spots. Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage, sees
continued growth in its retail business. Its equity assets under management
have grown significantly in 1995 simply because the stock market was up
37%. This increase means more asset-management fee income in 1996, even if
the growth of assets slows. And following a dismal 1995 in many emerging
markets, Merrill is looking for an improvement in 1996.
   The entire industry may get a boost from Washington. A capital-gains tax
cut and a restoration of tax deductibility for individual retirement
accounts look likely in 1996, says Marc E. Lackritz, president of the
Securities Industry Assn., since ``there is broad agreement among the
House, the Senate, and the Administration that this is a good idea.'' The
SIA estimates the IRA change alone could earn the industry as much as $200
million a year in additional IRA mutual-fund fees.
   Of course, it's the unexpected that hurts markets the most, as in the
last big market plunge with the gulf war in 1991. A recession or sharply
higher rates are constant worries. But it now looks as if Wall Street can
spend another happy year looking forward to bonus time.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The soaring stock market is boosting the brokerage business.
   -- Mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs should remain strong.
   -- Congress may cut capital-gains taxes and restore deductibility of
IRAs.

Negatives
   -- Brokerage stocks are due for a correction after their big 1995
runup.
   -- Overcapacity in the industry will keep restraining margins.

A YEAR OF HIGH-RISE EXPECTATIONS
The office market expects a banner year, while other markets look less
robust

By:
By Amy Barrett in Washington


For much of the past two years, the real estate and construction industry
celebrated the return of growth. Having survived the dark days of the early
1990s, investors savored the recovery of apartment and retail properties,
followed by offices and hotels. But 1996 will be more of a mixed bag. On
the downside, there are early signs of overheating in some markets for
construction of apartment and retail space. On the upside, a stronger
housing market should help pick up the slack. And with office occupancy and
rents improving, 1996 will mark the return of one fixture of the 1980s:
high-rise office projects.
   The generally good news for real estate stems largely from the continued
decline of interest rates. Lower rates helped spark homebuilding in the
second half of 1995. And National Association of Home Builders Chief
Economist David F. Seiders figures moderate economic growth will lead to
even lower mortgage rates in 1996, averaging about 7.3% for 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages. That should nudge multi- and single-family housing
starts up about 3%, to nearly 1.4 million. The days of speculative boom and
bust are gone: ``People look at houses as shelter rather than as an
investment strategy, and frankly that's pretty healthy,'' says Bruce E.
Karatz, chairman of Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.
   Apartment construction continues to pick up steam. According to the
NAHB, construction will begin on 290,000 apartments in 1996, up a bit from
1995's 274,000. While that is still less than half the 1985 frenzied peak
of nearly 670,000 units, industry pros are warning that some Sunbelt
markets, such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, may already be overbuilt.
BANNER YEAR. In retail construction, megamerchants such as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. are aggressively expanding. But it
doesn't appear that the market is headed for a repeat of the overbuilding
binge of the 1980s. Retail construction should fall 10% in 1996, according
to The McGraw-Hill Companies' F.W. Dodge unit. One reason: Aside from the
retail giants that can finance their own expansion, ``capital is pretty
well cut off to that sector,'' says Douglas A. Tibbetts, president of
Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc.
   Players in the office market expect 1996 to be a banner year. Thanks in
no small part to the explosive growth of high-technology companies, office
vacancy rates continue to slide. And the strength of the market is sparking
not only build-to-suit construction but some partially speculative building
in tight markets. Arthur J. Mirante II, chief executive officer of Cushman
& Wakefield Inc., says some cities will see construction with as little as
50% of the project pre-leased. ``The fundamentals for office haven't been
this good in 10 years,'' says Thomas A. Carr, president of Carr Realty
Corp. in Washington, D.C.
   Still, not all markets are booming. Los Angeles and downtown Dallas,
which has a staggering vacancy rate of 35%, are still struggling. And
Arthur Andersen & Co. Managing Director Barry D. Libert warns that better
and cheaper telecommunications will allow more tenants in the future to
avoid downtown locations. As a result, office operators will be forced to
beef up their marketing and improve the flexibility of lease packages.
   Perhaps the best buys around remain high-end hotel properties. Outside
of Las Vegas, there is little new construction of luxury hotels. And
Japanese investors who overpaid for such properties in the 1980s continue
to sell. A Japanese bank recently sold the 539-room Ritz Carlton Hotel,
Mauna Lani, in Hawaii, built for $180 million, for just $75 million.
SMALL FAVORS. While the Japanese are selling, U.S. real estate continues to
attract U.S. pension funds, which should cautiously expand their holdings
in 1996, as well as foreign investors, from such places as Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and Germany. Real estate investment trusts aren't raising a lot of
money through public offerings--investment dollars have gone into the
booming stock market instead--but they're discovering that private
placements can work, too. For instance, Carr Realty struck a deal in
November that will result in a $250 million investment in the REIT by
Security Capital U.S. Realty. Carr plans to use the capital to build and
buy offices across the country.
   1996 won't see a return to the glory days of leaping prices. But these
days, most real estate executives are thankful for slow but steady
progress.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The office sector will continue to recover, thanks in part to strong
demand by high-tech companies.
   -- Upscale hotels should enjoy rising room rates and healthy occupancy
levels.

Negatives
   -- Some shopping centers will feel the squeeze from a sluggish retail
market.
   -- With apartment construction still picking up steam, some Sunbelt
markets may already be overbuilt.

LOOKING FOR SAFETY IN NUMBERS
Consolidation--and competition from other investments--are changing the
business

By:
By Tim Smart in New Haven


If there is one word that sums up prospects for the insurance industry in
1996, it's consolidation. Last year saw a record $18 billion worth of
insurance-company mergers and acquisitions, and there's no letup in sight.
``There are too many players competing for too little return in a crowded
marketplace,'' says Eric Simpson, a vice-president at rating agency A.M.
Best Co.
   The late November announcement of Travelers Inc.'s $4 billion purchase
of Aetna Life & Casualty's property-casualty unit capped a year in which
CNA Financial swallowed Continental Insurance for $1.1 billion and Zurich
Insurance took over Home Insurance. The same pressures that forced these
deals--weak returns, large exposures to environmental claims, and lack of
sufficient capital to keep ratings up--are expected to continue in 1996.
While the companies have said nothing publicly, analysts believe that CIGNA
Corp. and Prudential Insurance Co. are among the big-name companies
considering selling their property and casualty units.
CUTTING OVERHEAD. For property-casualty insurers, two big helpers are low
inflation and low interest rates. The benign operating environment in 1995
led to a doubling of net income, to $22.3 billion from $10.9 billion in
1994.
   In 1996, however, property-casualty insurers should see only a modest
uptick in their business. A survey of Wall Street analysts by Insurance
Information Institute found them expecting growth in premium dollar volume
of about 4.6% in 1996. While that would be better than the 3.9% rate of
growth in 1995, it will still lag behind the growth of the early 1990s. The
problem: continued price pressures from overcapacity, especially in
commercial lines, such as general business liability and workers'
compensation. ``There has been no fundamental improvement in underlying
performance during the last five years,'' says Robert Stein, director of
Ernst & Young's insurance-industry practice.
   With paltry premium growth, property- casualty insurers will have to cut
overhead, now a quarter on every dollar of premium. Travelers hopes to trim
$300 million from operating expenses and cut 3,000 jobs when it takes over
the Aetna unit.
   The consolidation trend affecting property-casualty writers is no less
dramatic in life insurance. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and New England
Mutual Life Insurance Co. have announced plans to merge, while several
operators, such as General Electric Capital Services Inc., went on buying
sprees. Here, the motivation is increasing assets under management to
compete with gargantuan mutual-fund houses and other financial-services
conglomerates.
EXPENSIVE DISTRIBUTION. Life insurers enter 1996 facing continued weakness
in their core business as more Americans turn away from traditional life
insurance to investment products such as mutual funds. While mutual funds
are sold through low-cost, consumer-oriented direct marketing such as
television, life insurers still sell their products mainly face-to-face
through an expensive network of agents.
   A survey by consultant Towers Perrin found that the No.1 issue of
concern for life-insurance chief executive officers is improving their
distribution system. Towers Perrin consultant Rick Berry estimates that
distribution makes up two-thirds of the cost of a life-insurance policy.
``Traditional life companies have delegated to their agents decisions like
what mix of products to sell, what markets to pick, and how to promote the
products,'' says Berry. Many life insurers have begun striking deals with
banks to sell their products, a trend that is likely to accelerate in
1996.
   Insurers have had good results selling annuities, which typically offer
income or capital gains as well as life insurance. The 13% rate of growth
for annuities is four times the rate for traditional life insurance
products. But competition is getting fierce. ``It's a changing landscape,''
says CNA Chairman and CEO Dennis H. Chookaszian. ``Banks will be a much
more significant seller of these products in the future.'' A positive for
life insurers is that their mortgage and real estate problems of the early
1990s have largely dissipated, while strong financial markets have helped
investment returns.
   A couple of years back, few would have imagined alliances such as
Travelers' bold deal with Aetna or life insurance companies allowing their
competitors in banking to sell their products. But as the historically
underperforming insurance industry tries to catch up to the new world order
in financial services, it is learning to adapt.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Life insurers are holding on to their share of retirement assets.
   -- Property-casualty writers are increasing reserves for environmental
claims.
   -- Losses from claims are moderating.

Negatives
   -- Much of the industry's increased capital is coming from investment
gains, not core earnings.
   -- With 2,400 competitors, the business is ripe for consolidation.

THE TOP MANAGERS OF 1995
What did it take for an executive to succeed in the past year?

Good managers know how to cut: They trim costs, reengineer, and
restructure. Great managers know how to grow: They realize you can't shrink
your way to greatness. In 1995, the best managers in the world grew their
way to greatness.
   The men and women of BUSINESS WEEK's Top 25 Managers of the
Year--Americans, Europeans, Asians--all rode the tiger of growth to
spectacular success. In a global economy of vast technological change,
intense competition, and political upheaval, these managers cranked out
annual increases of 20%, 30%, sometimes even 40% in profits and
sales--while other corporate ``titans'' were still trimming their sails and
eking out marginal gains.
   What did it take for an executive to make it into BUSINESS WEEK's Top
25? Begin with product innovation--the hot strategy of the year for
managers who had already wrung out their corporate inefficiencies. When the
bureaucratic layers are gone, when the marginal competencies are dumped,
the only strategic assets left to corporations are the products they sell
in the global marketplace. This was proved in 1995, when the most reliable
path to fast growth was to bring out new products adored by lots of
consumers.
   Riding the technological currents was the favorite tactic used by
managers in bringing out their innovations in 1995. But managers also had
to take risks, especially the risk of cannibalizing old models with new
products. There was new software for personal computers and the Internet,
color copier/printers for the home office, and even new first-class seats
that fold out into beds. All were smash hits.
   BUSINESS WEEK's top managers used corporate alliances to drive their
growth. American and European managers divvied up the incredibly successful
DBS launch--direct broadcast satellite transmission of TV and stereo music.
A French-owned company built the 12-inch satellite dishes for the home, and
the Americans developed the satellites and software to close the loop.
Nearly two million homes in the U.S. now have DBS. This global cooperation
generated tremendous growth for all concerned. So did alliances between
industries: One software giant linked up with a corporation running a TV
network to provide new information products over the wire.
   Top managers used globalization strategies wisely to boost growth. Asian
territories outside Japan proved once again to be the fastest-growing
markets in the world in 1995. Every smart manager wanted a bigger piece of
the Asian pie. Some succeeded, as did one investment banker who was able to
cut a deal enabling his firm to do business inside China. Another American
manager reversed strategy and revitalized his heavy capital equipment
company by focusing on new opportunities in Europe.
   Then there were Asian managers using the global markets to move outside
their region into other parts of the world. One computer maker divided his
operation into 21 smaller companies so that each could list on the stock
market where it did most of its business.
   Of course, reengineering remained important as a catalyst for growth for
some top managers. One new Japanese manager quietly restructured ingrown
business practices of his company and led it to a projected doubling of net
profit and a record year. An American continued to reshape a traditional
defense-base conglomerate into a tough market-oriented competitor.
   How did BUSINESS WEEK come up with its Top 25 Managers of the Year? The
magazine polled its 220 editors around the world, including its large
foreign bureau system, the largest of any global business magazine. The
methodology was deceptively simple: screening the financial figures,
questioning the best analytical minds, and talking to the leading corporate
managers around the world. The bureaus asked: Who was the best in 1995?
Here's the collective reply.

THE BEST MANAGERS

Managing big corporations in 1995 was tougher than ever. It was hard to
raise prices, technological change accelerated, and globalization meant
more competition. Achieving growth meant taking more risks. These 25
managers were the top winners in the global game.

GERALD GREENWALD

It isn't easy running a huge employee-owned airline, but GERALD GREENWALD,
chairman of UAL, managed to make lots of people happy in 1995. By more than
doubling the stock price, to $211, Greenwald, 60, put big smiles on all
investors: Wall Street, pilots, and machinists, although fourth-quarter
earnings estimates didn't meet analysts' expectations. Earnings are still
expected to hit about $900 million, triple 1994's figure.

With the booming sales of Acer's Aspire personal computer, a multimedia
desktop designed for the home, Acer Chairman and CEO STAN SHIH solidified
his position in 1995 as Asia's paramount entrepreneur. By decentralizing
ownership (he is spinning off 21 independent companies), Shih remains close
to his customers. Revenues for the Taiwan-based group in 1995 are expected
to be up 77%, to $5.7 billion.

It all came together in 1995 for ARTHUR C. MARTINEZ, CEO of Sears Roebuck
and the mastermind of the Big Store's comeback. His drive to renovate dowdy

Hot Java! Sun Microsystems CEO SCOTT G. McNEALY went eye to eye with Bill

million, on sales of $5.9 billion in fiscal 1995.

When JEAN-PIERRE ROSSO took over heavy-equipment manufacturer Case in 1994,
it hadn't turned much of a profit in years. Cost-cutting by parent Tenneco
stopped the bleeding, but there was no strategy. He redesigned Case's
outdated construction- and agricultural-equipment lines and focused on
Europe. The payoff? Earnings in 1995 should double, to $250 million, on an
11% hike in sales, to $4.8 billion.

America's world-leading aluminum companies. Aluminum Co. of America's CEO,
60-year-old PAUL H. O'NEILL, pushed for a multinational solution, which
included painful smelter shutdowns in the U.S. He also pressed forward with
global acquisitions, from Italy to Australia. With aluminum prices on the
rebound in 1995 and world supply and demand on a more even keel, Alcoa
motored to strong earnings.

MANAGERS TO WATCH IN 1996

Abigail Johnson, 34, is heir very apparent at Fidelity Investments. The
boss's daughter owns 24.5% of Fidelity. That makes her a billionaire, but
is she a manager capable of taking over from Dad, Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson
III, who is 65? So far, Abby has dodged a role in senior management to
manage money. Will she become chairwoman and leave day-to-day management to
others?

Eric A. Benhamou, chief executive officer of 3Com, loves to manage--other
businesses, that is. He is Silicon Valley's gentlest takeover artist. His
3Com pulled off 10 acquisitions worth $1 billion in three years. Now he's
trying to persuade Wall Street that he can make money in the expanding
market for lower-end networking gear and PC network cards for small
business and the home. Tired of slowpoke modems? Call Benhamou.

Ford Chairman Alex Trotman probably has the toughest job in Detroit in
1996. Customers aren't stampeding to his newly styled Taurus. Ford is
overhauling 40% of its entire U.S. product line and 35% of its European
offerings. Trotman is under pressure to find a way to move all these new,
more expensive models in a market that is interested only in bargains. Will
lower rates give Trotman some breathing room by cutting leasing costs?

In April, 1995, Nobuyuki Idei, 58, became the first nonengineer to lead
Sony, replacing Norio Ohga. He quickly dumped Mickey Shulhoff, Sony's
high-profile U.S. head. Idei speaks fluent English and French, but it has
yet to be seen whether he can speak Hollywoodese.

Bill Gates faces his biggest challenge in years. While the 40-year-old
chairman of Microsoft has the PC software market sewn up--not so the
mushrooming Internet world. In December, Gates mapped out an ambitious
Internet strategy. Then he licensed Java, the hot Internet software. Is
this a new beginning or the end of his hegemony?

For as long as Jerry Levin has been chairman of Time Warner, investors have
wondered if he had the ``it'' of leadership. This fall he acted boldly and
acquired Turner Broadcasting System. But now he has to stir up that magic
synergy, something he couldn't do between Time Inc. and Warner. Is this his
last shot?

Gerhardt Schulmeyer, chief executive at German computer and telecom company
Siemens Nixdorf Informations Systems, is aiming to topple Big Blue in
Europe. But can he break the great resistance to change within Germany's
telecom industry? If Schulmeyer can't do it in 1996, Germany will only fall
further behind.

Whoever thought an obscure animal-feed ingredient could lead to so much
fuss? But for Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, lysine
could be his Waterloo. Federal antitrust investigators are reviewing hours
of taped conversations provided by a former employee, Mark Whitacre, who
claims ADM fixed lysine prices. Meantime, under fire from shareholders,
Andreas, 77, has appointed a committee of outside directors to put ADM
corporate governance under a microscope. Can he survive another year?

Ditto for Michael H. Spindler. With first-quarter results ending Dec. 31 in
the red, following a year of takeover rumors and boardroom turmoil, Apple
Computer's embattled CEO is hanging on by a thread. The board is backing
him for now.

Insiders says W. James McNerney Jr., a 46-year-old Yale graduate and
Harvard MBA, is a front-runner in the race to succeed Jack Welch as CEO of
General Electric. In October, Welch pulled McNerney away from a critical
post as head of GE's Asia operations to take over management of the $3
billion lighting unit.

Lester M. Alberthal Jr. may soon find himself running an independent
Electronic Data Systems, the information services giant in Plano, Tex. EDS
has been part of General Motors since 1984, when it was sold by famous
founder Ross Perot. GM announced in August, 1995, that it planned to spin
off EDS if it can get the Internal Revenue Service's approval for a
tax-free deal. Analysts expect EDS's independence day to come by the
spring.

When you're running for your life, do you reach for a Snapple or a
Gatorade? William D. Smithburg, CEO of the Quaker Oats, has his hands full
with both. His dominant Gatorade franchise faces a terrific challenge in
'96 as Coca-Cola promotes its rival sports drink, Powerade, at the 1996
Olympics. He has even knottier problems with his Snapple franchise.

Can Hiroshi Okuda cure Toyota's big-company disease? In August, the
63-year-old finance man became president of Japan's largest auto maker, the
first non-Toyoda family member to run the company. Many see the bold
executive as the best hope for a fresh breeze at Toyota.

Can a power-tool marketing whiz finally put some drive back into Polaroid?
On Dec. 1, 44-year-old Gary T. DiCamillo took the reins as the new CEO.
Given credit for reviving Black & Decker's consumer power tool business,
he's now charged with resurrecting a company that has been drifting
sideways for years.

Journalists recoiled in 1995 as new Times Mirror CEO Mark H. Willes closed
New York Newsday and ordered layoffs at the flagship Los Angeles Times.
Willes, a 15-year veteran of General Mills, was brought in to repair years
of sluggish profits at Times Mirror. His goal: boost earnings per share by
50% in 1996.

THE BEST ENTREPRENEURS

An amazing year for entrepreneurs! A new club was formed:
double-billionaire winners. Jim Clark did it once with Silicon Graphics and
came back with Netscape. Steve Jobs hit it big with Apple-took a long
break-and won again with Pixar. The hurdle was certainly raised in '95.

STEVE JOBS

How sweet it is. STEVE JOBS, co-founder of Apple Computer, has been trying
to come up with a second hit for a decade. No such luck--until Nov. 29.
That's when his company, Pixar Animation Studios, makers of the smash hit
movie Toy Story, went public with a bang. The stock, priced at 22, zoomed
to 49 before falling back to 24. Jobs's 80% stake was briefly worth $1.1
billion. What's next? His other company, NeXT, is making Web software, and
Jobs may see his third IPO in early 1996.

HAS CADDY TURNED THE CORNER?

   I have received numerous inquiries from your readership concerning ``A
Caddy that's not for Daddy'' (The Corporation, Dec. 18). Despite
considerable disclosure of facts and open discussion, your author chose to
include her opinions and the clearly biased opinions of our competitors
without including any of our perspective.
   With regard to our reduction in sales volume: Cadillac's planned and
profitable reduction of daily rental fleet sales accounts for much of the
reduction in the division's sales from 1989 to 1995. While we chose not to
foreshadow our 1995 calendar year forecasts to competitors by providing
them for this story, we did provide a yearly accounting of our daily rental
fleet reduction statistics (from 32% of total sales in 1991 to 18% in
1994). We expected that disclosure of this plan and accompanying
performance would not be omitted from your review of our sales
performance.
   As for our dealers, you characterized the perception of them as
``salesmen in white belts and plaid sport coats'' and continued to
perpetrate a disservice to our very professional dealer personnel. Our
dealers consistently earn high customer-satisfaction scores and were once
again rated No.1 domestic luxury nameplate in a recent J.D. Power &
Associates Inc. Sales Satisfaction Survey, second only to Infiniti and
ahead of Lexus, Mercedes, Lincoln, BMW, and all other luxury brands.
   You also raise questions about our customer demographics. Fundamental
changes in our owner demographic profile have resulted from the
introduction of the 1992 Seville, Seville Touring Sedan, and Eldorado
models. The author accurately quoted the average age of ``some model''
owners at nearly 70. Specifically, this model is the Fleetwood, which we
are eliminating from the model line this year. A fair accounting of our
progress would also have noted that the average age of Seville STS owners
is 52 years, an average age that has been reduced by six years since the
introduction of this model in 1991.
   Regarding side air bags, we were disappointed to note that your author
chose to omit the rollout of air bags in the 1997 DeVille model, mentioning
only the introduction for Catera in mid-1997 and again creating the
appearance that Cadillac was behind other luxury manufacturers in the
implementation of this technology. The introduction of the side air bags at
the beginning of the 1997 model year on the DeVille was made very clear in
our interview.
   Finally, you refer to us as ``an industry joke.'' In spite of the fact
that nine new models have been added to the luxury market from two all-new
manufacturers (Lexus and Infiniti) since 1989, Cadillac continues as volume
leader in the U.S. luxury market--a title held for the last 46 years. The
DeVille remains America's most-purchased luxury sedan--a title held for the
past nine years. The Northstar-powered Seville STS is a recognized
technology tour de force among automotive critics and enthusiastic owners.
The all-new Catera has been reviewed favorably by all of the author's
colleagues.
   The above-listed facts and many other positive points concerning
Cadillac's overall performance were omitted from your story. Our market
leadership and product leadership makes preposterous the notion that
Cadillac is the brunt of jokes in the industry. To the contrary, our
product technology and large loyal owner base are the envy of the
industry.

General Manager
Cadillac Motor Car Div.

Editor's note: Cadillac supplied numbers on fleet sales only through 1994
and acknowledged that it expected total sales to decline by 15% in 1995.
Our description of the negative perception of Cadillac dealers focused on
younger buyers it hopes to attract with the Catera and matches the Catera
team's own characterization of its consumer research.

   Your story on the Catera missed the mark. As I see it, Catera is yet
another encouraging step as Cadillac transforms itself. Why keep harping on
the Cimarron, unquestionably a Stone Age disaster? Cadillac left the Stone
Age long ago. Why not mention the Seville Touring Sedan, Detroit's most
exciting world car? What about the national Baldrige Quality Award Cadillac
received in recognition of quality and changes in culture? And what about
the Northstar system? You're much too bleak. At 57, I am most certainly a
Daddy. But Catera just may be the Caddy I've been waiting for--and my
boomer son, too.

   Regarding General Motors Corp.'s plans for the new Catera, your article
left out a few more mistakes that the Cadillac Div. has made in past years
besides the Cimarron and the Allante. How about the 8-6-4 engines and the
early model Sevilles?
   Cadillac had better be satisfied with its grandfather image, because any
middle-aged luxury-car buff worth his salt would not even think about a new
Cadillac, considering the company's track record for the past 15 years.
Especially with introductory models.

`TERRORISTS SHOULD NEVER BE CONFUSED WITH DISSIDENTS'

   I must take exception to your story about Saudi Arabia in your Nov. 27
issue (``A dangerous spark in the oil fields,'' International Business).
BUSINESS WEEK played into the hands of terrorists by trying to create a
link between the terrorist car bombing in Riyadh that claimed the lives of
five Americans and the internal situation in our country.
   Even though no one knows yet who committed this act of murder, your
article stated that the car bombing ``suggests once again that internal
enemies, not external ones, may now be the biggest threats'' to states on
the Arabian Peninsula.
   Whether in the U.S., Israel, France, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, people may
disagree about internal policies. But terrorists should never be confused
with dissidents. Terrorists kill because they are criminals and murderers.
They do not need an ``excuse,'' especially feeble ones such as ``belt
tightening,'' as cited in your article.
   The ``internal situation'' that you described did not cause the car
bombing any more than the U.S. budget crisis caused the Oklahoma City
bombing. Terrorism is a meaningless act. As your story revealed, if you
search for ``reasons,'' you will only be led astray.

EXPORT DIVERSION, MAYBE. DUMPING, ABSOLUTELY

   Regarding ``Exports that aren't going anywhere'' (Legal Affairs, Dec.
4), I'd feel sorrier for companies whose low-priced exports are being
diverted back to the U.S. if they weren't meeting the classic definition of
dumping: selling at a lower price in a foreign country than they do
domestically.
   When a foreign manufacturer sells at a lower cost in the U.S. than it
does in its own country, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is all over
them. Are American companies claiming injury when their dumping activities
result in the obvious economic consequences? Wait until the other
countries' FTC equivalents get through with them.
   The reality is that price differentials are extremely difficult to
maintain in the global economy. If the law doesn't get you, economics
will.

TRAVELERS DOESN'T TRAFFIC IN HARD SELLING

   Your recent article on ``How Travelers got moving again'' (Finance, Dec.
4) stated that CEO Robert I. Lipp ``began pushing Travelers homeowners' and
auto policies through the PFS network of 100,000 hard-sell part-time
agents, who work for commissions far below the typical 15% paid...'' The
article was great, but the connotation that PFS agents employ hard-sell
tactics is incorrect. Roughly 80% of the sales force is in fact part-time
and does not rely on commissions to make a living. Thus, the basic PFS
approach is educational, not confrontational. Part-time PFS agents do not
have to make the sale to put food on the table. Hard sell? Nothing could be
further from the truth.

A WINNING NUMBER FOR THE LABORITES?
The national lottery flap may further undermine the Tories

By:
By Julia Flynn in London


`Scamalot.'' That's what critics are now calling Camelot Group PLC, the
for-profit, Anglo-American consortium running Britain's national lottery.
After barely a year of operation, Camelot Group is weathering a storm of
controversy. Among the allegations are offering bribes, cozying up to
government regulators, and paying top executives unseemly salaries for the
low-risk chore of peddling lottery tickets to wager-loving Britons.
   The consortium denies any impropriety, and no one at Camelot has been
formally charged with any wrongdoing. No matter. The Labor Party is turning
Scamalot into a referendum on the ruling Tories' laissez-faire approach to
business. With elections just a year away, Labor will do everything to keep
the issue hot. Pressure already is mounting to revamp government oversight
of the lottery and to turn the operation over to a not-for-profit group
when Camelot's license expires in 2001.
   The Conservatives had reasoned that a for-profit business would operate
a lottery more efficiently than a state-run firm. So after reviewing both
for-profit and not-for-profit bids, the government went with Camelot. It's
composed of four British companies--candy and soft-drinks giant Cadbury
Schweppes, computer maker ICL, Racal Electronics, and banknote printer De
La Rue--and one U.S. company, lottery operator GTech Corp. A new government
agency--the Office of the National Lottery, or Oflot--oversees Camelot.
``SMELL FACTOR.'' By December, Camelot was estimating it would sell $7
billion worth of tickets and scratch cards in its first year, making the
lottery one of the world's biggest. Then controversy flared. On a BBC
investigative program, Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways,
alleged that Guy B. Snowden, GTech's co-chairman and a Camelot director,
had offered him a bribe to withdraw his group's bid for the lottery.
Branson said he informed Oflot's director general, Peter Davis, of the
alleged bribe, but Davis denies being told. Snowden labels the charges
``beneath contempt'' and is considering a libel suit against Branson, who
is already suing GTech for libel. On Dec. 20, Davis said an investigation
would begin in January.
   The same day as the BBC broadcast, Davis admitted to a House of Commons
committee that he had accepted rides in GTech's jets, helicopters, and
limousines while touring state lotteries in the U.S. Davis also has
acknowledged a close friendship with GTech board member Carl B. Menges. In
a heated debate, Labor member Donald Anderson argued that the ``smell
factor'' prevents Davis from having ``the credibility necessary for the
performance of his functions.'' The government so far has refused to sack
Davis.
SCRUTINIZED. Labor MPs also are raising questions about whether Oflot let
Camelot profit at the expense of the good causes it is supposed to fund.
Camelot made a $37 million profit on revenues of $3.9 billion during the
half-year ended in September and paid out a $14.6 million dividend to its
five shareholders, the maximum payout allowed under its license. Yet in a
September 1994 letter to an MP, Oflot's Davis wrote that based on the
consortium's forecast he expected it would be ``over four years before
Camelot shows a cash return on its investment.'' Camelot says it did not
``deliberately understate'' its expected returns.
   Meanwhile, Camelot's pay packets are raising eyebrows, too. Camelot
Chief Executive Tim Holley received $682,785 for 1995, including a $184,800
bonus. Holley declines to comment. Oflot says it doesn't regulate the pay
at Camelot, but in a country where high salaries arouse ire, this argument
is hardly convincing. Says Denis Vaughan, an orchestra conductor who
started the move for a lottery to help the arts: ``Oflot is more of a
lapdog than a watchdog.''
   GTech merits far closer watching as well, Camelot's critics say. The
Rhode Island-based company, which operates 74 lotteries for governments and
other public authorities, has endured scrutiny for its methods of winning
contracts in the U.S. Its former national sales manager, J. David Smith,
has been charged by federal prosecutors with taking kickbacks in New
Jersey. GTech has never been charged with a crime and says it was
victimized by Smith, who is vigorously defending himself. Nonetheless,
critics are calling for a reexamination of GTech's role in Camelot.
   Scamalot will make even more headlines when the inquiry starts probing
Branson's allegations. The way things are going, Camelot's partners may
come to regret that they ever bet on this business.

TOSSING A LIFELINE TO MEXICO'S BIGGEST BANKS
Even Banamex and Bancomer are getting a state bailout

By:
By Geri Smith in Mexico City


Mexico's yearlong economic crisis has been murder on the country's banking
system. The government has been forced to take over six banks and bail out
nine others. But the prevailing wisdom was always that the system's crown
jewels, Banamex and Bancomer, would easily weather the storm. Now they,
too, are in sufficient distress that the government is preparing to assume
chunks of their troubled loan portfolios--and those of two other banks. The
cost: More than $4 billion on top of the $11 billion the government has
already spent on bailouts. The government effort has already grown so
massive that some critics are saying that the banks are being
renationalized.
   It's a stunning reversal. Just four years ago, the government made $13.5
billion selling off the state-controlled banks to some of Mexico's cockiest
entrepreneurs. They plunked down an average of three times book value for
18 banks, figuring that the economic reforms of then President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, coupled with free trade with the U.S., would guarantee
vigorous economic growth and handsome profits.
SICK SYSTEM. Instead, the new owners have seen the value of their holdings
devastated by the high interest rates and bad loans that are the hallmarks
of the financial crisis. With borrowers unable to pay, past-due loans now
exceed $17 billion--18% of the system's portfolio. If tougher U.S.
accounting standards were applied, the figure would be as high as
35%--meaning the system is very sick. One big loser is financier Agustin
Legoretta III, whose investor group has lost nearly all the $1.4 billion it
paid for Grupo Financiero Inverlat--now a ward of the state.
   The banks' problems present a big threat to President Ernesto Zedillo
Ponce de Leon's pledges that the economy will recover in 1996. The country
needs healthy banks to finance any recovery. Yet, Standard & Poor's Corp.
says Mexican banks won't start to turn around until the third quarter of
1996 because banks and borrowers are still being hit by 50% interest
rates.
   The worry is that Mexico's banking problems will be a drag on the
economy for years. Moody's Investors Service warns that the bank bailout
could cost 10% to 15% of GDP, or up to $40 billion. That would slow growth
and suck Mexican and international funding away from other uses. With many
economists expecting the economy to shrink in early 1996, the government
may have to step in with more money soon. ``The government is providing
Band-Aids to the banks as they come for help, but the real cancer--the
past-due loans--has not been eliminated,'' says economist Rogelio Ramirez
de la O.
   The government doesn't have any easy way out of this mess. Confidence in
Mexico is so low that if the government tries to help the banks by bringing
rates down, the markets will likely pummel the peso and Mexican securities.
That's what happened last fall when market jitters forced an upward spike
in rates, producing a flurry of new defaults.
WARY INVESTORS. In October, Standard & Poor's downgraded Banamex' peso debt
to BBB-, S&P's lowest investment-grade rating. In response, the loan-buyout
program, previously used to help smaller banks, was extended to Banamex and
Bancomer, which together control 39% of the system's assets. ``Banamex and
Bancomer are the most important banks in Mexico, and we simply can't run
the risk that their finances might deteriorate,'' says Eduardo Fernandez,
president of Mexico's Banking & Securities Commission.
   The banks' troubles present a buying opportunity for foreign
banks--though most are wary of getting entangled in a Mexican bank now. But
Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya paid $340 million to buy control of troubled
Mercantil Probursa in July. Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia is negotiating to
assume control of Inverlat. And Bancomer is shopping around for a foreign
minority investor to inject fresh capital.
   As they grapple with the banks' problems, Mexican officials now concede
that they mishandled the bank sell-off in the early 1990s. Too much
emphasis was placed on obtaining high prices and too little emphasis on the
banking skills of the buyers. ``In retrospect, I would have applied some of
the purchase price to better capitalization of the banks,'' says Finance
Secretary Guillermo Ortiz, who was in charge of the privatization program
then and is responsible for bailing the banks out now. He is probably
doomed to spend a long time correcting his mistake.

APPLE: ANOTHER BOUT OF BAD TIDINGS
Profit pressure may bring layoffs and suitors

By:
By Peter Burrows, with Kathy Rebello, in San Francisco and Steve Brull in
Tokyo


Mike Spindler just can't get a break. Instead of celebrating the blowout
sales he expected this Christmas quarter, Apple Computer Inc.'s CEO is
bracing for a very rough ride. In mid-December, the company warned of a
possible loss during the period, and analysts fear the worst--layoffs,
projects killed, maybe more losses. Some even say Apple will have little
choice but to sell off parts, if not all, of the business. And there are
again rumors that Spindler's job is in jeopardy. Says Robertson, Stephens &
Co. analyst John T. Rossi, who doesn't foresee profits again until next
fall: ``Apple is in a tougher spot than it's been in for a long time.''
   The reason? Banking on a strong season, Apple pumped up production by
about 30%. To move its many Macintosh models, the company slashed prices.
Simultaneously, it faced a shortage of profitable high-end models. To make
matters worse, Apple was slammed by a vicious price war in Japan. The net
result: On Dec. 15, Apple announced that its unit sales and revenue for the
Christmas quarter were running above last year's level but below internal
forecasts. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst Eugene G. Glazer now expects
Apple to report a $5 million loss for the quarter, down from a $178 million
profit on sales of $2.8 billion for the same quarter a year ago. Glazer
figures Apple's gross margins for the period slipped to a tiny 18.2%.
CREDIT WATCH. Apple has gained market share worldwide, hitting 9.3% of the
PC market this fall, up from 7.9% at midyear, figures New York-based
researcher Link/IDC. Apple execs see the share improvement as critical,
maintaining that software developers--and then customers--will abandon the
Mac if it loses more ground to PC rivals. But to make its market-share
gains, Apple sacrificed profitability--and its long-held tenet that
consumers are willing to pay a premium for its computers. Recent price cuts
narrowed the gap between Macs and PCs from $1,000-plus in 1994 to $320, IDC
figures.
   Apple isn't giving up on its strategy. It recently sweetened discounts
to big resellers with $20 million worth of Mac sales a year. And dealers
say Apple will cut prices 10% again in January on some PowerBook laptops
and high-end 9500 Power Macs. But outsiders worry that Apple can't afford
its crusade. Analysts figure Apple's cash balance is down to $200 million.
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services started reviews of Apple's
credit on Dec. 18.
   That makes internal cost-cutting crucial. Insiders say between 1,000 and
2,000 employees--7% to 15% of the workforce--could be let go before
quarterly results come out on Jan. 17. More manufacturing also may be
outsourced, and nascent businesses--such as multimedia set-top boxes--may
be sold or axed.
   Some outsiders contend even that won't do it. Glazer says slashing 1,500
jobs translates into $100 million in yearly savings, vs the $450 million he
thinks Apple needs to reach Compaq Computer Corp.'s 23.5% gross margins and
earn its 10% net. To fuel development of the Mac alone, Apple spends about
5.6% of sales on R&D, vs. 1.8% for Compaq.
   Spindler engineered Apple out of a similar crisis in 1993, when he laid
off 13% of the workforce and took a one-time quarterly loss of $188
million. Can he do it again? With gross margins way down, he has less room
to maneuver. Thanks to a bloody price war started by Fujitsu Ltd., Apple's
Japanese unit, normally the source of 30% of the company's profits, will be
lucky to break even this quarter, analysts in Japan say.
   Despite rumors, insiders think it's unlikely Spindler will get the boot
at Apple's scheduled board meeting in mid-January. ``The board stands
behind the statement in October in support of Michael Spindler,'' says a
director.
TROIKA TALES. Apple's troubles, meanwhile, have lowered its share price by
34% since mid-July, to about $32--not far above the company's book value of
$23.50. That has made Apple takeover bait. Two new suitors said to be
sniffing around: Sun Microsystems and a three-way partnership of Apple
co-founder Steve Jobs, who left in 1985; Lawrence Ellison, CEO of software
giant Oracle; and Jim Manzi, former chief of Lotus Development, the
software company recently taken over by IBM.
   Sun execs won't comment on rumors, though Eric E. Schmidt, its chief
technology officer, calls Apple ``a strong brand.'' As for the troika? No
way, says Jobs: ``The rumor ain't true. Though there might be romance in
the idea, I'm afraid one can't go home again.'' The question: How much
breathing room does Spindler have left?

THE COMEBACK KID OF RUSSIA?
Yeltsin has no charismatic rival, and the economy looks better

By:
By Peter Galuszka in Moscow


On election day, voters thronged to the brick school building that served
as the voting place in precinct 1465--a working-class Moscow neighborhood.
One of the voters favoring the Communists--the big winners--was 83-year-old
Maria Artshenava. In her youth, the Communists brought stability and pride,
she said. Today's market reformers have brought only pain. With a pension
of only $45 a month, ``all I can buy is bread,'' she complained.
   For the second time in two years, Russian voters have given President
Boris Yeltsin the same message: Reforms have enriched just a sliver of
Russian society while impoverishing the rest. At the same time, Russia's
superpower status, achieved under the old regime, has collapsed. That's why
voters made the revived Communist Party the leaders, with 22% of the
parliamentary vote. Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's misnamed
Liberal Democratic Party did better than predicted, coming in second.
   It is certainly a disappointing outcome for Yeltsin and the whole reform
camp. But it is not quite a disaster. Indeed, Yeltsin will even find some
encouraging nuggets in the results as he ponders his strategy for the far
more important June presidential elections. Yeltsin hasn't yet declared
whether he will be a candidate in that crucial vote, which will choose a
leader for a five-year term.
FALLING FLAT. As he mulls his options, the Russian President will note with
satisfaction that the parliamentary elections have not produced a
charismatic challenger for the presidency. Grigory Yavlinski, the only
reformer with much popularity, gained just 9% of the votes. Yeltsin's most
feared rival, Alexander Lebed, the nationalist former general, fell flat on
his face. His party received less than the 5% minimum for parliamentary
representation.
   While Yeltsin will face a strong campaign from the resurgent Communists,
their leader, Gennady Zyuganov, is a bumbling-professor type who lacks
charisma. Says Nikolai Petrov, a senior analyst at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace in Moscow: ``This does improve Yeltsin's chances.
There's danger from the Communists and nationalists, but he'll get a chance
to mobilize the democratic electorate.''
   The big question is Yeltsin's health. If he is able to run in June, he
will likely enjoy the heavy backing of the financial and business groups
his policies have enriched as well as the old military and industrial
elite. But if he takes himself out of the race, the reformers could
split--opening the way for Zyuganov or Zhirinovsky.
   There is also concern that the Communist resurgence may frighten Yeltsin
into abandoning his relatively austere economic program. Such a move could
be self-defeating if inflation, which he has chopped from 2,000% in 1992 to
around 170% for 1995, shoots up again.
   But Yeltsin should be able to hold the line on reform. Although the
Communists are likely to pick up at least 150 of the Duma's 450 seats and
Zhirinovsky did surprisingly well, with more than 50 members, the
President's powers are much greater than those of the Duma. Moreover, any
Communist effort to roll back reform will be hurt by the poor showing of
their allies, the Agrarians, a group led by collective farm managers, who
dread privatization of agriculture. They only won about 20 seats. Finally,
the Communists and Zhirinovsky disagree on economics. The otherwise erratic
Zhirinovsky tends to support sound fiscal policies.
   Yeltsin is not acting as if he's going to cave in to his rivals. Moscow
insiders say he will likely ditch unpopular Foreign Minister Andrey V.
Kozyrev. But key aides such as Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and
privatization chief Anatoly Chubais are likely to stay on.
   If Yeltsin can hang on until June, he may be helped by real economic
improvement. With inflation down and the ruble relatively stable, the
indications are that economic output is likely to rise in 1996 for the
first time in six years. Russians are no longer seeing their savings eaten
away to the degree they were two years ago. By June, they may see more
Russian goods on the shelves and perhaps more competitive pricing. While
such changes may not win the votes of big losers such as Maria Artshenava,
they could be enough to gain Yeltsin another five years.

NO SMOKE, BUT PLENTY OF HEAT
Why the smokeless tobacco biz is starting to hack

By:
By Tim Smart, with Ed Brown, in New Haven


For years, UST Inc. has chewed up the competition and spit out pure gold.
Partly because the Greenwich (Conn.) maker of Skoal and Copenhagen brand
snuffs has avoided the political and legal hassles that have plagued
cigarette companies, it has posted profit numbers most consumer-products
outfits can only dream about. Earnings have doubled in five years, to $387
million last year--enough to generate a hefty 32% net margin on $1.2
billion in sales.
   Now, UST may be about to get chewed up. A study released on Dec. 18 by
the American Health Foundation, a Valhalla (N.Y.) organization that focuses
on research about the health hazards of tobacco, found that a single can of
smokeless tobacco contains three times the dosage of cancer-causing
chemicals found in a pack of cigarettes. (The average user of smokeless
tobacco consumes three cans per week.) In Kansas, a team of lawyers is
preparing a nationwide class action alleging that UST and others have known
for years that their products are addictive and harmful. Meanwhile, tobacco
has until Jan. 2 to respond to Food & Drug Administration proposals that
would sharply curtail marketing of smokeless tobacco.
TRIPLE WHAMMY. Perhaps more ominously, UST's fundamental business is
changing for the worse. Analysts expect profits to increase by 11% in 1996,
but much of the rise will come from higher prices. Unit-sales growth for
UST's smokeless tobacco through the first nine months of this year was a
paltry 0.5%--after increases of 2.6% in 1994 and 2.3% in 1993 and twice
those rates in the 1980s. From about 90% in the late 1980s, UST's market
share has fallen to about 84%.
   The problem: UST's traditional market of mostly young blue-collar males
isn't expanding. Attempts to lure new buyers to smokeless tobacco--mainly
former cigarette smokers or younger users--have failed. Competitors,
meanwhile, have begun chipping away at UST. Swisher International Inc.'s
Helme unit offers its Silver Creek brand in a two-for-one package, while
Conwood Co. is selling its new Cougar brand for about half the price of
UST's Skoal.
   UST is fighting back, but slowly. It recently unveiled Skoal Flavor
Packs, a pouch-like version of Skoal designed as an alternative to
cigarettes. But similar products have had only limited success with their
target market: cigarette smokers. Meanwhile, Joseph R. Taddeo, head of
UST's tobacco unit, resigned in June after a dispute with CEO Vincent A.
Gierer Jr.--analysts say over the course of new-product initiatives.
Taddeo's replacement is marketing executive Robert D. Rothenberg. Gierer,
Rothenberg, and other company executives refused interview requests.
   Analysts expect Rothenberg to further shift UST's advertising emphasis
away from stock-car racing and rodeo audiences to rock concerts and college
campuses. Advertising spending is going up, too. One splashy promotion is
UST's Rock The Smokies campaign, which offers a drawing for free tickets to
a country-music concert to be held on Fourth of July weekend in Newport,
Tenn. Anyone who sends in a coupon can ask for free samples of UST
products.
   But aggressive marketing could easily ignite more opposition from
activists and regulators. ``Statistics show that it's young people that
start using tobacco, not adults,'' says Mitchell R. Zeller, a deputy
associate commissioner at the FDA. ``It's the President's goal that the
next generation grow up without becoming addicted to tobacco.'' The new FDA
rules would limit marketing efforts such as sponsorships and the handing
out of free samples. The agency also is likely to pressure UST and stores
to ensure that they don't sell to minors.
I.D., PLEASE? Some states aren't waiting for Washington. In October,
Massachusetts forced UST to consent to stringent restrictions on the use of
mail-order samples there, including checking driver's licenses to verify
the age of those writing in for samples. This came after a six-month sting
in which the state had minors clip coupons in Rolling Stone and other
magazines, then write for free samples after claiming to be adults. ``If
you could fill out a coupon and sign something without showing any proof of
age and get a six-pack of beer in the mail, people would be outraged,''
says Assistant Attorney General George Weber.
   Diversification would seem prudent at this point. UST got into
winemaking in the mid-1980s under the Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia
Crest labels, but wine still only accounts for 7% of sales and 1.3% of
operating profits, hardly enough to offset pressures on its main business.
UST may have to come up with something else--or endure some bites into its
peerless financial record.

WILL FLIPPER PLAY IN ESTONIA?
Why John Kluge is on a buying binge in Hollywood

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles


John W. Kluge didn't get to be one of the richest men in America by being
stupid. A onetime Ford assembly-line worker, he invested in a Washington
radio station in 1946 and later a string of TV stations. That made his
fortune in a big way in 1984, when he sold the TV stations to Rupert
Murdoch for $2 billion. He was among the first to jump into cellular,
too--picking up a cell-phone operation in 1983, which he sold three years
later for a cool $1.6 billion.
   Yet for all his lucrative dealmaking, the 81-year-old Kluge has never
managed to conquer Hollywood. He has lost an estimated $275 million on
Orion Pictures Corp., the production outfit he began investing in during
the mid-1980s--only to see it sink into bankruptcy. Orion emerged from
Chapter 11 in 1992, but it still gushes red ink. So why would Kluge's
Metromedia International Group Inc. swoop in on Dec. 21 to bid $115 million
for debt-plagued Samuel Goldwyn Co.? Or, among other apparently oddball
deals, agree on Nov. 30 to pay an estimated $533 million for Alliance
Entertainment Corp., a distributor of golden-oldie music by the likes of
Mel Torme and Rosemary Clooney? The answer: Eastern Europe.
PICK OF SHOWS. Since the Berlin Wall came down, Kluge and his aides have
been aggressively buying up licenses to provide wireless cable TV, radio,
and telephones in such places as Riga, Tallinn, and Nizhny Novgorod. Now,
Kluge's troops are hustling to line up the programming they intend to sell
to these new customers. If it outbids Dutch media giant Polygram for the
Samuel Goldwyn studio, Metromedia will gain the rights to a library of
1,100 films, including such classics as Guys and Dolls and Pride of the
Yankees, as well as some 700 episodes of TV programs such as Flipper and
Gentle Ben.
   Will they line up in Estonia to see Flipper? Hard to say. But Kluge and
company certainly think so. In a flurry of deals since August, 1994,
Metromedia has also snapped up two smallish film companies. If you add in
Orion and Goldwyn, the deals would give Metromedia rights to more than
2,100 films and television shows.
   One problem: Much of Kluge's new empire isn't making any money. In a
recent filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, Metromedia
acknowledged that its collection of companies lost $51.2 million in the
first six months of 1995, on sales of $179.9 million. Moreover, the company
is clogged with $399 million in short-term and long-term debt.
   Kluge isn't talking about how he intends to turn his money-losers
around. And he shows no sign of altering his strategy. Associates say
Metromedia continues to bid for licenses not only in Eastern Europe but
also in Asia. The company already ships such U.S. programs as MTV, Country
Music Television, and the Discovery Channel to wireless cable-TV
subscribers in such cities as Moscow, Bucharest, and Tashkent. It also owns
radio stations in Moscow, Budapest, and elsewhere, and is building wireless
phone systems in other regions.
   Looking for financial stability, last April Kluge merged Metromedia with
Actava Group Inc., a mishmash of companies formerly known as Fuqua
Industries. Its chairman, John D. Phillips, is a 52-year-old turnaround
specialist who has sold off everything but Actava's Snapper Power Equipment
unit. An executive whose tastes run to denim and Harley Davidsons, Phillips
will act as CEO of Kluge's entertainment companies from from Actava's
Atlanta headquarters.
   As a source of new programming, Kluge is counting on Motion Picture
Corp. of America (MPCA), a production house he agreed on Nov. 27 to buy for
$32.5 million in stock and cash. MPCA, which produced such low-budget hits
as Dumb and Dumber and Threesome, plans to turn out 14 to 16 films next
year for Metromedia. If Metromedia wins Goldwyn, which specializes in art
films such as The Madness of King George, it would get ownership of a dozen
other films in the works, including American Buffalo with Dustin Hoffman.
   Can a library of movies and some startup production help put Kluge's
entertainment biz in the black? Possibly. More likely, they will keep him
in the game long enough to make back the losses from his Orion debacle--and
find another, bigger company to buy him out. After all, some of John
Kluge's shrewdest moves have come from knowing when to sell.



KLUGE'S MEDIA EMPIRE

ORION PICTURES Has a film library of 1,200 movies, including Platoon,
Terminator, and Silence of the Lambs. Emerged from bankruptcy in late 1992.
Lost $18.9 million on $73 million in revenues for the six months ended Aug.
31.

METROMEDIA INTERNATIONAL Provides wireless cable TV, paging, and telephone
services to Eastern Europe and former Soviet-bloc nations. Lost $13.1
million on $3.3 million in sales for the first six months of fiscal 1996.

SAMUEL GOLDWYN* Owns a 52-theater chain and a library of 1,100 films,
including Pride of the Yankees and Guys and Dolls, and 700 TV episodes. It
also has film production and distribution. Lost $12.3 million on sales of
$53.5 million in the six months ended Sept. 30.

THE NAACP BETS ON A NEW BREADWINNER
Kweisi Mfume hopes to show donors the crisis is over

By:
By Susan B. Garland in Washington


Last March, officials of the scandal-plagued National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People asked members of the AT&T Foundation to lunch
at Manhattan's Remi restaurant. Myrlie Evers-Williams, who had just taken
over as NAACP chair, quickly got down to business. What could the nation's
venerable civil rights organization do to persuade the foundation to renew
a three-year, $225,000 education grant that had expired in 1993? AT&T's
answer: Put your house in order. ``We were looking for strong leadership,
strong financial controls, and a strong mission,'' recalls Milton J.
Little, an AT&T Foundation vice-president who was at the meeting.
   Enter Representative Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.). On Feb. 15, Mfume will leave
Congress to become president and CEO of the NAACP, a move that figures to
bolster its clout--and its bottom line. Already, his appointment may have
won over one big donor: On Dec. 28, Nissan Motor Corp. USA is expected to
announce it will donate $100,000 to the NAACP. The organization's backers
hope others will follow. ``We wanted someone whose integrity was
first-rate,'' says Nancy L. Lane, director of corporate affairs for Johnson
& Johnson, who served on the NAACP's search committee.
DAUNTING TASK. Mfume's challenges are twofold: He must attract young blacks
now drawn to militant leaders like Louis Farrakhan while reassuring
Corporate America that the NAACP is worthy of support. ``We need to change
the hearts, minds, and direction of young people so that they see
appreciation of work, respect for elders, and individual responsibility as
bedrock principles,'' he says.
   Mfume thinks this message of self-reliance will appeal to donors. ``I
hope corporate partners who have not shied away will say to others that
it's all right to come home to the NAACP,'' he says. The task is daunting.
The 87-year-old organization has been reeling since August, 1994, when it
ousted Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. after discovering he had
paid $300,000 to settle a sexual-harassment suit. Auditors found other
evidence of gross financial mismanagement. The scandal led to longtime
Chairman William F. Gibson's defeat last February to Evers-Williams.
   Mfume is meeting with auditors to come up with fiscal controls for the
group, which is $3.8 million in debt. He hopes to build a $150 million
endowment by 2001, improve efficiencies by merging regional offices, and
ask some suppliers to restructure or forgive debt.
   Business, which contributed almost half of the NAACP's 1995 budget of
$8.5 million, is key to his efforts. Despite financial disarray, many
companies, including Procter & Gamble, Sears, Quaker Oats, and IBM, have
kept up support. Companies argue that business has an interest in backing
groups that promote minority opportunities. ``It's important we have a
skilled and qualified workforce,'' says Eric R. Graves, manager of
constituency affairs at Texaco Inc.
   Other corporate donors couldn't ignore the disorder. In 1995, corporate
giving declined some 30% from 1994. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. withheld
its annual $50,000 grant in 1994 and 1995. Seagram spokeswoman Patsy Glazer
says the company had been waiting to see who would head the organization.
Now, she wants to meet with Mfume. Merrill Lynch & Co. also is withholding
support until it sees how the NAACP's game plan shapes up. AT&T is waiting,
too, but Little is hopeful: ``We believe Mr. Mfume's leadership is what is
needed.''
SALES TOUR. Backers say Mfume proved his leadership mettle as a member of
the House Banking Committee. There, he emerged as a consensus-builder,
mediating disputes among the banking, insurance, and securities industries.
Says Banking Committee Chairman James A. Leach (R-Iowa): ``There are some
people who think that what's good for the free market is bad for
lower-income people. Kweisi believes the reverse--that what makes the
market work will be better for lower-income people.''
   That philosophy is behind Mfume's plans to set up NAACP mentoring
programs to match students with corporate volunteers. He also wants to work
with companies to set up apprenticeship programs and with officials to
improve public schools. He may also push for incentives to encourage
corporations to work with small minority companies.
   Over the next few weeks, Mfume intends to embark on a nationwide tour to
meet with corporate leaders. But with the NAACP's programs barely
functioning, many branch offices virtually closed, and one-third of its
staff on furlough, the organization could be a tough sell. It will take all
of Mfume's skills as bridge-builder to convince Corporate America that the
NAACP won't be just another bad investment on corporate books.

REPACKAGING THE POST OFFICE
Facilities are getting face-lifts, clerks are getting friendlier

By:
By Mark Lewyn in Washington


When retired CIA analyst William R. Dodge stopped at Furr's supermarket in
Albuquerque on Dec. 22, his shopping list included butter, chocolate chips,
nuts, and postage stamps. Stamps? Sure. Overnight delivery, too. The
Albuquerque facility is one of eight that the U.S. Postal Service recently
has tucked inside popular retail outlets around the country.
   The new offices are just one sign that the USPS is trying to reinvent
itself. Aside from opening facilities in outlets such as Furr's and Kmart,
it is sprucing up old offices and improving customer service.
Stamps--including new, self-adhesive ones--can now be purchased at ATMs, by
phone, and with credit cards. During the holidays, sales clerks directed
traffic and branch hours were extended. Workers even dressed as Santa to
deliver Express Mail.
   Why the changes? After all, the agency is flush from last year's rate
hike, higher mail volume, and better cost controls and cash management.
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon says he ended fiscal 1995 with a record
surplus of $1.77 billion on revenue of $54.3 billion. But in many markets,
the Postal Service is losing out to private carriers and new technologies
such as fax machines (chart). ``We just can't sit here and say to people,
`Here are our hours and, if you feel like it, bring your mail to us,'''
says Runyon. ``We need to get [market share] back.''
   The new approach was evident over the holidays. Runyon hired 40,000
part-time workers to sort mail, leased 116 planes to carry it, and set up a
command center in Washington to make sure it got through. The effort seems
to have worked: On Dec. 20, 1995's busiest mail day, the service delivered
a record 725 million pieces of mail, up 6% from 1994.
   To publicize the reforms, Runyon hiked his ad budget 50% in 1995, to
$143 million. Last fall, he also hired Loren E. Smith, a former Citibank
executive who did stints at Kraft General Foods Inc. and Colgate-Palmolive
Co., to oversee marketing.
   At the heart of the new strategy are the new postal ``stores.'' So far,
200 of the 40,000 local offices have had face-lifts that include attractive
lighting and salesclerks trained to be friendly and helpful. It's looking
good: On average, the new shops have posted 20% sales gains over the
offices they replaced. Now, Smith is stepping up the pace--all postal
facilities in Albuquerque and Atlanta are getting makeovers. Philadelphia;
Columbus, Ohio; Boston; and Richmond, Va., are next. New services include
phone debit cards and a ``Pack-and-Send'' wrapping service.
   Shoppers who endured surly postal service and long lines over the
holidays likely are skeptical of such reforms. But Runyon knows he has to
make the strategy work--or see a lot less mail with a USPS postmark.

A HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDER
This breakthrough may be the key to a fat pill

By:
By Geoffrey Smith in Boston

Last July, Amgen Inc. looked like it had a lock on one of the drug
industry's most heated races: the search for a ``fat drug.'' In a
much-heralded study whose announcement boosted Amgen's stock by $900
million, researchers disclosed that a protein called leptin, produced by
the newly discovered OB gene, stripped away body fat when injected into
obese mice.
   Barely five months later, an Amgen rival may have taken the lead: On
Dec. 28, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., was to
announce that it had found the ``receptor'' for leptin--the structure on
cell walls that is a crucial part of regulating leptin's function.
Receptors don't make anyone skinny, but many drugs target receptors to
inhibit or stimulate a bodily function. While Amgen is testing an
injectable drug, Millennium says its receptor may be the key to an
antiobesity pill, which would be far more lucrative.
MIND-SET. Researchers had hoped a shortage of leptin--the protein that
signals the brain to stop eating--was a big factor in obesity. But studies
now show that obese people often have high leptin levels. Millennium
believes the receptor it found will lead it to another obesity gene, called
DB, that determines whether the brain can recognize leptin's stop-eating
signal. ``The receptor may lead to drugs for potentially the most prevalent
form of human obesity--one resulting from the brain's resistance to leptin
rather than the lack of leptin,'' says Millennium CEO Mark Levin.
   Weight-watchers shouldn't rethink New Year's resolutions yet:
Researchers say a wonder drug is years away.

EXHALE BLOWS 'EM AWAY

By:
EDITED BY THANE PETERSON
By Ronald Grover

Call it a Christmas miracle. No one was more surprised than execs at
Twentieth Century Fox when its Waiting to Exhale opened on Dec. 22 and
immediately became the unexpected hit of the holidays. Fox had targeted its
marketing for the film, starring singer Whitney Houston and three other
black actresses, heavily at black women. Exhale opened primarily in large
cities; the studio hardly even opened the movie in the 'burbs until after
Christmas.
Hollywood isn't sure why, but despite its segmented marketing and limited
distribution, Exhale is knocking 'em dead. The film, based on a novel by
Terry McMillan, was made on a budget of $15 million, about half the
Hollywood average. In its opening weekend, the movie had a huge $14.3
million box office, beating out six other new films, including Warner
Bros.' Grumpier Old Men and Universal Pictures' Sudden Death. Being one of
the few women-oriented films helped. Whatever other reasons for Exhale's
success, Hollywood won't ignore the lesson: Look for a wave of black-female
buddy movies --glitzier, big-budget ones.

A TRUNKFUL OF PINK SLIPS AT BUDGET

WITH THE RENTAL CAR BUSIness wrapping up one of its worst years ever,
Budget Rent a Car's new chairman, Jack Frazee, had a Grinch-like holiday
message for 500 salaried employees: Your services are no longer needed.
Frazee hopes to save $20 million annually by cutting 20% of the salaried
workforce. The cuts are part of a massive shakeup at Budget, the No.3
rental agency with estimated 1995 U.S. revenues of $1.5 billion. Frazee
also showed the door to his CFO and two senior vice-presidents and closed
40 unprofitable offices. Handing out pink slips over the holidays was ``not
fun,'' Frazee says. ``But I try to remind the people who are left that the
company is a lot more stable as a result of the actions we've taken.''

Petroleum on Dec. 23 signed a five-year deal with Sonatrach, Algeria's

ARTHUR LEVITT SPEAKS SOFTLY AND CARRIES A LITTLE STICK

By:
EDITED BY DOUGLAS HARBRECHT
By Amy Barrett, with Michael Schroeder

When President Clinton unexpectedly vetoed a securities-litigation reform
bill on Dec. 19, it marked a setback for Securities & Exchange Commission
Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. The SEC chief had toiled for months to forge a
compromise that satisfied Republicans' desire to curb nuisance suits and
the Administration's insistence on protection for small investors. Congress
overrode the veto, but the debacle dealt a blow to Levitt's dream of
becoming a consensus-builder able to bridge the gulf on Capitol Hill.
   Because the veto blindsided GOP lawmakers, Levitt comes off looking
ineffectual. White House pols seeking favor with the trial lawyers' lobby
swayed the President, rather than Levitt. And Levitt's O.K. of a
``safe-harbor'' section of the bill that protects companies from suits over
false projections riled consumer groups. ``Levitt's credibility has been
deeply wounded by playing politics,'' says Michael A. Calabrese, a director
of Congress Watch and an opponent of the bill.
BIT PLAYER? Levitt, 64, former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, was
viewed as a savvy regulator when Clinton appointed him in 1993. Since the
Republican takeover of Congress, he has skillfully courted GOP legislators.
His modus operandi: seizing chances to get with the Republicans'
deregulatory program. For example, after winning GOP concessions on the
safe-harbor provision of the securities-reform measure--including the
exclusion of such protection for initial public offerings--Levitt signed
off on that portion of the bill. High-tech companies with volatile stock
prices had sought the change to reduce their exposure to costly lawsuits.
   While Levitt contends he would have opposed the legislation if the
safe-harbor provision had not been modified, critics grumble that he chose
to blink rather than duke it out with Republicans. ``I was stunned,'' says
former SEC Commissioner Richard Y. Roberts, a Republican, of Levitt's
position.
   More surprising, though, was Levitt's nonrole in the President's veto
decision. Clinton relied mainly on longtime Arkansas adviser Bruce Lindsey
and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes in arriving at his no-go decision.
Levitt, for his part, insists his views were well known to the White
House.
   The perception that Levitt was a bit player in the affair could hurt
next year when the House will consider paring back securities regulations.
Rather than mounting an all-out assault on the bill's objectionable
provisions, the SEC chief is trying to win a place at the negotiating table
while pushing to eliminate overlapping state and federal regulations. Yet
with Levitt's White House clout now in question, the bill's sponsors may be
less inclined to make concessions.
   Levitt's efforts to protect his agency's funding could also take a hit.
So far, his accommodating approach has paid off. Republicans who have
savaged other regulatory agencies are expected to hold the SEC budget
steady at $300 million in 1996. But Congress could well make another run at
the regulator's budget next year, while Levitt appears weakened.
   Despite his recent wounding, Levitt shows no signs of a retreat from his
agenda. He still intends to pressure the National Association of Securities
Dealers to reform the NASDAQ market and make it more equitable for small
investors. And the SEC chief is about to unveil a proposal to require more
disclosure of derivative holdings, which could greatly complicate
companies' public filings. ``I expect flak from all quarters,'' Levitt says
serenely. But his success in dodging the next round of artillery shells may
determine the legacy Levitt leaves behind at an embattled SEC.

BUDGET SLOW BOAT

By:
EDITED BY DOUGLAS HARBRECHT

-- Protracted wrangling over the fiscal 1996 budget has dashed any chance
that President Clinton will send Congress a fiscal 1997 budget by Feb. 5,
the statutory deadline. After two government shutdowns and marathon budget
talks, the Office of Management & Budget is two months behind in its review
of agency spending proposals for the next fiscal year. The most likely
outcome: The White House may send just a letter to Congress explaining the
delay.

JAPAN'S SHADOW KINGMAKER IS BIDDING FOR THE SPOTLIGHT

By:
EDITED BY STANLEY REED
By Brian Bremner in Tokyo

Ichiro Ozawa has always preferred the role of shadow kingmaker in Japanese
politics. Back in 1993, the brash political heavyweight helped lead a mass
defection from the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party, snapping its
38-year reign. When his reformist government collapsed in 1994, Ozawa
pulled off an improbable merger of nine parties into an opposition bloc
called the New Frontier Party but didn't take the top leadership post.
   Now, Ozawa, 53, has emerged from the shadows. In mid-December, he
announced a surprise bid to challenge longtime colleague Tsutomu Hata to
lead New Frontier. And when the results were tallied on Dec. 27, Ozawa won
by more than 2 to 1. The stage is now set for an epic battle between Ozawa
and LDP President and International Trade & Industry Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in a general election sometime in 1996. At stake will be control
of the Diet's 511-seat lower house and the Prime Minister's chair.
``AS VAGUE AS POSSIBLE.'' Ozawa's bid for the spotlight is timely. After
four years of economic stagnation and a string of bank failures, the
Japanese public is fed up with the Socialist-LDP government's dysfunctional
management of the economy. Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's
coalition is coming under withering attack for a plan to use $6.6 billion
in public money to bail out seven insolvent housing-loan corporations,
which made reckless real estate loans in the 1980s. ``The intent is to be
as vague as possible about the assignment of blame,'' Ozawa told BUSINESS
WEEK. ``This is the kind of society Japan has become.''
   Ozawa wants to remake the Japanese system. He champions sweeping
deregulation. He also wants to give the now weak Prime Minister's office
enough power to set clear policy directions. Japan's glacial
consensus-style decision-making threatens to consign the nation to decline,
he warns. ``No leader has come up with a strong vision of how to go
forward,'' he says.
   Ozawa's biggest liability aside from heart problems is his association
with the money politics he says he wants to clean up. After all, he was a
key LDP fund-raiser and power broker for years. He is taking heat right now
for his ties to a Buddhist organization that turned out 6 million votes to
support Ozawa candidates in last July's Upper House elections. Ozawa's rise
could also bust up New Frontier if he can't keep Hata on board.
   Hashimoto, who made a big splash by staring down Washington in last
summer's auto talks, is much more popular than Ozawa. Still, there is
growing sentiment in Japan that Ozawa may be the only leader who can
produce significant change. ``He's very determined, and the time left for
Japan to pull out of this stagnation is limited,'' figures Masaya Miyoshi,
president of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren.
   Indeed, Ozawa has won plaudits from some economists for his proposal to
halve income and corporate taxes, wipe out special-interest loopholes, and
eventually make up some of the difference by hiking Japan's sales tax from
3% to 10%. But with Japan's budget deficit projected to hit 4.2% of gross
domestic product in 1996, vs. 2.0% in the U.S., Ozawa has to be careful not
to lead Japan into a fiscal mess.
   Ozawa could also help heal strained ties with the U.S. He is a
pragmatist on trade who is well regarded in Washington. Ozawa says he is
worried that Washington has started to lose interest in Japan. He finds it
regrettable that there is a tendency in Washington ``to treat the
U.S.-Japan alliance more lightly than before.'' If Ozawa becomes Prime
Minister, that would certainly command American attention.

PRIVATIZING A BRAZILIAN GIANT

By:
EDITED BY STANLEY REED
By Ian Katz in Sao Paulo

-- Brazil's slow-moving free-market reforms are getting a fresh impetus
from the sale of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining
giant. In what's likely to be Latin America's biggest privatization, Brazil
on Dec. 20 picked a group headed by Merrill Lynch & Co. and Rothschild Inc.
from a star-studded field of competitors to manage the sale of the
government's 51% share in CVRD. The sale, set for late 1996, should fatten
state coffers by at least $5 billion.
   Privatization of CVRD will mark ``the point of no return'' for Brazil's
move away from decades of statism, says Amaury Bier, chief economist of
Citibank in Sao Paulo. Recently, investors had been growing uneasy over the
slow pace of free-market legislation in Brazil's Congress. The naming of
the sale managers shows the government ``is serious about moving ahead,''
says Ricardo Gallo, vice-president for capital markets at Bank of Boston in
Sao Paulo.
   The Merrill Lynch group will earn a 1.9% commission on CVRD's sale
price. The lucrative job drew bids from such heavyweights as Citibank, J.P.
Morgan, and Salomon Brothers. A key issue is whether to sell the
government's shares in a global public offering or auction off operations
such as mining, forestry, and transport separately. But the choice of
Merrill Lynch, which joined with CS First Boston to manage a $3 billion
stock sale of Argentine oil company YPF in 1993, indicates that Brazil
favors privatizing CVRD through a similar high-profile public offering.

HOW TO EVALUATE TAX REFORM

This is shaping up as the year of America's great tax debate. About time.
The U.S. tax system is a mess, riddled with exemptions, deductions, and
credits that serve little purpose beyond rewarding favored constituents.
The tax system is expensive for individuals and corporations to comply
with, too.
   Tax reform is already an issue in the Presidential race. A GOP
commission headed by former Representative Jack F. Kemp will soon issue
recommendations. All the main tax-writing committees plan to hold hearings
on tax reform this year. To evaluate all the competing proposals for
overhauling the byzantine tax code, ranging from a single income-tax rate
to a national sales tax, we suggest a guide that's over 200 years old: The
Wealth of Nations. Adam Smith laid out four maxims with regard to taxes in
general: certainty, convenience of payment, economy in collection--and
equality.
   The flat tax is in the forefront of tax reform, and three of Smith's
maxims--certainty, convenience of payment, and economy in collection--would
be well served by a one-rate structure. The leading proponents of a flat
tax are Hoover Institution economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, and
their ideas powerfully shaped the flat-rate tax legislation of House
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.). Hall and Rabushka would levy a
single 19% flat rate on wages and salaries; Armey wants to get the rate as
low as 17%. There would be no deductions, though to keep the system
somewhat progressive Hall and Rabushka exempt from income taxes $16,500 for
a married couple and $4,500 a child. Capital gains, interest, and dividends
would be exempt from taxes. Businesses would lose many deductions, although
investment spending would get an immediate 100% first-year tax write-off.
Business would pay a 19% rate on total income (17% for Armey), after
deducting wages, salaries, pensions, and costs of goods and materials.
Bottom line: a highly simplified and more efficient system where income
gets taxed only once as close as possible to its source.
   Still, even with generous up-front exemptions, an all-or-nothing
one-rate tax is less progressive. In the past decade, global economic
forces have increased income inequality. Most Americans have only one major
asset to their name: the home they bought using generous tax incentives.
Losing the mortgage-interest deduction would squeeze the middle class. A
flat tax raises other questions, such as ditching charitable deductions and
the deductibility of state and local taxes while the federal government
asks charities and local governments to assume more responsibilities.
Perhaps a ``modified,'' streamlined tax approach is called for, one based
on two or three rates and allowing for a few of the most justifiable
deductions, such as charitable contributions and home-mortgage interest.
   The good news: The gale winds of creative tax reform are sweeping
Washington. Radical simplification would go a long way toward creating a
less intrusive government and a more efficient economy. But some equity
must be preserved.

DON'T TREAD ON FREE TRADE

What will the new year bring? An agreement between the White House and
Congress to slash federal deficits for the rest of the century. Inflation
will remain subdued, and since inflation powerfully influences the stock
and bond markets, investors should enjoy decent returns. And, as our 1996
Industry Outlook makes clear (page 72), the U.S. economic expansion that
began in 1991 should continue.
   Of course, as in any forecast, a lot could go wrong. One particularly
disturbing threat to continued growth lies with the virulent voices of
economic reaction--protectionists such as Pat Buchanan and the rapidly
expanding number of politicians who know better but make sympathetic noises
to garner votes. The rallying cry of today's isolationists and their fellow
travelers may be, ``no more free-trade agreements''--not with Chile nor
with anyone else. But what they are calling for, if heeded, would lead only
to slower growth. Instead, policymakers should push hard for fewer trade
barriers--and faster economic growth.
   True enough, there are losers as well as winners from freer trade. But
trade is not a zero-sum business. It's freer trade that helped slay the
inflation dragon that terrorized the U.S. economy for much of the '70s and
'80s. White-hot foreign competition is a key reason for disinflation fast
becoming the norm in the once inflation-prone U.S. economy. Trade spurs
growth by offering entrepreneurs and companies bigger markets. U.S.
companies are getting more and more of their sales overseas. Perhaps most
important, freer trade encourages the creation and spread of new
technologies and commercial ideas. In sharp contrast, steep trade barriers
can leave an economy stagnant. Look at Latin America for much of the period
after World War II--or the former Soviet Union, for that matter.
   Isolationists are far more powerful in Europe and Japan than they are in
the U.S. Many developing nations are still maneuvering to boost exports
while protecting their home market, too. It is more important than ever
that the world's remaining superpower provide free-trade leadership. In the
tumultuous period following the end of the cold war, the most important
decision made by the Bush and Clinton Administrations and Congress was to
continue the free-trade policies America has championed since 1945. This
bet has paid enormous economic dividends in the 1990s. The bounty from
trade and stronger economic ties among nations is plentiful indeed.

NEWBORN BABIES, BAWLING MOMS
They want laws to make insurers pay for longer hospital stays

By:
By Keith H. Hammonds in New York, with bureau reports


It is likely the most reviled fiat in recent medical history: 24 hours
after childbirth, mother and baby are out the hospital door, cut off by
their insurer. ``So negligent,'' says Kathy Sargent, an expectant mother in
Westport, Conn. ``Appalling,'' says Randi Curran of San Francisco, who will
give birth this spring. ``It must be men who made up this policy.''
   Managed care has met the masses--and the masses aren't happy. Perhaps
40% of newborns currently are discharged after one day, say hospitals,
twice the number in 1990. The economics driving that shrinkage are
compelling: Childbirth is by far the most common reason Americans enter
hospitals, and reducing stays would save insurers hundreds of millions of
dollars a year. Most mothers, though, would rather stay put, and doctors
don't want medical decisions taken out of their hands. The result is ``a
rallying point for people who have bad feelings about managed care,'' says
Michael A. Maffetone, CEO of University Hospital at Stony Brook, N.Y.
STATEHOUSE ACTION. The outrage has found an outlet: In 1996, 25 states are
expected to introduce legislation that would require insurers to pay for a
48-hour inpatient stay for normal deliveries when a physician prescribes
it. Five already have passed such laws. In California, where
health-maintenance organizations pioneered the one-day stay years ago,
insurer pressure to reduce postpartum stays to 12 hours has legislators
promising a bill on Governor Pete Wilson's desk in January. Senator Bill
Bradley (D-N.J.) is amassing support for similar federal legislation.
   In this debate, pure medicine may be on the insurers' side. While some
doctors and hospitals say they're seeing more cases of jaundice and
dehydration in newborns, the hospital readmission rate for babies remains
around its traditional 2%. Several studies have found no link between
one-day stays and consequent complications. ``There is virtually no
clinical evidence that there's a technical medical necessity for an acute
medical stay of more than 24 hours,'' says A. Bruce Campbell, chief medical
officer at Aetna Health Plans.
   Insurers and HMOs have joined with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
groups such as the American College of Nurse-Midwives to battle
minimum-stay legislation. Many hospitals, too, worry that government
remedies, while intended to give doctors and patients decision-making
power, risk setting a precedent for wide-ranging regulation of medical
practices--or simply will force insurers to cut compensation elsewhere.
   Some hospitals have devised an alternative solution: A growing number
are offering to absorb the cost of a second night's stay for mothers whose
insurers don't pay. Hospital executives say they're motivated primarily by
safety concerns, but they admit the attending publicity doesn't hurt. ``I
will not lie,'' says T.J. Padden, administrator at Box Butte General
Hospital, a 44-bed facility in rural Alliance, Neb. ``It's not a bad
marketing thing.'' Incremental costs for additional nights are low--rarely
more than $200 a night, and far lower at Box Butte. Stony Brook, the first
hospital to underwrite longer stays, says its maternity admissions are up
8% in the past six months.
FLAT FEES? The downside to this approach, say other hospital executives, is
that it ultimately could weaken their negotiating power with insurers:
Eating the cost on one procedure could encourage HMOs to cut back on
others. For now, though, the commotion may be gaining the desired effect.
Hospitals that pay for a second night say some insurers have quietly agreed
to foot the bill when patients so desire--although just one company,
Independence Blue Cross and Pennsylvania Blue Shield, has publicly
announced such a retreat.
   Ultimately, managed care likely will offer a different solution.
Insurers are starting to compensate hospitals on a flat-fee basis for many
procedures, much as Medicare does, rather than negotiating per diem rates.
As that happens, providers will take on some of the financial risk of
giving care--but also much of the decision-making power. The 24-hour stay
may yet survive, but it won't be on managed care's head.

THE WEEK AHEAD

Due to the prolonged Washington shutdown, all government release dates are
certain to be postponed.

NAPM SURVEY
Tuesday, Jan. 2, 10 a.m. -- The National Association of Purchasing
Management's business activity index probably rose to 47.8% in December,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MMS
International, one of The McGraw-Hill Companies. That low reading suggests
that the industrial sector was struggling in December. For the previous
four months, the NAPM index slid below the 50% mark that signals a
shrinking factory sector. The index was 46.5% in November.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING
Tuesday, Jan. 2, 10 a.m. -- The MMS survey expects that construction
outlays probably dropped by about 0.5% in November, after jumping 2.7% in
October. Following a surge in October, spending on public-works projects
likely fell back in November.

NEW HOME SALES
Wednesday, Jan. 3, 10 a.m. -- New single-family homes probably sold at an
annual rate of 675,000 in November, little changed from the 673,000 sales
rate in October, says the MMS report. Home buying has declined for three
consecutive months, but lower mortgage rates in 1996 could stabilize home
sales in the first quarter.

FACTORY INVENTORIES
Thursday, Jan. 4, 10 a.m. -- Factory inventories probably grew by about
0.3% in November, after a 0.4% gain in October. That's suggested by the
small increase in factory output for the month.

EMPLOYMENT
Friday, Jan. 5, 8:30 a.m. -- The MMS median forecast calls for a gain of
125,000 new nonfarm jobs in December, less than the 166,000 added in
November. However, the survey also calls for manufacturing jobs to rise by
15,000, the first increase since August. The unemployment rate probably
stood at 5.6% last month, unchanged from November's rate.

HEALING THE SOIL IN A LUSH VALLEY...BUT JUST IN TIME FOR AN URBAN FLOOD?

arbors, peeling off dead bark and looking underneath. During the spring,
Turesca released test tubes of mealybug parasites among the 20 hectares of
vineyards he farms. He'll probably save money by using parasites instead of
pesticides to combat mealybugs, which are the worst enemies of grape
plants. And he'll make the Aconcagua Valley a healthier place.
   Why is Turesca phasing out pesticides when neither chemical-free diets
nor environmentalism are exactly at the forefront of national debate in
Chile? His agricultural muse is Maria Helena Moreira, an exuberant
51-year-old Brazilian economist who put a successful academic career on
hold to start Aconcagua Verde, an ambitious project that aims to minimize
pollution while maximizing production in this lush valley 100 kilometers
east of Santiago. Moreira, with backing from the MacArthur Foundation in
the U.S., is looking to spark a mini-revolution in the Aconcagua. ``If we
succeed, this will be the only valley in Chile that will be able to produce
large-scale in an environmentally friendly way,'' says Moreira.
   Fruit is big business in Chile. Exports equaled 18% of gross domestic
product in 1994 and have been rising in 1995. The Aconcagua, always an
agricultural area, really started booming some 20 years ago, when Chile
tore down its trade barriers. Now, nearly 70% of the valley's irrigable
land--some 35,000 hectares--is devoted to export fruit production, more
than half of it in table grapes.
   But while exports have skyrocketed, the soil has suffered, admits
Claudio Garcia, Aconcagua Valley manager for Chiquita Exportadoras Ltda.
``There's a lot of natural degradation--the soil is heavily worked by
machines and people, so it has become much less porous.'' Then there are
pesticides. Like most grape farmers, Turesca has to abide by exporters'
rules. The exporters are in turn bound by the rules of importers--mostly
the U.S.--which require that fruit be 100% pest-free. Many farmers spray
fruit with twice as many pesticides as necessary just to make sure.
   The ravages of grape monoculture began to bother Moreira during a visit
she made to Chile in 1990. Late that year, she applied, along with
sociologists and scientists from the University of California and the
University of Rio, to the MacArthur Foundation for an
international-cooperation grant. The project: to study the effects of
monoculture on the valley and figure out how to grow fruit with less damage
to the soil. A tall order for $500,000, but that's how much Moreira was
awarded in 1991, when she and a team of professors began surveying local
farmers and exporters. In November, 1995, the project was handed over to
the town of Los Andes, but Moreira has stayed on.
   So far, only a handful of producers are using Aconcagua Verde's methods,
but this is just the first year. Garcia expects the numbers to grow: ``I
would imagine that costs will drop as productivity rises,'' which happens
as soil regains its health.
   Moreira and her crew recommend that farmers let certain weeds grow under
their arbors to prevent erosion. What controls the weeds? Geese. ``They do
the mowing--and we plan to start a side business selling down for sleeping
bags and quilts,'' she says.
   When a Basque dandy bought the Aconcagua Valley in the 19th century, his
plan was to cut a mule route to Argentina through the middle of it. The
plan didn't take hold, but a century and a half later the concept of the
valley as a throughway is coming back. The main road from Santiago is going
to be widened, which will halve travel time to 45 minutes, a tempting
thought for smog-sick city dwellers longing to escape. Residential plots
are now selling for four times as much as they would as farmland.
   A proposed tunnel from Argentina could also threaten the valley's
agricultural future. Chile's congress is considering carving a tunnel
through the Andes that would serve as a bridge between the Pacific and the
Atlantic. The resulting commercial and residential development ``would doom
the valley in terms of agriculture,'' says Moreira. Cars, not
contamination, could be the valley's biggest threat.

INVESTMENT FIGURES OF THE WEEK

COMMENTARY
As the stock market's best year in two decades drew to a close, investors
took profits. After reaching a high of 5216.5 on Dec. 13, the Dow
industrials fell as low as 5059 and then rebounded to 5106 on Dec. 27. As
expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates, but that
didn't count for much with bond buyers, who instead focused on the budget
impasse between President Clinton and the GOP-controlled Congress. Looking
abroad, the long-ailing Japanese and Mexican stock markets staged yearend
rallies.

GLOOMY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
DEPARTMENT STORES SHOW PROMISE, BUT SLUGGISH SALES COULD SINK MANY
MERCHANTS

By:
By Susan Chandler in Chicago

Consumer confidence is up, and the stock market is at record highs. But
instead of merchants expect a Darwinian shakeout in 1996. "The strong are
getting stronger. The weak are disappearing or consolidating," says Arthur
C. Martinez, chairman and chief executive of Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   Many retailers have reason to be gloomy. Retail sales rose only 4.5%
during 1995, far below the 7% annual growth common during the roaring
1980s. They're expected to rise by the same 4.5% in 1996, while profits
will remain restrained by heavy discounting.
   Roughly 15,000 retail companies sought protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court by late 1995, pushing Chapter 11 filings up 20% from 1994.
Retail economists expect even more in 1996 (chart). That's because this
latest round of financial troubles isn't just from taking on too much debt.
It's concentrated among regional retailers with outdated computer systems,
yesterday's merchandise, and aging stores. For many, liquidation may be the
only answer, says Carl E. Steidtmann, chief economist of Management
Horizons, a consulting unit of Price Waterhouse based in Columbus, Ohio.
   The trouble is, consumers just aren't spending much. Incomes are fairly
stagnant, and consumers' non-mortgage debt-to-income ratio hit an all-time
high of 19% in late 1995. What's more, baby boomers are paying more for
services, from child- to elder-care leaving them less for shopping. And
consumers have discovered that they can get hefty discounts by waiting for
sales. "Now that we've taught them to do that, we shouldn't sit around and
wonder why," says John Ronzetti vice-president of the National Retail
Federation.
KMARTS CONSTRACTION. Discounters are feeing a lot of pain. A raft of
regional chains, including Bradlees Inc, and Caldors Corp., sought Chapter
11 protection in 1995 as competition from fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and Target Stores intensified. The shakeout many even claim Kmart Corp.,
the nation's third-largest retailer, retail expects say. Kmart CEO Floyd
Hall, who replaced the ousted Joseph E. Antonini in June, says he will
close 70 stores in 1996, cut $300 million in costs, and continue to unload
inventory. 'The best answer to Chapter 11 [talk] is to have a solid
performance under our belt," he says.
   Easier said than done. Just ask specialty retailers, who are expecting
another drab year for apparel sales. Clothing sales are expected to grow
only 3.5% in 1996 after a 2.5% increase in 1995. St. Louis-based Edison
Brothers Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 in November and plans to close
500 of its 2,700 mall-based shops. Ann-Taylor Stores Corp. is heading for a
makeover after suffering a double-digit tumble in same-store sales in
1995--the result of fashion and pricing miscues in an unforgiving market,
says retail consultant Alan Millstein, who publishes the New York-based
Fashion Network Report.
HITTING THE GAS. For beleaguered catalog companies, 1996 may spell a bit of
relief. Hit by higher paper and postage costs, catalogers saw their bottom
line take a beating in 1995; Lands' End Inc. profits throught October
dropped 61%. A survey of U.S. catalogers by consultant A.T. Kearney Inc.
found 62% expect sales to increase in 1996.
   Department stores should continue to slowly regain maket share from
outlet stores and off-price retailers. Lower prices--and thinner
margins--are the key. "We've had to get our costs down to offer fashion
that's also a value," says Allan Questrom, CEO of Cincinnati-based
Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
   Consumer-electronics stores are ecxpected to have another hot year, as
shoppers snap up computers and related items. That means strong revenue
growth for category killers--high-volume specialty chains such as Best Buy
Co. and Circuit City Stores Inc. But they, too, must settle for the
slimmest of margins.
   Sears seems to be getting the formula right. It's one of the last
department stores with a broad array of hard goods, such as appliances and
computers. With these products going gang-busters and its apparel share
expanding, Sears is winning market share. Says CEO Martinez: "When that
happens, you push the accelerator a little harder." But in what looks like
a treacherous 1996, many other retailers will be satisfied just to stay in
the road.



Prognosis '96

Positives
  -- Housing purchases should continue to help sales of home-related
goods.
  -- Consumer confidence is rising, and that bodes well for sales of
big-ticket items such as home computers.

Negatives
  -- Apparel sales will continue to slow as consumers focus on home-related
purchases.
  -- Retail bankruptcies will increase as the shakeout among discounters
and off-price retailers continues.
