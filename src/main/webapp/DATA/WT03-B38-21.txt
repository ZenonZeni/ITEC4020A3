ATM SURCHARGING TOP EFT ISSUE OF 1996

     Automated teller machine (ATM) surcharges will dominate the
electronic banking industry during the next 12 months, industry
experts unanimously agreed in interviews with EFT.
     Sources predict non-discriminatory ATM surcharges will be the
banking issue of 1996 as financial services providers try aggressively
to reap profits from alternative delivery methods.
     No national EFT network allowed its members to surcharge prior to
1996.  However, 14 state legislatures passed laws prohibiting such
restrictions.
     Visa's PLUS ATM network will allow its members to surcharge on
April 1, 1996, and many regional EFT networks have lifted their
surcharge bans. 
     MasterCard's Cirrus network has not lifted its surcharge ban and
a company spokesperson said it does not plan to change its position.
     The Wilmington, Del.-based MAC EFT network, the second-largest
regional network in the  country, said last month that it will allow
surcharging in 1996.

Competitive Pressure

     Many financial institutions and other third-party ATM owners such
as Plano, Texas-based EDS and Dallas-based Affiliated Computer
Services, claim they cannot support the cost of placing ATMs in low-
volume transaction areas without a surcharge.  However, consumer
groups say surcharging is just another means for banks to add to their
record profits.
     The networks receive no money from the surcharge.  Surcharge
revenue goes directly to the ATM owner.  Banks claim they need
surcharges to compete with third-party ATM owners such as EDS and
Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), which negotiate contracts with
casinos and malls.  
     Some bank executives said EDS and ACS can outbid financial
institutions for these contracts because they offer the retailers a
cut of the surcharge.
     "A lot of pressure is on banks to surcharge even if they are
philosophically opposed to it," said Joseph Pendleton III, senior vice
president of electronic banking for Wyomissing, Pa.-based Meridian
Bank.  "If they don't [surcharge], they will not be able to manage an
off-premise program with significant value."

Who Wants the Surcharges?

     The non-financial ATM owners are not so sure financial
institutions are really opposed to surcharges. 
     One ATM owner suggested banks may be hiding behind the third-
party ATM owners to avoid public outrage.
     "We are in favor of surcharging and believe it will give us the
ability to deploy more ATMs," said T.A. "Kip" Hyde Jr., a director of
EFT development for ACS.  "As far as people like us and EDS pushing
it, that is not entirely true.  Banks are learning that in off-premise
ATM sites, there is only a certain [limit] to the expenses you can
bury in marketing costs."
    ACS surcharges range from $.50 at convenience stores to $2 at
casinos in its 4,100-ATM MoneyMaker Network.  EDS charges from $.25 to
$1 at approximately 10 percent of its 5,800 ATMs, according to company
spokesperson Carol Winters.
    Consumer interest groups don't believe the claim that remote ATMs
cost too much to run.  "Banks are already able to save billions in
teller and branch costs with ATMs and they are already generating
billions in fees," said Janice Shields, a banking researcher for the
Washington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of Responsive Law (CSRL). 
"Now, we are just adding more profit to the top."
    According to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) -- an
affiliate of CSRL -- ATM transactions generated more than $2.55
billion in fees, while saving banks $2.34 billion in teller costs in
1993, the last year for which such figures have been compiled.  The
CFA claims more than $.78 in profits was generated for every dollar
collected from consumers for ATM services.
    With consumers being charged for using an ATM not owned by their
bank and then having a surcharge added on top of that, shouldn't the
industry be concerned that transaction volumes will decrease?
    The majority of the machines with surcharges exceeding $1 will be
placed in areas where the consumer desperately needs the money and
will pay for convenience, ATM owners said.  For example, highway rest
areas and casinos present prime surcharging opportunities.

A Transaction Drop?

    New Orleans-based GulfNet EFT Network has allowed its members to
levy surcharges because the Louisiana and Mississippi legislatures
overruled the mandate of the national networks.  However, Del
Tonguette, president of GulfNet, said transaction volume has not been
affected by the surcharges. 
    Nearly 87 percent of GulfNet's 4,000 ATMs carry member surcharges
and Tonguette said pricing has not been an issue.  He claims setting a
fair and equitable surcharge is easily determined by the consumer. 
ATM owners who charge too much will quickly lose transaction volume.
    "I am gratified to see at least Visa has seen the light.  One
prediction that I can make is that MasterCard and all of its
subsidiaries will follow suit," said Tonguette, who has been a staunch
proponent of surcharging.
    The MAC Network, which is owned by Wilmington, Del.-based
Electronic Payment Services (EPS), admits it is not exactly sure what
effect surcharging will have on transaction volume, but it does not
believe it will inhibit growth.
    "A lot of discussion and consideration [went into our decision],"
said Barbara Link, an EPS spokesperson.  "It is difficult to say
exactly what surcharging will mean.  Certainly, the banks would like
to have a lot of say [in determining whether surcharging is prudent]."
    Reston, Va.-based Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA)
has not taken a position on surcharging because it claims members are
divided on the topic.  Consequently, the EFTA has not lobbied any of
the national or regional networks to lift the surcharge bans.   
However, Kurt Helwig, executive director of the EFTA, said EDS has
vocally supported surcharging, while other financial institutions have
opposed it.  Helwig understands both sides of the argument:  "This is
yet another issue we cannot take a position on.  [However,] to date,
studies have shown consumers are willing to pay for convenience ...
[But] ATM owners have to be smart about pricing because the consumer is
going to decide this marketplace."

Government Intervention

    As banks begin to learn how much consumers will pay for the
convenience of remote ATM services, it appears ATM owners will not
have to worry about scrutiny from Capitol Hill.  According to Shields
of the CSRL, "consumers don't exactly have a good Congress for
[surcharge reform] now.  It is not a good legislative climate to tap
ATM fees."
    The CSRL is working with representatives in Washington to draft
legislation that would require disclosure of fees before a transaction
is completed.
    Despite the push for surcharges, fees are not the only answer to
increasing ATM installation and maintenance costs.  EDS's Winters said
ATM owners can lower their costs by offering more services, such as
stamps, event tickets, calling card vouchers and travelers checks. 
These services can require the bulk of the surcharges, while ATM
activity is left relatively untouched.  (Kurt Helwig, EFTA, 703/435-

PROPRIETARY SMART CARD PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE STEADY GROWTH IN 1996

Smart cards will continue to gain market share this year, but their
growth still will fall short of the explosion enthusiasts seek. 
Millions of smart cards will be issued this year; however, the
majority of them will be used in closed systems such as college
campuses or large business headquarters, according to Basil Bromberg,
president of Dallas-based smart-card consultancy Smart Cards USA.
    "The big open systems are all waiting for a bank to issue [smart]
cards," said Bromberg.  "Niche systems will develop more quickly. 
After that, the shared smart card will [arrive].  For instance, a
transportation industry may link with a school [identification card]
where the [bus company] can buy some of the memory on the I.D. and the
kids can use the card to pay for the bus."

Sports Stored Value

    The eyes of the financial services industry will be on the
Visa/First Union smart card pilot at the Atlanta Summer Olympics this
summer.  Visa and First Union plan to launch more than 1 million smart
cards in an open system pilot.
    Bromberg called the pilot a glorified closed project.  "It is
only a large- scale show, really," said Bromberg.  "It is an access
card.  It is nice.  It is no great brainstormer.  The trouble is that
once the Olympics are over, all you have is a souvenir."
    It is easier for the banks to see the profitability of a closed
system at this point in the smart card's development.  The bank would
make money in a proprietary system by sponsoring the transaction
handling and money transfer.
    The specialized sport stored-value card, as employed by the
National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars, will continue to gain
momentum.  The Jaguars have issued stored value cards that can only be
used inside the stadium to purchase refreshments or souvenirs.
    "That is going to take off like a rocket," said Joseph Pendleton
III, senior vice president of electronic banking at Wyomissing, Pa.-
based Meridian Bank.  (Basil Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502;

NYCE ATM NETWORK BUILDS HOME BANKING PLATFORM

The NYCE EFT network said it is ready to expand into home banking and
take advantage of the largest single opportunity for EFT transaction-
building.  As a result, it could pose a challenge to industry
mainstays MasterCard, Online Resources, Servantis and Visa.
    NYCE, the largest EFT provider in the Northeast and a subsidiary
of Hackensack, N.J.-based Infinet Payment Services, invested at least
$2 million in creating a bank-branded home banking and electronic
commerce services platform, according to NYCE President and CEO
Richard Yanek.
    The main goal of the platform is to create a single interface for
NYCE members to access customer financial institution information from
any personal financial management (PFM) software product and any
access device.
    Without NYCE or another commercial interface, if a bank wants to
allow its customers to use PFM software from Intuit's Quicken, Meca's
Managing Your Money or Microsoft Money, the institution must build a
separate interface to each vendor.  NYCE will manage the interfaces
and act as a translator so the bank's customer information will look
the same regardless of the customer's means of access.
    Three to four institutions of various sizes will begin piloting
the NYCE product in the second quarter of 1996, Yanek said.  The
product should be commercially available to NYCE's 1,200 member
institutions by the end of 1996.  
    "We tend to think of this [product] as a transporter translator,"
said Yanek.  "What comes through to the bank [is the same no matter
what the PFM software].  We already have the pipeline [to the banks]. 
And, very importantly, think of the cost of implementing such a
system.  We are spending a substantial amount of money.  But it is
minuscule compared to what an institution would have to spend
individually."
    NYCE is negotiating with "all of the providers on the market
today," Yanek said.
    New York-based MasterCard, Reston, Va.-based Online Resources,
Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis and San Francisco-based Visa started
similar home banking "translation" software in the last 12 months. 
However, Yanek claims NYCE's system will be the only one to be both
on-line and interactive.

A Change in Branding Philosophy

    All NYCE EFT products carried the NYCE brand prior to home
banking.  Yanek said NYCE has decided to allow the institutions to
brand their home banking offerings.
    "With services of this kind, the consumer is operating within the
bank.  They are working directly with the bank," said Yanek.  "Hence,
there is no need for the NYCE logo.  That contrasts with what exists
on the marketplace today.  When you sign on with Quicken, you see a
roster of all of the Quicken banks.  It is counterproductive.  When
customers sign on, they want to see or hear the name of their bank."
    What NYCE loses in name recognition, it could gain in transaction
volume and licensing fees.  
    Yanek predicts that home banking transactions will build
gradually, and by the end of the century, each home banking household
will complete approximately 24 transactions per month.  Currently,
each ATM cardholder performs an average of one transaction per month.
    In addition, NYCE plans to license and offer equity in the
product to other large EFT networks.  Yanek said preliminary
discussions have begun, but don't expect small networks to join the
home banking mix just yet.
    "Small networks will not venture unless it is free-ride," said
New Orleans- based GulfNet EFT Network President Del Tonguette. 
"Offering home banking is fine with me as long as [someone else] pays
for the expensive startup."
    Omaha, Neb.-based bill-payment provider SmartPay paid all of the
communications and hookup costs to link GulfNet member banks Hancock
Bank and Jefferson Guarantee.  The increased transaction volume at
these two banks has been negligible, according to Tonguette. 
    Tonguette, however, believes home banking will be a very small
piece of the action through the rest of this century for his company's
277 financial institution members.
    The future of home banking could be here for large networks like
NYCE.  Before creating the home banking platform, NYCE surveyed its
top 25 banks in addition to 125 other members of various sizes, asking
them to set their priorities from a list of 27 possible product
offerings.
    Home banking and bill payment services were highest on the
request list from the top 25 banks and second on the list for the
remaining banks surveyed.  At the top of their list was enhanced ATM
services.
    Financial institutions also want their customers not only to
complete conventional home banking transactions but also to have
access to financial periodicals and the Internet.
    "The reality is that [consumers and banks] are desiring something
more than home banking," said Yanek.  "A better term is 'electronic
financial commerce.'  We see a need for something more than a simple
set of transactions."  (Del Tonguette, GulfNet, 504/643-5070; Dick
Yanek, NYCE Network, 201/488-6111.)

DIEBOLD EXPANDING INTO ATM MAINTENANCE

     Diebold no longer sells only automated teller machines (ATMs). 
The Canton, Ohio-based company is producing and selling ATM management
software to avoid any loss of revenue if the ATM market becomes
saturated and profits flatten.
     Many EFT sources predict new ATM sales could decrease sharply
over the next 5 to 10 years.
     Interbold, Diebold's ATM joint venture with IBM, holds 55 percent
of the U.S. ATM market.
     Diebold took its first step into the ATM software management
arena at last month's Bank Administration Institute (BAI) Retail
Delivery Conference (RDC) in Atlanta.  Diebold and its partner,
Optical Data Systems of Richardson, Texas, have created a new
networking solution for client-server systems.
     The local area network (LAN) hub and ATM-driving software allows
banks to download programs and change ATM screens in seconds, said
Harry Bosch, Diebold business development manager.
     The system can help banks increase uptime because ATMs will not
have to be down as long for changes.  It also can save bank personnel
costs because it eliminates the need to change programs and screens by
"sneakernet" -- employees visiting each machine to load software, he
said.
    Additionally, banks can improve marketing efforts because the
system allows targeted screen changes, Bosch said.  For example, if a
bank wanted to run a promotion involving a certain chain of grocery
stores, the 50-or-so ATMs at that chain can be loaded with a
specialized screen, he added.
    In the security arena, Diebold also released an event management
system.  The software will identify ATM device failures, analyze the
situation, open a trouble ticket and determine the proper course of
action without human intervention.  It sends faxes to the owner-bank
or beeps a service representative, Bosch said.
    InterBold displayed many of its updated machines at the RDC.  The
machines can read and cash checks, print courtesy amounts and give
change.  Updated ATMs also can dispense checkbooks, stamps and
tickets.  Interbold's most advanced technology was demonstrated in its
MicroBranch, a sit-down kiosk with touch-screen monitors, dual
telephone handsets and videoconferencing.  The outside walls of the
kiosk change from clear to cloudy when occupied for privacy.
    Diebold has the right idea in enhancing and expanding its ATM
product line, said Megan Robertson, a Smith Barney analyst:  "ATMs are
commodity products, so this is a value-added product.  That's the
right stuff."
    Competitor Fujitsu ICL offers similar enhancements and AT&T's
newest machines offer coupon-printing capabilities.

S2 SYSTEMS AND ATM MONITORING

  S2 Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stratus Computer Inc.,
recently released an automated, integrated automated teller machine
(ATM) information and monitoring system (AIMS).  The system was
developed with Richardson, Texas-based ProAmerica Systems Inc.  The
two companies integrated Dallas-based S2's ON/2 electronic banking
software with ProAmerica's help desk software -- Service Call
Management (SCM).  Now, when an ATM system failure or network
breakdown occurs, ON/2 sends an alarm message to SCM.  SCM then
processes, logs and transmits the information, notifying a technician
via digital pager, fax, E-mail or voice system.  SCM also creates a
Technical Assistance Request (TAR) and records the transaction for
network and system analysis.  Using a touch-tone telephone, field
technicians can access their individual problem lists and change the
status of items, or TARs, on the lists by using personal
identification numbers assigned to each technician.  (Susan Kemp, S2
Systems, 214/458-3887.)

NEW PRODUCTS HELP BANKS INCREASE CONSUMER ACCESS

    Smart card holders now can use a portable smart card reader --
the size of a key chain -- to view balance information, according to
software and hardware supplier Oki America Inc.
    The Advanced Products Division (OAPD) of the Marlborough, Mass.-
based company released the Value Checker Balance Reader (BR).  The
personal smart card reader allows consumers to verify balances on
electronic purse smart cards or pre-paid phone cards.
    In addition, the Value Checker BR can display such other
information stored on cards as health care data, identification
numbers and electronic benefit transfer values.  The Value Checker BR
will be commercially available in the first quarter of 1996.
    The new product is an extension of Oki's Value Checker product
line.  Oki released the Value Checker Card Protector (CP) in April
1995.  (Wes Shimanek, Oki America, 508/460-8776.) 

World Wide Web Access

    Meanwhile, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Edify Corp. released its
Electronic Workforce 4.0 interactive services software product last
month.  The software allows companies to launch interactive services
quickly and cheaply via standard World Wide Web (WWW) browsers.
    Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp. already has purchased Workforce
4.0 to create and deliver interactive human resources applications for
