<p> *ZABAGLIONE,* SABAYON--A cream mousse of Italian origin which
is used to coat hot puddings but which can also be served in cups
or glasses, as a sweet. </p>

<p> [The etymology of the word deleted...] </p>

<p> Beat together in a basin 250 g. (9 oz., generous cup) sugar
and 6 egg yolks until the mixture forms a 'ribbon'. Flavour with
1 tablespoon vanilla sugar, orange, lemon or tangerine peel, or
vanilla extract. </p>

<p> Add 2(1/2) dl. (Scant (1/2) pint, generous cup) sweet or dry
white wine. Cook in a bain-marie or in a double saucepan over a
very low heat, whisking vigorously until the mixture becomes
frothy and stiff. </p>

<p> [It then continues with variations on _Zabaglion_,
including...] </p>

<p> *Zabaglione (`a) la kola,* SABAYON (`A) LA KOLA--Prepare some
_zabaglione_ using port wine. When the mixture begins to set, add
2 teaspoons of the following mixture: equal quantities of liquid
cola extract and liquid coca extract flavoured with a little
syrup made from the rind of bitter oranges. </p>

<p> This _zabaglione_, which should be eaten very hot, is not
only a very tasty dessert, but also an excellent medicine. </p>

<p> And, just to check what this &quot;coca&quot; is they're
talking about: </p>

<p> *COCA*--Peruvian shrub, the leaves of which are chewed by the
Indians. Considered an economical food, its properties are due to
the effect produced by its alkaloid, cocaine, which is as
stimulating as tea or coffee. It is used as an infusion, as a
wine, as an elixer, and also used as an ingredient of certain
cakes. </p>
