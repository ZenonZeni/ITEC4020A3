<B>Integrated Analysis of Transportation Demand Pathway Options for <br>


Hydrogen Production, Storage, and Distribution;<br>

C.E. (Sandy) Thomas, Principal Investigator,<br>

<P>

Most experts agree that hydrogen-powered vehicles could simultaneously 
reduce crude oil 

imports, urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, particularly 
if that hydrogen were 

eventually produced from renewable energy such as solar, wind, 
hydroelectric or biomass.  We 

all know the end goal, but how do we get from here to there?  How do we 
convince legislators, 

government officials, the public and particularly industry that 
hydrogen-powered vehicles can 

compete in the marketplace without government subsidy?  How do we 
construct a realistic, 

viable pathway to move from virtually total dependence on 
gasoline-powered vehicles to clean 

hydrogen vehicles?

<P>

Previous studies have independently analyzed hydrogen production, 
storage and distribution 

options, along with fuel cell vehicle technology and, to a limited 
degree, market penetration 

scenarios for hydrogen powered vehicles.  This project will integrate 
previous work into a set of 

coherent programmatic pathways that illustrate how hydrogen-powered 
vehicles can enter the 

market in substantial quantities.

<P>

Each programmatic pathway will include a computer model integrating four 
elements of the 

transportation sector: vehicle technology; hydrogen refueling 
infrastructure; market scenarios; 

and government actions.  Each segment is represented in the model by a 
time series, such as the 

price of hydrogen over time, or the number of fuel cell vehicles sold 
over time, or the amount of 

industry investment in fuel cell vehicles or hydrogen infrastructure 
over time.  The elements are 

interrelated; the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) price depends on the total 
number of vehicles 

manufactured through the previous year.  The number of FCVs sold depends 
in part on the 
price.  And price depends on government and industry investments.

<P>

The key inputs to this model are government actions, including but not 
limited to R&D 

investments, incentives, codes and standards, demonstration projects, 
and education.  The 

primary outputs are the return on investment for industry and, for 
government, the contribution 

to societal objectives of cleaner air, reduced oil imports and reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions.  

The intent of the model is to permit the DOE Program Manager to assess 
the effects of making 

government investments - by investing a relatively small amount now in 
hydrogen R&ampD, 

industry will be induced to make the much larger investments needed 
later to make fuel cell 

vehicles a reality.  

<P>

<b><I>Recent Activities:</I></b>

<P>

We completed a preliminary literature search in the three target

areas:  fuel cell vehicle technology, hydrogen infrastructure

studies, and fuel cell vehicle market penetration analysis.  We

also identified major reports on the environmental impact of fuel

cell vehicles.  A time-dependent, interactive model structure

was written that includes eight major time series from 1996 to

2030:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Cumulative number of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs)

sold over time

<li>FCV price over time

<li>FCV investment over time (government and industry)

<li>Industry profit over time

<li>Hydrogen production required over time

<li>Hydrogen cost over time

<li>Hydrogen investment over time

<li>Hydrogen industry profits over time.

</ul>

<P>

These various functions are interdependent.  For example, the

model assumes that the number of FCVs sold each year depends on

the FCV price relative to the competition.  The FCV price depends

on the initial price, the degree of R&D investment (input

parameter) in fuel cell systems, and the cumulative number of

FCVs sold.  Initially, the FCV price is too high for significant

sales, so the model assumes government-industry cost-shared 
demonstration

projects to bring the price down.  A manufacturing "learning

curve" is assigned to each element of the FCV, so that

the price falls as more units are produced.  As more FCVs are sold,

the price falls further, simulating the actual marketplace.  We

have entered reliable data on hydrogen costs, based primarily

on the extensive hydrogen gas industry study conducted by the

Ford Motor Company as part of the DOE direct hydrogen fuel cell

vehicle project.  The amount of hydrogen is linked to the cumulative

number of FCVs on the road.
