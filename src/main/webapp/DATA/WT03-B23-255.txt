I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of exciting educational
programs we are planning. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>Certificate Program in Information Engineering </H2>
<BR>
The ISSE faculty are offering a new certificate program in Information Engineering
combining the best of our very successful MS programs in Information Systems
and in Software Systems Engineering. The goal of the certificate is to allow
students to gain knowledge and tools necessary for building advanced information
systems. This program is open to our currently enrolled students, and to
prospective students. <BR>
<BR>
The Graduate Certificate Program in Information Engineering (IE) has been
designed for persons who are involved in the specification, design, implementation
and management of data- and knowledge-intensive information systems. The
engineering of large-scale information systems requires knowledge and practical
experience in areas such as database management systems, data modeling,
knowledge acquisition, data/knowledge representation, and information and
software systems engineering. Further, large-scale information systems are
distributed over several types of networks: local-area networks, wide-area
networks and inter-networks. In order to design and build such complex systems,
information system engineering design methods and project management tools
and techniques are needed. <BR>
<BR>
In order to take the certificate courses, the applicant must have satisfied
our foundation course requirements, which may be waived if prior course
work has covered this material. 
<H3>IE Course Requirements </H3>
<BR>
To obtain the certificate, candidates must complete the following set of
courses, achieving a grade of B or better in each, for a total of 15 credits:
<UL>
  <LI>INFS 612: Data Communications and Distributed Processing 
  <LI>INFS 614: Database Management 
  <LI>SWSE 620: Software Requirements and Prototyping 
  <LI>SWSE 621: Software Design 
</UL>
<BR>
and one of the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>SWSE 625: Software Project Management, or 
  <LI>INFS 770: Methods for Information Systems Engineering. 
</UL>
<BR>
Students accepted into the IE Certificate Program are also accepted into
the MS in Information Systems program, provided they satisfy the additional
business course foundation requirement. Certificate courses count towards
the MS degree, and students may complete the degree requirements to obtain
the MS in Information Systems degree. Students already admitted to the MS
in Information Systems program or the MS in Software Systems Engineering
program are also eligible to earn the IE Certificate, by taking appropriate
electives. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>ISSE Short Courses </H3>
<BR>
We are planning a collection of short courses to be offered in Summer 1996
focusing on topics relevant to regional industry and government agencies.
Topics include: Object-Oriented Information Systems, Software Analysis and
Design, Client-Server Systems and Advanced Database Systems. <BR>

<HR>
<H3>ISSE on the World Wide Web </H3>
<BR>
The web is rapidly changing the way we do business, and we would like to
offer our readers and their companies a service that will allow us to cooperate
more closely. Many companies now fax their employment opportunities to us
for posting on our bulletin boards; we would like to take that a step further
by providing links to company and government web home pages so that our
students may explore your web sites. We have intiated a section called &quot;<A HREF="http://www.isse.gmu.edu/index.html#FRIENDS">Our
Friends in Industry</A>&quot; on the <A HREF="http://www.isse.gmu.edu/index.html">ISSE
Home Page</A>. <BR>
<BR>
If you are interested in our linking to your site from our ISSE Home Page,
please provide Sandy Mayo with your URL , or send an e-mail message to <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@isse.gmu.edu">webmaster@isse.gmu.edu</A>.
