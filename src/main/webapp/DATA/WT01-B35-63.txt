<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<hr>

<p> SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN about the Eleusinian Mysteries and
for so long a time that a word is needed to justify this
presentation of three papers dealing with them. For close to
2,000 years the Mystery was performed every year (except one) for
carefully screened initiates in our month of September. Everyone
speaking the Greek language was free to present himself, except
only those who had the unexpiated blood of a murdered man on
their hands. The initiates lived through the night in the
telesterion of Eleusis, under the leadership of the two
hierophantic families, the Eumolpids and the Kerykes, and they
would come away all wonder-struck by what they had lived through:
according to some, they were never the same as before. The
testimony about that night of awe-inspiring experience is
unanimous and Sophocles speaks for the initiates when he says: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Thrice happy are those of mortals, who having seen those
    rites depart for Hades; for to them alone is granted to have
    a true life there. For the rest, all there is evil. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Yet up to now no one has known what justifies utterances such
as this, and there are many like it. Here lies for us the mystery
of the Eleusinian Mysteries. To this mystery we three have
applied ourselves and believe we have found the solution, close
to 2,000 years after the last performance of the rite and some
4,000 years since the first. </p>

<p> The first three chapters of this book were read by the
respective authors as papers before the Second International
Conference on Hallucinogenic Mushrooms held on the Olympic
Peninsula, Washington, on Friday, 28 October 1977. </p>
