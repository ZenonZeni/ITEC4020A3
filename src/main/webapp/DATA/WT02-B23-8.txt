<H2><CENTER><I>Who will be president in 1996 and why?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PREZ -->
<LI>Harry Browne - while we still can
<LI>Harry Browne-- I don't like the other 2 'choices'
<LI>Clinton - He's not an angel - in fact, he's rather shady, but Dole offers no real alternative, and no real solutions to problems either. In my opinion, unless a bold third party alternative arises, we may as well remain with Clinton for the next four years, and then prevent Al Gore from becoming President in 2000. We can look for a new leader in four years. A real leader.
<LI>Colin Powell -- I agree with his stands on the affirmative action and abortion issues; I am impressed with his leadership capabilities.
<LI>Dole - Clinton morally unfit
<LI>bob dole because he is the best qualified for the job
<LI>Harry Browne. Keep the gov't out of the boardroom *and* the bedroom.
<LI>Harry Browne ... Because he wants to reduce just about everything in Gov't ... and believes in personal responsibility ... free market economy ... 
<LI>Harry Browne, to reduce government interference in markets and lifestyles
<LI>president Clinton because even though I dont always agree with what he is doing or his views I believe he is really trying to help this country out. Dole  is out of touch with the common man, and the common mans real life concerns.  
<LI>Bob Dole- Only because I feel that I can trust him.
<LI>Browne
<LI>Bob Dole, a mature proven leader
<LI>Gen. Colin Powell
<LI>Sadly, there are no nore heroes.
<LI>BOB DOLE; HE'S THE ONLY ONE LEFT WHO HAS A CHANCE OF BEATING BILL!
<LI>Bill Bradley, because I believe someone willing to lead without support from the Republicrats will have a better chance of restoring the people's trust in their government.
<LI>A Republican
<LI>Dole - The important thing is to get rid of Clinton.
<LI>Harry Browne or anyone who will support a free society
<LI>Bob Dole. He is the most likely man to use his abilities to influence abolishing the income tax system and replace it with a national consumption tax that is honestly fair. 
<LI>Harry Browne wants to reduce (make smaller) the government, not reduce (not enlarge to as much as it was going to) the government.
<LI>Don't know because all present choices are depressing!!
<LI>Pat Buchanan, intelligent - stands for his principles.
<LI>Harry Browne, because the larger government gets the more money and freedom are taken away from the individual
<LI>dole; clinton has no moral standing and no credibility and is way tooooo liberal
<LI>Harry Browne, but it won't happen
<LI>not clinton
<LI>Harry Browne. Only candidate that promises to significantly reduce the size of government/taxes.
<LI>Harry Browne, Big Government is at the heart of most of this country's problems.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE-THE DEMS DON'T REDUCE THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, COERCIVE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
<LI>Dole.  So the conservative congress can bring respect back to our government.
<LI>Colin Powell - I think he is not as corruptable as the other candidates
<LI>Bill Clinton.  The econony is great and we're at peace
<LI>Ross Perot - He is intelligent, caring and has his priorities straight (i.e., the national debt)
<LI>Bill Clinton has a heart and given a choice between people and business he will pick people.
<LI>Harry Browne-so he can reduce the government size.
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne, because he wants to reform government so that it functions within its originally-intended, Constitutional boundaries
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>I will vote for Bob Dole.  Battle experience, military and governmental.  I believe the Clinton's show little regard for Law.  They have a deeper involvement in Whitewater than has been uncovered thus far.  He is violating it again by his all out assault on the BRAC on closing  2 AF Logistics Centers, because they are in Texas and California, the two biggest electorates.  He is trying to redefine the 60/40 rule of core workload, he is shoving his Acquisition Reform Initiative down our throats, jeopardi
ing national security.  As a President, I find Clinton shallow.
<LI>Ralph Nader, because he is the only candidate who is at the same time honest and compassionate
<LI>I think they all are pretty much useless. Personally, I think Leslie Fish (the musician) would be good. She's very radical, but she'd certainly liven things up!
<LI>anybody but the clintons
<LI>bob dole , i,m embarrassed to have bill clinton as president
<LI>Bill Clinton: because he is intelligent, he understands the common person, he genuinely deals with the issues, he has shown the ability to compromise, he loves his job, the country needs a moderating force against the extreme right wing.
<LI>Harry Browne; offers the opportunity to make some real change and disrupt the 'status-quo.'
<LI>I feel that Bob Dole would be the only clear choice since Bill Clinton seems to be involved in one stupidity after another.  Even if he is not guilty of any wrongdoing, he is, at best, very stupid.
<LI>Browne
<LI>Harry Browne is everything I could want in a candidate.  Period.
<LI>Bob Dole, you can trust him
<LI>Clinton, because Dole will have a heart-attack if he wins
<LI>Bill Clinton....Best and ONLY choice.
<LI>Probably Bill Clinton because he's grew up poor and he's not too old, so he's more in touch with (my) reality than the others.
<LI>Bob Dole/C. Powell It is time to bring back honesty to the White House and end this embarrassment!
<LI>Ron Paul- Ideology and character
<LI>clinton
<LI>Ralph Nader, who is actually honorable
<LI>Bill Clinton,  he has done an effective job.
<LI>Buchanan:  He has the greatest resolve in the face of overwhelming odds.
<LI>I just can't see four more years of either the "demoncrats" of the "Repopublicans." But thanks the the national media most folks will mistakenly believe that these losers are their only choice.
<LI>BILL CLINTON
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>Dole-Strong integrity, military service, wise, honest.
<LI>Clinton - no better choice available at this time.  Gingrich could have done it but he turned into nothing but blubber.
<LI>Bob Dole, to get rid of Clinton and his media mafia
<LI>Harry Browne - a flat tax of zero%, return to Constitution
<LI>Buchanan, he is for keeping America FREE, Prospurous, & Soverign, unlike the rest wich are just a bunch of Communists!!
<LI>sure bob dole, just because he is a make sense people.
<LI>I believe Bob Dole has the character and intestinal fortitude to reduce our debts and allow the country to boom as never before.
<LI>Harry Browne...He's the best logical choice
<LI>Harry Browne; the only candidate with revolutionary , credible ideas.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only major candidate for less government.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He has proven to be a stable, reasonable person, with a few mistakes: NAFTA, Gays in the military idea, but he has done almost everything else right.
<LI>Harry Browne. I no longer trust either of the two major parties.
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>Gen.Powell   educated/military background/strong figure
<LI>Harry Browne so that my children might someday live in a free country.
<LI>Phil gramm
<LI>BOB DOLE
<LI>Harry Browne  It's time to try a president who's heard of the US Constitution.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The Democrats and Republicans are two factions of the Government Party, Ross Perot's Reform Party is an exercise in mush-minded centrism, and it's time to see what the Libertarians could do.  If the Republicans can't even kill off a useless department such as the Department of Education, or cut off the corporate welfare through the likes of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, then it's pretty obvious that they aren't serious about really reducing the Federal government.  Go, Har
y, Go!!! 
<LI>At this point, I would select Clinton because I don't trust Dole to address the needs of the average American.  Plus, Clinton has performed resaonably well.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he has the only credible plan which would drastically reduce the size, scope, and cost of the Federal government.
<LI>Harry Browne -- We need a smaller, less expensive, and less intrusive federal government.
<LI>Clinton, of course, because he's unquestionably the Greatest President of the Twentieth Century!
<LI>Dole
<LI>Bob Dole  This country cannot withstand another four years of the current disaster in the White House.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he is more qualifed than Bill 
<LI>James ³Bo² Gritz.  He was blocked out by the news media & our government when he ran against Clinton in the past.  Hello to Big Brother and his peeping-tom agents ...;)
<LI>Clinton because he's a great president.
<LI>Bill Clinton. Although he is too conservative for me I feel that he is honest, open and projects family values. Unlike Bob Dole he cared enough about his marriage to work it out. I would find it impossible to believe that Clinton would abandoned Chelsea the way Dole nad Newt abondned their children and wives.
<LI>Harry Browne, to restore personal rights & responsibility
<LI>Ross Perot has the ideas to get the job done on the national debt.
<LI>harry browne- I'm afan of liberty 
<LI>Dole, he can only be better than what we've seen the last 4 years.
<LI>Clinton because he is doing a good job and is better than any alternative the Republicans can produce.
<LI>Pat Buchanon;  Because I appreciate his strong Pro-Life Stance, our nation cannot have a strong moral base if we continue allow unborn babies to be murdered.  Also I appreciate the fact that Pat is not bought and paid for by the Archer Daniel Midlands and other huge corporations as Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are.  When I see a candidate being attacked by the media and Party Establisment officials then it reassures me of my judgement or tells me I need to take another look.  If the choice came down to Do
e & Clinton I would have a dilemna - I really want Clinton out, but I believe I would probably write in my pastor's name b4 I would vote for a candidate that is not convincingly Pro-Life.
<LI>At this point it's Bob Dole.  He has a Characteristic you didn't list.  He is honest and not a quibbler like Clinton and his group.  I am tired of "failed memories" and precisely worded answers designed to gove deceiving impressions!
<LI>harry browne -- eliminate the political games
<LI>Dole, because we need a balance budget that focusing on slowing the growth of entitilement programs
<LI>BOB DOLE,   ONLY ONE LEFT TO VOTE FOR
<LI>Pat Buchanan -- Because I believe he'll represent the american people and U.S.A's best interests
<LI>Harry Browne because he would get the Federal Government out of many things it has no business being involved in.
<LI>Colin Powell. We need a man with morals and character.
<LI>Clinton... At this time there is NO one else!
<LI>Dole.  While no politician is completely honest, I feel he would be much more honest then Clinton.
<LI>Pete Wilson because he represents the majority view points of Americans on most issues - abortion, immigration, affirmative action, the deficit
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>Bob Dole because he sounds like a pineapple.
<LI>Bill Clinton,because I think he would be a better person than the other candidates.
<LI>Harry Browne to reduce Fed.Gov. to Constitutional level.
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he is uncompromising on where he stands on issues.
<LI>harry browne,i beleive his views on our government or true and up to date
<LI>Harry Brown.  Only he will give us less governmet, less taxes and more freedom.
<LI>Bill Clinton--because he's right on the things I care about most deeply.  He seeks to bring us together, not divide us.  
<LI>Someone with common sense who will not lie to me 
<LI>Pat Paulsen. He's a heavy drug user, and that's cool.
<LI>Harry Browne. The LP is the only party which professes a philosophy that I believe in.
<LI>Harry Browne, who we can trust to cut govt & taxes.
<LI>Harry Browne - Would work for a much smaller Federal Government
<LI>Harry Browne due to the fact that the government that governs least governs best
<LI>Bob Dole because I don't think anyone else can beat Clinton and I would rather see anyone but Clinton as my president again.
<LI>Ross Perot: Intelligent, Honest, Dedicated - a true leader
<LI>So far Ralph Nader looks the best
<LI>I would like to someone who has the best plan for education.  Belonging to "generation X" and heading off to college, I would like to see a canidate who has a plan that could make college more affordable.  I am not happy with any of the canidates, but I would like Clinto to win.  Things are fine the way they are now.
<LI>Buchanan...He's for America first, against New world Order!
<LI>Harry Browne.  Out of all the field of candidates, he is the only one who recognizes that democracy exists for a pupose: to ensure liberty.  In my mind he is the only candidate who is faithful to the vision of the founders of the country, and the only who would enact their revolutionary plan of government, which despite 200 years of democracy has never really been carried out anywhere in the world.  I am especially attracted to his call for an end to the war on drugs and government intrusion into the c
lture and habits of the people.  I think the War on Drugs has not only in priciple been morally wrong, but has also had disastrous economic, social, and criminal side effects.  I am also especially attracted to his non-interventionist foreign policy views.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He is more in touch with what is happening today
<LI>I believe that Mr. Clinton is the candidate with his eye on the future and will be the safest choice for America
<LI>Harry Browne, he is the best man running.
<LI>Bob Dole because he represents most of the ideas I believe are good for america.
<LI>Harry Browne, Because he swears to end "the war on drugs" and legalize cannabis. 
<LI>Harry Browne, the only truthful person running.  Less Gvt now and an end to abusive & unconstitutional gvt. such as IRS FDA BATF IRS EPA NEA Fed Education. More freedom for all Americans!!!
<LI>Bob Dole because he is the most honest/experienced candidate
<LI>Snoopy could run the country better than any of the clowns currently running. And that's considering the fact that Snoopy is only a cartoon and a plush animal.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he has demonstrated clear leadership, and honest conduct, even n the face of adversity
<LI>Bob Dole, because I want to see a balanced budget amendment
<LI>Bob Dole - Because he has my respect as a leader!
<LI>Bill Clinton. He has us on the right road to economical recovery and could amaze us with good Congressional support
<LI>Harry Browne - as he is the only candidate with strong principles and positions
<LI>Dole.  Clinton has serious character flaws and very little leadership ability.  In my opinion, he is running the most ethically corrupt white house ever.
<LI>Browne is the only one of the big players who isn't a politician--that means that he's got a head on his shoulders.
<LI>Harry Browne. He will do what he says.
<LI>Harry Browne- He's the only candidate who will reduce government
<LI>Bob Dole.  Have lost all trust in the White House and those who support them.
<LI>Harry Browne, The Federal Govt. must be reduced to a tiny fraction of what it is now, and Harry and his party are the ones who would do it, not just blow hot air about it like the asses and elephants. Corruption WILL be exposed.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he would actually reduce government.
<LI>Harry Browne -- because I want LESS GOVERNMENT.  Youth Against Facism.
<LI>dole
<LI>Dole, Honest,Trustworthy, more apt to reduce government
<LI>James "Bo" Gritz !  He was blacked out by the media and the government when he first ran against Clinton.  Hello again to all my buddies working for Big BROTHER ... :)
<LI>Less Government
<LI>Ralph Nader.  He is the only honest man running, and you blacked him out just like the rest of the commercial media.  Shame on you.
<LI>Robert Dole because he seems to be a moderate and can work with Congress well.
<LI>Dole, less government, higher standards, morality
<LI>Bob Dole. He has Charactor. He does have belifes. Bill clinton just says what you want to hear. Bob Dole has not hate mongered, scared children and Sesoned citizens. Bob dole does not lie!
<LI>Bob Dole. Is for giving power back to the states.
<LI>BIll Clinton because I think that he has been fair to the people of our country.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Taxes and regulation are way too high.  War on Drugs has to end before we lose all our freedoms and prosperity.
<LI>Clinton. Dole is just too conservative
<LI>Bob Dole, can work w/ Newt to advance the Republican agenda
<LI>george bush!
<LI>Clinton, a moderate who understands the working person's problems,and will address them.
<LI>Ronald Reagan
<LI>Dole - Honest & knows the ins & outs of Washington
<LI>Harry Browne because he most represents the libertarian philosphy that "the actions of all people should be voluntarly".
<LI>Bob Dole, because he has shown himself to be an honorable person and seems to be able to forge workable solutions to complex political problems. I believe that President Clinton has failed to exercise the leadership role that is the nature of being President. He seems to believe what the latest poll tells him people want him to believe. This accounts for the dizzying rate at which his positions change. Clinton seems to be more interested in the appearance of adopting a position rather than the substanc
 of the position. For example, proclaiming his support for the Wisconsin Welfare reform Model and then failing to implement any of the elements of the reform in policy. All he wants to do is be able to tell people " I support that " when I don't believe he does. 
<LI>bob dole. He is a true man of character, with military experence, politicol experience, and is trustworthy.
<LI>Al Gore
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>A Libertarian - the only ones serious about smaller goverment
<LI>Bill Clinton deserves a second terma because he is the candidate that better represents most of American citizens and who has a foreing policy based on liberal democracy.
<LI>Buchanan - has the most moral character and real solutions of any other candidate and is consistant in his views.
<LI>Harry Browne; ideals of Libertarian party most closely match my own
<LI>Harry Browne- No Censorship/Taxes
<LI>Pat Buchanan, he's the ONLY PRO-America candidate!
<LI>dole--not clinton for the following reason --clinton cant stand by a decision for more than one day---he is the only president in history to be sued for sexually harrassment---only president who will allow his wife to belittle him in front of his staff--the only president that dodged the draft- allowed Janet Reno to send in a tank against a houseful of people--hired a surgeon general that told school kids that they needed to learn the art of masturbation --increased my taxes--- only president in histor
 to have his best friend commit suicide---the only president in history to have a vast majority of his best friends convicted on felonys or about to be investigated on felonies===I could go on about clintons lack of character but my arm is getting tired ---i'll just quote my husband --If we re-elect clinton America will get what it deserves
<LI>There are only two choices.  Be practical--Dole or Clinton.  I vote for Dole.  Now, if there were other realistic choices, maybe this question would mean more.  Be realistic.
<LI>Government Doesn't Work.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Because the democratic party has a consideral amount of lying bastards that really don't give a fuck about the country as a whole.
<LI>Bob Dole - so that the Balanced Budget Admendment to the Constitution gets passed.  This country is going broke!!!!!
<LI>George Bush; He was a great president and I believe he could have gotten the country on the right track had he been reelected
<LI>Harry Browne, we need to reverse the growth of the federal government not just slow the rate of growth.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Government is stifling creativity, personal freedom and self responsibility
<LI>Harry Browne. The Republicans have proven that they are not passionate about genuinely and boldly reducing the degree of government intrusion into our social and economic lives.  The Democrats are beyond hope, still in love with the principle of government itntervention in our lives despite the massive failure of the New Deal/Great Society legacy.  Both major parties fear serious reform of Social Security, a disaster waiting to happen.  Ross Perot's primary answer about issues is to say that "We need t
 study it, have our best people look at it" without offering any dynamic propositions of his own; if he wants to be worshipped, he should  start a church, not a political party.
<LI>harry browne he is for less gov. less taxes,more indiv.freedom,an america that was intended by the founding fathers.
<LI>Bob Dole- shift away from socalist influence of Clinton
<LI>Ambassador Alan Keyes - He is the most gifted, articulate, honest candidate for national office that I have seen and heard in my lifetime. An outstanding leader who speaks to the heart of America!
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>clinton, peoplr think:better than dole
<LI>Harry Browne because Governement is way too big
<LI>Since Ralph Nader has no chance to win, I'll vote for Clinton.  He'll protect the environment and a woman's right to choose.
<LI>Clinton- The republicans are trying to turn back all the gains made by middle and lower class people resulting from New Deal Legislation.
<LI>Brown, nothing could be better for us than an invisible fed.
<LI>Buchanan. He would stop immigration turning this country into United States of Illegal Immigrants. All but 1 of his ideas make sense. But no one is perfect. Having even 1 flaw is nigh impossible. But he is only bringing in 1 flaw. That puts him in a class with Lincoln, Washington etc.
<LI>Bob Dole because he is honest and for real.
<LI>Buchanan 1st choice. Harry Browne 2nd choice. Less government. More liberty.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The federal government needs to be reduced in both size and intrusion into peoples lives.
<LI>Harry Browne - Small Government
<LI>CLINTON -- he probably won't screw things up too badly.
<LI>James Bo Gritz.  He ran against bill, but the government/media blocked him out!

<LI>Dole
<LI>A leader with moral integrity, wisdom and vision for America
<LI>Bill Clinton because he cares
<LI>Pat Buchanan...he has character and stands for principle of restoring our Republic to a Constitutional form of government  that was originally established by the Founders
<LI>Dole will force a reduction in government via the GOP
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he's a working mans candidate as well as a man of high morals, character and leadership. He's been slandered by the political machine and the media, that proves he's on the right track!
<LI>Buchannan - Christian views
<LI>Bob Dole, because he believes people are smart enough to decide things for themselves, without government assistance.
<LI>Bill Clinton because I believe he has done a great job so far, and he came from a middle class background and understands what real people are concerned about.
<LI>harry browne - gov't does not work
<LI>Harry Browne to SERIOUSLY reduce the cost and intrusiveness of government.
<LI>Make American business build at home will help both economy and the National Debt plus it would get people off welfare, because these would be jobs that appeal to people   
<LI>Harry Browne, I agree with his objectives.
<LI>Bob Dole. Because he is not Clinton.
<LI>george bush jr.    an honest conservitive and capable
<LI>Bill Clinton, becasue he has done a good job
<LI>Harry Browne, because we need to reverse, not slow, the growth of big government which is crippling the nation.
<LI>Harry Browne; none of the other candidates match my views
<LI>Bill Clinton, basically because he has not caused our country to go into further debt.
<LI>Ralf Nader: Someone without a corupt authoratian agenda.
<LI>Perot...because he is human being who makes mistakes, has good ideas, has proven himself to be a good leader, and he is a nut!  Maybe that is what this country needs, someone to turn over the controls and say "hey, this is your country what do YOU want".  besides with the choices we have so far, i am prob. going to go with george carliton on the subject "This country was bought and sold a long time ago, the shit they shuffle around every four years means nothing, the government no longer is FOR the peo
le, I will prob. stay home on election day!"
<LI>Dole- experienced, conservative, honest
<LI>For him to be cool
<LI>Harry Browne - Why Gov't Doesn't Work!
<LI>Harry Browne: We need to follow the constitution.
<LI>of those running Bob Dole
<LI>Bob Dole and Colin Powell because they are both proven leaders.  
<LI>Harry Browne because I believe that if elected, he will actually reduce government.
<LI>Bob Dole. Bill Clinton is useless.
<LI>bob dolen because nhe wants to do away with affirmative action
<LI>anyone who is not running at this time!
<LI>0% Flat tax.  The only way to execute it properly
<LI>Bob Dole -- Strong character, and beleive that most of his positions on different issues are correct -- especially welfare, and balancing the budget.
<LI>Clinton -- best one for the job
<LI>Ralph Nader (Green), to protect our society and environment from corporate control.  WHY isn't he one of the choices above?!?!
<LI>Dole. Clinton can't be trusted to keep any promise he makes
<LI>Dole  -  best for the job with a chance to be elected
<LI>Bill Clinton--stay the course.  Bob Dole is too much of a Washington insider.  "Mr. All-American" with a closetful of skeletons.
<LI>Harry Browne - Liberty is the source of everything we value.
<LI>Dole-anyone but Clinton(no "new" democrat). poll is poor. #2-ambiguous. #12-rank 'em. #11,13,14-poor choices, mine wasn't on the lists 
<LI>any libertarian...too much government intervention in our lives
<LI>Harry Browne He understands what the Federal Government should be about
<LI>Bob Dole...We need someone who won't veto good legislation
<LI>Bob Dole-Sick of feeling Bill's pain as he tells one and all exactly what he thinks they want to hear.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Bob Dole, because Clinton is a crook
<LI>someone/anyone who cares
<LI>Harry Browne - Less government, more freedom, lower taxes
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is Libertarian
<LI>Harry Browne cause he will do what he says he will do. 
<LI>STEVE FORBES because he has not been fooled by the government.
<LI>Bob Dole - He is a man with character, leadership, and honesty.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Honesty, morals, and an anti-drug stance, because I'm tired of the lies and lack of a war on drugs.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He understands the nature of government and why it should be very limited.
<LI>Harry Browne, - a new direction of prosperity
<LI>ross perot because he is not a politian
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bill Clinton - he will protect us from the tyranny of the gingrich fascists
<LI>Harry Browne.  I want my rights back.
<LI>Browne, Libertarian, because he actually would reduce govt
<LI>Harry Browne, so we can begin the long job of regaining our rights.
<LI>Ronald Reagan-  Why not the best?
<LI>My choice for president is Bob Dole.  I think his record as a WWII hero says quite a bit about the mans character.  He has a positive vision for the future which is consistant with his beliefs.  His views do not change during an election year.   What he says is consistant with what he does.   Bob Dole was the Senate majority leader who helped send:  the first balanced buget in 40 years, welfare reform,  tax cut and many other legislative Acts to the White House.
<LI>PAT BUCHANAN.  HE APPEALS TO ME FOR HIS UNDERSTANDING OF EXACTLY WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE AND LIMIT AUTHORITY TO THOSE.
<LI>Bob Dole, only because I think Clinton is a horror!
<LI>Harry Browne.  It's the only way to reduce government.
<LI>Harry Browne  --  Will reduce federal government power.
<LI>any libertarian candidate, with a democrat or republican i only see things worsening
<LI>Somebody with morals and consideration for the poor
<LI>None of the above, but I'll vote for the least of all evils
<LI>Harry Browne need a change from Repulicrats
<LI>Harry Browne - Would actually reduce the size of government
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bob Dole--- Clinton is the biggest liar in office since Nixon!
<LI>Harry Browne he wants less government and less taxes
<LI>For the sake of America....BOB DOLE.....
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate calling for a serious reduction in the size and power of the government.
<LI>Harry Browne - It's time for government to get out of areas it shouldn't be in.
<LI>Dole Talks conservative-Governs conservative
<LI>Dole - principles; common-man, non-relativist morality; international respect and knowledge of international affairs; economics; control of federal government and burdensome regulation; reigning in system, expectations and resentments arising from preferential treatment; maintenance of adequate defense; movement toward proper use of national revenues; etc
<LI>Harry Browne; end intrusive government and the attempt to solve social problems by force; restore individual liberty and responsibility. Only then can we restore America to greatness. Realistically, I think Clinton will win, since the Republican failure to change anything will split the vote and cause many to vote Libertarian/other third party. Much can potentially be gained if the Republicans lose in this manner - as long as they know WHY they lost...
<LI>Bill Clinton has done a credible job and deserves to be returned for a second term.  His approach to issues is level-headed and judicious.  Republicans are dedicated to radical and even reckless policies.
<LI>Bob Dole because I feel he will stand by a moderate-conservative agenda when in office, while I think Clinton is taking conservative stands right now just to be reelected. 
<LI>Bill Clinton- Has been a great leader.
<LI>Harry Browne!  This country NEEDS the changes that Harry Browne proposes!  The gov't. is far to large, intrusive & out of control and has been for far too long.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has a positive vision for America, cares about average people, and shares my values.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because his ideas are closest to mine.
<LI>President Clinton.  It's the Economy, Stupid, Part II - The longest period of uninterrupted economic growth since George Washington.  Period.  There is no debate on that
<LI>Bob Dole because Clinton is a liar with no moral character
<LI>Bob Dole...a better chance for getting the right things done.
<LI>Bob Dole, for his honesty,says what he means and followss thru 
<LI>Cinton--he is doing a fine job so far, country is moving in right direction
<LI>Beckett and Calavicci in '96: Putting right what once went wrong.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only one who wants to lessen the ever increasing influence of government as portrayed in Orwell's "1984."
<LI>Pat Buchanan.  He puts the interests of the American middle class first.
<LI>Ralph Nader, only person who can be trusted to be looking out for the rights of the many.
<LI>Harry Browne is a gentlemen of principle who has respect for his fellow citizens.
<LI>Pat Buchanan: Pro-Life, Pro-Family, Pro-America
<LI>Harry Browne. Less government, no slavery for the next generation.
<LI>sweeping financial reform and less government
<LI>Harry Browne, I want much less intrusive government.  I want to have my constitutional freedoms restored and not taken away by an overbearing federal government
<LI>pat buchanan his support of job in america and not sending our manufactoring jobs out of the country
<LI>Harry Browne - The ONLY Candidate that will Reduce the size and scope of Gov. & looking for ways to expand Individual Freedom.. 
<LI>Harry Browne, will restore Constitutional govt and dismantle 80%+ of Federal govt and destroy the Federal Reserve criminal conspiracy.
<LI>Harry Browne, Others talk, he WILL reduce the government and resurrect the Constitution.
<LI>Clinton. Best feasible choice. Continue on same path.
<LI>Ralph Nader...enough said
<LI>Ross Perot because his first priority is the well-being of this nation.
<LI>I'm not certain.  However, since I _don't_ want to vote for either of the major party candidates, I'm left to vote my conscience and that leans toward libertarianism; ergo Harry Browne.
<LI>Newt Gingrich Effective leader with good ideas
<LI>Ralph Nader.  He is most likely to work toward preserving environmental integrity
<LI><h3><font color="00A0FF">The Democrats and Republicans are old news.<br>For real alternatives try <a href="http://www.math.princeton.edu/~tpbarber/3pc/">3rd Party Central</a>.</font></h3></A> </H3> </FONT>
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who is philosophically correct: metaphysically, epistemologically, ethically, esthetically, and politically.  Liberty works.
<LI>Clinton  Had enough of the dishonest republicans
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who wants to reduce the size of the federal government, not just its rate of growth.
<LI>Bill Clinton. He should continue with the job he's done the past 4 years. He should stand up against the right-wing fanatics in the House.
<LI>Clinton.
<LI>Harry Browne - very much smaller government, taxes, intrustion
<LI>Senator Fred Thompson (R-Tenn)  He has fought to make the unpopular but right changes in congress and he gives a good speech.
<LI>health care regulated for all participants
<LI>Clinton, all other choices are worse but his record on gay issues is terrible despite his stated intentions and he is about to betray us again with the marraige issue. i wish he had the nerve to either be honest about his views or act on his views. in oth
<LI>Dole becuse he is going to be the Republican Nominee.
<LI>Bob Dole, mostly because he's the best of what is left
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is committed to a free market economy, is a principled individual, would drastically reduce the size of the Federal Government and would have no foreign policy, i.e.: no entangling foreign alliances (re:  Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, etc.).
<LI>Harry Browne: He is the only candidate who will actually reduce the size of the Federal Government.
<LI>Harry Browne - complete revision of Government - straight talk - no compromises
<LI>Clinton.  The Republican right has far too much power now and the rights of the "Silent Majority" are in danger if they are allowed to perpetuate their agenda.
<LI>Harry Browne - back to the Constitution, it's well-written
<LI>Bill Clinton.  I like what most people dislike about the president.  He is flexible in his stances on issues.  Some call this "waffling" but I see it as an essential quality in a complex and enormous democracy.  There is no sense taking a hard line stance on an issue when half of the people that you've been elected to represent most likely disagree with you.  Compromise is key and Clinton seems to understand that.
<LI>Dole - Clinton is an embarassment
<LI>Harry Browne, He's cool
<LI>Browne, because he best reflects my views on government
<LI>Dole - So the congress and senate can get down to business
<LI>Harry Browne - If the national media would stop ignoring him, the public would see he is the only candidte with real answers to our country's major problems.
<LI>Harry Browne - he is the only candidate who actually wants to decrease the size of the government
<LI>Harry Browne, to downsize government.
<LI>patrick buchanan
<LI>The canidates available to choose from are  worthless rich bastards who can afford to purchase a job as a status signal.  I think that the best person for the job would be Joe Public.  My boss who make $30,000 per year as owner of the company, and would take the job of President of the United States of America for the same wage.
<LI>Alan Keyes - Position on the Founding Documents and Morals.
<LI>It would be refreshing to see a true leader emerge.  The US gov't needs to wake up before we become a third rate country!
<LI>Newt Gingrich because he is the most brilliant mind to appear in politics since Alexander the Great.
<LI>Bob Dole: of the viable candidates, he is much closer to my beliefs.  Also, Bill Clinton is a lying adulter who is an embarassment to me as an American.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he will put the country back on track towards following the Constitution
<LI>I very much want Bill Clinton for a second term.  I believe he is doing an excellent job for the country. I can't stand all the bickering on the part of the republicans. I won't vote for any of them and I'm Independent.
<LI>bob dole, because he is for a balanced budget
<LI>dole
<LI>Harry Browne because he will cut the size of government and lift the burden off of the backs of the American people.
<LI>Harry Browne:  Republicans and Democrats all *sound* like Libertarians when they're campaigning.  Once elected, however, they return to the same old expansion of government.  They ignore the Constitution (particularly the 10th Amendment, but other parts as well).  They continue to pass laws without even reading them.  (Who could possibly read and understand everything that's in those huge documents?)  They continue to exempt themselves from their own laws.  Social Security, as a "pay as you go" system,
is bankrupt.  Medicare is bankrupt.  The military is abused for political purposes to prop up foreign dictators and tyrants.  And all the while, they dig us deeper in debt, with a third of the federal budget *just paying interest* on the national debt.  The major candidates (Clinton and Dole) appear to care very little about these issues.  Government doesn't work.  This time, I'm voting my conscience.  (See http://www.math.princeton.edu/~tpbarber/3pc/ideas/waste.html for a good primer on "wasting votes."
<LI>Bill Clinton - his success speaks for itself
<LI>The Libertarian Cantidate, To reduce the influence of the US government in our lives.
<LI>Harry Browne: I want more liberty (less regulation) in my social and business activities.
<LI>Harry Browne! Govenment intrusion in our lives is the single greatest challenge we face. People must wake up and realize that asking the government to interfere in the lives of others, just invites unwanted interference into thier own lives.
<LI>Steve Forbes - We need an economically balanced government as well as a conservative republican leader who does not constantly try to punish people for being wealthy.  Most wealthy people have to work extremely hard for their money and get no health benefits or NO TAXES for clothing, toys, etc (like the military which has one of the easiest lives out there...)
<LI>Bill Clinton. Believes in what he says and tries to accomplish it.
<LI>Bill Clinton because i'm a Democrat & i support the President 
<LI>Spock and Data in '96!  The logical choice.
<LI>Lamar Alexander is the only Republican save Christie Whitman and Colin Powell who can garner the kind of bipartisan support necessary to win the presidency. 
<LI>Bob Dole, for his traditional, conservative values.  Clinton has been a pox upon the nation.
<LI>any libertarian canidate will suffice, simply because the government has forgotten who they work for
<LI>Ralph Nader. Why isn't he listed as a choice? Proven history of putting people first.
<LI>Harry Browne, increase freedom
<LI>Harry Browne, I would like to live my life with less government regulations.

<LI>BOB DOLE HE WANT'S TO MAKE THINGS BETTER NOT WORSE
<LI>Harry Browne.  I agree with every position he supports.
<LI>Harry Browne, Views on less government
<LI>Clinton  because his views are closer to mine than are those of his opponents
<LI>Harry Browne,will deliver on his promise to reduce the gov.
<LI>Browne - for a smaller government burden
<LI>bill clinton-he may appoint 2 judges to supreme court 
<LI>I can't stand this corrupt President, so I would have to vote for Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne, so that the influence of government in our lives can be reduced.
<LI>Harray Browne
<LI>If Bob Dole were a movie title, what would it be? "Dead Man Walking."
<LI>Bob Dole: He will reduce Government spending and bring a fair and responsible government to the people.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He's the most intellegent U.S. President we have had in my lifetime.
<LI>Bill Clinton, has done good job compared with previous presidents.

<LI>Bill Clinton because he is keeping us on the right track.
<LI>Bob Dole has the leadersip ability this country needs now!
<LI>Dole:
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has done a good job and cares about all members of society
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he has ideas, talks clearly and understandably about his ideas, trys to at least pass what he can, cares about enviornment, education, and the national debt, talks welfare reform not just throw it out.
<LI>Harry Browne, ... to REALLY bring about the end of BIG GOVERNMENT!
<LI>Rudy Giuliani
<LI>Dole is a working politician, Clinton and husband are liars
<LI>Bob Dole ; character and leadership experience/ability
<LI>Bill Clinton-he's done a good job so far and is the only candidate who can realistically win.
<LI>Harry Browne - He's the only one with a chance of winning who demands a smaller, less intrusive government.
<LI>browne, for a return to pure constitutionalism and ind.freedom
<LI>Colin Powell.  As someone once said, the best person for a job like President is the one who doesn't want it!
<LI>Bill Clinton, because his is the less conservative one
<LI>harry browne
<LI>Bill Clinton, He is the only qualified person. 
<LI>BUCHANON.  HE IS HONEST, PATRIOTIC, TOUGH MINDED, GOD FEARING, AGAINST THE NEW WORLD ORDER, AGAINST NAFT & GATT, PRO MILITARY, ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY AND ANTI-ABORTION.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is incorrupt, wise and dedicated to liberty and a free market, with much less government intrusion in our lives.
<LI>A Libertarian to end Socialism in this country
<LI>BILL CLINTON  HE HAS WORKED HARD  ABOVE PARTY LINE
<LI>Brown to reduce gov't and na'tl debt
<LI>Bill Clinton, I feel he is finally getting things done.
<LI>Any one who support consumption tax and nationwide medical coverage
<LI>Harry Browne - eliminate gov't intrusion!
<LI>Rick Tompkins or Harry Browne. Our problems are caused by gov't instrusion and corruption

<LI>Clinton will provide balance to the republican congress
<LI>Any Libertarian.  To stop government oppression.

<LI>Ideally, and idealogically, Alan Keys.  Only choice, Bob Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne Honest & Sensible
<LI>Ross Perot or a clone.  We need a business man to start pulling us out of our financial catastrophe.
<LI>Harry Browne because I believe his plan would save the country from bankruptcy.
<LI>Harry Browne, to reduce size of government
<LI>Harry Browne, because the government must be made to respect citizens' rights.
<LI>Rep Joe Kennedy - The best man for the job
<LI>Bob Dole-he shares more of my beliefs than Clinton or her husband
<LI>bob dole --i believe a America is going down the drain
<LI>Prefer Harry Browne, mostly bacause I don't see any real difference between the 2 major parties.  BOTH will, ahem, screw us.
<LI>Bob Dole -- honest, experienced, mature
<LI>I would like to have a Libertarian in the White House.  We have become a country of "blamers".  No one wants to take resposibility for their own actions.  Every time something goes wrong they want someone else to bail them out.  Generally this is always been thought of as the govenments' responsibility.   I want a president who advocates less government control and responsibilty.   We need to stop creating programs proliferate the governmemt "crutch".  I believe Harry Browne and the Libertarian party a
e the best answer for 1996.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne.  A Libertarian President would create a great balance in the Federal Government.  It would keep the partison, status-quo, parasitical, in-fighting losers that call themselves "politcians" in check.  Vote the individual, not the "party."
<LI>Nader because he is not beholden to big business and because  he has made his career out of helping the average working class consumer. A vote for Nader endorsed by a third party would send a message that a significant portion of the American electorate i
<LI>Sen. John McCain is a true American hero who would bring a reform yet not radical outlook to the White House.
<LI>Harry Browne  the only hope for a return of liberty and justice
<LI>CLINTON- he is the only democratic canidate that has a chance
<LI>Harry Browne has taken a stand on issues which can be viewed as more than calculated political rhetoric because he is not a professional politician concerned with re-election.
<LI>Bill Clinton so that he can put a hault on that crooked Republican Congress that is in the pocket of corporate America
<LI>Dole, he has class and experience also values to guide him
<LI>Jerry Brown - the only candidate in recent memory who seemed to be fair, and with good intentions.
<LI>Harry Browne. Freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bob Dole is the best candidate due to his policies and character.
<LI>Bob Dole, A real American Hero
<LI>Dole - At least he wants to slow down government intrusion
<LI>The candidates in 96 are not that great, I despise Dole and dislike Clinton. Unfortunatly I have to vote for the one I dislike.
<LI>Browne is the only serious candidate who is serious about reducing the size of the mammoth, painfully inept, and woefully corrupted federal government.
<LI>Harry Browne - He has a better understanding of the functions and limitations of government.
<LI>Harry Browne - he stands for less government.
<LI>Harry Brown or Steve Forbs, Reason: Both major parties want to control the public(Rep. social control/ Dem. economic control) They are the two halfs of the same coin that do not really believe in individual choice and individual freedom.
<LI>Colin Powell.  He could unite us as a nation and he is more than qualified.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Gov't must be reduced or eliminated.
<LI>Clinton, because he has done a few of the things he promised, like reducing the size of government
<LI>Harry Browne -- possible return to the Constitution -- Federal Government should be stripped of all functions except for the Big Three plus Departments of State and Defense. The central (Federal) Government should establish national policy which the states would enforce. States would collect ALL taxes and then "pay" the central government on a House district basis.
<LI>Bill Clinton- I think he's done a good job as President
<LI>Harry Browne.  He's the only candidate who would *really* work to reduce government significantly.
<LI>Harry Truman - He was honest
<LI>Bill Clinton because hes the only good choice
<LI>coiln powell because he as experinxce
<LI>Pat Buchanan - against big govt. and NAFTA/GATT
<LI>Harry Browne with Liberty and Justice for All
<LI>Pat Buchanon, because of his stance on abortion, plans to get out of the U.N., his ideas on how to stop illeagal immigration, his plans to shrink the size of government, and his plans to give more decisionsto the states. 
<LI>Clinton, age
<LI>any christian conservative /phyosophil differences are ruining young people of today
<LI>Clinton because he is concerned about people
<LI>Harry Browne, personal liberty from the gov't and my neighbors
<LI>Harry Browne, because his view of government most closely represents my philisophical principles.
<LI>Harry Browne, he believes in individual liberty
<LI>Honestly, I would like to see Dan Quayle as president in 1996. Dan Quayle is an accomplished politician with character.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  Ever since he entered the office, he has been doing his job especially trying to improve everybody's lives.  Such as the economy itself, the environment and the likes.  However, I do believe that people should see Clinton win the '96 Presidental Campaign.  
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Bill Clinton because he keeps in mind the average person and tries to make the best choices so the middle class and lower class do not have to shoulder the full responsibility of this country.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne, because we must return to a society run by those who want the poeple to be independent, instead of government-dependent
<LI>Clinton - what other choice do I have???
<LI>Dole.  Clinton can't be trusted
<LI>Bob Dole, he brings honor back into the White House.
<LI>clinton. to keep the republicans in check.
<LI>Bob Dole:  He has moral character, is a leader, served with honor for his country, gave his right arm for his country, is not a liar!
<LI>I'll vote for Clinton as the best choice available. 
<LI>Bart Simpson. He's got great hair.
<LI>BILL CLINTON , YOUNGER AND BETTER QUALIFIED THAN DOLE
<LI>Bob Dole.  Clinton is spending too much money on bad ideas.
<LI>Bob Dole...if Clinton gets re-elected, I'm moving to Canada!  Seriously, I don't understand how American's can ignore the fact that Bill Clinton is a LIAR!!!  He is unethical, he has no morals or character.  It makes me sick knowing my grandfather fought in three wars, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and there's a draft dodger in the White House.  I love America, but right now, I'm ashamed of our leader.
<LI>Browne - Freedom
<LI>Bob Dole, since he has the Rep. nom.  Can't trust "Bill"
<LI>Harry Browne - I just can't trust Democrats and Republicans anymore, its time for a real change.
<LI>Bob Dole because he represents my conservative values, is honest and has integrity
<LI>Pat Buchanan..He is the only one that wants to reduce the government down to constitutional levels.
<LI>Bob Dole because Bill Clinton is an idiot and has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he is unqualified to run our country.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is honest, fair, and Libertarian.
<LI>Bill Clinton, clearly more caring and fear of a republic goverment and incluence of the right wing!
<LI>Bill Clinton, best choice among many undersirables
<LI>Harry Browne - because he's not one of the "good old boys".
<LI>Clinton; he takes a licking and goes on ticking!
<LI>His "friends" are guilty, his successor in Arkansas is guilty, and he had not done anything illegally regarding Whitewater?!?  Yeah Right, and I've got a bridge to sell you.
<LI>Bill Clinton - He shows concern for issues that will HELP our society, not divide it.
<LI>Harry Browne.  If he carries out his ideas we can turn our country around again!
<LI>Harry Browne is the only alternative to the big mess in DC
<LI>Harry Browne. Read his book. That's what I want to see for our county.
<LI>Harry Browne - greatly reduced government
<LI>Bob Dole because he is a man of integrity and honesty.  He is a man that I don't always agree with but he is a man who cares that America is the best it can be.  His backgrounds shows this to be true.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The democrans and republicrats have a lot more in common than they pretend to.  It's time to make these polyticrites get real jobs and return political power to people who actually remember what it is like to work for a living.  Also it is about time that "We the People" quit squishing "I the Individual."
<LI>H. Browne because I think he can balance the budget successfully.
<LI>Harry Browne - much smaller gov't, more personal freedom
<LI>Harry Browne -- before the Federal Budget totally collapses
<LI>Myself, I stand for everything I believe in.
<LI>I hope and I see from the other political polls that Harry Browne is the best choice that we have as a nation. PS in reference to question 15 we have a flat tax now. Contact me if you care to discuss this. wwatts@nothinbut.net
<LI>Dole
<LI>clinton..because experienced; better choice; admits his past mistakes, & who cares if he didnt go to vietnam...he's human & i like it because of his family ties with wife; daughter and mother..shows he is human not a washington robot...only God is prfect!!! he's the best choice...the only other person i would vote for is God...my Republican husband is voting for President Clint too!!! & he spent 6 tours in viet nam!!!
<LI>Harry Browne - He will cut gov't
<LI>Bob Dole-Not a phony southern governor
<LI>Bill Clinton-- He is the best of the candidates out there
<LI>Dole. Clinton is a boat anchor with reguards to change.
<LI>Harry Browne; he will begin the process of ending governmental control.
<LI>Clinton, the lesser of two evils
<LI>Robert Dole
<LI>Harry Browne - radical changes in the size of the government
<LI>Given the choice I would prefer Bob Dole. I feel Clinton is too amoral to be national leader. Dole is a proven professional.
<LI>Steve Forbes, the flat tax.
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne,  The Libertarian party has some excellent idea.  The Republicans and Democrats have not been able to accomplish anything in the White House.  I'm will to let another party, with fresh ideas give it a try.
<LI>Bob Dole.   He is clearly the only person of Presidential stature currently running for the office.
<LI>I would like to see Clinton relected.  He the best choice at this point.
<LI>Whitewater.... Clintons.... GUILTY!
<LI>Reverse the trend to big government
<LI>Bob Dole - less gov't intrusion
<LI>Bill Clinton - If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  America ain't broke, some work in progress, but were on the correct path.
<LI>Harry Browne,  I see little dirrerance between  demo and repubs
<LI>browne- he does not subscribe to the myth that government can work
<LI>Bob Dole...he is a good man for the office and also has alot of experience
<LI>Steve Forbes because most of his goals are reasonable and I agree with him on most issues
<LI>Dole - words mean things and Bill Clinton has lied enough
<LI>Harry Browne - the only consistent advocate for govt reduction
<LI>Pat Buchanan   He  believes in what he stands for.
<LI>Bill Clinton or Al Gore or possibly Colin Powell
<LI>Harry Browne; because he is for limiting goverment's involvement in our lives
<LI>Clinton, cuz I don't want any of the ultra conservative types to gain power...
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate who will get government out of our wallets, out of our bedrooms, and out of our lives.
<LI>Bob Dole 
<LI>Bob Dole:  He has Character
<LI>Bill Clinton. Most qualified and has proved it over the last 3 1/2 years.
<LI>Clinton - Has a better grasp of Am. situation than Newt!
<LI>Dole because he has moral integrity and standards. It has been an embarrassing 4 yrs. We have lost face w/other nations.  He also will appoint less liberal judges, that will only help the justicial branch. 
<LI>Bob Dole, he will be the republican nominee, thats who I will vote for.
<LI>Dole; The best candidate with a chance to win.
<LI>Bob Dole because he will sign the bills that "Bill" vetoes!
<LI>Clinton, coz Dole-Gingrich are right-wing nuts and they scare me
<LI>Alan Keyes - America has only so much time left!
<LI>Marci Kaptur-Ross Perot or ANY REFORM PARTY candidate Bob Kerry, James Traficant, Tim Penney, Dick Lamm, David Boren, Hank Brown, Linda Smith to give another option and beat Clinton
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Clinton, because he will protect social programs, education and the environment.
<LI>Bill Clinton - He's the lesser of two evils.  Bob Dole is too old and too republican.  I think that Dole would throw the United States into a modern dark ages or a modern McCarthy era.
<LI>A president who really thinks of America first.
<LI>Harry Browne: I consider myself to be socially liberal and economically conservative.  I believe that Congress would serve to curb the more "radical" Libertarian ideas that scare most people off.
<LI>dole - past history is good, really wants to be president for the right reasons - not inflated ego - just a good person who has the political background to make a good president. 
<LI>It's boiled down to the lesser of two evils. Although I am against Republican conservatism, I make enough money to force me to vote for the group that will provide me the best tax incentives. Democrats will not do that.
<LI>Dole He is better qualify
<LI>Harry Browne - Because he will reduce Government!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He stands for freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne, he will produce noticable, positive results by reducing federal governement drastically.  He will reduce government to the size and scope originally intended by the authors of the US Constitution.  
<LI>BOB DOLE -CHARACTER
<LI>Harry Browne, Real tax reform, eliminate the IRS! Other reasons.
<LI>Browne, because he is a libertarian
<LI>Harry Browne, because everybody else is a clueless laut.
<LI>I want to see someone who DOESN'T feel like America is headed down the Evil Path and he is the only one who can stop it.
<LI>Moderate Congress Elected, Clinton re-elected
<LI>Bill Clinton -- He is a Good President
<LI>Harry Browne- I want to see the Government drastically changed, given back to the people.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he will get government off our backs
<LI>COLIN POWELL
<LI>Harry Browne--the ONLY candidate who clearly sees what the real problem is.
<LI>Jerry Brown. A moral, libertarian man who practices what he preaches, and perhaps is the only noncorrupt politician out there. Tune into his radio show, "We the People" on Pacifica Radio!
<LI>Harry Browne - less government
<LI>Democrats + Republicans = Exactly the Same, No Change ... We Need CHANGE
<LI>Bob Dole, at least he believes in something
<LI>Dole,  he is a grownup.
<LI>Pat Buchanon - I admire his attitude
<LI>Ross Perot = he seems more honest and really makes people think about politics
<LI>Alan Keyes...I like what he stands for on issues.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He will slash the size of government.
<LI>Bill Clinton--gay friendly
<LI>Bob Dole / Colon Powell (Pres/VP) They will (along with a republican congress) address the rising social security costs and make real progress in balancing the budget and reducing the national debt.
<LI>Bob Dole. He will bring credibility back to the White House.
<LI>I do not like the choices, however, Bob Dole is my choice. I would like to see our leader be a man of integrity. Honesty is paramount to govern a nation in strength. I believe out of choices available to us, that Bob Dole has this capacity. Everyone else fails miserably.
<LI>BOB DOLE, DEMOCRATS JUST HAVE IT ALL WRONG
<LI>Harry Browne:  His grasp of Libertarian Ideals.
<LI>Harry Browne, because the era of big government is over.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is most likely to advance a national health plicy that will bring all Americans under coverage that will provide the needed coverage for all.
<LI>bill clinton because he cares and has an outstanding record
<LI>Clinton, best of the bunch.
<LI>Harry Browne: Feasible, concrete plan set forth in "Why Government Doesn't Work?"
<LI>I'm not really happy with any of the choices but whoever is and Congress need to cooperate and get something done instead of just lip service 
<LI>rush
<LI>Bill Clinton...He has done a good job and deserve re-election.  Bob Dole has been unable to articulate why he should be President, rather than Bill Clinton.
<LI>Dole- Can't take 4 more years of Clinton
<LI>No Republicans or Democarts. Both pander to big business and those minorities with financial and/or political power. It's time for coalition of small unadultrated parties who learn to compromise with each other to get the country going. Right now no one k
<LI>Pat Buchanan, he is for real Americans, not illegals.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has moved our country forward as he promised in the 1992 election.
<LI>I would be most likely to support a moderate or liberal candidate who is experienced and does not pander.  Both Dole and Clinton are guilty of acting for political gain rather than on principle or common sense.  I would vote for Clinton, but more because I disapprove of the Republican agenda than because I approve of his.
<LI>Clintom- balanced control of  deficit and human issues
<LI>Clinton -- represents my views on most issues
<LI>Harry Browne.  It's time to kill the omnipotent state.
<LI>ANY LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE.  LESS GOVERNMENT, MORE CONTROL AT A LOCAL LEVEL.  A MARKET ECONOMY.
<LI>Almost anyone other than Clinton.  Dole seems to be the only
<LI>Harry Browne...Only candidate that will recognize and enforce Individual choice and Freedoms.
<LI>Harry Browne because he's the only one willing to ditch the IRS and balance the budget by CUTTING GOV'T. EXPENSES
<LI>Bill Clinton. The Other choise is same old, same old.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he supports many of my beliefs.
<LI>Pat Buchanan, because he stands on principle and believes what he says
<LI>HARRY BROWNE - LIBERTARIANS OFFER NEW ALTERNATIVES
<LI>Anyone but Bill Clintonl
<LI>Pat Buchanon because he's not scared of dealing with the issues that need to be dealt with, he pulls no punches and I believe his ideas to be valid, workable ideas. He stands for morality and America first.
<LI>Jesus Christ, because He is the Way the Truth and the Life
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate who believes citizens of the U.S. should have more liberty than they currently have, not less.
<LI>bob dole, i believe he supports less gov.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he is the GOP candidate
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who stands firmly for less government.
<LI>Anyone (even None of the Above) other than Bill Clinton. Why? Be serious!
<LI>Bill  Clinton  because  he  supports  education  and  to  be  honest  is  really  the  best  of  an  overall  bad  bunch.
<LI>Someone from middle class (there are the ones that pay for everthing)
<LI>Gen. Colin Powell/ I appreciate the authority he represents in dealing with the Middle East and other places.  He has been there, and knows whether WE should be there , or not.  I feel that we need to have somebody in office that can make a decision, and stick to it!  I think Gen. Colin Powell would do that!  I also agree with his views on many other things.
<LI>Harry Browne because he will seriously try to reduce government and taxes
<LI>Harry Browne, had enough big government.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the *only* one who proposes *less government*, not more. 
<LI>Dole. Would offer a charnce to get contract with America passed.
<LI>bob dole - character, credibility, a fighter
<LI>Bill Clinton, best available candidate, we need a balance to the strong right-wing tendencies of the Congress (especially the House of Representatives)
<LI>Harry Browne for a better life
<LI>Bob Dole less government & lower taxes
<LI>dole
<LI>O.J. Simpson
<LI>Ambassador Alan Keyes  has more experience and know-how than all the rest put together.  
<LI>Bill Clinton-stands up to congress and does'nt take their crap
<LI>BOB DOLE, GET THE JERK OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE!!!
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Harry Browne - The only candidate who has the consistent, moral philosophy of government that initiates no force against its citizens and exists only to protect people from force or fraud initiated by others.
<LI>Harry Browne-to reduce the size and cost of Federal gov't.
<LI>Harry Browne - we need REAL change
<LI>Buchanan He is the only candidate who knows what he believes
<LI>Bill Clinton should be re-elected. He is a proven leader with great ideas. He has hope for the future of the country and believes that a government empowered by the people can do good.
<LI>Harry Browne:  Restore Individual Rights
<LI>I trust Clinton. He came into office facing a mess, I am willing to give him more time to implement HIS plans for fixing the problems that the republicans left us with.
<LI>Bill Clinton He's the only person I believe who can beat Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne to save us from collapse
<LI>anybody but clinton,he is the consumat mesomorph dirven solely by the poles and photo opps.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he's on the right track
<LI>Harry Browne:  Government needs to be drastically reduced from the all-powerful, uncaring machinery it has become.
<LI>Pat Buchanan, for he stands strong on what he believes and he has a vision for America.
<LI>Rep. Henry Bonilla-R-Texas
<LI>Harry Browne.  Read his book!
<LI>Harry Browne because he is a Libertarian.
<LI>Alan Keyes for his knowledge of America's true problem: poor moral standards
<LI>President Clinton has done a credible job and deserves to be re-elcted.  Bob Dole and the Republicans are irresponsible, appealing to all that is worst in the American electorate; hatred, fear, bigotry.  Clinton is far from perfect, but thank God he's around!
<LI>Definition of a campaign platform and actually sticking to the principals behind it.  Removing moral issues, such as pro-life, from the political arena and putting them to a vote.  Treat government as a business with finite reaources and then priortize i.e. finscal responsability.  I realize the president can not achieve many things by himself, however, he should stand behind these principals.
<LI>bill clinton, "Dole is '96"
<LI>bob dole
<LI>ralph nader, gov. by people not corporations
<LI>Browne, because Dems & Repubs are too similar and don't represent me.
<LI>Bob Dole: He has the necessary experience in government and knows the system.  Clinton is a fish out of water.  He talks a good game, but doesn't know the rules and only listens to the last person he talks to, usually a person steeped in liberal hogwash.
<LI>clinton
