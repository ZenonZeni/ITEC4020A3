<p align=center><font color="#000080"><b>PLAN (Planned Lifetime Assistance Network)</b></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is PLAN? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - a NAMI network funded by a grant from the Center for Mental Health 
Services Community Support Program/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human 
Services </p>
<p>2 - a network of organizations which function in lieu of families in the long-term 
care of mentally ill persons </p>
<p>3 - a network of organizations which assist families in planning their estates to 
ensure that their child or relative will always live in a comfortable environment, 
have adequate funds, maintain a good quality of life, &amp; have competent, caring 
people to look after him/her </p>
<p>4 - not in lieu of case management, housing, residential, or entitlement services </p>
<p>5 - an organization which advocates for the mentally ill and which monitors the 
services they receive from elsewhere in the mental health system </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How PLAN operates </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - creates a written plan for the future which sets out those activities &amp; services 
which a family wants to guarantee for their loved one </p>
<p>2 - creates a financial mechanism (ie.Special Needs Trust) to pay for activities 
&amp; services the family wants guaranteed after it is no longer able to provide </p>
<p>3 - identifies a service provider &amp;/or trustee to see to it that planned activities &amp; 
services are implemented </p>
<p>4 - ensures that the best possible care from the mental health system &amp; from 
government entitlement benefits is provided to the mentally ill family member, 
either in the community or in a hospital </p>
<p>5 - acts as an advisor to trustees chosen by parents prior to death </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Benefits of using PLAN </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - helps clients be more compliant with their medication regimens </p>
<p>2 - ensures that clients are tapping the mental health system for all it has to offer </p>
<p>3 - helps to ease parental concerns about the future well-being of disabled 
children </p>
<p>4 - helps parents to understand what good planning for future care involves </p>
<p>5 - assumes some responsibility for disabled adult children, thus allowing 
parents to improve the quality of their own personal, family, &amp; social lives </p>
<p>6 - PLAN may take a more objective approach to the child's problems &amp; thus 
provide more consistent responses to them </p>
<p>7 - PLAN assumes responsibility for overseeing tension-producing activities 
like the monitoring of financial resources </p>
<p>8 - provides assurance that siblings will not be unduly burdened in the future </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Special Needs Trusts </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - a means of providing funds to pay out-of-pocket expenses or to hire a social 
worker who will fulfill some of the parental advocacy roles </p>
<p>2 - third-party arrangements </p>
<p>3 - allow parents to channel money for specific uses that do not conflict with 
government entitlement programs </p>
<p>4 - must be drafted by an estate lawyer </p>
<p>5 - ensures money is not directly available to the disabled adult, but is 
administered through a trustee &amp; restricted to uses that supplement government 
services </p>
<p>6 - analyze the child's needs before determining how much to fund the trust </p>
<p>7 - inter vivos trusts </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. established while parents are still alive </p>
<p>b. costs between $1000 &amp; $2000 to set up </p>
<p>c. funds are available immediately after parents die </p>
</blockquote>
<p>8 - testamentary trusts </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. created in a will </p>
<p>b. $500 to set up </p>
<p>c. funds are available only after parents' estate has gone through 
probate </p>
</blockquote>
<p>9 - possible trustees </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. relatives </p>
<p>b. banks </p>
<p>c. charitable organizations </p>
<p>d. parents' groups </p>
</blockquote>
<p>10 - pooled trusts </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. involve contributions from many sources </p>
<p>b. some programs oversee the financial side of the trust while others 
use income from the trust to employ a social worker to monitor care 
services </p>
<p>c. usually operate on a local level </p>
<p>d. contact local disability organizations for information about them </p>
<p>e. require an enrollment fee, yearly expense charges, &amp; a minimum 
contribution (approximately $30,000) upon the parents' death </p>
<p>f. accessible to low-income families because they can be funded 
with proceeds from life insurance policies &amp; pension plans </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How to start a PLAN </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - there is no one right way to start a PLAN </p>
<p>2 - tailor decisions to the needs of the families your PLAN will serve </p>
<p>3 - recruit a board of 6 to 12 persons with a broad range of skills &amp; experiences 
(ie. families, consumers, experts in law, experts in finance, business, marketing) </p>
<p>4 - conduct a survey of local family advocacy groups to determine if they are 
willing to support a PLAN </p>
<p>5 - get support from statewide family advocacy groups </p>
<p>6 - decide whether to establish a new, separate organization or to join one </p>
<p>7 - incorporate your PLAN as a private non-profit organization </p>
<p>8 - look to existing PLANs for models &amp; establish by-laws </p>
<p>9 - determine the geographic area your PLAN will serve &amp; file a 501(c)(3) 
application with the Internal Revenue Service </p>
<p>10 - develop a business plan to include budget, funding sources, &amp; revenue goals </p>
<p>11 - explore &amp; determine sources of revenue to solicit (ie. government contracts, 
client fees, grants, corporate giving programs) </p>
<p>12 - determine the type of services you will provide based on survey information </p>
<p>13 - recruit professional (not volunteer) staff to manage the program 
development </p>
