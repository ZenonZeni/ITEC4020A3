FROM THE EDITOR


Rich Heintz, a new member of our staff, compiled a lot of
information about the various segments of the SMT equipment
market for this issue.  We appreciate the help that all of  you,
who have been contacted, have given Rich.  Gathering
information can be a hard job because people in the industry
don't see the payback to themselves for taking the time to talk. 
Rich is a good interviewer, and thorough, which means that
talking to him often helps a person clarify his or her own
thinking about the nature of the market and the dynamics
within the market.  Like any good dialogue, a conversation
with Rich can increase your enthusiasm and your knowledge
of the market.  We do not just take information when we talk
to people; We try to give it back  as good as we got it.  

In talking to manufacturers in the electronics industry, we get
the feeling they do not expect 1996 to be quite the year 1995
was.  In particular, people don't seem to think the U.S.
personal computer industry can sustain the growth of last year. 
We're not saying things look gloomy, only lest robust.  We
believe, though, that there are some hopeful signs in this
market, especially for people working with the expertise and
equipment devoted to SMT.  While the market for portable
computers has remained more sluggish than experts predicted
a couple years ago, we still feel that the potential for this
market is great.  The big factor, we feel, is price.  We kept
hearing that prices on portables were going to come down at
the end of last year.  Acer's entrance into the U.S. market was
supposed to help this.  It did not happen.  If it happens this
year, portables could cause the entire PC market to perform
better than expected.  In addition, the European market for
PCs will probably be better this year than last.  Companies
able to take advantage of this market will benefit.

The other area that we've been keeping our eyes on, which we
think has good potential for SMT people in 1996, is the
wireless communications industry.  Some people are saying
this market will not do as well in 1996 as it did in 1995, but
we're of the opposite opinion.  Much work with high-
frequency components, along with the development of two
standards--code division multiple access (CDMA) and
personal communication services (PCS)--, promise, we feel, to
help the 1996 U.S. market for wireless devices outperform the
1995 market.  The Yankee Group (Boston, MA) projects
cellular growth will be up from $70 million in 1995 to around
$100 million in 1996.  The cellular partnership formed by
Nynex, Bell Atlantic, U.S. West and AirTouch
Communications placed a $600 million order for new phones
from Motorola Inc., Nokia Oy of Finland and Audiovox Corp. 
This represents three million analog cellular phones over a
one-year period.  PCS carriers will generate approximately
$10 billion in annual revenues by the year 2000, and $18
billion by 2005 according to Economic and Management
Consultants International (New York, NY).  These new
networks will translate into multi-billion dollar expenditures to
infrastructure providers such as AT&T, Motorola, Northern
Telecom, Ericsson and the many contract manufacturers who
work with these larger companies to produce subassemblies. 
While the U.S. market will be good for wireless
communications, developing countries, such as China will be
very good targets for wireless sales because of the lack of
traditional communications infrastructure.  Now, with the
development of wireless equipment, some experts are
predicting that this traditional type of communications
infrastructure will never be installed in developing countries.


Wireless, or non-tethered, communications devices range from
cordless telephones to mobile cellular phones to fashion-
coordinated pagers.  The big news in cordless phones is the
migration of digital systems operating in the 900-MHz range
using spread-spectrum technology.  Manufacturers expect to
ship more than a million such units by midyear.  In the United
States, cellular telephone systems are beginning to migrate to
digital technology, but there appears to be a few more years of
life remaining in analog mobile phone service.  Cellular
Digital Packet Data is just now being introduced as a way to
piggyback digital data onto existing voice-band systems. 
Growth for analog cellular will remain strong throughout the
year.

Somewhere between full-blown cellular systems and in-house
cordless phones, is Personal Communications Services (PCS),
which caused a big stir last year when the Federal
Communications Commission held auctions to sell spectrum
space in major cities.  During 1996, PCS systems will finish
their initial build-outs and begin offering services that compete
with both cellular and wire-line telephony.  In Europe, the
digital cellular system called GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) is already a hit.  Well over one million GSM
handsets have already been sold.

In South America, Africa, Asia, and many island countries,
cellular and PCS phones are the only solution because an
infrastructure of wired communications services does not
exist.  Almost half of all new sales of two-way wireless
equipment will be in these areas.  These wireless systems can
be set up quickly and work well.

BULL NAMES BENDER V.P.


Bull Electronics (Boston, MA) named Louis P. Bender its new
V.P. of Marketing & Business Development.  Bender's most
recent position was a V.P. of Worldwide Sales for Avex.  In
his new position, Bender will have full responsibility for all
Bull's external sales and marketing efforts, especially on the
company's aggressive efforts to grow its high-end circuit board
business for regional, national, and multi-national customers. 
Bull's president, Brian Byrne, said:  "Louis has outstanding
skills and experience, both as an executive in the contract
manufacturing business and in a variety of senior marketing,
sales, and business development positions.  We are very
pleased to have him on our team and expect him to make a
rapid impact on our growth objectives."

Next month we'll talk to Bender about what enticed him away
from a top position at Avex in America's southern
manufacturing belt.

SALES UP AT MERIX


Merix Corp. (Forest Grove, OR), who finalized the acquisition
of Hewlett-Packard's PCB facility in Loveland, CO, reported
2Q96 sales grew 35% to $33.6 million from $24.8 million in
2Q95.  Net income for the quarter ended 11/25/96 rose to $2.9
million, or 45 per share, from $2.6 million, 42 per share, in
the same quarter a year ago.  Merix also reported six-month
sales rose 29% to $61.3 million versus $47.6 million during
the same period a year ago.  Net for the six months was $5.6
million, or 86, versus $4.6 million, or 75.

SOLECTRON 1Q SALES UP 36%, NET 50%


Solectron Corp., who completed its acquisition of Hewlett-
Packard's PCB assembly operation in Boeblingen, Germany, 
reported 1Q96 sales grew 36% to $691 million from $506.7
million in 1Q95.  Net income for the quarter ended Nov. 25,
1995, which was up 50% to $27.3 million, or 52 cents per
fully diluted share, from $18.2 million, or 38 cents per fully
diluted share.  Annualized return on equity was said to be
19.7%.  Operating income was $40.8 million versus $28.7
million in the year-ago quarter.  We talked to one of
Solectron's competitors a few days ago and, when we
mentioned the company, he said:  "They are one of the stars of
the industry."  A few years ago, we had the chance to sit and
talk with Koichi Nishimura, the president of Solectron.  At one
point, we asked him to what he attributed Solectron's success. 
Without hesitation, he replied:  "Our people."  We like a
person who answers are quick and short.  We explored this
area with Mr. Nishimura and found that Solectron invested a
lot in their employees, offering training and opportunities for
them to participate in the decision making that goes on in the
company.

SM SENSOR KEEPS TRACK OF FISH


Star Oddi (Rykjavik, Iceland) wanted to monitor cod and
Atlantic salmon in the Islandic waters.  A device was designed
to periodically measure and record pressure and temperature. 
The data is used to compare growth of fish in different
environments.  The device, the DST 100, had to be small
enough to be placed internally and externally without causing
problems to the fish.  In order to produce the DST 100, a
surface mountable pressure sensor, the Model 1431, was
created by EG&G IC Sensors (Milpitas, CA).  The Model
1431 pressure sensor consists of a micromachined silicon
pressure sensor chip mounted on a ceramic substrate.  A
ceramic lid is bonded to the ceramic base to provide
mechanical protection for the sensor element.  The pressure
sensor chip is formed by chemically etching hundreds or
thousands of thin diaphragms into a 4 in. silicon wafer.  Later
in the manufacturing process, a glass wafer is electrostatically
bonded to the silicon wafer under vacuum, sealing a vacuum
reference within the sensor.  Once this has been accomplished,
the wafer is sawed apart to create individual sensors.

Boron impurities are implanted in selected regions of the
silicon diaphragms to form piezoresistors--resistors that
change their electrical resistance in response to changes in
strain.  Multiple resistors are interconnected into a Wheatstone
bridge circuit so that a change in diaphragm strain results in a
proportional change in sensor output voltage.  After
fabrication is completed, individual chips are tested to verify
that they are functioning properly.  The chip is then attached to
a ceramic substrate, wire bonds are made to form electrical
connections from the chip to the package, and a ceramic lid is
epoxied to the ceramic substrate to provide mechanical
protection for the sensor chip and the wire bonds.  Pressure
enters the sensor through an opening located at the base of the
top cover.  After a conventional IR reflow process, solder on
the bottom of the ceramic substrate forms the electrical
connection to the board, or hybrid circuit.

MICRON CMS EXPANDS SMT CAPABILITY


Micron Custom Manufacturing Services Inc. (Micron CMS)
began as an onsite division of Micron Technology in 1984,
providing board-level product design, assembly, and testing. 
Micron CMS began offering contract manufacturing to
vexternal customers in 1989, and established its current
autonomous location in 1990.  The operation became a
subsidiary in March, 1992, and became ISO-9001 certified in
February 1993.  In 1995, Micron CMS, Micron Computer, Inc.
and ZEOS International Ltd. entered into a merger to form
Micron Electronics, Inc.  Micron CMS is currently expanding
its contract manufacturing services by adding several SMT
lines.  The expansion is taking place in its Boise, ID and
Durham, NC plants.

The Boise facility consists of 92,000 square feet in two
adjacent buildings.  Over 550 employees operate seven fully
automatic surface mount manufacturing lines, which operate
24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet customer demand. 
The Boise facility is scheduled to have an eighth line up and
running by February 9 of this year. 

The Durham facility, established in January 1995, began with
an initial investment of approximately $10 million.  It has 75
employees and its third SMT line began operation on January
17 of this year.  A fourth line is scheduled for delivery in mid-
march, 1996, to be in production by April 1996.  The new
lines in Durham  increase the floor space there from 30,000
square feet to 60,000 square feet.  The Durham facility expects
ISO 9002 certification in April 1995.

MCMS said:  "Beyond the quality and competitive pricing all
customers expect, we believe the significant factors in contract
assembly are technology, service and cycle time.  Location is
also becoming increasingly important."

JAPANESE ELECTRONICS TO LOOK UP


After five years of declines, consumer electronics output will
increase in Japan in 1996 due to the creation of new products
such as car navigation systems and other digital devices,
according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan,
which represents 600 companies.  Total production of
electronics in 1996 will be $234 billion, up 5.7% over this
year.  Leading the way will be higher production of
semiconductors and components to fuel booming worldwide
demand for chips from makers of computers and mobile
phones.

With the reawakening of the Japanese electronics industry,
there will come renewed capital spending for production
equipment.  Tencor Instruments' sales of in-line inspection
equipment to Japan constituted 16% of the company's total
revenue in 1993, the year Japan began recovering from its
economic slump.  In 1995,  the Japanese market made up 26%
of Tencor's company revenues.  This number is expected to
increase to 28% in 1996.

VOLUME KEY TO SUCCESS


We received a news release from Pittiglio Rabin Todd &
McGrath (PRTM) about a study they've completed:  1995
High-Performance Factory Benchmarking.  We called PRTM
and spoke to them about the study because it seemed like the
sort of information that our subscribers would be interested in. 
PRTM does multi-client studies for large companies.  This one
was sponsored by AT&T, Compaq, Digital Equipment, GE
Medical Systems, IBM, Nokia Mobile Phones, Nortel, Pitney
Bowes, Sequent and Unisys.  They don't offer the studies for
sale to other companies, but, in part to advertise PRTM, but
also in part as a service to the manufacturing industry, they
release some of the information for the general population.

PRTM's examination of manufacturing processes revealed the
significant impact high volume had on factory costs in 1995. 
For example, median cost per placement for printed circuit
board assembly was 32 for factories with a volume of 25
million placements, 15 for those with 200 million, and only
10 for those with 800 million.  The study indicated that the
high-tech industry has recognized the importance of volume: 
volumes have risen throughout the industry and reduced
overall product assembly costs.  For example, median cost per
placement for printed circuit board assembly declined by 20%
since 1992, from 35  to 28 .  PRTM attributes this to the
decreasing number of low-volume producing, various factory
improvements, and the increasing reliance on outsourced
production.

Though median assembly costs have dropped, typical
companies are still lagging behind the best-in-class
competitors--the top 20%--whose costs are at 7  per
placement.  Figures show, however, that the best-in-class
companies saw no cost improvements during the last few
years.  "Our numbers indicate that the influence of volume
may have topped out for the leading companies," said Raj
Nooyi, a director at PRTM.  "However, though volume is still
key, some of the other cost-related areas companies can
address include plant location [offshore facilities], unique part
numbers manufactured [component mix], PCB assembly
density, and the ratio of indirect [managers] to direct
employees [operators]."

Volume is also a major factor in low material acquisition
costs.  PRTM found that the material acquisition rate--the cost
of acquiring the material as a percentage of material
expenditures--varies from 1% to more than 20%.  Companies
with a volume of $25 million worth of material expenditures
had a rate of 6%, while companies at $200 million were just
over 3%, and those at $800 million were at 2.3%.

"Again, companies buying the most material are obviously
going to have the lowest rates," said Nooyi, "but companies
can still find ways to remain competitive within their volume
categories.  They can improve the efficiency of their
acquisition function by examining the number of suppliers, the
number of parts procured, percentage of material procured
from international sources, and the percentage of material
received without inspection."

In the high-tech arena, where getting to market quickly means
the difference between market leadership and a warehouse of
obsolete inventory, the time required to ramp up a product
from first prototype to full-volume production is critical.

"With the product life cycle under 35 weeks in segments like
personal computers and consumer electronics, the pressure on
companies is tremendous," says Nooyi.  "The median launch
and ramp-up time in the PC industry is only 10 weeks--and
each day the factory operates at less than peak capacity,
hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue can be lost."

A major factor in a product's manufacturing launch time is the
number of engineering change orders (ECOs), which are
typically brought about by product design quality issues and
difficulties with component sourcing.  Best-in-class companies
speed their development cycle times--and save significant
money--by reducing the number of mistakes made in the
design process.  In fact, best-in-class computer companies
generate 84% less ECOs within the first year of production
than average companies.

Proper management of inventory is also critical for cost,
flexibility and cycle-time performance.  For example, across
all industries, sourcing time (the time to specify and acquire
materials and components) comprises nearly 75% of the entire
source-make cycle-time--but companies that find ways to
reduce sourcing time take a dramatic lead time advantage.  In
addition, companies that improve inventory management gain
cost, flexibility and cycle-time advantages.  The personal
computing industry has proven itself a leader in this area, with
fewer inventory days of supply than every other study
segment.  In fact, PC factories have reduced "work-in-
progress" and "finished goods" inventories to less than one
week of supply each.

"Supply-line management," known in the old days as
"purchasing," has become an important new tool for gaining a
competitive advantage.  PRTM's study reveals that supply-line
practices are changing dramatically, providing companies with
new ways to speed production, save money and improve
quality.  As an example, in 1995, the average computer
company obtained 80% of its material from 22 suppliers, as
opposed to 31 suppliers in 1992.  These companies are also
phasing out cumbersome paper-based ordering mechanisms: 
27% of transactions are now completed by EDI, compared to
12% in 1992.  In addition, companies are replacing time-
consuming inspection efforts with vendor certification
programs:  in 1995, 82% of incoming material lots were
received without inspection, an increase from 65% i 1992. 
Although changes in supply-line practices are industry-wide,
some companies are far ahead of the pack on the issue of
supply-line flexibility.  In the computer sector, best-in-class
companies needed only 20 days to achieve an unplanned 20%
increase in production, while median companies needed 56
days.  These same best-in-class companies can also more
easily adjust to a downturn, sustaining an average 94% order
reduction within 45 days of scheduled product delivery with
no inventory or cost penalty.  The average company can only
sustain a 20% reduction for the same amount of time. 
Companies that can't respond quickly to changes in the
marketplace run the risk of out-of-control inventory and lost
revenue.

WORLD'S FIRST SM RESETTABLE FUSE FOR TELECOM EQUIPMENT


Raychem's PolySwitch Division (Menlo Park, CA) announced
the world's first surface mount resettable fuse for
telecommunications equipment.  The new PolySwitch TS250
helps protect telecommunications equipment from overcurrent
conditions.  With an installed height of only 3.4 mm and a 9.0
mm by 7.1 mm footprint, the compact TS250 resettable fuse
has a 60% lower profile than previous through-hole
PolySwitch devices for telecommunications equipment.  Like
other SM parts that Raychem manufactures, the TS250 is
supplied in tape and reel that is compatible with standard
industry pick and place equipment in high-volume
manufacturing environments.  The part is designed to be
reflowed onto boards using convection, IR, and hot-air
techniques.  PolySwitch resettable fuses are designed to
operate repeatedly and reliably.  Unlike one-use fuses, they
automatically reset after a fault condition is cleared.  When
short circuits or overcurrent conditions occur, a conductive
polymer, sandwiched between two metal electrodes, increases
in resistance, limiting the current.  In this high resistance state,
the device remains latched until the fault clears.  Resetting
occurs when the power is interrupted and the fault is removed. 
The device then cools and enables the polymer to revert to a
conductive state.  The TS250 is priced as low as $0.35
depending on volume.  Lead times are six to eight weeks.

AVX ADDS 2 MLCC LINES


One of the mainstay passive components, along with the
resistor, is the capacitor, whose primary responsibility in
today's electronic circuits is as a decoupling device:  a shunt
used to maintain proper voltage levels within the circuit. 
Switching power supplies, ubiquitous elements in an
electronic circuit, are an important application area for
capacitors.  As power supplies increase in switching frequency
and decrease in size, designers are turning to specialized
multilayer ceramic chip (MLCC) capacitors to help them keep
control of the circuit.  The input filter of a high-speed power
supply must provide a high-current burst to the power supply
without generating noise, and must suppress noise generated
by the switch circuitry as well.  Output filtering capacitors
must smooth the ripple effect of the switching circuitry by
absorbing and then discharging energy during the switching
cycle.

In response to demand from designers working with advanced
power supplies, AVX Corp. (Myrtle Beach, SC)  introduced
two surface mount capacitor series:

  1.  SupraCap--high-capacitance MLCCs

  2.  SV--high-voltage radial MLCCs

The SupraCaps offer low equivalent series resistance (ESR) in
the milliohm range and equivalent series inductance (ESI) in
the 1-nanohenry (nH) to 4-nH range.  The SV is for high
voltage, low leakage current, and low ESR applications in a
small package.

MLCC MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS


Most of the raw-material cost in multilayer ceramic capacitors
comes from palladium.  As a result of the rising cost of
palladium, many ceramic-capacitor suppliers are considering
alternatives such as nickel.  Ceramics made of nickel, the inner
electrode could now account for as much as 10% of Murata's
ceramic-capacitor business.  Aluminum-electrolytic capacitors,
in heavy demand from power-supply makers, are in short
supply, as is polycarbonate.  New materials that are being
investigated to replace some of those that are in short supply
include polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) and
polyethyleneaphthalate (PEN).  (PPS is used in applications
requiring stability at high temperatures or over a wide
temperature range; PEN is appealing because it can be dipped
in molten solder in the wave solder process.)

ATC RAMPS UP FOR MLCC DEMAND


During the past two years American Technical Ceramics
(ATC) (Huntington Station, NY) saw an unprecedented
demand for multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs),
particularly for commercial and communications applications. 
In 1995 the company made significant investments to upgrade
production and process equipment for manufacturing their
core products--RF/microwave porcelain and ceramic
multilayer capacitors.  End-users of their products include
engineers in industries as diverse as wireless communications,
aircraft radar, navigation systems, satellite broadcasting,
medical electronics, space programs and automotive
electronics.

CAPACITOR NETWORKS ON THE RISE


New miniaturization demands are forcing many capacitor
houses to turn to integrated, semiconductor-style silicon
networks to achieve further reductions.  Size, performance,
and pricing are becoming increasingly critical, and surface-
mount packaging and thin-film technology are making inroads. 
A sizable chunk of future passives business could go to such
devices, particularly for portable communications and similar
applications where size reduction is critical.  PC manufacturers
want 100% surface mount.  The whole trend in the industry is
to surface mount for PCMCIA.  New high-frequency
requirements for communications and computing are making
such parts more necessary all the time.  Koa Speer has the
CR73 capacitor/resistor chip, a 1206 size for surface mount.

The passive-networks market--made up of various thick and
thin-film resistor-network configurations as well as resistor-
capacitor networks--grew moderately during the early 1990s. 
Venture Development Corp. (Natick, MA) said U.S. shipments
of the products grew from $1993.7 million in 1988, to $250.8
million in 1993.  A resurgence in the computer industry,
coupled with an interest in surface-mount designs, has helped
the passive-networks market maintain modest growth.  The
form factor continues to shrink.  Under development are
QSOPs, TSOPs, and narrow-body SO designs.  Small form
factors mean passive networks are offered, increasingly, in
surface-mount packages.  The mix of surface-mount and
through-hole resistor networks is currently about 50-50.  But
future designs are leaning more toward surface-mount
packages.

The name of the game is reducing size and increasing
frequency.  Performance level of surface-mount devices--in
some cases--has been close to or equal to that of through-hole
technology.  The biggest reason for the shift to surface-mount
is ease of assembly and size.  Applications that require high
levels of integration, such as cellular phones and wireless
communications, can generally be served better by discrete
components.  Traditionally, networks have three or maybe
four major applications:  pull-up/pull-down, termination,
current limiting, and precision analog circuits.  Applications in
which there is a need for low noise and tight tolerances,
however, require thin-film resistor networks, a portion of the
passive-networks market that should gain momentum in the
next few years.

Thin film has room to grow, especially where you can
incorporate a resistor and a capacitor in a single package.  The
market for thin-film resistor-capacitor networks is still in its
infancy, but most suppliers believe it shows great promise.  It
may still be about a year and a half before demand for these
integrated networks begins to generate much activity.

POROUS SILICONINCREASES CAPACITOR PERFORMANCE


Present-day capacitors suffer several drawbacks.  Electrodes
made of dielectric materials such as polystyrene or SiO2 have a
low surface-to-volume ratio.  Increasing the electrode area by
etching or sintering techniques such as those used for
aluminum or tantalum capacitors suffers the disadvantages of
anodically formed oxides.  The strong temperature and
electric-field dependence of the dielectric constant in ceramic
devices remains a drawback.  To resolve the limitations of
standard capacitors, porous silicon technology has been
developed by Siemens (Munich, Germany) to fashion novel
capacitors by combining an electrochemically enlarged
electrode surface with high-performance dielectric thin-film
layers.  The macroporous silicon, that was used as a substrate
for capacitors, has pores with a diameter in the micrometer
regime and a depth of several hundred micrometers.  Using a
standard microelectronic process, the capacitor structure is
completed with the deposition of dielectric films and a
polysilicon electrode.  In principle, the electrochemical
process allows the pore diameter to be reduced to values close
to atomic dimensions.  Reducing lateral dimensions in this
way would increase the specific capacitance to values around
20 mFV/mm3.  This would surpass the values for the best
tantalum or aluminum electrolytic capacitors without the
polarity and high-ESR drawbacks of these technologies.

PCMCIA DESIGN REQUIRE FLEXIBILITY


One of the products that helped make 1996 such a good year
for the electronics industry was the PCMCIA card.  Since the
1992 introduction of the first FPGAs, in thin quad flat pack
(TQFP) packages, static RAM-based FPGAs have been used
successfully in hundreds of PCMCIA designs, including
memory cards, I/O cards, and host systems.  The biggest
challenge of PCMCIA card designs is to fit the required
functionality into the available space.  High-integration levels
are needed to meet size and power constraints.  As a result, the
most popular PCMCIA IC technologies feature high
integration levels and include memories, chip sets, custom
ASICs (including gate arrays), and FPGAs.  Application-
specific approaches allow for the customization of the bus
interface and integration of other logic.  Custom IC
development is only feasible, however, when the design is
fixed and fairly large volumes are required.  This is because
such development typically involves lengthy design and
procurement cycles and high engineering costs.

As a result, many designers have turned to FPGAs, which
provide high integration levels without the lengthy
development cycles, design risk, and expenses of custom
ASICs.  Furthermore, the flexible nature of in-system
programmable FPGAs meets the demands of an unsettled PC
card market, with its changing standards, fierce competition,
and short product life cycles.  FPGA densities range from
about 1000 to over 20,000 gates with larger devices coming. 
The CMOS technology of FPGA devices is inherently low-
power.  One benefit of SRAM-based FPGA technology is its
ability to be configured and reconfigured while resident in the
target system.  This flexibility helps shorten development
times and facilitates field upgrades.

SRAM-based FPGAs make the PC Card more adaptable. 
Different FPGA configurations can be applied to the same
hardware design; variations in the FPGA configurations, result
in different adaptations of the same card.  Allowing for the
thickness of the circuit board and card enclosure leaves only
1.2 and 2.0 mm for ICs on double-sided Type I and Type II
cards, respectively.  This imposes severe restrictions on the
IC-package size, and has led to the adoption of TQFP and
VQFP (very thin quad flat pack) packaging for FPGAs. 
TQFPs feature a package height of 1.6 mm, making them
suitable for single-sided Type I cards and single or double-
sided Type 2 cards.  With 1.2-mm height, VQFPs can be used
on all single- or double-sided PCMCIA boards.  (Package
height is defined as the distance from the surface of the board
to the top of the IC package, and is the sum of the package
thickness and its clearance off the board.)  For high-density,
high-pin-count FPGA designs, Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs), just
emerging, offer a nominal height of 2.0 mm, suiting them for
PCMCIA designs.

The U.S. semiconductor market is dominated by
microprocessor and logic manufacturers, both standard logic
and ASICs.  Intel is the largest manufacturer by far.  Some
memory is produced mostly is the form EEPROMs.  Because
of the preponderance of MPUs and logic chips produced in the
United States, there tend to be more QFPs, PGAs, and LCCs
used proportionally, compared to the Asian market, where
there would be a higher proportion of DIPs, ZIPs, SIPs, and
SOIC packages used for memory applications.

HARRIS TO STICK TO X86S


Although Harris Corp. (Dallas, TX) was said to be evaluating
the possibility of migrating to the next generations of X86
processors, right now they are still dedicated to their decade-
old 8086 and 286 product lines.  A spokesman said:  "We've
been making these parts for many, many years now, but we're
seeing demand increase to the point that we've had to go back
in and re-allocate fab capacity, and we are investing
significant money in new speed upgrades and package types." 
Including the processors and peripheral devices, such as timer
circuits and direct-memory-access controller, Harris sold more
than 5 million of the 8086 and 286 devices in 1995.  Among
the new package options Harris is adding to its 8086 and 286
product lines, are surface-mount packages.

INTEL SHIFTS TO PLASTIC PACKAGES


Some years ago one of the pundits we talk to periodically said
that packages of the future, despite what was being said then,
would be eventually be plastic.  Intel went a long way toward
confirming that recently when it made some of  the biggest
news around by saying it will migrate the majority of its
microprocessor product line from ceramic to plastic packages. 
By moving to plastic, Intel will spend $29.50 less on each
microprocessor and be able to reduce the cost of the products. 
As much as 80% of Intel's microprocessors are now packaged
in ceramic.  The move to plastic was made possible by the
superb heat and power dissipation characteristics of Intel's
0.35-micron process.

OLE 2.0 AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN ECAD & MRP II 


Simple tools are the best tools.  Think of the extremely
qualitative work that can be done by an artist with simple paint
and ordinary canvas.  When two or more pieces of software
can interact in a simple manner it opens a previously narrow
gap by which the operators of the software can move data with
positive consideration for the task.  Consequently, an
individual can more easily motivate himself to take on a more
arduous task.  This in turn helps the overall data stream
between the engineering department and the manufacturing
and/or the administrative departments of a company.  OLE
provides this linkage and widens the gap.

An engineering group can spend a significant amount of their
time trying to get information and documentation about an
assembly to manufacturing.  Perceptively, much of this
information is going to be entered into the company's MRP
software quickly and accurately.  OLE does this without any
manual intervention.  Therefore, an MRP system, having been
defined as an infinite planning system, can immediately
breakout the materials required to start this project into motion
with rapid precision.  Now that the work orders and materials
can be generated, the aspect of more finite costing can be
established.  With this information now assigned a  new role, it
can quickly generate purchase orders and work orders.

A digital circuit board with 20 square inches of real estate can
easily have over 300 discrete parts.  They may not necessarily
all be different, but here must be a bill of materials and they
will all have different reference designators.  Coupled with all
the other information that is needed to define a circuit board
there is a wealth of data needed to clearly define the project to
other persons inside the company and out.  OLE keeps this
data from having to be reproduced.  As in a reference
designator chart of those 300 parts for hand placement, rework
or test.  When this data does not have to be retyped the
engineering staff and the administrative staff can manage a
project more efficiently.  This in turn would benefit by the
lowering the cost of not having to maintain multiple data
bases.  This allows purchasing and scheduling to utilize the
MRP system much earlier in the design cycle.  Manufacturing
can now start to consider what the capacity constraining
resource is and the production path to be taken.

When a single database can be maintained, the allowance for
multiple individuals to access this information with the
perception that it is accurate and updated frequently is
generated.  This is the basis for a concurrent engineering
environment with minimal redundancy.  With all this
happening in rapid succession, the model of the product also
needs to be created, which is why OLE Design and Modeling
is going to be an important factor for the MCAD group to keep
pace with the ECAD systems.

DESIGN TOOLS TARGET BGA AND PCB APPLICATIONS


Two new physical-design packages from Harris EDA (Fishers,
NY) target ball-grid-array (BGA) and PC-board applications. 
The first product, Encore BGA, is aimed at single- and few-
chip designs using BGA packaging technology.  Encore PCB
is a physical design and layout environment for PC boards. 
Encore BGA was developed in partnership with Amkor
Electronics, a leading packaging supplier.  Users can reduce
design time, improve manufacturability, and reduce
manufacturing costs.  The tool includes automatic, optimized
wire-bound generation and no-net-list, all-angle, filleted trace
routing.

Push-and-shove editing allows engineers to dynamically re-
route traces on the substrate.  All-angle routing and advanced
editing features ensure that all available space is used.  And
Encore BGA comes with a standard set of BGA design rules to
make the tool easy for first-time and casual users, while still
allowing for a high degree of user configurability if desired. 
Encore PCB lets users design, analyze, and optimize PC-board
designs.  User-specified design rules guide floorplanning,
partitioning, and manual placement.  In addition, floorplanning
lets users consider electrical constraints and manufacturability
issues in the early design stages.

Using a physical-synthesis option, users can automatically
derive component placement and interconnect from CAE data
and user-specified constraints.  Partition synthesis
automatically optimizes component groups, partitions, and
individual component assignment.  Placement synthesis
employs placement algorithms that consider constraints such
as clearance rules, voids, and channels, while minimizing
route congestion and interconnect lengths.  Encore BGA and
Encore PCB run on Unix platforms and work with leading
CAE design software, including products from Cadence,
Mentor and Viewlogic.  Encore PCB also works with popular
PC-based design systems.  Pricing starts at $25,000 for each
product.

TITANIUM OXIDE FILM BINDS IC LAYERS


A lightweight metal best known for its use in advanced aircraft
structures may provide the adhesive needed to hold together
groups of integrated circuits in multichip modules -- and the
layers of material used to build high-speed circuits.  Multichip
modules will facilitate the miniaturization of computer
equipment by allowing several chips to be placed in the same
space now needed for a single integrated circuit. To improve
the operating speed of the circuits and the new modules and
allow use of smaller currents, electrical engineers would like
to use wiring patterns made from high-conductivity metals
such as silver, gold or copper -- instead of standard aluminum.

But those high-conductivity metals are usually difficult to use
in circuits because other electronic materials -- silicon dioxide
and polymers -- do not bond well to them.  Now, researchers
at the Georgia Institute of Technology report that a thin film of
titanium oxide can serve as an intermediary layer to help bond
films of high conductivity gold to the other materials used to
build an integrated circuit.  The research is sponsored by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
through the U.S. Air Force.

"This will allow us to think about replacing aluminum on
integrated circuits with a more conductive material such as
copper, gold or silver," explained Dr. Paul A. Kohl, professor
of chemical engineering at Georgia Tech. "This process may
be of substantial value in integrated circuit and multichip
module technology."

Aluminum has long been used for wiring in integrated circuits
because it forms a stable insulating oxide to which other
electronic materials readily bond. But metals like gold and
silver -- which are better conductors -- do not readily form
stable oxides and therefore are more difficult to use in layering
the circuits.

Kohl and Graduate Student Kirkland W. Vogt believe they
have solved that problem by depositing a thin film of titanium
metal on top of gold conducting films. The titanium adheres
well to the gold, and is then allowed to form an insulating
oxide (TiO2) on which the researchers can build layers of
silicon dioxide or polymers.

"It's a simple one-step coating process that allows us to switch
back and forth between insulators and metals at will without
having to worry about adhesion for each," explained Kohl. "In
our work with multichip modules, we use this exclusively to
get adhesion. It's a kind of universal adhesion layer for us."

Because it is thin, the titanium film does not alter the dielectric
properties of the insulator surrounding the metal. And because
it does not significantly diffuse into the gold, conductivity is
not degraded.  Vogt analyzed the surface of the titanium layer
with help from Dr. Lawrence A. Bottomley in Georgia Tech's
School of Chemistry and Dr. Brent Carter in the School of
Materials Science and Engineering. Using angle-resolved
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and other techniques, he studied the
characteristics of the titanium oxide film and found that its
thickness was critical to the success of the process.

When deposited in layers of between three and 10 Angstroms
thick on the gold film, the titanium forms "islands" which
occupy about 90 percent of the surface -- but do not contact
one another. Oxidation of the titanium metal creates a
continuous film of insulating titanium oxide, which builds up
on top of the titanium islands and provides a bonding surface
for the next layer of the circuit.  A core of titanium metal
remains beneath the oxide to provide good adhesion to the
gold.

If the titanium layer is thinner than three Angstroms, oxidation
does not leave enough titanium to ensure good adhesion, Vogt
found. If the layer is thicker than about 30 Angstroms, the
titanium islands grow together, forming a continuous metal
layer that can become a conductor and short out the circuit. 
Multichip modules will allow the miniaturization of computer
components by allowing several integrated circuits to be
placed into a single package in the space normally required for
just one circuit. 

"This can replace several packages of chips inside a
computer," Kohl explained. "All the interconnection is
provided on the base material, so you end up with a very dense
array of circuits."

Engineers would like to use the higher conductivity metals to
increase the speed of the circuits and to reduce the current they
must carry. Because the chips are closer together, the electrons
carrying signals have less distance to travel; helping them
travel faster would give additional speed to the computing
work. Higher conductivity would also mean less current loss
and less heat to remove from the circuit module.

CHANGES IN TODAY'S PCB MARKET


The printed circuit board (PCB) market, like all the electronics
industry, is in a state of continual evolution.  Some of the
major outside factors that have helped shape that evolution
are:

  1.  The shift from a military and mainframe dominated
market to a commercial product focus;
  2.  The movement away from vertical integration and captive
PCB shops to independent PCB fabricators and independent
contract assemblers;
  3.  The slow but steady move from through-hole technology
to surface mount technology; and
  4.  The rapidly increasing levels of density and integration on
semiconductor devices.

From a technological standpoint, the basic processes used
today are the same that were used twenty years ago.  Clearly
there have been steady improvements in materials, proprietary
chemicals, equipment and our understanding of PCB
processing.  Nonetheless, there has been little change in how
PCBs are processed today compared to twenty years ago. 
Layers are still imaged, etched and laminated.  Next comes
drilling, metalization, imaging, etch and finishing.

It is clear that change will be needed in the future!  The
transition from through-hole to surface mount technology
provided an easy route to increased interconnection density. 
Replacing large holes that served a mechanical and electrical
function with small connection vias freed up routing channels. 
Combined with enhanced dimensional stability of laminates,
smaller line widths and spaces, stiff and accurate drill
machines, fine grained tungsten-carbide drills, and the ability
to scale artwork with raster-based laser photoplotters--large
improvements have been made.  The result has been a five to
ten fold increase in interconnect density over the past twenty
years.  Nonetheless, the easy changes have been made. 
Further enhancements on the present methods of building
PCBs will result in diminishing returns.  The industry is ripe
for a change, but a change to what?

Today it is obvious that the density improvements in the PCB
fabrication industry are not keeping pace with those of the
semiconductor industry.  Semiconductors serve only an
electrical purpose.  Shrinking their geometries usually
improves the electrical properties and results in more die and
more revenue per wafer.  Printed circuit boards serve both an
electrical and a mechanical purpose that is difficult to separate. 
Frequently, the mechanical size is dictated by a form factor,
making it impossible to shrink the overall board size, while at
the same time, the geometries decrease and the cost per square
inch increases.

What is needed is a new PCB technology that allows very high
connection densities (where needed) without driving the cost
of the rest of the package out of sight!  Fortunately, there are
many new technologies that exhibit the potential for greatly
increased interconnection densities.  Some of the most
promising of these new processing methods and materials are:

  1.  Photoimagable dielectrics,
  2.  All organic dielectric materials in which vias can be
chemically or reactive ion etched,
  3.  Electrically conductive pastes for filling vias,
  4.  Lasers that can simultaneously machine thousands of vias,
and
  5.  Lasers that can machine through copper.

Most of these emerging technologies are squarely aimed at
reducing the high cost of via formation when using small drills
for conventional through-board via formation.  Secondary
benefits are that these processes allow the use of much smaller
via pads; They only place vias between the required layer pairs
(opening up routing channels on all other layers), and they
allow the use of optical alignment fiducials for improved
layer-to-layer alignment, further reducing the required via pad
size.

The challenges facing the acceptance of any new PCB
fabrication technology are:

  1.  It must be producible on large panel sizes, i.e., 300-500
sq. in.;
  2.  It must provide reliability that is at least equal to existing
semiconductor packages;
  3.  It must be compatible with existing semiconductor
assembly and packaging processes; and
  4.  Any increased processing and material costs must be less
than the increased density on a per unit area.

ELECTROLESS PALLADIUM: A SURFACE FINISH FOR INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGY


With the continuous evolution of interconnect technology a
series of new demands on the  surface finish is emerging.  The
co-planarity of the surface finish is essential for paste printing
accuracy and placement on fine featured SMT devices.  The
finish must be capable of withstanding multiple thermal
excursions in air without loss of solderability.  Preferably the
same finish is also compatible with wire bonding and contact
switching.  Electroless palladium over bare copper can meet
the above requirements.  It is  cost competitive and
environmentally safe.  Electroless palladium eliminates the use
of lead in the PCB manufacturing facility and is compatible
with no-clean fluxes at the assembly end.

Atotech developed a process that uses a novel reducing agent
that produces an electroless deposit of pure palladium that is
free of phosphorous or boron, eliminating variability in the
deposit and its solderability.  An electroless palladium coating
of 5-7 microinches (0.15 microns) over bare copper has 
excellent solderability preserving properties.  It is compatible
with no clean fluxes after  multiple thermal excursions in air. 
At a thickness of 20-24 microinches (0.5- 0.6 microns) with a
gold flash (0.1 microns)  the finish is 100% gold wire
bondable.

Palladium has a density of 12gm/cm and a melting point of
1552oC. Palladium is almost twice as hard as copper; it has a
hardness of 250-290 Vickers as compared to copper at 150
Vickers.  On the same scale gold is at 90 and nickel comes in
at a hardness of 600 Vickers.  Palladium will not form a solid
solution in copper even with prolonged dwell at elevated
temperatures (120 and 176o C for 48 hours).  The metal will
strip in molten solder at a rate of 0.02 microns per second at
250 and 176o  C.  Copper at the same temperature has a strip
rate of 0.12 microns and gold is at 1.3 microns per sec.

Atotech's process consists of four steps:  

  1.  Acid Clean;
  2.  Microetch;
  3.  Activate; and 
  4.  Electroless palladium.  

The activator is highly selective to the copper surface. The
process uses the copper surface as a reducing agent for the
deposition of a thin layer (1.0 microinches) of immersion
palladium.  Activation depends on temperature and chemical
composition.  The system is buffered to the point that pH
control is not required.  A controller maintains the chemical
composition and doses the bath continuously during operation. 
The electroless bath will only deposit on a palladium metal
surface.  This surface is initiated in the activation step. The
deposited metal then acts as the catalytic sight for sustained
plating.  This unique feature renders the bath totally
independent of bath loading.  The thickness of the palladium is 
a function of dwell time beyond this point.  Of course
deposition rate is dependant on temperature, chemical
composition and pH.  A controller maintains the chemistry
within the specified range.  The bath is water clear, odorless
and very stable under operating conditions.  

At the operating temperature and pH the bath is compatible
with all the solder masks  tested to date.  The list includes the
following:  Probimer 52,62; Conformask 2000; Taiyo PSR400;
Enthone 3241LG; Coates XZT15; Vacrel; Epic 200 and
Imagecure XV 501 TSM.  Multiple tests were conducted to
evaluate the solderability of a thin electroless palladium finish. 
Thicknesses tested were 0.2 microns and 0.1 microns. Test
conditions were steam aging, multiple IR thermal excursions
and baking.  Four different assembly fluxes were used  namely
Alpha 350(2%), Kester 951(2%), Kester 922(2%) and Alpha
855(15%).  Soldermasks tested were; Probimer 52, Probimer
71, Enthone 3241ALG and Taiyo 4000.  The finish with a
thickness as  low as 4.0 microinches (0.1 microns) survived
eight hours of steam aging. The resulting surface gave good
hole filling properties when assembled with a 2% no clean
flux in air.  No loss of solderablity was experienced after three
IR thermal excursions.  No loss of solderability was detected
after 24 hours of dry bake at 160 and 176o C.  No clean fluxes
in an air atmosphere were used in all applications.

Boards coated with 0.7 microns of palladium were assembled
using standard reflow and wave procedures.  Cross sections of
the joint were then prepared.  EDX was used to study the
elemental composition at; the solder/copper interface, at 2
microns and at 5 microns into the solder.  EDX analyses were
conducted on; the joint as formed, after baking and after 1000
thermal cycles.  From the data it is evident that  an
intermetallic phase between tin and palladium is set up as the
joint is formed.  This phase then migrates during tempering
into the solder away from the copper. This allows for  the
formation of a copper/tin intermetallic at the copper surface.
The palladium/tin phase forms a neutral solid solution in the
solder away from the copper interface.

A palladium deposit 0.6-0.7 microns thick with immersion
gold flash over bare copper was submitted for gold wire bond
testing.  Coupons with surface mount assembly sites were
used.  The coupons were split into two groups. One group was
assembled through reflow, using water soluble solder paste
followed by aqueous cleaning.  The second group, a control
group, was processed as received.  A bead of die attach epoxy
was placed around the bond site and was cured per vendor
specifications.  All assemblies were then plasma cleaned using
argon gas.

A Hughes Aircraft wire bonder was used.  The bonder
employed a stage preheat.  The gold wire had a diameter of 1.0
mil. Pull strengths were performed per MIL-STD-883B.  The
results show that average pull strength was 8.4 gms with a
S.D. of 0.46 for the control group and 8.2 gms for the
assembled group with a S.D. of 0.43.  The brake per
MIL-STD-883B had a Failure Location Code 1 (wire break at
neck down point).  Additional testing is in progress to
evaluate; alternate assembly equipment, palladium without
gold flash and to optimize wire bonding parameters.  Contact
switch testing was conducted on a 0.2 microns palladium
deposit over bare copper.  Initially 200,000 switches were
performed at a pressure of 80 cN. This was followed by a
dwell in a humidity chamber for 4 days at 85 & 176o C and
85% relative humidity.  An additional 400,000 switches were
then performed at the same pressure. No increase in resistivity
was recorded throughout the testing conditions.

Under normal thermal stress both nickel/gold and palladium
deposits showed no deterioration in resistivity . At increased
stress temperature of 155 and 176o C palladium shows no
significant increase in resistivity for 28 hours.  Nickel/gold on
the other hand showed an increase of 300% after 16 hours. 
Under chemical stress conditions of 10 ppm H2S for 60 hours
no change was recorded for palladium. Nickel/gold exhibited a
30% increase in resistivity.  For the palladium deposit to show
the same rise in resistivity it was necessary to increase the
concentration of the gas H2S to 100 ppm and the dwell time  to
144 hours.

Electroless palladium is an economical, environmentally safe
surface finish. It does not require any modifications to existing
assembly operations. The finish has great versatility and a
multitude of applications.  As a diffusion barrier it may replace
electrolytic nickel for gold tab electroplating applications. 
Can 25 microinches of electroless palladium replace
nickel/gold tab plating and offer a final finish that is
solderable, wire bondable and suitable for contact switching? 
How about electroless palladium on ceramic substrates? 
Electroless palladium offers answers to existing technology
demands and will be at the forefront to meet the challenges of
future technological advancements.

PRECISION STENCILS FOR SMT ASSEMBLY


A-Laser, Inc. (Beaverton, OR) announced a new service
providing laser cut stencils for the printing of solder paste on
circuit boards (PCBs) when using fine pitch surface mount
components.  The new service takes advantage of laser
technology to manufacture stencils that improve SMT
assembly yields by drastically reducing print errors.

With fine pitch technology becoming more pervasive in
surface mount designs the need for precision stencils is
increasing.  The component solder points for these fine pitch
parts have become so small and closely aligned, A-Laser feels,
that the accuracy needed cannot be met any longer by
traditional chemical stencil manufacturing technology.

A-Laser uses a stencil laser system manufactured by LPKF
CAD/CAM Systems that was specifically developed for
stencil fabrication.  The laser system creates stencil apertures
with very clean, straight walls which allow printing of clean,
precise solder paste islands.  High aperture positioning
accuracy (<15 m) combined with low inner wall roughness
(<3  m) permit trouble-free fine-pitch PCB assembly, for
pitches finer than 250  m (10 mil).

Stencils are generated from common data formats such as
Gerber and HPGL.  The typical stencil is made of flat stainless
steel, up to 60 x 80 cm (24" x 32"), in a range of thicknesses,
typically from 50-250  m (2-10 mils).  Typical turnaround
times are three to five days and the cost starts at $275 per
stencil without frame and about $400 per stencil with frame. 
First time customers receive a 50% discount on their first order
of a standard stencil.  To receive a free information packet,
call (503-641-9428) or FAX (503-643-3662).

AMISTAR INTRODUCES TP-12


Amistar Corp. (San Marcos, CA) has introduced its new
TrayPro TP-12, a multiple-tray feeder for the PlacePro family
of surface mount assembly equipment.  The TrayPro TP-12 is
capable of handling up to 12 JEDEC trays on two platforms. 
A special feature of this tray feeder is that while the machine
is picking a component from one platform, the other platform
can be re-loaded or re-configured by the operator, saving
valuable time.  The trays can be easily changed out, even
while the machine is in operation.  Utilizing a simple
mechanical latching arrangement, the TrayPro TP-12 offers a
solution to handling large numbers of tray-fed components. 
The TrayPro TP-12 takes full advantage of the PlacePro's four-
head models allowing multiple, simultaneous pick-up of
memory devices.  This efficient methodology means high
production at an affordable cost-per-placement.  The TrayPro
TP-12 is especially effective for manufacturing memory
modules because multiple waffle trays of DRAMs can be
handled very efficiently with the PlacePro machines.

DIE-TECH INTRODUCES NEW SUBSTRATE HANDLING SYSTEMS


Die-Tech, Inc. (York Haven, PA) has introduced a package
handling system that transfers devices through multiple
operations without the operator having to handle them directly. 
The Model 6502 Substrate Handling system can process quad
flat packs, DIPs, or SIPs in 12" long stainless steel "boat." 
Each boat holds multiple devices, the number depending upon
the size of the component.  There are 10 boats in each
magazine.  The standard unit comes with a double magazine,
and can be equipped with as many as four.  The basic system
includes two vertical travel elevators, which lower the boats
onto the main track of the machine.  Once the substrates
complete the desired processes, the boats are then loaded back
into a magazine by means of the outgoing travel elevator. 
These magazines can then be transferred to other stations for
additional work, such as reflow, trim and form, testing,
marking and inspection.  The system can also be used to
automate wire bonding, epoxy dispensing, paste dispensing,
and component placement.  Pricing for a Model 6502
Substrate Handling System, incorporated into a custom Die-
Tech Model 4602 DIP machine with double magazine, boat
transfer, lead attach and solder paste dispensing, is
approximately $250,000.

1995 was a good year for manufacturers of screen printers for
SMT.  Much of the highest growth in the market came from
contract manufacturers.  End-users are looking for increased
performance features that will make their screen printing more
automatic to stepup throughput.  One of the additions to the
screen printer that is helping to speed up the operation is a
vision system.  Vision systems help insure the proper
alignment of the screen as well as check the completed board
to make sure all patterns have been properly applied.

MASK TECHNOLOGY SIGNS CROSS LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH KOKI


Mask Technology, Inc.  (Santa Ana, CA) and Koki  Company Ltd.   (Tokyo, Japan)
announced the signing of a cross licensing agreement relating to the Precision
Pad Technology (PPT) solid  solder deposit  process.   Both Koki  and Mask Tek
will be opening PPT service bureaus in Tokyo and Santa Ana, in addition to the
existing Mask Technology PPT facility in Orlando, FL.  The patented technology
is claimed to improve fine pitch solderability by applying  a solid, reflowed,
macro- planar solder deposit to SMT lands or pads.   The  solid solder deposit
formed is typically  0.002-inch to  0.010-inch, although  thinner deposits are
normally employed for TAB devices.  

Mask Tek has been doing solder masking for nearly a decade and a half.  Their
PPT process grew out of this expertise.  They began obtaining patents for the
PPT process four years ago.  Seven months ago, with their last patent in hand,
they began to push the PPT process as a service.  Initially, the service was
offered only in Orlando.  Now the Santa Ana site as well as the Tokyo site
also offer the service.  What is eliminated by using the service is the
printing of solder paste.  Solder paste printing, like board fabrication, is
ordered by the end-user.  Generally, the entire board is processed, but it can
be just parts of the board, if there are certain hard to place components in a
particular area.

When the processed board reaches the assembler or OEM a flux is applied to the
board, either by dispensing, stencil or spray.  Components are then place and
the board is reflowed.  Peel strength is increased with the PPT process, while
shorts and bridges are virtually eliminated.  The savings in rework, the
company says, justifies the cost of the process.  The PPT cost is typically
$0.05 per square inch of board, plus the cost of the stencil.

WHO WHAT IN PLACEMENT


Nothing in market research is more vain than trying to
determine marketshare.  It's easy enough to figure out who are
the major competitors, harder by a great deal to determine
exactly what share of the market these major competitors
possess.  In placement the task is even more daunting because
the market itself can be segmented into three, maybe four,
maybe five different categories, based on chip placement
speed (CPS) or cost.  With that caveat, we put forth our ideas
on this dubious area.  We will, over the course of time, refine
these numbers, both as the market shifts and as our
participation in the market deepens and allows us more
accurate perceptions of what is really going on.  Now we must
rely on information that is probably hedged because
marketshare figures are extremely vague unless based on unit
sales, and few SMT placement manufacturers have a
relationship with us, yet, that gives them the confidence to
release these figures.


We include this information because we feel that major
players in the market are important, which is not to say minor
players are not important.  But the research and product
development at a major company is more likely to influence
the nature of the SMT market more than the research and
product development at a minor company.  As always, we are
looking for answers for people actively involved in PCB
assembly using surface mount components.  When, in the
months to come, we discuss work being done at Fuji or
Universal, it will be because we feel as if this work is
something that will benefit you.

BGA BONDING UPGRADE KIT


The new ball grid array (BGA) kit from Kulicke & Soffa
Industries (Willow Grove, PA) enhances the bonding
capability of the model 1488L turbo automatic gold ball
bonder for handling ball grid arrays and other devices with
large or varying height differentials.  The BGA kit enhances
machine vision capability to focus more clearly on BGAs, for
more accurate and reliable bond placement.  BGA devices
typically have large die/lead height differentials, ranging from
0.41 to 0.56 mm.  By expanding machine vision range to 0.76
mm, the kit provides bonders with a sharper visual image of
BGAs, for clearer bond position targeting.  Stationary optics
eliminate the need for operator adjustments; focusing is
performed with out time-consuming mechanical motion,
maximizing UPH.  A loop trajectory also improves second
bond angle approach for reduced risk of contact with
ground/supply pads.  Greater loop control allows accurate
placement of second bonds in multiple rows for effective fine
pitch.  A new algorithm minimizes wire sweep and reduces the
risk of wires shorting when molding for higher yields.

SOLDERING EQUIPMENT


The U.S. market for soldering ovens, we feel, is going to
continue to be very healthy through the year 2000.  New
package types will keep end-users looking for good ovens.  In
addition, included in the category are curing ovens which will
find better acceptance during the next few years as the market
for conductive adhesives grows.  Prices will increase because
of added performance needed to provide reliable soldering of
fine pitch devices and dense array packages.

FLIP CHIP ATTACHMENT WITHOUT SOLDER 


Solderless flip chip technology is challenging the traditional solder bump
technique.  Solderless flip chip technology involves the deposition of a
screen-printable dielectric polymer onto the silicon chip in wafer form,
leaving the metallized bond pads open.  This process, called advanced wafer
passivation (AWP), utilizes high precision, automatic screen printers with
pattern recognition alignment.  The printer must be able to print the micron
range with acceptable resolution and repeatability.  After the dielectric is
cured, an electrically conductive polymer is stenciled onto the bond pads of
each chip on the wafer to form the interconnect bumps.

A 25 micron layer of dielectric polymer is stencil printed over the entire
surface of the wafer, excluding bond pads and streets.  A printer with vision
alignment is required because the bond pad size is typically 100 microns
square and the spacing between adjacent bond pads is usually 200 microns.  In
the second step of the process, the conductive bumps are formed.  A
laser-etched stencil, with the bond pad array etched open, is aligned to the
wafer bond pads.  The bump height is 50 microns (+/-3 microns).  The
conductive bumps are then cured in an infrared furnace with a nitrogen
atmosphere after which they are ready for assembly. 

A thin layer (0.001") of conductive adhesive is stenciled onto the bond pads
of the substrate.  A high precision printer employing a metal stencil is
mandatory so that interconnect height, volume and diameter can be accurately
controlled.  The flip chip is then aligned and amounted onto the substrate
using a flip chip aligner/bonder.  The bumps of the flip chip are contacted to
the wet adhesive on the metallized substrate pads and 30 to 40 gms is
typically used to adhere the flip chip to the substrate.  A 300X magnification
on the aligner/bonder is used to ensure accurate alignment of the bumps to the
substrate.  This is essential because conductive adhesives do not have the
self-aligning properties exhibited by solder.

SMT INSPECTION


Inspection is an increasingly important part of the entire PCB
processing when surface mount components are involved. 
Inspection equipment can be one of the most ubiquitous pieces
of equipment on the line.  Inspection equipment can be found
at the head of the line for incoming inspection of both printed
circuit boards and components, after solder paste screen
printing, after component placement, after reflow soldering,
and after cleaning.

An order of magnitudes' escalation in the cost of finding and
correcting a defect at each successive stage in the production
of an electronics system should turn a manufacturing
manager's thoughts to finding defective boards and
components early.  Checking for manufacturing defects in
circuit fabrication and assembly must await performance of the
physical process at issue.  Many component defects, however,
can be found at incoming inspection, when the components
enter the manufacturer's facility.

Probably the most important function of incoming parts
inspection is the detection of oxidation of the PWB traces. 
This is because the boards are exposed most often to
contaminants such as moisture and body oils.  They are
frequently shipped and stored without the packaging
precautions used for paste and components.  Components are
usually received in containers that prevent contamination
caused by handling or atmospheric exposure.  Solder paste
may be refrigerated and kept in sealed containers for use
within a few weeks after receipt.  Boards, however, may be
kept in inventory for several months.  Therefore, inspection for
oxidation should occur not only upon receiving them but also
before the boards enter the assembly process.

Inspection of the application of solder paste is the first step in
ensuring a good solder joint.  After printing solder paste onto
the pads, the process may require inspection of the wet solder
before components are placed.  This level of inspection
ensures that the correct amount of paste is located on the pads
within acceptable tolerances.  The kinds of problems
associated with faulty paste printing include solder bridging,
excessive print deposition, and whether the print registration is
off.  Insufficient solder paste can result in opens.  Unlevel
printing can lead to downline process problems such as
skewing or tombstoning.  Boards not printed to spec can be
removed from the line before there is any more value added. 
Equally important, the cause of the fault is identified so
corrective action can be taken.

After components are placed on the board, the assembly
should be inspected for correct component positional
tolerances including pattern error correction (PEC), lead
inspection, coplanarity inspection, and part-to-pad matching. 
Because of the greater density of these circuits, placement is
much more critical than with through-hole components.

The solder joint inspection process can be broken down into
two categories:

  1.  Pre-solder inspection; and
  2.  Post-solder inspection.

The objective of post-assembly, pre-solder inspection is to find
and replace wrong, misoriented, misplaced, and missing parts
at the most cost-effective point in the process.  The objective
of post-solder inspection is to assure sound solder joints
between component leads and pads on assembled PCBs. 
Some common defects occur after the components have been
soldered to the board.  Solder balls may form if boards are not
properly prepared or if paste is improperly applied.  The defect
is more common to vapor phase soldered boards.  Dewetting
or missing solder are easy to detect visually.  Solder bridges
and cracks are difficult to spot if they occur beneath a
component.

Defects occur which may not affect the performance of the
product immediately but which may degrade the long-term
reliability of the circuit.  Flux residues may cause corrosion or
the failure of a conformal coating.  Voids or pinholes may be
caused by gases formed during reflow or by flux which has
failed to escape from the solder before it hardens.  These will
rarely impede the functioning of the circuit but may affect its
long-term reliability, especially if the assembly is subjected to
vibration.

Included in the SMT inspection equipment market are
automatic and manual inspection equipment.  Manual systems,
which generally involve a microscope, perhaps with 3D
capability and a video camera and monitor, are most often
found at the end of the process line, where they are used to
inspect fully assembled PCBs.  A manual system necessarily
involves a technician whose judgement is used to evaluate the
quality of the board.  Manual systems are still very much in
use not only because of their lower cost but also, with well-
trained operators, they are very good systems for providing
assemblers with go or no-go judgements about boards.  

Automated systems include x-ray, laser, and automated optical
systems.  They involve "golden" board models which are used
to automatically compare boards being processed.  Automated
systems can be found throughout the process line.  Although
automated systems are used widely, because of their ability to
monitor boards during several phases of processing, they are
anything but perfect, and they are often very expensive.

BEYOND CFC


Last summer when we visited EMPF (Indianapolis, IN), one of
the bits of information we picked up was how many
companies were unaware of the Montreal agreement that lead
to the phasing out of CFC use in PCB cleaning.  The fact is,
we feel, that companies are trying to hold onto their CFC
cleaners as long as possible, and, in many cases, until someone
comes along and tells them to stop using them, they're going to
continue as in the past.  The difference, they are going to find,
is that they will have to recycle the cleaners that they do have,
that no new CFC will be on the market.  In addition, of course,
manufacturers of CFC-based cleaning systems have stopped
making those types of equipment and the market has gradually
moved toward other types of equipment.  There are, however,
other types of solvents that are being used and therefore the
market for solvent cleaners remains.  How long it will remain
depends on how good aqueous cleaners become and how
effective no-clean, fluxless solders become.

MEASURING PATTERNED IC LAYERS 


NIST researchers are developing techniques for measuring the
critical dimensions of patterned layers on integrated circuits.
The work involves theoretical projects on the formation of
images in the optical and scanning electron microscopes as
well as experimental and design projects on the construction of
new metrology instruments for the calibration of standards.
The project was initiated about 15 years ago at the request of
the semiconductor industry. 

The ever smaller dimensions on integrated circuits have
created a demand for new and improved techniques of
measurement and their related standards, especially as feature
sizes approach and become smaller than the wavelength of
light used in conventional optical metrology instruments. The
dimensions of present interest range from about 0.5
micrometers to 30 micrometers and will extend to smaller
dimensions in the future. A series of three line width/pitch
Standard Reference Materials for photomasks is presently in
production. Research is in progress to develop new and
improved standards for use in instruments utilizing optical or
scanning electron microscopy.

IRDAS DETECTS DEFECTS


Test- and quality-oriented engineering research suggests that a
unit under test can be compared to a "golden board" to identify
defective components.  When used in conjunction with
electronic test, this method can reduce the time for
troubleshooting and repairing a circuit.  But it does not address
other issues such as early lifetime component failure, poor
heat sinking or cold solder joints unless thermal output is
significantly different.

At the same time, simple comparison also highlights small
random variations in thermal output resulting from normal
production variations.  As a result, a test person has to make
value judgments to differentiate "acceptable" trouble spots
from real ones.

Motorola Information systems Group (ISG) in Mansfield, MA,
decided to develop a system that could detect circuit boards
that run outside an acceptable temperature threshold despite
passing traditional electronic test methods.  It also wanted a
system that would account for normal variations in thermal
output and thus eliminate arbitrary personal judgment from the
assessment process.  To do this, Motorola built a "model board
image" from the statistical mean of the thermal intensity
images of a large number of boards rather than the image of a
golden board.

The system, called IRDAS, for infrared defect analysis system,
comprises an IR camera interfaced to a UNIX workstation
(SUN Sparc 10/50 with Ethernet interface).  It uses General
Imaging Corp.'s software based upon that company's
ProtoPIPE Object-Oriented Grahical Programming
Environment.  The high-performance IR camera and
sophisticated signal/image-processing software have made this
technology available for the factory floor.

Motorola ISG tested the IRDAS system by developing mean
intensity images for each product type.  The IRDAS system
interfaces a fixture holding the test assemblies to the camera
and powers the assembly to ensure that images are captured at
precise times for analysis.  Three LEDs in the fixture shine
through tooling holes in the circuit to register the board images
during analysis.

The system imaged 30 electrically proven assemblies and
incorporated each pixel into a composite image of this mean-
intensity model for average operational boards.  Then design
data for a particular assembly was downloaded into the system
to create an overlay of components specific to the assembly
being tested.  The LED alignment positions, the template
images for each image time (10, 20, and 30 s) and CAD data
were used to create a test-control file specific to the circuit
assembly being tested.

To test boards from the factory, a baseline thermal reference
image was taken prior to automatic power-up and then the
boards were imaged in the factory-run mode.  The baseline
was subtracted from each image to eliminate random thermal
fluctuations.  The system compared the images taken at each
time to the template for that time, calculated any differences in
thermal intensity and determined statistical significance.  The
system "passed" the assembly if no excessively hot or cold
components were found.  In a "failed" unit, cold areas were
displayed blue and hot areas red.

According to Motorola, analysis shows that IRDAS detects
nonfunctional components by identifying the absence of
thermal output resulting from open circuits or excessive
outputs resulting from shorts, damage or misaligned parts. 
The company is currently trying to determine the limits of
detectability including out-of-specification resistances,
parametric shifts in output and other faults.

NO-CLEAN FLUX CREATES BOARD-PROBING PROBLEMS


Environmental agencies are prohibiting the use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) because it's commonly believed
that they affect the ozone layer.  Since traditional circuit board
assembly processes relied heavily on CFCs as solder flux
solvents, a replacement process was desperately needed.  One
alternative to cleaning PCBs with solvents is the use of no-
clean fluxes.  While no-clean solder flux solves the
environmental problem, it creates a new problem for test
fixturing, because it leaves a thick layer of residue on the unit
under test (UUT).  Although this "benign" residue will not
affect how the UUT operates, many test probes have trouble
penetrating it; also, nonconductive solids in the residue can act
as insulators and keep test probes from making a good
electrical contact.  There are various techniques  you can use
to alleviate this headache.

Standard test-fixture probes frequently cannot perform
adequately on a UUT coated with flux residue, so probe
manufacturers have developed new models that work in the
no-clean flux environment.  Single-needle probes can usually
penetrate the flux, and they are a popular choice for many
applications.  But the probe tips need to be replaced
frequently.  Even though the normal tip material--beryllium
copper--is a hard material, the tips still wear down prematurely
because of the high forces used to break through the flux.  An
alternate tip material is steel:  It is nearly twice as hard as
beryllium copper and, hence, lasts up to twice as long.  Single-
needle probes are ideal for solder-filled holes or pads, but if
you try using them for through-hole applications, you will get
slipping and side loading, which lead to inconsistent results
and bent tips.  For through-hole applications, you'll find tri-
needle, crown-shaped, or aggressive multifaceted tips to be
more appropriate.  Some probe manufacturers recommend
using rotating probes.  With these probes, the tip rotates
(usually 90 degrees) upon contact with the UUT, drilling
through contamination and making a good electrical
connection.  One obvious problem with this aggressive
solution is that it can damage the UUT; another problem is that
the debris produced by probe operation can clog the rotation
mechanism and disable it, so increased maintenance is
required.

In addition to selecting the optimum tip, you'll also need to
select the right probe spring pressure.  The normal range of
pressure, usually between 4 oz and 8 oz, may not be high
enough to penetrate the layer of residue.  You may need to
experiment with forces of 10 oz or greater.  Increased probe
pressure requires increased upward force on the UUT, which
may create vacuum leak problems.  Here are a few ways to
prevent leaks:

  1.  Use a high-capacity vacuum pump.  A minimum of 25 in.
of Hg and 40 CFM is suggested.  Use a dedicated vacuum
pump for each test area.

  2.  Vacuum volume can be just as important as vacuum
pressure.  Try to use a 10-15 gallon vacuum surge tank for
each test fixture.  This can improve test performance and
reliability by providing faster fixture actuation, which causes
both a better initial seal and a better electrical contact.

  3.  For maximum efficiency, avoid any plumbing restrictions. 
All pipes and hoses should be the largest practical size, and
valves and fittings should have the same inside dimensions as
the pipes, if possible.

Ideally, vacuum alone is all you need to actuate the fixture and
hold the UUT inplace.  If you use many high-force probes,
though, vacuum alone will not do the job, and the UUT may
become deformed or even become damaged because of
unbalanced forces.  To prevent such damage, you must use a
type of overclamp or hold-down gate.  The simplest solution
uses pressure fingers to hold the UUT firmly on the fixture and
to compensate for uneven test probe pressures.  Sometimes,
you'll need to isolate all or part of the UUT from the vacuum,
such as when there are open vias (multilayer feedthrough
connections) or large holes on the board.  Isolating open vias
and large holes minimizes contamination of the vacuum
system by flux residues, but it also exacerbates the uneven test
probe pressure problem, since the vacuum forces are not
present to counteract probe forces.  The probe plate could
deflect if the pressure is excessive; you may need to use a
thicker plate to reduce deflection.  Stress analysis can
determine which fixture components need strengthening. 
Loaded board lids, or vacuum boxes, are becoming more
common; these eliminate the vacuum isolation required when
using oveclamps but do not allow access to the UUT.  A
concentration of high-pressure probes without counterforce
from pressure fingers can distort the UUT, possibly causing
trace fractures or causing surface mount devices to pop off. 
Try to distribute probes evenly, but if you can't, allow space
on the top of the UUT above dense probe areas for pressure
fingers.  Work with the board designer to ensure that there is
space left for the pressure fingers.

The no-clean flux process generates much more residue than
conventional wave soldering, so new preventative
maintenance standards are needed to reduce downtime.  No
single maintenance schedule will work for all test fixtures.  If
you think your test conditions are not too severe, start by
cleaning or replacing probes every 25,000 cycles.  Fixtures
should be cleaned and seals and gaskets serviced every 20,000
cycles.  Be sure to inspect everything more frequently than
20,000 cycles, though, and adjust the replacement interval as
needed; some probes may need replacement after only 3000
cycles.  Try to minimize the impact of no-clean flux on testing
by fine-tuning the soldering process:  allow the board more
time to be heated; control solder paste application; raise the
temperature slightly during reflow; monitor the results; and
adjust all aspects of the process as required to minimize
residue on the test pads.  If possible, work with the designer to
ensure that:

  1.  Vias are not left open and the number and size of holes
are minimized; by attending to these details, you'll prevent
problems with vacuum leaks and eliminate the need for special
test probe tips;

  2.  Test points are evenly distributed over the UUT if
possible, especially on high-density boards;

  3.  The target pads for test probes are big enough to be
accessed repeatedly without special fixturing; and

  4.  There is adequate space for pressure fingers when they are
needed.

You should also work with the fabrication and inspection
groups so they know what types of errors to watch out for. 
You don't want to suddenly have a test point with no
continuity because of an undersized pad or an inaccurately
drilled hole.  Remember that the source of a testing problem is
often somewhere back up the production line.  With proper
design and fabrication, production problems can be
minimized.  There is no magic solution to test fixturing in a
no-clean flux environment.  The more you control a board's
design and manufacturing processes, the easier it will be to
design a fixture and perform a proper test; you'll uncover more
real failures and have fewer false failures due to fixturinig and
probing problems.  After years of fighting to get engineers to
design testable products, test engineers finally saw progress: 
designers began to design boards with enough space between
test points to allow easy and effective board probing.  Now,
the need to make circuits even smaller is causing test
engineers new problems.  But with proper planning, you can
ease the way you test assemblies that use a dense array of
small devices with fine-pitch leads.

Not only are designers shrinking the size of components, but
they are also increasing the number of pins on each
component.  As a result, lead pitches, or the distances between
leads, are becoming finer than ever.  The definition of "fine
pitch" depends on whom you ask.  Some engineers define
"fine pitch" as spacings of less than 0.040 in.  You can even
find some IC packages with lead pitches of only 0.010 in! 
When circuit leads are that close, it is difficult to build a robust
test fixture.  Nevertheless, there are several ways you can help
a product-development team improve the testability of
assemblies that incorporate fine-pitch components:

  1.  Encourage your designers to add boundary-scan
capabilities that will aid interconnect testing.  Boundary-scan
testing was developed to address the problem of circuit
density.  Testing the interconnects of an assembly with
boundary scan requires access to only four test points.  For
boundary scan to be effective, it must be designed into an IC. 
Look for off-the-shelf ICs that have boundary-scan capability,
and ask your designer to put boundary-scan circuits in custom
ICs.  Fortunately, most EDA vendors provide tools that let
designers insert boundary-scan circuits into custom designs. 
You also need a modern ATE that can drive boundary-scan
chains and evaluate test results.  ATE vendors supply test-
development tools that automate the test-program
development.

  2.  Make sure to set the design rules properly in your printed-
circuit board (PCB) layout program.  Most layout programs let
you set design rules and check for rule violations once the
design is complete.  Be sure the settings match the types of
testing you plan to do.

  3.  Add test points that you can probe.  In general, test points
should be in centers that are at least 0.020 in. apart, and the
farther apart you can place them, the better.  Adding test points
lets you better probe a printed-circuit board, but it also may
increase the size of the board or reduce the density of the
circuitry o the board. 

  4.  Pay special attention to fixture design and probe selection. 
Some newer probes let you probe test points on 0.010 in.
centers.  You must, however, handle these probes very
carefully, and you must design and build the fixture so the
probes can maintain their probe-pointing accuracy.  To
maintain the point accuracy, drill the probe's mounting holes
in a very accurate and straight manner.  Other factors that
contribute to pointing accuracy include straightness of the
plunger, clearance between the probe and the barrel, retained
length of the plunger, and extended length of the plunger.

  5.  Send assemblies directly from manufacturing to functional
test, shipping the manufacturing defect test stages.  The
disadvantage of using this approach is that you will have to
rely on your functional test to find manufacturing defects.  If
you select this approach, you should analyze failures carefully. 
When a manufacturing defect causes a failure, quickly send
the failure information back to the manufacturing engineers.

  6.  Use moving-probe testers to probe circuits that you can't
test with fixed-probe fixtures.  Moving-probe test systems are
often the solution of last resort, because they can be expensive,
and they don't test points as rapidly as a fixture with 100 test
points can.  Models are available that let you probe test points
as small as 0.002 in.  Manufacturers of moving probe testers
supply software that uses your printed-circuit board's layout
data to control the prober.

Even if your assemblies have not been designed for testability,
you still have test options.  You should, however, talk to your
designers and persuade them to add testability features to their
designs.  By adding the ability to adequately test products, the
engineers make it easier for you to set up tests and design test
fixtures.

SMTA TO REVISE TESTABILITY GUIDELINES


The Surface Mount Technology Association has undertaken
the revision of its popular publication TP-101A, Testability
Guidelines.  According to Tom Borkes, SMTA Vice President
of Technical Programs, the SMTA Board of Directors decided
that "our members would best be served by revising TP-101 to
bring it up to date" and "by providing a road map to help our
members establish a test strategy for their particular
applications."  The new Testability Guidelines will update and
expand the document's scope and reorganize the material into
a more user-friendly test handbook format.  The contents will
include sections on developing a general test strategy,
establishing a specific product test protocol (including a
discussion of ESS and burn-in), digital and analog testing,
boundary scan and capacitive characterization methods, and a
glossary.

BGA REWORK


OK Industries (Yonkers, NY) announced the all new BGA-
2000 series, BGA rework system.  Ed Zambrowski told us that
the BGA-200, which has a base price on the unit was $11,000,
is like having a small reflow oven at your fingertips.  The
system has been engineered to allow safe, efficient rework of
BGA components.  Utilizing a microprocessor profile
controller, the operator simply selects the appropriate removal
or replacement profile and starts the rework sequence. 
Removal and replacement profiles can be stored, recalled and
edited with the touch of a button, or to guarantee process
control, the profiles can be locked to eliminate operate
adjustment.  The BGA-2000's exclusive Micro Oven design
encapsulates the BGA being reworked ensuring that a constant
temperature controlled environment is maintained throughout
the reflow cycle.  The Micro Oven's proprietary PCB seal
combined with its elevated nozzle vents protect surrounding
components from adjacent heating damage normally
associated with non-focused convection heating devices.  The
BGA-2000's exclusive dual path heater module, bypasses the
heater chamber during cool-down ensuring a controlled, rapid
cool-down protecting solder ball integrity.

The closed loop temperature control feed back system
maintains the Micro Oven temperatures at +/-5o C, protecting
delicate components and ensuring accurate reflow process
control.  The BGA-200 offers 2 modes of operation:

  1.  Removal--with 5 pre-programmed removal heating
profiles; and
  2.  Placement--with 15 pre-programmed reflow profiles.

The BGA-2000 provides four temperature controlled zones in
each profile:

  1.  Subzone/Pre-heat;
  2.  Soak;
  3.  Peak; and
  4.  Cool-down.

Each of the profiles parameters (time/temperature) is digitally
displayed on the BGA-2000's front panel.  Operators can store
an additional 25 removal and 55 replacement profiles in the
BGA-2000's on-board profile storage locations.  An optional
RS-232 interface allows the operator to display, edit, monitor
and run profiles on the BGA-2000 directly from a PC.  An
additional thermocouple input is provided for remote
monitoring (i.e., under the component for profile set-up), and
is displayed on the BGA-2000 front panel or on the PC
through the RS-232 interface.  In addition to BGAs the BGA-
2000 can also rework QFPs, PLCCs and many other SMT
components, utilizing the full range of FCR SMT nozzles.

ASIAN MARKET STILL GOOD


The Asian market for SMT repair equipment has always been
different than the U.S. market.  Here boards, destined for
military or aerospace applications, for example, were
expensive and repair a necessity.  Asian manufacturers were
interested in boards destined for consumer electronics.  They
worked very hard to get their lines running as efficiently as
possible and when mistakes were made, the boards were
simply discarded.  The Asian market was, traditionally,
dominated by the Japanese.  When the Japanese market
slowed down, the market for SMT equipment generally
slowed down too, except that at about the same time the
Japanese market was slowing down, the Korean market, in
particular, was heating up.

In terms of the attitude of Asian manufacturers toward SMT
repair equipment, we found in talking to SMT repair
equipment manufacturers that the nature of the market was
still about the same.  These are still high volume
manufacturers and they spend less time repair boards than U.S.
manufacturers do, except that with an increase in the use of
some advanced packages, such as multichip modules and
BGAs, there is a slight improvement in the amount of repair
work being done.  The more significant change in the market
is, though, geographical.  Whereas the Japanese market
dominated the area tremendously five years ago, now the
Korean market, particularly, is very good, along with the
market in Taiwan and Singapore.

Additionally, with the growth of Asian markets outside Japan,
there has been a great deal of prototyping work which has
drawn in a lot of rework equipment from the United States. 
Altogether U.S. manufacturers were finding the Asian market
as good as it ever was or much better.  One company saw their
equipment being bought in part as a means to help
manufacturers improve their processing lines rather than just
to repair boards.  When problems began occurring, boards
could be examined with the rework station and the cause of the
problem determined.  Sales in Asia often came through Asian
reps although some sales to Asia originated in the United
States with U.S. companies that have manufacturing facilities
in Asia, particularly in Singapore.

While the trend toward automation was evident to most
manufacturers, there was the feeling that much of the market
was still interested in semiautomatic and manual equipment. 
Machines designed for BGA work were the ones that got the
company's name in the trade journals, but customers were
mostly interested in equipment that allowed them to quickly
remove and replace SOICs and other less glamorous
components.  But the market for BGA repair equipment is
definitely here and growing.  Sales are coming from larger
manufacturers right now, since these are the companies using
BGA packages the most.  As much as 20% of the larger
manufacturers are probably buying BGAs and repair
equipment for PCBs with BGAs.  By the end of the years,
however, the market for BGA repair equipment, it's felt, will
have spread to larger contract manufacturers.

Chipmaster Simplifies BGA Rework 

The Chipmaster from A.P.E.  (Key Largo, FL) is another system designed for BGA
rework.  Jim Dornan told us the unit was developed for work at Motorola and
was sold as part of Metcal's line.  The unit sells for $3,800 and provides a
single station BGA and SMT repair solution.  The Chipmaster organizes the
rework environment while addressing the problems of BGA and SMT component
repair, by providing better process control and less maintenance.  With the
Chipmaster, the replacement consumables are limited to a simple vacuum cup.
The Chipmaster X-Y table dictates and creates the reflow and placement
topography and becomes the "engine" which drives the bench allowing an
ergonomic arrangement of bench management.  With the Chipmaster being the only
true BGA machine designed for Motorola at an equipped price of $3,800, it
represents a sensible cost effective answer to tomorrow's components today.

METCAL OFFERS TO CUSTOMIZE TIPS 


The Metcal (Menlo Park, CA) Custom Talon Tip Program ensures that Talon
users can get custom tips in a fraction of the time of a normal custom tip
program or production release.  The program fills in the gap for the majority
of end-users with customized tip requirements between readily-available
standard tips and those with highly specialized configurations.  There is no
minimum order for custom tips; however, it order to achieve time and cost
goals, certain limitations have been placed on the program in terms of
guidelines.  For example, tips must meet certain dimensional requirements,
must be for 2-sided component removal only, and be in the 500 and 600 series
temperature ranges.  Other requirements and restrictions apply.  Custom tips
which fall outside the shape, temperature range, or other guidelines can be
accommodate, but not as part of the program.
