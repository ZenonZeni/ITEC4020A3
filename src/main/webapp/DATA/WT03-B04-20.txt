BANGLADESH
POLITICS

Prime Minister Zia finally succumbed to the pressure of the
opposition parties and handed in her government's resignation on
November 24.  The battle with the opposition parties - Awami League,
Jatiya and Jamaat-e-Islami - began in December 1994 when, led by the
Awami League, they refused to participate in a by-election, accusing
the government of blatant corruption, of winning the 1991 general
election by fraud and of perpetrating the same practice in an earlier
by-election in which the ruling Bangladesh National Party (BNP) was
victorious in a known Awami League stronghold.  All 142 opposition
members then withdrew from parliament and started a campaign of
"rolling" strikes or hartal in order to force the government's
resignation, the installation of a neutral caretaker government, and
the calling of a fresh general election.

But Prime Minister Zia has not gone down without fighting.  Despite
the economic disruption, and violence, of the hartals, she has kept
her government in office with only her own 138 BNP party members
sitting in parliament.  As a result, although she has finally been
forced to call an early general election, she has still managed to
serve out almost all of her term of office which was due to end in
March of this year anyway.  Moreover, although President Biswas
accepted her government's resignation he has not given way to
opposition demands for a caretaker prime minister.  Instead he has
asked Ms. Zia to stay on as caretaker through to the new election.

The end game in the struggle between government and opposition began
in late September when the hartal program was stepped up with a call
for a 48-hour strike on October 7 in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong,
Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, to be followed by a four-day
nationwide shutdown from October 16.  There was the usual violence.
At least one person was killed and more than 40 injured in the
general strike.

In an attempt to regain the initiative, Prime Minister Zia carried
out a minor reshuffle of her cabinet on October 18.  She then
announced by-elections for all 145 vacant opposition seats in
parliament to be held on December 15 and invited the opposition
parties to demonstrate their commitment to democracy by contesting
for their own seats.

The opposition response was to call for a countrywide blockade of
road, rail and water transport on November 6 to be followed by a
12-hour general strike across the country on six consecutive days
from November 11.

The transportation blockade brought the country to a virtual
standstill and at least 200 people, police and demonstrators, were
injured in numerous clashes in which the police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets.  The security situation deteriorated further when the
general strike began on November 11.  As far as is known there were
no fatalities.  However a number of grenades and home made bombs were
thrown and at least 50 people were injured, including the leader of
the Awami League, Motia Chowdhury and his wife.

Presumably recognizing that any attempt to hold by-elections for the
opposition seats would almost certainly even more widespread
violence, with the danger that security could break down completely,
Prime Minister Zia handed in her resignation saying she looked
forward to free and fair elections in which the opposition parties
would play a full part.

She argued that the whole electoral process had been cleaned up under
her administration.  The election laws have been extensively amended
and the electoral Commission strengthened to prevent any government
or other force from illegally influencing the election process.  In
addition, she said, her government had made provision to set up a
committee of judges for immediate arbitration if a party, individual,
or candidate is accused of violating the election law or rules.  New
electoral lists has been formulated to check rigging and identity
cards are to be used to verify the registration of voters.

The prime minister also stressed the difference between the
constitutional governance of the country at the last general election
and this.  In 1990, Bangladesh had an executive presidency under
which an unelected person could be appointed vice-president.  Under
such circumstances it was within the realms of possibility for a
person with no popular mandate to become the executive head of state.
Now, as a result of the 12th amendment to the constitution approved
by parliament and referendum in 1991, the executive presidency had
been replaced by a parliamentary system in which the prime minister
was head of government and only an elected member of parliament could
occupy the post of prime minister.

The fundamental difference between her and the opposition parties,
she claimed, was that she supported the current system of governance,
while they wanted to return to the executive presidency system, an
impossibility under the current constitution.

The response of the opposition parties to all this is not yet known.
Neither is the election date.  Both are critical.  The opposition
parties will clearly be cheered by the fact that the prime minister
has finally caved in, but will still be anxious that she remains head
of government and, in their view, still able to exercise a malign
role in the election process.  With that in mind they will be looking
for the election to be held sooner rather than later.  Prime Minister
Zia on the other hand will probably want to delay as long as
possible.

At the moment the outcome is impossible to predict, but we would not
be surprised if President Zip's BNP still emerged as the largest
party in the new parliament.

Expulsions
Dhaka has responded angrily to Pakistan's November expulsion of
Bangla speakers to Bangladesh, rejecting Islamabad's claim that they
are Bangladeshi nationals.  The Pakistani move hits at the heart of a
long-running sore in Bangladeshi-Pakistani relations - the status of
the Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh.

Under an agreement made in 1974, Pakistan undertook to accept as
Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims who were still resident
in the former East Pakistan and who did not accept the newly
established Bangladesh as their country.  Under the agreement
Pakistan did allow an initial  150,000 Biharis, who had blood
relations in Pakistan, to immigrate.  However, no Bihari Muslims have
been allowed into Pakistan since 1974, leaving some 250,000 stranded
in Bangladesh.

During an official visit to Pakistan in April last year, Prime
Minister Zia reminded her hosts of the 1974 commitment.  In addition,
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds
for the rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis, asked Pakistan to let
the stranded Biharis come back.  This was probably the background to
the arrival of some 700 Bangladeshi immigrants in Pakistan in
October.

However, these people were immediately ejected.  Then, on October 31,
Pakistani interior minister, Nasirullah Babar, told the National
Assembly that the government intended to "throw out" all illegal
immigrants.  As for the OIC's appeal to take back the stranded
Biharis, he said "Let the Arabs take the Biharis" as there is plenty
of land to settle them in the UAE, Iraq or elsewhere in West Asia.

The reasons for Pakistan's reluctance to accept any more Bihari
Muslims and its ejection of those already resident in the country
probably have far more to do with the troubles in Karachi and Sind
province generally than with fears of overpopulation.  A large number
of the Bangla-speaking Pakistanis are sympathetic to the Mohajir
Qaumi Movement (MQM) in urban Sind.  Getting rid of them reduces the
size of the MQM's support base.

BANGLADESH
ECONOMY

Although Prime Minister Zia has done her best to pump up an economic
success story, an election could hardly have come at a less
propitious time in economic terms.  While, the free-market policy she
launched four years ago did have some striking early successes, it
has run out of steam of late, forcing a reversal of many of the
original policy initiatives.

Thus, while the prime minister boasted in October last that the GDP
per head had risen from US$170 in 1991 to some US$236 in the current
financial year, she omitted to mention that his had been undermined
by a huge jump in the inflation rate from 1.8% in 1993/94 to over 6%
currently.  Moreover, the blanket inflation figure masks even greater
rises in prices of essential commodities, which hit harder on the
poor, and the poor make up the greater part of the population.

One major cause of the sharp rise in inflation has been an enormous
jump in the money supply as a direct result of the free market
policy, or, rather, its inadequate management.

When the free market program was instituted, interest rates were cut,
the system of Letter of Credit margins for imports was withdrawn, and
the maximum ceiling on project loans was abolished.  The overall aim
of these measures was to encourage investment, by making borrowing
cheaper, which would in turn create new large employment
opportunities.  The overall effect would be to bring a new dynamism
into the economy.

Between June 1991 and April 1994, the bank rate was reduced nine
times, from 9.75% to 5.5%.  Over the same period the interest rate on
savings accounts, which ranged between 8% and 11.5%, was reduced to
4.5%.  The interest rate on fixed deposits, which ranged between 10%
and 13.75%, was reduced to 5%.

The package was well received by the international community.  The
mobilization of domestic resources was increased, the foreign
exchange rate stabilized, foreign exchange reserves increased, the
deficit in foreign transactions reduced, and domestic savings
increased.  Against this background the annual GDP growth averaged
4.4% between 1991/92 and 1993/94 while the inflation rate was brought
down from 9% to under 2%.

But now things have started to go wrong.  The government was right
that lower interest rates would encourage borrowing.  The problem is
it had no means of exercising control over how the borrowed money was
to be used.  Over the four years of the economic plan BT145 billion
has been withdrawn from the country's banks and financial
institutions in the form of loans.  In 1994/95 alone these loans
amounted to BT85 billion.

However, neither the government nor the central bank has any reliable
means of measuring where this money has gone.  For example, imports
have risen from Bt135 billion in 1991/92 to Bt270 billion in 1994/95,
but the central bank has virtually no information on the pattern of
this growth.  It does not know which sectors of the economy are
responsible for the increase or why. The effects, however, are clear
- foreign exchange reserves fell by US$900 million in the first four
months of the current financial year.

What is known is that the growth in the money supply - up from 10% to
18% over the four year period - has outstripped the increase in the
volume of trade and investment.  The obvious conclusion is that the
money taken in loans from the banks has been spent on consumption
goods rather than invested in the productive sectors of the economy.

Now, in order to cut back on the money supply and rein in inflation,
almost all the free-market reforms have been reversed.  The currency
has been devalued twice, the interbank rate raised three times from
4.5% to 6.5% with consequent rises in the interest rates on savings
accounts and fixed deposits in banks, a 25% margin rate for Letters
of Credit has been reimposed, and a maximum loan limit of Bt250
million has been imposed on all large industrial projects.

The problem for the central bank is that a strategy of using interest
rates alone to solve the crisis may not be enough.  Up to 40% of the
bank loans already made must be regarded as non-performing or lost.
On top of that the upcoming general election will inevitably mean an
increase in spending, further boosting the money supply and inflation
rate.

INDIA
POLITICS

At a federal level, the political classes are now entirely consumed
with the upcoming general election to the lower house of parliament,
the Lok Sabha, with the Bharaiya Janata Party (BJP), in particular
confident that it can make major inroads into Congress Party support.
The BJP formally re-elected L.K. Advani as its leader for a second
successive term on October 21 last.  Advani was unopposed.

The term of the present parliament expires on July 8, which makes
June the last possible month for the election.  At the time of
writing no election date has been fixed, but it appears that most the
opposition parties - the BJP, communist Party of India (CPI),
communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), Janata Dal and the Samata
Party - favor a date in February, immediately after the fasting month
of Ramadan, with elections for some assemblies to be completed by
March 10.  However, with its prospects uncertain, Congress (I) wants
to hold out as long as possible.  With that in mind, an election
sometime in the second half of April looks the most likely outcome.

Although the parties differ on the date of the election, there is an
apparent consensus for a single-day poll in states and for polls for
the federal parliament to be held over a maximum of three days.

Jammu and Kashmir
The government's elections plans have been thrown into dome disarray
by the decision of the Electoral commission on November 10 not to go
ahead with elections in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir.

President's rule in the state was due to expire on January 17.  It
was a principal part of the government's overall strategy to have
elections held in the state and a new state government installed well
before then.  It was a multi-target strategy.  First, the holding of
the elections would have demonstrated, both at home and abroad, that
the central government was sufficiently on top of the security
situation to conduct the elections.  Second, it would have undermined
growing international pressure on India by providing a democratically
elected state government that was not committed to full independence
or absorption by Pakistan.  Third, it would have provided a
tremendous boost to the government's authority just ahead of the
federal elections.

Despite the continuing widespread violence and terrorism in the
state, hopes that an election would be held were raised on October 25
when the National Conference party (NC), which formed the state
government until President's rule was imposed on January 19, 1990,
held its first public meeting for six years.  Over 2,000 people
turned up for the meeting which was held in the apple township of
Sopore, until recently a militant stronghold.

Prime Minister Rao immediately initiated talks with the NC leader and
former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, with
the aim of securing his agreement to the government's election and
devolution plans.  However, the talks broke down on November 2, with
Farooq sticking to his demand for a return to pre-1953 status for the
state.  This conferred residuary sovereignty on Jammu and Kashmir in
respect of all matters except defense, foreign affairs and
communications.  Rao's devolution package, on the other hand,
specifies that the status of the state should be worked out after the
election in consultation with the election state parliament.

After the talks deadlock, Dr. Farooq said the NC would boycott the
"the election farce", With that he put himself in line with virtually
every other political party in India, both inside and outside Jammu
and Kashmir, except Congress (I).  Despite this near unanimous
opposition and a frightening security situation, Prime Minister Rao
was determined to press ahead and announced that elections would be
held in the state in mid-December.

He appeared not to have reckoned on the three-man Electoral
Commission, however.  After visiting the state, the Commission
unanimously declared that "the sum total of factors in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir are not consistent with the conduct of a fair and
free election".  Rao had gambled, and lost.

This leaves the government with precious little room for maneuver in
the state.  The daily murder toll is at alarming proportions in the
border areas; Pakistan has succeeded in internationalizing the issue
with India coming under increasing foreign criticism for its handling
of the situation and its alleged abuses of human rights; and, last
but not least, there is now increasingly hard evidence of direct
Pakistani involvement in the fighting.  This is exactly the mix that
brought Pakistan and India to war in 1965 and 1971.

In the meantime, the government has embarked on the massive task of
building a barbed wire security fence along its entire border with
Pakistan.  The fence has already been completed in the Punjab and the
fencing of the 1,035 kilometer border between Rajasthan state and
Pakistan  is planned to be completed by March 1996.  Fencing of the
190-kilometer Kashmir border will then be undertaken.  According to
the government, the border fence in the Punjab has already been
effective in deterring infiltrators.

Despite the precarious security situation in the state, the federal
government claims that the agricultural and allied sectors in Jammu
and Kashmir have recorded strong growth over the past six years.
According to official figures, foodgrain production rose to 1.95
million tonnes during 1994 from 1.45 million tonnes in 1991/92.  Over
the same period, rice production in the state increased from 550,000
tonnes in 1991/92 to 807,000 tonnes; and fertilizer production from
68,000 tonnes to 73,000 tonnes.   Fruit production also rose during
the period.  Apple production has risen from 79,200 tonnes to 1,900
tonnes, while the area under apple orchards has expanded from 46,000
hectares  in 1974/75 to 83,000 hectares in 1993/94.  The per hectare
yield of applies, the main fruit grown in the Kashmir Valley, has
risen from 1.12 tonnes in 1974-75 to 10.04 tonnes in 1993-94.

In addition, the state is to have its first-ever industrial growth
center, to be located in Ompura.  Also, the Small Scale Industries
Institute relocated from Srinagar to Jammu due to militancy is to be
moved back to Srinagar.

Civil Disorder
Civil disorder, frequently descending to the level of political
terrorism, continue to make parts of India, particularly in the
north, extremely dangerous places in which to live.  On October 31, a
mass demonstration by Sikhs in the capital, New Delhi, resulted in
some 200 arrests.  The demonstration was called to protest against
the federal government's apparent inaction in punishing anyone of
significance for inciting the riots against Sikhs in 1984, following
the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh guard.

In particular, the demonstrators demanded the arrest of the Congress
(I) member of parliament from Outer Delhi, Sajjan Kumar, and former
federal minister H.K.L. Bhagat, for their alleged roles in the riots.
On November 10, a bomb blast in the capital injured an estimated 19
people.

On November 13, Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East-West
Airlines, India's first private carrier, was shot dead by
unidentified persons in Bombay.   on November 13.  Wahid was shot
outside his office and was dead on arrival at hospital.  He started
the airline in 1992.

As for violence elsewhere in the country:

Manipur
In November, suspected activists of the underground People's
Liberation Army (PLA) shot dead a the district manage of the
government's Food Corporation of India in the state capital, Imphal.
After his death, police found a threatening letter in his office from
the Revolutionary People's Front, the political wing of the PLA for
not paying Ir500,000 to the group.

Tripura
Insurgents, believed to belong to the National Liberation Front of
Tripura (NLFT) killed six people in separate incidents in the first
two days of October.  On October 3, four policemen were killed in an
ambush.  On October 4, five people, including three members of the
ruling CPI-M were killed in separate incidents and at the end of the
month there were three more murders in separate incidents.

However, in November, the government claimed that "all 157 rebels of
an another, unnamed, "military movement" surrendered to the
authorities in after an appeal from the state government.  The
rebels, led by a Captain Murari Mohant Saha, turned in their weapons
and ammunition.

Gujarat
There were violent demonstrations in Gujarat in early October
following a split in the BJP when Shankar Sinh Vaghela, the leader of
a dissident BJP faction allied himself and 48 of his supporters with
Madhya Pradesh.  More than 5,000 BJP activists, reportedly led by BJP
parliament member A.K. Patel and state Health Minister Nalin Patel,
attacked the building where the dissidents were staying, kidnapping
one of them.

Assam
Bodo tribal militants, operating under the banners of the Bodo
Security Force (BSF) and the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)
killed at least 22 people - security personnel and civilians -  in
October and November in sporadic attacks.

Uttar Pradesh.
Governance in the state was thrown into chaos in October, just ahead
of municipal elections scheduled for November, when the BJP withdrew
its support for the four-and-a-half month old Bahujan Samaj Party
government.  The BJP move appeared to have been prompted by the
murder of its leader in the state, Babu Ram Gupta, by unknown
assailants in Muzaffarnagar on October 8.

The withdrawal of the BJP forced the resignation of the state's chief
minister, Ms Mayawati, on October 18.  With no party in the state
able to command a majority, president's rule was imposed on October
18.

As usual, violence ensued.  On October 24, about 34 people suffered
minor injures when a bomb exploded at a market near Allahabad, and in
November two people, including a police officer, were killed in an
explosion in Jhansi.

However, the municipal elections went ahead as planned, with the BJP
emerging as the clear winner.  Also in November, the federal
government confirmed that it is willing to grant autonomous region
status to Uttarakhand.  There were violent incidents in the Garhwal
mountain region in early October during a strike to press demands for
Uttarakhand to be granted separate statehood.

Anti-foreigner Sentiment
So far there have been no reported attacks on foreigners, outside of
Jammu and Kashmir, but there is a rising tide of resentment against
"Westerners" among militant Hindu groups.  In late October, the New
Delhi unit of the militant Hindu Shiv Sena group has threatened
"direct action" against the recently opened Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet in the city if it does not leave the country immediately.  The
organization alleges that the multinational food chain is hurting the
religious sentiments of the Hindu people by indulging in the sale of
beef products.

This was followed up at the beginning of November by a conference,
organized by the Karnataka state farmers' association, which called
for multinational companies to be "driven out" of India.  Criticizing
the government's "globalizaton" policy, the conference speakers
claimed the multinationals were "exploiters" who would displace the
local people and aggravate the unemployment problem.  There was also
a call for a national movement to pursue the fight against them.

Against that background, the November decision by the state
government in Maharashtra to renegotiate the US$2.8 billion Dabhol
power project contract with Enron produced an enormous sigh of relief
from both the federal government and foreign investor community
alike.

State Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena-BJP government
unilaterally canceled the agreement with Enron Development
Corporation (EDC) in August last, after they succeeded the Congress
(I) government that negotiated the deal.

The decision dented confidence in federal government's ability to
pursue its energy sector development program, in which foreign
investment was supposed to play a major role, particularly as
neighboring Rajasthan then canceled its talks with Enron over a major
solar power project.  Enron's response to the Maharashtra decision
was to seek redress in law by opening arbitration proceedings against
the state to achieve either a declaration from the government that it
would meet its contractual obligations or pay damages to the project
partners.

JANUARY 1996

INDIA
ECONOMY

India's GDP grew by an estimated 6.2% in the financial year 1994/95,
to an estimated IR2,474.89 billion, against a growth of 5.3% to
IR2,453.06 billion in 1993/94.

The latest forecast for the Industry Ministry puts industrial sector
growth in the 1995/96 year at over 10%.  Industrial growth recovered
to 6% in 1993/94 and rose to 8.2% in 1994/95.  This year's impetus is
coming principally from strong export growth.  Currently the
industrial sector is contributing around 75% to total exports, which,
in turn, are growing at an estimated 20%.

In its 'World Economic Output' report, released on October 4, the IMF
said that recovery in India was now well established with increased
supply responses from structural reforms.  The report said that by
tightening monetary policy early this year inflation had been brought
down to single-digit levels.  It also remarked favorably on the
supply response to structural reforms and capital growth.

It forecast that the GDP could rise by 5.5% this year, with exports
continuing to grow at double-digit rates and private investment
remaining robust.  However, the IMF also advised that stronger action
be taken to reduce the fiscal deficit further and that structural
reforms be speeded up to reduce the risk of a renewed rise in
inflationary pressures.  So far, the fiscal deficit has been reduced
from 8.8% of GDP in 1992/93 to a projected 5.6% in the current year.

Privatization
The federal government accepted 167 bids for shares in four top
public sector undertakings (PSUs) - Container Corporation of India,
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL),
and the oil giant ONGC at the beginning of November.  The companies
form the first round of disinvestment of PSU shares in the current
financial year.

All valid bids which had quoted at prices equal to or above the
reserve price for each PSU were considered and the offers were
accepted in descending order of the price offered.

Inward Investment
USA
The USA is the largest foreign investor in India.  US investment
proposals increased from US$0.35 billion during the years 1975 to
1991 to US$1.7 billion during the two subsequent years and the first
quarter of 1994.

The bulk of the investment proposals were approved during 1993 and
the first half of 1994.  During this period, investment proposals
worth US$1.3 billion were approved.  In 1991-93, 804 collaborations
with the USA were approved.  However, the pace of investment appears
to be slowing.  In the first half of the current financial year, US
investments touched US$1 billion, compared with US$1.2 billion in the
same period of the 1994/95 year.  Bilateral trade this year is
expected to exceed US$8 billion.

According to a report by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce last
year, US companies intending to invest in India in the current year
include ICMC Power Consortium Inc. a joint venture comprising
Westinghouse Electric Corp. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. and Sergeant
and Lundi.  The consortium plans to set up a power project and a
harbor complex at Cuddalore to facilitate coal imports for the power
sector.

Areas identified for potential Indo-US collaboration are
telecommunications, power, biotechnology, chemicals and allied
products, computer hardware and software, electrical and electronics
equipment, food processing, food products for children, health care
products, hybrid seeds, information technology, natural food products
with low cholesterol, petrochemicals, power generation,
semi-conductors and transport equipment.

The USA also has the highest number of technical collaborations in
India.  From the period July 1991 to July 1993, the USA accounted for
352 technical collaborations out of the total of 1719, i.e. 20% of
the total.

Meanwhile the government has said it is actively considering opening
up the insurance sector to foreign investors.  A regulatory authority
has already been set up to oversee the operations of insurance
companies and the decision on when to open the insurance sector is
expected to be finalized soon.

Legislation was passed last year to allow 49% private equity capital
in public sector banks, with the government retaining the controlling
51%.  Several public sector banks, including the State Bank of India,
have floated shares to raise capital from the public market.

Japan
Last November Japan announced its intention to participate in a
venture capital fund, the South Asia Regional Apex fund (SARA), to
help nurture local small businesses in India.  Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) will join forces in the fund with
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an arm of the World
Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  Both OECF and the IFC
will each put N7.5 billion into the fund, while the ADB's
contribution will be N4.5 billion.

The SARA fund expects to invest an average N20 million in small
business projects through 10 state-level funds to create 100,000 jobs
over a 15-year period.  The money will go mainly to venture companies
planning stock listing.  The fund will recover its investment by
selling stock in the firms when they go public.

India and Japan have also agreed to set up a mechanism to resolve
outstanding bilateral trade issues.  It is hoped this will lead to an
acceleration in Japanese investment in India.

Non-Resident Indian Investments
Over the past four years, NRIs have made direct investment of around
US$1 billion.  In the first five months of 1995/96, NRIs have placed
about US$232million worth of foreign direct investment in India,
three times the amount during the whole of 1992/93.

So far, approvals for NRI direct investments total US$4 billion, 30%
of total foreign direct investment approvals of US$13.6 billion.
Total NRI deposits so far are in the region of US$17.5 billion and
have been coming in at the rate of US$1.7billion a year since
1992/93.  To date US$4.4 billion are invested in India under the NRI
scheme launched in 1970 and US$6.3 billion under the FCNR (A) scheme
of 1975, which will terminate by August 1997.  The new FCNR (B)
scheme has attracted US$4.04 billion and the non-resident
non-repatriable (NRNR) scheme has brought in US$2.7 billion.

In order to boost NRI investment in the services sector, the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI - the central bank) has granted general permission
to NRIs to subscribe to company memoranda and articles of association
and to take up shares of Indian companies up to the amount of
Ir10,000 with effect from November 1, last year.  The permission
applies if the proposed venture pertains to any activity except
agriculture and plantations.  Previously, this general permission was
available only for NRI investments in industrial activities.

Tourism
Tourism currently ranks third - after the gems, jewelry and
ready-made garments sectors - in terms of foreign exchange earnings.
A total of 1.91million foreign tourists visited India in 1994/95, a
growth of 2.14% over 1993-94.  Foreign exchange earnings from tourism
in the whole country grew by 13.16% from Ir65.09 billion in 1993/94
to Ir73.6561 billion in 1994/95.

As a result, the India Tourism Development Corp. (ITDC) has surpassed
all previous achievements with an 80% increase in profits before tax,
grossing Ir430.17 million during 1994/95.  ITDC earned Ir280.37
million after tax, an increase of 132% on the figure for the previous
year.  The company has declared a dividend of Ir50.67 million for
1994/95 - the highest dividend it has ever paid.  Turnover increased
by 25% from 1993/94 to Ir2.36 billion.

The Corporation attributes the bulk of the improvement to its hotels
division - the Ashok Group - which had an increased turnover of
Ir11.45 billion and net profits of Ir220.71 million.

The violence in the Kashmir Valley has had an effect, costing the
sector an estimated 25% of its revenue.  However, the government is
hoping that this will be compensated for by a rise in tourism in the
other northern states.  Despite continuing sporadic violence in
Assam, Tripura and Mehalaya, the government has withdrawn the
Restricted Area designation from them.

INDIA
FINANCE

Despite the uplift in exports, India's trade deficit jumped to
US$1.976 billion in the April-August period last year, from a deficit
of US$798.53 million in the same period of 1994. Imports in August
are estimated at US$2.924 billion, compared with US$2.24 billion in
August 1994.  The import growth during the month was 30.53%.  The
increase in petroleum, oil and lubricant (POL) imports was 2.54%.
Non-oil import growth was 38.99% in the month.

Exports in the April-August period are estimated at US$12.302 billion
compared with US$9.613 in April-August 1994 - a growth of 27.97%.
The level of exports in August 1995, at US$2.452 billion, is the
highest is the highest monthly figure so far in the current financial
year.  It is also 20% higher than exports of US$2.106 billion in
August 1994.  Imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at
US$14.278 billion as against US$10.411 billion in the corresponding
period of 1994.

POL imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at US$2.762
billion compared with US$2.263 billion during April-August 1994.  POL
imports increased by 17% during this period.

Reserves
The nation's foreign exchange reserves, excluding gold and special
drawing rights (SDRs), fell sharply for the second month in a row at
the end of October last by US$3.052 billion to US$17.757 billion.
The foreign exchange reserves stood at US$20.809 billion at the end
of the 1994/95 financial year.

The slow accretion in foreign exchange or the down slide in reserves
is mainly accounted for by increased imports under the liberalized
regime, according to the Finance Ministry.

Meanwhile, Russia agreed to settle about 900 Indian claims amounting
to Ir800 million, during a meeting between the two sides in Moscow at
the end of October.  The claims relate to export contracts,
non-exports, including personal savings with Soviet banks, pensions,
fees and third country contracts.  They have been pending since
December 1992 when the former Soviet Union collapsed.

Exchange Rate
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was forced to intervene again on
October 26 to halt the slide of the rupee against the US dollar.  The
dollar opened at Ir35.50 and gradually went up to a high of Ir35 on
the interbank foreign exchange market.

At this stage, the RBI intervened by selling dollar at a rate lower
than the prevailing market price.  After the intervention, the rupee
firmed up and closed at Ir35.50/US$.

Banking sources attributed the fall in the rupee value to short-term
economic conditions arising out of a rise in imports and government's
debt payments.  As a result of demand-supply gap, market forces are
pushing the dollar upwards.

PAKISTAN
POLITICS

Prime Minister Bhutto's policy of encouraging members of the former
international Islamic fundamentalist Mujaheddin that fought the
Russians in Afghanistan to use Pakistan as a base to wage an intifada
(her expression) against India's "occupation" of Kashmir, is possible
coming back to haunt her.

Not only is the violence in Karachi - almost certainly fueled by arms
and expertise gathered in the Afghan conflict - continuing unabated,
but the government's near "open-door" policy to militant
fundamentalists from the Islamic world undoubtedly contributed to the
ease with which Arab terrorists were able to mount their devastating
attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad on November 19.

The embassy was wrecked by two explosions, which killed a total of 18
people and injured 60.  Three Egyptian militant groups in Cairo
claimed responsibility for the attack and the evidence so far is that
it was carried out mainly, if not completely by foreign nationals.
Talk in Islamabad is of a team of eight, mostly Egyptians, belonging
to an extremist Islamic organization, Takfir wal-Hirjah.  However,
there has been talk of Sudanese, Jordanians and Afghans being
involved as well.

The group is believed to have entered Pakistan via Afghanistan and
may have had internal logistical support inside Pakistan from either
the immigrant Arab community in Peshawar or from the International
Islamic University in Islamabad.  After the bombing Interior Minister
Nasirullah Khan Babar said that the University had become a "hideout
of terrorists".  President Leghari, however, dismissed the statement
saying there was no evidence of University people taking part in the
bombing.

Expulsions
The government did come to a belated recognition of the dangers of
giving house-room to so many potential fanatics just before the
embassy bombing, with Babar announcing a crackdown on illegal
immigrants in October.  However, the move was weighted entirely on
those immigrants who might add to the security collapse in Karachi
and Sind province generally. Those groups who support or engage in
the struggle against Indian forces in Kashmir remained untouched as
did the religious seminaries, packed with Arab students, that
fulminate against the West and preach a doctrine of Islam
unadulterated by 1,500 years of history.

It was only after the bombing that the government ordered the
expulsion of all Arabs without legal documents.

The 600-700 immigrants expelled by the government in October were all
Bangladeshis.  Interior Minister Babar said they had been expelled
because they had fake documents.

The more probable reason is that the government believes that the
majority of them are at best sympathetic to, and at worst actual
supporters of, the ethnic Indian Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) that is
wrecking such havoc in urban Sind.  According to the government there
are some two million illegal immigrants in Karachi.

The move is also a slap in the a face to Bangladesh over the
contentious issue of the Bihari Muslims.  In 1974, Pakistan agreed to
accept as Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh
who did not accept the new country as theirs.

Between then and 1992, Pakistan did admit around 150,000 Biharis, who
had blood relations in Pakistan, into the country.  However, it has
not officially admitted any more since then, leaving some 250,000
Biharis stranded in Bangladesh..

During her state visit to Pakistan earlier last year, Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia Rahman asked her hosts to make good on
their 1974 commitment.  In this she was backed up by the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds for the
rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis.

The Prime Minister and the OIC got there reply in October when
Interior Minister Babar said that if they were so concerned the Arab
countries should take the Biharis as there was plenty of room for
them in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and elsewhere in West Asia.

Military in Politics
The role of the military in the governance of the country has come to
the fore again with the announcement that the government had foiled
an alleged coup attempt by a group of military officers.

The significance of the coup bid, which was reportedly discovered in
September and announced in November, was to be carried out by a group
calling itself Amirul Momineen (leaders of the faithful).  It was led
by Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, a former defense attachi in
the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi where he was expelled as a
spy, and Brigadier Mustansar Billa.  They led a group of officers,
including three colonels, and civilians, reportedly numbering around
30 in all.  The group is also believed to have links with ex-generals
and right-wing politicians.

It has been claimed that the plotters were caught by chance at a
meeting on September 28 when they were putting the finishing touches
to their plans to "eliminate all senior commanders of the Pakistan
Army, before taking over key government installations.

The army and government have attempted to play down the seriousness
of the coup attempt.  However, it is significant, not only in that it
was apparently thwarted purely by chance, but also in that it
highlights a growing dissatisfaction in the military with Prime
Minister Bhutto's government (many senior officers much prefer her
predecessor Nawaz Sharif).  It also indicates a division in the
senior ranks of the military between those who are prepared to put up
with an elected civilian government so long as they and theirs are
taken care of, and those who want the army to return to its near
traditional role as direct political master.

The message for Prime Minister Bhutto seems fairly clear.  If she
wants to keep the premiership, and possibly her head, she will have
to pander to the military to an even greater extent than she has
already.  That could mean even greater direct involvement in Kashmir,
with all the dangers of an all-out war with India that such an
escalation would bring.

Political Terrorism
With talks between the government and the MQM still stalled, the
situation in the city remains as murderous as ever with tit-for-tat
killings by MQM-Altaf group activists and the security forces taking
place on a daily basis.

The more notable atrocities include the killing of four MQM prisoners
while in police custody in October; the murder of Syed Ehsan Ali
Shah, a brother of the Sind Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah, with
two other people on November 23; and the killing of 15 members of the
same family in a separate incident on the same day.

Fourteen people were sentenced to death  for terrorist acts on
November 27.

Political murder is not, however confined to Karachi, or even to Sind
province overall. Ali Ahmed Soomro, a former member of the ruling
Pakistan people's Party who had fallen out of favor was gunned down
outside his home in October (Prime Minister Bhutto's brother-in-law,
Nasir Hussain was questioned by police over the incident and
released).  In November, the provincial minister of Balochistan, Ayub
Buledi, the provincial election commissioner Faratullaha and their
driver were all shot dead in Turbat.

Political Corruption
The campaign to "get" former prime minister and opposition Pakistan
Muslim League (PML) leader Nawaz Sharif continues apace.  After
getting out from under a treason charge in September last year,
Sharif is now being undermined by the arrest of his brother, Shahbaz
Sharif, and a new pile of fraud allegations against his family.  In
order to ensure that the public at large recognizes the solidity of
the case being made, Interior Minister Babar outlined the allegations
on television on November 23.

According to Babar, the Sharif family fraudulently acquired a total
of Pr6.16 billion from 31 banks and financial institutions through
the use of political pressure during the period 1983-1993.

The government's case is that the money had been pressured out of
Pakistani banks and financial institutions by 19 companies owned by
the Sharif family.  A particular case in point is the family owned
Ittefaq Foundry (IF).  Records of the New York Branch of the National
Bank of Pakistan apparently show that IF opened letters of credit
with a number of nationalized banks in order to finance the import of
scrap metal worth US$17.84 million.

Not only did IF never meet any of its obligations on the letters of
credit, it also used political pressure to force the banks to adjust
the amount of the letters of credit by securing loans from the banks.
The scrap was sold on at a profit and none of the loans have ever
been repaid.

It is also claimed that during 1990-1993, IF sold machinery to 11
sugar mills for a total of Pr1,334 million.  The banks that financed
the deal were never repaid.  Moreover, political pressure was used to
force the sugar mills to buy machinery from IF and to force the banks
to make loans only to those mills that did agree to buy machinery
from IF.

Other scams allegedly indulged in by the family include the illegal
purchase of travelers' checks.  According to Babar, the family had
arranged the purchase of US$1.13 million worth of travelers' checks,
which were used as collateral "in a dubious manner" for securing
heavy loans.  Shahbaz Sharif is also accused of taking loans from
banks by forging signatures of other partners in his companies, like
Mian Khalid Diraj.

The problem for Nawaz Sharif in all this is that if his brother goes
down, Nawaz will almost certainly follow suit.

Afghanistan
The breakdown in relations with the regime of President Borhanoddin
Rabbani remains as deep as ever.  On November 22, the Pakistani
government stopped issuing permits for the transport of goods and
foodstuffs to Afghanistan until further notice and on November 28 it
expelled two representatives of the Hezb-e Wahdat faction, which is
allied to the Rabbani government.  These latest expulsions bring the
total of those expelled since the sacking of the Pakistani embassy in
Kabul in September to 19 Afghan diplomats and 11 officials, plus
Masud Khalili, the Afghan president's special representative in
Islamabad.

PAKISTAN
ECONOMY

The government has dismissed as baseless the general chorus of alarm
which greeted its decision to devalue the Pakistani rupee by 7% at
the end of October.  The decision was not, she argued, forced on the
government by the domestic economic situation, but by the fact that
both Bangladesh and India had devalued their currencies.  Given the
competing nature of these economies, vis-`-vis Pakistan, Pakistan had
no alternative but to follow suit in order to maintain its
competitive edge in world markets.

Whatever the reason for devaluation were in these countries, she
argued, the fact that Pakistan needed to devalue by only 7% was an
indicator of its relative economic strength.  Indeed, she claimed,
rather than experiencing an economic decline, as some domestic
observers maintained, the economy was actually going from strength to
strength, recording a consistent rise in the GDP over the past two
years.

Any damage to the economy, she said, was being done by the media,
whose reports were responsible for more than US$300 million in
capital being withdrawn from the banks and stock exchanges prior to
the devaluation.  This capital flight, she said, also reflected the
evil intentions of the vested interests who have no concern about the
national interest, but will do anything to serve their own interests.

For its part the government said the media had seized on the fact
that the 6.9% GDP growth target for 1994/95 had not been met (GDP
growth in the year was actually 4.7%, compared with 3.8% in 1993/94)
and had blown it up out of all proportion.  This failure, it
intimated, was a minor, almost technical matter, due to the cotton
sector failing to meet its production target, as it has for the past
three years, to some other crops had been damaged by rains and
floods, and to problems in the textile sector.  Despite all this,
industrial output grew by 5% in 1994/95 against 4.5% in 1993/94.

A rather more accurate summation of the situation was given by
President Leghari in an address to parliament on October 29.
Although he too dismissed all talk of an economic crisis, he did
admit that economic performance in 1994/95 was "mixed".  On the
positive side inflation remains under control, the GDP is expanding,
and fiscal and monetary policy should enable the inflation rate to
less than 10% in the 1995/96 year.  In addition, the rapid growth in
exports had resulted in a substantial increase in foreign exchange
reserves.

On the downside, the president admitted that reserves had begun to
decline, but that the most pressing problem was the fiscal deficit.
This stands somewhat at odds with the government's claim of success
in bringing the deficit down from 8% of GDP in November 1994 to 5.5%
of GDP in 1994/95.  The deficit is forecast to fall to 5% in 1995/96,
with the GDP expanding by 6.5%.

According to the government, its borrowing on the domestic market had
been reduced to Pr30 billion from Pr60 billion in 1994, and it has
repaid foreign loans of US$200 million, for the first time.  With
the privatization of the Kot Addu power plant, the repayment of
another US$700 million in foreign debt will be repaid.  The total
foreign debt now stands at around US$30 billion.

In November, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (EEC)
announced a number of initiatives to promote growth.  The support
price of wheat was increased from Pr160 to Pr165 per 40 kg to help
boost to agricultural growth.  In addition, the limit on loans
without collateral was raised fromPr50,000 to Pr100,000 to help the
development of the small business sector.  Action was also taken to
boost the industrial output of some products that suffer from
smuggling.

Inward Investment
Foreign investment rose by US$0.65 billion in the 1994/95 year to
US$1.53 billion. The main investing countries are the USA, Canada,
the UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

As for the current, 1995/96, year, the flow of foreign investment
more than doubled in the first three months (July-September 1995)
compared with the first quarter of 1994/95, to US$250 million,
despite an "erratic" stock market.  Of the total investment, more
than US$220 million was in direct investment as compared with US$106
million in the first quarter of last year.

According to the Board of Investment, the private foreign investment
flow in 1994/995 amounted to over US$1.5 billion, compared with
US$640 million in 1993/94..

SRI LANKA
POLITICS

The government launched its second and final offensive - Operation
Rivieresa (Sunshine) - against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in the Jaffna peninsula on October 1.  In announcing the
attack the deputy defense minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said the
government had no intention of slowing or aborting the war, but
intend to press on to finish it by the end of the year.  The actual
result has been less decisive than the government had hoped..

In terms of conventional military confrontation, the offensive has
been highly successful. Outnumbering the LTTE in men and materiel, as
well as in training and tactics, the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), made
steady advance towards the city of Jaffna throughout October, tough
its progress did slow significantly as it drew nearer to its target
and LTTE defense became more and more desperate.  Well over 1,000
LTTE fighters were killed in the operation and the SLA finally
entered Jaffna proper on the morning of November 20.

However, the LTTE has refused to surrender or to negotiate.  Despite
the loss of the city which formed the capital of the LTTE's Tamil
Eelam, the organization's leader, Veluppillai Prabhakaran, has
dispersed part of his forces to the eastern coastal area with the aim
of continuing a guerrilla war against the state, while in Jaffna
proper up to 1,000 still continue to engage the SLA.

The LTTE's ability to wreak havoc well outside of Jaffna was
demonstrated, again, even during the SLA's offensive.  On October 20
it launched an attack on the strategic Kolonnawa and Urogodawatte oil
installations.  Fortunately for the government, the terrorists missed
their main target, the gasoline tanks in zone two of the 95 acre
site, and set fire to two kerosene tanks and a diesel tank instead.
On November 11, LTTE suicide bombers set off two explosions near the
SLA's headquarters in the capital, Colombo, killing at least 20
civilians and injuring 30 others.

The fact that a crushing military defeat for the LTTE in Jaffna will
not necessarily mean the end of its guerrilla and terror operations,
has always been recognized by the government.  Its hope, however, is
that establishing its control in the Jaffna peninsula will enable it
to install a democratically elected provincial Tamil  government in
the area.  This coupled with generous development aid, should, it is
hoped, undercut popular support for the LTTE.  Without extensive
grassroots support, the LTTE will find it increasingly difficult to
mount its guerrilla and terror operations.

To the government's credit it has gone out of its way to secure the
support of the democratic Tamil parties for this program.  In their
turn, these parties, particularly the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front (EPRLF) and the Eelam people's Democratic Party
(EPDP).  The EPDP, in particular, has suffered a great deal at the
hands of the LTTE.  In October, the EPDP claimed that the LTTE had
killed more than 3,000 Tamil political activists since 1986.  Of
these, 1,700 were members of the EPDP, while most of the remainder
belonged to the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO).  Those
killed included the leader of TELO, Sri Sabaratnam, the former leader
of the opposition A. Amirthalingam, and the human rights' lawyer Sam
Thambimuthu.  The LTTE stepped up its offensive against its rivals in
1987 after the Indo-Sri Lanka pact was signed.

Despite its confident progress on the military front, the government
very nearly suffered a major political embarrassment at the beginning
of November when the ubiquitous Doctor G.L. Peiris handed in his
resignation.  As deputy prime minister, deputy finance minister,
justice minister and constitutional affairs minister. Peiris's loss
could well have thrown the government into turmoil.

The cause of the upset was a row between Peiris and the Secretary to
the Treasury A.S. Jayewardene over the settlement of a long-pending
controversy over a hotel.  Not surprisingly, President Kumaratunga
refused to accept Peiris's resignation, and the matter was settled
when Jayewardene resigned instead.

With the LTTE resolved to continue to prosecute a guerrilla war, the
government has looked again at the organization's financing.  This
was brought into sharp relief in early November when two Catholic
priests - Saverimuttu Jebanason, secretary to the Bishop in Jaffna,
and Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius of the Faxel Center of the Catholic
Church in nearby Kilinochchi - were stopped on their way to Jaffna
and found to be smuggling large amounts of cash and possible
bomb-making equipment.

The Revered Saverimuttu Jebanason was found to be carrying Sr11.27
million, while the Reverend Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius had Sr2.2
million.  The money, together with copper wire and batteries, was
found in the false bottoms of their suitcases.

Subsequent police investigation found that the two men had a total of
Sr24 million (Jebanason Sr19 million and Pius Sr5 million) in various
bank accounts.  This money, the police allege, was the result of a
laundering operation to channel funds from various organizations to
the LTTE. Part of the money found in the bank accounts, Sr1.5
million, appears to have originated from a series of bank robberies
carried out by an LTTE member, Kuttimani, in the early 1980s.
Kuttimani was killed while in detention during the prison riots in
Colombo in 1983.  However, it now appears that before his death he
entrusted at least Sr1.5 million of the money he stole to the priests
to be invested in a finance company.

The authorities also believe that members of the Catholic clergy in
are involved in a multi-million rupee foreign exchange racket to
channel funds to the LTTE.  They have now asked for Interpol
assistance to pursue the investigation.

According to government sources, around US$8 million and Sr10 million
was collected from various foreign and local individuals and
organizations for the LTTE over the past few years.  They also claim
that another important source of income for the LTTE is drug
trafficking in the USA Europe and Asia.  According to the Foreign
Ministry, about 481,000 Sri Lankans went abroad after 1983, the
majority of them Tamils and LTTE sympathizers, many of whom
contribute to the LTTE.

Of these expatriates, 60,000 are in Italy, 25,000 in Switzerland,
30,000 in Denmark, 60,000 in Canada, 20,000 in the USA, 5,000 in the
Netherlands, 60,000 in France, 70,000 in the UK, 65,000 in Germany
and 53,000 in India.  In future, fund raisers who maintain bank
accounts in support of the LTTE can be indicted and bank accounts
frozen under the emergency regulations.

SRI LANKA
ECONOMY

The economy continued to improve during the first seven months of
1995, despite rising defense expenditure, largely as a result of a
20% increase in exports, compared with the same period of 1994.
Exports in the first seven months of last year US$2.072 billion.

Amazingly, tourism was also up, with a total of 280,000 tourists
visiting the country by the end of August.  The rise in exports and
tourism receipts boosted the foreign exchange reserves to Sr136,868
by the end of August.

The manufacturing sector grew by 9% in real terms last year and
accounted for 95% of the overall growth in the GDP. Overall, the GDP
is estimated to have grown by 5.5% last year.

This year, the government is aiming for a GDP growth of over 6%.
Total investment in relation to GDP is projected to rise to about 27%
from 25.5% last year.  The agricultural sector is expected to grow by
3%, while exports are projected to grow by Sr44,592 million, with
industrial exports rising by 18% to Sr183,104 million.

SRI LANKA
FINANCE

However, with defense expenditure expected to have soared to Sr30-33
billion by the end of last year against a 1995 budget estimate of
Sr24 billion has thrown the government's finances off balance.  The
additional defense expenditure, coupled with higher than expected
costs for the government's wheat subsidy and rising debt service
costs are expected to have pushed last year's budget deficit up to
around 9.3% of GDP, compared with the budget target of 7.5% of GDP.

As a result, even if the military operations against the LTTE
continue to go in the government's failure, Sri Lanka is going to
have to live with high budget deficits right through to the end of
the century.

The 1996 budget, presented to parliament on November 8, projects
revenues at Sr18 billion.  On the expenditure side, a combination of
cuts and savings of Sr4.6 million produced a gross spending figure of
Sr273.4 billion.  Against this there is Sr185.9 billion in revenue
and grants, resulting in an overall deficit of Sr87.4 billion.  This
is to be met by foreign borrowings of Sr32.7 billion and domestic
non-inflationary financing of Sr54.7 billion.   Overall, the
government is projecting a budget deficit of l7.8% of GDP this year,
to be followed by deficits of 6.6% in 1997 and 5.1% in 1998.

The budget package includes a package of tax concessions, reductions
in excise and customs duties, measures to develop the capital market
and investment, and a salary hike to civil servants.  The defense
levy introduced in 1992 and currently standing at 4.5% will continue
at that level for through this year, but under a new name, the
national security levy.  It will however be reduced to 2% for imports
of capital goods.

The tax exemption threshold has been increased from Sr60,000 to
Sr100,000.  This will cost the government Sr40 million in lost
revenue.  The intermediate tax rates have also been reduced - the
first Sr35,000 within the tax bracket will be subject to a 10% rate,
the next bracket 15%, and the next two brackets to 25% and 35%.

The budget introduces a new consolidated welfare program in place of
the existing welfare programs.  Under this, the most vulnerable
families will be given a monthly income transfer of Sr1,000 per
family, while other poor families are given Sr500 per family.  There
are also incentives to sustain high production in the agricultural
sector.

High priority will continue to be given to public enterprise reforms
with a view to encouraging inward investment in the main sectors of
the economy.  Peiris noted that last year's foreign aid commitment of
US$843 million was confirmation of foreign confidence of the
government's handling of both the economy and the military conflict.

On specific allocations, fundamental economic facilities are to
receive Sr14,900 million and ports' expansion Sr5,500 million. Large
financial allocations have been made for transportation,
telecommunications, power and highways.  The estimated expenditure on
fundamental facilities is Sr6,920 million; agriculture Sr4,800
million and the development of social infrastructure (education,
health and youth affairs) Sr7,160 million.
