<H2>
User Group Inaugurated at Online World
</H2>
A NewsNet User Group meeting was convened for the first time during the Online 
World Conference in Washington, D.C. this past October. <P>

NewsNet staff, users, and interested parties met over breakfast on Tuesday, 
October 29, 1996, to exchange ideas, have questions answered, discuss industry
trends, and find out what NewsNet is planning for the coming months. Andrew S.
Elston, NewsNet's President, began the meeting by welcoming all and giving a 
summary of NewsNet's history-to-date.<P>

Elston was followed by Carol E. Arscott, NewsNet User Group Liaison, who gave a
brief presentation on the purpose for forming the group, and a synopsis of what
we all hope the group will accomplish in time-for the benefit of all NewsNet 
users.<P>

As you can imagine, a good deal of discussion focused on the Web and its 
implications for all of our future information needs. Michael Stein, Vice
President of Software Development, was on hand to address these issues and to 
answer users' questions about NewsNet's dependable Windows-based Baton 
product also.<P>

The outlook for a strong and active user group is promising. "The User Group 
has the capability to become a strong force within the company. We want to 
hear what NewsNet users like about the system and what they'd like to see
improved further," said Arscott. "We want NewsNet users involved in shaping the
future of NewsNet."<P>

The next meeting is planned for May of 1997 in conjunction with the National 
Online Conference in New York City.<P>

If you are interested in future NewsNet User Group activities, please contact 
Carol E. Arscott at 1-800-345-1301 (or, 610-527-8030 outside of the U.S. or
Canada) or via e-mail at info@newsnet.com.<P>
