<P>Your insurance company may have the right to schedule you for what
is called an Independent Medical Examination, or "IME."  This is a common
practice if you are receiving Personal Injury Protection benefits, or if
you have filed a lawsuit to receive compensation for your injuries.  The
IME will involve giving a medical history and going through a physical exam
conducted by one or more doctors chosen by the insurance company.
<P>These examinations may be called "independent," but you should be aware
that the doctor  is getting paid for the examination by the insurance company.
 Some doctors make a significant part of their living conducting these
examinations for insurance companies.
<H3>The PIP IME
</H3><P>If you have Personal Injury Protection (PIP) or Med Pay benefits,
your insurance company may want to get a second opinion.  The obligation
of the company is to pay reasonable and necessary expenses, and if the insurance
company is concerned about the amount of your medical bills or duration of
your ongoing treatment, they may have the right to send you to a doctor of
their choosing.
<P>If this doctor concludes that your treatment is no longer warranted, the
PIP carrier may stop paying for your medical treatment.  In that event, you
may have a right to demand an arbitration or sue your insurance company.
 A lawyer can advise you regarding these alternatives.
<P>Before attending a PIP IME, be sure to ask your lawyer, if you have one,
whether it is in your best interest to attend.  If you do not attend the
IME, the insurance company will probably cut off further payment of medical
bills and/or wage loss.  However, in some circumstances it may be preferable
to allow this to happen than to go through the IME, especially if litigation
is probable.
<H3>The Litigation IME
</H3><P>If a lawsuit has already been filed, the insurance company may want
to have you examined by a doctor who would be prepared to testify in court
if the case goes to trial.  The civil rules of procedure in most states allow
such examinations, and you will be required to attend.  It is probable that
the examining doctor will reach different conclusions than your own treating
doctor about your condition.

<H3>Tips on handling any IME
</H3><P>Here are some suggestions on how to handle an IME:
<UL><LI>Be aware that you may be observed from the moment you enter the parking
lot until the time you drive off.  We  see comments in the reports dealing
with how a client got out of a car or walked across the parking lot.
<LI>Do not answer questions dealing with fault in the accident.  You should
answer only those questions that are directed to medical issues.
<LI>Under no circumstances should you get angry or argumentative with the
examiners.  If you do, they will probably record that in their report and
it will not help your case.
<LI>If possible, have someone accompany you to the exam.  Have that person
note how long each portion of the  exam lasts.
<LI>Describe your pain and medical condition truthfully and completely. 
Do not let the doctor trap you with questions which attribute pain to areas
clearly not associated with your injury.
<LI>Don't be afraid to say "Ouch" when you hurt.  If you grimace and the
doctor does not see it, your reaction will not be noted.
<LI>Remember: THIS IS NOT YOUR DOCTOR.  Anything you tell this doctor will
<STRONG>not </STRONG>be confidential and can be used by your insurance company
against you.
<LI>After the IME, write down what the doctor said and what the doctor did
to you.
<LI>Call your lawyer immediately after the IME.
<LI>You are entitled to receive a copy of the IME report.
<LI>If you cannot attend the IME at the scheduled time, call your lawyer
immediately or call the doctor's office to reschedule, otherwise you may
be charged a cancellation fee.
