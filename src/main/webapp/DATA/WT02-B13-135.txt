<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton
Reverses Policy on Cubans</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
President Clinton on August 19 announced a dramatic change in the 28-year old
US policy toward Cuban refugees.  Henceforth, persons from the island nation
heading for the US on rafts and small boats are to be treated as illegal
aliens, detained in centers outside the US, and not permitted to enter the US
unless they can satisfy the criteria for refugee or immigrant status
individually.  <p>
<p>
The US policy change was due to the rising number of Cubans arriving on rafts
and small boats--about 20,000 in August, including 3,000 per day on August
24-25.  Talks between Cuba and the United States to stem the exodus began on
September 1.<p>
<p>
Both the US and Cuba have been using migration policy as foreign policy
instruments.  The US put an economic embargo on Cuba in 1960 and, under the
Cuban Refugee Act of 1966, Cubans who arrived in the US were paroled or allowed
to remain and work legally, become US immigrants after one year of residence,
and apply for US citizenship after five years.  The US did not return to Cuba
even Cubans who used violence to escape. <p>
<p>
As economic conditions worsened in Cuba, Cubans began to slip out despite
Castro's efforts to prevent their emigration.  After several ferries were
hijacked in August by Cubans bound for the US, Castro accused the US government
of encouraging Cubans to use violence to escape.  In mid-August, Cuba
apparently began allowing Cubans to leave freely.<p>
<p>
Cuba seems to be using the flood of migrants as a lever to get the US to
negotiate an end to the economic embargo.  The US response has been to instead
tighten the embargo, which suggests that the US hopes that yet more pressure
will lead to a change of government in Cuba.  The US announced that the current
"mid-level" talks with Cuba will cover only "orderly legal immigration."  Cuba
announced that it would prevent those leaving Cuba from taking children with
them on rafts.<p>
<p>
After the policy change August 19, some 18,000 Cubans were picked up at sea and
taken to safe haven at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  There are
already almost 15,000 Haitians at Guantanamo.  On August 24, the US announced
plans to expand the tent camps at Guantanamo to hold up to 40,000 Cubans there.
Panama and Honduras promised to take up to 15,000 Cubans for up to 6 months.<p>
<p>
Cubans taken to Guantanamo will not be admitted to the US unless they qualify
individually for refugee or immigrant status.  The US has an interest section
in Havana that in 1994 granted refugee status to 3,000 Cubans.  US authorities
urged Cubans to seek refugee or immigrant status in Havana rather than risk
their lives setting out to sea.  Under a 1984 amendment to US immigration law,
the US agreed to allocate up to 20,000 immigrant visas annually to Cubans and,
under the 1990 IMMACT, this number rose to 27,845.  <p>
<p>
However, Cubans would have to compete with 3.4 million other foreigners who are
awaiting immigrant visas to enter the United States.  There is speculation
that, if Cubans were to receive special treatment yet again by receiving a
higher priority in the immigration queue, Asian-Americans may protest.<p>
<p>
Cubans are attempting to flee in response to the economic crisis in Cuba caused
by the sharp decrease in Russian subsidies and a poor sugar crop.  In 1994,
Australia is expected to replace Cuba as the world's top sugar exporter.  <p>
<p>
In 1980, during the Mariel boat lift, 124,769 Cubans migrated to the US in 159
days, usually via private boats that traveled the 90 miles from southern
Florida to the harbor in Mariel, Cuba.  The US is seeking to avoid another
Mariel--US Attorney General Reno warned private US boat owners in August that
they may be arrested and have their boats confiscated if they attempt to travel
to Cuba and return with Cubans.  However, private boaters are permitted to pick
up Cubans at sea who are in danger of drowning.  <p>
<p>
By some estimates, from 1 to 2 million of the 11 million Cubans would migrate
to the US if they could.  Almost one-third of the 36 million people in the
Caribbean live in Cuba, and there are about 1.5 million Cuban-Americans in the
US.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Commission
Recommends That States Test Employee Verification</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR) on August 3, 1994
recommended unanimously in testimony to the Senate Judiciary's Immigration
Subcommittee that a national registry of the names and social security numbers
of all persons authorized to work in the US be established to deter illegal
aliens from obtaining US jobs.  CIR Chair Barbara Jordan urged that the
registry be established immediately, and be used on a trial basis to check
newly hired workers in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, New York,
and Texas.  These states include 35 percent of the US population, and 80
percent of the estimated 4 million illegal immigrants in the US.<p>
<p>
The federal registry would include data from the Social Security Administration
and the INS.  Illegal aliens would be deterred in test states by registry data,
plus counterfeit-resistant drivers licenses, secure Social Security cards, and
telephone verification systems.  Implementing these immigration control
measures may require federal and state legislation.<p>
<p>
The CIR's proposal to tighten employee verification systems was praised by INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner and by senators such as Diane Feinstein
(D-California), who believe that illegal immigration must be brought under
control.  Press reaction was generally favorable; the CIR's proposals were
described in major papers as "logical steps" to regain control over illegal
immigration.  The registry proposal was denounced by ethnic and civil rights
groups such as La Raza and the American Immigration Lawyers Association as a
national ID system.<p>
<p>
The CIR also endorsed more border control efforts, such as Operation
Hold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas.  By flooding the border with agents, the INS
has sharply reduced attempted illegal entries in El Paso, and also reduced the
crime associated with youthful illegal entrants.  According to a report by a
team headed by Frank Bean of the University of Texas, long-distance illegal
migrants continue to attempt entry to the US, but not at El Paso.<p>
<p>
The popularity of Operation Hold-the-Line prompted Governor Wilson to propose
that a similar operation should be mounted on the San Diego-Tijuana border.
There is speculation that such an operation may be mounted by the Clinton
Administration to deflect support for Governor Wilson and the Save our State
illegal immigration initiative on the November ballot.<p>
<p>
The CIR asserted that illegal aliens should receive no benefits except for
health care in emergencies and public education for illegal alien children.
Public education typically accounts for more than half of the state and local
costs associated with illegal immigration, and state and local governments are
required to provide free public education under the 1982 Phyler vs. Doe U.S.
Supreme Court decision.  CIR Chair Jordan acknowledged the legitimate concerns
over the costs of illegal immigration in high immigration states such as
California, but denounced Wilson and the SOS initiative as unnecessarily
inflaming tensions over illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
The CIR is expected to issue its interim report on controlling back-door
illegal immigration by September 30, 1994, and then tackle issues related to
front-door legal immigration.  Among the issues to be addressed are immigrant
entrepreneurship---how many new jobs do immigrant businesses create, for whom,
and with what impacts on their communities--and immigrant family and civic
structures--do immigrant families strengthen "family values?"<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Haitians
Begin To Return Home</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On July 31, 1994, the UN Security Council approved the use of force to restore
President Aristide to power in Haiti.  Troops from several neighboring
Caribbean islands have been training with US troops for an invasion and, by the
end of August, an invasion appeared imminent.<p>
<p>
The number of Haitian boat people dwindled after they learned that they would
not be given entry to the US, and in early August the US announced that the
16,500 Haitians in Guantanamo would stay there rather than be moved to safe
havens in nearby nations such as Suriname, Panama and Honduras, which had
offered to permit the US construction of safe havens for Haitians in their
territory in exchange for increased US assistance.  The US has spent over $160
million in 1994 on camps and processing for Haitians.<p>
<p>
More Haitians began to leave the tent city set up for them in the US's
Guatanamo Bay Naval Base than arrived by mid-August.  In the three weeks
preceding August 15, for example, over 1,000 Haitians returned, while the US
Coast Guard picked up only 300 Haitians fleeing their country in small boats.
Between mid-June and mid-August, over 5,000 Haitians returned to Haiti.<p>
<p>
The Haitian crisis has inspired calls for open borders.  On the editorial page
of the Wall Street Journal, a newspaper that has endorsed an amendment to the
US Constitution that the US should have open borders, a Manhattan Institute
affiliate asserted that "Haitians make great Americans" by increasing
productivity and holding down the US cost of living.  Even though today's
Haitians include many single men without family ties, "the long-standing
Haitian-American commitment to self-improvement" provides sufficient assurance
that they will successfully integrate.  <p>
<p>
However, in New York City, where half of the adult Haitians have some college
education, seven percent of the Haitian immigrants-- and 25 percent of
second-generation Haitians--are on welfare.<p>

<a name="RTFToC5">
Immigration and Politics in California</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The debate over immigration in California is rekindling interest in the role of
Latino voters in statewide campaigns.  Latinos are between 25 and 30 percent of
California's 32 million people, but they are only 12 percent of California's
registered voters, and they accounted for only about seven percent of the
voters in the June 1994 primary elections.  Latino State Senator Art Torres is
running for Insurance Commissioner, and the SOS initiative will be on the
November 7 ballot, so some hope that the Latino vote could decide close
races.<p>
<p>
Why are there as many Black as Latino voters in California, even though there
are four times more Latinos than Blacks?  Half of the adult Latinos are not US
citizens; a smaller-than-average-percentage are eligible to register and vote
than do so; there is a much-discussed lack of "charismatic ethnic leadership;"
and Latinos are not monolithic Democratic voters--typically 55 to 60 percent
vote for Democrats.<p>
<p>
Governor Pete Wilson has said he is likely to vote for the SOS
initiative--Proposition 187 on the November 8 ballot--but he has not yet
formally endorsed it, nor has he actively campaigned for its passage.  Wilson
has mentioned his support for the SOS provision that would deny free public
education to illegal alien children.  He has said that, if SOS is approved, he
would welcome a California lawsuit to challenged the 1982 US Supreme Court
decision that required states to provide free public education for illegal
alien children.<p>
<p>
Wilson has reportedly been more concerned with eliminating federal mandates
that require states provide services to aliens, and with getting the federal
government to reimburse states for the costs of providing those services, than
denying aliens services such as health care, as SOS would do.  SOS opponents
counter that Wilson's attacks on illegal immigrants created the atmosphere in
which SOS could be put on the ballot, and that he is now trying to look
"responsible" by using anti-immigrant rhetoric but not endorsing an "extremist"
initiative.<p>
<p>
On August 25, 1994, Wilson had a full page ad in the New York Times asserting
California had done what it could to deal with illegal immigration--requiring
proof of legal status to get a driver's license, prohibiting local governments
from enacting sanctuary laws, and sending the National Guard to provide support
services for the Border Patrol.  Wilson appealed to President Clinton to order
the Border Patrol to implement an Operation Hold-the-Line in San Diego, to have
the federal government take custody of illegal aliens convicted of crimes in
California, and to implement the tamper-proof national registry system proposed
by the CIR in California (see related story).<p>
<p>
For the first time since employer sanctions went into effect in 1987, the
former manager of a Los Angeles medical clinic was indicted on charges that she
repeatedly accepted false documents from illegal alien workers.  Leticia Ruiz
de la Cruz, 40, was charged with knowingly accepting false Social Security and
Green Cards from illegal workers hired to work in the clinics.  A disgruntled
former employee turned clinic documents over to the INS.<p>
<p>
In San Francisco, a state appeals court on August 15 ruled that unauthorized
aliens who are eligible for emergency medical services and pregnancy care may
be required to confirm their illegal status when they seek such care.  IRCA
made unauthorized aliens eligible for such medical services, and California has
estimated that the cost of providing mandated health services to 317,500 aliens
is $395 million annually, or $1250 each.  <p>
<p>
The court ruled that the California rule requiring applicants for medical
services to declare their legal status does not conflict with federal law,
because even after they are identified as illegal aliens, they receive
services.  However, if SOS were approved and implemented, all government
employees would be required to inform INS of unauthorized aliens.<p>
<p>
In San Diego County, the Board of Supervisors voted 4-0 to cross check voter
registration lists with INS records to determine if non-US citizens have
registered to vote.  Under US law, persons registering to vote do not have to
show proof of citizenship; they need only sign an affidavit that they are
citizens.  Non-citizens who register can be prosecuted for perjury.<p>
<p>
In a July 12-17 Field Poll, illegal immigration was the 15th most important
issue for California voters, but it was more important to older voters, men,
and was the third most important issue for Republicans.<p>
<p>
On August 5, 1994, the US District Court in San Francisco ruled that a Chinese
citizen Seventh-Day Adventist who had lived in Hong Kong for 12 years before
immigrating to the US could not apply for asylum here because he was "firmly
resettled" in Hong Kong.  Mr. Chan applied for asylum in the US  because he
feared religious persecution after the Chinese assume control of Hong Kong in
1997.  The INS denied his application because he had "firmly resettled" in a
third country prior to coming to the United States.  The court upheld the INS
denial, noting that Chan and his wife owned property in Hong Kong. <p>
<p>
The District Court found that the INS has broad rule-making authority pursuant
to the Refugee Act of 1980.  The court said that since the INS could use its
discretionary authority to consider resettlement as a factor in evaluating the
merits of asylum applications during litigation, then it could also make a rule
based on that factor. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Court
Decisions Changes INS Policies</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
As a result of a court decision, the INS will now take custody of aliens who
stowaway in ships or airplanes, and permit them to remain in the US while their
requests for asylum are considered.  Unlike illegal aliens apprehended in the
US, stowaways detected at air and sea ports are legally considered not to be in
the US, and the air or shipping company on which they arrived was responsible
for holding them until the INS decided whether they could remain or should be
returned at the carriers expense.  A shipping company sued the government for
the costs it incurred while holding Romanian stowaways for almost two months,
and a federal court of appeals ruled that the old INS policy of requiring
transportation companies to cover the costs of holding stowaways had not be
properly adopted.<p>
<p>
Under the new rules, the INS will permit stowaways to e.g., apply for asylum,
and then release them on their own recognizance.  If their applications are
rejected, the transportation company that brought them to the US is responsible
for the cost of transporting them home.<p>
<p>
In the closely-watched Golden Venture case, in which a Chinese freighter was
grounded off New York City in 1993, a Manhattan federal judge ruled that
Xin-Chang Zhang can claim asylum because of China's one-child policy.  The
judge ruled that executive orders during the Bush administration which say
China's one-child policy is a basis for US asylum overrides other court rulings
that conclude it is not.  The INS is likely to appeal the decision.  <p>
<p>
Another ruling is likely to have more of an impact.  The judge ruled that the
immigration courts improperly interpreted when an immigrant has legally entered
the United States.  Zhang's rights were curtailed because he was on US soil
when he was arrested.  The judge ruled that as soon as immigrants enter US
territorial waters, they have the same rights as an alien in the US, a ruling
that may affect US policies toward Haitian refugees.  The INS is expected to
appeal the decision.  <p>
<p>
The Clinton administration has decided to give refugee status to Chinese
immigrants who claim they will be punished for opposing abortion in their
homeland.  This would halt the deportation of many Chinese immigrants who say
they would be persecuted for resisting abortions or mandatory sterilization. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Texas
Sues over Costs of Illegal Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Texas joined Florida, Arizona, California, and New Jersey on August 3 in suing
the federal government for the costs state and local governments incur as a
result of providing services to illegal immigrants.  Except for the costs
associated with imprisoning and deporting criminal illegal aliens, the federal
government has resisted providing such reimbursement, saying that the states
have not been able to justify adequately the amount of reimbursement they are
seeking.  <p>
<p>
There was a wave of similar suits in the mid-1980s, before IRCA was enacted and
states were eligible for SLIAG moneys to cover the costs of providing services
to newly-legalized aliens.  The US Supreme Court in 1985 ruled against state
reimbursement suits; it suggested that the states use the political process to
secure federal funds to cover the costs of immigration.  However, in a 1992
case involving New York, the US Supreme Court indicated that it was willing to
have federal courts play a role in the argument over federal reimbursement.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">
Five-year Low in German Asylum Seekers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Since 1990, 1,209,965 foreigners have applied for asylum in Germany, including
438,191 in 1992 and 322,599 in 1993.  On July 1, 1993, Germany's asylum law was
amended to require that applicants from "safe countries" apply and then return
to their country of origin, and applicants who passed through safe countries en
route to Germany&nbsp;to apply for asylum there.  <p>
<p>
Some 161,492 foreigners applied for asylum between July 1, 1993 and June 30,
1994, but in July 1994, the number of applicants reached a five year low of
8,730.  There were 71,532 asylum seekers in the first seven months of 1994 and,
in July 1994, 7.6 percent of the 27,681 asylum applications considered were
approved.  The German Office for the Recognition of Refugees is being
streamlined to deal with a projected 25,000 asylum seekers annually.<p>
<p>
There is a remarkable optimism that the 1993 asylum reform  has "worked":
applications are down, and most cases are heard within three or four days.
With less than 10 percent of the applicants recognized as refugees during these
speedy proceedings, the word is getting out that it is not easy to obtain
asylum in Germany.  <p>
<p>
The almost 9,000 people monthly who continue to enter Germany and seek asylum
usually present no travel documents or written proof that they face persecution
at home.  Typical is a 32 year-old Iranian man who crossed the Iranian-Turkish
border on foot, traveled by car across Turkey, and then used a false passport
to fly from Istanbul to Frankfurt.  The passport was taken by the smuggler, and
this man entered Germany--if he had applied for asylum<b> </b>without documents
at the airport, he would have remained in an airport camp while the application
was decided.  This man allegedly faced persecution in Iran because of his
wife's support for dissidents there.<p>
<p>
Most such applications are rejected as "apparently unfounded."  Applicants
receiving such decisions are expected to leave Germany within one week--if they
do not, they can be deported--20,000 were in 1992, and 37,000 were in 1993.
However, many manage to delay their departure.  First, those without papers
must order new passports--and pay appropriate fees for them if they have money
-- from their countries' German embassies.  Some countries do not easily or
quickly issue replacement passports, and some asylum applicants allege that
applying to their country's German embassy or consulate subjects them to
persecution at home.  <p>
<p>
Second, those who arrived over land borders must admit to, e.g., crossing the
Polish-German border before Poland is obliged to take them back--few have been
returned so far to neighboring "safe countries."  Third, many of those whose
applications are rejected are nonetheless allowed to remain in Germany,
especially if there is a civil war in their country of origin.  For this
reason, applicants often purchase and present Bosnian or Somalian passports,
since applicants from these countries are often "tolerated" with  Temporary
Protected Status.<p>
<p>
Human rights organizations complain that applicants have only one to two hours
to tell their story, that "deciders" must make an average two decisions daily,
that rejected applicants have only one week to appeal a rejection, and the
courts just one more week to consider the appeal, and that applicants can be
returned in a step-by-step fashion to the country of origin they fled, e.g. an
applicant from Iran being returned first to Turkey and then to Iran.<p>
<p>
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther in mid-August reported that the number of
aliens apprehended on Germany's borders fell by half compared to 1993 to
20,000.  Most attempt to slip over the Czech and Polish borders, where Germany
has 4,400 Border Patrol agents.  The German Border Patrol has an annual budget
of DM 2.5 billion, or $1.6 billion.   <p>
<p>
According to a television network ZDF poll, one-fourth of the West Germans, and
11 percent of the East Germans, considered asylum seekers and foreigners to be
the top priority in Germany in July 1994.  By comparison, 56 percent of the
West Germans, and 76 percent of the East Germans, considered unemployment to be
the top priority.<p>
<p>
German's population rose in 1993 by 363,000 or 0.4 percent to 81.3 million.
There were 76,000 more deaths than births; the net immigration of foreigners
was 277,000 in 1993, versus 593,000 in 1992.  <p>
<p>
There continue to be more Germans----including ethnic Germans from the former
USSR--moving to Germany than emigrating.  In 1992, net "German" immigration was
195,000, and in 1993 it was 194,000.  Since 219,000 ethnic Germans arrived,
this indicates that 87,000 Germans emigrated.  In addition, there are expected
to be 20,000 illegal immigrants settling in Germany in 1994, versus 50,000 in
1993.<p>
<p>
In Buchenwald (in the eastern German state of Thuringia), 22 neo-Nazis stormed
through the concentration camp memorial in July.  Foreigners' Commissioner
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobson joined the criticism of police and prosecutors in
their handling of the case.  According to government data, 82 identified
neo-Nazi groups were blamed for 2,232 acts of reported violence in 1993,
including 1,609 against  foreigners.  However, Schmalz-Jacobson said that in
1993 there were 6,016 racist attacks. <p>
<p>
For the first time since 1989, the number of crimes recorded in Germany
declined, from 2.6 to 2.5 million.  The number of foreigners suspected of
committing crimes fell by 10 percent between the first half of 1993 and the
first half of 1994., <p>
<p>
British construction workers in Berlin have accused neo-Nazis of attacking them
on their Saturday afternoon sweeps of building sites.  Gangs armed with
baseball bats go from construction site to site looking for foreign workers.
British construction workers reportedly earn between $12 and $17 hourly.<p>
<p>
In 1992, Germany and Vietnam negotiated an agreement to have German funds pay
to reintegrate the Vietnamese who had been recruited to work in the former East
Germany.  However, 40,000 Vietnamese remain in Germany, and many have applied
for asylum there.  Germany is trying to negotiate an agreement with Vietnam so
that Vietnam will accept Vietnamese who "voluntarily" return.  Over half of the
Vietnamese who applied for asylum in Germany have had their applications
rejected.<p>
<p>
The Economist magazine warned that Europe was sliding down a slippery slope of
creating an underclass because of long-term unemployment--40 percent of the 17
million unemployed in the European Union have been out of work for at least a
year; including a third who have never worked at all.  Many of the unemployed
are immigrants or their children-- in the former West Berlin, the number of
unemployed foreigners nearly doubled between 1989 and 1993, while the
unemployment rate for ethnic Germans rose by less than one third.<p>
<p>
In early August, fundamentalists in Algeria killed five French citizens, and
France accused Germany of not being strict with Algerian fundamentalists who
live there.  Rabah Kebir, a fundamentalist Algerian FIS leader who was granted
asylum in Germany, was thought to have violated the terms of his stay in
Germany by making political statements and by illegal traveling to France.  On
July 24, 18 Algerian and other North African asylum seekers being held in a
camp in Kassel took several guards hostage.  Algeria has refused to accept its
nationals who have had their applications for asylum in Germany rejected.<p>

</a></h2>
<p>
The Czech Republic reports that the number of illegal immigrants apprehended on
its borders has fallen from 5,000 in January to less than 1,000 in June.  The
decline was attributed to new visa requirements for nationals of the former

EU Immigration Proposals Worry House of Lords</a>

The All-Party Committee of Peers has called for stronger immigration controls

British Parliament asked for a revision of plans for an EU-wide visa law,
warning that the EU law might restrict the travel rights of many Commonwealth

The House of Lords Select Committee on European Affairs said a proposed list of
citizens who will require visas to enter the EU is too long and includes many
nations of the Commonwealth, such as India, Barbados, and Grenada, many of whom
do not currently require visas for short stays in Britain.  The Lords argue
that the EU has no power to require mutual recognition of visas by member
states, or list countries whose nationals are required or not required to have
visas to travel to the EU.  <p>
<p>
The draft proposal on a common EU visa policy is considered by some to be
another step toward "Fortress Europe," and by others to be the first step
toward a border-free Europe for all those inside EU nationals.  Police argue
that identification checks with a common database and compatible computer
systems are necessary to stop drugs, car thieves and terrorism. <p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Foreign
Worker Fees in Taiwan</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are 140,000 foreign workers in Taiwan, but employers have applied for and
been granted permission to import 200,000 to 300,000.  About 100,000 are Thais
employed in factories and in construction, and 25,000 are Filipino maids and
nurses.  Foreign workers can remain in Taiwan for two years, and specialists
for three--the government plans to extend maximum stays to three and four
years.<p>
<p>
The Council of Labor Affairs announced in August, 1994 that it was thawing the
recruitment freeze imposed in April, but also planning to increase the fee
charged to employers to import foreign workers--currently NT$2,000 or $77-- in
order to reduce their reliance on foreign workers.  For the first time,
households with children under six or persons over 75 would be able to employ
foreigners as domestics.<p>
<p>
Private employers have been permitted to recruit foreign workers since 1991.
Under the current program, Taiwanese employers must pay at least basic monthly
salary-currently NT$ 13,350 ($515), pay a deposit of NT$26,000 that is refunded
after the foreign worker leaves in two years, and pay a monthly<p>
"employment stabilization fee" fee  that is meant to protect the interests of
Taiwanese workers--in manufacturing, this fee is currently NT$1,300 per month.
Employers must enroll foreign workers in the labor insurance and health
insurance programs. Employers must also pay recruitment and transportation
costs, and bring the workers into Taiwan within six months of being granted
approval.<p>
<p>
The Chinese National Federation of Industries protested the plan to raise the
CLA fee, arguing that, with all theses costs, additional fees and lower
productivity would make foreign workers too costly.  Instead, they asked for an
additional 11,000 foreign workers to fill so called 3-D jobs--dangerous,
difficult, or dirty, a relaxation of the minimum monthly wage, and an extension
from two to three years for the workers stay in Taiwan.  Industries seeking
foreign workers include tires, rubber and rubber products, and construction.<p>
<p>
A survey of Taiwanese workers found that 82 percent agree that foreign workers
are needed under certain conditions, but two-thirds oppose the importation of
mainland Chinese workers.  However, 42 percent of those surveyed fear that
foreign workers may threaten their jobs.  Taiwanese fishing companies have
received permission to import up to 10,000 mainland workers.  Taiwanese
employers must notify labor unions about their hiring of foreigners, and they
cannot fire local workers and replace them with foreigners.<p>
<p>
Foreign workers headed for Taiwan must attend classes on their rights and
obligations under Taiwan's labor laws, as well as on Taiwan's culture.  While
in Taiwan, they are required to have  physical examinations every six months.
The most common violation of labor laws occurs when Taiwanese employers
encourage excessive overtime work, reflecting the employers' desire to use
relatively cheap foreign workers as much as possible and the workers' desire to
maximize their savings.<p>
<p>
The foreign workers' most serious problem is exploitation by labor brokers.
Foreign factory workers can earn NT$ 16,000 to NT$ 20,000--$700--per month, or
$20,000 over the two-year stay permitted in Taiwan.  Competition among foreign
workers to be selected for jobs in Taiwan is very keen, and workers are willing
to pay NT$ 70,000 to NT$ 80,000 --equivalent to four to five months wages--to
obtain a work permit.  Most workers sign IOUs and have this "recruitment fee"
deducted from their wages in Taiwan.<p>
<p>
To escape from these recruitment fees, or to earn a higher wage, some foreign
workers abandon their designated job.  They thus become illegal alien workers.
The Taiwanese government is considering a proposal to amend the Employment
Service Law to establish penalties of imprisonment of up to five years and a
fine of up to NT$ 1.5 million for the collection of "excessive" brokerage fees
or the illegal employment and abusive treatment of  foreign workers.  The
government is also establishing foreign worker assistance centers .<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC19">Development
and Migration in Asia</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Does freer trade increase, decrease, or have no effect on unwanted migration?
The U.S. Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative
Economic Development<sup> </sup>established by IRCA in 1986 to deal with the
"root causes" of illegal immigration to the United States concluded that,
although free trade and investment were the best mutually beneficial policies
that emigration and immigration countries could adopt to accelerate their
development and eventually reduce unwanted immigration, such migration would
not be reduced quickly, and may even increase temporarily.  The prospect of an
unwanted "migration hump" in the wake of the "correct" economic policies to
accelerate stay-at-home development leads to a paradox--the same policies that
make immigration controls less necessary in the long-run make such controls
more necessary in the short-run, especially if one reason why immigration
countries implement free trade policies is to slow unwanted immigration.<p>
<p>
The OECD's Development Center held a seminar in July 1994 to discuss the
migration hump in successful (Korea, Taiwan) and failed (Philippines, Pakistan)
cases of economic development.  The successful cases were defined as those in
which previous net emigration countries became net immigration destinations
within a decade.  Most were in East Asia, and the "East Asian Miracle" of rapid
economic and employment growth that also reversed net migration flows was
attributed to the fostering of labor-intensive manufacturing industries that
created jobs and exported ever more sophisticated goods.  The absence of
segmented labor markets permitted the benefits of this export-led growth to be
shared, even by those not employed in manufacturing.  Rising manufacturing
wages also pulled up farm wages and incomes, there was less rural-urban
migration, less crowded urban labor markets, and less overseas migration.<p>
<p>
This seminar was significant because it represents one of the first attempts to
derive migration lessons from Asian Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs).  The
World Bank's recent study--The East Asian Miracle--demonstrates that Asian NICs
offer important lessons in how to manage developing economies in a manner that
promotes fast and equitable growth--they may also offer important lessons in
how to promote stay-at-home development.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Labor Migration in Asia</i><p>
<i></i>Asia, home to almost 60 percent of the world's population, has so far
not experienced the large-scale labor migrations that have moved immigration
and integration toward the top of the socio-political agenda in North America
and Western Europe.  However, uneven population and economic growth in the
region, combined with the recruitment of both professional and unskilled
migrant workers, the growth of tourism and labor smuggling, the toleration of
illegal workers, and rising expectations in job-short nations combine to
suggest that labor migration could change the face of Asia over the next
several decades.<p>
<p>
Japan, Korea, and Taiwan--the region's three major economic success
stories--are likely to become more dependent on foreign workers in the 1990s.
During pre-1980s economic booms, these countries were able to fill
newly-created jobs with baby boom workforce entrants, ex-farmers, and women
entering the labor force.  Today these reservoirs of additional domestic labor
have dried up, and foreign workers are becoming the workforce "shock absorbers"
for these economies in the 1990s.  All three countries are attempting to manage
growing numbers of foreign workers in a manner that prevents their
settlement.<p>
<p>
In Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, many foreign workers are employed in small
manufacturing firms--operations with less than 50 workers employ two-thirds or
more of the manufacturing workers.  These firms tend to offer 3-D
jobs--difficult, dirty, and dangerous--and, even though the small firms in
which many of these jobs are found in some cases pay wages comparable to large
firms, they often do not have the capital or the capacity to automate at home
or relocate production overseas.  Thus, the combination of a near empty
reservoir of flexible domestic workers, a still-significant small-scale
manufacturing sector, and constraints on the firms' flexibility combine to
create a demand for foreign workers.  In Tokyo in 1990, a survey found that 11
percent of all small manufacturing firms employed some foreign workers.<p>
<p>
Japan is in the midst of its second period of labor shortage.  In the
first--from 1965 to 1973--labor shortages were met through rural-urban
migration, automation, and investment overseas, and wage differentials between
large and small manufacturing firms narrowed.  During the second period of
labor shortages between 1986 and 1991, small manufacturing firms that had
already closed the wage gap with large firms, and could not longer find
ex-farmers to fill the 3-D jobs they offered, began to turn increasingly to
sidedoor and backdoor foreign workers.<p>
<p>
There are estimated to be 1.2 million foreign workers in Japan, including
400,000 illegal workers.  The type of foreign worker employed tends to vary
with firm size.  The largest firms tend to favor legal immigrants, such as
ethnic Japanese Nikkei from Brazil and Peru.  Mid-sized firms often look to
trainees--foreigners who mostly work and sometimes learn in Japan.  The
smallest firms--often subcontractors with fewer than 10 workers--are most apt
to employ illegal alien workers.  There seem to be few alternatives, in the
view of some, to importing foreign workers during today's labor shortages to
preserve the small firms that give Japan's manufacturing sector its
flexibility.<p>
<p>
Taiwan and Malaysia represent interesting cases in which managing migration is
a challenge produced by rapid economic growth--in other words, most countries
would much prefer to enjoy economic success and have to manage migration than
to stagnate and not worry about illegal immigration.  In Taiwan, export-led
manufacturing growth has improved conditions for the average worker, a clear
case of the Asian miracle, but left in its wake labor shortages that are being
filled by migrant workers, especially in construction and as household
maids.<sup> </sup> In mid-1994, there were almost 200,000 foreign workers in
Taiwan, making foreigners two percent of the country's workforce.<p>
<p>
Malaysia is the first Muslim country to industrialize, and the demand for
foreign workers there reflects both rapid economic growth and the slowness of
some economic sectors to restructure.  The Malaysian migrant worker dilemma
illustrates the challenge facing many fast-growing Asian nations.  As these
economies grow rapidly, productivity increases and wage growth vary by sector.
Manufacturing tends to generate the fastest growth in output and wages per
worker, and so the workforce--especially young women with some secondary
education-- "naturally" redistributes itself toward manufacturing. <p>
Manufacturing miracles may lead to labor shortages in agriculture and
construction, unless employers there raise wages.  But the wage increases
necessary to balance labor supply and demand in such traditional sectors may be
so high that commodity production may shrink, or the costs of
government-financed construction projects rise, so there is pressure to admit
"temporary" foreign workers--in Malaysia's case foreign workers are believed to
be at least one-third of the hired workers in agriculture, and two-thirds of
the workers employed in construction.<p>
<p>
Thailand represents a confused case of segmentation that permitted the
best-educated urban residents to reap many of the benefits of export-led
manufacturing growth.  Because manufacturing jobs are prized, and rural wages
are very low, Thai employers--unlike their counterparts in Malaysia-- can and
do demand that the young women they employ have more than a primary school
education, even if the jobs they fill do not seem to require this much
education.  Since 80 percent of all Thai workers have only a primary school
education, most are locked out of manufacturing jobs.  Labor-intensive
manufacturing growth in Thailand seems to be a case of concentrated benefits,
so that the distribution of income has become more unequal despite rapid
growth.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Conclusions</i><p>
<i></i>Asia presents the world with examples of rapid economic development,
simultaneous economic and employment growth, and ever-increasing international
labor flows.  The "Asian model" of export-led manufacturing growth is seen by
some as a beacon for developing countries elsewhere--if they adopt the Asian
model, they too, the reasoning goes, could expect average incomes to double
within a decade.<p>
<p>
It is hard to argue with success, but some participants felt that the Asian
model is not universally applicable.  Even within Asia, there are cases of
development failures as well as successes.  However, the Asian successes do
seem to argue for economic democracy--for spreading, first via jobs and later
rising wages, the benefits of one sector's growth throughout the economy and
labor force.<p>
The migration management lessons from Asia are less clear, largely because
there are not yet any generally recognized success stories.  Instead, Asian
countries so far seem to be making the same mistakes that were made earlier in
North America and Europe--opening sectors selectively to foreign workers, and
changing migrant worker policies frequently as the relative power of domestic
"let them in" and "keep them out" camps ebbs and flows.<p>
<p>
The Asian economic miracle has been recognized.  Asian migration remains an
unfinished story, with few clairvoyants willing to predict how it will
ultimately turn out.<p>

Migration Journal, available from Scalabrini Migration Center, PO Box 10541,

<p>
Under the proposed Recruitment of Foreign Workers Act, employers could be fined
up to RM 50,000 for each illegal worker employed, imprisoned for five years, or
both.  Currently, the Human Resources Ministry has no power to sanction
employers who hire illegal immigrant workers;  when the Labor Department learns
of illegal workers, they are referred to the Immigration Department.  <p>
<p>
There are an estimated to be over 1 million illegal immigrants in Malaysia,
including 800,000 Indonesians, 100,000 Filipinos, and 100,000 Bangladeshis.
Between July 1992 and June 1994, 104,920 illegals were apprehended in Malaysia.
Most are housed in one of eight detention centers--at a cost estimated at
RM500,000 (US$200,000) monthly--and eventually deported.  <p>
<p>
One company has proposed handling, for a fee, all aspects of the recruitment of
foreign workers, replacing the 822 licensed recruitment companies--300 of which
are currently active.  Some in government think that a single employment agency
would reduce illegal immigration by fraudulent employment agencies.<p>
<p>
A senior plantation leader lamented the alleged labor shortages on Malaysian
plantations, and argued that increasing their dependence on foreign workers
cannot solve the industry's problems because "foreign workers do not have the
dedication or the discipline."  Instead, he complained that plantations are
being used only as an entry point for foreign workers who want to enter
Malaysia's booming manufacturing sector.  <p>
<p>
However, the rubber manufacturers' association acknowledged that 25 percent of
its unskilled workers are foreigners, and 11 percent of its skilled workers,
and asked the government to clarify its foreign workers policy for factories.

<a name="RTFToC21">Domestic
Workers in Hong Kong</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are almost 130,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, a sharp
increase from the 24,600 of 10 years ago.  Most are Filipinos--they are
preferred because they speak English--the others come from Indonesia, Thailand
and Sri Lanka.  <p>
<p>
There are many complaints of physical and sexual abuse.  Five organizations
have combined to form the Coalition to Combat Violence Against Migrant Workers,
to demand protections for migrants and government investigations of abuse
against migrant workers.  The coalition has also called for employment agencies
to be blacklisted if they send maids to employers known to be abusive.<p>
<p>
Residents of Hong Kong depend upon domestic workers for cleaning and child
care.  Domestic workers are vulnerable because, if they leave their employer,
they have only two weeks to find another employer and sign a contract or face
deportation.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong is planning to import another 3,300 workers to work in retail stores
and restaurants.  There are 11,000 workers approved for 28 types of industries;
most have two-year contracts.  However, 10,177 employers have filed
applications requesting permission to import a total of 100,490 workers.  <p>
<p>
Unions have protested plans to increase in the number of foreign workers,
arguing that displaced manufacturing workers would be unable to find service
jobs because of the foreign workers. <p>
<p>
The Hong Kong government has proposes that foreign workers and their employers
each contribute into a pension fund, even though few foreign workers are
expected to qualify for benefits.<p>

Foreign Workers in Korea</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On late July, the South Korean government announced that an additional 15,000
to 20,000 foreign workers could be employed in labor-short textile and footwear
factories by the end of 1994.  The first 20,000 foreign workers to be employed
under the current short-term vocational training program are expected to arrive
by September, 1994.  There are reported to be 140,000 foreign workers currently
in Korea, including an estimated 52,000 illegal alien workers.<p>
<p>
Thailand has protested the low wages offered to the foreign worker trainees in
Korea--$300 monthly plus room and board.  The Overseas Employment
Administration Office in Thailand announced that they will delay sending 300
workers to South Korea for the training program until the wage issue has been
resolved. <p>
<p>
The Korean government introduced a bill that would extend the health protection
plan available for low-income Koreans to foreign workers.  Six hospitals have
announced that they will set aside beds for foreign workers.  Foreign workers
will also be allowed to live in certain apartments for a rent of 9800 won ($12)
monthly.<p>

<a name="RTFToC23">No
Foreign Workers in Singapore Retail</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Singapore Labour Ministry has rejected a request by retailers to allow
foreign workers to fill service jobs.  The ministry said that allowing foreign
workers to be clerks would lead to more non-traditional source (NTS) workers in
the manufacturing and hotel industries.  A similar request by the Singapore
Retailers Association was rejected last year. <p>
<p>
A Labour Ministry spokesperson said that a rise in NTS workers would increase
social problems and suppress the wages of Singaporeans in these sectors.
Retailers claim they face a shortage of around 4,000 workers.  Firms in the
service sector are only allowed to employ foreign workers from Malaysia, but
they are not allowed to exceed 20 percent of the firm's total workforce.
Foreigners from non-traditional sources are only allowed to work in industries
such as construction, marine industries, and as domestic workers. <p>
<p>
Dr. Tilak Abeysinghe of the National University of Singapore said the wage gap
between department managers and blue-collar workers, which is higher in
Singapore than in 10 other major Asian cities, may be caused by the country's
high proportion of foreign workers.  According to a 1991 Union Bank of
Switzerland study, a Singaporean department manager earned nine times more than
a construction worker, eight times more than a female textile workers and five
times more than a bus driver.  <p>
<p>
In Hong Kong, a department manager earned four times more than a construction
worker, four times more than a female construction worker and three times more
than a bus driver.  Hong Kong rated second to Singapore in the wage gap.
Dependence upon foreign workers will continue, according to Abeysinghe, because
Singaporean workers are upgrading their skills, leaving low-skilled tasks to
foreign workers.  Skilled non-professional workers are continuing to emigrate
to Australia and Canada, leaving another gap to be filled by foreign workers.

<a name="RTFToC24">Cambodian
Immigration Law Under Consideration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A law which would provide for the deportation and expulsion of aliens is
currently being considered by the National Assembly in Phnom Penh.  The law
allows the Interior Ministry to confiscate the papers of resident aliens,
making it possible to expel them without the right to a hearing by a court. <p>
<p>
Human rights organizations worry that should the law pass, it could lead to a
repeat of human rights violations that occurred under the Lon Nol and Pol Pot
governments.  The human rights organization, Asia Watch, said that the ethnic
Vietnamese residents of Cambodia are the targets of the law, which does not
include a definition of nationality.  Asia Watch reports that the Interior
Ministry has already taken some steps, including ordering reports on non-Khmer
inhabitants and confiscating Cambodian identity documents from non-Khmer
speaking people trying to enter the country, which they think indicates plans
to expel the ethnic Vietnamese.  There are claims by the Khmer that as many as
four million Vietnamese are living in Cambodia. <p>

Immigration To and Through Thailand</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Thai police bureau commissioner reports that approximately 500,000 illegal
aliens currently live in Thailand.  Most are believed to be Burmese employed in
fishing and agriculture.  Rising Thai rubber production has led to an increase
in illegal Burmese workers in Thailand.  Employment Department Director-General
Sinchai Riantrakul said 21,500 illegal aliens were arrested in Thailand in 1992
and 12,000 in 1993, while 750<i> </i>have already been arrested in the first
six months of this year.<p>
<p>
There are estimated to be 100,000 Indians living in Bangkok, including 20,000
to 30,000 from Gorakpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh.  Most are traders, or take
jobs that Thais shun, and most earn Baht 3,000 to 4,000 ($120 to $160) monthly.
Most do not have work visas, so they travel to Laos every few months to renew
tourist visas.<p>
 <p>
US immigration officials are working with their Thai counterparts to crack down
on foreigners using Thailand as a jumping off point for illegal entry to the
US.  US immigration authorities report that Chinese nationals are traveling to

of the Chinese are members of gangs.  Some operate forgery rings which produce
fake passports for Chinese immigrants.<p>

Refugees and UNHCR</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The number of refugees worldwide has more than doubled over the past 10 years,
from 10.5 million in 1984 to 23 million in 1994.  In addition, there are an
estimated 26 million people displaced from their homes inside their countries
of citizenship.<p>
<p>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established in 1951--for
three years-- to help those fleeing Communist regimes.  It continues to be
renewed every five years, and raises its $1.3 billion annual budget by
appealing to governments for help with specific refugee situations.  <p>
<p>
With the end of the Cold War, the agency's job has grown rather than shrunk.
As millions of people flee across borders--like the two million who have fled
Rwanda over the past two months--UNHCR and other relief agencies rush in to
provide humanitarian relief, and then slowly refugees are resettled or returned
to their homes.  <p>
<p>
Today the conflicts that produce refugees are less controllable by the world's
major powers.  In some conflicts, ethnic and religious groups are attacked in
order to cause mass panic and flight and "ethnically cleanse" an area.  In
countries such as Somalia, there is no central government power, and competing
warlords sometimes use food as a weapon against civilians in rebel areas.  <p>

Global Migration:  People on the Move is a wall map available from Population
Action International, 1120-19th St NW, Washington DC, 20036, that uses arrows
of various thicknesses to illustrate migration flows between 1980 and 1989.
The map illustrates only legal migration, and this explains why there are only
two flows pictured that involved more than 200,000 migrants annually--Latin
America and southeast Asia to the United States.   <p>
<p>
The text that accompanies the map provides brief summaries of the economic and
non-economic factors that explain why migration occurs, the economic impacts of
migration, and the prospects for future flows.  Charts illustrate widening gap
in per capita incomes between the richest and poorest countries, and the fact
that the industrial countries workforce is expected to stabilize at its current
level of 500 million, while the developing countries' labor force is expected
to grow from 2 billion today to 2.5 billion in 1010.<p>
<p>
The Spring 1994 issue of the Urban Age, Vol 2, No 3, includes 10 short articles
devoted to international migration and cities.  The overview by Stephen Castles
and Mark Miller notes that international migration is a consequence but not a
solution to the North-South gap, and that there are four global trends--the
tendency of all industrial nations to become immigration destinations; larger
numbers of migrants; different streams; and more women flowing across borders.

St, New York, NY 10021. 1-800-275-1447.<p>
<p>
This three-part book explains that the US was a country of mass immigration at
the beginning of the 20th century, and is once again receiving 1 million
immigrants annually at the end of the 20th century.  According to the Twentieth
Century Fund's President, "Suro's central message is that the real challenge of
immigration is not control of entry but rather what to do about the immigrants
who succeed in reaching the United States."(pvi).<p>
<p>
In 13 short chapters, Suro notes that immigration is the visible face of social
change, and that the US played an important role in  initiating role today's
mass immigration.  Most of the chapters emphasize the similarities and
differences between the immigration of Latinos today and the immigration of the
English, Irish, and other groups in the past.  Suro focuses on the second
generation, asserting that their prospects for success are the key to whether
today's immigration will be considered by future generations to have been an
investment in growth or decline.<p>
<p>
In order to assure the success of today's immigrants, Suro calls for a new
integration policy--a "contract between the receiving nations and the
newcomers." (p106).  Traditionally, immigrants fulfill a US need, and have a
built-in support system in the form of family and friends.  But illegal aliens,
refugees and asylum-seekers, and the minority status of many newcomers has
challenged traditional integration assumptions.  <p>
<p>
Suro notes that, in some cases, membership in US civic society seems so have
shifted from President Kennedy's "Ask not" to today's "ask what I am entitled
to" and, while he does not necessarily oppose restricting the right of some
newcomers to some public services, he thinks that any such restrictions should
apply only to future immigrants, not to those who already here.  Furthermore,
Suro argues that such restrictions are doomed to fail, since "no nation can
conduct large-scale immigration successfully based on degrees of
exclusions."(p112). <p>
<p>
Suro ends by arguing that border and interior immigration controls are bound to
fail, and that the best hope to deal with unwanted immigration is to make "a
determined assault of jobs that fail to meet the standards of decent
employment."(p113).  However, he does not explain how "indecent" jobs will be
eliminated by the market or enforcement of labor laws if large numbers of
immigrants continue to arrive.  <p>
<p>
The Summer 1994 issue of the National Forum--the Phi Kappa Phi Journal-- Vol
74, No 3, includes 8 short articles devoted to immigration and the changing
face of America.  Doris Meissner, INS Commissioner, repeated her goals--to
improve INS professionalism, to achieve control with compassion, and to have
the INS be the leader in making immigration policy.  Meissner said that the US
is a nation of immigrants and should remain one.<p>
<p>
Susan Martin, Executive Director of the Commission on Immigration Reform,
discusses the need to take historical and future concerns into account when
considering immigration policies for the 21st century, and to balance competing
interests in formulating an immigration policy.  Demetriou Papademtrios repeats
an earlier article that concludes that there is no definitive analysis of the
effects of immigrants on the US economy and labor market.<p>
<p>
Philip Martin discusses the endless debate over US agriculture's need for
foreign workers, noting that the farm labor market continues to serve as one of
the easiest ports of entry for Latinos into the US labor market.  Sidney
Weintraub reviews the arguments over the likely effects of NAFTA on migration
to the US, notes that NAFTA alone will not reduce unwanted Mexican immigration,
but pleads that the US avoid taking drastic steps to curb illegal immigration
that might interfere with NAFTA-inspired closer economic ties.<p>
<p>
Terresa Sullivan argues that women, who are over half of all immigrants, are
wrongly ignored because they are seen as tied to the men who initiate
migration.  If some family unification visas were shifted to employment visas,
she thinks that more educated women may immigrate--30 percent of all female
doctors in the US are foreign -born.  Richard Schauffler notes that old modes
of assimilation and integration may not have been appropriate for their time,
and may not be appropriate for today's immigrants.<p>

Cassen, Robert.  Ed.  1994.  Population and Development:  Old Debates, New
Conclusions.  Washington, DC:  Overseas Development Council.<p>
<p>
This book presents nine perspectives on the question of how population growth
affects development.  Cassen notes that the industrial and developing nations
have changed their perspectives on the relationship between population and
development--in 1974, the industrial countries urged developing nations to
adopt policies to slow population growth, and India and China countered that
limiting population growth was not necessary.  By 1984, developing nations such
as India and China changed their positions to favor efforts to restrict
population growth, but so did the US, which argued against abortion and family
planning programs.  As the world prepares to meet in Cairo in September 1994,
the US is once again backing efforts to give women reproductive rights, but
this time the Vatican and some Islamic countries are arguing that population
programs are not necessary or wrong.<p>
<p>
In a very qualified conclusion, Cassen says that most researchers agree that
rapid population growth in poor countries makes it harder to achieve rapid
development.  He notes that the evidence for the negative effects of rapid
population growth is most apparent at the individual and household levels.
Furthermore, even cash-strapped finance ministers in developing nations can
fairly quickly recoup in lower education and health budgets the costs of family
planning programs.<p>
<p>
Chapter 8 by Teitelbaum and Russell deals with migration and development.  They
note that there were an estimated 100 million international migrants of all
types in the mid-1980s, and that there number is higher today.  If combined
into a single country, this "nation of migrants" would be the world's tenth
largest nation.<p>
<p>
Second, they conclude that it is very hard to generalize about the "complex and
indirect" relationship between fertility, migration, and development--many
emigration nations see exporting labor as a source of jobs and remittances,
while many immigration countries are alarmed by migrant unemployment and the
possibility of an ethnic underclass.  Third, they emphasize that the surest
long-run solution for emigration pressures--sustained economic growth--can have
the seemingly perverse effect of increasing emigration in the short to medium
term.<p>
<p>
This chapter also notes that most international migrants move from one high
fertility developing country to another--i.e., between countries with similar
population structures--but 40 to 45 percent of the migrants move from high
fertility developing to low fertility industrial nations.  But the facts do not
suggest that international migration is smoothing population differentials.
Economic gaps between industrial and developing nations widened in the 1980s,
but emigration pressures were often strongest in some of the fastest growing
nations, such as China and Mexico.  Remittance flows from migrants abroad to
families at home total over $71 billion annually, and over $31 billion from
industrial to developing countries, or equivalent to almost two-thirds of the
official aid provided to accelerate development.<p>

Immigration and the Environment.  Available for $18 from Sierra Club Books, 730
Polk St, San Francisco, CA 94109.  <p>
<p>
This five-chapter book is based on the assumption that population growth
exacerbates problems, and that immigration is a major reason for US population
growth.  Unless population growth is slowed, which would require less
immigration, the authors assert, the US will pose a threat to the world
ecosystem.  <p>
<p>
The usual formula for discussing the effects of population on the environment
is Impact=People x their Consumption x Technology--which means that the total
environmental impact of is the impact of each person times the number of
people.  But this formulation makes the effects of population ambiguous--both
population growth and higher incomes (consumption) can have environmental
impacts.  Most economists argue that the environmental impacts of population
growth are greatest in situations where there are too few markets to generate
prices and incentives to treat common resources as scarce commodities.  For
example, if no one "owns" the fishery or the forest, poor families may have
incentives to have additional children so they can capture a bigger share of
the fish or wood for themselves.<p>
<p>
The book takes a macro view in discussing the current impact of people,
consumption, and technology on five areas: cities, energy, forests,
agriculture, and biodiveristy--and finds that severe problems will in each case
be aggravated by population growth.  Next is a discussion of the determinants
of population growth, and a review of the probable effects of a larger
population on cities, energy, forests, agriculture, and biodiveristy.  <p>
<p>
Bouvier and Grant review alternative demographic futures, and emphasize that
the population growth "juggernaut" will be very hard to slow down.  But they
argue that, if it is slowed, everything from the cities to the forests will
benefit.  The book ends with a call to arms, a plea for readers to get involved
with in shaping the future population of the US.<p>

US Department of Labor and INS.  1994.  An Evaluation of the Pilot Program of
Off-Campus Work Authorization for Foreign Students (F-1 Non-immigrants).
August 10. <p>
<p>
The 1990 IMMACT included a three-year program under which employers in college
towns could attest to DOL that they had tried to recruit for a vacant job for
at least 60 days, and that they were offering at least the prevailing wage, and
then, to fill the job, employers could hire foreign students for up to 20 hours
weekly during the school year, and full time in summer.  An estimated 5,000
foreign students participated in the program in FY 1991-92, a small fraction of
the over 400,000 foreign students in the US.<p>
<p>
The pilot program was supposed to be employer driven--employers would seek
foreign students after their unfilled jobs persisted at least 60 days.  But in
practice, foreign students contacted employers, and in some cases offered to
work for lower wages--or make some other concession-- that may violate employer
assertions in the attestation but that would be hard to detect.  And once
foreign students got hired, there was some evidence that their network would
take over supplying workers to these low-wage employers, so that American
workers no longer seek or obtain such jobs.  There was evidence of such network
hiring in software firms in or near some college towns.<p>
<p>
The report noted that F-1 students are required to sign an affidavit asserting
that they have the resources to support themselves while studying in the US.
There are nonetheless other options for foreign students to obtain US
employment, including on-campus employment upon their arrival, off-campus work
authorization in the event of serious economic hardship, and work/study
programs that are part of the student's educational program.<p>
