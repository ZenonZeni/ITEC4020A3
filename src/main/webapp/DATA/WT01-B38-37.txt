<h1>Tell Children the Truth About Drinking</h1>

<p> Los Angeles Times OP-ED March 1, 1996 </p>

<p> Alcohol: It can be good for you. If we stressed moderation
over </p>

<p> abstinence, we'd have fewer problem drinkers, young or old. </p>

<p> By STANTON PEELE </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"><br>
</p>

<p> After years of debate, the U.S. government has finally
decided that alcohol can be beneficial. Federal dietary
recommendations, revised every five years, now indicate that
moderate drinking lowers the risk of heart disease. The dietary
guidelines note that such &quot;beverages have been used to
enhance the enjoyment of meals throughout human history. </p>

<p> There is both old and new information in this statement. We
all know that many Americans drink only occasionally or lightly
at meals and social occasions. They know when to quit, don't
misbehave when they drink and enjoy the taste and sensations of
alcohol without going overboard. </p>

<p> Most of us are also aware that people in different cultures
handle alcohol differently. In Mediterranean societies -- Italy,
Spain, Portugal -- alcohol is consumed in the form of wine,
usually at meals, by family members of all ages. Even small
children are served wine on special occasion&amp; Many European
countries permit adolescents to drink with their families at
restaurants. </p>

<p> To many Americans, the idea of offering children alcohol is
reprehensible. Yet, this approach to drinking seems to inoculate
children against alcohol abuse later in life. A study conducted
by Harvard psychiatrist George Vaillant followed a group of men
in Boston for more than four decades. The Italian, Greek and
Jewish men were only one-seventh as likely as Irish Americans in
the study to become alcoholic. </p>

<p> In contemporary America, we are taught that alcoholics are
born, not made. Yet no gene determines that any individual will
become an alcoholic. Rather, development of adult alcoholism is a
long-term, interactive process. Despite our claim to advanced
medical knowledge about alcoholism, America produces many more
problem drinkers than do many traditional cultures. </p>

<p> The groups in the Vaillant study that had few alcoholics
actually teach children responsible drinking at home. The problem
with a blanket disapproval of drinking is that many children
develop drinking habits on their own that are very different from
sipping wine at a religious feast or family meal. National
surveys show that up to half of college students and high school
seniors have drunk five or more drinks at one sitting in the
prior two weeks. Among fraternity and sorority members, this
figure is 80%. </p>

<p> Ironically, in the United States today, we follow the method
of alcohol education found least successful in the Vaillant
study. That is, alcohol is grouped with illicit drugs, and
children are taught that abstinence is the only answer. Yet
children are aware that most adults drink, and many drink alcohol
themselves on the sly. Moreover, drinking will be legal and
widely available to them within a few short years. Clearly, many
young people find the abstinence message confusing and
hypocritical. </p>

<p> Studies that examine health outcomes among groups of adults
who have been tracked for years find that moderate drinkers live
longer than abstainers. What is moderate drinking? The government
defined this as no more than two drinks daily for men and one for
women. Britain has defined higher sensible drinking limits-two to
three drinks for women and three to four for men. </p>

<p> These standards apply to adult men and post-menopausal women,
or to any adult with one or more coronary risk factors (such as
having a parent with premature heart disease, being overweight,
having high cholesterol or blood pressure). Three-quarters of all
Americans have such risk factors. These adults show significant
reduction in mortality when they drink moderately. </p>

<p> The lower death rate among moderate drinkers is due to the
reduction in heart disease, specifically atherosclerosis or
clogging of the arteries. Alcohol enhances high density-or
good-cholesterol production. However, when people average more
than two drinks daily, they are more likely to suffer from such
diseases as cancer and cirrhosis. At five to six drinks daily for
men and four drinks for women, these risks distinctly outweigh
the benefits of drinking. </p>

<p> What are people to make of these complications in the message
about alcohol? Like most things in life, sound judgment and
moderation are the bywords. After all, there are many things
people consume occasionally -- such as meat, desserts or cigars
-- that if done to excess become health problems. Even
adolescents can define the difference between healthy and
unhealthy drinking. I recommend holding such open discussions
among teenagers in place of the standard temperance lecture that
passes for alcohol education. After all, even the government
confirms that all drinking is not bad. </p>
