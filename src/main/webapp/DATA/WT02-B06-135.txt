<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy: Overview/Executive Summary</title>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Internet and other interactive services are a new medium, and a 
new array of markets, different from any means of communication that has 
come before.  This new medium raises fundamental questions about the 
appropriate balance between the needs of the market, of American families, 
and basic constitutional free speech and privacy guarantees that Americans 
value so deeply.  In order to protect families and children in this open, global 
network, we should first rely on the entrepreneurial spirit of the interactive 
services market to build parental empowerment tools, and encourage the 
industry to work together to ensure that such solutions are widely available.  
The interactive media market must not be regulated like telegraphs, broadcast 
radio and television, and telephones, thereby stifling the development of an 
important new communications medium with burdensome regulations.  
Rather, we should identify policies that enable the interactive media market 
to flourish like the personal computer industry, and provide parents the 
ability to protect their children from inappropriate material that is 
internationally-available.
<p>
In answer to questions posed to the Interactive Working Group by 
Senator Patrick Leahy earlier this year, this report contains an assessment of:
<p><ol>
<li>general policy issues at stake in the regulation of content on the 
National Information Infrastructure;
<p>
<li>software and services available today that enable parents to 
restrict their children from access to inappropriate material 
online;
<p>
<li>the current state of criminal law regarding obscenity, child 
pornography, and harassment online;
<p>
<li>threats to free speech, free press and individual privacy raised by 
proposed regulation of indecency in interactive media.
</ol><p>
We begin with a brief overview of the contents of the report:
<p>
<p>
<h3>A.	A New Regulatory Model for Interactive Media is needed to 
Ensure Free Speech and Continued Innovation in the National 
and International Information Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
The Internet is a global information and communications system 
which is becoming a critical resource for organizations and individuals 
around the world.  Businesses, schools, libraries, researchers, community 
groups, and individuals are all coming to rely on the Internet as a vital 
communications system and information resource.  The Internet and other 
interactive media include electronic mail, the World Wide Web, online 
discussion groups, and other multimedia information resources.  Providers 
of interactive media services range from large and small online services and 
bulletin boards, to those who provide services for their own use such as 
schools, libraries, and large and small businesses.
<p>
To ensure the continued growth of the new interactive media market, 
national policy for the Internet must:
<p><ol>
<li>preserve the vibrant free market in interactive media, free from 
regulation of constitutionally-protected communications and 
information;
<p>
<li>preserve full constitutional free speech and privacy protections 
in new interactive media;
<p>
<li>encourage the industry to work together to develop blocking and 
filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their 
children's access to offensive material;
<p>
<li>ensure emerging media not be used for criminal activity such as 
stalking, trafficking in obscenity, and the creation of child 
pornography.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>B.	Currently Available Blocking and Filtering Technology, 
combined with public education, can empower parents to protect 
their children from inappropriate material online</h3>
<p>
While the vast majority of content on the Internet is intended for 
legitimate educational, cultural, political, or entertainment value.  Some 
material on the Internet, however, may not be appropriate for children. 
Moreover, much of this material is accessible from the United States but 
transmitted from other countries, beyond the practical reach of U.S. law.  In 
order to protect children we must rely on powerful new blocking and filtering 
technology to empower parents to make choices about the material which 
their children can access.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Entrepreneurial effort has already produced blocking and 
filtering products for families and schools:</b>  The inherent power 
of computer software allows the creation of computer programs 
which enable parents to block material from the reach of their 
children automatically, without the need for constant parental 
supervision.  Such software can be easily installed by parents, 
even those who are not computer experts.
<p>
<li><b>The global and decentralized nature of interactive media 
requires new approaches to child protection: </b> Censorship of 
centralized media such as radio and television may be effective 
at keeping the "seven dirty words" off the airwaves.  However, 
on the Internet, with tens of millions of content creators all over 
the world, US law, no matter how tough, will never be able to 
keep offensive material out of the reach of kids.
<p>
<li><b>Industry-wide initiatives are developing standard label and 
blocking conventions to increase the effectiveness of blocking:</b>  
The flexibility of interactive media allows multiple rating 
systems to co-exist so that individuals and families can chose a 
rating system that best reflects their own values.  No single 
government-mandated system could be as comprehensive or 
flexible as voluntary private sector alternatives.
<p>
<li><b>Individual and parental choice assures full respect for the free 
speech rights in interactive media:</b>  Relying on individuals and 
parents, not the government, to make choices about the content 
that they and their families receive assures maximum respect for 
First Amendment rights of adults to receive and transmit 
constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not 
federal bureaucrats, to determine what information is most 
consistent with their own moral values.
</ul><p>
Any changes in federal law should seek to remove the Hobson's choice faced 
by all who provide access to the Internet.  In order to protect children, legal 
disincentives facing those who would create 'child safe' areas should be 
removed.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Recent case law discourages online providers from screening 
material that is inappropriate for children:</b>  In the recent Stratton 
Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Company, No. 31063/94 (N.Y. 
Sup. Ct. May 24, 1995) case, Prodigy was found to be a "publisher" 
of libelous statements made by a subscriber on one of its online 
bulletin boards.  Such added exposure to legal liability is a 
substantial disincentive to the creation of 'child safe' interactive 
services.
<p>
<li><b>Neither federal nor state law should punish service providers 
for creating child-safe services.</b>  The marketplace should be free 
to create a variety of online forums, some that provide only 
material appropriate for children, and others that are more open 
and designed for a wider audience. 
</ul><p>
<h3>C.	There is No Anarchy in Interactive Media:  Vigorous 
enforcement of current criminal laws will protect all users from 
obscenity, child pornography, and harassment online</h3>
<p>
Law enforcement agencies and some prominent pro-family groups 
agree current laws already enable prosecutions of online obscenity violations.  
More vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws may, however, be 
necessary.  Following this logic, it is unnecessary to amend federal law to 
prohibit distribution of obscenity by computer, since existing law already 
criminalizes such conduct, as well as threats and harassment by computer.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The Department of Justice and American Family Association 
state that existing laws already criminalize obscenity online.</b>
<p>
<li><b>Tough obscenity, child pornography and harassment laws are 
already in the federal criminal code:</b>  Under existing Federal law 
trafficking in <b>obscenity</b> (18 U.S.C. ¤¤1462, 1464, 1466), <b>child 
pornography</b> (18 U.S.C. ¤2252), <b>harassment</b> (18 U.S.C. ¤875(c)), 
<b>illegal solicitation or luring of minors </b>(18 U.S.C. ¤2423(b)), and 
<b>threatening to injure someone</b> (18 U.S.C. ¤875(c)) have already 
been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer 
networks.
<p>
<li><b>Online obscenity and child pornography crimes are being 
prosecuted around the country:</b>  These laws are being enforced, 
as is evident by numerous prosecutions around the country.
<p>
<li><b>The Senate-passed legislative proposals fail to add any 
protections against online stalking and child solicitation:</b>  
Everyone is concerned about protecting children from threats 
online and off.  Ironically, the Senate-passed Communications 
Decency Amendment only punishes indecency and obscenity, 
not stalking or solicitation.  Neither prosecutors nor police 
receive any additional help in the prevention or prosecution of 
online crimes against children.
</ul><p>
<h3>D.	Bans on indecent communications online are 
unconstitutional</h3>
<p>
The unique nature of interactive media demands that policy makers 
carefully evaluate the application of the First Amendment in a new light.  
Essential to the Court's approval of indecency restrictions in the broadcast 
media was the fact that listeners had insufficient control over programming 
to which they were exposed.  Any effort to impose similar indecency 
restrictions on interactive media, however, will not pass constitutional 
scrutiny given the high degree of user control in this new medium.
<p><ul>
<li><b>To assure the First Amendment free flow of information and 
protect individual privacy rights, liability for online service 
providers must be carefully limited:</b>  If online system and service 
providers are held criminally liable for obscene or indecent 
material created by their users, and not intentionally purveyed 
by the provider, then public service providers and private 
system operators will be forced to become private censors in 
order to limit their own legal risk.  Just as current law limits the 
liability of phone companies, mail services, and other carriers for 
the content of material which the carrier merely transports, 
online service provider liability should be limited in order to 
assure the free flow of information on the National Information 
Infrastructure.  
<p>
<li><b>Ability of users and parents to control the material to which they 
have access places constitutional limits on the degree to which 
the government can censor material based on its content:</b>  The 
First Amendment has been interpreted to allow restrictions on 
indecent speech only if such government restrictions are the 
"least restrictive means" of protecting children or accomplishing 
other important government goals.  Given that parents are able 
to protect their children from unwanted material using 
screening tools, government restrictions are unnecessary and 
therefore unconstitutional.
<p>
<li><b>Online service providers should not be forced to become private 
censors:</b>  If online services or individual system operators are 
held liable for all of their users' communications, the services 
will be forced to impose stringent censorship rules on their users 
in order to limit the corporate liability of the service provider.  
Such rules would create a chilling effect on users of interactive 
media.
<p>
<li><b>There are great constitutional difficulties in defining 
"indecency":</b>  Neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court have 
ever established a single definition for what constitutes 
"indecent" material.  The FCC has offered different definitions 
for indecency depending on the communications medium.  
Embarking on such a process for interactive media would be 
fraught with Constitutional disputes and challenges in court.  
Efforts to ban indecency on dial-a-porn services lead to ten years 
of constitutional litigation, thus delaying the enforcement of 
those regulations considerably.
<p>
<li><b>The Federal Communications Commission should not be given 
power to regulate content in interactive media:</b>  The inherent 
complexity and constitutional difficulties of regulating indecency 
would involve the FCC in lengthy and burdensome rulemaking 
to implement any indecency ban.  Such extension of FCC control 
over new media will create unnecessary bureaucratic intrusions 
that hinder the development of new interactive media and 
private sector screening options.
