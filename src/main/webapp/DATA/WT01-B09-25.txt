<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Mexico City — Penn Octane Corp. is expected to convert up to 1,000 of Mexico City’s taxis to compressed natural gas (CNG) as part of a wide-ranging agreement reached with private owners of public transportation companies there. It’s part of a package deal between four entities that includes a $90 million, 1,500-bus purchase through Penn Octane’s recently acquired bus dealership (News Notes 1/18/97), the taxi conversions, and CNG refueling stations to be owned and operated by Penn Octane. Taxi operator Sistema De Transportes En Taxis, S.A. de C.V. will also commit to long-term fuel purchases from Houston, Texas-based Penn Octane. About 70 percent of Mexico City’s air pollution – the world’s worst – comes from vehicles (News Notes 1/25/96, 3/14/96, 10/18/96 and 11/7/96). Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) produce 90 percent fewer emissions than conventional vehicles.
