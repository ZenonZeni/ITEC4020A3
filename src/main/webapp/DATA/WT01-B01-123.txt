<h3>Homophobic Attacks on the Press</h3>
by Masha Gessen<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Political or ethnic discrimination and a desire to suppress coverage of corruption 
and human rights violations are well-documented motives for attacks on journalists 
around the world. An often undocumented motive, though increasingly common, is homophobia. Gay and lesbian journalists are frequently physically attacked or slapped with lawsuits 
for reporting news of concern to the gay and lesbian communities.<BR>
</CITE>
<CITE><BR>
</CITE>
<CITE>That was one of the major findings of a CPJ report documenting attacks against gay 
and lesbian journalists between 1990 and 1995 in countries as politically and culturally 
disparate as Canada, Russia and Zimbabwe. These press freedom violations have rarely been reported, and CPJ undertook the project to draw attention to the problem. As 
with all of the cases CPJ reports on, the attacks were a direct consequence of a 
journalist's or news organization's work. <BR>
</CITE>
<CITE><BR>
</CITE>
<CITE>Following is an excerpt from that report. To obtain a copy of the complete report, 
please contact CPJ.</CITE>
<BR>
<BR>
There is almost no place in the world where journalism is a safe profession. And nowhere in the world is it 
safe to be homosexual. Gay and lesbian journalists, because of their visibility, 
are easy targets for much of the abuse directed toward the gay and lesbian communities.<BR>
<BR>
Homophobia pervades all layers of society, and those who seek to silence journalists 
or news outlets that cover gay and lesbian issues range from heads of state to criminal 
extortionists. The weapons they use may differ: Attacks by authorities are most likely to involve censorship laws and other measures of legal restraint, whereas attacks 
by nongovernmental forces are more likely to take the form of physical abuse, though 
at times police have resorted to similar brute tactics. But the result of their efforts are the same: a chilling effect on coverage of gay and lesbian issues and on 
the distribution of gay and lesbian publications.<BR>
<BR>
No matter the transgressor or the act, however, law enforcement agents, journalists 
and human rights groups have often failed to recognize these attacks as press freedom 
violations. This failure stems in some instances from deeply ingrained prejudices 
against homosexuals and in other cases from resignation, a belief that those prejudices 
will be acted out without fear of retribution.<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Attacks by Authorities</CITE>
<BR>
<BR>
In countries all over the world, homosexuals are subject to legal persecution. In 
addition to imposing flat-out bans on gay sex and press coverage of homosexuality, 
authorities have often invoked laws against child exploitation to silence gay and 
lesbian journalists. In Canada, for instance, Joseph Couture, a reporter for CBC Radio and 
the Toronto gay and lesbian biweekly newspaper <CITE>XTra! </CITE>
had to battle efforts to frame him on charges of child pornography after he produced 
a radio documentary and wrote a series of articles that were critical of the police 
force's relationship with the gay and lesbian community and of its enforcement of 
child pornography laws. In Romania, opposition editor and publisher Bozdog Ovidiu was 
imprisoned by local authorities for purportedly having sex with minors.<BR>
<BR>
Authorities in several countries also admit to keeping "pink lists" of known homosexuals, 
which often include journalists because of the public nature of their work. These 
lists are often used to target and threaten them with prosecution for crimes they 
did not commit.<BR>
<BR>
Such cases have generally escaped the attention of press freedom and human rights 
organizations. In part, this stems from the marginal position of much of the gay 
and lesbian press and the de facto exclusion of gay and lesbian journalists from 
mainstream professional journalistic communities. Partly, too, established groups have been reluctant 
to take on such cases because they raise uncomfortable questions about whether the 
organizations should stand up for the right to engage in sexually explicit speech or defend a journalist accused of a crime as hideous as child exploitation. In addition, 
official forces hostile to the gay and lesbian media have long capitalized on the 
mainstream media's discomfort with issues of sexuality to engage in attacks that 
are nothing more than attempts to limit press freedom and intimidate reporters.<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Attacks by Nongovernmental Forces</CITE>
<BR>
<BR>
When a gay journalist or news outlet is attacked by a nonofficial source, such as 
an extremist group or urban gang, accountability rests not only with the perpetrators 
but also, in instances where the police or other law enforcement agents fail to prosecute them, with the state. Without official cooperation in the prosecution of such crimes, 
gay and lesbian journalists will continue to work under hostile conditions.<BR>
<BR>
Many gay journalists consider a certain amount of violence and harassment a natural 
attribute of their work. During interviews for this report, editors of gay and lesbian 
publications would often say, "Oh, nothing happens to us. Just the usual hate mail 
and phone calls." This resignation stems from a pattern of neglect by authorities, 
as illustrated by two cases in India and Russia, where the police failed to adequately 
pursue the criminals.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the continuing hostilities around the world, there is some good news to report. 
U.S. journalists say that harassment has decreased significantly over time. For example, 
one of the first gay and lesbian newspapers, Boston's <CITE>Gay Community News, </CITE>
was the victim of arson three times between 1972 and 1981, as was one of the first 
lesbian publishing houses, Daughters Inc. in Plainfield, Vt. But in the 1990s, with 
gay and lesbian newspapers operating in all major U.S. cities and many smaller towns, 
no instances of arson have been reported. Publishers of relatively long-lived newspapers, 
such as Chicago's 12-year-old <CITE>Windy City Times, </CITE>
say that they now face far less harassment in the way of hate mail, phone calls 
and threats of violence than they did in the 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Censorship and Related Harassment</CITE>
<BR>
<BR>
It stands to reason that the largest number of cases documented for this report can 
be classified as censorship. Censorship mechanisms, such as obscenity and anti-pornography 
statutes, pose one of the greatest threats to press freedom anywhere, and are certainly the greatest and most consistent threat to publications with gay and lesbian 
content.* Legal authorities everywhere say the same thing: Obscenity statutes protect 
the moral standards of local communities. Given that in most areas of the world gays and lesbians are seen as threatening the moral fabric of society, obscenity statutes 
are turned against them again and again, ultimately suppressing not only sexually 
explicit writing but any coverage of gay and lesbian issues.<BR>
<BR>
So, too, are broad-stroke laws employed to prohibit the "promotion" of homosexuality--the 
censorious state's answer to the increasing visibility of gays and lesbians and the 
growing influence of their media outlets. Clause 28 of the United Kingdom's Local 
Government Act of 1988, for instance, prohibits local government authorities--who control 
significant public funds--from intentionally promoting homosexuality or teaching the 
acceptability of homosexuality. Though Clause 28 has not resulted in any court cases to date, all reports indicate that its impact has been pervasive. A library in 
York, for instance, excluded two articles about homosexuality from an exhibit for 
fear of violating the prohibition. Halfway across the world, in Nicaragua, there 
is a four-year-old law on the books that is similar in spirit to the United Kingdom's clause 
but far broader in scope.<BR>
<BR>
Fear also drives the decisions of private distributors who, wary of legal trouble 
under obscenity statutes or other legislation, often resist carrying gay and lesbian 
publications. The weekly newsmagazine <CITE>Gay Times </CITE>
in London, for instance, struggled for years to be accepted by the large private 
chains that distribute most of England's magazines. As a result of such resistance, 
many gay and lesbian newspapers have opted to distribute free of charge, which in 
most instances means they have to fight for the legal protections that would be accorded 
them if they provided a product with a stated commercial value. There has been some 
progress made on this issue in parts of the United States. The governor of Maryland, 
for instance, in 1994 signed into law a bill that makes it a crime of theft to take copies 
of a free newspaper with the intent of preventing others from reading it. But such 
legal recourse is far from the norm in most countries, where obstacles to distribution are one of the many problems the gay media must face as a result of the deeply entrenched 
homophobia at work in the creation and application of censorship laws today.<BR>
<BR>
The cases CPJ has documented are only a small sampling of the press freedom violations 
that continue to plague gay and lesbian journalists. There are doubtless many more 
that have yet to be reported, but we hope that with the publication of this work, 
journalists will become more attuned to these injustices--to recognize them as more than 
gay-bashing and to report them to the Committee to Protect Journalists and other 
press freedom and human rights groups around the world.<BR>
<BR>
*The Committee to Protect Journalists does not take a position on the substance of 
a country's morality and obscenity statutes but rather investigates cases where they 
have been applied in a discriminatory manner, hindering a journalist's right to report 
without persecution or obstructing the free flow of news across borders.<BR>

<h3>A Record 182 Cases of Reporters Imprisoned</h3>
<BR>
At the end of 1995, at least 182 journalists in 22 countries were in prison for their reporting. In many 
cases, they were being held without charge or trial. Officially, these journalists 
may have been charged with or convicted of committing offenses ranging from disseminating separatist propaganda to expressing contempt for the head of state or insulting 
an official. But, in truth, the only crime these journalists committed was publishing 
or broadcasting something their governments didn't like.<BR>
<BR>
This year's count is the largest ever documented by CPJ. At the end of 1994, 173 journalists 
in 23 countries were behind bars. Two years ago, CPJ documented 126 cases of imprisoned 
journalists in 28 countries.<BR>
<BR>
By region, the 1995 count breaks down as follows. In the Middle East and North Africa, 
86 journalists were in prison, more than half of them in Turkey; and there were 47 
imprisoned journalists in Africa, 41 in Asia and eight in the Americas. No journalists are in prison in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, where governments are 
using economic pressure to keep the press in line.<BR>
<BR>
For the second consecutive year, Turkey had the largest number of incarcerated journalists, 
51. This number is down from last year's 74, due in part to a revision (thanks to 
European pressure) of Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which had been used to prosecute journalists who wrote about the Kurdish issue. There were 31 journalists in 
prison in Ethiopia, following a post-election crackdown on the independent media. 
China had 20 journalists behind bars. Kuwait has held the same 18 journalists prisoner 
since 1991; all of them were accused of collaboration for having worked on a newspaper 
published during the Iraqi occupation.<BR>
<BR>
Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria each held eight journalists in jail. All 
eight journalists in Nigeria, which has had a proud tradition of press independence, 
were arrested as part of a 1995 campaign by the military junta to quash all dissent. 
Among those arrested and imprisoned was Nosa Igiebor, editor of <CITE>Tell </CITE>
magazine and a 1993 CPJ International Press Freedom honoree. Another CPJ awardee, 
Ahmad Taufik, president of Indonesia's Alliance of Independent Journalists, began 
serving a three-year prison term during the year. Three other Indonesian journalists 
are also imprisoned.<BR>
<BR>
Syria's three longest-held journalists were released in 1995. But six others remained 
in prison, including three who have been in jail for 10 years or more. In Algeria, 
journalists, who live in fear of assassination by religious extremists, had to contend with government repression as well. The government had imprisoned four reporters 
in 1995, the most ever documented by CPJ in Algeria. And Libya still held the world's 
longest-imprisoned journalist, Abdallah Ali al-Sanussi al-Darrat, who has been in 
prison since 1975.<BR>
<BR>
International pressure can help set these journalists free. In 1995, after an international 
campaign led by CPJ and others, Cuba released Yndamiro Restano, a founding member 
of the Cuban Association of Independent Journalists and a 1994 winner of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award. We ask you to take the time to write to at least 
one of the leaders listed below, respectfully urging them to release these prisoners 
immediately. <BR>

Benaamane, a correspondent for the official Algerian Press Service (APS) in the southern 
town of Tamanrasset, was arrested by security forces. The reasons for Benaamane's 
imprisonment are unclear, but reports indicate that he was charged with "attacking 
the security of the state and national unity" in connection with an internal APS news 
wire report he filed on the whereabouts of Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, leaders 
of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) who had recently been transferred from Janan 
al-Mufti prison to a detention center in the desert. Benaamane appeared before a Tamanrasset 
military court on July 10. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison.<BR>

Mbawa, publisher of the independent <CITE>Cameroon Post, </CITE>
was sentenced on July 13, 1995, to six months in prison on charges of libeling a 
company director in an April issue of his paper. He was imprisoned in mid-August. 
Mbawa is contesting the conviction on the grounds that he was never presented a summons 
to the July 13 hearing. Mbawa's defense was hampered when his attorney, Julius Achu, 
dropped the case due to pressure from his older brother, Prime Minister Simon Achidi 
Achu. The <CITE>Cameroon Post </CITE>

a 15-year sentence for "counterrevolutionary" activities that included writing essays 
strongly criticizing the government and calling for democratic rule. Following his

prison, where he was serving a 13-year sentence for his role in the Tiananmen Square 
demonstrations. His rearrest was believed to be linked to his 24-hour fast on the 
sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and to his endorsement of a petition 
in May 1995 calling for freedom of expression and the release of political prisoners. 
Chen, a 1991 recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award, was originally 
arrested in October 1989, labeled one of the "black hands" behind the Tiananmen Square 
demonstrations and convicted of conducting counterrevolutionary activities. He was 
released on parole for treatment of cancer, hepatitis and heart disease.<BR>

Beijing police detained Wang, a former student leader and frequent contributor to 
overseas publications, after he signed petitions calling for the release of Tiananmen 
Square-era political prisoners and for new legal protections of human rights. The 
Hong Kong daily <CITE>Lien Ho Pao </CITE>
reported in late July 1995 that Beijing authorities planned to prosecute Wang for 
inciting citizens to conduct anti-government activities, openly attacking the socialist 
system, disrupting public security and undermining social stability. The newspaper 
also reported that public security officials had collected all of Wang's "offensive" 
articles published abroad as evidence against him.<BR>

51 Confirmed Cases of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in 1995*<BR>
<BR>
CPJ has confirmed 51 cases of journalists who were killed in 1995 for reasons directly 
related to their work. Six confirmed deaths--one each in Azerbaijan, Burundi, Croatia 
and Somalia, and two in Chechnya--were combat casualties. The other 45 cases all appear to have been homicides.<BR>
<BR>
For the second consecutive year, Algeria was the most dangerous place in the world 
for journalists. The 24 Algerian reporters and editors murdered by rebel terrorists 
in 1995 accounted for nearly half the job-related deaths of journalists in the world 
during the year.<BR>
<BR>
Since May 1993, when Islamist rebels began targeting local reporters and editors, 
53 journalists have been assassinated in Algeria--the largest number of press corps 
casualties CPJ has recorded in any country over the past 10 years.<BR>
<BR>
In other disturbing developments, three provincial magazine publishers and an editor 
were murdered in separate and unrelated incidents in Brazil, where violent crimes 
against journalists had been rare. In three of the cases, the journalists had been 
covering corruption and human rights abuses by local government officials and police.<BR>
<BR>
The breakdown of CPJ's confirmed cases is as follows: <BR>
<BR>
 <ul>
<li>24 journalists killed in Algeria;<BR>
 <li>7 journalists killed in Russia;<BR>
 <li>4 journalists killed in Brazil;<BR>
<li> 3 journalists killed in Colombia; and<BR>
 <li>1 journalist killed in each of the following countries--Angola, Azerbaijan, Burundi, 
Canada, Croatia, Dominican Republic, India, Mexico, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, 
Uganda and Ukraine.<BR>
</ul>
<BR>
Staff researchers at CPJ are investigating another nine deaths of journalists in 1995. 
In some cases, it has not yet been determined if their deaths were directly related 
to their profession. And in four of the cases, regarding journalists who are missing in Chechnya, the subjects are feared dead but searches continue.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, 73 journalists were killed. Fifty-nine of these deaths were homicides and 
14 were combat casualties.<BR>
<BR>
This report also includes an account of journalists <A HREF="att95front.html#456 Killed">killed in the line of duty</a> in the past decade.

when dos Reis murdered Borges, he was accompanied by the wife of the regional police

Kampala<BR>
Njuki, editor of the opposition weekly newsletter <CITE>Assalaam, </CITE>
died in police custody in a hospital. He had been arrested three days earlier and 
was immediately taken to the Criminal Investigations Division (CID). While CPJ has 
received several different reports regarding his arrest and death, it is certain 
that he was taken into custody by a group of plainclothesmen from the Anti-Robbery Squad, an 
extension of the government's Internal Security Organization (ISO). One source claimed 
that Njuki had been suffering from a debilitating illness, the effects of which were fatally exacerbated by the shock of the ambush by the ISO squad. Another source reports 
that Njuki was in perfect health before the arrest and was beaten to death by ISO 
agents. Yet another report contends that he collapsed during an attempt to escape 
and died in the hospital of a heart attack. A police guard remained in Njuki's hospital 
room throughout his stay.<BR>

Sebastopol<BR>
Ivanov, editor in chief of the Sebastopol local daily <CITE>The Glory of Sebastopol, </CITE>
was fatally injured when a bomb, triggered by a remote control, exploded in a garbage 
can outside his home on April 14. He was taken to a local hospital where he underwent 
three operations and had his legs amputated. He died of his wounds four days after the explosion. Ivanov was an ethnic Russian, and his paper's editorial line supported 
greater autonomy for the predominantly Russian population of Crimea. Shortly before 
the attempt on his life, Ivanov had begun a campaign in his newspaper denouncing 
the Crimean Mafia and protesting the construction of an oil refinery by a Ukrainian-Swedish 
company. His newspaper had also recently published several articles supporting the 
creation of a free trade zone in Sebastopol, a plan that was expected to strengthen Crimean autonomy. <BR>

they were killed while in custody of Bosnian Muslims. According to a Bosnian Serb 
Television reporter who was riding with them at the time of the incident, Bosnian 
troops shot at their vehicle, seriously wounding or killing Kolevski and Pejcinovic. The body

<STRONG>HONORED FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE<BR>
</STRONG>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>

<A NAME="Awards"><H2>Journalists Receive 1995 International Press Freedom Awards</H2></a>

<BR>
The International Press Freedom Awards are given annually by CPJ to journalists around the world who have courageously provided 
independent news coverage and viewpoints under difficult circumstances. To defend 
press freedom, award winners have risked arrest, imprisonment, violence against themselves and their families, and even death.<BR>
<BR>
The 1995 Awards were presented on Dec. 6 in New York City to the following people: <STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<STRONG>Yevgeny Kiselyov</STRONG>
 is cofounder of NTV, Russia's first financially and editorially independent television 
network, and anchor of its uncompromising news show "Itogi." Under Kiselyov's leadership, 
NTV has proved to be a reliable and unbiased news source. Its reputation--both in the minds of the viewers and the Kremlin--was cemented by its unflinching coverage 
of the Chechen conflict. Kiselyov was warned that he risked losing NTV's license 
if he did not present the government's policy in a more favorable light. Presenting 
the award, ABC News' Peter Jennings said of Kiselyov, "He was the one who took the phone 
call from the Kremlin and ignored it. And it was Kiselyov who went on the air when 
his colleague Vladislav Listyev was murdered and called it what it was--an act of 
intimidation." Kiselyov accepted the award on behalf of all Russian journalists who have 
resisted threats of censorship and other government pressure to provide the Russian 
public with balanced coverage of the Chechen conflict and other matters of public 
interest.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Jos&eacute; Rub&eacute;n Zamora Marroqu&iacute;n</STRONG>
 is founder and editor in chief of Guatemala's most daring newspaper, <CITE>Siglo Veintiuno </CITE>
(21st Century). In a country where at least 50 journalists of Zamora's generation 
have been killed for their work, his paper is known for its expos&eacute;s of corruption, 
drug trafficking and human rights violations. In May 1993, when the president suspended 
the constitution, shut down the legislature and sent state censors under military guard 
to all newspaper offices, Zamora altered the paper's masthead to <CITE>Siglo Catorce--</CITE>
14th Century--and ran solid blocks of ink in place of censored stories about the president's 
actions. "Without the power of the word, there was only the power of silence," said 
award-winning photojournalist Susan Meiselas presenting the award. "Zamora believed that silence could be heard." Readers understood, and while army troops seized 
copies and burned them in the streets, Zamora faxed the original uncensored newspapers 
around the world. The daily's coverage of the president's actions helped fuel an 
international protest, ultimately forcing him to quit and flee the country in disgrace. 
"You may think that we are courageous," Zamora told the guests at the awards dinner, 
"but in my country, many people think we are crazy. This award proves to us that 
we are the sane ones."<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Fred M'membe</STRONG>
, editor in chief of Zambia's leading independent newspaper, <CITE>The Post, </CITE>
faces criminal charges that could result in up to 100 years in prison for his paper's 
expos&eacute;s of drug trafficking, abuses of power and government corruption. <CITE>The Post </CITE>
became a defiant voice as Frederick Chiluba, the country's first democratically elected 
president, began to renege on his promises for reform. "As M'membe has written,the 
bitter truth is that free and fair elections do not guarantee the end to human rights violations," said NBC's Jane Pauley presenting the award. Chiluba has demonstrated 
his intolerance by invoking colonial-era statutes against M'membe for criminal libel, 
treason and "ridicule of the president"-- a charge for which truth is not a defense. In anticipation of the October 1996 presidential election in Zambia, Chiluba seems 
determined to silence M'membe by jailing him or closing down <CITE>The Post, </CITE>
whose offices have been raided frequently by the military and by government-supported 
thugs. M'membe still stands strong. "I have always believed that there are supporters 
of press freedom, but I didn't know there were so many," he told guests at the awards dinner. "This to me is a big encouragement, that we are not on our own. We've 
got friends who do not face the same threats we face every day but are equally committed 
to the cause for which we stand. I will go back home more committed than ever before."<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Ahmad Taufik </STRONG>
is president of Indonesia's only independent journalists union and the unofficial 
leader of the country's free press movement. He is serving three years in prison 
for publishing an unlicensed magazine, <CITE>Independen, </CITE>
and for expressing "feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government." 
The 30-year-old Taufik helped found the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) 
in August 1994 as an alternative to the state-sponsored union, which had acquiesced 
in the government's decision to ban three leading investigative newsweeklies. AJI led 
public protests against President Suharto's crackdown on the press and began publishing 
<CITE>Independen</CITE>
. The magazine ran investigative stories on government corruption that provoked the 
ire of officials such as Information Minister Harmoko, who, according to the magazine's 
reports, forced newspapers to issue him shares in their companies in return for granting them publishing licenses. Taufik was presented his award in absentia by <CITE>New York Times </CITE>
columnist William Safire, who read a statement Taufik wrote in his prison cell: "To 
the [Indonesian] government, the press is something to be feared, to be regarded 
as an enemy to be crushed. The press is therefore subject to censorship and intimidation. Fellow journalists, I thank you for this award. I feel that it is not just for myself 
but for my colleagues at AJI, for other Indonesian journalists and for all those 
whose goal is freedom of the press." CPJ has initiated a letter-writing campaign 
to secure the release of Taufik and three of his AJI colleagues.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Veronica Guerin</STRONG>
, Ireland's leading investigative reporter, covers the criminal underworld for the 
<CITE>Sunday Independent, </CITE>
the country's most widely read newspaper. As a result of her work, she has been 
the target of death threats and has been physically assaulted. In January 1995, the 
day after she published an article profiling the man suspected of masterminding the 
largest robbery in Ireland's history, she was shot and wounded in her home by a masked 
intruder. The attack was believed to be a warning from organized crime bosses. But 
in an article she wrote about the incident, Guerin vowed to continue her investigations 
and said, "I am letting the public know exactly how this society operates." "Guerin 
is known not only for her fearless reporting but for her accuracy," said the award 
presenter, Lesley Stahl of CBS' "60 Minutes." "Her commitment to defending the public's 
right to read the truth is impregnable." In September 1995, Guerin was attacked again, 
this time by a businessman who slammed her head against her car and threatened to 
kill her if she wrote about him. Her plight is a grim reminder that Western journalists 
sometimes face great risks in their own backyards simply for doing their jobs.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Benjamin C. Bradlee</STRONG>
 was honored with CPJ's Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for his lifelong dedication 
to press freedom. As executive editor of the <CITE>Washington Post </CITE>
from 1968 to 1991, Bradlee oversaw reporting that profoundly affected the public's 
perception of pivotal events in U.S. history and forever changed how Americans view 
government. In 1971, despite the threat of legal action by the Nixon administration, 
Bradlee published the Pentagon Papers, the classified Defense Department history of 
U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The next year--at great risk to all involved--the <CITE>Post </CITE>
began the investigations that exposed the Watergate scandal, ultimately leading to 
President Nixon's resignation in 1974. "Ben had the courage to offend," said one 
of his star investigative reporters, Bob Woodward, who presented him with the award. 
"He never edited the <CITE>Washington Post </CITE>
for his friends or for a set of ideas, political or otherwise."<BR>
