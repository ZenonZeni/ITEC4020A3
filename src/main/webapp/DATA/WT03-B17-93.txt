<H2>Who Uses EANx ?</H2>
<UL><P>EANx was first used in 1912 and has been used extensively for over 30 years by 
commercial organizations and the military.  It has also been used in the medical field as a 
therapy gas.  Advanced level divers have been taking advantage of EANx for cave diving, 
wreck diving, marine harvest and many other diving applications.  More recently EANx has 
been recognized by national scuba diving certification agencies as an alternate breathing 
gas for recreational diving.</UL>
