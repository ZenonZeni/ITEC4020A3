<H2>Definition of Terms</H2>
<A NAME="notice"></A><BR>
<STRONG>Notice</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
In an online context, notice means that online service subscribers or Internet
users learn from the online service provider or web site about whether and
to what extent personal information is being collected and used.  <A NAME=
"informed"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Informed</STRONG> (an important subset of notice)<BR>
<BR>
For a notice of information practice to be truly effective, it must be clearly
written and non-coercive.  For you to be &quot;informed&quot; means understanding
who is collecting information about your online activities, and the purposes
for which the information is being collected.  <BR>
<BR>
There are two ways in which your personal information (including product
preferences, relevant interests and direct contact information) can be collected.
 First, when you actively provide information to a web site, such as when
you purchase products or register as a member, you are actively providing
personal information that may be collected and stored for a particular purpose.
 Second, while you are engaged in &quot;passive&quot; online activity --
for example when you are lurking in chat rooms, reading bulletin boards,
or browsing through online resources -- your personal information is also
being collected, and possibly stored or used for other purposes.  Thus,
personal information can be collected through both your passive browsing
and active communication.  <BR>
<BR>
Notice of information practices is particularly important when you participate
in online passive activity and you have the illusion of anonymity, as well
as when your personal information is to be used for a purpose unrelated
to the one for which you provided your information.<A NAME="consent"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Consent</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The principal of consent means that you give an organization permission
to handle your information in a way that you choose.  When you give personally
identifiable information to an organization or when you engage in an activity
that generates a record, the individual or entity collecting your information
should get your &quot;informed consent&quot; --  which means that before
your consent can be considered meaningful, you will be given <A HREF="#notice">full
details about what information is to be collected, the purpose of the collection,
and when the information will be disclosed to others</A>. <A NAME="secondary"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Secondary Use</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Secondary use means that the information collected about you for one purpose
is used for a second, unrelated purpose.  A fundamental fair information
principle is that you must be given the opportunity to choose whether you
want your information used for a secondary purpose.  This allows you to
provide personal information for a specific purpose without worrying that
the information may be later used for an unrelated purpose without your
permission.   <A NAME="access"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Access</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Access is defined as the ability to see and obtain the information that
an entity has collected about you.  You should also have the opportunity
to <A HREF="#correction">amend records</A> that are not accurate, relevant,
timely or complete.  Over the Internet, the access principle may be achieved
in real-time (immediately upon request). <A NAME="correction"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Correction</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
If information about you is incomplete or inaccurate, an entity should always
give you the ability to make additions or corrections.  <A NAME="downstream"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Down Stream Data Use</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Down stream data use means that information collected about you may be disclosed
to other parties &quot;downstream&quot; to facilitate a transaction.  For
example, suppose you are a member of a commercial online service provider
(e.g., America Online), and you want to order a product from a content provider
on that service (e.g., L.L. Bean).  You may directly give the content provider
your personal information, such as your address, telephone number and credit
card number.  Or your commercial online service provider may give the content
provider your personal information so that your order may be completed.
 Then, the content provider may disclose your personal information to a
shipping company (e.g., Federal Express) so that your order can be delivered
to your house.  The content provider may also disclose your personal information
to a billing or credit card company (e.g., Visa) so that they can charge
you for this transaction.  <A NAME="remedies"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Remedies</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Remedies is a legal term that describes ways that you can be compensated
for harm caused by another individual or entity.  An example would be the
awarding of monetary damages, or a judicial order requiring specific action
to fix the harm.<A NAME="anonymity"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Anonymity</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
To be anonymous means your true identity is not known at all.  Pseudonymity
means you have taken on an assumed identity.  Your online  service provider
may allow you, as a subscriber, to participate in online activities anonymously
(not known at all) or pseudonymously (taking on a different identity). 
 <A NAME="security"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Security</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Security means technical measures that you or your online service provider
may take to protect your privacy.  There are a number of ways online services
can safeguard data, through passwords, audit trails, and encryption.  <A
NAME="use"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Use</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Use means that your personal data is collected and is being used internally
within the company or organization, for both administrative and marketing
purposes; e.g., an online service provider using its own subscriber data
to market a new service to its subscribers.<A NAME="disclosure"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Disclosure</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Disclosure means that the company or organization makes your personal information
available to third parties, e.g., marketing lists, other companies providing
similar services, etc. <A NAME="online"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commercial Online Service</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A commercial online service maintains a closed proprietary network that
provides a variety of information and other services to its subscribers.
 Commercial online services generally provide their own content, forums,
and information available only to its subscribers. <A NAME="subscription"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Subscription Data</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Subscription data is the information that you provide to an online service
when you sign up to become a member.  Subscription data usually includes
your name, physical address, email address, billing information, and telephone
numbers.<A NAME="person_id"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Personally Identifiable Transactional Data</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Personally identifiable transactional data is the information describing
your online activities, including web sites you have visited, <A HREF="#e-mail">whom
you have sent email</A>, what files you have downloaded, and other information
revealed in the normal course of using the Internet.  Transactional data
differs from the <A HREF="#content">content of a communication</A> in that
it is not the actual substance of your communication, but the information
about your communication. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, the content of your communications has received greater protections
in the law that transactional data.  Recent developments in the law have
given greater protections to transactional data in that it is just as revealing
as the content of your communications.  <A NAME="collection"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Collection</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The collection of personal information online occurs in two ways.  First,
information is collected through your active provision of information, such
as when you purchase a product online or when you join as a member of a
web site.  Second, while you are engaged in &quot;passive&quot; online activity
-- for example when you are lurking in chat rooms, reading bulletin boards,
or browsing through online resources -- your personal information is also
being collected and possibly stored, all under your illusion of anonymity.
Also, when you <A HREF="#ftp">ftp a file</A>, your actions may generate
a record that is personally identifiable.  <A NAME="limitation"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Limitation on Collection</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Collection should be limited only to information necessary to complete the
transaction.  In instances where <A HREF="#person_id">personally identifiable
information</A> is not necessary to support the activity, you should have
an opportunity to limit its collection.  The goal of this principle is to
avoid unnecessary information collection and to prevent people from taking
advantage of you by collecting more information than necessary as a condition
of providing you a service or product.  For instance, if an online service
provider required you to provide a copy of your tax returns as a condition
of becoming a member, it would be far beyond information that the service
needed to sign you up as a subscriber.<A NAME="content"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Content</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The content of a communication is the actual text of the communication or
information sent.  This includes files, text or graphics.  For example,
content is the text of your email message or your <A HREF="#newsgroup">Usenet
posting</A>.  Content does not include routing information, the date, time,
or subject of the message, or other  <A HREF="#person_id">transactional
data</A>. <A NAME="e-mail"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>E-mail Header</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The email header is the transactional information that identifies the sender
and recipient of a message, routing information, the date and time at which
the message was sent, and the subject of the message.<A NAME="downloaded"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Downloaded</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
In this context, downloaded e-mail may also include mail that is read online.
 Check your online service provider agreement for specific details.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="ISP"></A><STRONG>Glossary of Internet Terms</STRONG></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>Internet Service Provider (ISP)<BR>

content of your message is appropriate for the group) and some are unmoderated
(not screened prior to posting).<A NAME="maillist"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Mailing list<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG>Mailing lists are email-based discussion forums on various topics
of interest.   An interested Internet user can subscribe to a mailing list
by sending an e-mail message containing appropriate instructions to a specific
e-mail address.  The computer that houses the mailing list program maintains
a list of subscribers and routes all posted messages to subscribers' electronic
mailboxes.   Mailing lists are either publicly and privately maintained,
and can be moderated or unmoderated.<A NAME="site"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Web site</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A web site is a specific area of the Internet that integrates a variety
of files, such as text, graphics, sound, and video files.  Companies, governments,
non-profit organizations and individuals can all provide information and
interactive services through their web sites.  Anyone with a web site can
be considered a content provider, or a publisher.<A NAME="browser"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Web browser<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG>A web browser is a program that allows you to search or surf the
World Wide Web.  Some examples of web browsers include Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer.<A NAME="ftp"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A software protocol that is used to transfer files from a remote host over
a network to another computer.  FTP is also used as a command to execute
the file transfer.  Many systems support so-called &quot;anonymous FTP&quot;,
in which you can access a remote host without revealing your user id or
password on that system. <BR>
