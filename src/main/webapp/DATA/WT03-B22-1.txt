<H1>What Are Commercially Published Standardized Tests
</H1>
<IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle>
</CENTER>
<P>
Published tests are developed by authors who have a superior understanding
of a subject and of measurement. The author's goal in
developing a commercially published test is to provide other professionals
with a means of assessing some characteristic of other people.

<P>
Commercially published tests provide three great benefits....
<UL>
<LI SRC="bullet.gif">Through their tests, the authors are able to share their expert knowledge of how assessments may be conducted.
<LI SRC="bullet.gif">The economics of publishing is such that commercially published tests are often of a quality that would not be economically
feasible to produce for use in a single province or state.
<LI SRC="bullet.gif">Standardized tests have been <B><EM>researched</EM></B>, so it is possible to relate the scores produced by any individual to those of a large population.
The test manual provides <EM>norms</EM>
which rate an examinee's score on a test against the scores of
a large reference population (sometimes referred to as the standardization
sample). 
</UL>

<P>
<H1>What Do Standardized Tests Measure?</H1>

<P>
The process of assessment is a process of human interaction. During the process, one individual tries to form an understanding (opinion or belief) about another. In some cases, it
is possible to provide questionnaires or present tasks which provide a sample of behavior that will assist the assessor in forming his oppinion. Standardized tests may be used to attempt to measure the relative prevalence of skills and abilities, target behaviors, reported feelings and beliefs, etc. 
<H2>Hard Area Tests</H2>

<P>
Tests which measure <EM>skills and abilities</EM> are variously
called aptitude tests, achievement tests, diagnostic tests, IQ
tests, etc. These may be classed as within the &quot;hard&quot;
area of measurement. It is possible for an examinee to adopt a
responding strategy on these tests so as to &quot;fake bad&quot;
and cause a lower score on these tests than honest effort would
obtain. However, it is not possible to &quot;fake good&quot; and
get a higher score than honest effort would produce.
<H2>Soft Area Tests</H2>

<P>
Tests which ask questions about an individual's past behaviors, beliefs or feelings
are classed as operating in the &quot;soft&quot; area of measurement.
These are called personality tests, interest inventories, honesty
and reliability tests, etc. Since these tests are mostly self-reports
of thoughts, beliefs and feelings, or past behavior, there are no <EM>right or wrong</EM>
responses -- only honest and dishonest ones. It is possible for examinees to design their responses
to such tests in order to present themselves in a favorable light (called faking good), to answer honestly, to present themselves in an unfavorable light (called faking bad, or even to respond completely randomly. It is also possible for
examinees to respond differently from one day to another (depending
on other outside factors) in a manner which may still technically
be considered honest.From the foregoing, one can see that the examiner is faced with
the task of assessing the client's responding strategy before
(s)he even begins to assess what a soft area test suggests about
the examinee. Many such tests include &quot;lie&quot; scales that
attempt to identify examinees whose responding strategy is
grossly dishonest. However, even the best of these tests cannot control very 
well for some individuals' natural tendency toward &quot;openness&quot;
and &quot;frankness&quot; and the tendency of others to be more
circumspect.<P>
<H3>Does this Mean Soft Area Tests are Useless?</H3>

<P>
<B>No!</B> Soft area tests may be <EM>very</EM> useful for counsellors
who have the cooperation of their clients. <EM>Vocational couselling</EM>
has been facilitated to a great extent by a group of tests called <EM>interest
inventories</EM>. Though for pre-employment testing these inventories
are essentially useless. Soft area tests also may be of help to
experienced psychologists who can make some sense of the client's
responding strategy. The great danger of all soft area tests
is that beginners (or those from other disciplines -- i.e. lawyers)
often want to read more into a test result than is there. Most
well designed and researched soft area scales comprised of twenty or more unique items are capable of ranking an individual as Low,
Normal, or High in terms of a target characteristic. Attempting
to read more than this into a test score is usually not supportable. While
the experienced professional knows that the difference of a couple
of score points either way should signify nothing on soft area
tests -- the problem exists that at some specific point it is
considered necessary to begin calling a score high, or low.  This fact alone frustrates computer analysis of test scores, because computers require an algorithm that includes a very specific point at which a score is to be considered high.
<P>
The best solution is to retain the services of an experienced
professional psychologist if you require the type of information
that is provided by soft area tests -- although this may not be
required in cases of vocational counselling.
