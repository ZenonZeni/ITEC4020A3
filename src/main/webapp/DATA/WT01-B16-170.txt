<TITLE>High Cholesterol</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>Desirable blood cholesterol level is below 200. Borderline
is from 200 to 239. Cholesterol levels of over 240 are considered to be high.
The number 240 was chosen as the cutoff point because at this level and above,
the risk of heart attack rises steeply.
<P>If the total cholesterol is found to be borderline or high, then the LDL
(bad cholesterol) and the HDL (good cholesterol) chould be measured. You
want the LDL to be below 130 and the HDL to be above 40.
<P>The first approach to the treatment of high cholesterol is a low fat diet.
Information on this type of diet is available for free in our office. If
diet alone is unable to control the cholesterol then we must use drug therapy
also. There are many effective medications for lowering cholesterol now
available. Some of these have now been shown to actually reduce the clogging
of arteries with cholesterol plaque called atherosclerosis.
