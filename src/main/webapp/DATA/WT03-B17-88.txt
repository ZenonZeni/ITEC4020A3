<BLOCKQUOTE><H1>Diving with Great White Sharks- <FONT SIZE=+2>A First-Hand Report</FONT></H1>
<P>Our April white shark expedition to South Africa brought us an average four sharks per day!  These majestic beasts varied from eight to fourteen feet in length and usually put up a good fight with the bait lines.  Playing tug of war over large pieces of meat made us very aware of the enormous size and power of the animals.  It also gave us a chance to get very very close to them, both from the boat and in the water.
<P>
The first half of the trip consisted mainly of counting, sizing, sexing, tagging and photographing the sharks from the boat, as strong swells kept us out of the cage.  The second half was spent in excited haste as we took turns getting intimate with them from the submerged safety of the welded steel wire cage.  Large ports allow you to reach out and touch a great white, even take a close up of his teeth if you dare.  On the last day, we witnessed a natural predation by a white shark on one of the seal pups from a nearby colony.

 <P>At the end of most days, cold water and heavy expenditures of adrenaline leave you just enough energy for dinner, beers, a video and sleep in a very comfortable setting.  Nonetheless, South Africa is a country with great natural diversity and beauty and if at all possible, time should be set aside to see it.  Because of the strong interest in this trip, we are adding it to our regular schedule, with the next one coming up in March, 1997.
