<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton:
Illegal Aliens = No
Contracts</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>President Clinton pledged in his January 23, 1996 State of the Union speech
to issue an Executive Order that might bar companies convicted of knowingly
hiring unauthorized workers from doing business with the federal government for
one year.  Further violations could extend the bar.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 26 million persons are employed by federal contractors and
subcontractors.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton said: "After years and years of neglect, this administration has
taken on a strong stand to stiffen protection on our borders.  We are
increasing border patrols by 50 percent; we are increasing inspections to find
illegal immigrants in the workplace.  And tonight, I announce I will sign an
executive order to deny federal contracts to business that hire illegal
immigrants.  But let me be clear: we are still a nation of immigrants, and we
honor all those immigrants who are working hard to become new citizens.  But we
are also a nation of laws. " </tt><p>
<tt>Employers could still get federal contracts if they were fined for
paperwork violations, such as incomplete I-9 forms.  Most INS fines are for
paperwork violations--in Northern California, for example, only about 10
percent of the INS fines levied on employers since 1988 have been for knowingly
hiring illegal workers.  Since 1988, there have been 16,570 INS notices of
intent to fine US employers, including 1,427 in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>The Executive Order would establish a system for federal agencies to be
notified if a company is caught employing unauthorized workers.  Under one
version of the plan, the INS would notify the federal agency that does the most
business with an employer who hired illegal aliens.  The federal government let
85,000 new contracts in 1994, and purchased goods and services worth $200
billion.</tt><p>
<tt>One agency frequently criticized is the General Services Administration,
which has in some cases not taken action against contractors who have hired
illegal aliens to build or maintain the 7,000 owned and leased buildings in
which federal government employees work.</tt><p>
<tt>Some see the proposed Executive Order as another symbolic effort to show
that the Administration is getting tough on illegal immigration.  Federal
contractors are already required to obey federal and state laws, and the
government publishes a monthly list of firms ineligible for federal
contracts.</tt><p>
<tt>If enacted, it is not clear how soon the Executive Order would enter into
force.  A March 1995 Executive Order that makes ineligible for federal
contracts businesses that permanently replace striking workers has been held up
in court, and is not yet in effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans sponsors of immigration reform proposals in Congress supported
the President's action, suggesting that it would further their efforts to
combat the employment of illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, chair of the US Commission on
Immigration Reform, died on January 17, leaving the CIR without a national
spokesperson.  Jordan had been instrumental in shaping a consensus immigration
issues.</tt><p>

<tt>Alien apprehensions doubled along the US-Mexican border in December 1995
versus year earlier levels.  To prevent what some feared would be a massive
surge of illegal immigrants, the INS on January 16, 1996 added 300 more agents
to the California-Arizona borders to discourage illegal entrants returning
after Christmas visits to Mexico and Central America.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS offered Spanish language videos to broadcast systems in the
Caribbean and Latin America that warned potential illegal aliens that the
stepped-up border controls will make it harder to return to the US illegally
after holiday visits home.  The INS also said that it intends to prosecute
repeat violators of US immigration laws.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Mexican workers who viewed the 30-minute broadcast on December 20
doubted that it would deter them from returning to the US.  The broadcast is
scheduled to be repeated at least two more times.</tt><p>
<tt>The stepped-up border control efforts include an agreement to reimburse
local police forces for cooperating with the INS by, e.g., helping to transport
aliens apprehended.  The Border Patrol is being backed up by 350 members of the
Marine and Army units deployed under the military's Joint Task Force 6, which
has been helping to battle drug trafficking since 1988.  While the Army is
prohibited by law from performing immigration-related duties, the troops can
assist in operating night scopes, motion sensors and communications gear.
</tt><p>
<tt>National Guard units from California and Arizona will also assist the
Border Patrol.  The California Assembly, on a 41-32 vote on January 30, 1995,
approved the sending of the National Guard to the border.</tt><p>
<tt>Republican Presidential candidate Lamar Alexander on January 30, 1995
proposed that the Immigration and Naturalization Service be replaced with a new
branch of the armed forces to patrol America's borders.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican officials expressed their "deep concern" on January 12 about the
use of US military units at the border; several asserted that stepped-up border
enforcement could harm US-Mexico relations and increase human rights abuses.
Several Mexican officials said that the US did not consult with the Mexican
government before taking the action.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 14, Mexican lawmakers announced that they plan to ask the United
Nations to demand that the US stop using troops along the Mexican
border.</tt><p>
<tt>Many newspapers attributed the stepped-up border enforcement to
election-year politics.  For example, a Los Angeles Times editorial asserted
that the major reason for the stepped-up border enforcement was to garner
critical California votes.  The paper argued that it would have been better to
speed up naturalization to get votes.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has three special border control operations:  Operation
Hold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas; Operation Safeguard south of Tucson, Arizona;
and, Operation Gatekeeper, south of San Diego, California.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has 25,000, including 5,600 Border Patrol agents.  About 40 percent
of the Border Patrol agents are Hispanic. </tt><p>
<tt>On January 6, President Clinton signed legislation that raises the INS
annual budget from $2.1 billion in FY95 to $2.6 billion in FY96.  The INS is
planning to more than double the number of investigators assigned to enforcing
employer sanctions, from 320 to 704.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were about 6,000 INS investigations of employers for immigration
violations in FY95, down sharply from almost 15,000 in FY89.  The INS assessed
employers $4 million in fines in 1989, and $4.1 million in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The northern border states are reporting increased illegal immigration.  In
Idaho, the border chief reports that the number of apprehensions rose 11
percent from FY 1994 to FY 1995.  The Border Patrol reports that most illegal
aliens are apprehended in the Twin Falls area, and  are attracted there  by
agricultural jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>Some critics have noted that the Clinton Administration's approach to
sanctions enforcement seems to be targeting illegal workers rather than their
employers.  They see INS operations such as Southpaw as similar to early 1980s
Operation Jobs, which removed aliens from jobs that were to be filled by US
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS apprehended 1.3 million aliens in FY95, up from 1.1 million in
FY94, including 525,000 aliens in between October 1994 and November 1995 in the
San Diego sector, and 227,000 in the southern Arizona sector. About half of
those apprehended were caught at least once before.</tt><p>
<tt>A review of the mission of the inland California checkpoints, which have
come under fire regularly because of budget considerations, is now being
conducted.  The INS is now looking at a plan to open the checkpoint in San
Clemente 24 hours a day.  Over 30,000 illegal immigrants were captured at the
San Clemente checkpoint in FY 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced at the end of December 1995 that it had deported 52,000
illegal aliens, including 32,000 criminal aliens who were finishing US jail
sentences.  These data do not include aliens who leave the US voluntarily after
being apprehended:  about 98 percent of the 1.3 million aliens apprehended
annually at the southern border, and about 90 percent of the 20,000 to 30,000
aliens apprehended at US work sites, return to their native countries
voluntarily, without formal deportation proceedings.  </tt><p>
<tt>On January 30, California Governor Pete Wilson had an illegal immigrant
delivered to an INS facility in El Centro, California to protest the refusal of
the federal government to supply sufficient federal funding for illegal
immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>Wilson wants the federal government to take custody of the inmate to "show
good faith" that it will pay for the 20,000 criminal illegal aliens in
California prisons.  The INS refused to accept the convicted Mexican drug
dealer, saying it is only responsible for holding aliens who are being
deported, not those serving sentences for crimes committed in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>California got $33 million in 1994-95 from the federal government to help
offset what the state claims is a $400 million annual tab for confining illegal
aliens.  About $30 million is expected in 1995-96.</tt><p>
<tt>The California State Attorney General filed documents in federal court on
January 31 claiming it could exclude illegal aliens from 23 programs ranging
from state-funded abortion to child abuse prevention.  The state is asking the
judge to rule on whether these programs can deny benefits to illegal aliens.
The programs were identified as wholly state-funded programs.  The federal
court judge ruled on November 20 that California could legally deny benefits to
undocumented immigrants under Prop. 187, if the state could prove that the
programs were wholly state funded.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 4, 1996, the INS released its report card on asylum reforms
implemented one year earlier.  The number of new asylum claims filed fell
sharply, from 122,589 in 1994 to 53,255 in 1995.  The number of cases handled
by the INS more than doubled, to 126,200.  </tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meisser attributes the drop in asylum applicants to
the reforms that limit the availability of work permits and require applicants
to come in person to an INS office to learn whether their application was
accepted or rejected.  If it is rejected, the asylum applicant is placed
immediately in deportation proceedings.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a backlog of about 460,000 asylum applications, including about
250,000 so-called ABC cases filed by Central Americans, and entitled to special
consideration because of 1980s policies that denied virtually all claims from
Salvadorans.  The Salvadoran government has urged all of its nationals in the
US who can to apply for asylum under the ABC rules so that they can remain in
the US and send remittances to El Salvador (see story below).</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Immigrant
Integration</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Commission on Immigration Reform believes that the United States should
continue to be a country of immigration, but that the US must worry about
whether newcomers arriving today are integrating into American society.
According to the CIR, the melting pot works, in the sense that turn of the
century German and Italian immigrants become Americans committed to democratic
ideals.  The CIR endorsed "Americanization," or immigrants accepting the core
civic culture of the US, and becoming naturalized US citizens.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>There is no single definition of Americanization, but many of those
worried about the immigrants arriving today focus on the tendency of many
recent arrivals not to speak English and not to naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Language in the work place, in schools, and in government has become a
flashpoint.  In San Francisco, a closely-divided federal appeals court on
October 5, 1995 struck down Arizona's<b> </b>official English law on a 6-5
vote.  </tt><p>
<tt>Arizona is one of 22 states that has made English language the language to
be used<b> </b>exclusively in conducting state business.  The Arizona case
involved a state insurance worker who challenged the law because, she said, she
had to speak Spanish to her clients, and she wanted to prepare reports in
Spanish so that clients could understand her decisions.  Her supervisor,
however, could not read Spanish.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The majority opinion referred to the "importance of establishing a
common bond and a common language [in a] diverse and pluralistic society," but
said<b> </b>that such a society also requires a "tradition of tolerance."
</tt><p>
<tt>California approved Prop. 63 in 1986, which called for the preservation of
English as the state's "common language," while Arizona's initiative was more
specific, requiring that state and local governments "act in English and in no
other language." </tt><p>
<tt>There is a continuing debate over how fast immigrants and their children
are learning English, and how to teach them English.  A study of immigrant
children ages five to 14 in 1980 found that, by 1990, the percentage who spoke
English well increased from 33 to 70 percent.  The USC mobility study, released
November 3, 1995, tracked immigrants who arrived in the 1970s who were counted
in both the 1980 and 1990 censuses.  </tt><p>
<tt>One central finding of the study is that non-Latino immigrants who arrived
in the 1970s learned English and increased their incomes faster than Latino
immigrants.  For example, among men 25 to 34 in 1980, the proportion of Asian
men who "spoke English well" rose from 39 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in
1990, versus 13 to 21 percent among Latino men.  The percentage of Asian men
with incomes below poverty level fell from 17 to six percent, while for
Latinos, the poverty rate fell from 21 to 18 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The USC study defined assimilation as "adjustment, integration, and
advancement over time," and used five variables as indicators of
assimilation--English proficiency, US citizenship, occupational mobility,
average personal income, and poverty rates.</tt><p>
<tt>A study to be released in February by George Mason University professors
finds that students first taught in their own language do better than those
immersed quickly in English.  The researchers found that the most effective
program, which is also the least found in US schools, is two-way immersion
classes where English speaking students and foreign-language speaking students
learn each other's languages together. </tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the study say that it is not reflective of what goes on in
California classrooms where native-language instruction keeps students from
becoming proficient in English.  In California, there are 1.2 million students
who do not speak English.  One linguistics' professor says that if a student is
not transferred out of bilingual education by sixth or seventh grade will not
succeed academically. </tt><p>
<tt>In some areas, special schools have been established to teach immigrant
children.  In New York, a $400,000 Newcomers School in the borough of Queens,
opened to serve up to 1,000 high school students who have been in the US less
than one year.  The school plans to teach students in their own language and in
English, and to provide a variety of services to parents.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 400 students from more than 40 countries enrolled in
the program.  Students are placed in classes based on their fluency in English,
not by age or nationality.  Students are taught primarily in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The theory is that immigrants have a better chance of learn English and
assimilating into American society if they first learn in an educational
setting that serves their specified needs.  Students are expected to be
enrolled in the Newcomer School for a year or longer.  </tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the program say that segregating the immigrants may stigmatize
them and that it may violate federal civil rights law.  The New York Civil
Rights Coalition recently filed a complaint with the US Department of Education
against Newcomer High because they were basing admission solely on national
origin. </tt><p>
<tt>The New York Times blasted bilingual education in New York City in an
editorial that argued that the practice of teaching foreign-born students in
their native language in all subjects, and offering only one class each day in
English, was putting such students in a "prison" from which they will find it
difficult to escape.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of "limited English proficient" students in New York City has
almost doubled from 85,000 in 1986-87 to 154,000 in 1993-94.  The increase,
according to the editorial, came about because a bilingual education
bureaucracy that assigns students to bilingual classes even when their parents
prefer them in regular classes.</tt><p>
<tt>One University of California-Santa Barbara professor who has studied
newcomer schools says that it is uncertain how effective these type of schools
are because the students are not tracked after they leave the school.  Also,
the immigrant-only schools have high profiles and are susceptible to public
backlash.  She says that the schools should be considered transitional and that
students should not spend more than one year in them. </tt><p>
<tt>Economist Lowell Gallaway estimates that households headed by someone who
spoke poor or no English in 1989 earned $7,400 less than households headed by
someone who spoke good English.  According to Gallaway, households headed by
foreign-born persons received in 1995 on average $5,600 in federal welfare
assistance, $200 more than the average $5,400 received by US-born household
heads.</tt><p>
<tt>The bilingual education studies each vary in their findings, and that is
attributed by some to the time frame which the researchers used.  The George
Mason study had a long term time frame which spanned from elementary school to
high school.  The New York study tried to test whether its students could test
out of bilingual education within three years.  </tt><p>
<tt>One finding of the George Mason study was that students family background
was an important factor in academic success.  Students with the best-educated
parents and the most schooling before coming to the US did better than those
whose parents are not as well educated or who had little education in their
native country.  </tt><p>

Continue to Increase</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Over one million foreigners applied to become naturalized US citizens in
1995, up from 543,353 in 1994, 522,298 in 1993, and 342,269 in 1992.  The
number of applications for naturalization is expected to be even larger in 1996
because the 1.2 million illegal aliens who became immigrants under the SAW
program will be eligible to naturalize.  In the northwestern US, SAWs are
expected to be half or more of the applicants for naturalization.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans were about 30 percent of the five million foreigners recognized as
immigrants in the past five years and, historically, only 17 percent of Mexican
immigrants, but 41 percent of all immigrants, have become naturalized US
citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 2.5 to three million Mexican nationals in the US who could apply
to be US citizens.  Over half live and work in California, 11 percent are in
Texas, and 12 percent are in Florida and Arizona. </tt><p>
<tt>There is a debate among political observers about the effects of large
numbers of naturalizations on US politics. <b> </b>One view is that many
immigrants  are naturalizing to preserve their access to benefits and in
reaction to Prop. 187 in California,<b> </b>and, therefore, the most
newly-naturalized immigrants can be expected to vote Democratic.  </tt><p>
<tt>Other observers point out, however, that immigrants, especially Latino
immigrants, live in districts that are already represented by Latino or Black
Democrats, and that the effect of naturalizations is to increase the number of
votes in these districts, and perhaps to replace Blacks with Hispanics, but not
to change the party representing the district.</tt><p>
<tt>A federal appeals court in November 1995 ruled that aliens cannot be
deported from the US because of their political activities in the US.  When
seven Palestinians on student visas were arrested in 1987, the INS tried to
deport them for membership in a offshoot of the PLO, even though none of the
seven had been found guilty of a terrorist act.  The appeals court ruled that
aliens have the same rights of free speech as US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The State Department announced that the 1996 immigrant visa lottery will
permit up to 55,000 foreigners--almost half from Europe--to apply for US
immigrant status.  Applications for the so-called "diversity lottery" will be
accepted between February 12 and March 12, 1996 from all but 11 foreign
countries--only nationals of countries that have sent 50,000 or more immigrants
to the US over the past five years are ineligible.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, some 4.5 million applications for green cards were submitted in
the lottery.</tt><p>
<tt>Many applicants are illegal aliens living in the US who want to legalize
their status.  When Mayor Giuliani announced his support for immigration on
January 30, and praised the lottery, more than 1000 immigrants who understood
that the INS was giving out greencards descended on INS offices in New York
City. </tt><p>
<tt>The upsurge in naturalization is expected to renew the debate over whether
foreign-born or US born residents are most dependent on welfare.  Under the
Senate version of welfare reform, the sponsors' income would be attributed to
immigrants applying for federal assistance for five years after arrival and, in
the case of some programs, until the immigrant had worked and paid taxes for
ten years, even if the immigrant had become a naturalized US citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>A working paper by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that immigration
depressed the wages of US-born high school dropouts by as much as four percent
during the 1980s, accounting for about half of the decline in that group's real
wages. </tt><p>
<tt>A recent report by published in the American Journal of Public Health by
UCLA public health researchers found that immigrants are more likely to be
victims of homicide than people born in the US.  From 1969-1992, immigrants
were victims in 23 percent of homicide in the California, even though they
represent only 17 percent of the population.  Some researchers think that one
possible reason for the higher risk is that they live in areas marked by high
rates of poverty. </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 2.6 million Americans living overseas, plus 600,000
military and government employees and their dependents stationed overseas.
About one million Americans live in Mexico, Canada, and the UK, and over
100,000 live in each of three other countries:  Germany, Israel, and
Italy.</tt><p>
<tt>Increasingly, US companies are using local rather than expatriate workers
to save costs.  The US State department estimates that it costs about $230,000
to station one mid-level American overseas; $60,000 for salary, $75,000 for
operating expenses, and $95,000 for overseas allowances.</tt><p>

<tt>Employers continue to criticize the US Department of Labor for proposing
changes in the H-1B program, which allows up to 65,000 "professionals" to enter
the US each year and work for up to six years.  The National Association of
Manufacturers sued DOL in April 1995 to protest changes in the regulations
governing the program, and in October 1995, DOL reissued the changed
regulations for comment.</tt><p>
<tt>NAM and other employers are protesting a regulation that requires the
development of an objective wage system for non-H-1B workers that would enable
a third party to calculate actual wages owed to H-1B workers, so that DOL can
check to determine whether H-1B workers are being paid as much as comparable
workers.  High-tech companies such as Microsoft and Motorola want to avoid
having to establish such a wage system.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the Senate immigration reform bill, S1394, employers would have to
pay a fee of 10 percent of the H-1B's annual compensation or $ 10,000,
whichever is greater, into an industry-specific training fund to prepare US
workers for the jobs that are being filled by foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a great deal of controversy over how easy to make study and work
in the US, especially for foreigners post-college education.  Many high-tech
companies argue that, since they compete in global labor markets, they need
access to the global labor market to hire the best and brightest scientists and
engineers.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers are prohibited from firing workers in order to replace them with
cheaper labor.  However, companies get around the law by out-sourcing--laying
off their own workers, and having the work done by a subcontractor who in turn,
hires foreign labor.</tt><p>
<tt>US workers at Sea-Land Services in New Jersey, for example, claim they were
fired and replaced by lower paid foreign workers from the Philippines.
Sea-Land says that laid off the US workers and switched to a subcontractor for
programming services for cost reasons.  The US workers were being paid about
$50,000 a year.</tt><p>
<tt>Colorado's ski industry has an estimated 86,000 workers for the November
through March season, and unskilled hotel, restaurant, and ski operator
workers, who typically earn $7 per hour or more, are increasingly foreigners.
Scarce and expensive housing in the resort areas may be partially to
blame--many workers live in trailers that are wall-to-wall mattresses.</tt><p>
<tt>The United States Department of Labor has certified local shortages of ski
instructors and motel janitors, allowing Colorado resorts to import workers on
temporary visas.  The estimated number of illegal aliens in Colorado has grown
to about 22,000 in 1995, up from 17,500 in 1992.  In December 1995, the INS
apprehended 45 illegal workers at 12 businesses in ski country.</tt><p>
<tt>Some critics fault ski operators for thinking more about million dollar
condos than housing for employees.  In December, 1995 there were a record 156
homes priced at $1 million or more for sale in Aspen.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Alien
Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The January 1996 Report of the Presidential Initiative to Deter Alien
Smuggling recommended that all nations pass laws that make alien smuggling a
crime.  The report distinguished between countries of origin, transit
countries, and destination countries.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the report, smuggling fees for transport to the US range from
$200 to $300 for Central Americans to $35,000 for Chinese.  In most cases, the
alien being smuggled pays a small up-front fee, with the balance paid by
relatives already abroad once the alien reaches his destination.  Most alien
smuggling rings are ethnically-based, and many who have knowledge of smuggling
see it as a "victimless" crime.</tt><p>
<tt>The interagency task force report on alien smuggling prompted a review of
estimates of how many aliens are smuggled into the US.  Then-CIA director James
Woolsey testified in 1994 that 100,000 Chinese were illegally smuggled into the
US at a cost of $25,000 to $35,000 each, generating over $3 billion annually.
In some cases, the Chinese being smuggled to the US by so-called triads arrive
directly with false documents; in other cases, they are taken by ship to
Central America, and then come overland to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Alien smuggling is not a crime in most of the Central American countries
through which Asians transit--many smugglers operate openly as travel agents--
so that the worst that happens to smugglers is that the aliens are taken
away.</tt><p>
<tt>The report says that alien smuggling is facilitated by "staggering levels
of official corruption."  Several Central American officials have lost their
jobs for auctioning off consulate jobs in Hong Kong and Taipei, places where
visas to visit Central American nations are distributed that allow Chinese to
leave their country by airplane for Central America.  There are believed to be
50 gangs, many based in Taiwan, that smuggle Chinese to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Two high ranking immigration officials were fired in Uruguay after being
implicated in smuggling Chinese immigrants to Uruguay and then to Argentina,
where they were turned over to employers or pimps. The smuggling network
received about $5,000 for each person sent to Argentina.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS claims that alien smuggling has gotten so lucrative that drug
smugglers have been switching to people smuggling.  A University of Bangkok
study recently reported that alien smuggling generates $3.2 billion annually in
Thailand alone, a figure based on an estimate of the number of Thai women
smuggled to Japan, Germany and Taiwan for prostitution.</tt><p>

<tt>In April 1993, about 10 percent of US residents holding Bachelor's degrees
in science and engineering, and seven percent of non-science and engineering<b>
</b>BAs<b>,</b> were foreign born, as were 23 percent of the science and
engineering<b> </b>PhDs, and 12 percent of the non- science and engineering<b>
</b>PhDs.  The share of foreign-born PhDs was highest in engineering (40
percent), math and computer science (33 percent) and physics, chemistry, and
economics (31, 26, and 24 percent).  About 55 percent of the immigrants with
PhDs in science and engineering are naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Most US residents with PhDs in most major fields of study were born in the
US.  Many foreign born scientists were educated abroad and immigrated after
graduation--one-third of the foreign-born PhDs in science and engineering got
their doctorates abroad, and then moved to the US to work.</tt><p>
<tt>In January, a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences concluded
after a ten-month study that the US has too many doctors, and that the major
reason for the excess was the arrival in the US in 1993 of 23,000 doctors who
studied abroad, almost double the 12,000 foreign-trained doctors who arrived in
1988.  The US' 125 accredited medical schools graduate about 17,500 doctors
each year.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of doctors in the US has been growing --from 150 per 100,000
residents in 1970, to almost 250 per 100,000 today.  About one-fourth of the
661,000 doctors in the US were born abroad.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to some experts, the reason why more foreign-trained than
US-trained doctors are enrolled in US hospital residency programs is that the
US government pays hospitals about $150,000 for each doctor in training,
regardless of his/her nationality (MN, December 1995).  The panel recommended
reducing the number of residency slots, and giving preference to US-trained
doctors for the slots that remain.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Institute for International Education, there are about 1.5
million students enrolled in institutions of higher education outside their
country of citizenship around the world, including 450,000 foreign students in
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 60 percent of the foreign students with temporary F-visas in the US
are from Asia, and nine of the top 10 counties of origin are Asian.  According
to IIE, Japan sends more foreign students to the US than any other country,
followed by China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and
Thailand.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US universities where most foreign students enroll are Boston
University, University of Southern California, University of Wisconsin, New
York University, Ohio State University, and University of Texas.  About 60
percent are male.</tt><p>
<tt>According to IIE, about two-thirds of the foreign students in the US
finance their education privately; only one-sixth receive assistance from US
institutions.  IIE reports that only 1.2 percent of the foreign students are
supported primarily by the US government, primarily through the Fulbright
scholarship program.  </tt><p>
<tt>The GAO in November 1995 released a report that said 390,000 foreign-born
students received $662 million in Pell grants (maximum $2,400 per year) in
1992-93--these students were primarily legal immigrants who can continue to
live in the US.  In California, 120,500 immigrants received Pell grants, making
them one-third of the 369,000 recipients, in New York, 96,300 immigrant
recipients were 26 percent of the 364,000 Pell recipients, and in 30,200
immigrants were 16 percent of the 188,000 Pell grant recipients in the
state.</tt><p>
<tt>The welfare reform bill pending in Congress would require immigrant
students applying for federal education aid to report the income of their
sponsors, and to assume that the student has access to the sponsors' income
when determining eligibility for federal student aid.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been more stories about the dismal job market for new PhD
students.  Budget problems at many universities and the end of mandatory
retirement has reduced the number of new job openings, and new PhDs desperate
for work have led, by some estimates, to 40 percent of US college courses being
taught by part-time faculty.</tt><p>
<tt>The San-Jose Mercury News in December 1995 published a report that accused
the California State University system of not implementing the section of Prop.
187 that requires higher education institutions to deny admission to illegal
aliens.  There are believed to be at least 1,000 illegal aliens among CSU's
325,000 students; CSU said it sent hundreds of letters to suspected illegal
alien students, many of whom claim to be California residents to pay $1970
resident rather than $8,522 in out of state annual fees.</tt><p>

</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>Maquiladoras</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Mexico ran a trade surplus of $7.4 billion in 1995, versus a deficit of
$18.5 billion in 1994.  Exports were $80 billion, including $67 billion of
manufacturing goods, both from maquiladoras ($30 billion) and from
Mexican-owned factories.  Maquiladoras buy only about two percent of their
components in Mexico. </tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras are foreign-operated assembly plants, most along the US
border, that import components into Mexico, assemble them into products that
range from televisions to auto parts, and re-export from Mexico the finished
products--Mexican taxes are paid only on the value added by Mexican worker
assembly activities.</tt><p>
<tt>The maquiladora sector expanded in 1995 while domestic manufacturing
shrank, so that over 3,000 maquiladoras employed 743,000 workers at the end of
1995-- maquiladoras now provide about one-in-five Mexican manufacturing
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The value of the finished products exported from Mexican maquiladoras was
over $30 billion in 1995, or 34 percent of the total value of Mexican exports,
second only to oil.</tt><p>
<tt>The US in 1994 made a net $3.3 billion in new investment in Mexico,
including $2.4 billion in manufacturing.  About 40 percent of the new 1994
manufacturing investment was in vehicles.</tt><p>
<tt>In response to US pressures, the US has taken three steps that have the
effect of slowing the implementation of NAFTA--indefinitely postponing
cross-border trucking, shifting to a weekly measure of Mexican tomato imports,
and defining Florida winter vegetables as an "industry" so that growers there
can more easily petition for relief from injury.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's GDP shrank seven percent in 1995, and inflation was 53 percent.
Mexico denied rumors that it was going to raise its 15 percent value-added tax.
</tt><p>
<tt>Borrowers of up to one-third of the loans made in Mexico are not paying
interest on their loans.  Mexico has a banking crisis--money was lent for
buildings and other purposes that cannot be repaid, and the cost of rescuing
the banks could be equivalent to 12 percent of Mexican GDP (the Savings and
Loan crisis in the US cost about 3.5 percent of the GDP to clean up).</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican government expects to phase out subsidies in 1996 that keep the
price of tortillas at about 1.10 pesos per kilogram, or about seven US cents
per pound.  Mexicans eat about 10 million tons of corn tortillas each year, or
about 200 pounds per person--these tortillas currently cost about $14 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>In December 1994, the US and 33 other western Hemisphere nations met in
Miami for a Summit of the Americas that ended with a pledge to create a Free
Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.  Some 23 working groups have been
established to implement the summit's goals.</tt><p>
<tt>There were year-end protests in several areas of Mexico, with some rural
residents and members of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) protesting several ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
electoral victories in October, 1995.  For example, on January 3, 1996, police
evicted campesinos who had occupied the La Gloria ranch on the Pacific coast,
arresting about 25 PRD members.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>December 1995 interviews with a 750-person sample of the one million
Filipinos in California find that most speak English well and want to become US
citizens as soon as possible.  Even though 85 percent of those surveyed were
born abroad, virtually all said that they speak English well, and 74 percent
were naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Filipinos are so well integrated in California that there is no Filipino
counterpart to Korea town or Chinatown.  Over 90 percent of those polled said
that they were happy with life in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 85 percent of the Filipinos polled said that they had close ties to
the Philippines, and two-thirds reported that they sent money to the
Philippines.  Remittances are the number one source of foreign exchange for the
Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 1.4 million Filipinos counted in the 1990 Census, and their
number is expected to reach two million in the year 2000, making Filipinos the
largest Asian group in the US.  Over five percent of all immigrants to the US
since 1990--about 250,000 persons--were Filipinos.</tt><p>
<tt>Korean-Americans in Los Angeles coined the term 1.5er to refer to those
Korean-born immigrants raised in the US and caught between the first and second
generations of Koreans in America.  Most are young adults who came to the US as
children.  After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, they became active, speaking up
for their parents whose businesses suffered. </tt><p>
<tt>Many Koreans fled Los Angeles after the riots for nearby Orange County,
doubling the Korean population of around 40,000.  Los Angeles County still has
400,000 Koreans.   </tt><p>
<tt>The 1.5ers took on the tasks of helping out their community though work in
city, county and state government, health care, the legal system and politics.
Observers say the 1.5ers are full of passion and intellect.   They are
effective because they are bilingual and bisocial, bridging the gap between
Koreans and Americans. </tt><p>
<tt>In response to Congressional efforts to reduce legal and illegal
immigration, several Asian groups have formed organizations to lobby against
plans to reduce legal immigration and eliminate slots for extended family
members.</tt><p>
<tt>Asians are about four percent of the US population, but almost 40 percent
of recent immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration reform would eliminate the 23,400 slots available each year for
the married adult children of US citizens, and the 65,000 slots for the
brothers and sisters of US citizens.  About 70 percent of the 260,000 adult
children, and of the 1.6 million the brothers and sisters, on immigration
waiting lists are Asians.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Asian immigrants are well educated, and economically successful in the
US.  About 66 percent of recent immigrants from India have a college degree or
more, as do 46 percent of recent Filipino immigrants, and 42 percent of Chinese
immigrants.  Their education and earnings, some predict, could make Asian
immigrants formidable players in US politics, as exemplified by the successful
push to permit many of the 60,000 Chinese students and their family members in
the US in 1989 to become US immigrants in 1992.</tt><p>

<tt>Salvadoran legislators urged the 187,000 Salvadorans in the United
States<b> </b>who are in the so-called ABC program, scheduled to expire January
31, 1996, to apply for asylum so that they can stay in the US.  The Salvadoran
government opened 10 offices across the US in the Fall of 1995 to help
Salvadorans apply for asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The ABC program began in 1991, when the American Baptist Church charged US
authorities with unfair treatment of political asylum requests from thousands
of Salvadorans and Guatemalans.  Salvadorans who applied for Temporary
Protected Status or asylum in the US before 1990 are covered by the ABC
settlement.</tt><p>
<tt>The Salvadoran government's aim is to "guarantee that all Salvadorans who
want to stay in the United States do so legally and continue working."  El
Salvador officials estimate that in 1994, one million Salvadorans in the United
States sent $800 million back to their country, and that the figure could reach
$900 million in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>Applicants for asylum complete a seven-page form I-589.  Under proposed
immigration reforms, asylum applications would have to be filed within 30 days
of arriving in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on December 28, 1995 extended the Deferred Enforced Departure
status, and work authorization, of Salvadorans with ABC status who have applied
for asylum in the US, until April 30, 1996.  The INS has said there will be no
further extensions. </tt><p>
<tt>During El Salvador's civil war that ended in 1992, in which 75,000 were
killed, between 800,000 and one million Salvadorans migrated to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>El Salvador's GDP is $8 billion, and annual imports of $1.2 billion are
largely paid for with remittances--coffee, the number two export after labor,
generated $275 million in 1994.  In some regions, remittances are 60 percent of
local income.</tt><p>
<tt>Salvadoran President Armando Caldero'n Sol is trying to attract
maquiladoras to El Salvador--he says that he would like the country to become
"one big duty-free zone."  He denounced efforts to boycott retailers in the US
whose products are allegedly made under poor conditions in maquiladoras.
</tt><p>
<tt>In December 1995, US retailer Gap Inc. agreed to renew a contract with the
Taiwanese-owned Mandarin International maquila in El Salvador, if Mandarin
rehires 330 workers fired in June, 1995 for union activities.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 45,000 Guatemalans fled to southern Mexico in the 1980s to escape
fighting between the army and guerrillas, and 30,000 returned since a 1992
agreement between the Guatemalan government and guerrillas.  However, some
15,000 children--most with dual citizenship--were born in the camps, and the
Guatemalan population in southern Mexico is still 30,000.</tt><p>
<tt>Returning Guatemalans face problems, from continued fighting to the loss of
electricity to new ideas, such as using Spanish to bridge a multitude of Indian
languages.  As part of the 1992 agreement, the government has bought land for
returning farmers, but inflated land prices have raised from $2,000 to as much
as $20,000 the cost of land needed for subsistence farming.</tt><p>

<tt>France toughened its naturalization legislation in 1993 to require
foreigners born in France of foreign parents to apply for French citizenship
before reaching age 18, rather than receiving French citizenship
automatically.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, over half of the young foreigners 16 to 18 did not apply for
French citizenship, the first year the new law went into effect.  There were
about 80,000 foreign youth eligible to apply for citizenship in 1994, and about
41,000 did so, and 98 percent of the applications were approved.  Only 40
percent of those applying were of North African origin--most were of European
origin.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the law was to promote the integration of foreign youth by
making them consciously choose French nationality.</tt><p>
<tt>The Schengen open borders group of nations is expected to be extended to
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1996.  Iceland and Norway are
not EU members and thus cannot join Schengen, but they have pledged to
cooperate with Schengen members to facilitate travel.</tt><p>
<tt>Many hope that France will remove its border controls with Schengen member
countries on March 25, 1996, the first anniversary of Schengen's border free
implementation.</tt><p>
<tt>France has led the search for EU harmonization on immigration issues,
persuading EU member nations in November 1995 that persecution by
non-government agents does not entitle a person to asylum in Europe--cynics
asserted that France did not want to offer asylum to Algerians fleeing Islamic
terrorists.  Similarly, merely belonging to a banned group, such as an
anti-cleric organization in Iran, does not entitle a person to asylum--the
individual must show that he or she was personally subject to persecution by
the government.</tt><p>
<tt>About 309,000 foreigners applied for asylum in the 15-member EU in 1994,
when 44,000 persons were recognized as refugees, including some who had applied
before 1994, and 56,000 were granted some form of temporary protected status.
Temporary protected status is expected to continue to be more common in EU
welfare states because TPS foreigners are not usually eligible for extensive
welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In the US and Canada, by contrast, there were 170,000 asylum applications,
and 23,000 foreigners were recognized as refugees.  The US received 87 percent
of the asylum applications, and made 35 percent of North America's positive
asylum decisions.</tt><p>
<tt>A RPR Gaullist work party, composed of mayors, issued a policy paper on
January 25 that recommended that tourist visas should be granted only to
foreigners who could show a return ticket upon their arrival in France, be able
to prove that they earned the equivalent of France's minimum wage, have medical
insurance, and register within 24 hours at the mayor's office.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under these conditions, many visitors to France from Eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union, and North and West Africa would be barred.  The working
group proposed that mayors should have the right to make random inspections of
the accommodations of foreigners, refuse to issue residence certificates in
suspect cases, and demand the immediate expulsion of foreigners who violate the
conditions of their stay or present a threat to public order.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Europe reported on January 22 that the Paris police lock-ups
for foreigners about to be deported are substandard.  The detainees spend all
their time in cells with no opportunity for outdoor exercise. </tt><p>
<tt>The French government announced that it would henceforth recognize only one
spouse per marriage, thus ending a 1980s policy of tolerating polygamy among
African immigrants.  During the 1980s, additional wives were informally
admitted to France with the argument that immigrants were entitled to "normal"
family life.  There are an estimated 200,000 people living in polygamous
families in France.</tt><p>
<tt>Eric Raoult, the French urban policy/integration minister, announced plans
for 30 tax free zones to stimulate investment and job creation in suburban
areas with high concentrations of foreign youth.  The plans for tax exemptions
and new job creation efforts fulfill President Chirac's 1995 pledge to launch a
Marshall Plan for French suburbs, and the government has pledged about FF5
billion(about $1 billion).  The French government now spends about FF9 billion
on its urban policy.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Raoult, it is urgent that France act--more than 30 cars are
burned each evening in the suburbs of France.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC14">UK:
Deportation and Asylum</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Britain's decision to deport a Saudi dissident to Dominica in order to
avoid offending Saudi Arabia and jeopardizing British trade and jobs provoked a
storm of controversy in the British press.</tt><p>
<tt>The case was unusual because a British home minister explicitly said that
the reason for deporting the dissident was to preserve the trade relationship.
Since 1985, Saudi Arabia and the UK have had an oil-for-arms trade, in which BP
and Shell sell about 600,000 barrels of Saudi oil daily, and the proceeds are
used by Saudi Arabia to buy mostly British arms.  Some 400,000 people are
employed in the British defense industry.</tt><p>
<tt>A leading Dominican politician said that the deportation could cause civil
unrest on the Caribbean island and be blocked by the Parliament.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain's Trades Union Congress has joined employers in opposing the Home
Secretary's proposal to impose fines and criminal sanctions on employers who
knowingly hire illegal alien workers, arguing that sanctions will exacerbate
racism.</tt><p>
<tt>Criticism from churches and immigrant welfare groups about eliminating
welfare benefits for up to 13,000 asylum seekers persuaded the British
government to maintain benefits.  Originally planned to take effect on January
15, the new rules will not take effect until February 5, and no asylum seekers
will automatically lose benefits on that date.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government will allow continued welfare benefits for those asylum
seekers who have appealed against rejection since October.  As of February 8,
new asylum seekers who fail to make a claim as soon as they arrive on British
soil will lose their right to claim benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>The Labour Party launched a bid to block the new rules on January 23, but
they survived by a vote of  279 to 264.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new rules received support from the all-party Social Security
Committee, which says that the number of bogus asylum claims is a serious
problem.</tt><p>
<tt>The Home Office estimates that about 70 percent of all asylum claims are
made by people who enter the UK as tourists, students or businessmen.  The
British government allows 16 percent of asylum seekers "exceptional leave to
stay," usually for three years.  Prior to 1993, Britain granted asylum to about
35 percent of the applicants, but for the past several years only about four
percent have been granted asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>A British High Court judge ruled on January 19 that asylum-seekers are
entitled to have only one claim considered by immigration authorities before
being deported.  The ruling came in the case of a Nigerian student who asked
for reconsideration after his case was rejected.  The court ruled that the Home
Office did not need to consider new evidence about oppression in Nigeria, and
the fate of the student's father, who was deported to Nigeria and has not been
heard from since.  The lawyers for the student are expected to appeal.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 22, a Westminster conference entitled "London--A Safe Haven?"
examined how the government's proposed changes to immigration control, housing
entitlement and social security regulations will affect asylum seekers in the
capital.  During the conference, one Opposition MP said that the government
asylum plan is neither practical nor humane and is an "attempt to put race on
the election agenda." </tt><p>
<tt>The UN spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has said that
the proposed British Asylum and Immigration Bill would penalize genuine asylum
seekers.  A position paper by the UNHCR and sent to the Home Office says that
the UN recognizes and supports the efforts of governments to streamline their
procedures and to curtail abuse, but emphasizes that minimum standards of
procedural fairness must be maintained in the system from determining asylum
applications.  </tt><p>
<tt>It concludes: "UNHCR is concerned that the proposals currently before
Parliament focus on restricting access to asylum procedures in a way that may
make it just as difficult for genuine refugees to enter the process as it would
for fraudulent applicants." It goes on to warn that withdrawing welfare
benefits to many asylum seekers "would undoubtedly cause hardship to many
genuine applicants, including vulnerable individuals such as women and
children."</tt><p>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard spent three days in Pakistan to talk to the
government about trying to stem the flow of Pakistanis seeking political asylum
in Britain.  More than 2,000 Pakistanis apply for asylum in Britain every year.

Asylum and
Unemployment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Some 127,937 foreigners requested asylum in Germany in 1995, about the same
as the 127,210 who requested asylum in 1994, but down from 322,599 in 1993 and
438,191 in 1992.  About half of 1995's asylum applications came from two
countries--ex-Yugoslavia (33,000) and Turkey (25,000).</tt><p>
<tt>German authorities processed 200,000 asylum applications in 1995, and
granted asylum to nine percent or 18,000 applicants.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 18, ten asylum seekers were killed in a suspected arson attack
on a hostel that housed asylum seekers in Luebeck, prompting German President
Herzog to assert that stronger action must be taken against anti-foreign
movements to protect foreigners living in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>A Lebanese resident has been arrested for setting the fire.  </tt><p>
<tt>There have been 30 foreigners killed in firebombings in Germany since 1990,
including five Turks in a 1993 fire bombing in Solingen.</tt><p>
<tt>A poll of 2,000 Germans found that crime and unemployment topped the list
of German concerns, followed by environmental concerns and the extreme right.
Fear of "too many foreigners" was ninth on the list of 22 fears.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 218,000 ethnic Germans resettled in Germany in 1995, down from 223,000
in 1994.  There were 219,000 Aussiedler in 1993, 231,600 in 1992, 222,000 in
1991, and a peak 397,000 in 1990.  Virtually all of the 1995 Aussiedler came
from the ex-USSR.</tt><p>
<tt>Since July 1990, there has been an annual quota of 225,000 ethnic Germans
per year, and those wishing to resettle in Germany must apply outside Germany.
</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 1.8 million ethnic Germans in the ex-USSR in 1991, with 46
percent in Kazakhstan, and 44 percent in Russia.  Kazakhstan, with 17 million
people and a per capita GDP estimated to be $1600 in 1993, is poorer than
Russia, which has 149 million residents, and a per capita GDP of $2,300.
</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, Kazak has been made the official language, a factor that
encourages more ethnic Germans to leave, including some who have moved to
Russia--the number of ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan has fallen from about
828,000 in 1991 to 614,000 in 1994 .</tt><p>
<tt>On January 26, Germany announced that in July 1996 it would start sending
the 320,000 Bosnians who are now tolerated in Germany to Bosnia.  The first
wave of about 200,000 people should be repatriated by about the middle of 1997.
The UNHCR said that resettlement was premature.</tt><p>
<tt>About 30,000 of the Bosnians in Germany have applied for asylum.  Most of
the rest have six-month tolerance permits, but up to 40 percent have residence
permits valid for one to two years.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Christian Social Union on January 24 called for cuts in the payments to
Bosnian refugees and asylum seekers in Germany in order to safeguard the
Germany economy.  Bosnian refugees in Germany are estimated to cost the state
and local governments between $9 billion to 12 billion per year. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany declared the fight against unemployment to be the country's top
priority in 1996, after German unemployment reached almost four million or 10
percent of the labor force in December 1995, the highest level ever recorded.
In the 15-member EU, there are about 17.5 million unemployed workers, a rate of
10.6 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany's auto and steel union, IG Metall, pushed for an "Alliance for
Jobs" agreement with employers to restrain wage increases in exchange for
employers creating 330,000 new jobs.  According to government estimates, each
one percent wage increase costs German employers DM 18 billion, or $12
billion.</tt><p>
<tt>The employers group first recommended the alternative of a lower entry
level wage and more regional independence from national agreements but, with
government promises to lower payroll taxes, a tripartite deal was reached on
January 23 that will cut public spending from 50 to 40 percent of GDP and aim
to reduce unemployment by two million over the next five years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Workers who are paid less than DM 580 ($400) per month are exempt from
social security and unemployment taxes in Germany.  There are some 4.5 to six
million "580-mark jobs" in Germany, including as many as 1.5 million low-wage
jobs in private households, often filled by immigrant women.  The US, by
comparison, has about one million persons employed in the occupation of private
household help.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany had 9.4 million union members in 1995, down from a peak 12 million
in 1991.  The DGB operates on 12 percent of the dues of its 17-member unions,
and its budget will fall to DM300 million ($200 million) in 1996.  IG Metall,
with three million members, is the largest union in Germany, and one of the
largest unions in the world.</tt><p>
<tt>Union chiefs from Britain, Ireland and Germany met in Holland in
mid-January to plan a protest at Berlin's many construction sites about harsh
conditions for foreign workers.  The German construction union IG Bau estimates
that there are 30,000 unemployed German construction workers in the Berlin
area.  The German government has been unable to introduce the National Posted
Workers Directive, which would force firms to pay foreign construction workers
the same as locals.</tt><p>
<tt>A 1993 McKinsey report on productivity in manufacturing found that US
output per hour worked in 1990 was as high or higher than output per hour
worked in Germany in nine key industries, from metal working and steel, where
US and Germany output measures were equal, to beer, where German productivity
was less than half US levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The key to high productivity is designing products that are easy to
manufacture, and organizing workplaces to make products efficiently.  The
report recommended that industrial countries open their lagging manufacturing
sectors to import competition, and that they set up transplant operations
abroad in sectors with high productivity.</tt><p>
<tt>In a report said to be typical of how some medium-sized German companies
are coping with slower growth at home, German power engineering firm
Balcke-Durr bought an Indian firm to get engineers for DM 10 hourly, versus DM
130 or $90 per hour for a German engineer.  According to the company,
successful international bids for infrastructure costs must be able to do
engineering work for less than DM 50 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Rhineland Westphalian Institute for Economic Research
estimated that guest workers in 1991 paid about DM 30 billion($20 billion) in
taxes and insurance contributions, but claimed only DM 14 billion in
benefits.</tt><p>

<tt>Hungary, a country of 10 million, has the highest per capita income in
eastern Europe: $3,300 GDP per person per year in 1994, versus $1,100 in
neighboring Romania, with 23 million residents.  Hungary has also been
successful in attracting foreign investment--$8.5 billion since 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>One result is that there are a large numbers of Romanians working illegally
in Hungarian agriculture and construction--by some estimates, 50 percent of the
workers in these sectors are illegal aliens.  Under pressure from Hungarian
unions, the government is trying to crack down on illegal immigration, but the
crackdown is complicated by several factors, including the large informal
economy --an estimated 40 percent of Hungary's GDP is from the informal sector,
and the fact that Romanians can enter Hungary without visas and, if they find
jobs, they can usually obtain work permits.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hungary already has employer sanctions laws on the books, but they are
rarely enforced, especially in eastern Hungary.  The penalty for not obtaining
a work permit is a fine which amounts to twice the salary paid to the foreign
worker throughout the period that the employer did not have the permit.  The
fine is paid into the Hungarian Unemployment Fund.  In eastern Hungary, ethnic
Hungarians from Romania can enter fairly easily, and sometimes friends and
relatives help them to find jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Like Germany, Hungary is trying to tackle both the underground economy and
illegal immigration.  The trick is to bring the underground economy above
board, and curb illegal immigration, without further slowing down the
economy.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 8,000 to 10,000 Chinese are in Hungary, mostly retailers operating
in 30 markets.  In Budapest, there are two major Chinese markets, one of which
has 1,000 Chinese retailers.  The cheap prices of Chinese products make them
popular with Hungarians. </tt><p>
<tt>One Chinese businessman in Hungary says that 80 percent of the Chinese
retailers working in Hungary make between $100,000 to $200,000 a year-- ten
reportedly have $2 million annual incomes.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese community has 20 interest associations, established an
education foundation and opened an elementary school.  There are four Chinese
business papers in Hungary.  </tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 40,000 Chinese were in Hungary between 1989 and 1990, but the
number dropped in 1995 because of changes in visa requirements. </tt><p>
<tt>Hungary's immigration quota for 1996 is 2,000, the same as 1995.  In order
to apply for permanent residence status, a foreigner must live in Hungary
legally for at least three years.  Last year, only 118 foreigners were granted
permanent resident status. </tt><p>

<tt>Japan's unemployment rate hit its highest level on November 1995 since
1953, 3.4 percent, meaning that 3.3 million of Japan's 64 million workers are
jobless.  As one sign of the changed Japanese labor market, in 1990, there were
140 jobs available for every 100 persons seeking jobs; today, there are 60 jobs
available for each 100 applicants.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan has 3.2 million persons employed in agriculture, 14.6 million in
manufacturing, 15.5 million in services, 14.6 million in trade, and 6.8 million
in construction.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite rising unemployment and over 60,000 deportations a year, about
288,000 foreigners did not leave Japan even though their visas expired in 1995,
about the same number as in 1933, a boom year.  About 70 percent of the
apprehended foreigners had been in Japan one year or more, up from 30 percent
in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Most male illegal foreign workers are in construction or factory jobs and
many female illegal workers are hostesses or waitresses.  Many of the foreign
workers are used during periods when firms next extra help.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example one employer needed 10 extra workers for one day.  He pays a
broker 13,000 yen per day for each worker (about $120) and the broker pays the
illegal foreign worker 8,000 yen (about $75).  Many of the brokers are also the
foreign workers' landlords.</tt><p>
<tt>Japanese firms are beginning to restructure the way that US firms did in
the 1980s, threatening traditions such as lifetime employment and hefty
bonuses.  In Japan, wages are about 70 percent of total pay, bonuses 25
percent, and overtime five percent.  Bonuses tend to be adjusted to reflect the
firm's profitability.</tt><p>
<tt>An earthquake relief organization has written a book that details how
foreign workers are excluded in Japanese society.  The Osaka-base Foreigners
Earthquake Information Center was formed after the Kobe earthquake to help
non-Japanese speaking foreign quake victims.  </tt><p>
<tt>It recommends that Japan treat foreigners as members of the community,
rather than viewing them as temporary visitors.  The center, re-named the
Center for Multicultural Information and Assistance, is an all-volunteer
organization that assists non-Japanese speaking foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>In Iran, two men were arrested for taking $266,000 from 45 Iranians by
promising to get them illegally into Japan.  The Iranians paid about $600 each
to be flown to Malaysia, where they were abandoned rather than given the
tourist visas for Japan that they expected.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the National Police Agency, "Japan's Foreigner Problem and
Policies for Dealing with It," concluded that foreigners, who are nine-tenths
of one percent of the population, are 2.3 percent of the persons arrested for
criminal offenses.</tt><p>

<tt>Human resource ministers from the 18-APEC member nations approved a draft
statement January 11 that calls for sharing labor market information,
standardizing skills qualifications, and promoting the mutual recognition of
skills qualifications and easing the mobility of workers through sharing labor
market information on skills, wages and working conditions.  The conference did
not address what to with the millions of overseas workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines, host of APEC in 1996, and several other labor exporting
nations had hoped that APEC might make a general statement in support of freer
labor mobility, much as the OECD encouraged labor migration in western Europe
in the 1950s and 1960s.  This might have been expressed as pledges to share
information on job and worker availability and to protect foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>However, labor importing nations fearful of massive unskilled immigration
limited the encouragement of labor migration to "qualified persons," and
Australia explained that it already facilitated such migration.  The ministers
discussed the possibility of future free flows of qualified workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Human Resources minister came closest to asserting the need
for an APEC-wide labor market when he said that APEC members "must be prepared
to facilitate movement of skills and workers across national boundaries."
Philippine President Ramos said that such a regional labor market "would be
more conducive both to better protection of workers and to expand opportunities
for their gainful employment."</tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be debate over whether Asia's rapid economic growth over
the past two decades was due more to one-time gains from mobilizing resources,
and thus cannot be sustained, or whether it was due to productivity increases.
Growth accounting skeptics of the "East Asian Miracle" emphasize the rapid
increases in labor and physical capital in Korea and Taiwan--they argue that
the miracle was based on perspiration, not productivity. </tt><p>

Internal Migrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Are migrant workers China's answer to inequality or a threat to its
stability?  There are 70 million (Ministry of Agriculture estimate) to 100
million (media estimate) people living away from the place where they are
registered, and thus generally unable to obtain subsidized housing and
food.</tt><p>
<tt>About 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion people live in rural areas, where
household incomes average about $225 per year, versus $425 in urban areas.  An
estimated 150 million rural workers--one third of the rural labor force of 450
million--is unemployed or underemployed.  Most of China's 25 million
construction workers are migrants from the countryside.</tt><p>
<tt>Near Shenzhen, 500 migrant construction workers in December burned the
local communist party headquarters to protest police harassment.  Beginning in
1996, persons wishing to leave their registered residence for more than one
month must obtain a temporary residence permit for their destination; employers
who hire migrants who do not have such permits can be fined 1000 yuan ($120), a
relatively small fine for construction workers who earn about $150 per
month.</tt><p>
<tt>The inequality that prompts migration also fuels social tension.  According
to the World Bank, the 1978 agricultural reforms lifted 170 million Chinese
over the "absolute poverty" line, currently $43 per person per year.  But most
of those helped by the agricultural reforms were helped between 1978 and 1984;
since then, the rural poor trapped in backwater areas see only one route to
opportunity:  internal migration.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the government restricts rural-urban migration, there could be
rebellions in poor areas.  According to one Chinese analyst, economic
differences between the North and South led to the US Civil War, and he urged
the government to redirect foreign investment away from coastal areas to reduce
poverty.</tt><p>
<tt>There are reported to be three million migrant workers employed in
Shanghai, a city of 15 million at the mouth of the Yangtze River with 2,000
construction sites.  </tt><p>
<tt>At the worksites that employ local and internal migrant workers, there are
frequent clashes between employers and workers.  In the first half of 1995,
there were about 13,000 labor disputes referred to the arbitration committees
established by China's labor law, which went into effect in January 1995.
</tt><p>
<tt>Officials note that many Chinese employers fail to provide workers with
contracts, as required, so that the workers can be fired at will.  Some of the
disputes involved sexual harassment and other practices, such as having workers
kneel before supervisors as punishment.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the investigations of labor disputes involve foreign-owned firms,
which account for 44 percent of the jobs in the Beijing area, versus 25 percent
for state-owned firms, and 31 percent for other local entities, such as
collectives.  However, over half of the job applicants in Beijing reportedly
want to work for foreign-owned firms because they pay higher wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese border police captured over 7,000 Chinese who were attempting to
make illegal exits in 1995.  The police claim that they caught the majority of
people trying to leave from the coastal provinces of Fujian, Shandong and
Liaoning.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 29, China announced new regulations to regulate what it says is
an annual influx of 70,000 foreign workers.  The foreign, public security,
labor and trade ministries outlined a three-step process in which foreigners
seeking jobs in China must get work permit prior to being granted work visas.
Unskilled foreign workers are banned.</tt><p>
<tt>China is preparing for the mass movement of 152 million people who return
home every year for the Lunar New Year, February 19.  The Chinese government
has urged all regional government to keep at least 60 percent of their migrant
workers in the factories before and after the Spring Festival, to help ease the
strain on transportation.  Officials and businessmen say the government
directive will be very difficult to enforce.  </tt><p>
<tt>China has demanded that Britain take responsibility of the Vietnamese boat
people because they have the responsibility to solve the problem created when
they permitted Hong Kong to become a port of first asylum 16 years ago.  The
British government says that the problem will become Hong Kong's when authority
is turned over in 1997. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Vietnam said in January that it was ready to accept up to 9,000 of the
37,000 Vietnamese in camps in southeast Asia, including 21,000 in Hong Kong.
Vietnam takes the names of those in camps, and checks to ensure that they are
Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR plan launched a funding appeal in Bangkok on January 14 to raise
$30 million to carry the Comprehensive Plan of Action to return the Vietnamese
in camps to Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>The governments of Vietnam and the Philippines have agreed to a program to
repatriate about 2,500 Vietnamese nationals housed in a refugee camp.  Starting
in March, the Philippine government will start an "orderly return program."
The UNHCR, which stopped funding the refugee camp in December, will cover the
transport costs as long as the refugees are returned without resistance.
Officials will try to convince the Vietnamese that they should not fear
retribution when they are returned to Vietnam, and should thus go voluntarily.
</tt><p>
<tt>In Malaysia, the UNHCR issued passports to about 2,000 Vietnamese illegal
immigrants housed in a Sungai Besi detention center outside Kuala Lumpur.  The
repatriation program is expected to be finished by the end of June.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government is anxious to repatriate the boat people after a
riot on January 18.  During the riot, the refugees burned down two living
quarters. One refugee was killed, and 23 people were injured.  The incident
began after refugees refused to allow a routine police inspection of the camp.
Afterwards, the police found a cache of weapons.  This was the third riot in a
year at the camp.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are two other plans to dealing with the remaining Vietnamese.  The US
is seeking to have boat people induced to return to Vietnam, where they would
be screened by State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service
officers charged with determining whether the returnees were likely to face
persecution.  The second proposal is that of Rep Chris Smith(R-NJ), who
persuaded the House to include funds in a bill to resettle up to 18,000
Vietnamese in America.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam says it will stick to its plan to repatriate 3,600 people each
month. </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam's growth, which was about 9.5 percent in 1995, is strikingly
uneven.  In the region around Ho Chi Minh City, growth averaged about 17.5
percent from 1990-1993, but in the south central coastal area, the economy grew
only 1.7 percent.  Vietnamese economists claim the annual per capita income in
Ho Chi Minh City is $900, versus $120 in the poorer regions of the
country.</tt><p>

57,159.  Their total salaries amounted to about $200 million.  By nationality,
South Koreans were on top, followed by Japanese, then Taiwanese.  The rise of
the number of Korean workers is attributed to an increase in Korean investment
in Indonesia. </tt><p>
<tt>Concerned about the number of foreign workers, the Indonesia government
plans to find out how many skilled Indonesians and professionals are available.
The government is also planning increased job training and employment centers.
</tt><p>

Indonesia maids working in Malaysia.  Effective January 1, RM2,000 (about $800)

<tt>"Being sold as pigs" is how the Chinese referred to labor recruitment in
the 19th century.  Today, with Hong Kong booming, and many Chinese migrating in
search of jobs, Hong Kong is now becoming the primary destination for Chinese
migrant workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong has labor laws to protect foreign workers, but labor contractors
have devised ways to evade them. </tt><p>
<tt>Some sub-contractors have won construction jobs with low bids, making their
profits by paying workers less than the minimum wage.  Many workers imported
for jobs also got substandard food and accommodation.  Since many migrants
borrow money to pay the labor contractor, they put up with the abusive
conditions until the debt is repaid. </tt><p>
<tt>Some Chinese construction workers, with two-year contracts, were dismissed
early.  Hong Kong law does not allow them to seek alternative employment so
they must leave within two weeks after dismissal.  This same law applies to
maids, who have been trying to get the rule amended. </tt><p>
<tt>There is currently a government investigation into allegations that foreign
construction workers at the new Hong Kong airport are having illegal deductions
made from their wages.  On January 12, 1995, some 239 mainland workers who were
fired from airport construction jobs agreed to accept $5,000 each to end their
dispute.  The workers argued that they had  bought their jobs for about $30,000
each from a subcontractor, and should get this fee back because they were
terminated early. </tt><p>
<tt>One restaurant worker was paid only half the salary stated in the worker's
contract approved by the labor authorities.  The contractor was convicted
supplying false information on an employment contract, and given a one-month
suspended sentence and $10,000 fine.  </tt><p>
<tt>The worker had been promised $2,500 per month minus food and lodging, but
was paid only $330 per month after deductions.</tt><p>

<tt>The Philippine government persuaded the UN General Assembly to poll its
185-member nations to determine whether the UN should convene a summit meeting
on international migration in Manila.  However, most of the nations contacted
by the UN opposed a migration summit, including the 15-nation EU, which argued
that international summits are too expensive and that, in any event, there was
little basis for positive recommendations that could come out of a migration
summit.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1995, the UN decided not to hold a migration summit, but to ask
the ILO to coordinate a meeting of UN agencies that deal with migration.</tt><p>
<tt>As of Fall, 1995, 17 countries had ratified ILO Convention 143 on the
protection of migrant workers, and five signed the UN Convention on migrant
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Turkish president of the International Chamber of Commerce asserted in
January that the industrial nations will eventually have to open themselves to
workers from developing nations.  According to Rahmi Koc, "if capital is
allowed to move freely...labor cannot remain static."  Free labor movement,
according to Koc, is inevitable.</tt><p>
<tt>Some believe that migration patterns in the 21st century will be different
from those of the 19th and 20th century.  In the past, it was easy for
unskilled workers to cross the Atlantic and begin anew.  In the 21st century,
the globalization of business promises to make it easier for professionals to
cross borders for temporary or permanent employment, and perhaps harder for
unskilled workers to work legally, or to settle, in the richer countries to
which they want to migrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The 30 fastest-growing "emerging economies" of Latin America, Asia, and
Eastern Europe  are expected to attract about $175 billion in private foreign
investment in 1996, about the same as 1995.  About half of this private
investment will be to Asia.  Official government and international organization
lending will provide a net $11 billion to these economies.</tt><p>

<tt>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has started to enforce a law which says that
only foreigners earning 3,000 dirhams monthly or more ($817) and receiving free
housing, or more than 4,000 dirhams without housing, can bring a wife, sons
aged up to 18 years, and unmarried daughters into the UAE.  Foreigners earning
at least 6,000 dirhams ($1,634) monthly can employ a foreign maid as long as
they pay the government an annual fee equivalent to her annual salary-- maids
must earn at least 400 dirhams ($110) a month.</tt><p>
<tt>All foreigners working in the UAE must have a local sponsor.  The country
has eased the rules on the number of foreigners eligible to sponsor residence
visas for their families.  For the first time, foreign women professionals can
sponsor their families and housemaids.  </tt><p>
<tt>The UAE has about 2.4 million residents, of whom 75 to 80  percent are
foreigners.  Males outnumber females two to one.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia announced that foreign workers in the kingdom transferred
SR38.1 billion in the first nine months of 1995 compared with SR 43.7 billion
in the first nine months of 1994.  The Saudi government wants to create more
employment opportunities for its college graduates, especially because of the
increase of 500,000 in labor visas given in 1995.  The number of expatriates in
the private sector has doubled in the past five years according to the
government.  There are now about 6.2 million foreigners from 190 countries in
Saudi Arabia.  Four million are employed and the remainder are dependents.
</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait is attempted to reduce the number of foreign employees in government
from the current 46 percent to 35 percent.  The Kuwaiti government plans to do
this by returning hiring authority from individual ministries to the Employees
Diwan, the department in charge of ministry workers.  Five years ago the
Kuwaiti Cabinet decreed that foreigners should occupy only 35 percent of
government jobs, but the country has been unable to meet that goal.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bahrain has a national unemployed rate of 1.8 percent or about 4,409
people, out of an estimated work force of 239,000.  There are about 130,000
foreign workers among 550,000 residents.  </tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, Bahrain raised its work permit fees for foreigners and the
funds raised will go to job training for nationals.  Baluchis from Pakistan and
Indians dominate Bahrain's public security force, which is responsible for

<tt>India and Nepal have a free migration agreement, and some one million
Nepalese live in Bombay.  There are also thousands of Bangladeshis in India,
many of whom stayed after Pakistan was partitioned in 1971.  Some Indian
politicians consider the Bangladeshis to be illegal immigrants, and want them
expelled.</tt><p>
<tt>More than 300 Bhutanese refugees demonstrated at the Indian-Nepal border on
January 24.  The Bhutanese want Indian officials to allow them to proceed to
their homeland to press for democratic reforms and early repatriation for their
countrymen living at camps in Nepal.  The protesters also demanded the release
of 150 refugees detained by Indian police in west Bengal on January 17.  They
were detained after they tried to march to Bhutan through West Bengal from
camps in Nepal.  </tt><p>
<tt>The protesting refugees had planned to travel through India and into Bhutan
to appeal to Bhutan's king to allow them back into the country.  Indian police
on January 23 erected barricades on a bridge over the Mechi River, which
divides Nepal and India, and the marchers subsequently set up camp on the
Nepalese side of the border.  </tt><p>
<tt>The refugees are staying in Nepal, where they are being assisted by the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees.  Five years ago they were allowed to travel
across India unhindered after they were evicted from their homes. </tt><p>

<tt>US Department of Labor.  1995.  BLS Projections to 2005.  Monthly Labor
Review.  Vol 118, No 11.  November.</tt><p>
<tt>This issue presents the BLS's biennial projections.  The US in 1994 had a
labor force in 1994 of 131 million; the labor force is expected to grow by 16
million to 147 million in 2005.  In 2005, about 48 percent of US workers are
expected to be women.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1994 labor force was 77 percent White (median age 38), non-Hispanic, 11
percent Black (median age 36), nine percent Hispanic (median age 34), and four
percent Asian (median age 36).  In 2005, the labor force is expected to be 74
percent White, non-Hispanic, 11 percent Black, 11 percent Hispanic, and five
percent Asian.  The number of men 25 to 54 working or looking for work is
declining slightly as some unskilled workers give up the search for
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Nonfarm wage and salary employment is expected to increase from 113 million
to 130 million, with 12 million of the 17 million net new jobs in services.  In
1994, four major US industries employed 83 percent of wage and salary
workers--services 31 million, wholesale and retail trade, 26 million,
government 19 million, and manufacturing, 18 million; about one in six US jobs
is in one of the ten largest counties.</tt><p>
<tt>Among the 127 million US workers assigned to occupations in 1994, there
were 23 million persons in administrative support positions, such as
secretaries, insurance processors, and reservation agents; 20 million in
service occupations, from janitors to nursing aides to private guards; 17
million professionals, from engineers to social scientists and social workers;
17 million operators and laborers, from sewing machine operators to electronics
assemblers; 14 million craft workers, from carpenters to mechanics to butchers;
14 million in marketing occupations, such as cashiers and salespersons; 13
million managers and executives, and 4 million have agricultural
occupations.</tt><p>
<tt>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  1995. The State of the
World's Refugees.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, UNHCR assumed responsibility for 17 million people around the
world; by the beginning of 1995, that number had grown to more than 27 million,
including 14.5 million refugees, defined as persons outside their country of
citizenship and unable or unwilling to return because of political
persecution.</tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR also counts 5.4 million "internally displaced people," refugees
within their country of citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Founded in 1951, UNHCR is governed by an executive committee made up of
representatives from 50 governments.  Most of its  $1.1 billion budget in 1994
came from voluntary contributions of $1.06 billion in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Jacobsen, David.  1995.  Rights Across Borders:  Immigration and the
Decline of Citizenship.  Available from The Johns Hopkins University Press,
800-537-5487, fax(410) 516-6998</tt><p>
<tt>The admission and exclusion of outsiders is a fundamental expression of how
a nation defines itself.  Jacobsen argues that government control over
immigration is slipping, and a growing population of foreigners and
undocumented immigrants in Western Europe and the United States is raising
questions about the meaning of national community.</tt><p>
<tt>Jacobson believes that citizenship has been increasingly devalued, as
governments extend rights to foreigners, and that international human rights
law increasingly constrains national actions on immigration.  Jacobson argues
that the ethnic basis of citizenship in Germany, versus its political basis in
the United States, have shaped each country's response to immigration
challenges.</tt><p>
