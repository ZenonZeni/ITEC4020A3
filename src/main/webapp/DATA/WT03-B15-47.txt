<P>Mensure Yüksel Erdohan became editor-in chief of the newspaper <I>Özgür Ülke</I> (Free Land) after its offices were bombed in late 1994.  The publication was closed by the authorities in February 1995.  She was arrested and charged with more than 30 offences under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which imposes up to three years’ imprisonment for allegedly "separatist" statements, even if non-violent.  After five months in prison, and facing possibly decades of further imprisonment, Mensure Yüksel Erdohan tried to leave the country.  She was detained near the border on 24 September 1995, and later interrogated at Edirne and Istanbul Police Headquarters.  She says she was sexually assaulted and subjected to electric shocks.  Her requests to see a lawyer were ignored, and her family and lawyer’s applications to see her were rejected.

<P><I>"In detention at Istanbul Police Headquarters I was subjected to electric shocks…When my statement was being taken, my breasts were pulled out and fondled…They beat me until I fainted…They told me:  'We'll stick a dirty weapon in your hand and dump a whole lot of armed actions on you.  You'll spend all your life in prison'."</I>  

<P>Mensure Yüksel Erdohan was formally arrested on 5 October 1995, after 12 days in detention.  She complained of torture both to the prosecutor and the judge.  She claims that the judge deliberately prevented her complaint from being noted in the file by interrupting her, stopping the court recorder and changing the subject.

<P>While pressure on journalists is greatest in the southeast, reporters covering the activities of the security forces are at risk wherever they work.  In Istanbul, Metin Göktepe, a photographer, was covering the funeral of political prisoners who had been beaten to death in prison in early January 1996.  Police stopped the funeral and detained hundreds of people.  Metin Göktepe's body was found on 8 January in the grounds of a sports centre where the detainees had been taken.  He had been beaten to death.

<FONT COLOR="#0000B0"><h3 align=center>Targeting journalists</h3></FONT>
Turkey is one of the most dangerous countries in the world in which to pursue a career in journalism.  Fourteen journalists covering human rights issues in southeast Turkey have been killed or have "disappeared" at the hands of the security forces since 1992.  Others have been imprisoned and tortured.  Journalists throughout Turkey are at risk.  A photographer for a national daily paper was allegedly beaten to death by police officers in Istanbul in January 1996.  

<P>Officials have failed to condemn the killings of journalists, but have been quick to rebuke the newspapers for which they worked on the grounds that they propagate "separatist" opinions.  A confidential government circular accused the newspaper Özgür Ülke of being "an important threat"; less than three days later, on 3 December 1994, the newspaper’s offices in Istanbul and Ankara were bombed, killing one employee and wounding 19.

<P>Turkey has a lively media sector.  Turkish citizens now have more access to information and ideas in the news media than ever before.  Yet the authorities enforce severe restrictions on freedom of expression when it comes to security issues or Kurdish "separatism".  Freedom of expression is meaningless as long as journalists cannot report events without risking their liberty or their lives.
