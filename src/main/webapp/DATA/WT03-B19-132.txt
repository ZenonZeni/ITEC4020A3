<b>Technology Diffusion</b>
</FONT><br>
</center>
<p><br>
<p><br><p>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>
To enhance the international competitiveness of Victorian industry
by promoting and developing strategies for the diffusion of technology.
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>
Innovation and technology networks and services are known to increase
industry adoption of new technology.
<P>
The Commonwealth Government is supporting technology diffusion
as described in Working Nation.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<I>Technology diffusion and access in small to medium-sized enterprises
</I>
<P>
The consultancy study, a joint initiative of the Commonwealth
and Victorian governments under the former's Technology Access
Program, will survey a representative sample of small to medium
sized enterprises from selected industry sectors to find out how
they satisfy their technology needs, and where deficiencies lie.
<P>
The consultancy will recommend a model/s for a technology access
and diffusion network, and an implementation strategy. 
<H2>Rapid prototyping facility</H2>
<P>
A rapid prototyping facility turns designers'plans into models
quickly and easily.  It aids rapid product development, a key
capability for manufacturing companies.
<P>
Rapid prototype models help check product appearance, how parts
fit, and performance. Reductions of up to 40 per cent in development
costs and 60 per cent in development time may be achieved.
<P>
Rapid prototyping facilities are operating in South Australia
and Queensland.
<P>
The Advanced Engineering Centre for Manufacturing in Melbourne
has purchased a stereo lithography rapid prototyping machine.
Business Victoria partly funded a marketing exercise that confirmed
the viability of the project and its benefit to Victorian industry
and is partially funding a computer programmer for two years.
<P>
Major users of the technology are expected to include;
<UL>
<LI>Victorian manufacturers wishing to quickly check the appearance, fit
and performance of their new product, in order to bring them to market,
<LI>Tooling vendors and customers, education and research institutions,
and suppliers to the industry (pattern makers, computer aided-design
vendors, etc.)
</UL>
<P>
Product Express also can provide advice on material selection and design
of parts and also provides facilities for limited production runs of
prototype parts. Business Victoria partly funded a marketing exercise that
confirmed the viability of the project and its benefits to Victorian industry
and is partially funding a computer programmer for two years.

<P>
<H2>Tooling Industry Initiative</H2>
<P>
The Victorian Tooling Industry underpins the State's manufacturing base and
also exports tooling in its own right.
<P>
Business Victoria sponsored a Tooling Industry forum in March 1995 which for
the first time brought the majority of the state's toolmakers together to
discuss their industry and its future.
The first resolution of the forum was to establish an industry association.
<P>
Business Victoria is assisting a steering committee composed of leading
toolmakers to draw up a charter and busienss plan for the association.
<P>
<H2>Technology Networking Specialist</H2>
<P>
On completion of the Technology Diffusion Study (see above), a
Technology Networking Specialist will be appointed to Business
Victoria.
<P>
Guided by recommendations of the Technology Diffusion Study, the
Technology Networking Specialist will oversee technology diffusion
initiatives and assist in consolidating Victoria's
technology diffusion networks.
<P>
The role will complement those of the Biotechnology Specialist,
a Commonwealth Government commitment, and of the Engineering Specialist
who provides assistance to firms in the advanced manufacturing
technologies sector.
<H2>Users</H2>
<P>
Eligible enterprises seeking assistance in transferring and assimilating
technology into their operations, especially small to medium sized
enterprises.
<P>
Victorian manufacturers wishing to test the appearance,
fit and performance of their new products, in order to bring them
to market quickly.
<P>
Tooling vendors and customers, education and research institutions,
and suppliers to the industry (pattern makers, computeraided-design
vendors, etc.)

<H2>Outcomes</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A technology diffusion network/s is implemented.
<LI>An opportunity for Victorian manufacturers to get new products
to the market faster.
<LI>Performance improvements in the tooling industry, consistent with
Technical Adoption Demonstration Projects.
</UL>
