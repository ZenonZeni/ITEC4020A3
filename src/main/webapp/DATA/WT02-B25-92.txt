<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is Lithium?</font></p>
<p>Lithium carbonate - a salt - came to be regularly used to control manic depressive illness in 
this country in the 1960's. Today it is the most commonly used medication to treat bipolar 
(manic-depressive) illness. There are a variety of different brands of lithium dispensed in 
tablets, capsule, and liquid form: Lithotabs, Lithane, Lithonate, Eskatlith, Cibalith, and 
Lithobid. Lithium is helpful in 70 percent to 80 percent of bipolar patients, making it one of 
the most effective psychiatric medications available.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><b>What it treats: </b></font></p>
<p>Lithium has been most frequently and effectively used to control and prevent manic episodes 
in persons with bipolar disorder. Lithium has been successful in treating depression as well. 
In fact the occurrence of depression in a patient who has been taking lithium is often an 
indication that a higher dose is needed. In some cases, lithium is even a successful treatment 
for patients with unipolar depression, or those who have never had a manic episode. 
Patients who respond to lithium for depression are often people who have not responded to 
tricyclic antidepressants after several weeks of treatment. When given lithium in addition to 
their antidepressants, some of these patients have shown significant improvement. </p>
<p>Lithium has also successfully treated schizophrenia in cases where there is a schizophrenic 
thought disorder accompanied by a change in mood that mimics either mania or depression. 
The similarity between these patients with schizophrenia and those diagnosed with manic 
depression is their affective disorder -- that is the experience of strong emotions not related 
to what is happening in the environment. Patients with schizophrenia not experiencing an 
affective disorder will be unlikely to respond to the combination of lithium and 
antipsychotic medication. </p>
<p>For Lithium to reach its maximum effectiveness, two or even three weeks is often required. 
To control severe mania, doctors often will prescribe an anitpsychotic such as Haldol while 
waiting for lithium to take affect. When the manic symptoms disappear, the antipsychotic 
will usually be discontinued, but the lithium continued. </p>
<p>Physicians using combinations of lithium and anitpsychotics are urged to closely monitor 
patients because of the danger of a toxic reaction to the combination of lithium and Haldol. </p>
<p>Some patients on lithium report having breakthrough depression. These patients may 
respond to an increase in the dosage or the addition of an antidepressant. When depressions 
occur in patients who have been taking lithium and who are able to tolerate a higher dose, it 
is possible that the dosage has been inadequate. </p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><b>Side Effects:</b></font></p>
<p>Common side effects of lithium include nausea, loss of appetite, and mild diarrhea. These 
usually will taper off after the first few weeks. Dizziness and hand tremors have also been 
reported, and tremors can be diminished effectively if the dosage of lithium is gradually 
decreased. Medications that control tremors are Cogentin and Inderal. With Inderal, 
however, there may be a lowering of the patient's blood pressure and heartrate, and sudden 
discontinuation can cause anxiety and tremulousness. </p>
<p>Increased production of urine and excessive thirst are two common side effects that are 
usually not serious problems, but patients with kidney disease should not be given lithium. 
Midamor is a drug that can reduce urinating. Taking the day's dosage of lithium at bedtime 
also seems to help with the problem of increased urination. Other side effects of lithium 
include weight gain, hypothyroidism, increased white blood cell count, skin rashes, and 
birth defects. (See lithium and pregnancy below) </p>
<p>People who are taking lithium should consult their doctor before taking the following: 
Ibuprofen (Advil), acetazolamide, antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium 
channel blockers, carbamazepine, diuretics, hydroxyzine, inderal, procardia, marijuana, 
muscle relaxants, neuroleptics, table salt, baking powder, tetracycline, tricyclic 
antidepressants, MOA inhibitors, or caffeine. </p>
<p>While on lithium, a patient's blood level must be closely monitored. If the blood level of 
lithium is too low, the patient's symptoms will not be relieved. If the blood level of lithium 
is too high, there is a danger of a toxic reaction. </p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><b>Lithium and pregnancy:</b></font></p>
<p>A study was done in 1992 to measure the effect of lithium on unborn babies. It was found 
that exposure to lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy might be associated with the 
increased risk of Ebstein's anomaly, a rare cardiac malformation. Otherwise, the rate of 
congenital malformations did not differ between the group that took lithium and the control 
group. Birthweight, however, was found to be significantly higher in the lithium group, 
despite the high percentage of lithium users who were also cigarette smokers (almost twice 
as many as the control group).</p>
