<P>       CASE NUMBER:          16 
<P>       CASE MNEMONIC:      COCA 
<P>       CASE NAME:          Coca Trade and Land Use Changes
<HR>
     The production of cocaine in South America, especially the
Andean region, has had a devastating impact on the environment. 
The environmental destruction can be seen throughout the
product's
life cycle effects.  The effects cover a wide range of
environmental problems including pesticide use, chemical dumping,
deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, a shift to mono-
agriculture, bio-diversity loss, and a potential loss of cultural
eco-knowledge.  In an attempt to assist the Andean region, and to
lessen the international drug trade, the United States has
attempted to set up economic alternatives, such as the Andean
Trade
Preference (ATP) Act of 1991, in hopes of shifting the economies
of
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador away from this highly
profitable market.
