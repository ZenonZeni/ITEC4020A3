A PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR?

While accountants in the US were celebrating the victory in narrowing
liability, some practitioners in the UK were starting to count hard the
cost of unlimited, as well as joint and several, liability.

The final shape of the US tort reform, which became law just before the
Christmas break, looks a sensible measure which should protect
accountants from the excesses of frivolous actions, but leaves them
exposed enough to want to maintain the highest professional standards
(see page 2 for full report).

Unfortunately, the issues are not so clear-cut in the UK where the
conjunction of several events has tangled the debate. Firstly, there is
the Binders/ADT legal case. The action related to an agreed bid by
Britannia Security Group, audited by Binders. After the acquisition ADT
found the profits and net assets over stated. The judge found that not
only had Binders been negligent but they owed a duty of care to ADT
because the lead partner told ADT in an 'off the cuff' remark that he
stood by the firm's audit opinion. Out goes Caparo where it was decided
an auditor did not have a duty of care to third parties - unless the
Appeal Court says something different.

There is only bad news and worse news

On to the damages: the bad news was that the judge awarded damages
totalling #105m ($160m): the worse news is that the firm only has
insurance cover of #71m leaving partners to pick up the tag for the
rest - an uncomfortable #300,000 each for the 100 or so partners
involved. Binders partners are left to sweat for a year or so and the
rest of the profession can declare that something must be done to solve
the problem they have, in part, created. The obvious solution would be
reform the law, but that looks unlikely to happen quickly, with a
government gearing up for an election, despite an official review of
the problem which is due to be published soon.

So the Big 6 firms lost patience and decided to take matters into their
own hands.

Incorporation seems the best way forward

Before the ADT decision, KPMG partners had already announced that they
were going to incorporate as the best solution they could find to the
liability crisis. And alongside incorporation they have promised full
financial disclosure. Whether the revelation over size of partners'
drawing helps or hinders the firms' cause remains to be seen.

At the same time as the ADT bombshell, Ernst & Young and Price
Waterhouse announced they intend to avoid possible financial disaster
by forming limited liability partnerships in the offshore haven of
Jersey. All they need is the legislation due this summer from the
Jersey Parliament which would be similar to Delaware law in the US and,
in theory at least, would protect partners' private assets.

Whether any of these moves will, in the long run, help firms
professionally, commercially or on the PR front, remains to be seen.
There are many examples of trends starting in the US and quickly
reaching the UK and elsewhere. In the case of tort reform, for UK
partners at least, this particular trend cannot cross the pond too
soon.

ACCOUNTANTS GET LITIGATION RELIEF FOR CHRISTMAS

Just days before Christmas, the US accounting profession's long held
wish for securities litigation reform was finally granted. It was the
best Christmas present imaginable for a profession that has been
battered by enormous legal expenses.

For the past four years, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) and the major accounting firms had intensely
lobbied Congress for litigation reform. 'We are extremely pleased with
the legislation enacted,' Margaret Simmons, legislative affairs
coordinator for AICPA, told WAR.

In recent years, the Big 6 firms have collectively spent as much as 12%
of their annual fee income defending or settling litigation. The new
legislation should significantly lighten that burden.

Two key provisions of the new legislation, formally known as the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are expected to curb
the number of lawsuits brought against accountants. The first has to do
with what is known as the pleading stage of a case. The new law
requires that plaintiffs in a securities lawsuit make specific
allegations of management fraud at the time the suit is filed, said
Simmons.

This was not a requirement in the past. Plaintiff attorneys had been
accused of turning the discovery stage into fishing expeditions
designed to rack up huge legal bills. The mounting legal costs
encouraged many defendants to cut their losses by settling out of
court, even though they might have been innocent of any wrongdoing.
Legal scholars say that the new pleading standard raises the threshold
for a case to proceed to discovery, which should significantly reduce
accounting firms' legal expenses.

A second important provision of the reform bill does away with the
joint and several liability system that had been in place. Under the
new law, defendants can only be held responsible for the proportion of
the losses they are deemed to have caused. In the past, if a company
went insolvent and its auditors were deemed to have contributed to even
a small percentage of investor losses, the accounting firm could be
held fully liable for all investor losses.

Under the new law, joint and several liability remains in place only in
instances where the accounting firm is shown to have participated in
the fraud.

AICPA president Barry Melancon said the law now strikes a fair balance
between the rights of truly defrauded investors and outside
professionals 'who had become victims of a small group of
entrepreneurial lawyers abusing the legal system.'

Other important protections afforded by the new law include:

- A 'safe harbour' provision protects companies, and their advisers,
from claims of fraud in the event that their prediction of future
performance do not pan out.

- A provision requires courts to sanction plaintiffs and plaintiff
attorneys who initiate frivolous lawsuits.

- The statute of limitations for filing securities lawsuits remains
unchanged. Plaintiffs must file claims within three years of the time
the violation occurred or within one year of the time the violation is
discovered.

- A provision allows judges to select as lead plaintiff in a class-
action lawsuit the party with the greatest financial stake. Some
plaintiffs had been accused of taking small stakes in numerous
companies, thereby positioning themselves to become lead plaintiffs to
the largest number of potential class actions.

The accounting community's original reform wish-list included several
other provisions which became casualties of the legislative process and
did not become law. These included a fee shifting proposal that would
have required unsuccessful plaintiffs to pay all legal fees incurred by
the defendants.

All in all, the new law provides accountants all the protections they
could have reasonably hoped for, Simmons said.

As a tradeoff for the protections afforded by the act, accountants will
be subjected to additional oversight on the part of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The new law gives the SEC the power to
prosecute accountants, lawyers and underwriters who wittingly help
corporate executives commit fraud.

The SEC had previously had that power stripped from it in a 1994
Supreme Court case. The court held that corporate advisers could not be
held liable for the actions of their clients.

Another significant concession made by the accounting profession is a
provision of the law which make accountants responsible to report
fraud. An auditor who uncovers fraud during an audit must report the
illegality to the company's audit committee, its board of directors or,
in some circumstances, the SEC.

The new legislation is notable not only for the protections it affords
accountants, but also for the dramatic manner in which it became law.

In early December, both houses of Congress voted on and passed the
final version of the litigation reform bill by wide margins. It was
presented to President Clinton, who had earlier expressed his support,
to be signed into law.

At the eleventh hour, the president unexpectedly vetoed the
legislation. The veto reportedly came after the president held a
private meeting with William Lerach, a prominent member of the
plaintiff bar and one of the largest contributors to the Democratic
party which funded Clinton's presidential bid.

In response, the AICPA fired off a terse press release decrying the
veto. It read in part: 'The President has once again neglected the will
of the people and caved in to a small group of wealthy, powerful
contributors.'

Despite the veto, the coalition supporting the bill held together. On
20 December and 22 December respectively, the House of Representatives
and the Senate voted to override the presidential veto (a two-thirds
super majority was required in each chamber) and passed the bill into
law.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was the first veto
override suffered by the Clinton administration.

REPORT PUBLISHED ON PROVISIONS

FASB has published a report, Provisions: Their recognition, measurement
and disclosure in financial statements, in conjunction with standard-
setters in the UK, Canada and Australia as well as the International
Accounting Standards Committee. The report is aimed at developing
solutions to accounting problems based on common accounting frameworks.

FASB chairman Dennis Beresford noted that: 'Accounting for provisions
is an important topic for standard-setters around the world because
they are often material in reporting financial performance. Very little
accounting guidance currently exists for provisions, which may lead to
a diversity in practice.'

The report explores the basic issues of when provisions should be
recognised, how they should be measured, and what disclosures should be
made. Additionally, the report considers specific applications to
future operating losses and restructuring costs, areas in which
provisions are often recognised.

WORKSHOP DEFINES OBJECTIVES

An UNCTAD workshop on environmental accounting recently established
priorities for its current work programme. Participants decided to
prepare a synthesis of existing financial accounting requirements, look
at links between financial reporting and general environmental
monitoring information, and work on systems which produce environmental
cost accounting information for companies.

Following on from the 1995 conference of the Intergovernmental Working
Group of Experts in International Standards of Accounting and Reporting
(ISAR) which presented a series of studies on environmental accounting
(see WAR, April 1995, p2), participants from several countries met in
Geneva recently to discuss what further contribution UNCTAD could make
in this area. The ISAR conference had suggested that some form of
guidelines could be produced.

The working party defined environmental accounting as taking in
financial accounting (eg provisions for decommissioning costs), 'full
cost' management accounting, general environmental reporting, and
environmental audit. It decided that work could be done to present and
integrate existing financial accounting rules which bear on
environmental issues as a first step. Similarly, a study could be made
of environmental reporting indicators in use to see which were the most
meaningful, and examine whether any useful link could be built between
financial reporting and the present free-ranging, voluntary
environmental reporting which is being done by some companies.

Some companies are experimenting with cost accounting which provides a
picture of environmental costs. Participants observed that much of this
work was not published because of its confidential nature, but this
prevented rapid development. UNCTAD had a role there, but it was felt
that it should not involve itself further in environmental auditing.

It was also decided that UNCTAD should look at the possibility of
providing an electronic bulletin board for environmental accounting
literature, as well as developing education and training programmes in
due course.

TRADE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) working party on professional
services, which is working on cross-border provision of accounting
services, had its third meeting in January. The meeting set out a list
of subjects to be addressed in a model agreement, and asked for further
information on professional qualifications in developing countries.

The WTO's council for trade in services was established as part of the
last GATT agreement to prepare the way for a liberalisation of cross-
border trade in services, with accounting as a priority. It has
established a working party which met for the first time last October
(see WAR November 1995, p3) whose objective is to prepare a model
agreement for cross-border trade in accounting services.

At its January meeting in Geneva, the working party, to which all WTO
members are entitled to send representatives, agreed on a list of
issues which would need to be addressed in any model agreement. This
list includes questions such as:

- mutual recognition of professional qualifications
- minimum periods of post-qualification experience
- minimum educational requirements
- professional liability arrangements
- relationships with local professional bodies
- use of IASC standards.

Members of the working party agreed to review these issues from a
national perspective and meet again in March to discuss them.

Although the working party had already been given extensive briefings
by IFAC and UNCTAD in October, some members felt that they need further
information about conditions in developing countries before they could
proceed. The collection of such data would take some time, and would
have the effect of considerably slowing progress, which could, of
course, be one reason for suggesting it.

WHO HOLDS THE GOVERNANCE REINS?

A taskforce of the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) has
released a report entitled Who holds the reins?, focusing on the
international dimension of corporate governance, from a review of
corporate governance practices and issues in countries such as the US,
UK and Canada.

The taskforce encourages all major companies to disclose the key areas
of their corporate governance processes so that they have appropriate
checks in place to direct and manage businesses, and so that investors
understand that differences exist between countries. The taskforce
however ruled out the idea of prescribing an international standard for
corporate governance because, as ICMG members stated: 'Governance is
about behaviour. It is deeply rooted in national cultures which vary
widely, reflecting the economic, social and legal traditions of each
country.'

ICMG is encouraging debate on its recommendations among its constituent
members - the Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs, the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Section on
Business Law of the International Bar Association.

Copies of Who holds the reins? are available from IFAC, 114 West 47th
Street, Suite 2410, New York, NY 10036.

IASC LOOKS AGAIN AT SEGMENTAL REPORTING

The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), has published
an Exposure Draft, E51 on segmental reporting which proposes major
changes to its existing standard, published 15 years ago.

E51 proposes to change the way in which segments are identified and add
several new segment disclosure requirements. It would also make an
enterprise's internal organisation and management structure and its
system of internal financial reporting to the chief executive officer
the basis for identifying the dominant source and nature of risks and
therefore the business or geographical segments reported.

A safety net provision will ensure that if there is evidence that
internally reported segments combine parts of the business with
different risks and returns, they must be disaggregated for external
reporting purposes.

The E51 proposals are the result of cooperation between IASC and North
American standard-setters, as well as extensive consultations with
financial analysts and multinational corporations.

EUROPE: FEE STATES GROWTH IN ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING

FEE has published a survey called Environmental accounting, reporting
and auditing: Survey of current activities and developments within the
accountancy profession covering all 15 European Union countries, as
well as Iceland, Israel, Norway and Switzerland.

It concludes that there is clear and definite growth in the importance
attached to environmental accounting, reporting and auditing in
business across the EU, but environmental information is still largely
restricted to qualitative information with no assessment of the
financial impact.

The survey is based on the responses to a questionnaire circulated
among FEE's 34 member organisations in 22 countries.

FEE said that: 'The development of an accounting and management
reporting framework which specifically addresses environmental issues
is perhaps some way off. In the meantime, firms should be encouraged to
disclose more detailed environmental information in their financial
statements with an indication of the financial impact, while auditors
should cooperate more closely with experts and advisers from other
disciplines in the environmental field.

ECO-AUDIT STANDARDS ARE 'ACCEPTABLE'

EU Environment Ministers meeting in Brussels on 18 December raised no
objections to the British, Irish and Spanish standards for eco-audits.
The standards need formal recognition under the EU's environmental
management and audit system regulation, which came into being last
April. The British standard BS7750, the Irish Standard IS310, First
Edition and the Spanish standard UNE77-801(2)-94 were referred to the
Council of Ministers owing to disagreement in the EMAS regulatory
committee.

EU GREEN ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES PUBLISHED

Businesses in the EU can now include environmental expenditure in their
annual accounts. Guidelines have been drawn up by the Accounting
Advisory Forum as an advisory document for the EC, and focus on
applying the provisions in the EU's 4th and 7th Company Law Directives
on annual and consolidated accounts to environmental considerations.
Although not legally binding, they are the only green accounting
guidelines to be formulated at EU level so far. The EC is urging
companies to use them in response to a growing insistence by
shareholders and investors that companies shoulder their environmental
protection responsibilities, although it said that the report does not
reflect its official position.

The objective of the guidelines, entitled Environmental issues in
financial reporting is to ensure that company accounts paint an
accurate picture of:

- a company's attitude towards the environment, and

- the impact of environmental risks and liabilities on a company's
financial position.

The document provides recommendations on the definition and disclosure
of environmental expenditure and the recognition, measurement and
disclosure of environmental risks and liabilities.

AUSTRALIA: SOCIETY CALLS FOR E50'S WITHDRAWAL

The Australian Society CPAs is calling for the immediate withdrawal of
E50, the ISAC's proposed International Accounting Standard on
intangibles. In an unprecedented public attack on IASC actions, ASCPA
president Jim Kropp said the proposed standard 'out of touch with the
modern economy' and will 'discriminate against companies which have
assets of this kind'.

'There is a need to reassess how to measure, recognise and disclose
identifiable intangible assets - and this should not be done by
redefinition of terms nor by taking the issue outside the context of
existing standard.'

The Society has sent the IASC a submission based on a recent Society
report Accounting for identifiable intangible assets including
goodwill. The report argues that intangibles should not be treated any
differently from other assets.

Jim Kropp, a partner in Price Waterhouse, Sydney, maintains there is
increasing diversity among international standards addressing the
recognition and measurement of assets.

'In this draft, for example, there are many exemptions, as well as
inconsistencies with other international standards such as IAS 16
'Property plant and equipment' and IAS 22 'Business combinations' which
would penalise enterprises developing or holding intellectual assets.

'What we most strenuously object to is the impact on those enterprises
with intangible assets.' In most cases, these companies will be forced
to amortise the asset within 20 years - a period which is often much
less than the useful life of the asset - and a period which will force
companies with extremely valuable intangibles to suffer a paper loss in
real company value. 'Such a harsh approach is unwarranted and out of
touch with modern economic reality.'

Kropp said that some assets have an indeterminate useful life and would
be best measured by subjecting them to a recoverable test rather than
the amortisation regime advocated in E50. The Society also criticised
the restrictive approach taken to initial recognition of an intangible
asset being based solely on cost. The use of an 'other value' approach,
provided it can be reliably measured, is appropriate, particularly in
relation to intangibles, the submission states.

The ASCPA wants E50 to be withdrawn and reconsidered by the IAS
Steering Committee.

'In its current form, the Society would not recommend to the Australian
Accounting Standards Boards and the Public Sector Accounting Standards
Board to pursue Australian harmonisation with this draft standard,'
Kropps said. 'This is a good example of why Australian standard-setters
should maintain strong influence over the direction of international
standards.'

GOODWILL ED ISSUED

'The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and the Public
Sector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB), have approved the issue of
an Exposure Draft which proposes changing the accounting standard on
goodwill to require entities to amortise goodwill on a straight-line
basis.

They say the effect of the amendments would 'make the Australian
standard and existing practice more comparable with standards and
practices in most other countries.'

The main effect of the proposal will be to preclude the use, by a small
number of entities, of the 'Inverse Sum Of the Years Digits' (ISOYD)
and similar methods.

The ISOYD method results in small amortisation charges in early years
and the defers the bulk of amortisation charges to later years. In
September 1995, the Urgent Issues Group placed a moratorium on the use
of ISOYD method until 1 July 1996, and requested the Boards to clarify
the standard.

The Exposure Draft proposes that the standard will apply to reporting
periods ending on or after 30 June 1996. AASB chairman, Ken Spencer,
notes that the scope of the current review of the standard is limited
to dealing with the issue referred to Boards by the UIG. Consideration
of this issue could not be delayed and considered as part of a more
comprehensive review of the standards. International developments, such
as the new approach to accounting for goodwill being debated in the UK,
are not likely to become clear before the UIG moratorium ends. The
Exposure Draft is open for public comment until 15 February 1996.

ED RELEASED ON NON-CURRENT ASSETS

AASB and PSASB have released Exposure Draft on accounting for non-
current assets. ED 70, proposes amendments to the depreciation and
revaluation standards to remove impediments for entities adopting
current values for non-current assets. The proposed amendments to the
revaluation standard would permit entities to revalue non-current
assets on a progressive basis, as long as all assets within the
relevant class are revalued consistently within a three year period.

The standard, which currently require revaluations of all assets within
a class to be completed as at the same date, is considered to impose an
onerous requirement on public sector entities which have adopted a
policy of revaluing non-current assets frequently and on an on-going
basis.

ED 70 permits entities, adopting a current cost or deprival value
bases, an option in the disclosure of asset value. ED 70 also proposes
that the definition of 'useful life' in the depreciation standards be
changed to reflect the period over which an entity expects to use an
assets rather than the period over which the asset could remain useful
in some other environment.

The Boards say this amendment will ensure that depreciation expenses
are more closely related to the pattern of economic benefits consumed
by the entity and that the amended standards will be more comparable
with pronouncements overseas.

The comment period for ED 70 is short. It closes on 29 February 1996.
The short period reflects the need for public sector entities to adopt
these amendments in preparing their financial reports for 30 June 1996.

EQUITY METHODS PROPOSED

AASB and PSAB have also approved the issue of ED 71, Accounting for
investments in associates by the equity method. The ED proposes that
entities equity account investments in associates in their financial
statements. The Boards note there is a perceived impediment in the
Corporations Law to applying equity accounting on the face of the
financial statements, and companies are disclosing information about
their associates in the notes to the financial statements.

The Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 proposes to remove
the perceived legal impediment to equity accounting.

Now the Boards have responded by developing an Exposure Draft which, if
adopted, would bring Australian practices in this area into line with
practice overseas.

The ED proposes that equity accounting be applied in the consolidated
financial statements for all investments in associates and, except in
limited circumstances, the cost method of accounting is to be applied
in the investor's separate financial statements.

Other features of the draft proposals:

- the equity method of accounting is to be applied in respect of all
associates. Associates are defined broadly to include associated
companies, partnerships, trusts and other forms of arrangement in which
the investor has an ownership interest and has the capacity to exercise
significant influence;

- the carrying amount of an equity accounted investment must not exceed
its net market value;

The ED proposes that the subsequent standard will apply for reporting
periods ending on or after 30 June 1997. Closing date for public
comment on the proposals is 31 March 1996.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE DERECOGNISED

The Urgent Issues Group (UIG) is continuing to examine the issue of
whether internally generated identifiable intangible assets can be
'derecognised'.

The group notes that the accounting standards AASB 1010 and AAS 10,
Accounting for the revaluation of non-current assets identify the
circumstances in which assets can be revalued downwards, and Statement
of Accounting Concepts ASC 4, Definition and recognition of the
elements of financial statements, identifies the circumstances in which
assets could be derecognised.

At its most recent meeting the UIG concluded that the issue under
consideration was much broader than that the derecognition of only
internally generated intangible assets. The group agreed that it should
clarify that a 'revaluation' included a change in accounting policies
related to the bases of measurement adopted for any class of assets.

A once only change in the basis should be allowed, and that a change
back to a cost basis should be permitted only within the transitional
period.

After this transitional period expires AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will only
allow a downwards revaluation arising from a change in the basis of
measurement when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
recoverable amount.

In these circumstances AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will require that the asset
not be revalued below its recoverable amount.

LACK OF CONSENSUS ON DEPRECIATION POLICY

The UIG has been unable to reach a consensus on the treatment of
changes in the rate of depreciation which arise from revised estimates
of useful life or residual value.

The alternatives canvassed by the UIG include depreciating the asset at
the new rate over its remaining life, or adjusting the carrying amount
of the asset by making a catch-up adjustment in the profit and loss or
other operating statement.

The relevant accounting standards AASB 1021 and AAS 4, Depreciation of
non-current assets do not specify how to deal with revisions of
estimates and the requirements of international standards vary as does
practice in Australia.

Discussion at the UIG indicated that most Australian companies adopted
a prospective approach and this was the practice in many overseas
countries.

To reach a consensus, 11 of the 16 UIG members must vote for, and no
more than two vote against, the proposed ruling.

A majority of members favoured the prospective approach but there were
more than two members who did not think it correct. The group does not
plan to discuss the issue any further.

- Peter Day has been appointed chairman of the UIG in place of Peter
Edwards who died last year. Day is currently managing director of Group
Business Services at CRA Ltd. He is a former chairman of the Australian
Accounting Standards Board and a former president of the Group of 100.

BULGARIA: ACCOUNTING FOR BANKS STANDARD APPROVED

A new National Accounting Standard (NAS) 16 has been approved by the
government in Bulgaria to replace the existing NAS 16. It deals with
accounting for banks and non-banking financial institutions.

The new standard focuses mainly on financial statements, but it also
deals with branches of foreign banks and non-banking organisations,
performing banking transactions in Bulgaria with a permit (licence)
issued by the Bulgarian National Bank.

In this standard the Bulgarian National Bank is defined as the
authorised organisation to determine rules of accounting for bank
operations. The most significant difference between the old standard
and the new one is that the detailed regulation of the principles of
accounting for bank operations - which were described at length in the
old standard - is absent in the latter. The other difference is that
the primary accounting documents and ledgers, such as journal of the
operations, trial balance, general ledger, operation ledger etc, were
described in detail in the old standard. The structure of the National
Bank Chart of Accounts, in effect since 1 June 1995, was elaborated in
the old Chart of Accounts, while the new standard only briefly mentions
the existence of such a Chart of Accounts.

Opinions differ. Some experts think that the new Chart of Accounts is
much more concise and clearer. Others - mainly bank experts - say that
it is much more incomplete and insufficient.

NAS 16 has the following structure:

- General provisions - describing the regulations and institutions they
are applicable for.

- Definitions - giving definitions to the term financial institution,
bank transaction, bank operation, individual item, accounting date,
values.

- Characteristics of the accounting policy.
- Specific rules of accounting for bank operations.
- Periodic financial statements. Financial statements.

FRANCE: PEER REVIEW RESULTS PUBLISHED

The auditors' association, the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux
Comptes (CNCC), and the stock market regulator, the Commission des
Operations de Bourse (COB), have published their annual report for 1994
on the review of audit files of listed companies and investment funds.
The report notes that 94% of the cases were satisfactory, but they
noted problems concerning the treatment of intangibles in group
accounts, the methods for determining provisions, and the completeness
of the financial information provided by companies.

COB and CNCC operate joint committees which review the audit files of
listed companies. This year the committees looked at 90 companies on
the main market and 37 on the second market as well as 39 investment
funds.

The review committees noted that the evaluation of internal controls
had improved and overall the number of problems noted had fallen,
suggesting an improvement in audit quality. However, they said that the
most common problems concerned the calculation of goodwill in
consolidated accounts and other intangibles and their depreciation.
They also thought that the choices made by companies in excluding or
including companies within the consolidation were not well-documented
or explained. They criticised the methods used by some companies in
calculating provisions.

CNCC has a programme of peer review for all audit engagements, although
COB participates only in the examination of the files of listed
companies. In the year under review, in addition to the work on listed
companies, CNCC looked at 4,400 audit files throughout France,
involving the work of 2,200 auditors.

FRANCE: FREE SERVICES FOR NEW COMPANIES

The Ordre des Experts Comptables has undertaken a series of initiatives
designed to encourage newly-formed businesses to use the services of
accounting firms. These will involve free start-up advice and budget
preparation, as well as reduced fees for work during the first three
years of a company's life.

An agreement signed by Rene Richol, president Ordre, and the Minister
of Finance in 1994 provided for free services for individual
entrepreneurs in the first year of their activity, including budgets
and ultimately preparations of the first tax return. To this has now
been added two further agreements, with the Centres de gestion agrees
(management centres) and the chambers of commerce.

Historically the members of the Ordre have regarded the management
centres, a government initiative to provide free advice to small
businesses, as competitors, but they have now agreed to provide
management training for management centre clients, and develop
diagnostic models which would help new small businesses to develop.

The Ordre is offering up to three years of work at reduced fees for
businesses which are members of an Association for the Development of
Young Businesses. In addition it has agreed with the national
organisation of chambers of commerce to provide budgets for business
seeking finance. The chambers of commerce will help validate forecasts.

ISRAEL: COMMISSION REJECTS AUDIT STANDARD

In a surprise move, the Securities Commission has stated that it will
not accept accounts with new style audit report. In December 1995 the
Institute published a new version of the audit reports as part of its
plan to adopt many of the IFAC and IASC standards as soon as possible.

The extended report refers specifically to the extent of the auditors'
work. The standard which was to apply to all accounts ending or after
31 December 1995 was firmly rejected by the Commission which claimed
that the new report is an attempt to reduce the auditors'
responsibilities and liabilities.

The Institute has stated that its only intention remains to explain
clearly the extent of the work of the auditor and reduce the
expectation gap of shareholders and the public. The Institute has
always contended that it has the sole right to set standards and
therefore the Auditors' Council (an office of the Ministry of Justice)
stepping in to settle the dispute has taken the profession by surprise.
The Ministry of Justice is now preparing a legal opinion as to the
authority of the Institute to set standards. Meanwhile the Institute
has agreed that the new standard will only be used on auditors' reports
signed after mid February. Members of the Institute's central committee
and members in general fear that it is yet another example of the
Securities Commission trying to 'muscle in' on the standards making
process. After years of disputes concerning accounting standards, in
the end a joint committee with the Institute, Securities Commission,
Industrialists and the tax authorities was formed. It was assumed that
the audit standards would remain the sole prerogative of the Institute.

ISRAEL: QUALITY CONTROL RULE FACES REBELLION

Israel Pinini, treasurer of the Institute, has mounted a final effort
to prevent the adoption of the new standard for quality control in
accountant's office. He hopes that within a few days he will have
sufficient members (300) to call a special general meeting to block the
new standard, due to be adopted this month. Small practices contend
that the administration and requirements for specialised departments
will create a two tier practice or drive them out of the profession.
The Institute sees the standard as a prelude to adopting ISO 9000.

ISRAEL: LAW INCREASES AUDITORS' LIABILITIES

The new company law currently passing through the Knesset (parliament)
has further increased the profession's anxieties about professional
negligence claims. The new law proposes the auditors must report on all
the actions of directors. The proposal is that they must examine and
comment on not only financial matters but also all aspects of
management and administration and the affect on the company,
shareholders, other interested parties, and the general public.
Meanwhile the director is personally indemnified against his actions.

In addition it is proposed that auditors fees will be set in general
meeting of the members only. This right cannot be delegated to the
directors, even on a temporary basis.

ISRAEL: ROTATION OF AUDITORS IS A MYTH

Government companies are required to change auditors every three years.
In practice the management of the companies postpone the change
whenever possible. The latest example is the Electricity Corporation,
one of the largest and most profitable companies in Israel. Despite the
requirement to appoint a new auditor, the management have successfully
postponed the change indefinitely. As a result, Somekh Chaikan (Price
Waterhouse) remain the auditors and Kost Levary & Forer (Ernst & Young)
lose out.

ITALY: COOPERS' AUDIT APPOINTMENT REVOKED

Coopers & Lybrand have suffered a serious blow as a result of the
Gemina affair. In September a major merger operation - SuperGemina-
Ferfin - was announced followed soon after by revelations of heavy
losses within the Gemina group.

In a newsletter published last month (January), Commissione Nazionale
per le Societa e la Borsa (Consob - the companies and stock market
regulator which also supervises the roll of approved audit firms),
announced that it has instructed Coopers not to use the services of its
partner Renato Bellani for a period of two years. Moreover, the
accountants have had their three-year 1995-1997 appointment as Gemina's
auditors revoked.

In announcing its decision, Consob said: 'The penalty has been adopted
on the basis of the checks carried out on the audit work for the 1992
and 1993 financial statements of Gemina Ratealfactor, of the Gemina
group consolidated accounts for 1993 and consolidated accounts of RCS
Editori at 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1993.'

Following Consob's decision, Coopers said that it seems that Consob has
chosen the Gemina affair to set a pilot decision. 'For the first time,
in fact, a form of objective responsibility has been adopted with
regard to the principal auditors of a group, putting the blame onto
them for the work done by others.'

Making their complaint against the regulator, Coopers said that the
losses which were the subject of Consob's investigations in the Gemina
case, arose in the hire purchase sales sector of RCS Libri & Grandi
Opere and that these losses were not brought into evidence quickly
because of serious shortcomings in the internal controls of the
company. But RCS Libri & Grandi Opere was audited by another firm,
while Coopers audited its parent, RCS Editori, and the group parent
Gemina. Coopers, in accordance with current practice, relied on the
work done by the other, well-qualified, audit firm, which had audited
RCS Libri & Grandi Opere for many years.

Coopers claim that their work was wholly correct and say that the
losses investigated by Consob, in so far as they were reflected in
Gemina's consolidated accounts, arose from sources that were not within
Coopers' competence. 'Consob's decision is therefore unjust and Coopers
will appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to have it
annulled,' said the firm.

ITALY: PROFESSION DISPUTE RAGES ON

The long-running dispute between Italy's dottori commercialisti
(commercial practitioner accountants) and ragionieri (bookkeeper
accountants) on professional titles is continuing. In mid-December the
dottori commercialisti's national council wrote to Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini, in his temporary capacity as Justice Minister, to
express its concern and seek remedial action. The dottori
commercialisti are expected to mount a publicity campaign in which the
problem of professional safeguards for the public will be highlighted.
As university graduates, they object to the use of the title
commercialisti by ragionieri. On the other hand, the ragionieri, who
also wrote to Dini in mid-December, would like to see a single role of
accountants, with the two titles unified. They say that the dottori
commercialisti have brought too many onto their roll, creating an
employment problem that they are trying to solve by taking market share
from the ragionieri.

NEW ZEALAND: AGREEMENT REACHED ON JOINT ED

As part of the commitment by New Zealand and Australia to harmonise
accounting standards, the two accounting standard-setting bodies have
agreed to issue a joint exposure draft (ED) on financial reporting by
Life Insurance companies.

April Mackenzie, director of Accounting and Professional Standards for
the New Zealand Accountants Society, said the main issue is taking the
ED jointly through the final stages. She compared the problems posed by
different regulatory requirements in each country, with those faced by
EU members when tackling harmonisation on other issues.

Mackenzie said that in developing financial reporting standards
particular notice is paid to the position of the International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). She believes the achievements of
the IASC will influence New Zealand accounting practices even more over
time.

IASC was represented at a meeting of delegates from standard-setting
bodies in Australia, UK and South Africa, hosted by the New Zealand
Society last year.

NEW ZEALAND: NEW CHEQUE LAW AFFECTS ACCOUNTANTS

New Zealand accountants can no longer deposit crossed non-negotiable
cheques, which are made out in the name of client, in their trust
accounts. Under new banking laws, crossed cheques now cannot be
endorsed for payment to another person and can only be paid into the
account of the named payee. This means accountants who receive payments
on behalf of clients have to make special arrangements to ensure they
can continue to bank the payments in their trust accounts. Preferably
they must ensure the cheque is made out to the accountancy firm instead
of in the client's name. Alternatively they must arrange for open
cheques.

A request to the New Zealand parliament seeking exemption for trust
account operators to continue depositing cheques made out to clients,
into their trust accounts was refused. The law-makers decided that to
give accountants and lawyers this exemption from the new law, would
weaken the protection now provided by the new non-transferable
regulations.

While admitting accountants will suffer some inconvenience, parliament
decided it was more important for the writer of a cheque to ensure it
was paid only to the payee.

In the past there was a widely held belief that crossing a cheque
prevented it from being endorsed and transferred to a person other than
the payee named. In fact under banking law which existed up to 1
January 1996, it did not.

The new law, aimed at preventing fraud says that now a crossed cheque
bearing the words 'Not transferable', 'Non transferable' or 'Account
payee' can only be paid to the named payee. Thieves will no longer be
able to cash stolen cheques by forging an endorsement to themselves or
to a third party.

Another provision of the new banking law is that banks no longer have
to physically transfer paper cheques to the branches on which they are
drawn. Now the details can be done electronically - cutting costs and
speeding up cheque clearance.

NEW ZEALAND: SHARING THE COST OF STANDARDS

The president of the New Zealand Accountants Society, Colin Notley,
agrees with those who argue that the cost of researching and developing
standards should be shared by the business community and others who
benefit from their application.

This argument, said Notley, has been given added strength because New
Zealand's Financial Reporting Standards, when approved by the
Accounting Standards Review Board, now carry legal backing.

'In one sense the Society's Financial Reporting Standards Board - which
does the preliminary work reviewing standards - has become a research
and working arm of government,' added Notley.

UNITED KINGDOM: 'EFFECTIVENESS' SHOULD GO SAYS APB

Interpretation of the word 'effectiveness' when asking directors to
report on internal financial control effectiveness is a sticking point,
according to the Auditing Practices Board (APB). The APB has released
the text of a letter it has sent to Sir Ronald Hampel, chairman of the
newly formed 'Committee on Corporate Governance', setting out its
principal conclusions following consultation concerning reporting by
auditors on the matter.

To build on progress made to date, the APB considers that the Hampel
Committee should:

- Consider further how best to report on internal financial control. In
particular there is the need either to define much more closely the
meaning of the term 'effectiveness' or consider whether there are other
options that would meet the spirit of the original Cadbury proposal but
avoid the need to interpret the term effectiveness. Announcing the APB
conclusions, APB chairman Ian Plaistowe said: 'We believe that auditors
will find it difficult to report on internal financial control
effectiveness unless words are changed. The APB would support words
along the lines of statements used by the BOC Group plc and The Coca-
Cola Company.' The report of the BOC Group directors states: 'The
directors believe that the Group's system of internal financial control
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are
safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded properly and that
material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be
detected within a timely period.'

- Study further the role of internal auditors in reporting on internal
control. The Cadbury Report did not deal, other than in passing
reference, with the role of internal audit. Internal auditors have an
integral part to play in any regime in which directors and auditors
report on internal controls. In particular, they are likely to consider
the wider concept of non-financial internal controls, whereas the work
of external auditors is focused more on internal financial controls.

The APB letter is a culmination of feedback and consultation which
began in December 1994 when the APB published Guidance for directors.
Implementation of the guidance has resulted in many listed companies
carrying out detailed reviews of their internal financial controls and
commentators believe that, as a result, controls are improving. The APB
held a public debate in June 1995, and in written responses to its
April 1995 discussion paper Internal financial control effectiveness,
commentators expressed strong reservations about the practicality of
auditors reporting on directors' opinions on the effectiveness of
internal financial controls. Philip Ashton, chairman of the APB
Internal Control Working Party said: 'Now the Hampel Committee is in
business, it is timely to look at the issues causing difficulty. Also 1
January 1996 was the date on which it became compulsory for directors
to report on internal controls.'

The APB also supports the majority of companies which responded to
Internal financial control effectiveness in calling for a two-year
moratorium on further reforms. 'This will give everyone an opportunity
to see the best way forward, particularly the Hampel Committee one it
gets fully underway,' said Plaistowe.

UNITED KINGDOM: ACCA SEEKS CHARTERED DESCRIPTION

The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) is one step
away from changing its name to the Association of Chartered Certified
Accountants, and calling its members chartered certified accountants.
The move follows a Privy Council decision, that in principle, it has no
objection to the inclusion of the term chartered in the descriptions of
members of any of the accountancy bodies which has a Royal Charter.

ACCA's Council will now seek the approval of members at the May 1996
AGM with a view to making a prompt application to the Privy Council.
Michael Harvey, ACCA's president said: 'The option chartered certified
accountant would enable the Association to retain the ACCA/FCCA
designation and build on the well-established certified brand.'

ACCA confirmed that from 1 January 1996, it is no longer a member of
the accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary scheme (JDS). ACCA
claims to have paid 27% (around #850,000) of the costs of running the
JDS compared to 12% when funding arrangements were agreed in the early
1980s, despite not having referred one of its 48,000 or so members in
over ten years.

UNITED KINGDOM: PURE CASHFLOW STATEMENT PROPOSED

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) proposes to introduce a pure
cashflow statements and to drop the present concept of cash
equivalents. FRED 10, Revision of FRS1 cashflow statements, states that
the definition of cash equivalents has been problematic because
treasury management practices can vary widely.

FRED 10 proposes that instead of including cash equivalents -
investments with repayment dates of up to three months, flows of cash
only would be measured - cash comprising cash in hand and deposits
repayable on demand, net of bank overdrafts. If the ASB's proposals are
adopted, the UK would be the only country to use pure cash as the basis
for preparing cashflow statements.

FRED 10 also proposes:

- A new section on management of liquid resources to provide improved
information on treasury activities.

- The order and headings for cashflows to be altered to accord more
closely with those most likely to be used in the directors' own
commentary.

- To tie the cashflow statement more closely into the balance sheet by
focusing on the effect of cashflows on the widely used financial
indicator 'net debt'.

Introducing the Exposure Draft, ASB chairman Sir David Tweedie said:
'The ASB believes that the changes represent a significant step forward
and will be of real benefit to both preparers and users of accounts.
Not the least of the improvements is the move to a pure cashflow
statement, which I am sure is a major advance.'

Comments on FRED 10 are invited by 8 March 1996.

COUNCILS APPROVE MERGER PROPOSALS

The Councils of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales (ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants
have circulated detailed merger proposals to their members for
consultation.

The consultative document, A vision of excellence, sets out the case
for merging the two bodies and explains the key benefits to members of
what it describes as a 'new world class structure'. These benefits
include:

- greater resources to counter increased competition from non-
accountants

- improved services for members and their clients

- increased influence with Government and the European Commission

- common high standards for students in business and practice

- lower subscriptions for many members.

Discussion events have been organised around the UK and overseas and
plans have been made to undertake extensive market research into the
merger. The consultation and research findings will help the Councils
decide whether to ask members to vote on the merger formally at a
Special Meeting in June of this year.

ICAEW president Keith Woodley said: 'I am delighted that our two
Councils have voted in favour of these proposals as I believe that this
is the right way forward for the profession.'

But an ICAEW member based at a Big 6 firm in London told WAR: 'This
would be a step backwards for the profession. Management accountants
will never be treated at the same level as chartered accountants.'

UNITED KINGDOM: EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ON CARDS

Nine out of ten small companies may be freed from all existing
accounting standards if proposals put forward by a working party of the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB) are implemented.
The CCAB working party on Big GAAP/Little GAAP's proposed new Financial
reporting standard for smaller enterprises, nicknamed 'Fresse', would
dramatically reduce the disclosure requirements in small companies.

Fresse, which would be issued alongside standards for larger companies,
would replace more than 600 pages of rules with a mere 40. It maintains
the measurement principles in existing standards although they have
been simplified in other areas, and will cover companies entitled to
make use of exemptions under the Companies Act.

Fresse would apply to companies with a turnover of less than #2.8m,
fewer than 50 employees or less than #1.4m of assets but not to

UNITED STATES: AMEX'S VICTORY ON FLORIDA LAW

American Express (Amex) Tax and Business Services prevailed in its
challenge of a Florida statute which prohibited the company's employees
from informing clients that they were Certified Public Accountants
(CPAs).

Previously, the Florida State Board of Accountancy only allowed CPAs to
advertise their certification if they were employed by a licensed
accounting firm with CPA ownership. As a corporation, Amex did not fit
that bill.

Amex's lawsuit against the state board claimed that the Florida statute
was a violation of its employees' constitutional right to free speech.
A Florida federal district court agreed with that charge and issued a
permanent injunction against the state enforcing its statute. 'Telling
consumers that our employees are qualified, trained CPAs is a
(constitutional) right,' said Sarah McKenzie, national director for
Amex. 'This information is important to consumers as they make choices
about their financial advisors.'

McKenzie said that statutes like Florida's were designed to insulate
traditional CPA firms from competition. Although the court's decision
pertains strictly to the state of Florida, she predicted it will have
far reaching effects on the accounting industry.

Florida's attorney general said that the State Board of Accountancy was
disappointed with the court's ruling and had not yet decided whether it
would appeal.

Amex employees provide accounting, tax and financial planning services,
but do not perform any attest functions. Audits and other attestation
engagements remain the sole province of licensed CPA firms.

UNITED STATES: ORANGE COUNTY CLAIMS KPMG WAS NEGLIGENT

Officials of bankrupt Orange County, California recently filed suit
against the county's former auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick. The lawsuit
claims that KPMG was negligent in performing its duties, that the firm
did not adequately warn county administrators of the high-risk nature
of certain investments.

Damages of up to $3bn are sought by Orange County. Defendants to the
action include KPMG partners and principals worldwide.

The negligence claim had been expected for several months. Earlier the
county had sued its former investment adviser, Merrill Lynch for a
similar amount.

KPMG officials said that the claim was just another attempt by the
county to hold someone else responsible for its investment losses. They
stressed that the firm was not hired as an investment adviser of the
county. KPMG's only role was to render judgement on the county's
financial statements and firm officials said the accounts accurately
portrayed Orange County finances.

UNITED STATES: BANKERS PRESS FASB FOR FAS 115 RELIEF

There is nothing like an interest rate swing to change a banker's
perspective.

During 1994, bankers were forced to make difficult decisions about
their investments. Implementing FAS 115, Accounting for certain
investments in debt and equity securities, required banks to classify
their investments as trading securities, available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity. Difference accounting rules applied to each class of
investments.

Some of the banks most volatile investments were classified as held-to-
maturity to insulate bank earnings from price fluctuations. Because of
the banks' stated intent to hold these investments, they were not
required to be written down to market values as bond prices plunged in
1994.

The interest rate scenario improved appreciable in 1995, however, as
did the value of the bankers' investments. So leading up to year-end
1995, bankers lobbied the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB),
for relief from their decisions of a year earlier. FASB accommodated
them by allowing a one-time reassessment and reclassification. Assets
in the held-to-maturity category were allowed to be moved into another
category between 15 November and 31 December 1995.
