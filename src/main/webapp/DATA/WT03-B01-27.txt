Blood Banking (Chagas Disease)
Donors with T. cruzi Pose Threat to Public Health


Trypanosoma cruzi (T.  cruzi), the cause of Chagas disease, may be a
considerable public health problem in parts of the United States.

Almost one in 5,700 blood donors in Miami, Florida and nearly one in 11,600 in
Los Angeles, California were seropositive for T.  cruzi antibodies in a
large-scale seroepidemiological study, said D.A.  Leiby, Transmissible
Diseases Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues
("Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma Cruzi-Antibodies in a Subpopulation of
American Red Cross Blood Donors," abstract 387, American Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):215).

"Despite the absence of demonstrated T.  cruzi transmission by transfusion,
the finding of seroreactive donors suggests that a significant public health
problem may exist," Leiby et al.  wrote in their presentation abstract.  They
presented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas, November 17-21, 1995.

The study was performed with the Southern California and the South Florida
Regions of the American Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories.

All volunteer blood donors in the Los Angeles and Miami Red Cross blood
centers were asked a question about their place of birth or amount of time
spent in regions endemic for T.  cruzi.  Those donors who answered "yes" and a
control group were tested for the presence of T.  cruzi antibodies by EIA
(manufactured by Abbott Laboratories).

The researchers confirmed by RIPA those samples that were repeatedly reactive
by EIA.  They then entered into case-control and look-back investigations
those donors who were confirmed T.  cruzi seroreactive.

Of the donors questioned about risk, 7.4 percent (14,480/196,832) in Los
Angeles and 11 percent (1,868/17,043) in Miami responded yes.  Of these who
answered affirmatively, 20 were confirmed by RIPA (17 donors in Los Angeles;
three in Miami).  Among these 20 individuals, the risk factor they all shared
was birth in and extended residence in a country endemic for T.  cruzi.

A look-back investigation of eight patients who previously had received blood
from the infected donors showed that none of the blood recipients had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi.

While none of the blood recipients in this particular study had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi infection, there are documented reports of
three cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States and
one case in Canada (according to a report by Ira A.  Schulman, M.D., Director
of Transfusion Medicine, LA County/USC Medical Center, delivered at the Blood
Safety & Screening Conference, October 23-25, 1995, Washington, D.C.).

Within the past 25 years, millions of immigrants have come to the United
States from countries where T.  cruzi is endemic.

Since 1991, an estimated 100,000 individuals infected with T.  cruzi reside in
North America.

Blood Banking (Donors)
January 1996 "National Volunteer Blood Donor Month"


The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), along with the American Red
Cross (ARC) and the Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC), announced that
President Bill Clinton has proclaimed January 1996 as "National Volunteer
Blood Donor Month."

Each year, approximately eight million volunteer donors give about 14 million
units of blood to those in need.  These units are transfused to as many as
four million patients annually.

"Society depends upon healthy blood donors who choose to graciously give of
themselves each day to help others.  The AABB applauds these civic-minded men
and women as 'heroes.' What greater gift can mankind share than that of
life-saving blood," said Roger K.  Svoboda, president, AABB.

In his proclamation, President Clinton declared, "Perhaps the most noble form
of charity is the gift we give anonymously to a stranger in need.  Donating
blood offers us this opportunity.  In a fast, safe, and simple procedure, we
can literally give life to someone in our community who is suffering from
illness or injury.  During this special month, I strongly encourage all my
fellow Americans who are able to do so to take an hour from their day to
donate blood."

For 1996, the AABB has chosen "Be a Hero.  Be a Blood Donor!"  as its campaign
theme.  The association will again have celebrity spokesperson, Carol Burnett,
encourage regular blood donations from healthy first-time and repeat donors.
Insurance giant MetLife, winner of the AABB 1994 Outstanding Achievement Award
for its promotion and support of blood donation on a nationwide basis, has
joined forces with AABB to promote "National Volunteer Blood Donor Month."

During January 1996, a MetLife print campaign will appear in nationally
syndicated newspapers of the Peanuts cartoon character Snoopy hoarding cookies
with the slogan, "Give Blood.  Get Cookies."

FACTS ABOUT BLOOD AND BLOOD BANKING

HOW MUCH BLOOD IS DONATED EACH YEAR?  HOW MUCH BLOOD IS TRANSFUSED EACH YEAR?
About 14 million units (including approximately one million autologous
donations) of blood are donated each year by approximately eight million
volunteer blood donors.  These units are transfused to as many as four million
patients per year.

A unit of whole blood is roughly equivalent to a pint.  Adult males have about
12 pints of blood in their circulatory systems, and adult females have
approximately nine pints.  Each unit is usually separated into multiple
components, which may be transfused to a number of different individuals.  Up
to four components can be derived from one unit of blood.

The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 40,000 units of
red blood cells are needed.  Accident cases, people undergoing surgery, and
patients receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or other diseases, such as
sickle cell disease and thalassemia, all utilize blood.  More than 23 million
units of blood components are transfused every year.

WHO DONATES BLOOD?  Less than 5 percent of healthy Americans eligible to
donate blood actually donate each year.

According to studies, the average donor is a college-educated white male,
between the ages of 30 and 50, who is married and has an above-average income.
However, these statistics are changing, and women and minority groups are
volunteering to donate in increasing numbers.

While persons 65 years and older compose 13 percent of the population, they
use 25 percent of all blood units transfused.  Using current screening and
donation procedures, a growing number of blood banks have found blood donation
by the elderly to be safe and practical.

WHERE IS BLOOD DONATED?  There are many places where blood donations can be
made.  Bloodmobiles travel to high schools, colleges, churches, and community
organizations.  People can also donate at community blood centers and
hospital-based donor centers.

Many people donate at blood drives at their place of work.  Community blood
centers collect approximately 88 percent of the nation's blood, and
hospital-based donor centers account for the other 12 percent.  Consult the
yellow pages to locate a nearby blood center or hospital to donate.

WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR BLOOD DONATION?  To be eligible to donate blood, a
person must generally be at least 17 years of age (although some states permit
younger people to donate with parental consent); be in good health; and weigh
at least 110 pounds.  Most blood banks have no upper age limit.  All donors
must pass the physical and health history examinations given prior to
donation.

Nearly all blood used for transfusion in the United States is drawn from
volunteer donors.  The donor's body replenishes the fluid lost from donation
in 24 hours.  It may take up to two months to replace the lost red blood
cells.  Whole blood can be donated every eight weeks.

An increasingly common procedure is apheresis, or the process of removing a
specific component of the blood and returning the red blood cells to the
donor.  This process allows more of a particular component - platelets, for
instance - to be drawn in one sitting than could be separated from a unit of
whole blood.  Apheresis is also performed to collect plasma and granulocytes.

WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON BLOOD TYPE?  The approximate distribution of blood
types in the U.S.  population is as follows.  Distribution may be different
for specific racial and ethnic groups:

*  O    Rh-positive    38 percent
*  O    Rh-negative    7 percent
*  A    Rh-positive    34 percent
*  A    Rh-negative    6 percent
*  B    Rh-positive    9 percent
*  B    Rh-negative    2 percent
*  AB    Rh-positive    3 percent
*  AB    Rh-negative    1 percent

In an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells, and type AB
individuals can receive red blood cells of any ABO group.  Therefore, people
with type O blood are known as "universal donors" and those with AB blood as
universal recipients."

WHAT TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON DONATED BLOOD?  After blood is drawn, it is tested
for ABO group and Rh type, as well as for any unexpected antibodies that may
cause problems in the recipient.  Screening tests are also performed for
hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)
and the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and for antibodies to HIV (anti-HIV-1
and HIV-2), the human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and syphilis.

HOW IS BLOOD STORED AND USED?  Each unit of blood is normally separated into
several components.  Red blood cells may be stored under refrigeration for a
maximum of 42 days, or they may be frozen for up to ten years.  Red cells
carry oxygen and are commonly used to treat anemia.

Platelets are important in the control of bleeding and are used in patients
with leukemia and other forms of cancer.  Platelets may be kept for a maximum
of five days.  Granulocytes established.  They must be transfused within 24
hours of donation.  Plasma, used to control bleeding, is usually kept in the
frozen state for up to one year.  Cryoprecipitated AHF, which contains
clotting factors, is made from fresh-frozen plasma and may be stored frozen
for one year.

Other products manufactured from blood include albumin, immune globulin,
specific immune globulins and clotting factor concentrates.  These blood
products are commonly made by commercial manufacturers.

HOW MUCH DOES BLOOD COST?  While donated blood is free, and most blood
collecting organizations (blood centers as well as collecting hospitals) are
not-for-profit, there are significant costs associated with collecting,
storing, testing, and transfusing blood.  As a result, processing fees are
charged to recover costs.  Processing fees for red blood cells vary and may be
more than $100 per unit in certain parts of the country.  The national average
is between $65 and $75.  Other components may be more expensive.

Transplantation (BMT)
HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors Are Good Option for CML Patients


Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donors
(VUDs) can cure a significant number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML).

For patients with CML, allogeneic BMT is established as an effective means to
restore normal hematopoiesis.  However, the lack of a suitable HLA-identical
sibling has led to more frequent use of VUDs.  Compared with HLA-identical
sibling donor BMT, VUD BMT has been associated with greater morbidity and
mortality, especially because of greater rates of graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and graft failure.

Andrew Spencer, Leukemia Research Fund Center for Adult Leukemia, Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London, England, and colleagues performed an
analysis of the outcome of VUD BMT in 115 patients with CML at their
institution ("Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with
Volunteer Unrelated Donors Using Ex Vivo or In Vivo T-Cell Depletion:  Major
Prognostic Impact of HLA Class I Identity between Donor and Recipient," Blood,
1995;86(9):3590-3597).

Their aim was to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from VUD
BMT.

"We have demonstrated that VUD BMT can cure a significant number of
appropriately selected patients with CML," wrote Spencer et al.  They added
that the availability of high-resolution tissue typing techniques enables more
accurate predictions of outcome after VUD BMT.  The use of such methods should
allow the more appropriate use of VUD BMT in managing CML.

"In young, chronic phase patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling, a search for
an unrelated donor should be commenced immediately," wrote Spencer et al.  "If
a potential donor, matched using high-resolution typing techniques, is
identified, BMT should be considered as soon as possible."

Spencer et al.  performed 115 VUD BMT for first chronic phase or advanced
phase CML between August 1985 and July 1994.  They supplemented standard
serologic HLA typing of recipients and potential donors with one-dimensional
isoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQ
alleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and
the measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay).

The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at three years was 37 percent.  The
probabilities of survival and LFS for patients under the age of 40 years who
were transplanted in the first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73
percent and 50 percent, respectively.

"We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; when
using ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved in
patients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors without
demonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency," wrote Spencer et
al.

The current study showed an association between graft failure and increasing
donor age that has not been recognized before.  The graft failure rate of 16
percent reported by Spender et al.  corresponds to that reported by other
researchers (McGlave et al., Blood, 1990;75:1728; McGlave et al., Blood,
1993;81:543).

Researchers have indicated that about two-thirds of patients, otherwise
eligible for BMT, lack a matched sibling donor (Beatty et al.,
Transplantation, 1988;45:714).

The corresponding author for this study is Andrew Spencer, LRF Centre for
Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Du Cane Road, London W12
ONN, United Kingdom.

Transplantation (Cord Blood)
Improved Methods Address Storage and Cell Viability Challenges


Recent processing improvements should make frozen placental/umbilical cord
blood (PCB) a more useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow
reconstitution.

Pablo Rubinstein and colleagues, Lindsley F.  Kimball Research Institute of
the New York Blood Center, New York, New York, addressed two key requirements
for moving unrelated-donor PCB transplantation forward as a practical
alternative for clinical use ("Processing and Cryopreservation of
Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood for Unrelated Bone Marrow Reconstitution,"
Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1995;92(22):10119-10122).

First, they developed a method that maximizes freezer storage space by
concentrating the hematopoietic cells of PCB units into units of smaller
volume.  Second, they developed a method to overcome loss of viability
associated with cryopreservation and thawing.

In the unrelated donor/recipient setting, human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients.  This requires
the establishment of large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units, noted
Rubinstein et al.  This effort typically involves a large volume of
unprocessed PCB units consisting primarily of red blood cells, plasma and
cryopreservation medium, which take up limited, expensive frozen storage space
in liquid nitrogen.

Rubinstein et al.  designed a closed-system procedure, compatible with routine
blood bank processing, that concentrates almost all the leukocytes and
progenitor cells in PCB units.  The procedure is based on a hydroxyethyl
starch (HES)-induced rouleaux formation and mild centrifugation to separate a
leukocyte-rich supernatant from sedimented red blood cells.

"Since the probability of finding an HLA-matched unit depends on the number of
units available and since the number of units that can be stored in a given
space is determined by the average unit volume, smaller PCB units are
essential for PCB to become a practical source of tissue for unrelated
transplantation," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Decreasing the volume of PCB units by removing the bulk of red blood cells and
plasma offers practical advantages such as convenience, cost and efficiency,
compared with current options.

The second issue - reduced cell viability after the cryopreserved PCB units
are thawed - was diminished by adding one volume of isotonic diluent to the
cell suspension in 10 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Dilution of the freshly thawed cryopreserved unit with an equal volume of
isotonic solution allows the product to be thawed and prepared for infusion
under controlled laboratory conditions instead of at the patient's bedside,
noted the researchers.

"Removal of the cryoprotective medium can be performed there [the laboratory
setting], without harm to the units:  clonogenic activity and viability remain
essentially unchanged, even if removal of diluted DMSO is delayed for several
hours," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Removing DMSO eliminates its unfavorable side effects on the recipient
(Stroncek et al., Transfusion, 1991;31:521-526; Davis et al., Blood,
1990;75:781-786).

"These improvements make frozen PCB a more effective source of stem cells for
unrelated marrow reconstitution in the treatment of inherited disease and
hematologic malignancy and, potentially, for recombinant DNA-based gene
therapy," wrote Rubinstein et al.

The same procedure to minimize loss of viability might be used in the
cryopreservation process for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem and
progenitor cells.  It also may be possible to remove malignant cells or to
introduce chemical or genetic labels into cells before infusion.

Numerous advantages in using PCB as donor tissue for unrelated bone marrow
restoration have been reported, including timely availability of PCB to
patients and lower frequency of certain infections, as described in an earlier
published review (Rubinstein et al., Blood, 1993;7:1679-1690).

Another significant advantage of PCB grafts is their remarkably lower
incidence of associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (Sullivan,
in Bone Marrow Transplantation, eds.  Forman, Blume & Thomas, 1994, Blackwell,
Boston, pp.  339-362).

In February 1993 the New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Project started
collecting PCB units to study the clinical usefulness of this source of stem
cells (Rubinstein, Blood Cells, 1994;20:587-600).  Of the 24 patients who
received PCB grafts before February 26, 1995, 12 still were alive and doing
well as of March 30, 1995.  None of the recipients developed clinically severe
GVHD within follow-up periods of 2 to 18 months.

This work was supported in part by Grant HL 48031 from the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and by grants
from Baxter Health Care and Citibank.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Emerging Diseases
Could Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?


Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animals
are imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) researchers warn.

Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only one
or two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domestic
animals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recent
programs to vaccinate wild animals.

This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention program
costs an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expenses
per year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recent
publication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public Health
Concern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).

But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.
are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidental
or intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise the
animal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from various
species of bats.

"Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccine
failures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter of
potentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequently
established in susceptible bat populations."

Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically related
negative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are the
rhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and some
isolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:

* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.
suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was first
isolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outside
Ibadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.
Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Central
African Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented human
infections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.

* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.
Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, in
Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, and
Ethiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginal
protection.

* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but is
suspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, South
Africa who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by a
bat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.
Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human case
was documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus has
been found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have been
identified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus was
first identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of a
rabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domestic
animals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

"The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New World
mitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy bats
without human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, several
recent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer of
rabies-infected bats."

These events include:

* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in research
facilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosed
with rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild big
brown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died of
rabies.

* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on a
container ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.

* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permits
in 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptian
tomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or their
offspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions or
zoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normally
subjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported bats
to prevent contact with humans.

"Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,
active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.
warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the area
that extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,
and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in a
wide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction with
other Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolon
helvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of these
species have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa.

"The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern because
of the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,
particularly in the southern United States."

Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to the
United States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior to
European colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxes
for the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.

When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillance
revealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 human
deaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960
rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.

From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but they
were then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infected
animals from southern states.

Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies has
changed.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after a
known exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975
advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in people
who had no history of an animal bite.

"Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that was
unrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"
Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has also
changed:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involved
rabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."

As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.
noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000
submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after the
epizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state.

"The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000
to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability
of rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.

"What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account the
psychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequent
euthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.
Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the United
States, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."

Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue strongly
against population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,
economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programs
for wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC.

"Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is an
integral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,
where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5
million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabies
incidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for human
rabies."

However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required an
extensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective for
foxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes.

"In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine was
developed that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons and
various other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improved
thermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.
"When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact with
them by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,
studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,
or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate species
examined."

An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, New
Jersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baits
laced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and by
helicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantly
reduced.

Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there are
many questions yet to be answered:

* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?

* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?

* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?

* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabies
control in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?

* Who will fund these programs over time?

* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?

"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue of
extending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing world
will be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.

Encephalitis
Microsphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis Vaccine


Mouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against a
deadly form of viral encephalitis.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the family
Togaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infections
during epizootics among horses.

The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidad
donkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans and
animals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidence
suggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,
there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.

The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.
While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuated
vaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.

Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEE
virus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported their
results in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses to
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"
Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20).

"The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responses
which were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virus
vaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was more
effective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective against
systemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."

Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as a
means of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to see
the potential benefits of this technology.

"Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number of
inoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oral
vaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieve
immune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center for
Immunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,
January 1994;12(1):5-11).

Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams have
shown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effective
vehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered either
mucosally or systemically.

Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe in
humans.

Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEE
virus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that of
free virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.

Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yielded
anti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.

When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received a
second booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stable
throughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane only
in mice boosted with free virus.

"At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared with
either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducing
specific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondary
immunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5
(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processed
microspheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary and
secondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced the
immunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during the
microencapsulation procedure."

In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better than
non-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres.

"Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior to
microencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhanced
the immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhanced
conformational stability," they wrote.

In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5
(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survived
challenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received the
free virus vaccine survived challenge.

"At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccines
afforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigen
resulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival in
a second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote.

"These results, taken together with the protection results after secondary
immunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicate
that a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could afford
protection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the free
virus vaccine."

The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulated
VEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosol
challenge with virulent VEE virus.

Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama 35294.

Human Papillomavirus (Diagnostics)
Serum Antibody to HPV-16 VLPs Indicates Cervical HPV-16 Infection


Serum antibody to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) virus-like particles
(VLPs) could be useful in epidemiology studies and for surveillance.

Louise Wideroff, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues
evaluated an ELISA to detect serum IgG antibody response to HPV-16 VLPs
("Evaluation of Seroreactivity to Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Virus-like
Particles in an Incident Case-Control Study of Cervical Neoplasia," Journal of
Infectious Diseases, December 1995;172:1425-1430).  They used sera collected
from an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia and compared
serologic results with established DNA markers of cervical HPV-16 infection.

Serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator of
persisting cervical HPV-16 infection, based on data from the study.

The study included 688 individuals with continued normal cytology (control
group) and 152 patients with confirmed incident squamous intraepithelial
lesions.  The patients were tested for DNA of a broad spectrum of HPV types at
the beginning of the study and at follow-up.

"Of controls, 16.6 percent were seropositive compared with 30.8 percent and
52.4 percent of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively," wrote
Wideroff et al.  "Seropositivity increased from 22.2 percent in subjects who
were HPV-16 DNA positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment or
follow-up) to 83.3 percent in those who were HPV-16 DNA positive at both time
points."

Because the potential validity of any HPV serologic marker depends on how
valid an indicator it is of exposure to viral antigens, it is essential to pay
close attention to establishing the marker's validity before it is used as a
clinical or research tool, the authors noted.

HPV of differing genotypes encode a range of capsid and nonstructural proteins
that are immunogenic in the infected individual, and efforts to characterize
the host immune response to the antigens have targeted, in part, on
establishing in human sera the prevalence of anti-HPV antibodies.

Challenges associated with culturing HPV to obtain viral antigens by
traditional methods have lead to the development of alternative antigen
sources in order to perform host immune response studies.  Wideroff et al.
noted that such sources include recombinant bacterial fusion proteins,
synthetic peptides and virions produced in xenograft and raft systems.  Empty
capsids, referred to as VLPs, serve as another source of antigen.  VLPs
self-assemble in eukaryotic cells that are infected with HPV expression
vectors, such as baculovirus (Kirnbauer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,
1992;89:12180-12184; Rose et al., J Virol, 1993;67:1936-1944; Hagensee et al.,
J Virol, 1993;67:315-322; Kirnbauer et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6929-6936).

Previously reported research studies have demonstrated that self-assembled
HPV-16 L1 plus L2 VLPs, expressed in insect cells via baculovirus vectors, are
capable of detecting anti-HPV-16 IgG antibody in serum by ELISA (Kirnbauer et
al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-499; Galloway, J Natl Cancer Inst,
1994;86:474-475).

"In epidemiologic applications, serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs could be a
useful end point biomarker in studies to determine risk factors for HPV
transmission," wrote Wideroff et al.  "It could also be considered an exposure
biomarker to assess immunologic risk factors for HPV-associated disease or as
a surrogate for viral infection itself when biologic samples are unavailable
for DNA testing."

The HPV serologic marker also could be beneficial as a surveillance tool for
estimating the population prevalence of HPV-16 exposure and to inspect
geographic variation and time trends in HPV associated infection, they added.

The HPV-16 serologic assay has been patented by contributing authors J.
Schiller, R.  Kirnbauer and D.  Lowy.  Contributing authors A.  Lorincz and
M.M.  Manos serve as scientific director and consultant, respectively, for
Digene Diagnostics and Information Management Services, Silver Spring,

Industry News (Blood Substitutes)
Hemolink Phase II Trials to Begin in 1996


A red blood cell substitute will go into Phase II clinical trials early in
1996 and, if all goes well, could be available on the market by 1999.

The announcement was made at the 1995 International Chemical Congress of
Pacific Basin Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995.

The blood substitute, Hemolink, manufactured by Hemosol, is made of chemically
modified hemoglobin, says Dr.  Gord Adamson, a company scientist.  Hemolink is
derived from screened and tested blood that is outdated because it has been
stored for more than six weeks.

Hemosol takes the expired blood, separates out the red blood cells and
extracts the hemoglobin.  That's more complicated than it sounds.  "A red cell
is not just a package of clean hemoglobin," Adamson says.  "It contains about
90 different proteins."  The company heat-treats the hemoglobin to destroy any
contaminating viruses that may have eluded the screening process conducted by
collection agencies.  Other remaining proteins are then removed by a novel
displacement chromatographic process.

The process strips away blood-group antigens and other proteins, so Hemolink
can be used by all patients regardless of blood type.  And the purification
steps make the likelihood of transmission of diseases such as HIV and
hepatitis "virtually" nil, according to Adamson.

"The reason we say 'virtually,"' he notes, "is because scientifically it is
impossible to prove total absence of a virus," but he is very confident that
Hemolink would pose no threat to users in terms of blood-borne diseases.  In
addition, the blood from which Hemolink is derived is already approved for
use; the company does not accept contaminated units.

After purification, the free hemoglobin is cross-linked with oxidized
raffinose, a sugar molecule.  This "improves the ability of the free
hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to tissue, stabilizes each hemoglobin molecule
and links together several such molecules so that they are large enough to
circulate for extended periods," Adamson says.

Human trials with Hemolink show the blood substitute circulates for a couple
of days in the blood stream - compared with a month or more for transfused red
cells - and is then excreted, says Adamson.  But animal trials show this is
long enough to counteract oxygen shortages during acute blood loss, say, in an
accident or an operation.  In fact, these trials showed that animals treated
with Hemolink did just as well as those treated with transfusions of the
animals' own blood.

Hemosol is currently working with two versions of Hemolink, one a fluid stored
in a refrigerator and one frozen.  Either formulation would be suitable for
surgical applications.  A long-term goal is to develop a freeze-dried
formulation.  It would be light enough to ship to remote depots - for use in
disasters or military conflicts, for example - and it could be reconstituted
with sterile water on-site.

Adamson believes the cost for Hemolink would be competitive, noting that there
are significant administrative costs associated with the existing blood
collection and distribution system.  These include the storage, transport,
disposal and other labor and record-keeping activities that a successful blood
substitute would significantly reduce.  Also, since no cross-matching would be
required, these costs would be saved.

Hemolink also would avoid some of the costly problems associated with blood
transfusions - such as transmission of disease (ranging from HIV or hepatitis
to a bacterial infection), or mismatched blood (where the patient might have a
reaction to antigens in the donor's blood that could be mild, such as a fever,
or severe, resulting in death), or the delays in surgery brought about by
blood shortages.

Hemosol will not rely just on Hemolink to launch itself in this market.  The
company is collaborating with Ronald Kluger, a chemistry professor with the
University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to further extend cross-linking
technologies for second-generation products.

Adamson says the work also is aimed at chemically modifying hemoglobin so it
can serve as a carrier for drug molecules.  Tissues that can accumulate and
metabolize protein-drug conjugates are potential targets.  An example is a
solid tumor.  Adamson says this would reduce many of the side-effects of
anti-tumor agents.

A large-scale conversion from red cells to blood substitutes is unrealistic,
particularly in the short term, Adamson says.  But assuming they win approval,
blood substitutes could ultimately bring in big money.  Industry estimates of
the potential market for blood substitutes (and newer applications where red
cells can't be used) by the year 2002 are around 1.5 million units (worth
US$500 million) in North America, and over three million units worldwide,
Hemosol says.

PEG-Hemoglobin Cleared for Multi-Dose/Multi-Center Trial in Cancer Patients 


Enzon, Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey, announced that it has received clearance
from the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin a multi-dose,
multi-center clinical trial of its hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier,
PEG-hemoglobin, in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.

The study, in patients with various advanced solid tumors, will primarily
evaluate safety related to multiple doses of PEG-hemoglobin and, secondarily,
tumor response to the combination therapy of radiation and PEG-hemoglobin.

There are two million cases of cancer diagnosed annually, according to the
American Cancer Society.  Approximately 800,000 of these cases involve solid
tumors which are now treated with radiation.  By delivering oxygen,
PEG-hemoglobin should sensitize solid tumors which may enhance response to
radiation therapy.  This process, termed "radiosensitization", may provide a
combination treatment of solid tumors, which is more effective than radiation
therapy alone.

The FDA, in a "Points to Consider" bulletin, suggested that the oxygenation of
solid tumors would be important supportive evidence for clinical efficacy of
hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers.  In response to that bulletin, Enzon
scientists have developed a clinical program focused on radiosensitization.
The company believes that PEG-hemoglobin is the only hemoglobin-based oxygen
carrier in clinical development for this indication.

Pre-clinical studies conducted at Enzon, Harvard University's Dana Farber
Cancer Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the University of Wisconsin,
Veterinary School of Medicine, demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin enhanced the
effectiveness of radiation therapy and significantly reduced tumors in both
implanted animal models, as well as animal patients exhibiting spontaneous
tumors.

In February 1995, Enzon initiated a safety study with PEG-hemoglobin in 28
healthy volunteers.  The maximum dose administered was equivalent to 1.5 units
of whole blood.  The study, which was completed in September 1995,
demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin in its active form, circulates in the blood
for approximately eleven days.

Patients will receive a once-a-week dose of PEG-hemoglobin for each five days
of radiation treatment during a three-week therapy program.  The dose level
will be dependent on body weight, but will be significantly less than the
highest dose used in the previous safety study.  The company also believes
that a sufficient amount of PEG-hemoglobin remains in the blood to properly
oxygenate tumors and optimize radiation therapy during the five day course of
treatment.

"This approval represents a significant advancement in our PEG-hemoglobin
program," stated Peter G.  Tombros, Enzon's president and chief executive
officer.  "We have worked closely with the FDA to develop this protocol."

At this time, Enzon will dedicate its manufacturing capability exclusively to
the production of PEG-hemoglobin to produce additional clinical materials and
complete commercial process development.  The existing facility at the present
scale is adequate to supply all PEG-hemoglobin needed for clinical trials up
to FDA approval.

Industry News (Joint Venture)
Anticancer Drug Licensing/Research Agreement Signed


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, and EntreMed, Inc.,
Rockville, Maryland, announced an agreement in which Bristol-Myers Squibb will
obtain exclusive worldwide licensing rights to antiangiogenic compounds now in
development by EntreMed, Inc.

Antiangiogenic therapies, which have been shown in preclinical studies to
prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels, have the potential to block
the growth of primary and metastatic cancers by eliminating a tumor's blood
supply.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has made an equity
investment in EntreMed and will fund a five-year research collaboration in the
area of angiogenesis and its application in the treatment of cancer.  In
return, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain worldwide licensing rights to the
recently discovered antiangiogenic applications of the drugs thalidomide,
thalidomide analogs and Angiostatin protein, which have generated considerable
interest in the medical community.

Angiostatin is a novel protein which may suppress malignant tumor formation by
inhibiting the growth of blood vessels.  In preclinical trials, it has
successfully caused the regression of primary human breast, prostate, and
colon tumors in animal models.

Thalidomide, developed as a sedative, has not been approved in the U.S., and
it was originally associated with birth defects.  However, if it is shown to
be an effective antiangiogenic therapy in humans, it has the potential to
become a significant anticancer agent.  There are currently no antiangiogenic
products approved for the treatment of cancer.

Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, M.D., director of the
Surgical Research Laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,
and professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Folkman was the
first to observe that cancerous tissues are fed by newly-grown blood vessels
sprouting from existing arteries.

He theorized that if doctors could prevent these blood vessels from growing,
then the tumor would starve.  Since Children's Hospital has a sponsored
research agreement with EntreMed, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain first
refusal rights on any antiangiogenic technologies developed in Folkman's
laboratory and licensed by EntreMed.

It is expected that the first clinical trials to test the antiangiogenic
properties of these compounds in cancer will begin in 1996.  EntreMed has
already initiated clinical trials with thalidomide in the treatment of
blindness due to age-related macular degeneration, another angiogenic
disorder.

Marketing Agreement Announced for Cancer Test


Biomira Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and Immunex Corporation, Seattle,
Washington, announced a co-promotion agreement for Truquant BR RIA, Biomira's
blood test for the detection of recurrent breast cancer.

As part of this co-promotion plan, Polymedco Inc., Cortlandt Manor, New York,
will continue as Biomira's exclusive distributor for this product in the U.S.
Biomira's Truquant BR in vitro test kit has recently received an approvable
letter and is awaiting marketing clearance from the U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), which is expected during the first quarter of 1996.

The Truquant BR kit is the first and only blood test clinically proven to be a
significant and independent predictor of recurrence of breast cancer in women
with Stage II and Stage III disease.  There are more than one million women in
the United States who have been diagnosed with Stage II and Stage III breast
cancer.

Truquant BR test detects the presence in the blood of the CA27.29 antigen, a
breast cancer tumour marker.  The Truquant BR kit is under expedited FDA
review.  On September 21, 1995, the FDA received a unanimous recommendation
for approval from its Immunology Devices Advisory Panel for Biomira's Truquant
BR test.  The company has completed all conditions in the approvable letter
from the FDA, other than a site inspection which is anticipated in the first
quarter of 1996.

Preventive Medicine
Experts Call for More Counseling/Better Screening


A task force of prominent preventive health specialists recommended that
doctors and nurses offer more frequent patient counseling on personal health
and safety habits, significantly change the use of some screening tests, and
ensure that several newer immunizations are routinely provided.

The U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel first convened
in 1984 as an initiative of the U.S.  Public Health Service, issued the first
revision of its widely used 1989 guide to effective disease prevention and
health promotion, based on a careful review of scientific evidence.

Many of the recommended changes in the 1995 "Guide to Clinical Preventive
Services, 2nd Edition" reflect new evidence about important health benefits of
selected preventive services.  Other changes reflect a more critical look at
the balance of harms and benefits of screening tests now in wide use.  The
report also reaffirms many of the disease and injury prevention practices
recommended in 1989.

In accepting the report from the Task Force, Philip R.  Lee, M.D., Assistant
Secretary for Health, noted that "Effective disease and injury prevention is
our most efficient tool for improving our health status as individuals and as
a nation.  This report, like its predecessor, moves us further toward
prevention that works."

The ten-member Task Force rejected the traditional emphasis on a standardized
annual physical examination as an effective tool for improving the health of
patients.  Instead, they emphasized that the content and the frequency of the
periodic health exam need to be tailored to the age, health risks and
preferences of each patient.

The panel recognized the proven benefits of specific measures such as periodic
screening for high blood pressure and cervical cancer, scheduled vaccinations,
and counseling about tobacco, alcohol and other lifestyle issues.  In
contrast, the Task Force found little evidence of important benefits from
other tests often included in routine check-ups, such as blood tests for
diabetes, thyroid diseases or anemia, chest X- rays, electrocardiograms and
urine tests.

According to Task Force Chair, Dr.  Harold C.  Sox, Jr., Chair of Medicine at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, "Our review affirms the effectiveness of a
variety of preventive interventions, many of which are underutilized in
routine practice.  At the same time, other widely used preventive practices,
many of which are costly and some of which are even dangerous, show little or
no evidence that they improve health.  We based our recommendations on the
scientific evidence.  All too often, the evidence was too weak for us to make
a strong recommendation.  We need to strengthen the evidence on which our
prevention practices rest."

Although none of the recommendations depended on cost, the Task Force noted
the considerable cost of the widespread use of many unproven tests and
procedures, such as routine electrocardiograms in healthy adults and
ultrasound scans in low-risk pregnancies.

The Task Force included specialists in family medicine, internal medicine,
obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and preventive medicine.  Over 30
outside experts in medicine, nursing, public health, epidemiology, and health
promotion and education also contributed to the project.

The Task Force assessed more than 6,000 studies of over 200 different
interventions for more than 70 diseases and conditions.  These included 53
screening tests (for cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic and nutritional
diseases, infectious diseases, vision and hearing disorders, prenatal
disorders, congenital disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders
and substance abuse); 11 counseling topics ranging from promoting seat belt
use to preventing tobacco use; immunization against 12 common childhood and
adult diseases; and the use of aspirin and postmenopausal hormones to prevent
disease.

The report draws several broad conclusions about effective preventive care:

* Counseling patients about personal health practices (smoking, diet, physical
activity, drinking, and injury prevention and sexual practices) remains one of
the most underused, but important, parts of the health visit.

* Preventive services offered by the clinician should be tailored to the
specific behaviors and risk factors of individual patients, not offered as a
standard "routine checkup" given to all patients.

* Patients should share in decisions about preventive services.  Their
personal preferences are important in determining an approach to prevention
that is optimal for them as individuals.  This is especially true when the
evidence of benefit is weak.

* Doctors and nurses should try to deliver prevention messages and services
during every encounter with their patients, especially for high- risk patients
who are often the least likely to see clinicians for routine checkups.

The following are examples of new or revised recommendations:

* In favor of flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or annual fecal occult blood testing
to screen for colorectal cancer.

* In favor of targeting routine screening for high cholesterol and other lipid
disorders to men aged 35 to 65 and women 45 to 65, and others at increased
risk for heart disease.

* Against routine screening for prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen
(PSA) or digital rectal examination.

* Against routine urine tests for early detection of bladder cancer or
asymptomatic urinary tract infection.

* In favor of daily multivitamins with folic acid for all women who can become
pregnant (to prevent neural tube defects).

* In favor of routinely vaccinating all newborns, children, adolescents and
young adults against hepatitis B.

* In favor of routine vaccination of children against chickenpox.

* In favor of counseling parents of young children on measures to reduce the
risk of household and recreational injuries.

* In favor of discussing the use of estrogen therapy with all postmenopausal
women.

Tissue Banking
Storage of Tissues Leads to Ethical Dilemmas


If you've ever had a biopsy, do you know what happened to that sample of your
own tissue after the tests were completed?  There is a possibility that, even
without your knowledge, it ended up in a "bank" where human tissue and fluids
are collected for future use.

As Dr.  Eike-Henner Kluge of the University of Victoria in British Columbia,
Canada, told the 1995 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin
Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995, "If I get hold of
your DNA, I know a lot about you, and in fact, I can identify you.  Is it an
invasion of privacy?  Kluge answers that laws regarding the protection of
privacy never looked at this area, because it didn't exist at the time the
laws were enacted."

Yet from a healthcare perspective, the establishment of a human tissue bank
can be very beneficial.  Kluge asserts that with a proper collection policy
for a tissue bank, "observations at the cellular level over a period of time,
starting with base-line studies, will allow you to identify health issues
before they reach an acute stage of toxicity.  We're beginning to see
ecological changes that reflect themselves in the tissue changes in human
beings."

Although tissue banks have existed in several countries for several decades,
the collection policy is quite haphazard.  "There is no organized way of
getting this data," Kluge contends, "or integrating the data and then doing
something with it.  We really don't have a handle on it at the human level at
all."

Getting a handle on the commercial impact may be even more difficult.  Kluge
points to one case where "cancerous liver cells were used to develop a strain
of biological products where the profit after expenses runs into the billions
of dollars."  When a state court was asked to settle the cell ownership
question, it ruled in favor of the physicians who had developed the commercial
venture rather than the individual who had been the source of the cells.

To Kluge, the problem "is very simple.  We have no international law dealing
with the collection, disposition, and use of human tissue and fluids in these
banks.  And no country has any law that really nails down who may have access
to it, who may use it for what uses, who has ownership and who has right of
disposition."

As a medical ethicist and former Director of Ethics and Legal Affairs of the
Canadian Medical Association, Kluge contends that "one has to look at the
ethics to try and develop some guidelines which are not only national, but
also international, because once the banks are established, the transfer of
tissue and fluids is international.  One then has to deal with different
cultures, different legal systems, and different kinds of perspectives of what
is appropriate and what is not appropriate."

According to Kluge, there are two possible approaches.  One of them is at the
United Nations level, "which gives rise to international conventions where
subscribers are bound by the regulations of the convention."  Another is a
"professional code of ethics, where violators would be subject to professional
sanctions."

Kluge's approach is not to look at existing law, but to look at the ethics of
the situation, especially in terms of who owns the tissue.  In a sense it is a
foundational approach which might be used as a model independent of the legal
tradition."  One option that Kluge intends to explore is to "work the relevant
ethical considerations into trade agreements, as was done with medical
informatics requirements in the European Economic Community.  That would be
particularly relevant in light of the new Pacific - Asian Rim Free Trade
initiative."

"Otherwise," Kluge warns, "if you don't do this right, you're going to have a
mess for the next fifty years."

Xenotransplantation
Baboon BMT Experiment a Reality


Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Structured
Biologicals Inc.  (SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBI
sponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon to
an AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.

On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an
experimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on the
experiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneering
AIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.

The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division of
Cellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadt
discovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates the
risk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfully
fights transplant rejection.

Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that the
uninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow to
restore the patient's immune function.

The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change the
practice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanent
acceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver as
well as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matching
or prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmune
diseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,
Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and may
ultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-species
transplantation).

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific

December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "Anticoagulant therapy in patients
with pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis (or patients at risk for
thromboembolic disease) is indicated to limit disease progression and prevent
recurrence.  Anticoagulant levels must be carefully monitored to maintain
therapeutic dosages.  High drug levels can result in a variety of
complications that increase patient morbidity and mortality.  The clinical and
radiographic appearances of these complications may be overlooked or confused
with other pathologic processes, and this may result in unnecessary work-up
and delay proper therapy.  This exhibit presents the spectrum of complications
of anticoagulant-related bleeding as documented with CT.  Potential pitfalls
in diagnosis as well as the role of CT in management are discussed."

Histologic Features of Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in Adults."  N.  Assy and

Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg,
Manitoba.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "We assessed the predictive value of age,
gender, route of transmission, extent of steatosis, alcohol consumption and
aminotransferase values (ALT, AST) on the histologic findings of 79 adult
patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infections.  The mean (+/-SD) age of
the patient population was 43.5 +/- 10.8 years of which 60% were male.  The
route of transmission was considered to be parenteral drugs in 56%, previous
blood transfusions in 32% and various non-parenteral routes in 13%.  RESULTS:
The mean histologic activity score of the group as described by Desmet et al.
was 3.5 +/- 0.8 and fibrosis score 1.5 +/- 0.4.  The extent of inflammation
correlated with fibrosis (r=0.72).  By multivariate stepwise regression
analyses, the AST emerged as the most important predictor variable of
histologic activity (P<0.00001).  When overall histologic activity was
separated into-portal inflammation, piecemeal necrosis and lobular activity,
significant correlations existed between AST values and portal inflammation
(P<0.0001) and piecemeal necrosis (P<0.005) but not lobular activity (P=0.9).
A strong correlation was also observed between AST values and the extent of
hepatic fibrosis (P<0.0001).  On the other hand, ALT values did not correlate
with histologic activity but did correlate with the extent of hepatic fibrosis
(P<0.01).  There were no significant correlations between age, gender, route
of transmission, steatosis or alcohol consumption with the extent of
histologic activity or fibrosis.  In conclusion, AST values correlate
well-with two of three features of hepatic inflammation and with the extent of
hepatic fibrosis.  These findings suggest that AST values should be considered
in decisions regarding the need for liver biopsy and treatment in patients
with chronic hepatitis C viral infections."

Hepatitis C (HCV)?."  P.G.  Quinn, D.E.  Wheeler, M.M.  Jamal and A.
Sonnenberg.  Departments of Medicine and Pathology, University of New Mexico

(UNM), Albuquerque, New Mexico.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "Before undergoing interferon therapy for
infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), patients usually undergo a liver
biopsy and multiple serologic tests to rule out other liver diseases.  In 93
HCV patients, the clinical and economic implications of omitting the serologic
tests in HCV were examined.  METHODS:  Over a period of two years, 93
consecutive patients entered the study.  Entry criteria were elevated serum
transaminases (ALT and AST), positive serum test for HCV by ELISA or RIBA, and
a liver biopsy.  Special stains assessed iron overload and alpha-1 antitrypsin
(AI AT) deficiency.  All patients had serum tests for ferritin, iron (Fe),
iron binding capacity (TIBC), A1AT, ceruloplasmin, and/or anti-nuclear
antibodies.  The costs of each test were based on the current UNM fee
schedule.  RESULTS:  None of the patients showed an abnormal test for
ceruloplasmin or A1AT.  Five patients had a ferritin value >800 ng/ml, but
only two patients also had elevated iron saturation (Fe/TIBC >65%).  The two
biopsies, however, did not contain increased iron and so were not consistent
with hemochromatosis (HC).  None of the other liver biopsies showed
histopathologic changes consistent with HC, Wilson's disease, or
MAT-deficiency.  Testing costs were:  Fe/TIBC $39.25, ferritin $61.50,
ceruloplasmin $33.50, and A1AT $30.50.  The expense for these tests totalled
$164.75 per person.  Therefore, $15,321.75 represents the potential savings in
this population of 93 patients.  CONCLUSION:  If a pre-treatment liver biopsy
is deemed necessary to assess liver pathology in an HCV patient, serologic
testing for HC, Wilson's disease and A1AT deficiency seems redundant and not
indicated, since the presence of any of these diagnoses is readily assessed by
liver biopsy with special stains.  The minor downside to this suggested
strategy is the need send fixed tissue for iron quantitation if the iron stain
is suggestive of hemochromatosis."

liver biopsy.  All the subjects were comparable for age (47 yrs, range 32-63)
and sex (F/M:  6/9 and 7/8).  HCV-viremia was assessed on serum and liver
tissue according to the following method.  The most conserved region (5') of
HCV-RNA retrotranscribed and amplified with outer primers and cloned.  To this
product the middle 70 bp of exogenous DNA were added and different dilutions
of this longer product were used for competitive PCR.  Liver tissue HCV-RNA
was significantly correlated to serum HCV-RNA in 'symptomatic' patients
(M:10(6) copies of genome/ml, range 10(3)-10(9) vs.  M:10(5) copies of
genome/ml,range 10(2)-10(8); r=0.627 P<0.01).  No significantly correlation
was rather found in 'Asymptomatic' subjects.  No difference in HCV-RNA tissue
levels was detected between the two groups whereas serum HCV-RNA levels were
significantly different (M:10(2), range 750-10(7) copies of genome/ml vs.
M:10(5), range 10(2)-10(8) copies of genome/ml P<0.01).  Liver histology was
comparable in the two groups and ALT serum levels significantly related to
HCV-Viremia.  CONCLUSIONS:  HCV-viremia does not parallel tissue levels of
HCV-RNA indicating that virus C replication might also be identified in areas
other than liver.  Serum HCV-viremia seems to be the only discriminating value
among different phases of HCV related-CH."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting

3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "BACKGROUND:  Little is known about the viral
genotypes, the levels of viremia and the severity of liver lesions in blood
donors with HCV infection and persistently normal alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels.  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  We analyzed HCV genotype and RNA
titer in 33 volunteer blood donors, 19 with persistently normal and 14 with
raised ALT levels.  Seventeen donors with normal ALT and all donors with
raised ALT underwent liver biopsy and evaluation of the histological activity
index (HAI).  RESULTS:  Genotype 2 was detected in most donors with normal
ALT, whereas genotype 1 was more frequent among donors with raised ALT
(P<0.01).  HCV RNA titer, determined by competitive PCR, was higher in donors
with raised ALT than in those with normal ALT (median 8.2 log copies/ml, range
6.1-8.85, vs median 7.4, range 4.95-8.6, P=0.01).  The scores for portal
inflammation and for fibrosis in the HAI were higher in donors with increased
ALT (P<0.05 and P<0.01).  HCV genotype had no statistical relationship with
RNA titer; or with liver histology.  The score for periportal necrosis was
correlated with the viral titer (P<0.01).  CONCLUSION:  Both the infecting
genotype and the levels of hepatitis C virus replication were independently
associated with the ALT profile.  The severity of portal inflammation and
fibrosis was higher in donors with raised ALT, and the rate of viral
replication was correlated with the degree of periportal necrosis."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "OBJECTIVES:  To evaluate histopathological
alterations in young asymptomatic blood donors positive for hepatitis C virus
(anti-HCV-ELISA II) and the identification of known risk factors.  MATERIAL
AND METHODS:  Asymptomatic blood donors anti-HCV positive (ELISA
II/double-checked), HBsAg and HIV negatives were referred for evaluation.
Thirty-four patients who had any two alterations in the following liver
function tests (LFT):  AST, ALT, total bilirubin, serum proteinogram, GGT,
alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time were selected for percutaneous liver
biopsy and reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for
hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) in serum after ultrasound, platelet count and
KTTP.  RESULTS:  The mean age was 35.7 years, 82.4% were male.  LFT were
minimally abnormal and did not point to chronicity.  The histologic findings
were:  I) HCV Chronic Active Hepatitis - 29.4%; II) HCV-Chronic Persistent
Hepatitis 20.6%; III) Reactional Hepatitis - 17.6%; IV) Alcoholic Residual
Lesion - 5.9%; V) Steatosis - 8.8% and VI) Normal in 17.6%.  HCV-RNA was
detected in 26 patients (76.5%).  In these cases, liver histology and
aminotransferases were abnormal in 13 patients and remained normal in the
other 13.  HCV-RNA was not detected in 8 patients (23.5%).  Among these, 5 had
abnormal liver histology and aminotransferases; two had normal liver histology
with elevated aminotransferases and one case had abnormal liver histology with
normal aminotransferases.  History disclosed the following risk factors:  a)
Percutaneous Exposure (tattoos, non-disposable syringes use) - 65.5%; b) IV
Drug Addiction 58.8%; c) Previous Blood Transfusion - 26.5%; d) Sexual
Promiscuity - 18.5%; e) Homosexual Behavior - 15.2%.  Alcohol abusers or
dependents were 43.3%.  CONCLUSIONS:  1) Liver biopsy disclosed frequent,
occult, HCV chronic hepatitis in this population, regardless of HCV-RNA
positive or negative status; 2) Risk factors were detected in the majority of
these patients."

Gene Targeting (Stem Cells)
"Targeting of the Dopamine D[3] Receptor Gene in Embryonic Stem Cells:
Enrichment for Homologous Recombination by Destabilizing Selection Marker
Transcripts from Random Integration Sites."  B.V.  Skryabin and C.  Schmauss.

Department Psychiatry and Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Mt.  Sinai
School of Medicine, New York, New York.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "Successful gene targeting by homologous recombination is largely
determined by the relative frequency of homologous vs.  nonhomologous
recombination events.  A widely used selection method for homologously
recombinant ES cells is a positive-negative selection (PNS) which typically
involves the placement of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene outside of the
targeted homology and the addition of antiviral drugs to the ES cell-selection
media.  However, the toxicity of such drugs (ganciclovir or FIAU) is thought
to impair the ability of ES cells to colonize the germ line.  An alternative
to the use of antiviral agents in conjunction with G-418 for PNS is to
destabilize only that portion of the neomycin phosphotransferase II mRNA that
derives from random integration sites (positive selection).  We have targeted
the dopamine D3-receptor gene locus in mouse ES cells with 5 different
replacement targeting vectors.  Four vectors contained one of the following
sequence elements that are thought to destabilize the neomycin-resitance-gene
(neor) transcript:  1) a poly (A(+)) less neorcassette; 2) a neor ribozyme
with proven catalytic activity; 3) a mutant ribozyme placed outside of the
targeted homology (control); and 4) an antisense neor sequence.  A control
vector contained the TK gene placed outside of the targeted homology.  Our
initial results indicate that these strategies are effective alternatives to
the selection with antiviral agents.  (Supported by NSF IBN-9409772)."

United Kingdom.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The natural history of chronic HCV is poorly
understood.  We prospectively monitored the histological progression of
chronic HCV infection in untreated asymptomatic patients using serial two
yearly liver biopsies.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Sixty five asymptomatic HCV
RIBA positive blood donors (48 male, 17 female, median age 37 years) referred
from the Blood Transfusion Service were investigated.  Forty had an overt
parenteral risk factor for HCV exposure - 36 IVDU, 4 prior transfusion.  All
were HCV RNA+ve.  Seventeen patients (26%) had normal initial transaminases.
Median ALT was 48iu (range 9-440, normal <30), AST 48iu (range 14-200, normal
30iu).  Liver biopsy was recommended for all patients, and histology was
scored (without reference to clinical details) according to a modified Knodell
histological activity index (HAI, maximum possible score 13).  63 patients had
an initial biopsy:  median HAI=2, mean HAI=2.8, range 08, none cirrhotic.
When HAI>=6 (9 patients), treatment with alpha interferon was recommended.
When HAI<6 (54 patients), interferon was not used but 2 yearly follow-up
biopsies were recommended.  To date, 29 biopsies have been repeated in
untreated patients - 16 deteriorated, 4 improved, 9 unchanged.  In re-biopsied
patients median HAI increased from 2 to 3.  Serum HCV RNA titre was not
related to progression.  The median ALT at 2 years was unchanged in untreated
patients.  CONCLUSIONS:  In asymptomatic RIBA+ve patients initial histological
changes are mild.  In many patients there is a slow histological progression
over 2 years."

Blood Banking (Storage)
Murphy, S.; Shimizu, T.; Miripol, J.  "Platelet Storage for Transfusion in
Synthetic Media:  Further Optimization of Ingredients and Definition of Their
Roles."  Blood, November 15, 1995;86(10):3951-3960.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Blood,
"Currently, most platelet concentrates (PC) are stored for transfusion at 20
degrees C to 24 degrees C in autologous plasma.  There are potential
advantages in replacing some of this plasma with a synthetic medium.  In this
study, our major goals were to define the optimal ingredients and their
concentrations in such a medium and to gain insight into the mechanism by
which each ingredient confers benefit.  In addition, we wished to validate a
new polyvinyl chloride container plasticized with di-n-decyl phthalate (DnDP)
for PC storage.  PC derived from donations of whole blood were stored for 7
days in autologous plasma or a basic synthetic medium (BSM) containing 15
mmol/L glucose, 21 mmol/L citrate, and physiologic concentrations of salts
other than bicarbonate within either the DnDP container or a licensed
polyolefin container, PL-732.  Metabolic events were characterized and a panel
of in vitro tests were used to monitor platelet quality as systematic changes
in the BSM were made.  Platelet quality was at least as good, if not better,
after storage in DnDP in comparison to PL-732.  pH consistently decreased to
less than 6.0 because of inadequate buffering of lactic acid in BSM alone.
However, pH and the in vitro tests were well maintained by either the serial
addition of bicarbonate (BSM + B) or the addition of at least 15 mmol/L
acetate and 10 mmol/L phosphate (BSM + AP).  The benefits of BSM + AP were
traced to a decrease in lactic acid production by 33% and 19% relative to
plasma and BSM + B, respectively, and the vigorous oxidation of acetate (0.66
+/- 0.09 mmol/d/10(12) platelets).  The rates of lactate production and
acetate consumption were similar and the pH during storage correlated with the
difference between the two rates, suggesting that acetate oxidation has an
alkalinizing effect equivalent on a molar basis to the acidifying effect of
production of lactate and a hydrogen ion.  When pyruvate replaced acetate, it
was also metabolized vigorously (0.52 +/- 0.06 mmol/d/10(12) platelets), Its
presence suppressed lactic acid production by 44% relative to BSM + B and
allowed maintenance of pH and platelet quality similar to what is achieved
with acetate.  The results strongly suggest that the benefit from acetate (or
pyruvate) is derived from its oxidation and the use of a hydrogen ion during
that oxidation.  For reasons that are not yet clear, the omission of phosphate
resulted in pH decrease to less than 6.0 in 3 of 9 PC even with acetate
present.  The results allow for a more complete definition of the minimal
essential ingredients of an optimal medium relative to the amount of plasma
carried over into the PC.  With less than 20% plasma carry-over, 15 mmol/L
acetate, 14 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L phosphate, and 5 mmol/L citrate produce
excellent results.  After 7 days of storage in such a medium, the results of
in vitro tests reflecting platelet quality were at least as good as, if not
better than, results after storage in plasma."  The corresponding author for

Hemophilia (HCV)

Alberti, A.  "Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes and Severity of Chronic Liver
Disease in Haemophiliacs."  British Journal of Haematology, November

1995;91(3):708-713.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Haematology, "We studied the activity and stage of chronic liver disease in
45 HCV-seropositive/HIV-seronegative patients with severe haemophilia followed
for at least 10 years, HCV-RNA was detected in serum in 36 patients (80%)
Viraemic cases were further analyzed for HCV genotypes:  10 (28%) were
infected by type 1a, 10 (28%) by type 1b, seven (19%) by type 2, four (11%) by
type 3, four (11%) had mixed infections (one by 1a + 1b, one by 1a + 2, one by
type 2 + 3, and one by 1a + 2 + 3).  ALT levels were within the normal range
in 55% of the HCV-RNA negative patients but in only 11% of the viraemic cases.
Results show a trend for higher levels of ALT in HCV-RNA-positive patients
compared with those without viraemia (98 +/- 56 v 60 +/- 61), and particularly
with patients with type 3 HCV infection (148 +/- 44).  We suggest:  that a
slow progression of chronic liver disease occurs in haemophilic
HCV-positive/HIV-negative patients and conclude that presence of HCV-RNA in
serum correlates well with cytolytic damage but, in the time-scale of our
follow-up period, commonly used clinical-laboratory parameters cannot predict
the chronic evolution of liver infection or identify differences in disease
progression in relation to specific HCV subtypes."  The corresponding author

Replication in Haemophiliacs:  Role of Co-Infection with Human

Immunodeficiency Virus."  British Journal of Haematology, November
1995;91(3):703-707.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Haematology, "In order to evaluate the evolution of transfusional hepatitis
C in haemophiliacs, we performed a retrospective study of ALT levels and HCV
viraemia with a RNA PCR assay in 57 patients.  We found that the vast majority
of HCV-infected patients remained viraemic (43/57= 75%) and higher ALT levels
correlated with HCV viraemia.  Although indicators of the transfusional viral
load (age, severity of haemophilia) and HBV co-infection did not correlate
with HCV RNA replication, HIV seropositivity was strongly associated with
persistence of HCV viraemia (23/25 = 92% in HIV-positive versus 20/32 = 62% in
HIV-negative patients), without any correlation with CD4 counts.  Genotyping
of HCV in the 43 viraemic patients shows more frequent genotype 1 in the
HIV-seropositive group (14/23) than in the seronegative group (6/20).  Our
data emphasize that besides the role of the immunodeficiency status, the
genotypes of HCV might be involved in the differences observed in terms of HCV
RNA replication between the HIV-seropositive and seronegative haemophiliacs."

"Tissue Utilization at the Minnesota Lions' Eye Bank."  Cornea, November
1995;14(6):571-577.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cornea, "The
purpose of this study was to examine the utilization of corneas procured by
the Minnesota Lions' Eye Bank to determine why corneas were excluded from
transplantation and to identify methods to safely increase the number of
tissues made available for transplantation.  We performed a retrospective
review of the eye bank charts of 2,382 corneas evaluated by the Minnesota
Lions' Eye Bank between December 1, 1992 and November 30, 1993.  During that
time 748 corneas (31%) were made available for transplantation; 1,597 (67%)
were directed toward research or training.  Thirty-seven corneas (1.5%) were
disposed of for safety reasons.  Six hundred and sixty of the corneas which
were excluded from transplantation (40%) were excluded for a donor aged over
75 years.  Three hundred and ninety-one corneas (24%) were rejected because of
a contraindication in the donor's past ocular or medical history.  Another 395
corneas (24%) were excluded for poor tissue quality.  The most common reason
for exclusion of tissue based on tissue quality was abnormalities seen on
specular microscopic examination (200 corneas).  Of interest, only 14 corneas
were rejected for low endothelial cell counts.  This review of our tissue
evaluation process has led us to reevaluate and change our policy regarding
exclusion of corneas for epithelial defects and arcus senilis.  These data
suggest that further evaluation of the abnormalities seen on specular
microscopic examination and their validity as exclusion criteria should be
undertaken.  Other areas for further evaluation are how to improve the
timeliness of tissue procurement and whether excluding all tissues over age 75
years and all postsurgical eyes is valid."  The corresponding author for this

Transfusion (Wound Drainage Blood)
Southern, E.P.; Huo, M.H.; Mehta, J.R.; Keggi, K.J.  "Unwashed Wound Drainage
Blood:  What Are We Giving Our Patients?"  Clinical Orthopaedics and Related
Research, November 1995;(320):235-246.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Clinical
Orthopaedics and Related Research, "Wound drainage blood was collected after
total joint arthroplasty was completed in 13 consecutive patients.  Peripheral
blood samples were collected in the recovery room and at 6 hours
postoperatively for all 13 patients.  A standard enzyme-linked immunosorbency
assay was done to quantify tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha,
interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 levels in the samples.  At 6 hours
postoperatively, the levels of cytokines were elevated significantly in the
peripheral and drainage blood serum.  In particular, the drainage blood serum
had the most dramatic increase for all cytokines, which was significant.
Reinfusion of unwashed filtered postoperative wound drainage blood has been
shown not to be entirely benign; pyrogenic transfusion reaction is the most
commonly reported adverse effect, but hemodynamic instability with hypotension
and even myocardial infarction have been reported.  The cause of these adverse
events has not been defined clearly, but may be secondary to the infusion of
cytokines.  The present study showed the presence and significant elevation of
the cytokine levels in the wound drainage blood.  A comprehensive review of
the literature revealed that unwashed drainage blood is a relatively dilute
blood product lacking normal clotting factors and having numerous other
undesirable components that may mitigate against its routine use in lieu of
predeposited autologous or homologous blood.  This is of interest because
there is evidence indicating that wound drainage blood reinfusion may be
unnecessary in total joint arthroplasty when autologous blood is available.
Use of drains in this surgery also may be unnecessary and has been shown to
increase the amount of blood loss and the need for transfusion."  The
