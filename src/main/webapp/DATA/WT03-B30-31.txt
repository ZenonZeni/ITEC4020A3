PENA TO MAKE MAJOR `ITS' STRATEGY ANNOUNCEMENT

     At our deadline, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena was to
make a major intelligent transportation systems (ITS) announcement
regarding ITS deployment strategy and goals at the Transportation
Research Board annual meeting here.
     However, because of blizzard conditions on the East Coast, Pena's
speech was delayed until after our deadline.  Look for full coverage
in the next issue of GLOBAL POSITIONING & NAVIGATION NEWS.
     The ITS industry received a financial boost late last year by
Congress in the form of $223 million in 1996 funding (GPNN, Nov. 30,
1995, p. 1).  Of the $223 million, nearly $110 million in new ITS
funding was set aside by Congress.  Approximately $113 million was
targeted for ITS through the "1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation
Act."
     Last year, there were concerns, because of budget constraints,
that ITS funding would be "zeroed" out by the Republican majority.

ROCKWELL NAMES PATHMASTER MARKETING PARTNERS

     To extinguish persisting rumors that it may not be committing to
vehicle navigation markets, Rockwell Automotive Electronics recently
signed multi-year contracts with Directional Technologies and Entronix
International Inc. for nationwide distribution and service for
Rockwell's GPS-based PathMaster vehicle navigation unit.
     "We feel we have the best vehicle navigation system in the
industry.  Now we believe we have the best distribution and service,"
said Roger Stevens, Rockwell Automotive Electronics general manager. 
The announcement came at the recent trade show that many vehicle
navigation units are now being showcased: the 1996 International
Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
     Troy, Mich.-based Directional Technologies, which is experienced
in aftermarket products for corporate fleet accounts, will begin its
portion of the contract by establishing a nationwide dealer network,
the company said.
     George Derderian, Directional Technologies president, said the
deal with Rockwell gives his company a competitive edge in driver
information systems and traffic telematics.  He also said that
Directional Technologies wanted to enter the wireless integration
product field to include GPS, cellular and wireless data integration.
     In addition, Directional Technologies will provide national
distribution and marketing support that will include commercial and
corporate accounts.
     The company will establish offices in large metropolitan areas to
provide installation, sales, customer service and marketing support
for PathMaster.
Minneapolis-based Entronix International will provide repair and
remanufacture services and establish a nationwide installation network
for PathMaster.
     Entronix plans to distribute PathMaster to new car dealers. 
Distribution initially is planned for the San Francisco Bay area.
     The company will establish a chain of installation, repair and
remanufacturing outlets nationwide, the company said.  Entronix will
use its experience, which includes distribution of car stereos and
related products, for PathMaster's service and installation
activities, the company said.
     Currently, map data bases are available for the PathMaster system
in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando,
San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.  In 1996, Rockwell hopes to expand
the system to Austin, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; Boston; Denver;
Dallas; Houston; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; Phoenix; San Antonio,
Texas; and Seattle.
     The Rockwell-based vehicle navigation system is featured in
Hertz, Avis and National Car Rental vehicles.
     In other CES show news, San Dimas, Calif.-based Magellan Systems
Corp. showed off its $200 GPS 2000 handheld receiver for consumer
markets.  In addition, Magellan displayed its aviation handheld with
cartographic maps and aviator data base.

AVL UNIT SALES CONTINUE RAPID GROWTH WORLDWIDE

     Automatic vehicle location units will continue to achieve growth
in 1996 in both international and domestic markets, many industry
observers believe.
     However, a saturation point may be realized in about five years
as trucking fleets, taxi cab companies and service fleets realize the
benefits of GPS-based fleet management.
     In a contract worth more than $3.3 million, GMSI, Canadian
subsidiary of Montvale, N.J.-based Geotek Communications Inc. and CEI
Technologies sold 4,400 GPS-based units to Comfort Transportation in
Singapore.  The units will go into the nation's largest taxi fleet.
     First deliveries are scheduled for later this month, with the
remaining units to be shipped by June.  With options, the deal could
call for as many as 9,500 more units sold to Comfort Transportation.
     Although its survey and mapping sales continue to see high sales
to lead the company, Trimble Navigation recently sold GPS/AVL systems
to public safety fleets in Aurora, Colo.; Monterrey, Calif.; and a
paratransit agency in San Jose, Calif.  A total of 122 units were sold
to the three companies.

GPS COMPANIES NOT HAPPY WITH SECURITIES LAWSUITS

     Although there are not many publicly traded GPS companies,
several are defending themselves against securities lawsuits that are
plaguing high-technology firms.  Dallas-based HighwayMaster
Communications Inc. recently was named in a securities class-action
lawsuit in a Texas federal court.
     The lawsuit alleges that the company's registration statement,
prospectus and other information contained in its June 1995 initial
public offering (IPO) contained "false and misleading" statements.
     The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, named the company,
its board of directors and lead underwriters from the IPO.  An
attorney for HighwayMaster declined to be interviewed.
     Another company also fed up with the plethora of lawsuits is 
Trimble Navigation Ltd., which has seen its stock go from about $8 to
more than $30, then drop to less than $20.
     Trimble recently was named in a securities class-action lawsuit
that was aimed at companies that experience a wide swing in stock
value.  The same San Diego-based law firm that is suing HighwayMaster
is suing Trimble and other companies.
     "I cannot understand the justification for permitting the
prosecution of these [lawsuits], primarily benefitting lawyers under
the guise of protecting shareholders.  A clever niche market [has]
been discovered to drain the energy out of the entrepreneurial
process," said Trimble President and CEO Charles Trimble.
     He said that the lawsuits will hurt high-technology companies'
ability to compete in international markets.
     Trimble also said it only takes one disgruntled shareholder to
extract millions of dollars from companies.  The cost is then passed
back to the shareholder in terms of insurance premiums, he said.

BATTELLE USING SIEMENS ROUTE GUIDANCE SYSTEM

     As part of a $14 million Federal Highway Administration project,
Battelle's Transportation Division is using an in-vehicle device
manufactured by Siemens for a Traveler Information Showcase in Atlanta
this summer.
     The Siemens in-vehicle device uses FM subcarrier transmissions
for route guidance, electronic yellow pages and traffic updates.
     The Siemens unit does not use GPS, although some companies such
as Cupertino, Calif.-based Differential Corrections, John E. Chance
and Associates and Cue Network Corp. offer differential GPS services
through FM subcarrier transmissions.
     Scientific-Atlanta, while not an ITS Showcase team member, is
using a GPS-based system in testing during the 1996 Olympics.
     Other technologies used in the Showcase include wireless data
transmission, cable television, the Internet and interactive
television technology.
     Although the users of the Showcase will be able to avoid
accidents through information provide, they will not be able to use
their devices to report incidents.
     The Showcase's map data bases are provided by Navigation
Technologies and Etak Inc.
     Other devices used in the Showcase will include handheld devices
from Hewlett-Packard and Motorola.  HP's entry will be the HP200LX
Palmtop and Motorola will test its Envoy system.
     Contrary to previous published reports, the Showcase and the 1996
Olympics, while running concurrently, are not affiliated with each
other.

INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES GIVE INSIGHT ON 1995 AND 1996

     If the positioning and navigation industry had to label 1995, it
could have been "1995: The Year Wireless Integration Spurred Industry
Growth."
     More and more GPS companies and software vendors looked to
partner with the big cellular, personal communication services, land
mobile radio and mobile satellite players to gain a foothold in
lucrative consumer markets.        
     The market segment that always has been growing has been survey
and mapping, with three to four companies always at the top of the
heap in sales.      One company even had a top-drawing survey show
that solidified its lead in that market.  However, even that company
has been making inroads into other areas such as automatic vehicle
location, vehicle navigation and even for the sparse defense
contracts.  Other companies have been dominant in defense market
realms, original equipment manufacturer products and consumer GPS.
     In 1991, the GPS industry was looked upon as a defense offshoot. 
Companies looked for growth as the constellation was developed by the
U.S. Air Force.
     Some concentrated in handheld receiver markets, others left after
a year or two because consumer interest was low.  Now, as the
constellation and industry mature, companies are finding more ways to
integrate GPS and other technology for consumer market entry.
     As we begin 1996, several GPS industry executives took the time
to reflect on the status of the industry and how their companies fared
in 1995.  Each company has found its niche in a particular navigation
and positioning market--and now are looking to expand into other areas
in 1996.  
     Here's what the executives had to say:

Charles Trimble
President and CEO, Trimble Navigation:
     "1995 has been another great year for the industry.  [Geographic
information systems] and tracking have been really strong and we are
also seeing the emergency of a strong avionics market.  
     "For 1996, land survey should experience continued growth in unit
volume, although the average selling price is dropping.  Car
navigation opportunities will continue to expand with unit volumes
anticipated to double again."

Robert Denaro
Director, Motorola Positioning and Navigation Systems Business:
     "I think our strategy includes [going after] the biggest volume
market opportunities, not niche markets.  In our core GPS business, we
are starting to see volume increases in automatic vehicle location and
timing markets.     "Simultaneously, we are seeing technology advances
in GPS that are bringing the cost down.  So the prospects for 1996
look very good.  A lot of press attention went to autonomous
navigation markets, but the late bloomer is wireless integration [of
GPS].
     "The great thing about wireless integration is that it will
enable a lot of people to get involved in GPS--to add value to
[existing products], and fuel the growth of the industry.  In the
past, it was one thing for a company to sell a handheld GPS to a
hiker.  Now, with wireless integrator, that's a huge enabler. Ford is
seeing a tremendous response to the Motorola Rescu system--and we are
hearing from people in the industry who are replicating [wireless
integration efforts]."

Chuck Boesenberg
President, Ashtech Inc.:
     "1995 has been an evolutionary year for Ashtech.  Late in 1994,
majority control of the company was assumed by Patricof and Co.
Ventures Inc., a New York-based venture capital firm.  Bill Bottoms
was named chairman of the board and I was named president and CEO.
     "We added two new board members, Rocky Pimentel of LSI Logic and
Chet Silvestri of Sun Microsystems.  We reorganized the executive
staff to include Todd Townsend as vice president of product
development, Sergei Gourevitch as chief scientist and Len Kruczynski
as director of strategic relationships.
     "We acquired Springhill Engineering, a company which develops and
markets precision farming equipment using GPS technology.  Ashtech
also entered into significant strategic partnerships in 1995.  In
addition to our ongoing relationship with Topcon, we added Philips
Semiconductor, Geotronics AB, and 
Sokkia Corp. 
     "These partnerships have expanded our area of expertise and
marketshare. Additionally, because Ashtech values the dedication
demonstrated by its employees we have added programs internally to
reward that dedication.
     "We feel the key to GPS realizing its full potential will be
adding applications that provide value for all people.  To this end,
we will continue to acquire companies, enter new vertical markets and
create strategic relationships.  Ashtech will continue to explore and
enter partnerships and develop products that will allow us to pursue
and achieve excellence in precision positioning."

W.H. Pomije
Director of Guidance and Navigation
Rockwell International's Collins Avionics & Communications Division:   
 
     "In 1995, Rockwell's Collins Avionics & Communications Division,
as the largest supplier of full military accuracy GPS receiver systems
to the [Defense Department], witnessed several major events.  One was
a ceremony marking the delivery of the 50,000th PLGR (Precision
Lightweight GPS Receiver) to the DoD.  The honored guest and recipient
was Lt. Gen. Otto Guenther, director of Information Systems for
Command, Control, Communications and Computers.
     "Another important milestone was the selection of Collins
embedded GPS by McDonnell Douglas for the Joint Direct Attack Munition
(JDAM).  Major implications in the growth of GPS technology have
permitted Collins receivers to a) decrease in cost, b) improve in
performance and capability, and c) the growth in the number of
applications, including the PLGR+Gun Laying System to swiftly survey
in mortars, artillery and mechanized howitzers, PLGR+ 96 receiver with
major enhancements, VPLGR+96 (Vehicular Precision Lightweight GPS
Receiver), development of miniature PLGR P-code engines, and
deployment of the lightweight, wearable plug-and-play Y-code Hunter
receiver.  Several countries, including Denmark, Norway, New Zealand,
and Germany, have chosen the PLGR as the standard GPS for their
armies.
     "For 1996, Collins Avionics & Communications Division foresees
more of the same, with further price decreases, continued performance
enhancements, and a steady growth in applications.  At least a half
dozen new surface mobility GPS receiver systems will be introduced
during 1996, aimed directly at helping digitize the battlefield.  And
more countries will join the those where PLGR receivers already are in
daily use by armed forces and approved government agencies.
     "[In addition to our defense products,] our GPS/geographic
information system-based precision farming product, VISION SYSTEM, is
expected to have a major impact in the agricultural marketplace in
terms of cost savings and reducing environmental issues associated
with farming.  VISION SYSTEM is a highly integrated crop management,
analysis and reporting product."

BRIEFS

     In the joining of two large GPS players, Lockheed Martin Corp.
and Loral Corp. agreed this week to merge their defense electronics
and system integration businesses.  Lockheed Martin will buy Loral's
defense electronics and system integration businesses for $9.1
billion--including $2.1 billion of assumed debt.  Nearly $7 billion
will be paid to Loral shareholders.  Lockheed Martin also will invest
$344 million for a 20 percent stake in Loral Space, which will allow
that business to operate with $700 million--with no debt--at a price
of $7.50 per share, the company said.  (Chip Manor, Lockheed Martin,
301/897-6258.)

     Rockwell International Corp. won a $10.3 million contract for
launch and orbital operations, repair and sustaining support for the
GPS Block II/IIA satellite program.  The U.S. Air Force's Space and
Missile Systems Center at Los Angeles Air Force Base is the
contracting agency.  (Eileen Algaze, Rockwell International, 714/833-
4600.)

     Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Smiths Industries Aerospace and Alaska
Airlines recently completed the first operational flights using
required navigation performance/actual navigation performance in
Alaska.  The flights tested a flight management computer system with

compatible with GPS and Loran receivers.  "We are selling the product
through marine dealers and direct from Nobeltec," said John Grady,
Nobeltec's director of marketing.  "The interest in Navtrek has been
very good, and sales are looking very promising."  (Jay Phillips,
Nobeltec, 206/391-9131.)

     Ashtech Inc. named Len Kruczynski director of strategic
relationships.  Kruczynski will manage new company partnerships. 
Kruczynski previously worked for Trimble Navigation, where he worked
in the military systems and surveying and mapping divisions.  (Sally
Kenvin, Ashtech, 408/524-1460.)

     Woods Hole, Mass.-based Navionics Inc.'s new Nav-Chart memory
cards feature 150-chart storage capability.  The Nav-Chart format
gives GPS/plotter manufacturers an another option for thin LCD units
that require flush mounting and small handheld units without space to
accommodate larger memory cards, the company said.  The new chart
cartridges are being used in GPS plotting devices from Micrologic and
Northstar.  (Lisa Thomas, Navionics, 508/457-0701, ext. 12.)

     Salem, Ore.-based II Morrow Inc. will give owners of any GPS

THE TOP INDUSTRY STORIES OF 1995

     During 1995, several positioning and navigation companies emerged
to lead the industry in surveying, vehicle navigation sales, military,
marine and other survey markets.  The editors of GLOBAL POSITIONING &
NAVIGATION NEWS recently compiled a list of the year's top news
events.

1.   WAAS Contract Awarded Amid Controversy 
     The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded a $475 million
contract to Wilcox Electric Co. for the nationwide wide-area
augmentation system (WAAS).  The General Accounting Office is
questioning how the FAA and Wilcox can meet its 1999 implementation
deadline.

2.   Wireless Integration Spurs GPS Industry
     Many GPS companies integrated GPS receivers into consumer
products such as cellular phones, mobile satellite units, land mobile
radio and wireless data to spur consumer sales.

3.   DOD Declares GPS Constellation With FOC
     In a long-awaited, but largely ceremonial event, the Defense
Department declared the GPS constellation with full operational
capability last summer. 

4.   NAPA Study Calls For Phase Out of SA
     The National Academy of Public Administration's report on GPS
called for the Defense Department to scrap Selective Availability--
much to DoD's dismay.

5.   Loral Federal Systems Grabs $400 Million Ground Contract
     Continuing its management of the GPS ground segment until the
Block IIF contract takes effect, Gaithersburg, Md.-based Loral Federal
Systems won one the largest contracts of the year from the Defense
Department.

6.   Trimble Sees Stock Go on Roller Coaster Ride
     Trimble Navigation saw its stock price soar to $35 per share from
around $8 per share in mid-1994.  Then the stock plunged to less than
$20 per share.  It was an investor's dream--and headache--in 1995.

7.   Block IIF Acquisition Contract News
     Formal request for proposals for a $3 billion to $3.6 billion
Block IIF constellation were issued by the DoD.  When awarded, one
prime contractor will be responsible for designing and manufacturing
33 GPS birds among other tasks.

1996 VEHICLE NAVIGATION SALES TO ACHIEVE MODERATE GROWTH

     The new year may allow vehicle navigation manufacturers and
integrators to realize some profits, but it remains to be seen whether
1996 will be the breakthrough year for the industry.  Manufacturers
will continue to gain publicity for new systems and consumer education
and awareness to vehicle navigation systems' benefits. 
     At the recent 1996 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) in Las Vegas, GPS-based vehicle navigation products were
showcased in front of an estimated 100,000 attendees.  Companies
participating in an ITS America pavilion included Etak Inc.,
Navigation Technologies, Rockwell Automotive Electronics, Siemens ITS
North America, Sony Corp. and Delco Electronics Corp.
     Other vendors at CES, such as Sanyo Fisher Corp. and Clarion
Sales Corp., 
displayed vehicle navigation units for consumer awareness--not
necessarily to showcase for future U.S. sales.
     However, the consumer electronics manufacturers seem to be
coupling the navigation systems with entertainment systems with
several features.  The current train of thought for marketing managers
is to integrate vehicle navigation capability into radios, CD players
and other entertainment electronics to spur the industry. 
     Sanyo's unit at CES, its new NV-P1, is the first portable
navigation system with a built-in GPS antenna, color LCD monitor with
a TV tuner, CD-ROM and a CD player.  NV-P1 can locate the best travel
a route for a consumer and features Etak digitized maps, the company
said.  The NV-P1 has Naviken format navigation map software.
     The unit is selling in Japan for nearly $1,500, but there is no
scheduled date for its introduction to the U.S. market, Sanyo said. 
Sources said that only time will tell if vehicle navigation markets
will do half as well in the United States as those in Japan. 
Currently, more than 500,000 vehicle navigation units are being sold
in Japan for a variety of reasons.
     The unit constitutes the first U.S. unit to have a video port so
drivers can view videos and even TV while driving with a built-in TV
antenna.  A number of states have loosen laws that preclude a
television screen in a vehicle.  However, it may take a few years
before drivers may watch TV in vehicles--even if the LCD screen also
serves as a vehicle navigation screen.
     The unit can be taken out of a vehicle for portable use--a
feature that may be important in the U.S. market.
     Clarion also is integrated navigation systems with car multimedia
products.  In addition to a VRN1100 voice navigation system, the
company offers a in-dash, hands-free cellular telephone, CD player,
cassette player and TV monitor.    The VRN1100, which costs about
$650, does not use GPS as its navigation engine.  It uses a voice-
activated system that uses a car's wheel bearings for control.
     To activate the system, a person say "navigator," and the system
spells out the starting point and destination, which can be a 
street address, cross streets or landmark such as an airport.  If more
than one location exists, the VRN1100 tells the user what the better
route would be, the company said. 
     The VRN1100 maps cover Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Detroit;
Chicago; Indianapolis; New York/New Jersey; Northern and Southern
California; and Las Vegas.
     Clarion said the company may introduce GPS-based units in the
United States, but that move depends on market acceptance of similar
units made by other companies.  In Japan, the company's vehicle
navigation units equipped with GPS, like competitor's versions, have
been a huge success.  Trying to replicate that success in the U.S. may
take two to three more years, sources said.  

  ...Trimble-Delco Sign Vehicle Navigation Deal 

     To grab part of a vehicle navigation market it expects to grow to
more than $3 billion by the end of the century, Trimble Navigation and
Delco recently signed a memorandum of understanding to develop
consumer automobile GPS products.
     Although Delco has been using Trimble GPS board in its Telepath
100 series vehicle navigation units, the memorandum makes Trimble its
exclusive provider of GPS receivers.  Last year, Delco dropped
Rockwell as its GPS vendor.
     Trimble, always considered a market leader in the survey and
mapping, has acknowledged that vehicle navigation constitutes the
company's largest growth opportunity.  
     At CES, Delco and Chatsworth, Calif.-based ORA Electronics
displayed a Telepath 100 unit to provide vehicle navigation and hands-
free cellular interface capability.  Gershon Cooper, ORA's president
said the cars of the future "are going to be like giant computers with
wheels."
     The ORA cellular system, called Telecar, is compatible with most
cellular phones and is designed to integrate into most Delco radios. 
The company is marketing the system at Circuit City and Tandy's
Incredible Universe.  The company plans to ship the units in 1996's
first four months.
     In addition to cellular capability, Delco is enhancing its
Telepath 100 with its EyeCue head-up display.  EyeCue projects an
image of navigational information on a vehicle's windshield to allow
users to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel,
Delco said.
     Delco's Telepath 200 series include GPS, the cellular system and
an AM/FM entertainment system.  Both the Telepath 100 and Telepath 200
systems have a PCMCIA memory card that features a single display
indicating a user's navigational menu choices and directional buttons. 
The distance to a user's destination also is displayed.    
     Overall, vehicle navigation companies are relying on early rental
car consumer acceptance of the vehicle navigation units to boost the
industry's market.  Avis Inc.'s Satellite Guidance vehicle navigation
units will be available at Denver International Airport, the company
said.  The Rockwell-built unit currently is available in California;
Florida; Nevada; Georgia; New York; Washington, D.C.; and in the
Midwest in Chicago; Detroit; and Indianapolis.
     A large advertising campaign for the units has boosted brand name
recognition not only for vehicle navigation, but for GPS, because many
consumers still do not know how the system works.
