The Dow Jones World Index is still in a solid uptrend, but the Morgan Stanley EAFE looks to be in a minor correction. <b>On balance, this should not trigger any portfolio changes.<p></b><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/e.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>UROPE. The Morgan Stanley Europe Index is in a minor correction, probably explaining the weakness in the broader-based EAFE. The Europe Index is at 755.00. If we break below about 740, then the trend may be turning negative. At present, we can wait.<p>The European markets seem quiet for the past two weeks, reducing me to report the following information.<p>Britain announced that it will probably dispose of up to 750,000 Mad Cow infected carcasses by incinerating parts of them in British power stations. Without doubt, this Summer, Britain should smell like the world's biggest barbecue.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/a.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>SIA. The Japanese markets have yet to make a <i>clear</i> breakout above the long term price ceiling at about 21,500 to 22,500 on the Nikkei. I will continue to wait for 22,800 as the buy point. There is only one reason for that ceiling. Japanese institutions are unloading their shares. If we clear that level then they have finished selling and there is plenty of profit ahead. I am a lot less sanguine about having the Yen work in our favour. The rally in the Yen that I described last month petered out as the US Dollar gained strength against most foreign currencies. That will dampen profitability of your mutual fund after conversion to Canadian dollars<p>Over the past weekend, the Japanese banks reported (bad) loan losses worth US$47 Billion. This was their biggest loss in 50 years. Sumitomo Trust Bank reported a loss so big that it surpassed the last five years' profits! Fortunately for the banks, there have been good securities markets and low interest rates to reduce the financial pressure. Without these bad loans from the late 80's, the banks would have had excellent profits. Even so, only four of eleven banks managed to show profit for the past year. Estimates of the remaining bad debts seem to indicate that just under half of all the banks bad debts are still outstanding.<p>The Hong Kong markets are struggling to rally. My target remains at the previous all time high of 12,500 on the Hang Seng<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/l.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>ATIN AMERICA. Over the past month, Latin funds have been the strongest international sector. <b>Maybe it's time that I stopped worrying about the Peso and recommended this particular group</b>. Here are the three top Latin funds by one year performance:<i> GT. Latin America (26.4%); Scotia Excell Latin America (25.5%); Fidelity Latin American Growth (18.9%)<p></i>On the lighter side, Mexican music stations have had a field day with a song poking fun at ex-president Carlos Salinas as the master of a failed circus. His jailed brother Raul stars as a magician whose best trick is to make money disappear. Raul is in jail for embezzling millions of dollars of government funds while Carlos ran the country. It is unusual for Mexicans to be so disrespectful of a former leader. The depth of Mexican's anger with the Salinas brothers (Carlos was blamed for engineering the Peso Crisis in December 1994) is so great that a small industry has been created around the manufacture of unflattering dolls of the two brothers. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/europe.gif">Europe<p></a><a href="charts/eafe.gif">E.
