PAPER CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE
Users Disseminate, Then Print--Increasing Paper Use 

     Imaging is failing to produce the promised paperless office,
experts tell us.  Indeed, expanded use of information technologies,
such as imaging, combined with people's historic reliance on paper are
producing new mountains of documents to file.  "The misapplication of
imaging technology has fueled the use of paper," says Kerry Stackpole,
president of The Association for Work Process Improvement (TAWPI) of
Boston, Mass.  
     Information is easier to access electronically than ever before,
which makes it an easy target to print out constantly.  For instance,
by the year 2004, the pile of information available at the desktop
will come first in electronic form, compared to a 90 percent paper-
domination today, predicts Keith Davidson, executive director for
Xplor International, a Torrance, Calif.-based imaging educational
group.    
     There even is a laser printer paper shortage, according to
Davidson.  He predicts paper use will continue to grow at a rate of 10
percent annually.   
     Why does paper continue to proliferate, and what can you do about
it?  Electronic dissemination has confused users about how to best use
an imaging system.  The screens available on today's personal computer
(PC) monitors still make it hard to read a document.  Paper continues
to possess a very strong historical significance--both human and
legal.  Vendors suggest the following solutions:
     * View documents on screen only;
     * Print-on-demand;
     * Restrict paper use;
     * Use flat panel monitors; and
     * Employ in-bound faxes.

Electronic Dissemination Proliferates Paper

     Imaging systems were designed to reduce or eliminate paper use
across the enterprise--often by integrating images with an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system.  Documents were supposed to become a
digital representation of the paper version and move across the
enterprise easily, electronically.
     However, instead of using these systems to reduce the amount of
paper in the organization, users are continuing to print documents--
just at another stage in the process.  Where an imaging system could
provide essential workflow of images, users instead refuse to employ
this functionality of an imaging system, or use it "incorrectly," says
Stackpole.  
     The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) also have made it much
easier to obtain information from universities, laboratories and
corporations around the world.
     "The new accessibility of documents, searching methods and
[electronic] filing systems are more efficient," says A.J. Rogers,
vice president of marketing for Wilsonville, Ore.-based Tektroniks, a
color printer manufacturer.   The point in the process where the
document becomes paper has shifted, says Richard Norton, analyst for
Norwell, Mass.-based BIS Strategic Decisions.  For example, instead of
printing the information and distributing it to real estate field
offices, the main office now is sending client information through E-
mail. However, when it arrives at the remote site, agents often print
out copies for themselves, the client and the office's files rather
than rely on the electronic imaging system to manage the document for
them.     
     "Rather than print at the source and distribute through mail or
fax, now information is disseminated digitally and printed at remote
locations," says Susan Hayes, manager of U.S. printer research, with
International Data Corp., a computer research firm in Framingham,
Mass.

Still Not Easy To View Images

    Another reason paper continues to proliferate is the poor quality
of computer screens.  
     While there are a few high-end monitors with very clear screens
available from vendors like San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone and
Ricoh Corp., also of San Jose, for the most part, it still is
difficult to read an image directly from a PC screen.  
     "[Screens] are still not the best way to view a document," says
Norton.  He said that most high-end computer monitors are expensive
and that their deployment in the enterprise tends to be low among
budget priorities.
    Wayne Buchar, platform business team manager for scanners with El
Segundo, Calif.-based Xerox, has been involved in the printing
business for 20 years.  He thinks paper use can be reduced, but that
it will take a much better, portable screen, easily visible in
sunlight to make it happen.  
    Xerox believes enough in the advancement of just such a screen
that its Palo Alto Research Center has been developing a prototype
computer screen based on flat panel technology.  This screen would
replace the typical glass screen monitor, says Buchar.  The new
display technology will have a 6.3-million pixel display, comparable
to a 600 dots-per-inch laser printed page, says Lois Wong, spokeswoman
for Xerox.  

Paper's History Makes it Popular

     There remains quite an historical attachment to paper, in part
for its tactile nature and its continuing utility to the U.S. legal
system, say the experts.  
    In fact, it is the older generation that often is unwilling to
adapt to an electronic imaging environment.  "It depends on the age of
the person whether [that person] will work on the document on the
screen or print it out," says Hayes.  "The need to have it in writing
is the law of the land," added Davidson. But, "imaging use is growing
within the courts," says Lynn Walker, analyst for the National Center
for State Courts, in Williamsburg, Va.  A few states have begun
allowing digital images in the courtroom, such as California and
Texas. 
    In fact, images are being used instead of paper in the courtroom
when tracking such information as witness lists and depositions, she
says.

Reducing Paper Still is Possible

    The worldwide installed printer base in 1995 equaled $22.7
billion, for a total of slightly less than 33 million printers,
including laser, ink jet and impact printers--such as dot matrix and
line character printers, says Hayes.  Laser printers made up $12.5
billion of that total, with ink jet printer sales $6.25 billion in
1995.  
    Davidson predicts that business executives may even restrict the
use of printing, including the number of interoffice mail messages.  
    Routine documents will shrink over the next 10 years as companies
begin to parallel the government's push to reduce paper use across
federal agencies, he adds.
    "We will continue to see fewer and fewer routine documents [on
paper], including interoffice memos," he said.  Davidson predicts the
last interoffice memo will say something like--"no more interoffice
memos."
    In the future, managers may restrict access to documents on local
area networks (LAN) unless they are viewed electronically.  
    "I wouldn't be surprised if people don't run reports that [the
user] can't print until after [the document] has been looked at,"
Davidson says.  
    In addition, print-on-demand is helping to reduce paper
consumption by encouraging users to print only what they need.  
    Also, in-bound fax has become more popular, with such companies
as San Diego-based Mitek Systems Inc. providing software that routes
in-bound faxes directly to the LAN.  
    "This may not do much to keep the paper off the [sender's] desk,
but it will help the [recipient]," says Stackpole. (Richard Norton,

Ways To Reduce Paper In An Imaging Enterprise

*  Determine ways components of your business can be reduced or
       eliminated.
*  Examine process relative to customers' needs--whether or not
       they are comfortable with or without paper.
*  Don't produce paper in the first place--view documents
       electronically.
*  Use modest solutions--they are available.
*  Look to long term success of imaging, not just short term.

WIRELESS MARKET EXPANDS ACCESS FOR E-MAIL USERS

    Companies moved closer to 100-percent wireless coverage for their
mobile E-mail users with the release recently of new services from San
Mateo, Calif.-based RadioMail Corp. and strategic announcements by
ARDIS and RAM Mobile Data.
    RadioMail is offering mobile E-mail users wireless access to
their "home" systems and the Internet.  The company's RadioMail
Message Center Services is being offered over ARDIS, RAM Mobile Data
and cellular digital packet data (CDPD) networks.  The company also
introduced RadioMail Remote Control, which adds dial-up access,
cellular access and message management to the Message Center Services.
    Woodbridge, N.J.-based RAM is teaming with Megahertz Corp., the
Mobile Communications Division of U.S. Robotics, to make available a
new wireless, Type II PC Card.  The AllPoints Wireless PC Card is
designed to operate on RAM's Mobitex-based wireless data
communications service.
    Meanwhile, ARDIS, of Lincolnshire, Ill., is providing wireless
data communications for Apple Computer Inc.'s MessagePad 120 using the
Newton 2.0 operating system.

Cellular and Paging

    Cellular carriers can contract with RadioMail's Message Center
Services to add two-way wireless messaging services to their current
cellular and paging operations.  The two-way messaging services are
compatible with circuit-switched cellular and cellular digital packet
data (CDPD) networks.  The services support numerous applications,
including Internet-compatible E-mail, faxing, pager notification of
new messages and many message management choices to control wireless
communications costs and delivery.
     Mark Elderkin, director of marketing for RadioMail, said that the
company is using "products that people are familiar with already, such
as cellular phones and pagers." 
    RadioMail also introduced RadioMail Remote Control, which adds
dial-up access, cellular access and message management to the
RadioMail wireless messaging services offered over numerous networks,
including ARDIS and RAM.

Personal RadioMailBox

    Remote Control provides individuals with a personal RadioMailBox
and a mobile Internet address that can be linked to their pagers or
through their cellular phones or wireless modems, to their portable
computers.  Users can exchange wireless messages with anybody who has
an Internet E-mail mailbox and send faxes, send messages to pagers,
and monitor news reports and customized stock portfolios, said
Elderkin.
    The Remote Control service has a base price of $9.95 per month,
with connect time charges of 20 cents per minute.
    With E-mail, the company's "thrust will be increasing the amount
of control users have on messages," he said.  Remote allows users to
store and forward certain large messages into their home mailboxes to
be read at another time, Elderkin said, saving air time.
    ARDIS also announced new Mobile Office rate structures last month
for E-mail applications for mobile professionals that start today at
$19.95 per month.  Applications supported in the Mobile Office program
are messaging and E-mail solutions for local area networks, including
ARDIS PersonalMessaging and AirMobile Wireless for Lotus cc:Mail from
Motorola Inc. and Mail-on-the-Run from Greenwich, Conn.-based River
Run Software Group.
    Dan Croft, senior vice president of marketing operations at
ARDIS, said that the combination of hardware, software and air-time
pricing will benefit individuals who want to take advantage of ARDIS
to "access their E-mail and to send and receive messages on their
laptops and wireless communications from virtually any location."
    Apple MessagePad users also can use the ARDIS network to send
wirelessly and receive electronic mail, send faxes and access
applications and information, enabling mobile computing. 
    Newton personal digital assistants, developed by Apple and
Motorola, now may be equipped with ARDIS communications software for
the Newton 2.0 operating system.  Used with Motorola's Personal
Messenger 100D PCMCIA wireless modem card, the ARDIS network provides
MessagePad users nationwide with automatic roaming, enabling them to
manage business from remote locations.
    Software developers creating wireless applications for the
MessagePad can take advantage of ARDIS' Wireless Software Developer
Program.    

RAM Focus

    RAM is focusing its resources on five areas:  field service,
sales, transportation and financial and utility markets.  RAM
currently offers 92 percent service coverage in U.S. cities and is
planning to raise its coverage soon to 100 percent through these five
areas.
    RAM's and Megahertz's AllPoints Wireless PC Card combines the
Type II format with RAM's Mobitex-based service.  
    The PC Card contains a two-watt, built-in radio, giving users
nationwide wireless coverage.
    Janet Boudris, senior vice president of strategic marketing for
RAM Mobile Data, said that the card "will have particular appeal for
sales and field management organizations that are already experiencing
the business benefits of using laptop and palmtop computers to conduct
business." 
    Boudris said that these organizations are "already a step ahead
of their competition.  Moving into the wireless environment is the
next logical step for visionary companies who desire a competitive
edge."
    The AllPoints Wireless PC Card "leverages the strength of RAM
service, delivers superior coverage and battery life and utilizes the
versatility of the Type II Format, said Steve Smith, senior vice
president of marketing for Megahertz.  The "card delivers on all these
goals, giving users a practical solution component they can use
immediately."
    The Type II PC Card is about the size of credit card and slides
into the side of the PC.  Its size--old modems were the size of a
brick--and the fact that it's Mobitex protocol, make the card
advantageous for mobile users, said a spokesman for RAM.  "The size is
a killer," he said.
    The battery saver protocol shuts down the modem automatically
when there is no traffic.  The battery lasts an average of 30 hours,
the spokesman said.  (RadioMail Corp., 800/597-6245; ARDIS, 617/252-

TIPS FOR SELECTING A WORKFLOW TOOL

    Develop criteria for evaluating workflow software before you
start looking for a product, says Bruce Silver, principal at Bruce
Silver Associates in Weston, Mass. 
    "Shopping for workflow is not easy," Silver said recently at the
Bank Administration Institute (BAI) image show.  "The basic problem is
that all of the workflow vendors are trying to solve the same problem: 
managing, organizing and automating a business process.  [All of the
vendors] give different names to the same concepts, [offer] unique
[product] architectures and tend to baffle, rather than inform, the
buyer."
    In addition, it's difficult for end users to compare the
functionality of various workflow tools, Silver said.  Some workflow
products have a lot of functionality built-in while other products
offer a "thin layer" of software and a lot of consulting and
application development services, he noted.
    Another problem when shopping for workflow software is that many
products are less than a year old with few reference sites. Products
can be demonstrated, Silver said, but "many are too new to have a
track record." 

Keep the `Human Factor' in Mind

    The first thing end users should consider when shopping for
workflow software is the "human factor," Silver suggested.  "Before
you start looking at the data sheets or the technical factors, you
need to look at your own organization and your users and developers,"
he explained.  
    Silver recommended that workflow customers keep in mind the
skills of their system operators when evaluating a product.  For
instance, if the system will be used largely by clerical workers, look
for software that is "built for speed" and has tight controls on how
work is presented to users, he suggested.  Choose products with "free-
form" environments for managers and professionals.
    Tip:  Decide whether you will use system integrators, in-house
technicians, or ad hoc tools built into the software to design and
update workflow applications.  "Each of these different types of
developers is the target audience of different workflow products,"
Silver said.
    End users also need to consider the track record of workflow
vendors.  Silver recommended users evaluate vendors based on their
market standing, company history, financial backing and experience in
the workflow market.   
    Silver noted that the best way to measure a vendor's success with
workflow is through its reference sites.  Have vendors provide you
with a list of reference sites in your industry, a breakdown of how
their products are working at each site and a contact at each site. 
Be sure to ask reference customers whether you should contract with
the vendor or a reseller for on-going support. 
    Tip:  Look for products that are supported by several third-
parties, such as consultants or resellers, who offer features that
"snap" into the vendor's framework.  "Besides [offering more
functionality], this implies the vendor may be a market leader because
it is attracting third-party support," Silver said.

Don't Be Confused by Scalability Claims

    Silver warns end users not to be confused by vendors claiming
that their workflow software is scalable.  "Every vendor will say [its
software is] enterprise-scalable," he said.  "It's a meaningless
buzzword at that level."
    Silver recommended customers look at how many concurrent users
each vendor has installed.  "Few workflow vendors can point to
customers with 1,000 seats, all doing workflow in a high-volume
transaction-processing mode," he noted.
    Also, ask vendors whether they plan to offer software that can
support multiple servers.  "The next frontier in workflow is
distributing the workflow server to support remote users in branch
offices, using dial-up lines," Silver predicted.  (Bruce Silver, Bruce
Silver Associates, 617/237-6879.) 

Features To Evaluate When Shopping for Workflow Software

* Graphical workflow maps.  
    Every workflow tool has a graphical map, a visual representation
of the workflow that helps users make changes in the process.
    Silver recommended users look for graphical maps that clearly
represent the workflow.  For example, the maps in some workflow
products have icons that users can click on to see every possible
routing path that can come out of a step.  Other maps have icons that
can be dragged and dropped to alter the workflow.

*User interfaces.  
    Look for products that provide the same interface for all of your
workflow applications if you want to build applications quickly and
easily, Silver suggested.  These interfaces generally feature point
and click tools that allow users to rearrange image windows, list
boxes, status bars, in-boxes and action buttons with relatively little
programming, he added.
    On the other hand, look for products that "hide" workflow
applications if you want to keep the interfaces for your legacy
applications, Silver said.  
The downside:  These products require extra time and money for
programming.

*Deadlines.  
    Users should ask vendors whether their product includes a program
that is triggered if the deadline expires for completing a task or
beginning an item, Silver said.  Some programs move work to another
queue.

*In-baskets.  
    "In a clerical application, you might want the workflow software
to shove the next piece of work to the processing clerk, no questions
asked," Silver said.  "But in other applications you might want to
present an in-basket, which is a list of items [the operator] can work
on."
    He said some workflow products have standard in-baskets that
present data to help users choose their next work item.  Accounts
payable applications, for example, might list each pending item's
invoice number, amount and vendor name.  However, most workflow
products require users to program their own in-boxes.

*Process modeling tools.  
    A growing number of workflow products offer tools for simulating
the effects of workflow changes on an operation's productivity,
resources, throughput, cycle time and costs, he said.  These programs,
which can be run on a laptop computer, also detail the duration of
each task, the location of potential bottlenecks and the number of
employees needed for each step.

*Work management.  
    "Work isn't typically routed to [a specific employee], it is
routed to a particular job category or skill set, which can change
depending on who's doing that task each day," he said.  Some products
allow organizational models to be built into the software so if an
item needs to be routed to a manager, for example, the system knows
which manager oversees that type of work.

*Work tracking.  
    "This is incredibly important, but poorly implemented in many
workflow products," Silver said.  End users should make certain that
the tracking privileges in workflow products are available to system
operators, such as customer representatives, and not just
administrators, he suggested.
    Users also should look for products that allow operators to
search for work items by keying in invoice numbers or customer names,
Silver said.  "Few products provide this type of tracking without
additional programming," he said.  

*Reusable tasks.  
    Ask vendors whether they plan to provide reusable tasks, which
are programs that can be used in more than one workflow application. 
    Also:  Consider each workflow product's server platform,
databases, exceptions handling, messaging infrastructure, programming
language, forms handling, document support and routing rules.  (Bruce
Silver, 617/237-6879.)

COMPANIES CAN SAVE MONEY WITH SPEECH AGENTS IN CALL CENTERS

    Companies will be able to hire fewer human customer service
representatives by incorporating a natural-sounding automated agent
into call centers.  Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa., demonstrated its
Natural Language Understanding technology at the Retail Delivery
Conference in Atlanta recently and to DC during an interview.
    "In the top 100 banks in the United States, there are 80,000 to
100,000 customer service representatives on the phone lines now and
call volumes are expected to double," said Joe Yaworski, general
manager of the natural language understanding program at Unisys.  "Are
they going to try and find a better way or hire twice as many people?"

Mortgage System Uses Natural Language 

    Unisys first is rolling out a mortgage loan application system
that uses the natural language engine to "speak" to callers. 
Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, wants Unisys to use the
engine to custom-build a bill-paying application, said William Randle,
senior vice president of marketing and strategic planning at the bank.
      Unisys also is working with three as-yet-unidentified banks to
develop and deploy the mortgage application.  A commercial product
based on the natural language platform will be available this year. 
"We are targeting banking because of the growth in call centers,"
Yaworski said.
    In Unisys' first demonstration, potential mortgage loan
applicants call the system, which asks whether they would like to know
about fixed or adjustable rate loans.  Once the callers select the
types of loan, the system will ask about other details, such as how
much of a down payment they have and how many points they are willing
to pay.  
    Callers can ask to be transferred to an agent at any time during
the call or can ask the system questions that the automated agent will
answer.  Unisys expects its natural language engine to go into a wide
range of applications eventually, Yaworski said, from the
telemarketing to the credit card industries.  Third-party developers
who want to create applications using the engine can buy a developer's
kit from Unisys.  Unisys will gain revenues from sales of the engine
needed to run those applications.
    Natural Language Understanding technology emerged from funding
that Unisys received for the U.S. Department of Defense in the early
1980s for a project to create technology that could analyze text
documents.  
    Unisys sold off its defense business last year but kept the
speech technology to market it to banks.  (Unisys, 215/986-4788;
Huntington Bancshares, 614/480-8600.)
