I.	Introduction

A. Summary
	The Center for Democracy and Technology files these comments in 
opposition to the America's Carriers Telecommunication Association ("ACTA")
Petition, which asks the Commission to engage in rule-making concerning 
"Internet telephony" real-time audio software applications and to immediately 
prohibit companies and individuals from distributing such software.<SUP>1</SUP>   The Center 
strongly opposes ACTA's requests.
	The ACTA Petition's request for immediate relief would put the Commission 
in the position of dictating how individuals use the network communications 
services which are available to them through the Internet. The request is equivalent 
to the post office asking the Commission to tell individuals that they cannot use 
faxes, or that they cannot send email. The Commission's traditional responsibility 
has been the underlying network and communications media and services, not how 
individuals use those services.  Moreover, ACTA's petition would involve the 
Commission in intrusive regulation of computer software at the highest levels of 
the network protocol stack -- a highly innovative area the Commission has wisely 
thus far been wary of interfering with. For these reasons, CDT believes the 
Commission should deny ACTA's requests for Special Relief, a Declaratory Ruling, 
and Institution of Rulemaking. To date, the Internet has flourished as a 
revolutionary communications medium which enhances the free expression 
opportunities and diversity of information available to all Americans. The 
Commission should consider carefully any call to stifle the continued growth of this 
medium.

B. Statement of Interest
	The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is an independent, non-
profit public interest policy organization in Washington, D.C. The Center's mission 
is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance individual 
liberty and democratic values in new digital communications media. The Center 
achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition 
building. CDT's staff has worked extensively on issues concerning free speech, 
privacy, and other issues affecting democratic values in new digital media, 
particularly with regard to the Internet. CDT is pleased to have this opportunity to 
comment publicly on this new request for rule-making and special relief that 
implicates many of it's long-standing concerns about the democratic potential of the 
new digital media.

	CDT is particularly concerned that the voice of Internet users be heard in this 
Request for Comments. The requests made by ACTA in its petition require the 
Commission to take intrusive and unprecedented steps in the regulation of one of 
the most quickly growing areas of new communications media - the Internet. The 
Internet today is characterized by high growth, innovation, and an unprecedented 
opportunity to promote the free flow of information for individuals and businesses 
throughout the U.S. and around the world.  As such, CDT believes that any 
regulatory steps taken with regard to Internet telephony must be considered in light 
of fundamental communications policy objectives:  free expression, access to a 
diversity of information sources, and access to high quality innovative services.

II.	ACTA's Requests Would Restrict the Free Expression and 
Communications Capability of Computer Users

A. Background: Internet Telephony Applications are Just One of Many New 
Communications Tools Available to Computer Users

	The ACTA Petition refers to the growing class of applications software that 
carry audio in real-time over underlying Internet network services. Today, "Internet 
telephony" software programs generally provide some form of voice conferencing 
in real time between software packages running on computers at both ends of the 
communication. These programs commonly utilize packet-based communications 
services available through the Internet, but could also operate over private 
networks such as increasingly popular "Intranets."
	Despite claims in the ACTA Petition, these services are not provided at no 
charge. Users must already own the extensive hardware and software platform 
required to connect to the Internet, and to run the real-time audio conferencing 
software. This investment may also include microphones and speakers that many 
computer systems do not already have. Most significantly, users must also pay for 
the connection fees charged their Internet Service Provider.
	Real-time audio programs provide just one example of many new 
communications choices being made by individuals and companies that utilize the 
Internet and other new digital networks. Among the range of increasingly popular 
applications available to today's computer users are:  electronic mail, which remains 
one of the most popular application on the Internet; "chat" applications, such as 
Internet Relay Chat or many other proprietary services, which allow real-time text-
based communication; audio applications, such as RealAudio [tm], which have been 
increasingly popular on the World Wide Web and allow users and publishers to 
exchange audio in both real-time and otherwise; and video applications, including 
real-time video conferencing software.  
	The ACTA Petition would require the Commission to regulate otherwise 
indistinguishable data packets on the basis of what they contain. From the point of 
view of the underlying communications services that real-time audio software use, 
the data packets generated by audio software are virtually indistinguishable from 
these other applications. Whether generated by real-time audio conferencing 
software, electronic mail, or video file transfers, the digital data make use of the 
same underlying network communications services and have the same form.

B. ACTA's Request Would Restrict the Ability of Computer Users to Freely Decide 
How They Use Underlying Communications Services and to Choose 
Communications Applications That Best Meet Their Needs

	The ACTA requests would not restrict a basic communications service, but 
rather a specific and indistinguishable application that makes use of underlying 
communications services. ACTA's request for special relief and rule-making singles 
out a particular type of application for regulation, based solely on the contents of the 
data packets it sends. 
	The request would place the Commission in the place of preventing 
individuals from choosing the types of software applications that best meet their 
needs.  ACTA asks the Commission to end the distribution of real-time audio 
products alone. Computer users may use email or video-conferencing applications, 
but not real-time audio conferencing. They may use audio applications that do not 
involve real-time exchange; presumably they may use audio applications that 
involve mutual broadcast of audio, so long as there is no real-time, one-to-one 
exchange. If the post office sought to have individuals enjoined from using faxes or 
telephones to send their messages, the Commission would object to this check on 
the legitimate choices of users and the benefits of competition. CDT believes that the 
Commission should deny Petitioners analogous requests in this instance. 

III.	The Commission Should Avoid Highly Intrusive Regulation of 
Specific Applications at the Highest Layer of the 
Communications Protocol Stack

A. The "Layered" Internet Communications Protocol Stack

	The success of the Internet is often attributed to, among other things, the 
"layered" approach of its architecture. (See Fig. 1 below)  This architectural 
separation of underlying network services from applications allows developers and 
users at each "layer" to abstract or ignore many of the specifics of underlying 
network technologies.  This approach has allowed applications and underlying 
communications services they make use of to evolve and innovate. It also 
distinguishes applications, such as real-time audio software, that use 
communications services, from lower layer software such as implementations of 
the Transport Control Protocol of the Internet Protocol, which provide 
communications service to higher layer applications.


Fig. 1 - The Internet Layered Architecture and Examples

Application Layer		Electronic Mail
IRC and other Real-Time Text Exchange
Audio Conferencing
Video Conferencing 
Word Processing, Financial Software, and many,
many others applications.

Transport Layer		Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

Network Layer	Internet Protocol (IP)



B. The Commission Should Continue To Avoid Regulation at the Application 
Layer In Order to Maintain Innovation and Competition

	The ACTA Petition calls for the Commission to grant Special Relief and 
institute Rule-Making proceedings regarding a specific type of software that is part of 
the Application Layer of the Internet communications protocol stack. The 
Commission should avoid this new form of regulation. 
	The application layer in particular represents an area characterized by 
innovation that has led to tremendous benefits for users. It is better left to those 
forces of innovation than the intrusive regulation of specific applications requested 
by the ACTA Petition. The Special Relief sought by ACTA would require the 
Commission to involve itself with choices about software applications that make 
use of underlying network communications services in a way indistinguishable 
from other applications. The Commission should allow these new technologies to 
develop -- and to succeed or fail in the market depending on the expressed choices 
made by users. 
	Allowing these technologies to develop unhindered may also lead to the 
competition that computer users have long desired from the packagers and 
presenters of underlying communications services.  It might be noted that it is 
exactly this competition that the ACTA petitioners fear -- the development by 
innovative software providers of the means of taking advantage of existing 
communications service that are more efficient and more attractive than packaging 
that ACTA currently provides. 
	The Commission has thus far wisely avoided making regulatory choices at 
the applications level. The Commission has exercised similar judgment in the past 
in other contexts such as Enhanced Services, and should do so in the area of Internet 
applications as well.

IV.	Congress Has Specifically Decided That it is the Policy of the 
United States Not to Regulate Internet Access Software, Such 
As Real-Time Audio Software, As the ACTA Petition Would 
Require

	The ACTA Petition proposes exactly the sort of regulation of the Internet  that 
Congress expressly stated that it intended to avoid when it passed the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996. In legislative findings with regard to the 
regulation of the Internet, Congress expressly stated: 

It is the policy of the United States -- 

(1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and other 
interactive computer services and other interactive media;
(2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists 
for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal 
and State regulation; . . . .<SUP>2</SUP>  
Congress specifically included in it's definition of "interactive computer services," 
the category of "access software providers":

"[A] provider of software (including client or server software), or enabling 
tools that do one or more of the following: . . . (C) transmit, receive, display, 
forward, cache, search, subset,  organize, reorganize, or translate content."<SUP>3</SUP> 

Real-time audio software clearly falls under the rubric of access software providers 
that Congress went out of it's way to protect under the recently passed 
Telecommunications Act. The special relief and rule-making sought by ACTA 
would directly interfere with the "the vibrant and competitive free market that 
presently exists for the Internet."

V.	Conclusion 
	CDT believes that the ACTA request for special relief would immediately 
restrict the ability of computer users to choose the communications applications that 
best meet their needs.  The ACTA petition would require that the Commission 
arbitrarily regulate the sale and use of one of the many new communications 
applications available today.  ACTA would involve the Commission in regulation 
of the application layer of the network protocol stack, contrary to its previously 
expressed deference to innovation and competition in this arena. Finally, Congress 
has recently and explicitly expressed its intent to avoid just the sort of regulation of 
the Internet and interactive communications software that ACTA proposes.  For 
these reasons, CDT urges the Commission to deny each of the requests of the ACTA 
petition.

Respectfully Submitted,

Center for Democracy and Technology
