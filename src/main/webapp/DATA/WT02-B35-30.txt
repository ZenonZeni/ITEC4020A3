DONG/AMERADA PROBE NEW DANISH N SEA GASLINE

Denmark's state owned Dansk Olie og Naturgas (Dong) and Amerada Hess
A/S, local unit of US Amerada Hess Corp, are jointly investigating a
possible DKr1.5-2.5bn ($270.7-451m) new gas transport system in the
Danish North Sea, potentially tapping Norwegian and UK supplies as well
as Danish gas.  The move follows acceptance by Dong of an Amerada
proposal to participate in a joint study of the technical and economic
feasibility of building a new system.  Faced with rapidly growing
natural gas demand in Denmark Dong is currently investigating further
gas supplies.

Dong already owns the existing pipeline system transporting natural gas
from Central Graben fields in the southwestern Danish North Sea to
shore on the west coast of Jutland.  Announcing the new investigation
late last month, Amerada noted the existing system has an annual
transport capacity of about 7.5 Bcm.  This corresponds to the total
amount of gas Dansk Undergrunds Consortium, hitherto Dong's sole
supplier, is able to deliver to Dong from 1997.  "With these deliveries
the existing gas transport system will be nearing its capacity," said
Amerada.

"From the turn of the century, Dong expects to be able to sell
additional gas in the region of two billion cubic metres per annum
which entails securing new gas supplies.  Taken together, this means
that there is a need for a new system which will also give improved
security of supply for the Danish market."  Amerada is an operator and
participant in several exploration licences in the Danish sector while
Dong is a part owner, with a typical 20% share in all licences awarded
since 1984.

Amerada says it expects to start Danish sector production soon, with
one discovery for which it has expectations being the South Arne field
in licence 7/89.  This saw a promising production test earlier last
year.  "A new gas transport system would be able to gather gas from
both South Arne as well as other smaller fields and could also be
linked to the Norwegian system," said Amerada.  Amerada and Dong would
"in appropriate circumstances" seek cooperation with other field
owners.

Some of these smaller fields would not be economic if they had to bear
the costs of a transport infrastructure on their own, said Amerada.
"Apart from transporting gas from any smaller Danish fields there may
also be a possibility to transport gas to Denmark from the UK, German
and Norwegian sectors.  Depending on which technical solution is the
most attractive, the transport system would require an investment of
approximately 1.5-2.5bn Danish Kroner (C.#170-280 million)."

The accompanying map (see hard copy) shows the existing transport
systems for oil and natural gas from Danish Undergrunds Consortium's
fields in the Central Graben in the southwestern Danish North Sea.  The
dotted line indicates a potential new transport sytem for natural gas
emanating from the South Arne field in the western Danish North Sea.
Amerada notes there are unutilised fields on Danish as well as on
German, English and Norwegian territory.

BP/SONATRACH IN ALGERIAN GAS PUSH ON EUROPE

BP just before Christmas announced signing of a major potential $3.5bn
gas deal with Algerian state oil and gas firm Sonatrach which marks a
key new strategic phase in Algeria's push for future gas sales in
Europe and a major advance for BP's ambitions to boost its
international gas business. The two companies signed an agreement to
explore for and produce gas in the remote Sahara Desert and,
particularly significantly, to market it jointly in Europe, notably
southern Europe.

Algerian industry and energy minister Ammar Makhloufi said the BP deal
could be a model for other similar projects; Exxon is reportedly to
start negotiations on a possible natural gas deal close to the BP
location. Algeria's bloody struggle between Islamic militants and
government security forces has not so far deterred energy firms; while
the bulk of oil and gas fields are in the south of the country most
violence has been in the north.

Commenting on the new deal, BP chief executive John Browne said: "This
is a landmark agreement which could increase BP's worldwide gas
production by 30%. It is the first major gas joint venture a foreign
company has signed with Sonatrach, the sole gas producer in Algeria for
the past 30 years. It has the potential to open up a new area of gas
production in Algeria and, from the next decade onwards, to give
European consumers greater choice in their sources of gas supply."

Under the deal, which follows two years of negotiations, BP will
initially appraise known gas finds and search for additional reserves
in the In Salah region of District 3 some 1,200 km south of Algiers.
The licence area is about 25,000 sq km or 20% of the total District 3
area and BP said the area was believed to be capable of producing about
10 Bcm/yr of gas by the early part of the next century; the area has
yielded no liquids to date and they are not expected.

Present BP global gas output is about 13 Bcm/yr, most in the North Sea.
Current estimates are that the Algerian licence area holds about 10 Tcf
split equally between existing finds and future discoveries. Subject to
proving sufficient reserves, gas would be transported north via a new
pipeline (see map in hard copy) to link with Algeria's existing
pipeline system and then onwards by pipe to Europe to be marketed
jointly by a new company to be owned 50:50 by BP and Sonatrach. First
gas is looked for about 2002-2003.

BP said it was planning to spend about $100m on an initial two to three
year appraisal and exploration programme and later investment decisions
would be needed for subsequent stages of the project. The deal requires
approval of the European Union as well as ratification by Algerian
authorities. BP Exploration chief executive Rodney Chase said BP would
shortly start seismic work in the In Salah region and was planning to
drill nine appraisal and exploration wells to establish location and
size of known reserves and to find new fields. The licence area holds
seven known gasfields and 750 sq km of 3D seismic will be shot over
these, plus drilling of five appraisal wells. A separate exploration
area in the licence has a work programme of 2,000 sq km of 2D seismic
and four exploration wells

Depending on success of this initial phase, full development would
require construction of a 520 km, 48-inch diameter pipeline to take gas
to Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's gas hub, linking up to the new Maghreb
gasline to Spain and the TransMed system to Italy, and then on to
market. LNG export is not envisaged. Pipeline construction could cost
up to $1,000m, with full cost of the project estimated at some $3,500m
over a five year period. BP would fund 65% of this investment and
Sonatrach the remainder. BP is expected to get about 30% of net profits
over the full 20-30 year life of the project. The pipeline is big
enough to carry gas from other concessions.

NIGERIA LNG SEALS MAJOR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT

Nigeria LNG Ltd (NLNG) late last year turned a deaf ear to continued
international calls for reprisals against Nigeria's military regime for
its execution of minority Ogoni activists (IGR 289/21) and kept the
long delayed Bonny LNG project on the rails with final award of the
main project construction contract. The company said the move started
the final phase of the project which main foreign partner Shell noted
has so far taken 30 years to bring to fruition. The lump sum turnkey
contract, reportedly worth about $3bn, has been confirmed to a
contracting consortium of France's Technip, Italian Snamprogetti, MW
Kellogg of the US and Japan's JGC.

It covers engineering, procurement and construction for the
liquefaction plant at Finima, Bonny Island, together with associated
facilities and the gas transmission system to collect natural gas from
producers. NLNG said the contractors were "obliged to ensure maximum
Nigerian input during construction and to follow strict regulations to
ensure environmental impact protection". Shell, holder of 25.6% of the
project and technical leader, said until now there had been no way to
dispose of large volumes of associated gas produced with oil in the
Delta region.

If the construction contract had not been signed by end-1995 a complex,
interdependent series of other contracts, including contracts for
export of Nigerian gas, would have collapsed, terminating the LNG
project with little hope of revival. It again stressed the benefits of
the project for jobs and the environment - through cuts in gas flaring -
 and that no dividends would accrue to shareholders, which include the
Nigerian state, until after 2007.

Shell Development Co of Nigeria managing director Brian Anderson said:
"We recognise there have been calls for the project to be halted as a
gesture of political protest. We respect these views and understand the
concerns they reflect. But we cannot accept that this would-contribute
to the good of Nigeria." Other partners in NLNG are Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp with a 49% stake, France's Elf with 15% and Italy's Agip
with 10.4%.

MAJOR ITALY-NORWAY GAS DEAL FLAGGED

Agreement appears imminent in negotiations on a supply deal to
establish Norway as a major source of natural gas for Italy. Antonio
Badini, Italian ambassador in Oslo, is quoted in the weekly Mondo
Economico as saying: "It's now a question of several weeks, the time
for settling the last details." The agreement was said by the magazine
to provide for the Eni group's Snam to import 10-12 Bcm/yr from the
Norwegian North Sea for an annual value of L1,500bn ($940m). It would
run for 20 years, from 1999/2000. The magazine added that Norwegian
commerce minister Gete Knudsen discussed the matter on a recent visit
to Italy.

The Eni group gives no further details than those already disclosed by
Snam. The negotiations, Snam said last month, are with the GFU
consortium of Norwegian producers and the gas would be landed at
Dunkerque, France under arrangements with Gaz de France. A pipeline
would have to be laid across French territory to bring the gas to
Montcenis on the Italian border. Little has been made known about the
pipeline scheme and various aspects are reported still under discussion
such as whether it would be owned by Gaz de France alone or jointly
with Snam.

The advantage for Snam is that in Norway it will gain a secure major
source, at much lower political risk than the two existing leading
suppliers, Algeria and Russia. It already imports lesser quantities
from a low risk source, Holland, but here the availability is limited.

PTT PLANS THAI WEST/EAST GASLINE

The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is embarking on a 7.27bn baht
($290.8m) investment project for a new natural gas pipeline spanning
from Thailand's western region to the east. The new gasline, 28 inches
in diameter and 200 km long, will be laid from Ratchaburi province to
link with PTT's existing gas grid at the Bangkok South Power plant in
Samut Prakan and Wang Noi in Ayutthaya. According to PTT, the west-to-
east line is geared to respond to greater natural gas demand by
industries and future power stations operated by independent power
producers (IPPs) along the route.

The gasline will form an integral part of the larger pipeline, 42
inches in diameter and 300 km long, to be laid from the Thai-Burmese
border at Kanchanaburi province to a 1,800 MW combined cycle plant to
be built by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat). The
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi gasline, estimated to cost 16.5bn baht, will
transport natural gas from Burma's offshore Yadana and Yetagun
gasfields to Thailand. PTT has just received Cabinet endorsement for
investing in the two gasline projects. The west-to-east pipeline is
scheduled operational in 1999, a year after expected completion of the
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi stretch.

At present, PTT, the Thai state oil and gas firm, is selecting
companies to provide engineering consultancy services for the
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi gasline project, PTT officials said. Meanwhile,
the Cabinet has signalled a green light for PTT to proceed with a
1.47bn baht investment in another gas pipeline scheme - a 24-inch, 100
km stretch - from Tantawan gasfield in the Gulf of Thailand to tie in
with PTT's Gulf grid. The approval came after PTT sealed an agreement
with the group led by US-based Pogo Producing for long-term natural gas
supply from Tantawan. The Tantawan gasline is scheduled complete at end-
1997, before starting delivery of 100 MMcfd to PTT (IGR 287/18).

SYRIAN GAS OUTPUT POISED TO DOUBLE

Plans have been put together that will see a doubling of Syrian gas
production by 2000. A recent study into reserves and prospects leads
the oil ministry to give the green light to projects aimed at utilising
a flow of over 16 MMcmd. Four schemes will make this possible, the
biggest being the start of production from fields near Palmyra. These
are due to start up at 3 MMcmd when first-stage development is
completed in 1996. A second stage development will double that to 6
MMcmd during 1997.

Also near Palmyra will be Marathon's oilfield development, expected to
yield some 1.1 MMcmd of associated gas by 2000. Final scheme involves
expansion of production and processing capacity at the Jbeissah
gasfield, where output will rise from 1.7 MMcmd now to 2.5 MMcmd.

Getting this new gas to market will involve laying of 1,160 km of new
pipeline. Utilisation will come mainly from new power plants such as
that at al-Zara (IGR 289/22), fertiliser production, refinery use, iron
and steel production and general industrial use. By 2000, these will
absorb 12.85 MMcmd. Distribution through domestic grids will take 3.5
MMcmd.

GADONNEIX TAKES HELM AT GAZ DE FRANCE

Pierre Gadonneix has succeeded Loik le Floch-Prigent as president of
Gaz de France (GdF). The latter - who has socialist credentials as well
as a reputation for competent management - was sent in to pacify state
railway company Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF) whose
employees were at the vanguard of the recent wave of French strikes. It
was third time lucky for Gadonneix, appointed general manager of GdF in
July 1987. In 1988, when Jacques Fournier left, Gadonneix saw Francis
Gutmann get the top job. In 1993, le Floch-Prigent was appointed over
his head.

Choice of the highly qualified Gadonneix - who has a doctorate from the
Harvard Business School, as well as attending France's elite technical
university Ecole Polytechnique, and the specialised Ecole Nationale
Superieure du Petrole et des Moteurs - also contrasts with the recent
politically motivated appointment of Edmond Alphandery at the head of
GdF's sister organisation Electricite de France. But like Alphandery,
Gadonneix will take part in nominating his deputy, which will
strengthen his presidential authority. Among names being mentioned for
the general manager's post are current deputy general manager Jean
Balazuc, as well as director of the industry ministry's energy
department Claude Mandil, and Michel Francony, director of EdF-GdF
Services (which manages both utilities' distribution systems).

It remains to be seen to what extent Gadonneix will pursue the
internationalist and market oriented policies of his predecessor. He
must renegotiate the company's charter, which defines its activities.
At home GdF faces challenges from both electricity and fuel oil and
could face challenges to its monopoly of gas distribution from such
established service companies as Generale des Eaux or Lyonnaise des
Eaux. Internationally, Gadonneix will have to manage assets already
acquired in Canada, Uruguay and US. Eventually, he will also have to
face pressure from Brussels to deregulate, even if the European
Commission has decided to focus its attention on deregulating the
electricity market in the first instance, and is taking its time.

In his time at the industry ministry, Gadonneix worked with liberally
inclined ministers such as Michel d'Ornano, Rene Monory and Alain
Madelin. But he will face fierce opposition from the trade unions to
any proposals along the lines of le Floch-Prigent's plans to exchange
shareholdings with Russian gas company Gazprom, even if current
industry minister Franck Borotra favours selling minority stakes to an
Elf or a Statoil, or to individuals.

* GdF is to pay the state a dividend of FFr970m ($198.34m) for 1995,
while Electricite de France is to pay FFr1.5bn, according to figures
published in the official journal.

POWER DEAL HOPES DASHED

Forecasts of an accord by EU energy ministers on electricity market
liberalisation last month (IGR 289/16) proved unfounded. The thorny
issue - with gas liberalisation even further away from agreement-- now
falls in the lap of Italy which took over EU presidency from Spain on 1
January this year.

HYDRO SEEKS 2000 OSEBERG GAS

Norsk Hydro has now submitted a NKr3.6bn ($569.8m) plan to Norway's
industry and energy ministry for development and operation of gas
reserves at its North Sea Oseberg field, with start of gas exports
targeted at 2000. Development would be via a new steel gas process and
export platform linked to the Oseberg field centre with gas exports
tied into the existing pipeline system in the Heimdal area. Recoverable
Oseberg gas reserves are put at 115 Bcm and average gas export at 4
Bcm/yr during 2000-2010, rising to 10 Bcm/yr thereafter.

Investment costs are estimated at NKr2.5bn for the field installations
and NKrl.lbn for the pipeline. Oseberg started oil production in 1988,
now running at some 0.5m b/d. Meanwhile, Norwegian state oil and gas
firm Statoil has now submitted a development and operation plan to the
ministry for the mid-Norwegian Aasgard field. A verdict on whether gas
from the project will be processed at Kaarstoe or Kollsnes remains
outstanding.

GAS DELIVERIES HIT NEW PEAK

Norwegian gas deliveries to continental Europe hit a new peak in early
December because of cold weather, according to state oil and gas firm
Statoil. Daily gas delivery orders received by the gas sales centre at
Stavanger and the Bygnes operations centre set the record during
December 5-8. Almost 55 MMcmd was piped through the Europipe and
Statpipe/Norpipe systems to Emden, Germany and the Zeepipe trunkline to
Zeebrugge, Belgium. With deliveries from Ekofisk on top, these sales
ensured maximum Norwegian deliveries in response to Europe's cold
weather, said Statoil.

Hydrocarbons were found in 64% of wells drilled on Norway's continental
shelf last year but most were small, according to state oil and gas
company Statoil. Proven reserves are put at roughly 320m bbls of oil
and 75 Bcm of natural gas, it said. Figures are provisional as some of
the biggest finds have yet to complete testing.

EIB BACKS 'YAMAL' LINE

The European Investment Bank (EIB) is willing to finance up to 15% of
the cost of the Polish section of the planned 'Yamal' natural gas
pipeline from Russia to Germany, according to bank deputy president
Wolfgang Roth. The Polish section, to be built and operated by EuroPol
Gaz, a joint venture of Russian and Polish state firms Gazprom and
PGNiG, is expected to cost $2.5bn. The EIB is already financing the
$3.2bn Midal-Stegal gas pipeline system in Germany. Roth said
Commerzbank, which led commercial banks in a $940m funding of Midal-
Stegal, was expected to play a leading role in arranging funds for the
Polish line.

NORFRA GROUP URGES SHORT LOOP

A 15-20 km by-pass loop linking Norway's Statpipe and Norpipe gas
trunklines around the Ekofisk centre, should replace the existing
connection via the North Sea field, according to state oil and gas firm
Statoil. It has put the proposal forward as operator of the NorFra
partnership planning a gasline from Norway to Dunkirk, France. A
government decision is expected by 1 March.

Costed at NKr500m ($79.14m), the short loop is preferred by NorFra
partners to a longer 150 km alternative, said Statoil. Due ready by
summer 1998, it will feed gas from fields including Statfjord and
Gullfaks into the Norpipe line to Emden. Completion will coincide with
completion of new facilities at Ekofisk which will in future handle gas
from Ekofisk alone.

which aims to supply natural gas from the Troll gas terminal at
Kollsnes, near Bergen, according to Statoil. With share capital of
NKr680,000 ($107,627), the firm (name changed from Vestgas for the
share issue that brought in Statoil and Hydro) plans to deliver some 10-
20 MMcm of gas a year to local industry and, in compressed form, to bus
operators. Other shareholders include Hordaland county council, four
local authorities and local industry.

CLYDE GETS TRIPLE GREEN LIGHT

UK independent Clyde Petroleum has won Dutch authorities' approval for
simultaneous development of three satellite gasfields offshore the
Netherlands, all via tie-back to the existing P/6-A process facilities.
Total project cost for developing P/2-NE and P/2-SE, both Rotliegendes
fields, is put at Fls165m ($102.9m). First gas from the former is due
in early 1997 and from the latter in mid-1997. Total project cost for
development of the P/6 South field is put at Fls40m. First gas here is
due by end-1996. Total base case reserves for the three developments
are put at 112 Bcf gross.

TURKMEN OUTPUT SET TO RISE

Turkmenistan plans to produce 41.5 Bcm of natural gas this year,
exporting 30 Bcm, according to a draft 1996 budget passed by parliament
early last month. According to official Neutral Turkmenistan newspaper,
however, the Central Asian republic could produce up to 64 Bcm this
year. That would be back in line with the 1993 tally of 63.5 Bcm before
Russia cut off Turkmen pipe access to Europe. Production in 1994
slumped to 35.6 Bcm and was planned at 34.6 Bcm last year. An increase
is now expected in the wake of the recent deal setting up joint Russo-
Turkmen gas firm Turkmenrosgaz including Gazprom on the Russian side.

COLD SPELLS GOOD/BAD BG NEWS

Record low temperatures brought good news and bad news for beleaguered
British Gas over the Christmas/New Year period. Gas demand hit new
highs with the previous peak in England and Wales exceeded by 2% while
in Scotland, where temperatures fell as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius
in Glasgow, demand was 10% up on the previous high. BG said it was
managing to meet demand in England from storage and higher North Sea
production. In Scotland it was interrupting supply to businesses with
interruptible contracts. Bottled gas supplier Calor said it was selling
50% more gas than a year earlier.

Coming during a time of low industrial activity because of the holiday
period, the demand rise was attributable virtually entirely to higher
heating use. Spot natural gas prices firmed on the cold but the rise
was modest, about 0.25p/therm to around 10.5p, as only the
industrial/commercial market is deregulated as yet. With the current UK
gas glut posing major problems for BG, the higher cold weather demand
was welcome as one way of helping reduce the surplus.

But this good news came hand in hand with bad as BG faced making
compensation payments to thousands of customers for failure to respond
swiftly when central heating systems broke down. The problem focussed
on 3-star service contracts, for which customers pay over #100
($152.3m) a year with an expectation of attention within 24 hours of
notifying a breakdown. BG denied staff cuts were to blame for delays
and said weather conditions were exceptional. But the Gas Consumers
Council said it had tracked an increase in 3-star contract complaints
before Christmas and the cold snap.

BG APPOINTS CONTRACTS GURU

British Gas has now appointed a special negotiator to handle the take-
or-pay gas contracts problem that has faced it with costly write-downs.
At the same time it has indicated first producers to agree to
renegotiate contracts with BG will get best terms. So far North Sea
producers have shown no inclination to revamp long term take-or-pay
contracts to supply BG at prices well above current competitive market
levels. Job of BG's new chief negotiator Kenneth Gardener, a director
of Charterhouse Bank, is to persuade producers to come to the table.

Gardener, who took on his new post on 1 January, has given up executive
duties at Charterhouse but remains a director. On his appointment last
month he acknowledged producers would be reluctant to re-open legally
binding contracts but said he believed a "win win" position could
emerge from negotiations. He has agreed to give at least two years to
the problem. Meanwhile, BG has also indicated it will increase pressure
on producers after 1 February when the supply contracts will be
transferred to a new trading subsidiary.

News of the troubleshooter appointment was one factor in a sharp pre-
Christmas rally in BG shares which added some 9% in just a couple of
days, the price rising to 250p ($3.88); other factors were record cold
weather and renewed market speculation, so far unfounded, that a bid
may emerge for BG from the likes of Shell or BP. BG also underlined the
increased significance of legal issues in its affairs with appointment
of William Friedrich, formerly with international law firm Shearman &
Sterling, as its general counsel. Other recent senior appointments
include promotion of Harry Moulson, head of BG pipe unit TransCo, to
executive director and of Dr Pierre Jungels, formerly with Belgium's
Petrofina, as managing director, exploration and production.

HOMES COMPETITION 'ON COURSE'

The UK government is pressing ahead with a pilot trial of domestic gas
market competition this spring despite claims that necessary systems
are not ready. Some 0.5m household customers in southwest England are
due to be offered a choice of supplier, breaking the current British
Gas monopoly, from 1 April. BG pipeline unit TransCo sought delay of
the trial, expressing concern over lack of time for computer testing.
But in the run-up to Christmas industry and energy minister Tim Eggar
rejected the move.

Instead, it was agreed gas regulator Ofgas should appoint a
'troubleshooter' or 'controller' to ensure problems are sorted out and
the timetable is maintained. Following the offer from Amerada Hess of
savings of some 15% on current levels for households switching from BG,
Total has waded in with announced savings of up to 16%, with Swebgas,
regional electricity company in the southwest area, offering savings of
at least 17%. Texaco has also joined forces with LPG market leader
Calor to chase the domestic and small commercial natural gas markets.
BG has yet to reveal its hand on how it will respond to the household
market challenge.

MINISTER RESIGNATION HITS GAS TAX

Resignation and replacement of Austrian finance minister Andreas
Staribacher last week [2 January] will likely cause a further delay in
introduction of a tax on gas (IGR 287/12), variously labelled as an
energy, CO2 or environmental levy. Petroleum products came under the
tax last May, with gas, electricity and coal to follow. Originally the
extended tax was expected at the start of this year but parties to the
discussion, ranging from government to electricity and industrial
interests, have been unable to agree a formula which would be fair to
all consumers. Staribacher had argued in favour of the tax on gas on
grounds that the tax should be part of a general energy levy to
encourage reduced consumption, not to promote a shift from one energy
source to another.

As finance minister, he had been under considerable pressure to impose
the broadened tax as part of a programme to ease an unbearably large
budget deficit projected for this year. Staribacher's replacement as
finance minister is Viktor Klima, who leaves his previous post as
minister for state industry, transportation and communications. Before
joining the government, Klima was finance chief at OMV and will likely
be sympathetic to demands of the energy industry in view of OMV's
monopoly over gas imports.

The cabinet reshuffle as well as expected complications in forming a
new government following an indecisive election last month will now
probably postpone any possible introduction of the levy on gas and the
remaining energy resources until after mid-year at earliest. Once a
government is established, the issue of the amount of the tax and the
exceptions (such as gas used for electricity generation) will still
have to be resolved.

EVN/BAYERNWERKE LAND KOGAZ

Success of a joint $87m bid by Germany's Bayernwerke and Austria's
Energieversorgung Niederosterreich (EVN) in the second tender for
Hungary's Kogaz regional gas utility (IGR 289/4) has cemented a
partnership which could have further consequences. The two concerns
increased their offer for Kogaz by some $20m to win in their bid for a
50% plus one share holding in the utility which serves three provinces
in the southwestern part of the country bordering on Slovenia and
Croatia. EVN had hoped rather to gain a shareholding in a gas utility
bordering on Austria, making supply synergies possible, but had to be
content with the Kogaz award.

The Austrian concern has had a co-operation agreement with Kogaz for
some time. Kogaz  supplies about 190,000 customers in a service area
with a population of over 1m. Annual sales of about 700 Bcm are worth
about $6.2m. While EVN was the only Austrian utility to share in
Hungary's gas privatisation, the deal will not bring pleasure to OMV,
which holds a virtual monopoly over gas imports to Austria.

The reason is the stronger relationship which EVN will achieve with
Bayernwerke, seen by OMV and federal electricity authority Verbund as
an unwelcome intruder on the Austrian energy scene. Bayernwerke already
shares with EVN  a holding in Austria's one private gas and oil
producer, Rohol Aufsuchungs AG (RAG). The German concern has made
offers on several Austrian privatisations but has been rebuffed by OMV
and the Verbund with support from the government, which prefers to see
control of the energy sector remain in Austrian hands.

Although Austria's proposed new law governing fixed-location LPG tanks
was published last August, the legislation has not yet been passed.
Industry has urged that the oNORM M 7323 technical standard, virtually
identical to the German TRB 610 standard which took effect as of 1
January 1996, be enacted immediately in Austria. Industry points out
that the German standard was developed at some expense due to extensive
research and testing and that there is no reason the law not be adopted
at once. The regulation would apply to tanks used by private as well as
industry gas consumers.

GWH Gas- u. Warenhandelsgesmbh, a joint venture trading house owned by
Austria's gas import monopoly OMV and Russia's Gazexport, has reported
a successful 1995 with a trading volume of Sch1.9bn ($190m). The firm
was set up in 1994 to expedite dealings between the two concerns and to
overcome Russian currency problems. Under agreements which run until
2012, Gazexport last year supplied about 1.7 Bcm of gas in exchange for
4,000 tonnes (t) of lubricants, 2,000t of polyethylene and about 1.2m
sq metres of geotextiles, with the latter products supplied by OMV's
plastics subsidiaries for use in the Russian gas industry. GWH was also
instrumental in expediting a long-term contract for transport of an
additional 500 MMcm of Russian gas through Austria to Bavaria via OMV
pipelines.

about L262m ($163,000); Arvedi Tubi Acciao, about L135m; and General
Sider Italiana, about L124m. A statement said the three, which have
over 70% of the domestic market, "have falsified the play of
competition in a consistent manner". A fourth firm, Ilva Lamiere e
Tubi, had also been investigated but the authority found insufficient
evidence of its involvement over any length of time.

GERMAN NORTH SEA GAS EYED AGAIN

BEB and its partners in the German North Sea Group are taking another
look at development of gas reserves in the German North Sea. All
options are being looked at and results of a Norwegian Aker study are
expected "at the beginning of 1996". Early in 1995 BEB said it had
taken a look at exploitation prospects for the gas and condensate in
1994 "but with the present state of the Deutschemark and an oil price
of, say, $15/bbl, it is not economic to produce now". That study was
based on a pipeline from the reserves, in blocks A/6-B/4, to Denmark,
and BEB then reckoned "that we need $20/bbl to make the scheme viable".

An offshore power station and a spur line to the Ekofisk-Emden Norpipe
trunkline have been other options considered. Front-running scheme now
is a tie-back to Amoco's Valhall platform in the Norwegian sector. Aker
Engineering is looking at a pipeline from A/6-B/4 via Norwegian, German
and Danish territorial waters (see also separate story). At the fields
a small wellhead platform would be sited in about 50 metres of water.

BEB last drilled a well in the area, B/4-4, in 1992; B/4-3 in 1988 was
a suspended gas find and previous finds had been made in A/6. One
problem with the gas is high nitrogen content. Gas has also been found
in H/15-H/18. BEB tells IGR that a A/6-B/4 "development would require
the drilling of more wells". No drilling elsewhere off Germany is
envisaged by the company in 1996.

REPSOL CONFIRMS T&T DEAL

Spain's oil, gas and chemical conglomerate Repsol confirmed in mid-
December it has bought the 20% stake in Trinidad and Tobago's Atlantic
LNG Co that was offered to Spain's industrial gas distributor Enagas.
Enagas will still buy 40% of the LNG produced at the Trinidad plant to
be built at a cost of $1bn and scheduled onstream in early 1999 (see
separate story). Repsol, whose gas operations now account for 25% of
its profits - Pta42.2bn ($349m) in the first nine months of 1995, up
26.6% - spent $200m on its share, which makes it the third biggest
partner in the 400 MMcfd LNG plant, after Amoco Trinidad LNG Co, an
affiliate of US Amoco Corp with 34%, and British Gas Trinidad LNG with
26%.

The other partners are Cabot Trinidad LNG, an affiliate of Cabot Corp
of the US, and Trinidad's public National Gas Co, with 10% each. The
remaining 60% of the 3m tonnes (t)/yr of LNG that the plant will
produce will be bought by Boston-based Cabot. Enagas and Cabot signed
an initial deal with Atlantic LNG in July and Enagas was given the
option to acquire 20% of the equity.

Although insiders thought Enagas would acquire the share, Repsol's move
is part of its own gas expansion programme. Repsol owns 45.3% of
Spain's domestic gas distributor Gas Natural, which in turn holds 91%
of Enagas. Repsol now has a foot firmly in Trinidad's important gas
market and Enagas will import a further 14.6bn thermies a year of LNG,
equivalent to 18% of Spain's current annual consumption, over a 20-year
period.

Enagas is holding talks with an unnamed shipping company to rent a
125,000t tanker to bring the LNG to Spain's regasification plants at
Huelva and Cartegena, with an option to buy the ship. Enagas has for
some years pursued a policy of expanding and diversifying its supply
sources, to give more flexibility and security to the Spanish gas
sector. A Repsol spokesman said its participation in the project
"strengthens the company's upstream integration and consolidates the
growing importance of natural gas in its activities". The investment
was made through Repsol affiliate Repsol International BV.

Meanwhile, the Spanish Treasury and state industrial holding company
SEPI are negotiating the 'destiny' of the approximate Pta80bn that will
be gained from the sale of 7% of Repsol shares in the New Year. The
state, through SEPI, owns 21% of Repsol and SEPI executives would like
the privatisation cash to help alleviate the Pta700bn debt it was left
with when defunct loss-making holding company INI was closed down last
year and partially replaced by SEPI. Treasury officials are said to
want to use the capital gain to help reduce the public deficit.

NEW SWITCH TO GAS FUEL

The Basque engineering unit of Babcock Wilcox has singed a Pta2bn
($16.5m) contract with southern Spanish utility Sevillana de
Electricidad to convert the fuel oil-fired Bahia de Algeciras power
station to gas use, only the second thermal plant to make the move so
far in Spain. After conversion, the station's boiler will be able to
use fuel oil or gas, or a mixture of both in any proportion. Gas de
Euskadi, owned by the Basque government's energy enterprise Ente Vasco
de la Energia (EVE) and national industrial gas distributor Enagas,
recorded nine-month 1995 gross profits of Pta917m, which compares with
gross profits of just Pta485m for the whole of 1994.

Gas de Euskadi in mid-December inaugurated a new distribution pipeline
in the Zalla district close to Bilbao. The consortium behind the future
Zabalgarbi gas-fired incinerator, the largest energy project under way
in the Basque country, has increased its capital from Pta400m to
Pta1.4bn. The consortium includes EVE and Babcock & Wilcox.

GN QUITS TELECOMS PLAY

Gas Natural has made a joint announcement with electricity utilities
Endesa and Sevillana de Electricidad that they are pulling out of
Spain's third main paging company, Compania Europea de Radiobusqueda
(Cersa), in which each holds a 9% stake. The three energy companies
have had this stake in telecommunications since 1992 through the
consortium Servicio de Radiotelefonia Movil (SRM), which holds 96% of
Cersa. There are two main reasons for the apparent reversal of Spanish
energy companies' diversification into telecommunications.

Late arrival of the paging service in Spain meant three large operators
with important investors emerged in the same year, just as the more
successful mobile telephone sector was taking off. This meant that
Cersa, with 25,000 clients, lost Pta420m ($3.5m) last year. One of
Spain's two leading paging companies is expected to buy the 27% of
shares to be put on offer - Mensatel, run by the semi-public
telecommunications giant Telefonia, or Sistelcom-Telemensaje, a
consortium which includes two utilities, Union Fenosa and Fecsa.

PGNIG IN FRESH NORWAY MOVE

Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (PGNiG, Polish Oil and Gas) is
taking a fresh interest in Norwegian gas from the North Sea. The Polish
gas company sees construction of the 292 km, DM3bn ($2.20bn) Netra
pipeline as a fresh opportunity to achieve some of its long standing
ambition of diversifying gas imports away from Russia. The pipeline -
built by a consortium of BEB, Norsk Hydro, Ruhrgas and Statoil - links
the German North Sea terminal at Etzel with the gas distribution
network of the former German Democratic Republic at Salzwedel. This
brings Norwegian gas to within 70 km of the Polish border, so putting
in an additional link to Poland would be a relatively simple matter.

PGNiG hopes to start negotiations with owners of the Norwegian
gasfields in the next three to four months, aiming for deliveries to
start in two or three years. Whether these talks will succeed remains
to be seen. But PGNiG was confident the Norwegians could produce the
gas cheaply enough to deliver it at a price that would be attractive to
the Poles. That would be some $85-95/Mcm at the Polish border,
preferably either in the region of Szczecin or Gorzelec (Goerlitz).

Furthermore, Poland has made considerable economic progress in the last
few years and has made its peace with the London Club of private
creditor banks, thereby improving its credit rating. This should
forestall the kind of difficulties the Poles experienced when they
tried to buy gas from the British North Sea a couple of years ago.
Those talks failed when the owners required payment for three years
ahead, and guarantees of quantities to be bought further ahead than
that.

At the same time, the Norwegian energy minister Jens Stoltenberg has
noted Russian gas supplier Gazprom had grasped that its clients wanted
to diversify supplies and now saw this as a normal condition of doing
business in Europe. France takes no more than 30% of its gas from
Russia and Germany has adopted a similar target after its supplies were
disrupted by a dispute between Russia and the Ukraine, through whose
territory the pipeline feeding Germany runs.

The Poles get nearly 60% of their supplies from Russia, which provides
some 6 Bcm/yr out of a total Polish consumption of some 10.5 Bcm; the
remaining 4.5 Bcm is produced in Poland. It is unlikely any Norwegian
gas would get Poland's dependence on Russia quite as low as 30%. PGNiG
is looking to import perhaps 2 Bcm to 3 Bcm a year from the North Sea,
which would represent no more than 15-20% of demand by the time it
started landing since Poland's gas requirements are expected to rise
sharply - to perhaps 27 Bcm by 2010, depending on growth and fuel mix
assumptions made.

SUBSEA ROUTE FOR CADIZ GAS

Allseas Marine Contractors has been contracted by Repsol
Investigaciones Petroliferas to carry out major work on Gulf of Cadiz
gasfields. Involved are the Poseidon North and Poseidon South fields
some 40 km offshore. Allseas will design, fabricate and install three
subsea manifolds together with 63 km of 10-inch pipeline, split into
three sections. Tie-in work is also involved, both at wellheads and
manifolds. Control umbilicals will also be laid. The work, in up to 132
metres of water, will be carried out early in 1997, using the Lorelay
and Trenchsetter barges. Cost of the development, start-up and
production rates have yet to be released. All gas will flow to shore
for processing in a plant yet to be contracted.

INTERCONNECTOR TRANSIT INTEREST

Belgium's Distrigaz will shortly invite companies to indicate interest
in subscribing for transit pipeline capacity in Belgium linked to the
proposed UK-Zeebrugge Interconnector gas pipeline project. Responses
will be required by February next year at latest. Distrigaz gas supply
and sales director Jean Vermeire last month said he wanted to "remove
some uncertainties that may still exist with respect to our position
on, and the progress of, the planned enhancement of our transit
capacities". He told a Financial Times natural gas conference in London
work on Belgian grid reinforcements required for transit gas flows
associated with the Interconnector was on course.

"I can assure you that all studies and preparatory work are on schedule
to put the required transit capacity in place by October 1998, or such
later date as may be determined by the effective start-up of the
Interconnector or the readiness of new onward connections in transit
destination countries (referred to as the Commissioning Date)," he
said. "In order to determine which transit capacity the market may
require and hence to finalise design and size of new pipelines and grid
reinforcements, Distrigaz will very shortly solicit formal expressions
of interest in subscribing for transit capacity with a view to
concluding long-term transit contracts."

Vermeire said potential shippers willing to enter into such long-term
commitments by the end of second-quarter 1996 - the point at which pipe
and other equipment orders would have to be placed - would then be
assured of availability of the requested transit service from the
Commissioning Date. Subsequent shippers would get different terms. A
detailed information memorandum on transit services on offer was being
made available to potential shippers before end-1995. This would
provide relevant information for shippers to allow them to declare
their interest by February 1996 at the latest. Earlier, he said the go-
ahead decision for the Interconnector could double the gas transit flow
through Belgium - an estimated 15 Bcm this year - by around the turn of
the century.

Dr Burckhard Bergmann, board member of major German gas supplier
Ruhrgas, told the conference many issues still remained open on the
Interconnector (IGR 288/6). These included the destination of the
volumes and how they would be moved on from Zeebrugge. Outlets appeared
feasible which led to a higher netback than the current spot price at
the UK beach. But the question was to what extent it made sense for
producers to commit themselves to these prices on a long-term basis.
There was a wide spectrum of driving forces.

But what was unsatisfactory was that these forces were not geared
towards sustainable developments. Instead, they originated in a UK
disequilibrium which had not ensued from a misjudgement of supply and
demand "but from permanent regulatory intervention. It would be naive
to assume that the currently low spot prices in the UK are the outcome
of liberalisation and the result of high efficiency gains. They are
instead the consequence of a supply overhang resulting largely from the
permanent regulatory corrections made once the privatisation structure
of British Gas in 1986 was found to be unsatisfactory".

Bergmann continued: "What disturbs us, therefore, is not that a
balanced liberal gas market should have repercussions for the west
European Continent via the Interconnector but that there is exposure to
the disequilibrium of the current regulatory transformation and finally
also a growing marginal cost approach to the Interconnector itself."
One key issue, he said, would be whether producers who had participated
in the Interconnector increasingly viewed the investment as a sunk
cost.

Nevertheless, Ruhrgas expected the disequilibrium, and hence the
effects for the north-western part of Continental Europe, to be reduced
via the Interconnector. Although the spot market would not completely
disappear, it would most probably remain confined. The destination for
Interconnector gas on the Continent was still unclear. "Many look to
the German market, the largest but also well-supplied market. A great
deal will depend on whether a substantial quantity can be supplied to
Italy via France. It remains to be seen whether a separate transit
pipeline through Belgium to Germany also materialises.

"There are also other interesting transport opportunities for companies
wishing to obtain gas for Germany from the Interconnector. It must be
borne in mind when constructing a separate pipeline via Belgium - as
with the Interconnector - that the carrying capacity commitments will
cover a longer period than the prospective duration of deliveries."
Bergmann noted that Central European countries were also interested in
obtaining gas from the UK continental shelf. "We support their efforts
in this respect but the long distance makes it very hard to find an
economical solution."

STORAGE WINS GRONINGEN TIME

Development of DFL2.5bn ($1.59bn) worth of natural gas storage in the
Netherlands will meet short to medium term supply needs but extensive
compression, possibly costing DFL4bn, will be needed on the giant Dutch
Groningen field in about a decade to meet future requirements. That is
one of the conclusions of an assessment of Dutch gas storage needs by
consultant Wood Mackenzie*. Main driver is a decline in peak delivery
capacity of leading Dutch gas marketer Gasunie. Dutch oil and gas
company NAM and Amoco of the US are currently working to bring three
peak shaving storage facilities on stream in 1997 (IGR  288/14).
WoodMac notes that with the exception of the Maasvlakte LNG facility,
no dedicated peak shaving/gas storage facilities have been developed in
the Netherlands to date.

This has been avoided by availability of large local gas reserves
together with high production capacity, flexible supply contracts and a
comprehensive infrastructure. Seasonal and short term demand rises have
generally been met through higher output directly from producing
fields. With Dutch output dominated by Groningen, this field has been
conserved as a strategic reserve and swing producer. Last year 42% of
the total annual gas volume (82.1 Bcm) bought by Dutch gas marketer
Gasunie was produced from Groningen. The rest came from other onshore
fields (19%), offshore fields (35%) and imports from Norway (3.5%) and
the UK (0.5%). But during peak demand periods Groningen provides about
75% of deliveries.

As of 1 January 1995 some 2,070 Bcm of gas had been produced in the
Netherlands but Gronigen still holds estimated remaining recoverable
reserves of some 1,275 Bcm, says WoodMac. A further 700 Bcm is held
within other developed fields and future Dutch developments. At current
production rates, reserves are sufficient to supply domestic and export
markets for nearly a quarter of a century. Over the next five years the
analyst expects total gas sales in the Netherlands to rise 5-6% from 44
Bcm in 1995 to 46 Bcm in 2000. With the Netherlands established as a
major gas exporter, Gasunie in 1994 exported 38.3 Bcm, 47% of total
sales; of this 59% went to Germany, 14% to Belgium, 13% to France, 14%
to Italy and 1% to Switzerland. Overall exports are expected to stay
relatively flat in the medium term.

WoodMac reckons domestic Dutch production will rise about 7% from some
82 Bcm/yr currently to about 88 Bcm/yr in 2000. Current imports of
about 3 Bcm/yr from Norway and the UK are expected to rise notably in
the next five years, although not to much over 6 Bcm/yr or 7% of total
Dutch supply. However, these deliveries have relatively limited
flexibility in terms of swing to reflect demand variations. Import
capacity is also partly constrained by Gasunie's role as a transporter
of some 10 Bcm/yr of gas for third parties, including Norwegian
deliveries to France and Belgium.

Moreover, although Dutch output is expected to rise, output from
existing offshore fields and onshore fields other than Groningen is
expected to fall in the late 1990s and after 2000. Consequently,
greater demand will be placed on Groningen production. In the absence
of a major upturn in exploration/development activity, which the
analyst does not currently foresee, or substantially increased imports
(such as could potentially arise through the UK-Belgium
Interconnector), output from Groningen, while falling in the short
term, is expected to rise to about 40 Bcm/yr in 2000.

At the same time, however, the flexibility provided by Groningen is now
being limited by the fall in reservoir pressure in the field and this
problem will be compounded when the higher output levels are needed,
says the report. Therefore, despite its access to more than sufficient
gas volumes to meet projected overall demand for many years to come,
Gasunie has had to initiate projects to maintain its delivery capacity
in order to keep supply and demand in phase as the flexibility of older
fields, particularly Groningen, to provide necessary swing falters.
"This decline in delivery capacity could affect Gasunie's supply
commitments," says WoodMac; "indeed, without the provision of new peak
shaving facilities there is a real possibility that Gasunie would be
unable to supply sufficient gas during a severe winter from 1996."

Of the three new gas storage facilities now planned (see table), two
will be operated by Shell/Esso joint venture NAM (50% holder of
Gasunie) - one at the partly depleted Langelo/Norg gasfield in the
Drenthe concession in the north of the country, the other at the
Grijpskerk gasfield. Amoco will develop the third project at the
Alkmaar field in the Bergen concession, strategically located close to
the large industrial market in the west of the country, notes WoodMac.
The three are due to be phased in from 1997, becoming fully operational
by winter 2000/01, at which stage they should hold some 7 Bcm of gas
and provide peak delivery capacity of 184 MMcmd, the additional
capacity representing about 30% of expected peak demand for Dutch gas
in 2000. In the longer term, Alkmaar could be extended to provide 500
MMcm of storage and a maximum delivery rate of 36 MMcmd, says the
report.

In overall terms, these developments will not boost total delivery
capacity substantially over recent levels, it says. But they will in
general compensate for the declining flexibility of producing fields.
In addition, Gasunie's new export contracts incorporate a lower level
of swing than older contracts, helping relieve pressure on delivery
capacity. However, as gas to gas competition increases in Europe, a
decline in delivery flexibility could cut the competitive advantage
held by Gasunie, warns WoodMac.

The new facilities will provide a solution for the company's gas
delivery capacity problems in the short to medium term and provide
extra flexibility in the longer term at a cost of about DFL2.5bn in
money of the day (mod). Their development has allowed a delay in
installation of extensive compression facilities at Groningen.
"However, this compression, which could cost around DFL4bn (mod), is
expected to be needed around the middle of the next decade in order to
meet future supply requirements and ultimately improve the recovery
factor of the field." WoodMac also notes provision of gas storage in
the Netherlands is a new area of opportunity for upstream companies to
expand their role downstream and add value to the gas they supply.

NOW TOTAL GAS DEAL CLOSE?

Total is reported to be close to signing a deal (possibly in
partnership with Spain's Repsol) to exploit the Tin Fouye Tabankort
(TFT) field in the Algerian Sahara, southeast of Hassi R'Mel, near the
border with Libya. The field is estimated to contain 144.6 Bcm of
natural gas, 15.6m tonnes (t) of gas which can be turned into LPG, and
16.6mt of condensates. This deal would be based on the same legislation
that made BP's contract at In Salah possible (see separate story).
Since gas is considered a national asset in Algeria, it took a special
law to allow Sonatrach to go into partnership with a foreign oil
company. As soon as the BP deal was signed, Algeria's oil minister
Ammar Makhloufi said it should serve as a model for other deals.

Algeria is keen to exploit its gas, which accounts for some 95% of its
export revenues. Indeed, the country plans to increase liftings from
some 30 Bcm in 1995 to 60 Bcm by 2000. That is why contracts are being
signed. At the same time, signings are proof the recent election
victory of President Liamine Zeroual has reassured western oil
companies Algeria will enjoy a sufficient measure of political
stability.

Elsewhere, Total has announced it plans to invest some 15% of new funds
in Asia, with a view to making 20% of its operating profits in the
area. Gas will figure prominently. In particular, the natural gas
liquefaction plant at Bontang in Borneo is to be extended with a
seventh and eighth liquefaction line. The oil company also plans to get
involved in building gas-fired electricity generating stations in the
region.

QATAR IN PHILIPPINES TALKS

Qatar is considering supplying LNG to First Gas Holdings Corp (FGHC) of
the Philippines, according to FGHC officials cited by Reuters. Qatar
energy and industry minister Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah met with
corporation officials on a visit to the Philippines, it said. First Gas
is a joint venture of First Philippine Holdings and British Gas and has
been planning gas fired power generation in the Philippines.

Meanwhile, Qatar hopes to sign a $680m loan with international banks in
March for offshore facilities for the Qatar Liquefied Gas Company
(Qatargas) LNG project, the country's first, according to an energy and
industry ministry official. The loan would be a mix of buyers credit
and commercial debt, covering 70% of the offshore portion of the
project, he told Reuters. Qatargas is to sell 4m tonnes (t)/yr of LNG
to Japan's Chubu Electric over 25 years from January 1997 and another
2mt/yr to seven other Japanese power and gas utilities for 25 years
from mid-1998.

A consortium of Japan's five major shipping firms is to invest Y250bn
($2.42bn) to build 10 tankers to ship Qatari LNG to Japan, economic
daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. The five are Nippon Yusen KK,
Mitsui OSK Lines, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, lino Kaiun Kaisha and Showa
Line. The tankers will ship 6mt/yr starting in 1997.

FIRMS PLAN AMMONIA PRODUCTION

Mozambique's state owned National Hydrocarbons Company has signed an
agreement with Canada's Scimitar Production and Zarara Petroleum
Resources of the United Arab Emirates to build an ammonia production
plant targeted at exports to Zimbabwe by end-1997, according to Maputo
daily Noticias. It quoted Mozambique deputy energy and mineral
resources minister Castigo Langa as saying the Zimbabwean market was
guaranteed and work would start "very soon".

The plant, expected to produce 100 tonnes/day of ammonia for export to
Zimbabwe, will use natural gas reserves in Buzi district southwest of
port city Beira. A pipeline will also be built from Buzi to Beira where
gas will generate electricity for the city. Zarara's Shukri Saleh
cautioned, however, that known Buzi gas reserves would support ammonia
production for only eight years. He urged Mozambique to start searching
for other gas reserves believed to exist in the area.

Mozambique towards end-1995 separately signed an agreement with Enron
Corp of the US for development of its Pande gasfield, targeted at
feeding markets in South Africa via a 1,300 km pipeline. Customers have

SOUTH AFRICA GROUP EYES MOSSGAS

South African chemical and synthetic fuel firms Sasol Ltd, AECI Ltd and
Sentrachem Ltd have set up a group to talk with the South African
government about buying the financially troubled Mossgas oil-from-
natural gas plant. The Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs lately
decided to seek a buyer (IGR 289/20). Mossgas has said that unless the
complex is sold it will have to be mothballed when current gas supplies
are finished in 1997 or new offshore fields must be exploited.

The government believes the $3bn plant could be sold for about $675m,
then turned into an oil refinery or a methanol producer. A recently
finished study found methanol production from it was feasible at
internationally competitive prices. The bidding group reckons its
methanol route would require only 25% of the gas needed to make
synthetic fuels.

MORE GAS SET FOR PETCHEMS

Egypt is prepared to supply more gas to Israel for use as a
petrochemical feedstock but the exact amount will depend on needs.
Potential customers had until end-December to provide the Israeli
energy ministry with estimates of their demand, following meetings
between Israeli and Egyptian officials. Earlier last year Israeli
energy minister Gonen Segev said he had received official confirmation
from Egyptian General Petroleum Corp, Agip and Amoco on supply of 2.5
Bcm/yr of Egyptian gas for 20 years (see also separate story). At that
time he said up to a fifth of the gas would be used for petrochemicals,
mainly ammonia. Israel has long been pressing for a supply of natural
gas from Egypt, notably for production of electricity. For some years
it has received a modest regular supply of Egyptian oil.

MAGHREB LINE WINS NEW CREDITS

The Maghreb-Europe natural gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain and
Portugal won two new credit lines before the New Year. First the
European Investment Bank conceded a Pta22.2bn ($187m) credit to Spain's
industrial gas operator Enagas to help finance the section that will
run from Tarifa on the southern coast into Portugal. Then Spain's
Instituto de Credito Offical (ICO) agreed a $200m credit to help
finance the section of the pipeline being built in Morocco. Enagas, 91%
owned by Gas Natural, is financing the Spanish section which will run
from Tarifa via Cordoba to Portugal through the Spanish regions of
Andalucia and Extremadura.

The guarantors of the loan are the Grupo Gas Natural, the European
Investment Fund and a banking syndicate. The Spanish stretch of the
pipeline will cost $400m of the total amount of $2.6bn The ICO credit
for Europe Maghreb Pipeline Ltd, jointly owned by Portugal's public
company Transgas and Spain's Sagane, will help finance the 540 km
section that runs from the Algeria-Morocco border to Moroccan
international water limits in the Strait of Gibraltar.

Meanwhile, oil, gas and chemical conglomerate Repsol - which owns 45.3%
of Gas Natural - has agreed to change the route of a local pipeline
which is to link two gasfields in the southwest province of Huelva to
the national network. The line would have passed through the Donana
national park, one of Europe's most important wetlands for migratory
birds. Repsol's announcement, which will mean extending the line by
nearly 30 km, followed protests from the park authorities and
ecologists.

PRICE HITCH FOR PIPELINE PLANS

Much trumpeted plans to pipe Qatar and Iran gas to Pakistan have run
into further trouble with the two countries demanding a higher price
for gas they plan to supply to Pakistan. This obstacle has been created
in the early stages of the project, sources close to the Pakistani
government said. An official of the petroleum and natural resources
ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said both Iran and Qatar
had come up with new demands for the gas price and expressed their
inability to sell at the previously agreed tariff. He said negotiations
between the three countries were, however, continuing.

Chaudrhy Nisar Ali Khan, former minister of petroleum and natural
resources in the government of Nawaz Sharif, said the Bhutto
administration had signed agreements for supply of gas from Iran, Qatar
and Turkmenistan which provided for completion of feasibility studies
in 12 months. But three months had elapsed and they were still not
complete. The question of gas tariff had also been sorted out at that

Sources close to the government said that besides the question of gas
tariff, there were other issues hampering implementation of memoranda
of understanding Pakistan signed with Iran and Qatar. However, they
declined to discuss them.

TWO BIDS FOR PAK-IRAN LINE

The Pakistani government has so far received two bids from
multinational oil companies for construction of the planned 1,700 km
Pak-Iran gas pipeline project for import of 1.6 Bcfd of gas from Iran.
The companies bidding include a consortium of four firms comprising
British Gas, Gaz de France, Shell International and Calgery of
Malaysia. The other bidder is Australia's BHP. Industry sources said
last date for submission of bids with proposals for import of gas from
Iran to Pakistan was 30 November, but on the request of bidders the
date was extended to 12 December, as they were busy finalising issues
among themselves.

Sources in the petroleum and natural resources ministry said BHP
submitted its bid on schedule - 30 November. Initially, the government
had issued letters of intent to six companies including Canada's Nova
Gas in September but that company pulled out of the project, while most
of the rest of the firms decided to establish a consortium. The
proposed Pak-Iran gas pipeline project would import 1.6 Bcfd of natural
gas at an estimated cost of $3.5bn. The 1,700 km pipeline is expected
to be completed by 2002.

Industry sources said bids would be opened in mid-January. The
successful company would be asked to start construction of the pipeline
by June 1996. The firm would also be responsible for operation and
maintenance and the project would be based on a build-own-operate
basis. The agreement package would include purchase of gas from Iran
and its delivery to Pakistan at an agreed point at a price consistent
with the price offered by other gas exporters such as Qatar and
Turkmenistan.

The Bhutto government is negotiating with Turkmenistan and Qatar for
import of a similar quantity of gas to meet growing demand in the
country. Discussion with the Turkmenistan government is in early
stages, industry sources said. But negotiations with Qatar authorities
have been delayed for more than a year due reportedly to a dispute
between the Qatari government and sponsor of the gas pipeline project,
Crescent Petroleum Co, which would be responsible for importing gas to
Pakistan, over the price for gas it will pay Qatar.

QATAR/TURKEY LNG DEAL 'CLOSE'

Qatar and Turkey will shortly sign a deal for a sales and purchase
agreement (SPA) on supply of 2m tonnes (t)/yr of Qatari LNG to Ankara,
according to a Qatari official. "We believe we can come to an
understanding shortly on 2m tonnes later," Jaber Al Marri, vice
chairman of state-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corp (QGPC) said. QGPC
and its joint venture partner Mobil Corp signed a preliminary
memorandum of understanding with Turkish pipeline company Botas in
January under which Turkey would buy an initial 2mt of Qatari LNG for
25 years.

EGYPT-ISRAEL ACCORD FLAGGED

A letter of intent vis a vis planned supplies of Egyptian gas to Israel
is likely to be signed this coming week, according to Israeli sources.
The document will define "late 1996 or early 1997" as deadline for
negotiations but will not refer to prices or quantities. Sources also
say Israel has virtually completed assessments of its gas needs, having
completed a survey of major potential consumers. Meanwhile, there has
been growing activity in Israel by groups interested in the project. On
18 December Israel's largest private fuel company Paz, announced a
cooperation agreement with Amoco, one of the companies with gasfields
in Egypt slated for the Israeli market. Paz is two-thirds owned by the
Liberman-Bino group and one third by Renaissance-Claridge and others.

Apart from being the largest gasoline retailer, it holds 35% of the
country's total LPG market and 40% of the residential LPG market
(600,00 households). Amoco's Cairo-based vice president (Mideast
natural gas) Tony Barrett said Paz and Amoco had "been exploring
opportunities in various segments of the natural gas industry -
including transmission, storage and distribution to the end markets".
Energy minister Gonen Segev has ruled out the possibility of any group
controlling both transmission and distribution of the gas, so the new
consortium will have to choose in which area it wishes to compete.

Paz board chairman Mordechai Ben Shach described Amoco's approach to
the gas project as "vertical" but added "we are waiting for a decision
by the state. Whatever tender we decide to bid for, the partnership
will be on a basis of equality, both regarding ownership and
investment". The Paz-Amoco deal caught most energy observers by
surprise as Amoco was expected to team up with a big company consortium
comprising the Mashav, Delek and Dankner groups with whom it had been
negotiating for more than a year.

However, leading Israeli business daily Globes reported subsequently
that - despite the Amoco-Paz deal-the consortium was still negotiating
with Amoco about involvement in setting up gas-fired power stations in
the region. And two days after the Paz-Amoco announcement, Enron's
executive in charge of negotiating an LNG deal with Israel, Rebecca
Mark, said the Mashav-Delek-Dankner group and Enron had a cooperation
agreement regarding import of LNG from Qatar. Together with Enron, the
consortium would invest in a $300m plant in Israel to gasify LNG.

Marks said that - for economic reasons-Enron would prefer the facility
to be located at Eilat or Aqaba rather than Ashkelon, the site
preferred by Israel's energy ministry. This would enable Jordan to
participate in the project and lower the gas price. Mark reportedly
said that "in principle" Enron preferred Eilat to Aqaba. If Aqaba was
chosen, an 8 km pipeline connection to Israel would be needed and Enron
would seek Jordanian partners for the gasification project. (Press
reports said negotiations with Enron were deadlocked because Israel
considered the price being asked for the LNG - more than $4/MMBtu - as
excessive).

Meanwhile, on 2 January Globes reported Gaz de France (GdF) was on the
verge of signing an agreement with the Mashav-Delek-Dankner group for
joint activity in the tenders relating to import of Egyptian gas. The
paper quoted unidentified energy sources as saying GdF's involvement
could be problematic because in 1994 a GdF-affiliated company,
Sofregaz, had carried out the feasibility study for the Egyptian gas
project on behalf of the Israeli energy ministry. The sources said the
issue would probably have to be decided by the government's legal
adviser. However, energy minister Segev "does not believe GdF's
participation in tenders will represent a problem", according to
Globes.

COST CUTS MAY FORCE MERGERS

Uncertainty over MTBE prices and the need to keep methanol production
costs in check (IGR 270/14) is forcing Sabic to take another look at
the structure of its industry. Now, in an attempt to cut administration
costs, the company is mulling the merger of two subsidiaries based in
al-Jubayl. If the plan goes ahead, methanol producers Ar-Razi and Ibn
Sina will merge, as will MTBE producers Ibn Zahr and Ibn Sina.

Unclear is whether Sabic intends to split Ibn Sina's methanol and MTBE
sides so as to form a single methanol producer and a single MTBE
manufacturer. Even larger cost savings should be possible if all three
firms come together. One problem facing Sabic, however, is the
ownership structure of the companies. Ar-Razi is 50% owned by a
Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical. Ibn Sina is 25%
owned by Hoechst Celanese with another 25% in the hands of Panhandle
Eastern.

Ibn Zahr is 10% owned by Neste, 10% by Ecofuel and 10% by Apicorp.
Sabic reckons it might be necessary to cut back on the foreign
shareholdings in order to effect mergers. That assumes a willingness to
co-operate on the part of the foreign partners. It also assumes Sabic
could do without the marketing expertise (and in some cases markets)
provided by those partners. Unitisation might provide the answer but
the mood in Saudi Arabia at present is not in favour of foreign
ownership in general.

SHIP CHARTER SLASHES COST

Oman LNG has scrapped plans to build dedicated LNG tankers for its
planned LNG-export scheme. That, says general manager Tony Hanna, will
cut overall costs from $6bn to $5bn. To handle the 3m tonnes/yr
intended for Korea Gas, chartered ships will be used instead. Detailed
terms for the 25-year contract are currently being negotiated, says
Hanna, but it is already decided that outside finance will be sought
for 70% of the cost. Oman LNG shareholders will put up 30% - $1.5bn -
in proportion to their holdings. That pans out at $765m from the Omani
government (51%); $510m from Shell (34%); $90m from Total (6%); $45m
each from Mitsui and Mitsubishi (3% each); $30m from Partex (2%); and
$15m from Itochu (1%).

PETRONAS DETAILS NEW LNG PLANT

Malaysia's third LNG plant, for which a deal was signed last month (IGR
289/33), will have two liquefaction trains of 3.4m tonnes (t)/yr
capacity each, boosting Malaysian LNG output to 22mt/yr. Mohamed Hassan
Marican, president and chief executive of Malaysian state oil and gas
firm Petronas, said gas from the new project was expected to be taken
up by traditional buyers Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and also new
markets like India, China and Thailand. Asia Pacific area LNG demand,
currently 56mt/yr, was forecast to rise to about 80mt/yr by 2005, he
said.

The new LNG plant at Bintulu, Sarawak will be owned 60% by Petronas and
10% each by US parented Occidental LNG (M), Japan's Nippon Oil Co,
Shell Gas BV and Sarawak state. Hassan gave no project cost but said a
guide was the 17bn ringgit ($6.7bn) investment in Malaysia's second LNG
plant. An initial deal between Petronas, Nippon and Oxy was reached in
1993 with Shell, already a major LNG player in Malaysia, invited in
later with Sarawak. The new plant will process gas from fields found by
Oxy, Petronas, Nippon and Shell offshore Sarawak.

At the same time as the LNG signing, Petronas (60%) signed a deal with
local firm Land & General Bhd and Japan's Mitsui and Co (20% each) for
a $300m, 0.4mt/yr capacity vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant targeted
at commercial production start by late 1998. Officials said Mitsui and
Land & General would spend another $100m to set up a separate polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) plant for which VCM is a feedstock. The two plants will
be at Kertih in Trengganu state which, Hassan said, Petronas aims to
turn into SE Asia's largest petrochemicals centre. He said a
"worldscale" 0.6mt/yr ethylene plant would be built at Kertih, while an
existing ethylene facility in the area would be expanded from 0.32mt/yr
capacity to 0.4mt/yr.

TENNECO WINS GASLINE LICENCE

Australia's Queensland state said it had granted a pipeline licence to
Tenneco Energy Australia Pty Ltd, part of US Tenneco Inc, to build a
750 km, 90 petajoules/yr capacity gasline between Ballera in southwest
Queensland and Wallumbilla, near Roma. Tenneco had indicated
construction work would start immediately targeted at operation of the
line by end-September 1996, state minerals and energy minister Tony
McGrady said. Tenneco was chosen as preferred developer in late 1994.
Construction of the line would mean gas markets in southeast and
central Queensland were assured of future access to plentiful gas
supplies as existing reserves around Roma were depleted, said McGrady.
The line's capacity was over double current east coast market demand,
he added.

YACHENG GAS FEEDS HONG KONG

China on 1 January started piping natural gas from the South China Sea
Yacheng 13-1 field offshore Hainan Island to Hong Kong under a 20 year
contract to feed power generation, according to officials of state
owned China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC). Owned 51% by CNOOC, 34.7%
by US parented Arco China and 14.3% by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum
Exploration Corp (Kufpec), the $1.2bn Yacheng 13-1 development has
annual production capacity of 3.4 Bcm and total reserves of about 82
Bcm, according to CNOOC.

Some 2.9 Bcm/yr shipped via a 790 km gasline will feed the Hong Kong
Black Point power plant of Castle Peak Power Corp, a 50/50 joint
venture of Hong Kong's China Light and Power and Exxon Corp of the US.
The remaining 0.5 Bcm/yr will feed power and chemicals plants on Hainan
Island via another 91 km gasline. According to Xinhua news agency,
Hainan plans to invest 10bn yuan ($1.2bn) to build three synthetic
ammonia and urea plants on the island in the next five years, fed by
natural gas.

Using some 2.2 Bcm/yr these plants would, on completion produce about
0.45m tonnes (t)/yr of synthetic ammonia and 0.78mt/yr of urea, said
Xinhua. Hainan also planned to build a methanol plant of 1mt/yr
capacity, a chemical works and acetylene salt chemical works. Annual
natural gas output in the area round Hainan was expected to reach some
10 Bcm by end-century and 21 Bcm by 2007, it said.

DABHOL D-DAY LOOMS - AGAIN

The fate of the Dabhol power generation project is likely to be decided
on 6 January. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi says a special
meeting of the state cabinet has been called that day to consider the
matter. Later, as IGR went to press, local reports quoted an unnamed
state minister as saying a revised deal had been approved by the state
and announcement was a formality. The state government has been pushed
into a decision before 15 January when arbitration proceedings at the
behest of the US project promoters Enron, Bechtel and GE are scheduled
to resume in London. The promoters had earlier agreed to postponement
of the proceedings until 10 December, the deadline set by Joshi for
decisive action (IGR 289/4).

But the opinion of senior state government officials to seek more
capital cost and tariff cuts than agreed with an experts committee
compelled him to pursue an apparently tough negotiating line. Extra
mileage gained in the negotiations can also yield electoral dividends
to the ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition which is keen
to rake up the corruption issue in coming elections against the main
rival Congress party whose government approved the Dabhol deal.

Sources say a compromise has been reached after Enron Development Corp
president Joseph Sutton conveyed to Joshi in late December that it
would not yield further on cost and tariff cuts. This provides for a
marginal reduction of tariff from the Rs1.89 ($0.054) levelised tariff
agreed earlier with the experts negotiating group. In return,
Maharashtra State Electricity Board will agree to lift power at more
than the 90% Plant Load Factor mentioned in the original Power Purchase
Agreement. This arrangement will keep intact the internal rate for
Dabhol Power Co.

panel authorities for development of the R-series of hydrocarbon fields
in the Bombay offshore. It has proposed peak output of 22,865 b/d of
oil based on an estimated 87.24m bbls of oil in a 22-year production
profile. R-series fields figure among the eight medium-sized and 33
small fields offered by the government in October 1993 for production

FIELD NARROWS FOR $700M PROJECT

Nineteen out of 34 international consortia vying for the $700m natural
gas utilisation scheme in Burma have made it to the shortlist of the
Rangoon regime. The list includes seven Japanese heavyweights like
Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, a South Korean league of Daewoo, Hyundai
and Samsung, and groups consisting of Total and Unocal, Bechtel, Norsk
Hydro, British Gas as well as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
and the Thai giant conglomerate Charoen Pokphand, according to sources
participating in the tender.

The bid calls for the rights to engage in the so-called "three-in-one"
project to utilise natural gas from Burma's known largest gasfield
Yadana, some 320 km south of Rangoon in the Gulf of Matarban. The
scheme involves construction of a 200 MW gas-fired power plant, a
570,000 tonnes (t)/yr urea fertiliser plant and a 250 km gasline to
transport Yadana gas ashore to the project site near the Burmese
capital.

Rangoon authorities have indicated to bidders they would be able to
announce a final decision on the choice of bidders in late January or
early February 1996. Due to magnitude of the scheme, the Burmese
government is expected to pick as many as five companies to undertake
work, rather than awarding the entire contract to just one company.

Industry sources clarified that Mitsui remains one of the contenders
though it may have provided some feasibility studies for the scheme to
Slorc last year (IGR 282/17). The three-in-one project will be based on
the 125 MMcfd of Yadana gas supply which the field production sharing
contractors including Total, Unocal Corp and PTT Exploration &
Production Plc (PTTEP) of Thailand will deliver to Rangoon under an
accord signed in February 1995 (IGR 269/21).

The majority of Yadana gas supply will be piped to Thailand under a 30-
year export contract concluded last February. The deal is for delivery
of 525 MMcfd of Yadana gas which will be used primarily for power
generation in Thailand. Yadana gas production is scheduled to start in
mid-1998.

UNIQUE/MITSUI CHASE MARKETS

Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Plc of Thailand and Japan's Mitsui & Co
will use their first joint venture on LPG and ammonia marketing in
Vietnam to spearhead into a wider range of energy-related businesses in
this socialist state. This strategic plan was outlined by senior
executives of the two firms specifically in a bid to capitalise on
extensive market opportunities in the country of 73m people.

That conforms with Unique Gas' target to expand its businesses in this
region and diversify its business lines beyond LPG and ammonia to
include other speciality gas, chemical and other products to become one
of Southeast Asia's leading chemical and energy concerns. Earlier last
year, Unique Gas formed a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil firm
Petronas to develop a network of service stations in Thailand offering
a full range of petroleum products under the Petronas brand name.

For Mitsui, the joint venture with Unique Gas in Vietnam forms an
integral part of its expansion of its businesses there where it has
been active in marketing fertiliser, among other areas. Unique Gas and
Petrochemicals (Vietnam) Co, equally owned by Unique Gas and Mitsui
group, early in December opened its $5.02m LPG and anhydrous ammonia
terminal in Long Thanh district of Dong Nai province, about 70 km south
of Ho Chi Minh City.

The terminal serves as platform for the joint venture to launch its LPG
and ammonia marketing in Vietnam where demand for those products is
expanding dramatically. Unique Gas president Phaibul Chalermsaphayakorn
and Mitsui & Co (Thailand)'s Hiroyuki Maruko said they were convinced
about "bright" economic growth potential.

Maruko said Unique Gas and Mitsui would broaden product lines in
Vietnam to include products like fuel oil in the near future. However,
execution of such a project was very much subject to Vietnamese
authorities' approval, a difficult and time consuming process, he said.
In spite of that, Mitsui, on its own part, will start looking into the
viability of setting up what would be the first LPG cylinder production
plant in Vietnam.

It has also been eyeing opportunities for establishing a natural gas
separation plant in Vietnam to process indigenous natural gas produced
from oil and gas fields off the country's southern coast, he added. For
Unique Gas, Phaibul noted the company has been assessing the
possibilities of establishing businesses including LPG distribution in
neighbouring countries, particularly Burma.

Established n 1982, Unique Gas has been active in distribution of LPG
and ammonia in Thailand. Vietnam is the first foreign country where
Unique Gas has an investment. The Unique Gas and Mitsui alliance in
Vietnam has had a firm plan to enlarge its operations in the country in
line with the expected dramatic jump in consumption of LPG. Phaibul
announced the joint venture plans to inject some $2m in additional
capital to boost the LPG storage capacity of its Long Thanh terminal
from the current level of 400 tons by 200 tons in February 1996 and
another 400 tons in 1997, so that at end-1997 combined capacity will be
1,000 tons.

Unique Gas Vietnam targets industrial users, especially those located
in Go Dau industrial zone where its terminal is situated, as its main
clientele for LPG, accounting for roughly 60% of its expected sales
volume of some 6,000 tons in 1996. The remaining 40% would be sales to
residential and commercial sectors in the form of cylinders. Unique Gas
Vietnam general director John Lu said total LPG and ammonia demand in
Vietnam was expected to more than double by 2000 and the company hoped
to grow with the market.

An industry estimate puts present LPG demand in Vietnam in the range of
4,000-5,000 tons a month. The Thai-Japanese joint venture expects to
capture a 10-15% share in Vietnam's LPG market currently dominated by
local suppliers like Saigon Petro, Elf Gas and Petrolimex - all with
local government participation.

Initial LPG supplies to Unique Gas Vietnam are from Thailand, Malaysia
and Indonesia. There is no local production of LPG in Vietnam. Unique
Gas Vietnam is the first wholly-owned foreign venture in LPG and
ammonia business to be licensed by the Vietnamese authorities. The
company's terminal covers an area of 111,000 sq metres; only a fraction
has been utilised. In Thailand, Unique Gas operates two LPG/ammonia
terminals in Bang Pakong and Surat Thani, two LPG tankers, 55 LPG road
tank trucks and 63 LPG bottling plants.

PTT MULLS HIGHER BURMA TAKE

Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is considering raising its
purchase of natural gas from Burma's offshore Yadana field by 200-300
MMcfd over agreed contractual levels. PTT governor Pala Sookawesh spoke
of the possibility since the Yadana field developing group expects
higher gas productivity from the field and in light of additional gas
demand spurred by private power plant operators in Thailand under the
independent power producer (IPP) and small power producer (SPP)
programmes. He said recent information obtained from Yadana operator
Total indicated the field, some 320 km south of Rangoon in the Gulf of
Matarban, could prove additional gas reserves and deliverability.

According to PTT, Yadana's present certified recoverable gas reserves
are put at 5.7 Tcf. The 30-year contract PTT concluded with the Yadana
developing group in February 1995 calls for initial gas delivery of 141
MMcfd in mid-1998 before building up to 525 MMcfd 14 months later (IGR
268/16). Total executives have said earlier that Yadana is quite
productive and does not require Total to drill as many wells as
expected. Only some 10-15 wells would be needed in the initial stage to
achieve the contractual production level of some 500 MMcfd (IGR
270/18). Meanwhile, Pala said he had received assurance from parties
concerned that production and delivery of Yadana gas to PTT would start
within the contractual date.

Lately, Burmese ministers have also assured the PTT governor the
problem of most concern to PTT and the Yadana developing group - laying
of part of the gasline over areas in southeastern Burma where ethnic
Karen and Mon guerrillas have been waging war against the Rangoon
forces - would no longer pose a threat. They reportedly said the
southern part of the area holding most of the onshore section to the
Thai western province of Kanchanaburi was now controlled by ethnic Mons
allied with the Rangoon regime. The only problem at the border was the
minority Christian Karens who still dominated the area north of the
gasline route, though their Bhuddist faction had defected to the
government's Slorc. Pala said work related to the Yadana gas project on
the Burmese side, including the $1bn field development and the 300-plus
km off/onshore gasline was well under way.

CAMBODIA MULLS PTT MODEL

Cambodia has started considering establishment of a state oil firm to
manage its indigenous petroleum resources, particularly offshore
natural gas, which could be discovered and developed in future. Pou
Sotirak, Cambodian industry, mines and energy minister, said the
government had accepted it was the right time for the country to have a
"national" oil firm, possibly similar to those created in neighbouring
Asean states such as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT). He
indicated the starting point would be when the country discovered
"practical" size resources, perhaps of Thailand's scale. "If we don't
have any reserves, then there is no need for a national oil company,"
he added.

Sotirak said he was "still thinking very hard" about the role of the
proposed national oil body. But generally Cambodia wanted to optimise
its economic exploitation of natural gas and petroleum, if it had any.
"It must serve the benefits of the public and the government." He said
he had asked PTT governor Pala Sookawesh if PTT could "teach a few
tricks" on establishing a national oil firm and developing personnel to
run the organisation.

"Right now we are still searching for petroleum (offshore); if we
discovered something I have to quickly visit Mr Pala to learn to
establish a national oil firm," he added. Cambodia has high hopes of
finding substantial natural gas reserves at locations near the so-
called overlapping areas of Thai-Cambodian territorial claims in the
Gulf of Thailand, given the fact Unocal Thailand has been producing gas
and condensate from the general area. Bangkok and Phnom Penh are still
unable to resolve their disputes over the offshore territorial claims,
said to be highly gas prospective.

Phnom Penh has mooted the idea that Thailand and Cambodia adopt a
"Joint Development Area (JDA)", as Thailand Malaysia have done, in
resolving the disputes in the southernmost part of the Gulf of
Thailand. Thailand has not accepted this, insisting on its claims on
the overlapping tract covering tens of thousands of square kilometres
(IGR 285/21).

HONDO WARNS GASLINE IN DOUBT

Hondo Oil & Gas Co this week warned completion of a Colombian natural
gas pipeline it plans with Amoco of the US is now in doubt because of
changes in Colombian regulations on pipeline tariffs and natural gas
prices. It also said the planned Opon 5 development well in the country
had been delayed indefinitely because of right of way disputes with
landowners. Hondo cited adoption of new regulations by recently formed
government agency Comision de Regulacion de Energia y Gas, part of the
mines and energy ministry.

It said the regulations set a ceiling price for natural gas and a
maximum 12.5% rate of return (before Colombian taxes) for pipeline
tariffs. The ceiling had been interpreted to include costs or fees for
natural gas processing, so that process costs could not be passed on to
buyers. "These new regulations will reduce the amount the company
expects to receive for natural gas and pipeline tariffs in the future,"
said a Hondo statement.

Earlier, Hondo said the new regulations affected terms agreed in a
memorandum of understanding announced last summer with Colombian state
oil and gas firm Ecopetrol for construction of an 88 km pipeline from
the Opon Association Contract (OPC) area to Ecopetrol's refinery at
Barancabermeja. This called for recovery of pipeline investment via a
tariff. Negotiations were continuing with Ecopetrol on relief from the
regulations' effects and meantime pipeline work was continuing, said
Hondo. Plans for 1996 OPC area exploration and development projects
would be reconsidered during the first quarter.

NEB DETAILS EXPORTS IMPACT

Total volumes of Canadian gas to be exported under long term contracts
up to 2014 represent 11% of remaining and undiscovered western Canada
reserves, according to the National Energy Board (NEB). Known and yet
to be found reserves totalled an estimated 164 Tcf at 1 November 1995
of which 63 Tcf was remaining reserves and 101 Tcf undiscovered, said
the board. Authorised volumes under long term contract totalled 18.2
Tcf. The volume did not include licences for gas exports from the
Mackenzie Delta totalling 9.2 Tcf. NEB said volumes authorised for long
term export to the USA included 40% to the northeast, 32% to the
midwest, 15% to California and 13% to the Pacific northwest.

HANSON SELLS SUBURBAN PROPANE

Industrial conglomerate Hanson has announced plans to sell a majority
equity stake in Suburban Propane, third biggest retail propane
distributor in the USA, through a public offer. Hanson expects to raise
about #500m ($776.3m) through the offer and a related debt issue. The
public offer will represent about 62% of equity in a new 'master
limited partnership' dubbed Suburban Propane Partners LP. Suburban will
also issue $425m of senior debt maturing in 2002-2011. Hanson will keep
an approximate 38% combined subordinated and general partnership
interest in the new MLP, it said.

The structure would enhance Suburban's ability to expand by using
partnership units to acquire other propane distributors. Suburban is
third largest retail and wholesale distributor of propane gas in the US
for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses. Its
retail operations are run through 353 sales and service centres serving
nearly 0.8m customers in 39 states. Suburban has about 6% of the US
retail propane market, said Hanson. A substantial slice of net proceeds
from the unit offering and debt issue would be used to make payments to
Hanson subsidiaries.

FLYING START FOR MARITIMES LINE

A recent open season for Phase I of the planned Maritimes & Northeast
Pipeline project resulted in nominations for over 410 MMcfd of natural
gas transportation services, according to lSource Development Co, a
unit of Panhandle Eastern Corp, one of the line sponsors, early last
month. With announced initial capacity on Phase I just 60 MMcfd,
nominations far exceeded expectations, said 1Source. Phase 1, due to
start transportation services in 1997, comprises 63 miles of 24-inch
gasline linking Dracut, Massachusetts with Wells, Maine. Other sponsors
of the project to market natural gas from the Sable Island area
offshore Nova Scotia are Westcoast Energy Inc, Mobil Corp, Shell Canada
and Eastern Enterprises.

1Source said the open season response demonstrated the strong demand
for natural gas service in Maine and New Hampshire and the variety of
shippers nominating was evidence of a rapidly emerging, competitive
natgas marketplace there. "This is good news for the Maritimes &
Northeast project as a whole since Phase I is the project's gateway to
major markets in the eastern United States," said lSource. For Phase I
sponsors will now look to seal binding precedent agreements with future
Maritimes & Northeast customers, with federal approval to proceed
expected to be sought this month.

1Source said sponsors were keen to move ahead on Phase II for which it
expected the response in Maine and the Maritimes to be as encouraging.
The overall project will eventually involve construction of a 630 mile
underground pipeline crossing areas in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick in
Canada, Maine and New Hampshire before interconnecting with the North
American pipe grid in Massachusetts. Scheduled pipeline capacity is 400
MMcfd with service due to start in November 1999. Sable Offshore Energy
Project companies are Mobil, Shell Canada, Petro-Canada Inc, Imperial
Oil and Nova Scotia Resources Inc. They aim to tap about 3 Tcf of
recoverable natural gas from six fields in the Sable Island area.

CORPOVEN PLANS NGLS LEAP

State owned PDVSA unit Corpoven says it plans to boost natural gas
liquids (NGLs) output by some 160% over the next 10 years with output
expected to reach 6.22 Bcf in 2005 from 2.36 Bcf currently. It said the
forecast was based on "large proven reserves of natural gas" in
Venezuela totalling 138 Tcf of which Corpoven held 62%. The company
planned to invest 262bn bolivars ($771.6m) in various projects to boost
NGLs output. Main project was the Eastern Cryogenic Complex, or Accro,
in eastern Monagas state.

Its latest component, a $300m cryogenic plant, was inaugurated at Santa
Barbara last November. Third and final phase is due complete in 2004.
Accro output was expected to reach 290,000 b/d of NGLs by 2005 against
82,000 b/d now. Up to 30% of Venezuelan gas liquids are exported,
mainly to the USA. Corpoven estimates market capacity in the Americas
at about 150,000 b/d.

SHV CALOR EXPANDS IN BRAZIL

The international LPG joint venture of Calor Group of the UK and Dutch
SHV Energy is spending $62m for a 49% stake (with 50% voting rights) in
Supergasbras Distribuidora de Gas, Brazil's fourth largest LPG
distributor. The two partners in SHV Calor Brasil are investing $31m
each. The deal follows acquisition last August of a majority stake in
Minasgas, Brazil's fifth largest bottled gas supplier. Calor said the
two firms would be operated as separate companies but it would
encourage the rival suppliers to make cooperation arrangements for the
future. The two supply a combined total of 1.35m tonnes/yr of LPG to
over 40m people.

Last summer Calor unveiled plans to spend about #70m ($108.7m) on
projects in Asia and Latin America, in conjunction with SHV which has a
controlling stake in Calor, seeking to reduce its dependence on the UK
LPG market. Calor financial controller John Taylor this week said the
group had about #40m to spend on other projects, mostly in Asia.

CPUC SEEKS POWER COMPETITION

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is back in the
precedent-setting business with a late December move to bring
competition to all electric power sales in the Golden State. The broad
deregulation plan, a refinement and stretch-out of the pioneering free-
market initiative launched by the commission last April, will affect
virtually every aspect of the $20bn California electricity market. In
the process, it may be the beginning of the end for CPUC itself, at
least as presently constituted. And, like so many other things
Californian, it is likely to serve as a bellwether for other state
commissions seeking a roadmap to successful deregulation of their own
electric utilities.

For gas interests, the CPUC move is expected to result, at least
eventually, in a further proliferation of small-scale, independent
power production facilities, most of which are likely to be fired by
natural gas. "Market mechanisms", said CPUC, will be used "to minimise
transition costs [and] utilities will be allowed the opportunity for
full recovery of the transition costs associated with existing power
contracts and prior regulatory commitments".

The commission added it would also permit "accelerated recovery of net
book value of undepreciated assets combined with a reduced cost of
capital". However, the new plan was approved on a sharply divided 3-2
vote of the commissioners, signalling lengthy fights before
deregulation in California becomes a fait accompli. And the plan must
receive concurrence from California Governor Pete Wilson and from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc).

Timing of the transition to open markets remains ambitious:
deregulation would begin in less than two years, on 1 January 1998,
continuing through the first day of 2003 when power markets would
become completely open. In a repeat of part of its original proposal
that resulted in extensive criticism from various energy industry
sectors, the new CPUC plan includes preferences for "renewable" fuels
and penalties for failure to achieve minimum purchase requirements for
power generated using environmentally benign technologies.

The new regulatory regime would also use "performance-based" criteria
to spur operational efficiency at the state's utilities. CPUC said it
would strive during first-quarter 1996 to achieve a "California
Consensus" among state and local officials and electricity customers.
The commission pledged to submit the envisaged consensus to Ferc in
what it termed "a spirit of cooperative federalism", and what cynics
suggested was an end run to co-opt the Washington regulators.

Rather than phasing the deregulation plan in by customer classes, the
new CPUC plan would select a "representative" group from all customers
for participation in the first phase two years hence. That initial move
into uncharted waters would last just one year, during which selected
customers could shop around among electricity providers for the best
deals. After that, full open market conditions would be implemented.

State regulation of rates and services would continue in instances
where true competition did not occur, said CPUC, although traditional
cost-of-service standards would be supplanted by overall performance
criteria. In the CPUC view, that would lead to increased profit
potential for the most efficient producers and investor penalties for
those who failed to cut costs sufficiently.

To assure open transmission access for all power producers, the CPUC
system would establish an "independent system operator" (ISO) to assume
control of utility-owned transmission assets and manage the use of
those resources. The ISO would also be responsible for assuring
adequate power supplies and reliability of transmission facilities, as
well as fixing any problems that develop. In short, major utilities
could continue to own transmission properties but could not operate
them independently of the ISO.

In an element likely to be among its most controversial, the CPUC plan
would require California's Big Three electric utilities - Pacific Gas
and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and
Electric - to divest half their fossil-fired generation facilities if
they wish to avoid "market power" accusations. Another "politically
correct" aspect of the CPUC decision would require a "public goods
charge" on retail electricity sales, with proceeds to be used to fund
energy conservation and efficiency initiatives "not provided by the
competitive market that are in the broader public interest".

CPUC also mandated that electric rates include a "competition
transition charge" that could not be bypassed in sales transactions.
That charge would be collected from all power consumers, whether they
receive conventional bundled service from utilities or buy power
directly from independent producers. As the dust began to settle on the
CPUC announcement, gas industry analysts were hedging their bets on
exactly what the impact might be on gas use.

However, most observers concurred that if the plan is endorsed by the
governor and by Ferc, the increased access of independent generators
would inevitably favour greater gas use in California. If other states
choose to copy California once more, the consensus is that gas use for
power generation could increase substantially, with few observers
willing to speculate on precise growth figures.

COLD SPARKS PRICE SPIKE

Abnormally cold weather in the eastern half of the US, combined with a
perception among traders that gas storage inventories are declining
rapidly enough to raise questions about sufficiency of gas supplies
through the 31 March end of the winter heating season, produced an
unprecedented upward spike in gas futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange during the week before Christmas, with high prices
for the January futures contract climbing close to $4/MMBtu in daily
trading before settling back into the $3.00 range for the week.

The abrupt jump also marked the highest gas futures prices on the Nymex
since trading in those instruments began. As the New Year's holiday
weekend began, gas futures contracts were trading back in the $2.50
range. Traders appeared more worried this season about the "early" cold
snaps that have occurred in the eastern US. While periods of
exceptionally cold weather in the last several years have often been
colder and more prolonged than those in recent days, they occurred
closer to the end of the winter season, when concerns about the season-
long adequacy of gas supplies were less severe.

Questions along the lines of "can we make it until April?" have
occurred with increasing frequency. For the week ending 22 December,
the American Gas Association reported gas in storage totalled 2,257
Bcf, or 70% "full". For the same reporting period last year, storage
volumes were nearly 400 Bcf higher, and inventories stood at 83% full.
Spot wellhead gas prices rose by 25 cents/MMBtu to $2.30 during the
week before Christmas, closing at 83 cents more than the year-earlier
week. For the week between Christmas and New Year, prices rose another
29 cents to $2.59, closing at $1.15/MMBtu above the year-end week of
1994. Meanwhile, figures for average spot wellhead prices for full year
1995 came out at $1.45/MMBtu.

The dramatic increases in gas futures prices during the year's last
fortnight gave rise to a formal complaint filed by an ad-hoc group
calling itself "the Nymex floor members", seeking an investigation by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the volatile fluctuations
in gas futures contract prices just before the end of the year. The
leap of 94.4 cents/MMBtu registered by the January gas futures contract
between 18 December and the closing of the January contract on 21
December brought the contract price to $3.448/MMBtu, a record for the
contract. Representatives of Nymex insisted the price volatility was a
natural result of exceptionally strong gas demand, rather than any
mismanagement or wrongdoing on the part of the exchange or individual
traders.

NEW PIPE TALLY 8,000 MILES

More than 8,000 miles of new US natural gas transmission line or
pipeline looping have been built, are under construction or are
proposed, according to the American Gas Association (AGA) in its latest
annual report on new construction. Additionally, AGA lists 47 proposed
natural gas storage projects in various stages of development to add
more than 500 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and, if built,
increase total US working gas storage capacity by nearly 20%.

Through 1993 and 1994, more than $9bn of new gas pipeline construction
projects were in various stages of development. AGA classifies these
projects as either built in 1993 or 1994 and operational, or currently
under construction, proposed and pending. In aggregate, the projects
total 8,087 miles of new line and looping, 1,098,940 hp of additional
compression, and 15.3 Bcfd of additional capacity. The existing US gas
transmission network consists of more than 2,984,500 miles of line and
more than 14m hp of compression with a total book value of nearly
$54bn.

ENGINE IN SCHOOL BUS EXAM

Engineers at South-western Research Institute, San Antonio are
developing an electronically controlled natural gas engine for school
and commercial buses. Based on an existing PowerTech Deere natural gas
engine, it is part of an Energy Department-funded project to build safe
school buses powered by natural gas. The modified 8.1 litre engine has
electronic fuel injection, an electronic drive-by-wire throttle
actuator, an electronically controlled wastegate and a direct-fire,
coil-on-plug ignition system.

So far, it is said to have demonstrated low emission levels with better
performance and fuel efficiency than any heavy-duty, natural gas engine
commercially available. Deere plans to produce a commercial version of
this engine this year. The engine is currently undergoing lean-misfire
and knock-limit tests to determine operating limits. Researchers are
also identifying the influence of various engine components on
performance and emissions with the goal of lowering nitrogen oxide
output while maintaining engine efficiency.

During the next several months, they will evaluate different control
strategies for keeping the desired air-fuel ratio, spark timing, boost
pressure and other parameters during steady-state and transient
operation. They are also developing systems for knock and misfire
detection and catalyst efficiency monitoring. Once proven, the engine
will go into a prototype, ultrasafe bus being designed by Blue Bird
Corp. Natural gas will be stored in four composite-wrapped aluminium
cylinders located within the frame rails underneath the bus which is
expected to have a range of more than 300 miles. Besides sporting a new
engine, the ultrasafe bus will be lighter weight for optimum fuel
efficiency.

ELTRON IN NEW SYNGAS R&D

Eltron Research Inc is developing a 'ceramic membrane reactor' (CMR)
technology for electrochemical conversion of humidified natural gas to
synthesis gas. In addition to the yield being up to 90% in a single
pass, the reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous and therefore
requires no externally imposed voltage. Further, it needs no external
source of pure oxygen, cutting production costs by 30-50%, says project
manager Michael Schwartz. Maintained at some 900oC, the CMR is equipped
with a tubular mixed-conducting membrane with methane held inside and
the air (for O2) outside.

The methane side of the membrane is coated with a partial-oxidation
catalyst, while the outer side contains a reduction catalyst. The high
conductivity of the membrane materials for electrons and oxygen ions
permits the reaction of oxygen with methane while preventing direct
contact between methane and oxygen. In addition, oxygen becomes
separated from atmospheric nitrogen via the membrane. Eltron is seeking
partners to build a largescale CMR prototype.

BUYERS TO HOOK INTO US SYSTEM

Late this year, Mexico's PMI Trading Co hopes to take delivery of the
first NGLs shipped through newly-formed Rio Grande Pipeline Co. The
latter is a new joint venture formed by Mid-America Pipeline, Amoco
Pipelines and Navajo Pipeline companies to link the US NGL grid to its
southern neighbour. Liquids will originate at Hobbs Station, Texas and
other points on Mid-America Pipeline's 16,000 km system to the Pemex
Gas y Petroquimica Basica Mendez terminal in Ciudad Juarez.

To achieve this, Rio Grande is buying Navajo's existing 8-inch pipeline
from Odessa, Texas to a point near El Paso. A new 8-inch line will link
this point to the Mendez terminal in Mexico. Mid-America will be
operator of the system. Volume to be moved has yet to be announced.

NEW INDIANA PLANT ON STREAM

PSI Energy and Destec Energy have begun commercial operations at their
joint venture coal gasification plant at West Terre Haute in Indiana.
The Wabash River plant has taken two years to build and will convert
2,7000 tonnes/day of high-sulphur coal - supplied from Peabody Coal's
Hawthorn mine in the state - to an ultimate 262,000 kW of electricity.
The latter will stem from PSI's existing Wabash River coal-fired plant,
being converted to a syngas-fired combined-cycle unit. Destec
technology is being used throughout. In the gasification plant, the
company claims to remove 98% of the coal's sulphur content prior to
gasification.

That seems set to be sold for use in fertiliser production. Air
pollution is said to be just a fraction of the limit set for 2000 by
the Clean Air Act. Acid rain pollutants are also said to be reduced
significantly. A further by-product is ash derived from the
gasification plant. This is converted to an inert vitrous aggregate
said to be ideal for road building. Now Destec aims to use the same
technology to use unsaleable residues from refineries as basic fuel for
gasification.

CMS BUYS PETAL STORAGE

CMS Gas Transmission and Storage Co has bought Chevron's Petal Gas
Storage Co for an undisclosed sum. As part of the sale agreement,
Chevron will continue to receive long-term storage service from Petal,
which owns a high-deliverability peak-shaving storage unit in Forrest
County, Mississippi. With a capacity of 3.2 Bcf, the salt-dome cavern
provides up to 320 MMcfd delivery for up to 10 days and can be refilled
in 20 days. At present it is connected to two interstate pipelines -
Tennessee Gas and Koch Gateway.

Access to other pipelines is being mulled by CMS, along with the
possibility of expansion. "We believe Petal's high-flexible peaking
type of service is what the market wants," says William Haener,
president at CMS Gas Transmission & Storage. The company complements
CMS' existing storage business and will allow the latter to tailor
specific services to satisfy a wide variety of customer needs, he adds.

BECHTEL LANDS LNG EPC CONTRACT

Atlantic LNG Co of Trinidad and Tobago has taken two major decisions
which will ensure it maintains its deadline for delivering LNG to its
two customers, Cabot and Enagas, by first-quarter 1999. One is choice
of the Phillips optimised cascade system, developed by Phillips
Petroleum Co, as the preferred liquefaction process for the 425 MMcfd
plant. Overseas Bechtel, one of three companies asked to submit front
end engineering design for the plant, based its proposals on the
Phillips process and has been awarded the engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) contract.

Negotiations on an overall contract price will begin with Bechtel in
January, led by Atlantic's recently-appointed vice president for
engineering and construction, David Jamieson. Ground should be broken
for construction early in the second quarter. The other major decision
is to break that ground elsewhere than at La Brea, the site in
southwest Trinidad originally chosen for LNG, mainly on the insistence
of the last government, which wanted to develop the area.

But the abandoned wells left behind from discontinued oil and gas
operations could not be cleaned up in time and the existence of the
nearby Pitch Lake meant the area would remain inherently unstable
geologically. The LNG site has been shifted five miles further down the
southwest coast to Point Fortin, where ample reclaimed land and good
harbour facilities, which have accommodated oil tankers for decades,
are available.

The move will also help provide alternative jobs for workers made
redundant by closure of Petrotrin's Point Fortin refinery, which is
imminent because no one seems interested in buying it. Bechtel beat two
other contenders to the prize contract, likely to be worth close to
$1bn. Chiyoda Corp/Hudson Engineering had offered an LNG design based
on the Air Products and Chemicals liquefaction process and a joint
venture of MW Kellogg and JGC Corp also submitted a bid.

Atlantic believes its strategy of inviting engineering designs first
and then awarding an EPC contract was the best way to control project
costs. As David Wight, president of Amoco Trinidad, whose associate
company, Amoco Trinidad LNG, owns 34% of Atlantic, says: "We now have a
good idea of what our costs are going to be and can control them."

GASLINE PLANS 'MAKE PROGRESS'

Negotiations on the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline continue apace and
according to a consultant close to the action there has been concrete
progress "with all technical and planning aspects in place". He was
referring to the pipeline being built in two Brazilian sections, with
completion of the Corumba-Sao Paulo section before that from Sao Paulo
to Port Alegre instead of simultaneously. The pipeline diameter has
been fixed at 32 inches (instead of 28 inches) permitting a maximum
volume of 30 MMcmd rather than 16 MMcmd.

The source said: "There are no problems with existing legislation for
the pipeline to go ahead; all that is really needed is long term
distribution contracts with utilities. All the partners (Enron, YPFB,
Petrobras, British Gas, Tenneco and BHP) are basically in agreement."
Asked about the pipeline's timetable, the consultant put a dateline of
mid-1996 for all existing problems to be overcome and a "very
conservative and cautious maximum timescale for contracts for gas power
projects to be signed and capable of seeking finance by April 1997".

One major reason for cheerfulness for the companies involved in the
gasline project was a decision by Brazil's federal electricity holding
Eletrobras to include gas-fired power for the very first time in its
revised long-term plan (1996-2004) to be published this January. Enron
has always argued the Bolivian pipeline must be primed by electricity
generating projects from day one of operation so that it is producing
money from the start while industrial and residential markets are
developed.

The Eletrobras plan for gas-fuelled generation consists of 1,800 MW in
the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, 450 MW in Mato Grosso and
390 MW in Mato Grosso do Sul. The Bolivia pipeline will enter Brazil at
Mato Grosso do Sul (Corumba) and go straight to the contiguous state of
Sao Paulo where the main market is. Sao Paulo currently takes gas from
Rio de Janeiro state but when Bolivian gas arrives this flow is planned
to be reversed.

A branch pipeline will probably leave the Bolivia-Brazil main pipeline
within Bolivia (between Santa Cruz de la Serra and Puerto Suarez) in
order to serve Mato Grosso state, probably entering Brazilian territory
at the river port of Caceres. Enron is understood to have signed
protocols of understanding for establishing gas-fired power stations
with the state electricity companies of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do
Sul.

There are apparently two issues still to be resolved. One is the
question of the gas price to distribution companies. Negotiations are
centred on the equation of volume and prices. The pipeline project
companies have been arguing for high volumes and lower prices while
distribution company estimates of demand have tended to be conservative
and consequently the price offered has tended to rise. The use of gas
in power stations will go some way to breaking this particular log-jam
by raising initial throughput and lowering the price.

Another problem, aired for some time, has been the allegation that
Bolivian reserves will be insufficient for the projected gasline flows.
Opponents of the gas pipeline say the certified reserves (by
Netherlands, Sweel and Associates of Dallas) do not cover the estimated
100 Bcm Brazil would consume over the 20 year contract period. The
respected Dallas company put Bolivian reserves at 80.8 Bcm proven; 30
Bcm probable and 25.9 Bcm possible. The consultant was confident this
problem "could be settled fairly quickly", without specifying how.

GAS VEHICLE PRODUCTION OK'D

Brazil's mines and energy minister Raimundo Brito has authorised the
motor industry to start production of natural gas fuelled cars and
trucks. Until now only buses have been purpose-built to use gas while
taxis could be converted to the fuel. Ministry officials expect the
cars will be produced with the option of alcohol use in order to
increase their range outside major cities. One of the reasons given for
allowing gas-fuelled car production is the increasing levels of
pollution in the two Brazilian cities with developed natural gas road
vehicle infrastructure: Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

US INVOLVEMENT NOW LIKELY

One at least of the new ammonia/urea complexes planned for location at
Jose in Antzotegui state Venezuela is set for US participation (IGR
287/25). Pequiven has signed a letter of intent with Arcadian to
jointly study feasibility of a $700m project involving a 700,000
tonnes/yr (t/yr) urea plant, fed by twin 600,000 t/yr ammonia units.
Assuming the study is positive and finance can be secured, Arcadian
sees a construction period running to three years. The move, says
Arcadian president Doug Campbell, would allow the company to move into
the fast-growing Latin American market for agriculture fertilisers,
with Venezuela's hefty gas reserves making that country a natural place
from which to operate.

CRISTOBAL NEEDS HIGHER PRICE

Partners in Sucre Gas SA, the joint venture backing the planned
Cristobal-Colon LNG export project, will wait until late 1996 before
committing themselves to a go-ahead. So says Ronald Pantin, planning
chief at Petroven, whose Lagoven subsidiary holds 33% of Sucre. For the
project to be economically viable, says Pantin, prices in the US will
have to be $2.50/MMBtu, while those in Europe will have to hit
$3.50/MMBtu. On recent forecasts (IGR 288/18), pipeline gas from almost
any source will undercut the European price suggested, US prices may
well top the $2.50/MMBtu level by end-century (IGR 285/30) but the
spate of new gas being released by the price-rise-inspired exploration
hike puts some doubt on higher prices lasting for long.

DEMAND FOR CANADIAN NATURAL GAS

Canada -  Demand for Canadian natural gas, including exports, will
require aggressive drilling programmes for the next 15 years, Canada's
National Energy Board (NEB) predicts.

In a supply/demand study covering 1993-2010 it says operators have
found about 3.5 Tcf/yr since 1987. But that is 1 Tcf less than the
volume needed to keep reserves from declining.

It forecasts Canadian gas production will increase from a current 4.5
Tcf/yr to more than 6 Tcf/yr by 2005. On the price side, it projected
prices rising to about $4/Mcf by 2010, or $2.50/Mcf after adjustment
for inflation.

THAI LPG PROJECT

Thailand - Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) recently awarded a
$2.02m contract to Foster Wheeler International Corp of the UK to
provide engineering consultancy services for LPG and oil depot
projects.

The LPG project involves a $22m investment to expand storage capacity
at PTT's Khao Bor Ya terminal in Chon Buri, about 100 km east of
Bangkok, by 5,000 tons.

Installation of three additional LPG spheres and related loading and
unloading facilities as part of the expansion of Khao Bor Ya terminal
is expected complete by 1997.

The expansion facilitates a significant increase of LPG throughput
volume at the terminal, resulting from a substantial rise in locally-
produced LPG and the need to export surplus LPG which is expected to be
453,000 tons.

START-UP OF NORSK HYDRO'S PORSGRUNN COMPLEX

Norway - Following start-up of a 0.5 tonnes/day demonstration unit last
June at Norsk Hydro's Porsgrunn complex, UOP and Hydro are offering
licences for their new natural gas to olefins process.

The MTO process uses methanol produced from natural gas to extend the
reaction to produce ethylene and propylene. In effect it is an add-on
to the usual natural gas to methanol route, allowing petrochemical
firms to vary end product according to state of the markets.

Using a fluidised-bed reactor and a highly-selective molecular-sieve
catalyst, the process is now reckoned to be commercially proven.

SIAM CEMENT AND DOW CHEMICAL JOINT VENTURE TO PRODUCE LLDPE

Thailand - Siam Cement, one of Thailand's largest conglomerates, and US-
based Dow Chemical announced a 4.75bn baht ($190m) joint venture to set
up a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) production facility in
Thailand.

The new plant, designed to produce 30,000 tonnes/yr (t/yr) of LLDPE,
will strengthen SCC's production capacity of polyethylene and propylene
and its derivatives to 1mt/yr in 1999, said to be the largest scale in
Asia.

According to SCC petrochemicals vice president Apiporn Pasawat, SCC and
Dow have incorporated Siam Polyethylene Co with a registered capital of
1.5bn baht to carry out the venture.

The two parties have an equal share in the scheme, to be located in Mab
Ta Phud Industrial Estate, Rayong. The plant, to be built on
technologies supplied by Dow, is scheduled on stream in 1999. Dow has
already been a partner with SCC in four other petrochemical projects.

Thai Polyethylene Co, part of Siam Cement, is currently the country's
sole producer of LLDPE with an annual production of 80,000 t/yr.
