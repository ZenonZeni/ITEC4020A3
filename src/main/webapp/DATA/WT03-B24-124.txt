<H1> Key Escrow Agent Criteria</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

An often heard concern regarding key escrow encryption 
is that users of such encryption are vulnerable to abuse 
of the escrowed key by the escrow agents or others. Many 
have suggested that changes in the law were needed that 
specifically, criminalize any such abuses. We agree that 
such laws will be beneficial in deterring act by anyone to 
access escrowed keys without authority or to undermine 
the integrity of the escrow key system.
<p>
However, the availability of criminal prosecution is not 
alone sufficient. Key escrow agents must be selected no 
only with a view towards assuring the availability of 
escrowed keys for properly authorized government 
officials, but also to assure that the escrow agents have 
the commitment and means to protect the confidentiality 
of integrity of the keys they escrow and the escrow 
system. This will be particularly important if, as expect 
will occur, some key escrow products will be designed 
such that the escrow agent could discern the identity of 
the user from the keys and other information that is 
escrowed with them.

<p>
The following criteria were drafted with these principals 
in mind. We have not yet addresses conditions under 
which users can be the sole repository of the keys for 
their system. We recognize that some organizations or 
people do not want anybody but themselves to escrow 
their keys. However, since an important reason for 
escrowing is to preserve effective law enforcement, we 
must assure authorized officials can reliably and timely 
obtain access to escrowed keys through entities 
independent of the subject of electronic surveillance. 
Thus we welcome suggestions on how best to meet this 
range of interests.
<p>
In considering the criteria appropriate for approving 
escrow agents, we considered what the government needs 
to assure it has timely and reliable access when 
authorized and what key escrow encryption users would 
want to ensure that the escrowing of keys foes not 
undermine their security. Of course, the government is 
also a user of key escrow encryption products and shares 
with other users an interest to ensure the integrity and 
security of the escrow system. Similarly, organizations 
interested in data recovery share the government’s 
interest to have a system through which access to 
escrowed key is enabled under appropriate 
circumstances. With these considerations in mind, we 
developed criteria in two categories, “Escrow System 
Integrity and Security” and “Key Access Requirements.” 
We expect that prospective escrow agents that meet 
criteria such as these would be considered “approved” 
escrow agents for export purposes, to hold keys for 
government systems, etc.
<p>
Note that keys and/or key components for devices that 
may process classified information shall be escrowed with 
escrow agents entities selected by the US government, 
and that those escrow agents entities may be required to 
meet more stringent requirements.
<p>
<h2>Escrow System Integrity and Security</h2>
<p>
1. Escrow agent entities shall devise and institutionalize 
policies, procedures, and mechanisms to ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of key escrow 
related information.
<p>
a. Escrow agents entities shall be designed and operated 
so that a failure by a single person, procedure, or 
mechanism does not compromise the confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability of the key and/or key 
components (e.g. two person control of keys, split key, 
etc.)
<p>
b. Unencrypted escrow key and/or key components that 
are stored and/or transmitted electronically shall be 
protected (e.g., via encryption) using approved means.
<p>
c. Unencrypted escrowed key and/or key components 
stored and/or transferred via other media/methods shall 
be protected using approved means (e.g. safes).
<p>
2. Escrow agent entities shall ensure due form of escrow 
key access requests and authenticate the requests for 
escrowed key and/or key components.
<p>
3. Escrow agent entities shall protect against disclosure 
of information regarding the identity of the 
person/organization whose key and/or key components 
is requested, and the fact that the key and/or key 
components was requested or provided.
<p>
4. Escrow agent entities shall enter key/key components 
into the escrowed key database immediately upon receipt.
<p>
5. Escrow agent entities shall escrow at least two copies 
of any key and/or key component in independent 
locations to help ensure the availability of such key 
and/or key component due to unforeseen circumstances.
<p>
6. Escrow agent entities that are certified by the U.S. 
government shall work with developers of key escrow 
encryption products to develop and support a feature that 
allows the product to verify to one another that the 
product’s keys have been escrowed with a U.S.-certified 
agent.
<p>
<h2>Key Access Requirement</h2>
<p>
7. An escrow agent entity shall employ one or more 
persons who possess a SECRET clearance for purposes of 
processing classified (e.g. FISA) requests to obtain keys 
and/or key components.
<p>
8. Escrow agent entities shall protect against 
unauthorized disclosure information regarding the 
identity of the organization requesting the key and key 
components.
<p>
9. Escrow agent entities shall maintain data regarding all 
key escrow requests received, key escrow components 
released, database changes, system administration 
accesses, and dates of such events, for purpose of audit 
by appropriate government officials and others.
<p>
10. Escrow agent entities shall maintain escrowed keys 
and/or key components for as long as such keys may be 
required to decrypt information relevant to a law 
enforcement investigation.
<p>
11. Escrow agent entities shall provide key/key 
components to authenticated requests in a timely fashion 
and shall maintain a capability to respond more rapidly 
to emergency requirements for access.
<p>
12. Escrow agent entities shall posses and maintain a 
Certificate if Good Standing from the State of 
Incorporation (or similar local/national authority).

<p>
14. Escrow agent entities shall possess and maintain an 
Errors & Omissions insurance policy.

government a written copy of, or a certification of the 
existence of, a corporate security policy governing the key 
escrow agent entity’s operation.
<p>
16. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. 
government a certification that the escrow agent entity 
will comply with all applicable federal, state, and local 
laws concerning the provisions of escrow agent entity 
services.
<p>
17. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. 
government a certification that the escrow agent entity 
will transfer to another approved escrow agent the escrow 
agent entity’s equipment and data in the event of any 
dissolution or other cessation of the escrow agent entity 
operations.
<p>
18. Escrow agent entities for products sold in the U.S.

entities for products exported from the U.S. will be 
approved on a case by case basis as law enforcement 
agreement and national security agreements can be 
negotiated.
<p>
19. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. 
government a certificate that the escrow agent entity will

periodic recertification.
