<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Enjoy Your Vacation While You Plan for Your Kid's
Education</STRONG></FONT><P>



	You've packed the car.  Your kids are buckled up and ready to go.  You remembered the
swim
fins,
the beach umbrella, and the gift for your friends in Florida.  This is going to be a terrific
vacation!  But as
you pull onto the highway, you get the strange feeling that there's something you forgot to
do.  <P>
	Even the most relaxed traveler can be preoccupied with the thought of starting an
investment plan
for
a child's college tuition.  You should know that there's no reason to procrastinate.  You can
just pick up
your car phone - or pull over at the next phone booth - and call your registered
representative to
discuss opening an UTMA account as soon as you return home.
<P>

<STRONG>What is UTMA?</STRONG><BR>
	The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) - and in certain states, the Uniform Gift to
Minors Act
(UGMA)-
may be a way for you to save on taxes as you save for your children's education.  As state
laws may
vary, investors should consult their personal legal/tax professional for additional
information.  (This
Web page discusses UTMA since it has been adopted in the majority of states.)<P>
	By setting up an account in the child's name under the UTMA, you can make a transfer of
up to
$10,000 per year per child, without affecting your lifetime unified gift/estate tax credit. 
Since your
spouse
can do the same, together you can give each of your children up to $20,000 per year,
shifting
all or part
of the investment earnings to the child's tax rate, which may be lower than your own.  Even
if your
transfer is less than $10,000, the strategy may offer potential tax benefits.  Here's how
earnings are
currently taxed in an UTMA account:<P>
	Until your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year is
covered by the
child's standard deduction and is not taxed.  The next $650 in unearned income may be taxed
at the
child's rate.  Unearned income above $1,300 per year is taxed at the parent's rate.<P>
	After your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year is
covered by the
child's standard deduction and is not taxed.  Remaining income may be taxed at the child's
rate.
<P>

<STRONG>Help Make Saving for College Less Taxing</STRONG><BR>
	The table shows how an UTMA transfer may help reduce taxes and build a larger fund for
future
expenses.  It assumes a systematic investment of $150 per month in an UTMA account for a
child,
starting at age seven.  The account earns a hypothetical eight percent annual return, before
taxes.  If the
child's tax rate is fifteen percent (after the first $650 on interest, which is not taxed)
and the parent's tax
rate is twenty-eight percent, the table shows the potential tax advantages of the UTMA
investment.

<FONT SIZE="-1">This
chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to predict or guarantee the
results of any investment, which will vary with market conditions and fluctuations.  This
chart assumes an inflation rate of 4%.  Accordingly, the child's standard deduction will
increase over time.</FONT>

<p>

<STRONG>Easy to Set up</STRONG><BR>
	Setting up an UTMA account in a child's name is easy.  The account will involve a
custodian; your
registered representative can guide you in completing the application.  Separate accounts are
required
for transfers to each child.  Be sure to provide the child's Social Security number (not that
of the person
making the gift or of the custodian).  The custodian will have full authority to make
decisions, including
control over investments.<P>
	Since transfers must be permanent, parents can't gain access to the money for their own
use. 
Also,
all assets in the UTMA account will belong to the child when he or she reaches the age of
majority.  You
may also want to consider the possibility that assets held in your children's names could
affect the
level of financial aid they'll be eligible to receive when they apply to schools.<P>
