Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Bill
H.R. 3610, P.L. 104-208
 Title II -- Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act 
  Subtitle D -- Consumer Credit
   Chapter 1 -- Credit Reporting Reform
    Sec. 2422. Federal Reserve Board Study.

      (a) STUDY REQUIRED- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
          System, in consultation with the other Federal banking agencies 
          (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) and
          the Federal Trade Commission, shall conduct a study of whether 
          organizations which, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, 
          are not subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act as consumer 
          reporting agencies (as defined in section 603 of such Act) are 
          engaged in the business of making sensitive consumer identification 
          information, including social security numbers, mothers' maiden 
          names, prior addresses, and dates of birth, available to the general
          public.

      (b) DETERMINATION OF POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD- If the Board of Governors of 
          the Federal Reserve System determines that organizations referred to 
          in subsection (a) are engaged in the business of making sensitive 
          consumer identification information available to the general public, 
          the Board shall determine--

              (1) whether such activities create undue potential for fraud and
                  risk of loss to insured depository institutions (as defined
                  in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act); and

              (2) if so, whether changes in Federal law are necessary to 
                  address such risks of fraud and loss.

       (c) REPORT TO CONGRESS- Before the end of the 6-month period beginning
           on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of
           the Federal Reserve System shall submit a report to the Congress 
           containing--

              (1) the findings and conclusion of the Board in connection with 
                  the study required under subsections (a) and (b); and

              (2) recommendations for such legislative or administrative
                  action as the Board determines to be appropriate.
