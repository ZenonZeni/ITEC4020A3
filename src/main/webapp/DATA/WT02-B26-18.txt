<H2>Campaign to End Discrimination Launched</H2>
<hr>


NAMI successfully launched its major, multi-year Campaign to End 
Discrimination against People with Severe Mental Illness at a 
February 1 press conference held at the National Press Club in 
Washington, D.C.
<P>
"This initiative is an historic attempt to end the stigma that has 
plagued our families and loved ones for centuries," said NAMI 
President Rona Purdy.  "We are letting the world know that it is 
not acceptable to discriminate against us anymore!"  NAMI Board 
Member Fred Frese of Ohio addressed the media with his family to 
tell the world what it is like to experience neurological brain 
disorders.  Dr. Rex Cowdry, acting director of the National 
Institute of Mental Health, provided the medical and scientific 
data supporting mental illnesses as treatable brain disorders.
<P>
	NAMI's campaign will work with the grassroots membership to 
tell the public that mental illnesses are brain disorders.  Year-
one efforts will confront discrimination against people with these 
illnesses--illnesses just like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease-
-in health care, reimbursement programs, employment practices, 
education, and housing.
<P>
	"I am delighted at the success of the press conference in 
terms of both the tremendous interest we generated and in the 
apparent societal readiness to receive our very important message--
which we will continue to send throughout our entire campaign," 
said NAMI Executive Director Laurie Flynn.
