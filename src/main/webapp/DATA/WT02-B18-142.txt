<p></p>
<p>The Support Services Division includes bargaining unit members
at the Information Service Centers, Mail Equipment shops,
Materiel Distribution Centers and Operating Services Facilities.
Support Services installations are located in Wilkes-Barre, PA;
Merrifield, VA; Washington, DC; Somerville, NJ; Topeka, KS;
Minneapolis, MN; St. Louis, MO and San Mateo, CA.</p>
<p>Separate contracts are negotiated for Support Services'
members. Their contracts basically mirror the National Agreement
in wages, benefits and working conditions. During 1994 contract
talks, APWU was successful in combining the Mail Equipment Shops
and the Materiel Distribution Centers into a new Article 41 under
the National Agreement. A goal of the Division is to merge with
the major crafts and work towards forming a true industrial
union. The Support Services Division is made up of a very diverse
bargaining unit. Members work in many specializations and job
classifications covering: clerical/technical work, computer
operations, programming, telecommunications, payroll processing,
customer support, manufacturing, warehousing and supply,
maintenance and custodial functions.</p>
<p>The Support Services Division contracts are administered by
NBA Greg Poferl (612) 854-0093 and Executive Assistant to the
President, Mike Benner (202) 842-4246.</p>
