Many suburban and urban soils need loosening before you plant. If the soil is compacted, till it to an area at least

five times the diameter of the root ball. Plant your new trees and shrubs on a cool or overcast day to reduce the stress

of relocating.<P>

      <UL>

<LI>Dig a hole in the tilled soil. The hole diameter should be roughly        twice the diameter of the root ball but

the same height as the root ball.

</UL>

     <UL>

<LI>If your soil is very heavy or sandy, mix quality compost or potting soil with the soil removed from the hole.

</UL>

      <UL>

<LI>Remove the plant from its container, gently freeing its roots.

</UL>

      <UL>

<LI>If the root ball is surrounded by burlap or wire, remove this before planting.

</UL>

     <UL>

<LI>Place the tree or shrub in the hole so that it sits at its original soil line.

</UL>

      <UL>

<LI>Firmly, but gently, fill the hole half full of the soil removed from the hole, and lightly tamp the area around the

root ball to remove air pockets.

</UL>

    <UL>

<LI>Water well, then fill the hole to the top with soil. Water again.

</UL>

      <UL>

<LI>Build a watering basin 3 inches to 4 inches (8 centimeters to 10 centimeters) high around the new plant, about twice

the diameter of the root ball.

</UL>

      <UL>

<LI>To retain root moisture and reduce weeds, cover the ground around the new plant with 4 inches (10 centimeters) of

mulch. Use well-aged organic materials such as old leaves and grass clippings, bark, and         aged sawdust or wood

chips.

</UL>

     <UL>

<LI>Keep the plant well watered for the first year, but be careful not to drown it! Watering deeply twice a week is

usually sufficient.
