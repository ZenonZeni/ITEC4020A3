<H2>Chapter 3:  Increase the Efficiency of Energy Use</H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>

 

Increased energy efficiency has provided the Nation with significant economic, environmental, and

security benefits over the past 20 years. To make further progress toward a sustainable energy

future, Administration policy encourages investments in energy efficiency and fuel flexibility in

key economic sectors. By focusing on market barriers that inhibit economic investments in

efficient technologies and practices, these programs help market forces continually improve the

efficiency of our homes, our transportation systems, our offices, and our factories.<BR>

<P>

In the past 20 years, the U.S. economy has grown by almost 65 percent. But the energy resource

that has satisfied the lion's share of our growing need for energy services was neither pumped nor

mined from the earth but, instead, was found in our homes, factories, and vehicles. The increased

efficiency of energy use-better insulated homes, more efficient manufacturing processes, and

better mileage in cars-has allowed us to reap the benefits of energy while using far less energy

than we otherwise would have. Fuel diversity has also increased over the past 20 years, as oil use

has fallen dramatically in the industrial, buildings, and electric utility sectors through efficiency,

fuel substitution, and increased use of fuel-flexible systems. Along the way, the Nation has

reduced its cumulative energy bill by more than $2 trillion and substantially reduced the

environmental burdens and security risks associated with using energy.<BR>

<P>

Figure 13 compares the sectoral changes in energy intensity that occurred from 1975 to 1991, and

it breaks the transportation and buildings sectors into their two major components. With the

exception of freight transportation, all parts of the economy showed declines in energy intensity

ranging from 14 to 27 percent. Freight transportation showed a 5-percent increase in energy

intensity largely because of declining load factors that more than offset the gains in vehicle

efficiency.<BR>

<P>

Much of this efficiency resource was tapped because people and companies often found that it was

cheaper to save energy than to buy it. Investing in efficient technologies allowed them to reduce

wasteful energy use and get the energy services they needed at less overall cost. Market forces

have provided incentives to use energy more efficiently. <BR>

<P>

However, many of the efficiency gains realized over the past 20 years were the result of

government policies to encourage, facilitate, and, in some instances, require investments in cost-

effective efficiency technologies. By addressing barriers to economically desirable investments in

energy efficiency, these policies continue to produce significant economic payoffs for all

Americans.<BR>

<P>

The opportunities for further gains are abundant. Studies have shown that efficient deployment of

existing technologies could save a substantial portion of the energy we currently use, while

lowering overall costs. Continued development of new technologies would compound potential

savings in the future. Not only would lowered energy use directly benefit the environment, but

such efficiency gains could also obviate the need for more expensive controls that would otherwise

be required to attain environmental goals. <BR>

<P>

Major opportunities still exist for substituting alternative fuels for oil in the transportation sector

and for introducing fuel-flexible technologies. These developments would create fuel competition

in the transportation sector and help diversify the energy sources that serve our transportation

needs.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.1">The Federal Role in Improving Energy Efficiency and Flexibility</H4></a>

Despite the progress already made and the many remaining opportunities, the pace of overall

efficiency gains has slowed over the past decade. Gains by alternative fuels are also slow; for

example, nonpetroleum-based fuels still represent only 3 percent of transportation energy use. Low

energy prices have contributed to the reduced pace of efficiency gains; conversely, efficiency gains

have deterred suppliers from raising energy prices. But these low prices have also limited our

attentiveness to cost-effective efficiency opportunities and have blunted the incentive for pursuing

them.<BR>

<P>

In this era of low prices, the Federal Government and the private sector can maximize energy

productivity by identifying and removing market barriers that inhibit cost-effective investments in

efficiency and flexibility. These barriers exist in varying degrees in all energy-use

markets-residential and commercial buildings, transportation, and industry-and remain a primary

target of energy policy. They include inadequate market information and incentives, lack of

accessible financing, inappropriately regulated markets, and fragmented technology and service

markets. By effectively addressing these barriers, energy policy can boost energy efficiency,

increase economic productivity, create jobs, and contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.<BR>

<P>

Government and the private sector also can increase energy efficiency in the long run by investing

in research and development (R&D) efforts. Government support is necessary because of the

high-risk nature of such technology development, the inability of private manufacturers to capture

the full benefits of such research, and the benefits to the general public (such as reduced pollution

and enhanced national security) that accrue from the application of these technologies.<BR>

<P>

Energy efficiency and fuel flexibility are key objectives on the path to a sustainable energy future,

and barriers to their achievement threaten sustainability. The Administration supports overcoming

barriers to energy efficiency and fuel flexibility by enhancing market forces and accelerating

technology development. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.2">Enhancing Market Forces</H4></a>

The ability of market forces to motivate economically desirable energy-efficiency investments can

be impaired by poor information, certain government regulations, the conflicting motivations of

owners and renters, inadequate financing, inaccessible accounting of external benefits or costs, and

many other factors. Energy policies that focus on specific "market imperfections" can improve the

effectiveness of market forces and lead to lasting improvements in energy and economic

efficiency. These procompetition policies can be as simple as providing better information to

energy users, and as complex as restructuring the electric utility industry. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.3">Accelerating Technology Development and Adoption</H4></a>

Continual improvements in the efficiency and fuel flexibility of energy-using technologies helps

enable sustainable development. But industry support of technology development is often hindered

by a focus on short-term profitability, a lack of resources, the inability of individual firms to

capture the full benefits of specific technology improvements, or the general underinvestment in

research that benefits the common good more than the corporate bottom line. And widespread use

of new technology is often prevented or delayed by persistent market or institutional barriers to

investment. Consequently, the second main strategy for improving energy efficiency and flexibility

entails support for the accelerated research, development, and deployment of new technologies.

This includes direct support of R&D as well as other policies to encourage or require the adoption

of new technologies.<BR>

<P>

Combinations of these strategies have proven highly effective in all energy markets. The remainder

of this chapter describes energy policy in each major market sector.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.4">Transportation: Improving Efficiency and Introducing Alternatives</H4></a>

Efficient transportation services sustain a vibrant economy and ensure the personal mobility of the

general population. Increasing transportation efficiency and fuel flexibility are cornerstones of the

Administration's transportation sector energy policy. These policies are critical to achieving the

Administration's goals of improving U.S. energy security and environmental quality, while also

reducing the economic risks posed by this sector's heavy dependence on oil.<BR>

<P>

Transportation-related goods and services make up approximately 17 percent of U.S. gross

domestic product (GDP), and our entire economy relies heavily on low-cost, highly flexible, and

rapid mobility of goods and services. U.S. transportation fuels are taxed at lower levels and have

the lowest delivered prices in the developed world (see Figure 5 in Chapter 2). In 1993, the average Federal and State gasoline tax was $0.37 per gallon (split about equally between Federal and State taxes). The average U.S. pump price of gasoline in 1994, at $1.17 per gallon, was its lowest in real terms since before World War II. <BR>

<P>

The transportation sector accounts for almost two-thirds of total U.S. petroleum consumption,

with cars and trucks alone accounting for more than 20 percent of total U.S. energy use. Last year

the United States used 38 percent more oil in transportation than was produced in U.S. oil fields.

Energy use in transportation has risen slowly over the past 15 years, as increased vehicle-miles

traveled (VMT) have more than offset increased average vehicle fuel economy. On average, every

American travels nearly 8,800 miles per year in a light-duty vehicle, and per capita VMT is

growing at a rate of more than 2 percent per year. Rapid growth in heavy-truck and airline travel

has also increased the demand for transportation energy. Increased use of heavy trucks

substantially outpaced modest efficiency gains, while in the airline industry, a rapid surge in

passenger-miles traveled offset a substantial increase in per-passenger fuel economy. Most

importantly, the transportation sector has not altered its virtually total dependence on petroleum.<BR>

<P>

Transportation energy use is the Nation's largest source of air pollution, with highway vehicles

alone accounting for 26 percent of U.S. emissions of volatile organic compounds, 

32 percent of emissions of oxides of nitrogen (the two principal precursors of ozone pollution in

urban areas), and 62 percent of total carbon monoxide emissions. The transportation sector

accounts for 32 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<BR>

<P>

To meet near-term objectives, the Administration's transportation energy policy encourages

increased efficiency in the existing stock of vehicles, promotes the expanded use of efficient

technologies in new vehicles, targets opportunities to reduce travel demand, and spurs the market

development of alternative transportation fuels. To ensure that the transportation system meets the

needs of the United States over the long term, the Administration has focused on developing

vehicle and fuel technologies that will substantially improve vehicle efficiency and enhance fuel

flexibility in this sector.<BR>

<P>

The Administration continues to develop policies to reduce the environmental impact of

transportation energy use. In implementing the Climate Change Action Plan, the Administration

established a Federal Advisory Committee to make recommendations by the fall of 1995 on

policies that cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles.

While the committee focuses on policies that reduce greenhouse gases, these same policies are

likely to address other strategic goals such as energy security, improved performance of the U.S.

transportation system, and environmental concerns other than climate change.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.5">Promoting Near-Term Efficiency Improvements</H4></a>

The Administration supports measures to promote fuel-economy improvements and to maintain

fuel-economy levels in the face of declining real fuel prices. These include the corporate average

fuel economy (CAFE) standard and the "gas guzzler tax," which applies to cars getting less than

21 miles per gallon. The current CAFE standard is 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles and 20.5

miles per gallon for light trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)

has initiated a rulemaking to set the light-truck standard in the future at its maximum feasible level.

Supporting these policies are education programs designed to ensure a well-informed marketplace.

For example, NHTSA is also developing rules to require fuel-economy labels for tires as an aid to

consumers, and the Federal Government's Gas Mileage Guide continues to assist consumers in

comparing the fuel efficiency of new cars and trucks. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.6">Developing Markets For Alternative Fuels</H4></a>

The Administration supports the development of markets for nonpetroleum-based alternative

fuels, including encouraging infrastructure investment and alternative-fuel vehicle technologies.

Alternative fuels include compressed natural gas, propane, electricity, methanol, and ethanol. These fuels are used in vehicles today, and some are used as nonpetroleum inputs to gasoline. The

environmental and energy security benefits of this market support will increase through time as

more advanced vehicle and fuel technologies become commercially available and as the refueling

infrastructure expands. <BR>

<P>

Current policies support an orderly market evolution under challenging conditions that include

perceived high risks, uncertain costs, and limited infrastructure for the distribution and use of

alternative transportation fuels. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, the Clean Air Act

Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a number of programs and

policy goals that are being implemented by the Department of Energy, the Department of

Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These programs have been

supplemented by new initiatives to further increase Federal agency purchases of alternative-fuel

vehicles and to support local efforts to bolster the use of alternative fuels through coordinated

Federal, local, and private efforts. <BR>

<P>

Current Federal programs and market developments are expected to lead to 2.5 million alternative-

fuel vehicles on the road by 2010.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.7">Reducing the Demand for Travel</H4></a>

The Administration supports increased efficiency in transportation systems to reduce travel

demand. Even with successful development of high-efficiency and alternative-fuel vehicle

technologies, stemming the rapid growth in annual VMT may be necessary to further reduce oil

use and air pollution over the long run. If recent growth trends are maintained into the future,

Americans will be driving twice as many miles in 2015 as we do today. Even given expected

reductions in the annual growth rates, the Energy Information Administration projects that VMT

will be more than 50 percent higher in 2010 than it was in 1990. A number of Administration

initiatives are designed to improve the efficiency of travel and to provide Americans with effective

modes of alternative travel. The Climate Change Action Plan includes new efforts to promote

telecommuting and to reform the tax code to allow commuters to choose between employer-

subsidized parking and cash. The Environmental Protection Agency has established the voluntary

Transportation Partners program, which assists localities in implementing and receiving credit for

transportation efficiency measures that reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants

by reducing demand for vehicle travel. The Administration is supporting considerable research to

develop "intelligent transportation systems," and experimental programs, such as the Department

of Transportation's Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, to improve understanding of the feasibility,

costs, and benefits of an array of strategies for increasing transportation system efficiency. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.8">Developing Technologies for a New Generation of Vehicles</H4></a>

Transportation technologies are key in the Administration's strategy for realizing energy security,

economic, and environmental goals. The Administration supports a policy of long-term, highly

focused R&D to improve vehicle fuel economy and <a name="alter"></a>alternative-fuel technologies and to make these technologies available to manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers.<BR>

<P>

On the vehicle side, the Administration's long-term development efforts include programs like the

government-industry <a name="png"></a>Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, which targets breakthrough technologies capable of increasing vehicle fuel efficiency by as much as three times current levels. To help achieve these potentials, the Government supports efforts such as the development of advanced materials, improved electric and hybrid vehicles, advanced battery concepts, fuel-cell vehicles, and lightweight vehicle body designs.<BR>

<P>

On the fuel side, Administration policy focuses on reducing the feedstock and production costs of

renewable fuels, such as hydrogen and biomass-based ethanol, and increasing the efficiency and

performance of alternative-fuel vehicle technologies. Hydrogen is used today as an input to a

variety of chemical processes and is generally produced from natural gas. Hydrogen can also be

extracted from water through electrolysis, using electricity generated from renewable resources,

biomass, and coal. The costs of producing, transporting, and storing hydrogen on vehicles must

decline before this clean-burning alternative can gain a share of the vehicle market.<BR>

<P>

Ethanol from various biomass sources is another promising long-term opportunity. Research is

under way to develop commercially competitive ethanol from low-energy-input crops and wastes

with desirable environmental attributes. The Department of Energy and the Department of

Agriculture coordinate research to lower the cost of producing starch-derived ethanol and

agricultural oil-based biodiesel fuels. Initially, these technologies would be commercialized by

using fiber and agricultural waste sidestreams from current production as feedstocks, but they

could ultimately evolve into independent domestic energy industries.<BR>

<P>

In addition to addressing energy security concerns, biofuels production creates new alternatives for

agricultural crops. Expanded biofuel production will add value to crops, increase farm income, and

build economic opportunity for rural communities. In addition to increasing on-farm economic

activity, biofuel production would also stimulate "upstream" industries that supply inputs to

farmers and would increase production in "downstream" sectors that process agricultural products

into final goods.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.9">Remaining Challenges and Opportunities</H4></a>

The transportation-related programs and policy initiatives outlined above represent a

comprehensive effort to capitalize on a range of opportunities to achieve national energy policy

goals. Nonetheless, there remain some further opportunities, issues not fully addressed, and

significant challenges to making the programs successful. The Administration continues to

examine new ways to increase efficiency in transportation, encourage the use of domestic

alternative fuels, and work with State and local governments to help manage the growing demand

for travel in ways that will enhance the overall economic and environmental performance of the

U.S. transportation system.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="3.10">Buildings: Overcoming the Barriers to Investments in Efficiency</H4></a>

Energy use in buildings accounts for 35 percent of total primary energy demand, 42 percent of

total energy costs, and 35 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions. Because utility bills are a

substantial part of family budgets, residential building energy use affects what kind of housing we

can afford and how comfortable and healthy we are at home. Energy use in the commercial sector

represents a cost to business and can have a substantial bearing on employee productivity. Recent

studies have concluded that the overall potential for reducing energy use in buildings through cost-

effective investments is on the order of 30 percent by 2015, with an overall enhancement of indoor

air quality, employee satisfaction, and comfort.<BR>

<P>

The Administration supports a strong, multifaceted effort to encourage cost-effective investments

in energy efficiency and to speed the development and introduction of new, efficient technologies

for buildings. Extensive barriers stand in the way of economically desirable energy-efficiency

investments in buildings. By enhancing the effectiveness of markets, developing new technologies, coordinating with State and local governments, strengthening codes and standards, and providing direct investment support to selected market segments, the Administration's energy policy substantially decreases building energy use and related costs.<BR>

<P>

Current Federal programs for building efficiency are estimated to result in $31.5 billion in annual

energy savings for consumers by 2010.</BODY>
