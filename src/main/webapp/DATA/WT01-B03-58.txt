<H4> ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION BY DONOR</H4>
<P>The Fertility Institute of Boca Raton treats many couples
in need of donor insemination. This is a highly successful
treatment option, as it involves treating a wife - who, in
many cases has no fertility problems - with a donor who has
been tested and found to be of optimum fertility
potential.</P>
<P>Couples choose this option in a number of circumstances:
when the husband is found to have a very low sperm count but
the couple does not wish to undergo the more involved route
of in vitro fertilization; when the husband has undergone
vasectomy and has been advised -or chooses - not to attempt
reversal; or when the husband is a carrier of a genetic
condition which makes conception of a biological child
inadvisable.</P>
<P>At the Fertility Institute of Boca Raton, the couple can
choose a donor from lists that provide full descriptions of
the donor. Complete medical histories are also available. We
work only with well-established, highly reputable national
sperm banks where the donors undergo strict testing.</P>
<P>After deciding to schedule artificial insemination, the
wife undergoes a basic fertility evaluation. The couple then
chooses a donor and orders their specimens. The wife monitors
her monthly cycle to pinpoint the time of ovulation, and is
inseminated here in our office. (It is a simple process, not
much different than having a pap smear). If pregnancy is not
established on the first attempt, the process can be
repeated.</P>
<P>Donor insemination is done in full confidentiality.
Neither the donor nor the sperm bank know the identity of the
couple, and the couple will never know the identity of the
donor. The decision of whether or not to tell the child how
he/she was conceived is a personal one, and resources are
available to help the couple make this important
decision.</P>
<H4>DONOR EGG IVF</H4>
<P>Couples choose donor egg IVF when the wife is unable to
produce eggs of her own; for example, if she has had her
ovaries removed surgically, has experienced premature
menopause, or simply has reached a point in her reproductive
life when her ovaries are no longer producing viable eggs.
Occasionally, a couple may also choose this route because of
a genetic condition which makes it inadvisable to use the
wife's eggs.</P>
<P>The donor can be anonymous or may be a relative of the
wife. The Fertility Institute of Boca Raton's anonymous
donors are women who have completed their families and wish
to donate eggs as an act of kindness. They are reimbursed
only for the time they devote to the process. We carefully
screen them medically and psychologically, and the couple is
provided with a complete description of the donor.</P>
<P>After the couple undergoes a brief screening and testing
process and is matched with a donor, the donor's eggs are
fertilized in our laboratory with semen provided by the
recipient husband, and the resulting embryos are transferred
to the recipient wife's uterus. Two weeks later, a pregnancy
test is done to determine whether or not pregnancy has been
established. </P>
<P>Because only donors with proven fertility are chosen,
studies have found that pregnancy rates are even higher with
donor egg IVF than with conventional IVF.</P>
