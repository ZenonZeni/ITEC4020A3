Robotics</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Sankyo Robotics</b></font> offers a
variety of proven cleanroom robotic systems for the handling of
wafers, disks, LCDs, MLCs, and for the assembly of disk drives
and other special subsystems. Sankyo's cleanroom robot systems
are Class 1, 10, or 100 capable, with designs that benefit from
more than 10 years of extensive research and actual application
use. Many special techniques are used in combinations to ensure
the cleanliness that is required:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sealing off the interior of the robot arm and then
        evacuating it so that all generated particulates are
        removed in a controlled manner.</li>
    <li>Internal robot and peripheral cabling so that
        particulates created by the inevitable rubbing and
        flexing can be captured and evacuated as part of the
        interior evacuation process.</li>
    <li>Special coatings and treatment of the various external
        robot surfaces and the use of stainless steel screws and
        special washers to minimize&nbsp;exterior-generated
        particulates.</li>
    <li>Proprietary fluorine-based greases with very minimal
        particulate production to lubricate any exposed moving
        surface, such as the splined shafts of the
        SR8437C&nbsp;and SR8438C SCARAs.</li>
    <li>Brushless servo motors which greatly reduces the number
        of particulates generated inside the robot arm.</li>
    <li>Special clean dust covers and evacuation schemes to
        minimize any particulate generation by linear axes.</li>
    <li>Arm configurations which position the cleanest parts of
        the robot arm over the sensitive product, such as with
        the CC-SCARA(TM) and CW-SCARA(TM) products.</li>
</ul>

<p>Various techniques have been used to certify a robot's design
and related cleaning techniques, but ultimately the customer's
satisfaction is what is most important. With more than 1000
Sankyo robots installed in cleanrooms throughout the world, this
is proof of Sankyo's cleanroom expertise and exceptional
performance of its cleanroom robot systems.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of Sankyo's cleanroom robot systems:</p>

<ul>
    <li>SR8437C SCARA with 250mm Z axis</li>
    <li>SR8437C SCARA with 550mm Z axis</li>
    <li>SR8438C SCARA with 150mm Z axis</li>
    <li>CC-SCARA in various sizes (for storage
        &amp;&nbsp;retrival of cassettes of wafer, disks)</li>
    <li>TM-SCARA in various sizes</li>
    <li>SR8101 Cylindrical 3-axis LCD&nbsp;Robot</li>
    <li>SR8105 Cylindrical 3-axis LCD&nbsp;Robot</li>
    <li>SR8112 Cylindrical 4-axis LCD&nbsp;Robot</li>
</ul>
