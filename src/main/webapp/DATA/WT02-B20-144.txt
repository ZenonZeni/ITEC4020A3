<b>A Longitudinal Study of Young Children with Fragile X Syndrome and Their
Families</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30081 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a longitudinal study of the development of at least
100 boys with Fragile X syndrome between birth and 72 months of age.  METHOD: 
Using growth curve analysis the project will characterize developmental patterns and
document the attainment of key developmental milestones in five domains: cognitive,
communicative, social, adaptive, and motor skills. The project will also document
stability and change in temperament and behavioral characteristics.  Interviews and
surveys will be used to describe unique family contexts among subject children.  A final
component of the study will determine clinicians' perceptions of the unique learning
styles and instructional or therapeutic strategies needed for young children with Fragile
X syndrome. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project hopes to provide a foundation for future
proposals including a longitudinal life span study of persons with Fragile X syndrome
and their families, as well as other research linking biological and environmental factors
to developmental outcomes.  Dissemination efforts will include promotional brochures, a
monthly newsletter, curriculum materials, and handbooks.<P>

<b>Age of Peers and Its Effects on the Social Interactions of Preschoolers with
Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20168 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project involves a 5-year series of studies that will investigate the
extent to which age of peers influences the development of social skills among
preschoolers with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  In the first 2 project years, 80 3- and 4-year-olds with mild disabilities will be
paired with four different play partners for two play sessions each.  Sessions will be
analyzed for level, complexity, and nature of social interactions.  The second series of
studies will examine whether or not repeated opportunities for dyadic play with a
younger child improve generalized social skills of 4-year-old children with disabilities, as
has been observed to be the case with nondisabled children with low rates of social
interaction.  Thirty 4-year-olds with mild disabilities will be randomly assigned to dyadic
play with a same-age peer, dyadic play with a younger child, or a control group.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  These studies will increase understanding of how peers
influence social interactions of young children with disabilities.  Important information on
the need to consider peer characteristics when designing early intervention programs to
promote social competence will result.  Project findings will be disseminated through
journal publications, presentations at conferences, and development of guidelines for
teachers in child care settings serving young children with disabilities.<P>

<b>Elementary School and Boys with Fragile X Syndrome </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50034 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct the elementary school portion of a longitudinal,
life-span study of boys with Fragile X syndrome.<P>

METHOD:  Project staff are currently conducting the early childhood portion of this
study, gathering data on the early development, temperament, behavior, and patterns
of
family coping and adaptation of 100 boys.  During the elementary phase, research
questions will focus on: (1) developmental, functional, and school achievement growth
patterns; (2) factors that influence development and achievement; (3) the development
of social competence and peer relations; (4) factors influencing social competence and
peer relations; (5) the nature and quality of school experiences provided during the
elementary years; (6) the needs and concerns of teachers working with boys with
Fragile X syndrome; (7) effective strategies for enhancing achievement and social
competence; and (8) patterns of family coping and adaptation during the elementary
years.  Eighty boys and their families will be followed between 1st and 5th grade to
answer these questions.  Mixed method designs and hierarchical linear analyses will be
used to chart patterns of growth and change, identify correlates of change, and
determine successful educational and intervention strategies.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be submitted to leading journals for
peer review and publication, and also presented at state, regional, and national
conferences related to child development, education, and family support.  Specific
project publications will include: a manual for parents describing in simple language the
early development and needs of children with Fragile X syndrome; a guide for teachers
and therapists who work with these children and their families; and a professional guide
summarizing findings from the survey of professionals, which will also describe
important factors to consider in working with families. <P>

<b>Parent-Child Interaction Systems: A Long Term Evaluation</b> <br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023N30028 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will use an existing parent-child interaction data set to improve
the usefulness of parent-child interaction scoring systems, and to further the knowledge
of the nature and effects of the mother-child interaction.<P> 
METHOD:  In addition to identifying parent and child behaviors that correlate with
measures of child development, research will identify parent and child characteristics
and parents' perceptions of stress, social support, and resources that best correlate
with
parent interaction behaviors.  After the existing data set has been coded to measure
both mother and child behavioral dimensions in order to examine the bidirectionality of
the interaction, a number of analyses will be performed, including: a factor analysis to
determine factor structures of all relevant systems, analyses to demonstrate criterion
and predictive validity, and analyses to establish the relationship between the variables
set forth in project objectives.  The stability and change within dyads of parent-child
interaction will further be examined over time.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  By establishing criterion-related and predictive validity of
coding systems employed, staff will enable clinicians, practitioners, and researchers to
better choose and employ the coding system best suited to their needs.  A monograph
will be produced by project staff and consultants during the final year.  Summaries of
findings will be disseminated through a newsletter and computer bulletin boards.<P>

<b>An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Staffing Patterns for Young Children Attending
Natural Group Environments for Early Intervention</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30072 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine the effects of different service delivery structures
on the development of toddler-age children with disabilities (and their families) receiving
early intervention within natural group environments.<P>

METHOD:  The study will compare four different service delivery structures within
natural group settings with toddler-age children with disabilities receiving services under
the Department of Mental Retardation.  Children will be assigned staff and services
through the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) process.  The four service
delivery structures to be evaluated will include: (1) a full-time teacher within the group
environment the entire time the child attends and therapy (as needed) delivered within
the group environment; (2) a full-time teacher within the group environment the entire
time the child attends and therapy delivered (as needed) outside the natural group
environment; (3) a teacher attending the natural group environment at least once a
week for consulting purposes and therapy delivered (as needed) within the natural
group environment; and (4) a teacher attending the natural group environment at least
one time a week for consulting purposes and therapy delivered outside the natural
environment.  Evaluation of these service structures will occur on a 3-month basis
during a 12-month enrollment period for each child.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will expand the current knowledge base on
the effects of receiving early intervention in natural group environments in a number of
ways.  Findings will be presented at state, local, and national conferences, and articles
and descriptions of service delivery practices will be prepared for journals and
newsletters.  Research monographs will be generated on methodology and findings,
and training manuals will be prepared on service delivery practices found to be
effective.<P>

<b>Longitudinal Study of Risk and Protective Factors Affecting the Development of
Children Prenatally Exposed to Illicit Drugs and Alcohol</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50111 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/31/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate early elementary school experiences and
developmental outcomes of children with documented exposure to illegal drugs during
pregnancy. <P>
METHOD:  Cohorts of both drug-exposed and nonexposed children ages 5 - 9 years
(N=60 children in each cohort) will be followed during their early schooling.  Within each
cohort, 40 children will have had prenatal exposure to illegal drugs and/or alcohol and
the remaining 20 will be a comparison group with no documented exposure.  For the
first cohort, the work represents a four-year extension of a completed two year
developmental study.  For the second cohort, this study provides an opportunity to
replicate and cross-validate developmental trajectories and findings from the earlier
research with Cohort 1.  Since a wide variety of factors have been found to influence
student outcomes and adjustment, measures of prenatal drug exposure; family risk and
protective factors, developmental status, child behavior at home and school,
environmental factors, academic achievement, and social/emotional adjustment will all
be used.  Individual testing, observations in the classroom and on the playground, and
school archival record searches will be employed to gather data for these measures. 
Data analyses will be conducted to: (1) examine differences between groups; and (2)
explore the variance; accounted for by drug exposure, independent of other variables,
in
the prediction of later school success and failure. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of the first analytical study (of Cohort 1 from ages
3-9) will be incorporated into preservice training in graduate university coursework. 
Annual reports will be developed and presentations will be made at national and
regional gatherings of professionals, researchers, and educators, as well as articles
submitted to professional journals to reach this same audience. <P>

<b>Committee on Prevention of Reading Difficulties in Young Children</b> <br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023S50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 11/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 11/14/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a thorough study of contemporary research on the
development of pre-reading and reading skills, the assessment of factors associated
with reading problems, and the comparative effectiveness of formal and informal
interventions for young children who are at risk for developing reading problems.<P> 
METHOD:  The study will be carried out by a committee of experts in cognitive science,
developmental psychology, neuroscience, teaching and learning, literacy, and special
education.  The research that will be reviewed includes advances in cognitive
psychology, early childhood development, neurology, ethnography, and related fields. 
Promising methods for early identifiction of reading problems will be examined, as will
the scientific bases and effectiveness of various educational and other interventions for
particular groups of children, including those with cognitive or neurological deficiencies,
those from impoverished or minority subcultures, and perhaps those with limited
English
proficiency.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the study's conclusion, the committee will issue a
scholarly report identifying effective approaches to assessment, prevention, and
intervention in a range of settings including schools, preschools, Head Start programs,
child care centers, social service agencies, doctors' offices, health care clinics, and the
home.  In addition, the committee intends to develop a series of concise publications
tailored to specific  audiences, and will explore the possibility of separately funded
dissemination venues, including public media. <P>

<b>A Longitudinal Study of Developmental Patterns of Children Who are Visually
Impaired</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10188 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This study will examine the sequence and rate of development of children,
ages birth to 6, who are blind or visually impaired.  Measures of visual acuity, behavior,
temperament, and environment will be obtained in an effort to determine first, if there
are differences between development of blind and sighted children and, if there are,
what variables might be identified as predictors or correlates to development.<P> 
METHOD:  This longitudinal study will be accomplished through a collaborative effort of
Teachers College, Columbia University, and a national consortium of six service
providers that will be established to cooperate in the collection of data.  An assessment
battery will be selected by the project Technical Advisory Committee, which will cross
the three domains of child variables (such as developmental quotient, visual acuity, and
health status), family variables (such as socioeconomic status, demographics, and
mother-child interaction), and program variables (such as home vs. hospital, support
services, and curriculum).  Project staff will conduct training of two project evaluators
from each participating program who will collect data in their programs.  Subjects will be
children with visual disabilities who are referred to and served by the programs
participating in this study; it is foreseen that the study will include a sample size of 300
children per 1-year cohort.  Yearly analyses will be conducted of the patterns emerging
in the three sets of variables, their interaction, and their influence on child competence
and family adaptation.  The normative data collected in this study will be analyzed by
measures of central tendency, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Annual data will be pooled with previous data and
reported to the field by means of project reports.  Dissemination efforts will include
these annual reports, journal articles, and a final report.<P>

<b>Research on Treating Aggression in Young Children</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023N40039 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will systematically replicate and extend the findings of a pilot
investigation, in which the rate of aggression across four children decreased to
normative levels through the use of observational learning of high status peers,
individualized training scripts, and a self-evaluation paradigm.<P> 
METHOD:  Staff will develop an observation system and a computerized system of
situation descriptions.  Replication studies of pilot research will then be conducted,
followed by two additional studies with Native American subjects.  In a small group
setting, children will watch high status peer models discriminate between positive and
negative examples of social interactions, state positive alternatives to aggression, and
practice positive social interactions using puppets.  Following study of peer models,
subjects will practice these same responses and will be tested with novel scenes for
knowledge acquisition.  Following training, the effects of a self-peer-teacher evaluation
procedure to enhance generalization from training settings to observational settings will
be tested.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will create a training methodology which
will: (1) reduce the probability of young children being placed in special education and
support friendships and long-term inclusion in general class settings; and (2) reduce
aggressive behaviors in young Native American children attending tribal public school,
day care, and/or Head Start.  In addition to dissemination of the computer program,
observation system and training package, findings will be disseminated via a series of
journal articles and conference presentations as well as a final report for the funding
agency.<P>

<b>Early Intervention Benefit/Cost Longitudinal Study</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20066 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will provide credible evidence on the benefits and costs of
early intervention programs, including programs that vary by intensity, the degree of
parent involvement, and age at start.<P>

METHOD:  Data will be examined from a benefit-cost follow-up study of 430 children
with a variety of disabilities including visual impairments, intraventricular hemmorrhage,
medical fragility, and others who received early intervention from the Early Intervention
Research Institute from 1985-1990.  Subjects were randomly assigned to control and
experimental groups where both groups of children received treatment.  Experimental
treatment either began earlier, was more intensive, or added a parental involvement
component in addition to the control services.  By following both groups of students
longitudinally, the study will estimate benefits to families and society that result from the
early intervention received. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  By comparing dollars spent with dollars saved, this
project
will provide a perspective previously unavailable in the field of early intervention for
children with disabilities and will help to answer questions regarding which early
intervention programs serve children and the community best.<P>

<b>Prevention of Antisocial Behavior Patterns Among Children Grades K-3 </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H237B20024 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  This project will develop, evaluate, and disseminate a model program for
the early identification and primary prevention of conduct disorders and antisocial
behavior patterns in kindergarten-level children. <P>

METHOD:  The project will consist of four phases of approximately 1-year's duration
each, as follows: (1) Feasibility Study; (2) Intervention and Longitudinal Tracking; (3)
Replication and Longitudinal Tracking; and (4) Longitudinal Tracking and Follow-up. 
The model intervention program to be developed will have a dual focus on direct child
intervention and family support and intervention.  A state of the art early intervention
program will be developed for delivery by school-based consultants and a model family
support component will also be developed focusing on: (1) improving target parents'
effective parenting practice; and (2) accessing needed services available from
community and state social service agencies. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The components of this model program will be packaged
in year 4 and selected, key school district staffs in the state of Oregon will be trained in
them.  The final package will be broadly disseminated to the field and made available to
professionals for the cost of reproduction and mailing.  Training and technical
assistance to potential model program adopters will be negotiated as appropriate with
interested school districts and programs. <P>

<b>Programming Integration of Preschoolers (Project PIP): Developing Peer
Relationships Between  Children With and Without Developmental Disabilities</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10167 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/91 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The study will investigate the effects of interventions designed to enhance
social-communicative interaction among preschoolers with developmental disabilties.
<P>
METHOD:  At least 40 preschoolers with developmental disabilities, and an equal
number of nondisabled classmates will participate.  Exchange theory will be applied to
analyzing interaction patterns and to generating strategies for modifying interaction
patterns to produce more acceptable outcomes for social partners and lessen the
desire
to terminate interactions and relationships.  Some basic characteristics of
peer-mediated intervention tactics will be modified, such as spreading interventions
across the day, rather than conducting concentrated training sessions.  Interventions
will involve: (1) teaching typical peers to use ecobehaviorally derived strategies for
interaction with their disabled classmates; (2) teaching fundamental social skills to
children with disabilities; and (3) a treatment package based on the functional
components of these interventions.  In addition, longitudinal effects will be monitored
and investigations of intervention components that appear necessary to ensure that
children with disabilities continue to interact with typical classmates and develop peer
relationships in subsequent educational placements will be conducted.  Single-subject
experimental designs will be used to evaluate outcomes.  The effects of intervention will
be assessed with observational, sociometric, and teacher and parent rating measures. 
In addition to analyses of changes in the rates of social behavior demonstrated by
children, conditional probability analyses of sequential data will be used to continue the
process of identifying strategies that prove particularly effective in promoting sustained
interaction.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The experimental procedures developed and validated in
the studies will form the basis for two training manuals on: (1) daily intervention to
promote constructive social-communicative interaction in integrated preschools, and (2)
facilitating social adaptation of children with disabilities during transitions from
preschool.  Dissemination efforts will include publication of the training manuals,
research papers, papers focusing on the clinical procedures, and training workshops for
practitioners.<P>

<b>Longitudinal Assessment of Emerging Behavior State Patterns Among Infants and
Children with Severe and Profound Disabilities</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30029 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will systematically investigate changes in state during the first
few months and years of life, and will identify variables and conditions that potentially
impact the emergence of various state organization patterns.<P> 
METHOD:  A longitudinal research design will measure state behavior across early
months and years of life among 25 infants at high risk for profound and severe
disabilities.  Additionally, a General Systems Theory approach will be adopted to
investigate the process of emerging state patterns in relation to other interacting
variables, such as: levels of cognitive, motor, and social development; quality and
frequency of rhythmic patterns; communicative skills; social interactions with caregivers;
and medical interventions and health status. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of this research will provide intervention
programs
with important information for assisting in the development of more stable and adaptive
state patterns in persons with profound and multiple disabilities.  Findings from the
project will have additional implications for the assessment and treatment of traumatic
brain injury, and the behavioral changes and physical losses associated with aging.<P>

<b>The Impact of Federal Policy and Resulting Legislation on Family Systems</b>
<br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10103 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 12/15/91 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/14/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study how early intervention provided to infants and
toddlers impacts families, and specifically, how families perceive these services.  The
study will examine three assumptions: (1) families need and welcome these services
and supports; (2) early interventionists know how to validly assess family needs and
develop programs to meet them; and (3) these services will enhance the developmental
potential of infants and toddlers who are disabled or at risk.<P> 
METHOD:  Researchers will collaborate with the University of Oklahoma Medical
Center
in the early identification of approximately 36 families of neonates who are at significant
risk due to genetic/congenital conditions, birth trauma or prematurity, and/or
combinations of maternal risk factors (e.g. age, substance abuse, AIDS, etc.).  Over a
5-year period, qualitative methodologies will be used to probe the perceptions and
experiences of parents (and when appropriate, siblings) of infants, toddlers, and
preschoolers.  Twelve families will be identified in year 1 and followed over 3 years. 
Twelve new families will be added each of the first 3 years.  A total of three intensive,
audiotaped interviews will be conducted per year for each family, including interviews
conducted with a significant other outside the family, but involved in the family system in
order to triangulate the data collected.  The first interview will be designed to probe the
issues of: (1) initial communications with professionals from a variety of disciplines; (2)
transitions from hospital to home; (3) contacts from and referrals to additional services
and resources; (4) realizations and adjustments to the infant's needs; (5)
self-perceptions and coping; and (6) perceptions of assistance received from
professionals and interpersonal networks.  Follow-up interviews will further document
the nature of services, supports and/or resources provided to or sought by the
families.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products will include five annual research reports, a final
monograph, book, and field guidelines for parent involvement in early intervention. <P>

<b>A Longitudinal Follow-up of Graduates from Two Contrasting Preschool
Instructional
Models: Phase 2 </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30007 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study the lasting effects of two approaches to preschool
education as well as the course of development of preschool graduates as they
progress from childhood to adolescence, passing through two critical school transition
periods. <P>
METHOD:  The subjects of the study will be 197 elementary and middle school children
who qualified for special education and participated in a previous preschool intervention
study.  These children, who have mild to moderate delays in cognitive and language
skills, received either an academically based Direct Instruction model or a cognitively
based Mediated Learning model for between 1 and 3 years of intervention.  Subjects
will be followed through another five years of schooling and the associated transitions. 
Evaluation instruments will include a variety of cognitive, academic, social, adjustment,
school placement, and employment measures.  Data analysis will vary according to the
research question addressed, and include repreated measures analysis of variance,
multiple regression, survival analysis, and growth curve analysis techniques. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will generate much-needed information on:
the ability to match instructional programs to students; long-term effects of numerous
models for early intervention, with some retrospective information on children's

<b>Facilitation of Intersubjectivity to Remediate Language Delay of Preschool Children
with Mental Retardation</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20077 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This 4-year project will investigate the effectiveness of interventions to
facilitate language development of toddlers and preschoolers with mental retardation.
The premise underlying the six studies in the project is that intersubjectivity must be
established in order for the child with disabilities to utilize the verbal and nonverbal
information from others with whom he or she interacts. The project will describe and
test
experimental efforts to facilitate the establishment of joint referential states for
communicative exchanges.<P>

METHOD:  The studies will examine both descriptively and experimentally the
integration of cognitive, affective, social, communicative, and language skills during the
first 5 years of life. In Study 1, extant videotapes from at least 200 mother and infant
dyads (infants ranging in mental age from 10-18 months) will be coded in real time to
indicate their attentional state vis-a-vis both objects and their mothers. The
development
of joint attentional state will be described from this cross-sectional sample of young
children in comparison to published reports on normally developing children.
Seventy-six children will be involved in the remaining five longitudinal experimental
studies. Studies 2, 3, and 4 will utilize prototypic interactive computer games for
sensorimotor skills and storybooks as one context to compare to more typical dyadic
play and storybook contexts in terms of the establishment of joint reference and
communication. In Study 2, teachers will attempt to establish joint reference with young
children with disabilities in the context of an object permanance computer game ("Find
the Bunny") or during play with mechanical toys. Study 3 will be a replication of Study 2
except that parents and their children with disabilities will be involved.  Ongoing
analysis
of videotapes of teaching sessions will provide the empirical basis for suggestions
about
ways to facilitate joint attention and communication within these contexts. A computer
controlled videotape analysis system will be used with both keyboard and voice input to
expedite the tape rating and feedback process. In Study 4, parents will be provided with
interactive, computerized storybooks or regular storybooks to examine the utility of
reading activities as joint referential and communication contexts. Study 5 will broaden
the study to establishment of joint reference and language production in a small group
setting (3 children, 1 teacher) in which simple play scripts are enacted (e.g., snack time,
putting a baby to bed). Half of the children will be involved in a small group with one
child who does not have disabilities and half will be in contexts including only children
with disabilities. In Study 6 the investigation of interventions to facilitate joint referential
states and lanuguage production will be conducted in large group free play situations in
a structured classroom which is integrated with children who do not have disabilities or
in one that includes only children with disabilities. An intensive collection of data on
language use and sensorimotor skills will ensure comparability across the 276 subjects
involved in these cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.  <P> ANTICIPATED
PRODUCTS:  In addition to the findings from the studies, an outcome of the project will
be the development of an observational technology from which complex social process
descriptions can be completed, analyzed, and used as the basis for suggestions on
how
to modify interactions with young children with disabilities. The studies will provide
evidence about the relative effectiveness of new language intervention techniques for
early childhood special educators who work with children who have both developmental
and language delays. <P>

<b>Using Behavioral Momentum to Increase Children's Instructional Engagement</b>
<br> GRANT NUMBER: H023A50093 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine the effects of behavioral momentum on
children's instructional engagement within naturalistic instructional contexts.  METHOD: 
In Study 1, high-probability mands will be interspersed with low-probability mands. 
Children's attempts to respond to low-probability mands, correct responses to
low-probability mands, and duration of time children are engaged in learning activities
will be examined using a multiple probe design.  Four students in a classroom
averaging
12-15 preschool students will participate in Study 1 during center-time activities.  Mand
testing will be conducted using high-interest, thematically-based sets of toys.  In Study
2, high-probability mands will be used prior to introducing low-probability response
situations (response situations in which a child response is not required).  Children's
attempts to respond and their correct responses will be examined in these situations
with low-probability behaviors and with high-probability behaviors.  Study 2 will utilize
similar students and preschool settings, but subjects will be provided with
low-probability
response contexts (teacher self-questioning) instead of high-probability contexts. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research reports and manuscripts will be prepared for
professional journals in special education.  Research results and information on
behavioral momentum will also be presented at state professional conferences, and will
be integrated into the Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation's teacher
training program for early childhood special educators.<P>

<b>An Exceptional Analysis of Teacher/Parent Mediated Interventions for Preschoolers
with Behavioral Problems</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20172 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This research project will empirically investigate the efficacy of an
expanded intervention appropach involving behavioral consultation with parents and
teachers of preschool children who are at risk for social-emotional difficulties 
METHOD: 
Children experiencing social withdrawal and isolation and children experiencing conduct
difficulties will be identified, treated, and monitored for approximately 3 to 5 years, from
preschool through early elementary school transitions.  Screening procedures and
teacher referrals will identify 120 3-5 year-olds in Head Start programs.  Children
selected for the project will be assigned randomly to experimental and control
conditions.  In the experimental group, children will be further assigned randomly to
baselines in a multiple baseline design.  Consultants trained in behavioral consultation
will work with parents and teachers to deliver a treatment package either for social
withdrawal or for conduct disorders.  Treatment programs will include social skills
interventions supplemented with parent and teacher behavior management strategies. 
Consultants will also monitor students' progress as they make the transition into
elementary school.  <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In the area of practice, products will include: (1) treatment
packages for socially withdrawn and preschool students with mild conduct disorder; (2)
treatment integrity checklists and rating scales for monitoring the implementation of
specific treatments; and (3) foundation of an effective preschool consultation and
intervention model put in place in a county Head Start organization.  Contributions to
research will increase understanding of effects of conjoint behavioral consultation with
teachers and parents. <P>

<b>Investigations of Early Motor Intervention Procedures <br> GRANT NUMBER:
H023C30127</b> <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/91 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the relative effectiveness of two motor
intervention approaches for children with Down syndrome and children with cerebral
palsy: the Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT) approach, and the Peabody
Developmental Motor Program (PDM).<P>

METHOD:  Interventions will be conducted with 60 children with Down syndome
children and 60 children with cerebral palsy children (ages 6 to12 months at the
beginning of the study) during the first 3 years of their lives.  Subjects will come from
approximately 12 different sites from the southeastern portion of the United States,
each
of which provides only one of the two treatment models being investigated.  Treatments
will be administered by the regular interventionists at these sites, who have been
trained
to proficiency in the model they are required to implement.  The study is based on a
pre-
post multifactorial design that will assess the relative contribution of several variables to
two major outcomes of intervention services: (1) the level of family involvement with
their child after 12 and 24 months of services, and (2) the fine and gross motor gains
that the children have attained after 12 and 24 months of intervention.  Four factors will
be used to assess family involvement in the child's intervention program including the
amount of time that primary caregivers engage in therapeutic motor exercises with their
child, and the style of the primary parent/caregiver during interacting with the child. 
Both quantitative and qualitative procedures will be used to assess motor outcomes
that
children attain.  In addition, the study will determine whether the effects of these
curricula are replicable across sites.  A cost benefits analysis will examine the
magnitude of motor gains that children attain in motor intervention programs as a
function of the monetary and family resource expenditures that are required to produce
these gains. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include a technical report to
be advertised for distribution after 12 months of intervention data, state and national
conference presentations, and journal articles.<P>

<b>Prenatal Cocaine Exposure and Social Development of Young Children: A Field
Initiated Research Project </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10092 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/91 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a 5-year program of descriptive and
intervention-based research that increases both knowledge regarding social and other
developmental outcomes for young children exposed prenatally to cocaine and
resources for providing early intervention to this group.<P> 
METHOD:  Subjects for all studies will be infants and young children (6 months to 6
years of age) who were exposed to cocaine prenatally and (for Study 1, the longitudinal
study, only) non-exposed matched controls.  Cocaine-exposed children will be recruited
primarily by contacting mothers served by the Mother Baby Chemical Health Program
of
Group Health, Inc., in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.  Throughout the
seven studies, specific instruments have been selected to provide three different types
of measures of the social development of children exposed prenatally to cocaine: (1) a
general, performance-based outcome measure of social competence; (2) measures of
the type, quantity, and quality of social interactions in home and care/school settings;
and (3) direct assessment of other aspects of the child's development.  Study 1,
involving 50 drug-exposed children and 50 non-exposed matched controls, will consist
of a 5-year, longitudinal descriptive analysis of social and other developmental
outcomes.  Four experimental studies (focusing in turn on environmental arrangements,
teacher-mediated interventions, affection training activities, and parent training to
promote social interaction competence) will each produce a set of empirically valid
intervention procedures.  In the final 2 years of the project, these separate intervention
procedures will be combined into a comprehensive treatment package, and the effects
of this package will be evaluated for both short- and long-term effects on the social
interaction of young children.  Data analysis will include ANOVAs and MANOVAs, and
mulitple baseline across subjects designs for the intervention studies.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will be directed at early
intervention personnel and researchers and will include journal articles, conference
presentations, training materials, and teacher manuals.<P>

<b>Maximizing Effective Teacher-Mediated Intervention in Inclusive Preschools
Implementing Developmentally Appropriate Practice </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023N40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>


ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  This project will develop and validate a package of teacher-mediated
intervention strategies that can be effectively used to teach preschool children with
developmental delays and disabilities.  The children involved in the study are enrolled in
inclusive preschool programs implementing developmentally appropriate practices. <P> 
METHOD:  The studies combine single subject methodology, eco- behavioral
measures, a national survey, and social validity measures to examine: (1) the
effectiveness of the teacher-mediated intervention package across a variety of
participants and target skills, specifically addressing skill acquisition, generalization, and
maintenance; (2) the comparative effectiveness of the full teacher-mediated
intervention
package with two subcomponents of the package, including each interventionists' effect
on child outcomes and their acceptability to the interventionist; (3) the effects of
implementation of the package on subjects' level of enagagement, interactions with
peers, and selected variables within the classroom; (4) the extent to which a cumulative
training package is effective in teaching preschool teachers to implement the package
for the purpose of teaching skills to children with developmental disabilities; (5)
perceptions of preschool teachers who have implemented the combined intervention
package; and (6) the perceptions of parents of preschool children concerning the
procedures and outcomes of intervention.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project results will be disseminated through publication of
research reports to early childhood and special education journals, as well as
presentations at national conferences.  A cumulative Effective Teacher-Mediated
Intervention training manual will also be developed and disseminated along with a
trainers' guide. <P>

<b>Teaching Styles in Early Intervention: Responsiveness and Directiveness</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94  <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/99

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will research the extent to which teachers of infants, toddlers,
and preschoolers with disabilities should teach by: (1) responding to child initiations; (2)
giving them directions; and (3) combining responsiveness and directiveness. 
METHOD: 
Staff will conduct research in three stages to address relevant issues: (1) naturalistic
inquiry in classrooms; (2) experimental inquiry in classrooms; and (3) experimental
inquiry in one-on-one teaching situations.  Ten teachers and their students (N=60: 20
with disabilities; 40 without disabilities) at a university child care center will be used in
Study 1.  The naturalistic inquiries will provide information about the current state of
practice in a small sample of teachers and children, which will guide procedures and
measurement systems for controlled experiments.  The first controlled experiment,
again with a small sample, will guide the development of procedures for a large
field-based controlled experiment. Four substudies in the first 2 years will be
implemented to conduct the naturalistic inquiry.  First, the effects of teaching style on
child engagement will be investigated.  Second, the antecedents of teaching styles will
be studied.  Third, the long-term outcomes differentiated by teaching style will be
researched.  Fourth, the classroom atmosphere will be investigated with qualitative
procedures.  The second major study, conducted in Year 3, will consist of training
teachers to use three different styles and analyzing child engagement.  The third major
study, conducted in Years 4 aqnd 5, will investigate engagement and task performance
of children in teacher-child dyads exposed to specific teaching styles.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The results of this research will expand the knowledge
base regarding the relationship between teaching and child behavior in the field of early
intervention, provide information of use to teachers and parents as they implement
interventions, and guide preservice and inservice efforts to train teachers to use
developmentally appropriate and effective methods.<P>

ENDING DATE:  7/31/96

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine variables that may influence the effects of
high-probability response situations on low-probability response situations.  METHOD: 
This study will examine the effects on long and short inter-trial intervals between
high-probability response opportunities.  High probability responses to mands (i.e.,
obligated commands that call for child response) will be followed by low-probability
mands.  Children's attempts to respond to low-probability response mands, correct
responses to low-probability response mands, and duration of time children are
engaged in learning activities will be examined within an alternating treatments design. 
In addition, three early childhood special educators will be asked to sub- jectively
evaluate the instructional procedures using a questionnaire.  Participating subjects will
be ten preschool-aged children with develop-mental delays attending various local
preschool programs.  The study will be conducted during center-time activities in the
selected classrooms or at Head Start.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will begin to identify systematic
instructional
procedures in the natural environment that early childhood special educators may use
to increase young children's instruc-tional engagement and teach them new skills and
behaviors.  During this project, systematic teaching procedures will be identified and
disseminated through ERIC, journal publications, a state conference presentation and
in
early childhood special education courses at the research university.<P>

<b>The Identification of Educational and Emotional Support Needs for Teen Fathers of
Infants with Special Needs: A Survey of Service Providers for Teen Parents</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to assist service providers in meeting the
needs of teen fathers of infants with disabilities by identifying needs for training,
available services, major obstacles, and current levels of involvement of teen fathers in
caring for their children. <P>
METHOD:  Project staff will begin with a comprehensive mail and telephone survey to
identify agencies which provide support programs for teen parents, including fathers,
with a special focus on programs that provide special programs to meet the parent
training and emotional support needs of this population.  Information gained from a
review of the literature will then be analyzed to develop a survey instrument.  After pilot
testing in Pennsylvania, this survey instrument will be revised and sent to random
agencies from a nationwide list of agencies providing parent training and emotional
support programs for teen parents.  Based on evaluative information gathered from this
nationwide survey, a plan for a model program will be developed.  This model is
expected to consist of a menu of services and approaches to parent training and
emotional support for teen fathers of infants with special needs, and will be reviewed by
at least two agencies prior to finalization.  The final model will draw on the strengths
and
experience of all agencies responding to the survey, and details of the model will be
made available to each identified agency. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to feedback to participating agencies, project
findings will be disseminated through a variety of media.  A presentation abstract will be
prepared and submitted to a national conference on special education, and a brief
summary of project findings will be sent to newsletters for teen parenting and early
intervention programs.  A journal article on project findings will also be submitted to a
peer-reviewed special education journal. <P>

<b>Validation and Field Trial of a Multiple Gating Approach to Preschool Screening for
Behavior Problems </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30017 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This research will assess the psychometric characteristics and validity of a
multiple gating screening procedure designed to identify at-risk preschool children, ages
3 through 5. <P>
METHOD:  Researchers have developed a screening system known as Preschool
Screening for Behavior Problems (PSBP) that uses multiple gating.  Procedures used
by PSBP consist of three interrelated stages cross-validating results.  Stage one
involves preschool teachers ranking students using objective criteria for both
externalizing and internalizing behavior dimensions.  Children identified in this stage are
then targeted for teacher-completed behavior rating measures in the second stage. 
Students exceeding normative criteria on stage two measures pass this gate and are
assessed further on stage three behavioral observation measures.  These direct
observations will be recorded in the classroom.  Six separate studies in the first year will
establish the reliability and validity of the PSBP process.  In the second year
researchers will establish normative databases, cutoff scores, and decision criteria for
stage two rating scales and stage three observational measures.  In year three the
efficacy and social validity of the PSBP will be assessed.  The fourth and final project
year will focus on disseminating results. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will produce systematic, cost-effective
procedures and instruments for the early identification of preschool students exhibiting
behavioral profiles that put them at risk for more severe behavior disorders.  The
validated PSBP will be a psychometrically sound, field tested procedure that can be
easily implemented by preschool personnel.<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will evaluate the effectiveness of child find operations in
Hawaii, what gaps and barriers may be impeding success, and how the child find
component could be strengthened.<P>

METHOD:  Data from recent years will be collected from existing agency records.  In an
effort to identify children "missed" by child find, records will be studied by sampling
approximately 400 of the 4000 children certified eligible each year.  Impact data will be
collected through surveys and interviews.  The coordinating council (HEICC) and the
Evaluation Advisory Group will create initial standards against which to evaluate the
effectiveness of child find.  Interviews, focus groups, and surveys of families, program
staff and administrators will identify gaps and barriers to a more effective child find
program.  Samples of 40 families will be drawn from program records.  A Project
Advisory Group will consider these identified gaps and barriers, and describe ways to
improve policy and practice.  Necessary resources and impacts will be studied with
input from program and families.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Information about Hawaii's process and service utilization
will be summarized in a report that will provide a basis of comparison for other states as

<b>Project VOCABULARY: Understanding Early Growth & Remediation Effects for
Students with Disabilities or At Risk of Reading Failure </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50121 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/14/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will increase understanding of the early vocabulary growth of
children with disabilities or at risk of reading failure; and investigate parsimonious and
efficacious means of remediating vocabulary delay.<P>

METHOD:  Strand I (Measuring and Monitoring Vocabulary Growth) consists of four
studies designed to develop and validate a classroom-based measure of vocabulary to
monitor growth over the critical period of kindergarten and first grade.  The relationship
between early vocabulary growth and reading acquisition will also be examined.  Strand
II (Evaluating the Effects of Strategic Intervention) is comprised of two studies
examining the independent and combined effects of incidental and explicit methods of
vocabulary learning.  This strand of research will further investigate the level and type of
intervention necessary to promote and sustain vocabulary growth in students with
disabilities or at risk of reading failure.  Research will be conducted over a five-year
period.  Two distinct geographic regions will be included to increase the generalizability
of findings.  Twenty-four to thirty kindergarten and first grade teachers will participate in
each year of the project.  Each teacher will nominate four students with learning
disabilities or vocabulary delay and four average achieving students.  Vocabulary
performance will be correlated with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. 
Published norm-referenced tests will be used to assess receptive and expressive
vocabulary.  A classroom-based measure of vocabulary knowledge will be used to
assess the depth and breadth of words sampled from project classrooms.  The
Language Sample Analysis will be used to assess important vocabulary indices emitted
by students during natural speech, including mean length of utterance, number of
different words, and total number of words.  Finally, measures of reading fluency and
comprehension will be used to assess reading achievement.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Outcomes of this project will include: (1) a relevant and
useful measure for gauging vocabulary growth in children with disabilities or vocabulary
delay; (2) more thorough understanding of the vocabulary knowledge of children in
relation to curricular expectations; (3) validated methods to enhance vocabulary growth;
and (4) methods of strengthening and supporting vocabulary growth over time.  These
outcomes will be disseminated through research reports, inservice workshops,
curricular materials, and a classroom-based index of vocabulary growth.  <P>

<b>Efficiency and Efficacy of Phonological Awareness  Instruction for Pre-Readers
At-Risk for Reading Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will extend the research base for children at risk of reading
failure by:  (1) experimentally evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of two instructional
approaches through a combination of formative and summative measures of
phonological awareness; and (2) investigating the developmental appropriateness of
two sizes of phonological units of instruction. <P>
METHOD:  From six kindergarten classrooms in two schools, approximately 150
chidlren will be screened to determine those at risk for reading disabilities. 
Pre-intervention levels of phoneme segmentation ability will be defined with two
standardized normative and formative measures: scores from a standardized phonemic
segmentation instrument; and comparisons of school building segmentation norms and
individual levels of phonemic segmentation.  Children falling below the 25th percentile
in
phonological awareness will be assigned to one of two instructional approaches for ten
weeks of intervention; phonemic segmentation, or onset-time segmentation as a
scaffolded step prior to phonemic segmentation.  A control group of peers will be taught
phonological awareness from current basal curricular materials.  An experimental
design with multiple methodologies will be used including measurements of time to
proficiency, pre/post experimental control, and time series.  Efficiency, the primary
dependent variable, will be measured by comparing the levels in phonemic
segmentation over time to the number of sessions required to achieve proficiency. 
Efficacy will be determined by pre/post comparisons of phonemic segmentation ability
and a phonemic segmentation maintenance test two weeks after intervention. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Primary outcomes from this study will include: (1)
extension of the research base identifying efficient and effective methods for teaching
phonological awareness to prereaders at risk for reading failure; (2) profile analysis of
individual children's responses to phonological awareness instruction through formative
assessment; and (3) professional conference and inservice presentations and journal
articles articulating the relationship between design principles and efficiency, efficacy,
and intensity in phonological awareness instruction for prereaders at risk for reading
failure.<P>

<b>Social Relationship Development in Community Contexts for Young Children with
Severe Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50169 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct research to investigate the social relationships
experienced by young children with severe disabilities. <P> 
METHOD:  The project will undertake a series of studies which will focus on: (1)
demonstrating the efficacy of intensive, longitudinally-applied intervention tactics; (2)
understanding how young typical children's attitudes and behaviors can be made more
facilitative of relationship-building with peers who have disabilities; and (3) determining
how and why consumers adopt and use effective instructional practices in the social
relationship domain.  The first study will provide community-based social relationship
intervention for young children with autism.  Study Two will include a psychometric
study of existing methodology for assessing the presence or absence of preschoolers'
stereotyped views of persons with disabilities in community contexts.  An intervention
study will then aim at maximizing positive and supportive attitudes and behaviors as
expressed by young children, who are not disabled, in community settings.  The third
study will solicit the concerns of potential adopters of intervention plans regarding the
issues, incentives, and disincentives associated with adopting best practices.  This
assessment information will be followed by targeting community providers for adoption
of the interventions developed in the first two studies.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop: (1) empirically based
articles/chapters; (2) conceptual articles/chapters; (3) white papers synthesizing related
policy issues; (4) intervention manuals for direct-line staff; (5) news segments; and (6)
yearly monographs on the state of practice related to relationship-building interventions.

<b>Examining Child Care Providers' Attitudes Toward Substance Exposed Children
and
Their Familes </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50051 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine child-care providers' self-perceived knowledge
and skills, as well as their attitudes toward working with children who have been
exposed to controlled substances and their families.<P>

METHOD:  Two surveys will be employed: Self Rating of Professionals' Knowledge and
Skills and Attitudes Toward Special Populations Survey.  The latter survey will also
assess attitudes toward children with Down syndrome and chronically ill children for
comparison purposes.  These surveys will be administered to 100 child care providers
recruited from public, private religious, and private secular child care settings prior to a
two-hour training session.  The purpose of the training session is to increase providers'
knowledge of the physical, psychosocial, and educational impact of substance
exposure
on infants and toddlers.  It is hypothesized that child care providers' attitudes toward
working with substance-exposed families are poorer than toward working with children
with chronic illness or Down syndrome; it is also hypothesized that these attitudes are
related to self-perceived level of knowledge and skills in working with this population,
and extent of prior training in issues surrounding children with such exposure. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Examining care providers' attitudes toward families with a
history of substance-abuse will be useful in assessing training needs, and in estimating
the effectiveness of such training as a form of intervention, and a change agent in
adjusting providers' attitudes.  Project results will be disseminated to other practitioners
and researchers through publication of articles in scientific journals and through
presentations at national, state, and local conferences. <P>

<b>Specific Language Impairment: Language and Generalization </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40118 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will attempt to gain a better understanding the poor
bound-morpheme acquisition (BMA) of children with specific language impairment (SLI)
in preschool students through a variety of bound-morpheme learning tasks.<P> 
METHOD:  A variety of bound-morpheme learning tasks will be administered to children
with SLI (N=120) and children with normal language development (N=120), 40 each per
project year.  The task variations will be designed to explore the three components of
the BMA process: vocabulary learning, bound-morpheme learning, and
bound-morpheme generalization.  In Project Year 1, the effects of vocabulary learning
on bound-morpheme learning and generalization will be assessed.  In Project Year 2,
the effects of phonological versus semantic enhancements on bound-morpheme
learning and generalization will be examined.  In Project Year 3, the effects on
generalization of reducing vocabulary load as well as emphasizing the affix versus
emphasizing the contrast between affixed and unaffixed forms will be investigated.  In
each of the three project years, a set of associated tasks that assess skills likely to be
pertinent to children's BMA performance will also be administered.  These tasks
investigate sentence memory, nonverbal rule induction, utilization of known
bound-morphemes and phonological and semantic similarity effects.  Statistical
techniques, such as multiple regression analyses, will be used to examine the results of
the bound-morpheme learning task, as well as their relationship to those of the
associated tasks.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The combined results of these studies will clarify whether
theories of storage/access deficits or rule-induction deficits better predict subject-group
differences.  In addition, the results will determine which components of the BMA
process (vocabulary learning, bound-morpheme learning, and/or bound-morpheme
generalization) should be the focus of clinical intervention.<P>

<b>Second Generation Research in Early Intervention: Long-Term Outcomes in
Children and Their Families </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50171 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a second generation research study to examine
the long-term effects of early intervention on children and their families. <P> METHOD: 
This study will involve the long-term follow-up of 300+ children and their families who
participated in the Family, Infant, and Preschool Program (a family-centered model)
between 1981 and 1985. Data on participating children, now between 14 and 16 years
of age, has already been collected.  Multiple regression analyses by sets will be the
principal means of assessing long-term outcomes, and a regression analysis by sets
will
be used to relate several sets of independent variables to the dependent variable of
interest.  Independent variables will include: parent and family characteristics; child
characteristics; social support factors; child diagnosis/development; and intervention
features.  Long term outcomes variables will include: child's social adaptive level;
independent behavior; school achievement; intelligence quotient; school placement;
mainstreaming outcomes; parent well-being, family well-being; level of social support;
parental sense of control over services; and parental satisfaction with services. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This investigation will yield the first long-term follow-up
data on family-centered intervention practices.  A  nontechnical report will be
disseminated to state and federal legislators, State Education Agency (SEA) staff in all
50 states, the administrators of local public school systems and other agencies
responsible for early intervention services.  Findings will also be published in
newsletters serving primarily administrative and policy-making audiences.  In addition,
research findings will be submitted to a variety of journals and conferences serving both
researchers and educators.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H159E50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/30/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine the extent to which Part H is being implemented
at
the local level and examine the relationships between the extent of implementation and
the child and family outcomes achieved.<P>

METHOD:  This study will document the developmental trajectories of 1,800 children in
the first five years of life and examine the relationships between the growth experienced
by children with different disabling conditions and the early intervention services they
receive.  Subjects will represent urban, suburban, and rural communities, including
communities with high proportions of minority group families, in 18 communities located
in 12 states.  Multiple areas of child and family functioning will be measured.  Child and
family outcomes will be assessed when the child enters early intervention and at each
1-year anniversary thereafter until the child reaches 36 months of age.  All children will
be assessed and family outcome data collected at 36 months and again at 60 months. 
Data gathered will address the provider, nature, quantity, quality, and cost of early
intervention services received by each child and family.  The study will also collect
information about the nature of Part H implementation at both community and state
levels.  Information on behavior and services in preschool special education and
kindergarten will be collected as children age and enter new educational settings. 
Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to examine the growth trajectories of children
with different disabilities and to determine the relationship between child growth and
Part H services.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be disseminated to potential
audiences, including policymakers, federal, state, and local administrators, researchers,
practitioners, parents of children with disabilities, advocates, and professional
organizations.  Findings will be disseminated in several formats, including: annual
comprehensive reports at the end of Years 3, 4, and 5; brief reports in each of these
years; short summaries of key findings; articles submitted for publication in professional
journals; and conference presentations and briefings. <P>

<b>Using Instructive Feedback to Promote Future Learning </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023A50013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will evaluate the use of expansion instructive feedback in small
group and low-structure activities and to assess its effects on the efficiency of future
instruction. <P>
METHOD:  Two studies will be conducted using expansion instructive feedback with
between 12 and 20 children with disabilities ages 4 to 8 years.  A parallel treatments
design will be used.  Study 1 will be based in small group instructional contexts, while
Study 2 will focus on low-structure, child-directed activities.  These low-structure
activities may include free play, art, and snack time.  Behaviors to be taught will be
individualized for each child, but will focus mostly on discrete responses from functional
academic and communicative domains.  Two behavior sets will be taught in alternating
daily sessions, one set with and one set without instructive feedback.  In instructional
conditions of both studies, a constant time delay procedure will be used involving
ensuring the child's attention, presenting a stimulus and task direction, using a control
prompt immediately, presenting a short response interval, providing consequences and
instructional feedback, and presenting an inter-trial interval.  Student behavior will be
observed and assessed, and the role of instructional feedback in improving future
instruction will be evaluated. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project staff will submit three manuscripts for publication
in professional literature.  An instructional manual will be developed, evaluated, and
disseminated for preparing teachers to use instructive feedback, and findings will be
submitted to two national conferences.  A fact sheet describing instructive feedback
research will be mailed to a large mailing list of interested practitioners.  Notices
regarding the manual and fact sheet will also be posted on electronic bulletin
boards.<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will compare the effects of combining transition- based
teaching and embedding instruction within activities to each technique as employed
separately. <P>
METHOD:  Two studies will be conducted comparing transition-based teaching and
embedding instruction within activities on children's learning of individualized goals. 
The studies will involve 10-16 children, between 3 and 6 years of age, with disabilities. 
Researchers will employ a parallel treat-ments design.  Students will be taught
behaviors from their individualized education plans (IEPs), and both the rate of their
learning and the extent of their learning will be compared to those of students receiving
only one or the other of the teaching methods being examined. <P> ANTICIPATED

<b>The Effects of a Writing Intervention on the Development of Phonological Skills in
Primary Grade Children with Learning and Reading Disabilities </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50024 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 10/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will provide and evaluate results of instruction emphasizing
both phonological and sound-to-letter skills while students are engaged at a meaningful
task rather than a skill and drill practice task.<P>

METHOD:  Students with learning disabilities in first through third grades (N=16-20) will
be given opportunities to use the writing process as a means of developing both
phonology and letter-sound skills.  Students will write daily in their own journals and will
be encouraged to attend to the phonology of the language system by using invented
spellings for words they cannot spell correctly.  It is expected that students will make
gains in phonological awareness, spelling, and reading skills.  A multiple-probe,
single-subject research design will be employed, and curriculum-based measures in
phonological awareness, spelling, and reading will be taken weekly.  Multiple probe
measures will be graphed to monitor ongoing progress, and will be shared with
students' teachers.  In addition, special education teachers will be interviewed three
times to examine their perceptions about using the writing process as a literacy
intervention. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  An information packet will be developed for dissemination
to special education teachers and teacher trainers.  The packet will provide useful
information about the reading process and will suggest ways to use writing activities to
facilitate development of reading skills.  Samples from study participants' journal
writings and teacher interviews will be featured in the packet.<P>

<b>Generalized, Transitional, and Longitudinal Effects of Prelinguistic Communication
Intervention </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20152 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate effects of prelinguistic communication
intervention on: (1) children's generalized prelinguistic communication skills; (2) parents'
use of behaviors that facilitate children's language development; and (3) children's
language development and linguistic communication.<P>

METHOD:  Sixty children with communication delays who are at risk for related
disabilities will be seen five times over a 2-year period.  Half of the subjects will serve
as
a contrast group, while the other half receives staff-implemented intervention. 
Treatment group subjects will remain in intervention for 6 months or until they meet five
mastery criteria.  Treatment goals include: action and vocal imitation of familiar and
unfamiliar models, participation in social routines, requesting, commenting, and
comprehension and expression of vocabulary that encodes the key word for what the
child was communicating nonverbally.  Intervention techniques will include contingent
imitation, scaffolded modeling, environmental arrangement, and violations of routines.
<P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  If parents in the experimental group use more behaviors
facilitating language development, such findings will support the important bidirectional
assumption of the family-systems approach to intervention and the transactional theory
of development, two theoretical models undergirding Public Law 99-457, Part H. After
determining the effectiveness of intervention, results and validated intervention
procedures will be disseminated to practitioners and researchers.<P>

<b>Activity-Based Assessment: A Functional Approach to Determining Eligibility of
Young Children with Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50028 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the effectiveness and utility of Activity-Based
Assessment for determining eligibility of young children with disabilities for early
intervention services.<P>

METHOD:  The research consists of two studies, each using a mixed factorial design. 
In Study 1, 20 parents of children who are referred to state agencies for evaluation of
eligibility for early childhood special education programs will be selected as subjects. 
This study will examine (1) the functionality of test items as measured by parents using
the Functional Skills Checklist (FSC), and (2) parental satisfaction with their role and
involvement in the assessment process as measured by a Parental Satisfaction
Questionnaire.  Study 2 will select 20 early interventionists as subjects, and will
examine
(1) the functionality of test items as measured by early interventionists using the FSC
and (2) the degree of linkage between eligibility assessment information of the Activity
Based Assessment and intervention programming versus a traditional assessment
measure using the Intervention Linkage Checklist.  This study will be designed for
replication to further define effects of the alternative eligibility assessment procedure
with different subjects, locations, and test comparisons.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project plans to complete the following dissemination
activities: presentations at professional conferences and university seminars, journal
publications, monographs and administration manuals, and inservice technical
