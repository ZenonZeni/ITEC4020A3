<B>Research Projects</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>The Morris W. Stroud III Program on Scientific Approaches to Quality of Life in Health and Aging</B>  This program is supported by a bequest from the late Dr. Stroud, a pioneer in rehabilitation medicine. Drs. Barry Gurland and Sidney Katz (Professor Emeritus of Geriatric Medicine at Columbia) are Co-Directors. An important theme of this program deals with changes in qualities of life accompanying mental health problems in aging. Related secondary analyses of data sets from the Center's major collaborative studies, the North Manhattan Aging Project, Active Life Expectancy Study, and Growing Older in New York City survey, have been supported by this program, leading to better understanding of the relative usefulness of competing concepts of dementia and depression for predicting problems in the quality of everyday living and demands on services. Ethno-racial comparisons revealed that substantial differences between Latinos, African-Americans, and Non-Latino Whites in rates of dementia and depression could be linked to corresponding impacts on qualities of life. The laptop computer-assisted interview covering qualities of life, developed by Dr. Jiming Chen, has now been administered to over 2,500 elders in their homes. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Stroud Program continued formal mentorship and partial support for Dr. Zachary Pine's Career Development Award to develop objective measures for assessing impairments of functioning in dementia, and to investigate affective responses to disability. The Program also continued mentorship of Dr. Terry Fulmer's National Brookdale Fellowship in finding objective measures of the match between capacity for independence and permitted autonomy in elders with mental disorders. With Dr. Steven Albert of the Sergievsky Center, the Stroud Program delivered a course on health related qualities of life, thus initiating the first formal curriculum in this field. Corresponding content has been inserted in the offerings of the Geriatric Education Center.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>North Manhattan Aging Project (NMAP)</B>  (Barry Gurland, M.D., Principal Investigator, and David Wilder, Ph.D., Co-Principal Investigator). NMAP was renewed for a second five-year period as part of the Program Project (Epidemiology of Dementia in an Urban Community) funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and conducted in collaboration with Drs. Richard Mayeux and Yaakov Stern of the Sergievsky Center and Psychiatric Institute. During the first five years, a case registry was established to identify and assess all cases of Alzheimer's and related dementias in the area of North Manhattan bounded by 155th Street to the south, 181st Street to the north, and by the Hudson and Harlem rivers, so that cross-cultural epidemiologic comparisons can be made among elderly Latino, African-American and Non-Latino White residents. A case reporting component of the registry occupied the first three years of the study and has been followed by a survey component. Each component evaluated over 2,000 of the target area elders. Prevalence of dementia among elders aged 65 and older was estimated from the case reporting component using thirteen different case definitions. Larger estimates resulted from the survey component, which was more successful than the reporting component in identifying early stage dementias in the community. Higher rates were found among Latinos and African-Americans than Non-Latino Whites in both registry components. Separate multiple regression analyses of the case reporting and survey component samples both showed age and education to be significantly related to rates of dementia, but neither gender nor ethnic/race, was significantly related when age and education were controlled. The continuation award maintains the collaboration with the Sergievsky Center and includes a study of the function/quality complex in borderzone cognitive impairment (Dr. Barry Gurland, Principal Investigator) and the survey and assessment core (Dr. David Wilder, Principal Investigator).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Jeanne Teresi has led the statistical strategies, based on her work on item response theory, for deriving culture-fair scales for assessment of cognitive impairment. Ms. Eloise Killeffer has worked to effect closure on the informant interview sector of the North Manhattan Aging Project (963 completed interviews and a better than 90% response rate). These informant data have refined the distinguishing features of early dementia, its consequences for patient and family, and the estimation of service needs and fulfillment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Active Life Expectancy Among Urban Minority Elders</B>  With Dr. Rafael Lantigua, Principal Investigator, Dr. David Wilder, Co-Principal Investigator, and Drs. Barry Gurland and Sidney Katz, Co-Investigators, this project began the fourth year of a five-year study of transitions in function among elders in North Manhattan. It is funded by the National Institute on Aging, in collaboration with the Division of General Medicine and the Sergievsky Center, and coordinated with the North Manhattan Aging Project and the Stroud Program. Initial bilingual (Spanish and English) interviews were completed with a probability sample of over 2,100 community elders in their homes, and informant interviews and examinations by physicians were conducted for large subsamples (n=948 and 1,178 respectively). First follow-up assessments are currently underway, and second follow-ups are scheduled for the fifth year of the study. Cross-sectional analysis has included ethno-racial comparisons of disability and accompanying depression, development and refining of quality of life measures, and comparing informant and subject reports of functioning with performance test results.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Quality of Life and Care of Elders in New York City</B>  Analyses continue on data from this study of 1,570 older New Yorkers, which was conducted in collaboration with the New York Community Trust Center for Policy on Aging and the Fordham University Third Age Center. Dr. Barry Gurland is the Principal Investigator of this study, and Dr. Cathy Berkman is the <BR>
Co-Principal Investigator. With special emphasis on the very old and minority persons (African-American and Latino), the study focused on functional impairment, depression, and cognitive impairment. A report on the study was disseminated in 1993-94 among planning agencies by the New York Community Trust. Data analysis is now focused on the relationship between economic status, depression, and disability, and other aspects of quality of life in the elderly. Analyses in 1994 showed that rates of chronic physical and mental illness are highly related to income even in the middle income ranges. A comparison of cognitive impairment observed in the recent 1990 study and in our previous 1975 survey, indicate that prevalence of dementia may have increased over this period of time.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Laboratory for Investigation of Objective Functioning</B>  Under the direction of Dr. Zachary Pine, a physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, a laboratory has been established for the investigation of neural and physiological mechanisms underlying impaired function in the tasks of daily living. This work is supported by a Federal Individual Physician Scientist Career Development Award, with clinical mentoring provided by Dr. Barry Gurland. Techniques have been developed and piloted for measuring impairments in vision, strength, sensation, and joint range of motion. Performance measures of integrated tasks such as ambulation and reaching for objects are also employed. Brain strategies underlying reaching tasks are being analyzed using computer-based motion tracking. The technique employs miniature electromagnetic sensors, and is designed for portability. This new and mobile system of investigation will focus upon early changes in functioning in dementia, which may be subclinical.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment in Health and Aging Seminar</B>  This seminar is sponsored by the Stroud Program as part of an effort to foster quality of life research, including its applications to mental health and disorders. Taught jointly by Dr. Steven Albert and Dr. Barry Gurland, the course offers a state-of-the-art assessment of quality of life (QoL) inquiry. The course is offered through the School of Public Health at Columbia University for the spring semester. The following topics are covered as part of the seminar: health utility measurements, assessment in special populations, applications to quality assurance, medical technology, policy analysis, and related topics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>New York Statewide Psychogeriatric Program</B>  This program is co-directed by Drs. John Toner and Barry Gurland, and supported by the New York State Office of Mental Health. It consists of two major components-education and research-organized around a geriatric psychiatry fellowship at Willard Psychiatric Center and Binghamton Psychiatric Center, both in upstate New York. The program focuses on preparing psychiatrists in the practice of geriatric psychiatry related to the transition of the public mental health system from a concentration on inpatients to integrated hospital and community mental health sites of service. The research is conducted by faculty-fellow partnerships working on the knowledge base underlying the development and implementation of innovative clinical modules. Current research activities include: a cross-national collaborative project on community reinvestment in New York State and the United Kingdom; a 25-year follow-up of the 1968-69 US-UK Cross National Diagnostic Study cohort; and studies of the diagnosis of dementia in the non-communicating elderly, the development of a scale for delusional depression, the effects of DNR on nursing home staff behaviors, causes of agitated behaviors in dementia, psychiatric differences between vascular and organic brain disorders, and a 10-year retrospective autopsy study of cerebral arteriosclerosis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Research Training and Information Transfer (RTIT)</B>  The RTIT Core of the Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research (Dr. Michael Shelanski, Principal Investigator) is now in the first year of its five-year renewal (1994-99) under Dr. Barry Gurland, Principal Investigator, and Dr. Ruth Bennett, Project Director. Content on Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be integrated into a course entitled "Long Term Care with an Emphasis on AD," offered within the School of Public Health. A new mini-residency was designed by Dr. Virginia Barrett, entitled "The Effect of Information on Quality of Life of Elders with Dementia and Their Families." A program of transfer of information to community advocates was initiated under Dr. Jiming Chen and Aline Ratau and entitled "Community Empowerment through Research Information." This involves the communication of relevant research information about North Manhattan elders to community agencies serving these elders. Co-sponsorship of events included the Alzheimer Information Day at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center on December 7, 1994.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Organization and Effectiveness of Home-Delivered Services to Elders</B>  In 1994, this became a new focus of research under the leadership of Peter Cross with Dr. Jeanne Teresi and Eloise Killeffer. Such services-most notably, personal care services-have been among the most rapidly growing health services, swelling to over a billion dollars a year of public money in New York City alone. Of special interest is the articulation of home-based services with mental health and general medical services. This new thrust was inaugurated in a Stroud Distinguished Lecture by Dr. Morton Kramer in May 1993. Preliminary work has included a secondary analysis of data from the North Manhattan Aging Project on home care recipients to examine putative home care eligibility criteria, submitted as a contract report to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and a report on possible reforms of home care, submitted to the New York State Department of Health. Ongoing studies of home care are planned for the Upper West Side of Manhattan, an area with a high rate and number of home-care recipients. Home-care utilization data for this area has been obtained and analyzed preliminary to submission for funding of a large longitudinal study of the home-care population with special focus on their mental health problems and use of mental health services.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This project is a new three-year initiative under the direction of Dr. Terry Fulmer, with Co-directors Drs. Barry Gurland and Rafael Lantigua from Columbia University, Dr. Mathy Mezey from New York University, and Dr. Robert Kennedy from Beth Abraham Hospital. Funded by the Federal Bureau of Health Professions, it is a consortium of three institutions providing a five-day certificate program in interdisciplinary geriatric training to a wide range of professionals throughout New York State. It includes three days of core activities on geriatric assessment, multiculturalism, elder abuse, long-term care, nutrition, bioethics, Alzheimer's disease, and quality of life. In addition there are two days of intensive work in a choice of specialty modules on any core topic of geropsychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, occupational and physical therapy, dentistry, social work, and nursing. Full day conferences provide additional opportunities for learning. The interdisciplinary and multi-cultural focus provides professionals with the most up-to-date material available. The train-the-trainer approach with a short term intensive learning experience promotes leadership with the enthusiasm to institute change and to improve the quality of health care the elderly.

<B>Community Outreach Education on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in <BR>
North Manhattan and Harlem</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) for the period 1992-95 (Dr. Ruth Bennett, Principal Investigator) this project continued its regional AD outreach education work. A brochure describing all programs and services related to AD continues to be circulated. The North Manhattan Community Information Center on Memory Loss, an AD resource center funded by this grant at the Fort Washington Houses and Services for the Elderly, has reached over 50 community service organizations including churches and senior centers in Harlem and North Manhattan, which have received talks from Center bilingual outreach workers. Initial requests are highest for respite and support services.
