O.K.  You've got a rather long day in the saddle today. There are more hills to climb. It could get hot. Massage appointments will fill up fast. But remember, at least you've got rest stops, sag wagons, delicious meals, hot showers and a beer garden on hand at various points on the course. If you had been one of the early pioneers who came out on the Oregon Trail, it would have been a whole different story. So when you visit the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, location of our lunch this day, remember to keep things in perspective. Inside the Center, living history demonstrations, life sized dioramas, numerous displays and exhibits pay tribute to the courage of the emigrants and the hardship of the Oregon Trail. (Note: when entering the Center, please check cleats and water bottles at the door.) Our lunch is being hosted by the Baker County Visitor and Convention Bureau.
<p>
Continuing on, we ride through historic Baker City, one of few Western cities whose ornate turn-of-the-century architecture is still intact. Tucked against the dramatic backdrop of the Elkhorn Mountains, this "Queen City of the Mines," as it used to be called, was a booming mining community near the turn of the century.
<P>
Sumpter, our overnight destination, was also a booming mining community and as recently as 1957 their gold dredge was still operating. Today, the dredge can still be viewed at the State Park located at the edge of town and the original narrow gauge steam locomotive from Sumpter still operates. During our stay, mining and logging demonstrations will take place. Check out the antique shops or witness the "pony express" in action.
