SPEECHTEK DEVLOPERS CONFERENCE DRAWS MORE THAN 700 ATTENDEES

Speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis, two emerging
technologies now-bringing "killer applications" to market as
they change the way humans and machines interact, were the
focal points of the SpeechTEK 95 Developers Conference held in
Boston recently.

The goal of most speech technology is to create completely
natural interfaces between people and the machines they use,
replacing cumbersome keyboards, awkward telephone keypads and
making a wide range of consumer products easier to use. One
example, Wildfire, screens, routes and announces incoming
calls for mobile professionals. Other applications include
voice dialing for cellular car phones, allowing drivers to
keep both hands on the wheel.

Attendees at SpeechTEK 95 had a chance to explore the world
of advanced speech technology by viewing live demonstrations
of existing products; hearing presentations from senior
executives of leading speech recognition companies and
attending issue-orientated workshops.

Peter J. Foster, president and CEO of Voice Control Systems,
informed the crowd that after a decade that featured market
research projections of a billion dollar market, speech
technology has now begun to develop "killer applications."
Alan G. O'Dacre, assistant vice president for business line
management and engineering at Nortel showed how the public
telephone network has been transformed by the use of voice
technologies and how they will become dramatically easier ill
the near future. Walt Tetschner, president of Tern Systems and
a renown industry consultant, predicted that the various
market segments of speech technology would enjoy strong growth
in the near future, with most seeing 20% and 30% growth rates
through 1998. John Oberteuffer, publisher of ASR News, an
industry newsletter, moderated a panel which updated attendees
on efforts to develop API (Application Programming Interface)
standards.

Another sign of industry growth was the recent launch of
Speech Technology magazine, the first publication devoted
entirely to applied speech technology. This year's conference,
SpeechTEK '96, is scheduled for Sept. 30 through Oct. 2 in
New York.

Comtek International, Inc. which produced and managed
SpeechTEK, is a company that produces about 20 trade shows a
year, many in the former Soviet Union.  Founded in 1990, the
firm employs about 50 people at its headquarters, 43 Danbury
Rd., Wilton, CT 06897.

SPEECH TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE PUBLISHES FIRST EDITION

Speech Technology magazine, the first publication devoted
solely to the rapidly emerging technologies that are changing
how machines and humans interact, published its first edition
recently.

The magazine examines how speech recognition software, once
thought to be only the stuff of science fiction movies, is
available here and now, and for uses far beyond the computer.
"Very soon, we will be talking to our cars and television
sets, and they will be talking back," said Brian Lewis, editor
of the quarterly publication. readers are the users and
evaluators of this technology -- the next wave of innovators
who are putting this exciting technology to practical use.
They are the people defining an industry that will shape the
way the world works and plays," he added. The magazine was
first available at SpeechTEK '95, a conference for speech
technology developers held in Boston.

The premier edition featured articles on a variety of speech
recognition issues. The articles included how speech should
become the natural interface for public telephone network
services, the advent of "no hands" dialing for cellular car
phones and the speech recognition problems caused by different
dialects. The magazine also featured detailed market forecasts
for the various segments of the automatic speech recognition
and text-to-speech markets and a review of the factors
involved in the development of API (application program
interface) standards.

Filling an Industry Void

Despite the fact that voice recognition and speech synthesis
have become hot industry topics for many business and
technical publications, users have long had to glean
information from publications that had only a casual interest
in the topic. "Speech Technology fills a long standing void in
the industry," said Lewis. "We were surprised to find that no
other national publication focused on speech. The timing, the
technology and the market conditions all seemed right to
launch the magazine at this time."

CI Publishing is a division of Comtek International, Inc.,
which produced and managed SpeechTEK.
