<img src="wavy.gif"><p>
We, ________________________ and _______________________ being husband and wife, voluntarily give
our consent and authorize, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces
Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns and the IVF program personnel
and associates to perform In Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET), and the procedures necessary for
IVF-ET.  <p>

We understand that the sperm used in these procedures and referred to in this consent form will be obtained
from (Circle appropriate source) 
<ul>
<li>The husband
<li>An anonymous donor
<li>A known donor
</ul>
<p>
If we have requested donor semen (semen from another person) to be used to fertilize the egg(s), my
husband and I will each sign a separate document to indicate our decision and acceptance of that
option, and we will also indicate our decision for donor semen by initialing
here:______________________ (initials of husband and wife)<p>

If donor sperm is selected (Circle appropriate choice) <p>
<ul>
<li>Use only donor sperm.
<li>Divide the eggs between donor sperm and husbands sperm.  ___%donor;      ___% husband
(selection of which sperm sample used for each egg will be at the discretion of the embryologist.)
<li>If in the embryologist's opinion, the husband's sperm specimen is not likely to result in fertilization,
use donor sperm.  
<li>If no fertilization on first day using the husband's sperm, reinseminate  with donor sperm.
</ul><p>
<b>PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES</b><br>
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a means for us to achieve pregnancy when conventional therapy
has failed or is unacceptable. Surgical and/or medical therapy has been tried with adequate periods of follow-
up for pregnancy to occur after thorough evaluation of coital, male, cervical, ovulatory, ovarian, uterine, tubal
and peritoneal factors.<p>

<b>REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION</b><br>
We understand that the following are requirements for participation in this procedure and we represent that we
meet each of the requirements.<p>

<ul>
<li>We are legally married.
<li>We have a history of infertility from female or male factors or an unknown cause.
</ul><p>
We acknowledge and agree that our acceptance into the program and our continuing participation is at the
discretion of the staff of the program.  Correspondingly, we understand that we can withdraw from the program
at any time without affecting the availability of other present or future medical care.<p>
  
We understand that insurance coverage for any or all of the above procedures may not be available. We
acknowledge that we have been made aware of our financial obligations and we have made appropriate
financial arrangements and understand we are responsible for payments on services performed regardless of
whether a pregnancy is achieved.  We also understand that we are financially responsible for any other
medical costs incurred through Georgia Baptist Medical Center or Paces Cryobank. <p>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES</b><br>
We understand the IVF-ET procedure involves the removal of egg(s) from the wife's ovary(ies) by a needle
and the fertilization of those eggs with the husband's/donor's sperm in the laboratory.  The fertilized egg(s) will
be cultured in a laboratory environment for approximately two days and then transferred to the wife's uterus.  <p>

We consent to the following surgical, medical, and/or diagnostic procedures:<p>

<b>Pre-IVF screening:</b> Determination by medical history, physical examination, and standard infertility tests
that we are candidates for this procedure;<br>
<b>Ovulation Induction:</b> The use of fertility drugs (usually Lupron, Pergonal, Metrodin and human chorionic
gonadotropin (HCG)) to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles (eggs) in the ovary;<br>
<b>Laboratory tests:</b> Frequent blood samples will be taken from the woman to monitor hormone secretions
from the ovary and pituitary gland;<br>
<b>Ultrasound:</b> Ultrasonography is a diagnostic procedure using sound waves to provide a picture of the
ovaries and the follicles to monitor the development of the egg(s);<br>
<b>Egg retrieval:</b> Vaginal introduction of a needle into the ovary to obtain one or more eggs.  This is
performed with ultrasound guidance.  A local anesthetic and pain medication is used to minimize
discomfort.<br>
<b>Semen Specimen:</b> Collection of a semen specimen (by masturbation) or the thawing of donor semen and
laboratory treatment of the specimen to prepare it for fertilization; <br>
<b>Fertilization:</b> Placing the egg(s) and the sperm together in a suitable medium to allow fertilization; If there
is no evidence of fertilization after 72 hours of incubation, the oocytes (incompletely developed eggs) and
sperm will be disposed of in an ethically-acceptable manner.<br>
<b> Micromanipulation:</b> A procedure where either a few sperm are injected beneath the outer layer of the
egg(s) or directly into the egg(s) to increase the possibility of fertilization.<br>
<b>Embryo Culture:</b> Development of the fertilized egg(s) and pre-embryo formation;<br>
<b>Embryo transfer:</b> Placement of the embryo(s) into the uterus by means of a small plastic tube inserted
through the cervix into the uterus;<br>
<b>Assisted Hatching</b>: A slit is made in the outer protective layer surrounding the fertilized egg(s) to remove
fragments and to increase the possibility of implantation;<br>
<b>Cryopreservation: </b>If there are more pre-embryos than can be safely transferred, excess pre-embryos can
be cryopreserved, donated, or discarded.  Alternatively, the physician and the couple may elect to limit the
number of follicles aspirated.<br>
<b>Luteal Phase Support:</b> During the first two weeks after embryo transfer, additional hormonal support,
Progesterone or HCG, may be administered in the form of tablets, injections or suppositories;<br>
<b>Pregnancy testing:</b> Following transfer of embryo(s) blood tests may be obtained to insure normal hormone
levels and to detect pregnancy.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the wife will proceed with obstetrical care
through a physician of her choice, upon release from care of the IVF team.<p>

<b>MICROMANIPULATION</b><br>
Micromanipulation is used either to enhance fertilization, or  alternatively, it may be utilized to increase the
chances that the pre-embryo(s) will attach to the uterus.  Microfertilization is performed immediately after the
oocytes (eggs) are retrieved, or the following day if fertilization is not confirmed.  To enhance fertilization, the
embryologist will choose between three different types of micromanipulation procedures; PZD involves slicing
a hole in the zona pellucida or "shell" of the egg; SZI involves placing 2-4 sperm beneath this outer layer just
ajacent to the inner egg membrane; ICSI, direct injection of the sperm into the egg. Each of these procedures
may be chosen based on a number of factors.   No one procedure is appropriate for everyone.  Therefore, the
embryologist will individualize treatment and will decide whether to perform micromanipulation and which
procedure to use at his discretion.<p>

Fertilization rates with micromanipulation may vary between 20% and 50%.  There is also no guarantee
that any of the eggs undergoing micromanipulation may fertilize or implant.  Repeat IVF with other
modifications may result in similar fertilization rates.  Failure of the egg to fertilize and divide may be related to
the stress of micromanipulation, egg injury or fertilization with more than one sperm.  There is no way to know
which are the best sperm to choose for injection.  This may result in the selection of chromosomally abnormal
sperm.  Early reports have suggested that the incidence of major chromosomal anomalies is increased 2-4
times in patients undergoing micromanipulation.  Prenatal genetic diagnosis of all resultant pregnancies is
strongly recommended.  In addition, the incidence of identical twins may be increased.<p>

If the fertilized egg demonstrates increased fragments, micromanipulation and removal of fragments may
enhance attachment to the uterus.  In older patients, those with borderline FSH levels,  previous IVF failures or
a thick outer layer (zona),  assisted hatching may be recommended. <p> 

I understand that these procedures are new and all potential complications resulting from micromanipulation
may not yet be known.  I understand that neither Dr. Perloe, Dr. Pyrzak, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre,
Paces Cryobank or Georgia Baptist Medical Center or their designees have warranted the success of this
procedure or the health of any child developing from such a procedure.  I consent to any or all of the
procedures described aboveand indicated below: The necessity of these procedures will be determined by the
MD and embryologist during the treatment cycle.  Choosing one of these options does not guarantee that any
of them will be performed.  (husband & wife signify consent by initialing each procedure and signing below.)<p>

	<dd>______subzonal insertion		
	<dd>______intracytoplasmic sperm  injection<p>		
		
	<dd>______assisted hatching	<p>	
<b>
SUCCESS RATE</b><br>
From the information currently available, we understand that the chances of obtaining a pregnancy by this
procedures is between 20% and 30%.  We have discussed our particular fertility factors and chances for
success with our physician.  We acknowledge, agree and understand that neither the Atlanta Reproductive
Health Centre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, and the IVF program
personnel and associates have made any promises or warranties regarding the success rate or results of In
Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer or the health and characteristics of any child or children that may be
conceived by the procedure.  Because IVF-ET is a relatively new procedure, insufficient data are available to
express an exact success rate.  <p>
Failure to achieve a pregnancy may result from any of the following or from other reasons:<p>

<menu>
<li>Maturation of the egg(s) may not occur, or the time of egg maturation may be misjudged, may not be
predictable, may occur prior to egg retrieval or may not take place in the monitored cycle.<br>
<li>The procedure to obtain all or a number of eggs from the wife's ovary may not be successful.<br>
<li>Medical emergencies with other patients may restrict availability of the procedure room or the necessary
personnel at the appropriate time for obtaining the egg(s).<br>
<li>The egg(s) obtained from the wife may not be normal.<br>
<li>The husband may be unable to provide a suitable semen specimen, or if used, the donor semen
specimen may not have an adequate number of viable sperm after freezing and thawing. <br>
<li>Fertilization of the egg(s) by the sperm may not occur.<br>
<li>Egg(s) may not survive the micromanipulation process. <br>
<li>Cleavage or cell division of the embryo(s) may not occur or the embryo(s) may not develop normally.<br>
<li>The embryo(s) may become infected in the laboratory or a laboratory accident or equipment malfunction
may result in loss or damage to the eggs, sperm, or embryo(s).<br>
<li>Transfer of the embryo may not be successful.<br>
<li>Implantation of the embryo(s) in the uterus after embryo transfer or gamete transfer may not occur.<br>
<li>Even if a pregnancy is established, we understand that delivery of a child may not occur due to
miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus), stillbirth, or other complications associated with
pregnancy and delivery. <p>

<b>POSSIBLE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IVF-ET</b><br>
Potential fertility drug side effects: Along with their intended benefits, fertility drugs have a potential to cause
side effects.  The most common side effect is increased stimulation of the ovary.  Occasionally, ovarian
enlargement with symptoms of abdominal discomfort can occur.  Mild to moderate uncomplicated ovarian
enlargement, sometimes accompanied by abdominal distension and/or abdominal pain occurs in about 20%
of those treated with Pergonal, Metrodin and HCG.  This is generally reversed without treatment within 2-3
weeks.<p>

Severe ovarian enlargement, known as the hyperstimulation syndrome is characterized by sudden
enlargement of the ovary and an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.  This fluid can also accumulate around
the lungs and may cause breathing difficulties.  If the ovary ruptures, blood can accumulate in the abdominal
cavity, as well.  The fluid imbalance can also affect blood clotting and could be life-threatening.  Fortunately,
the hyperstimulation syndrome occurs in only about 1.3% of patients.  Treatment consists of bed rest and
careful monitoring of fluid levels.  <p>

Other adverse reactions that have been reported with Pergonal, Metrodin, HCG or Lupron are: allergic
sensitivity, pain, rash, swelling at the injection site, and ectopic pregnancy.  Adverse reactions have also been
reported with HCG and include: headache, irritability, restlessness, depression, and fatigue.  Patients taking
Lupron may experience hot flashes.  We understand that we should report symptoms to our physician
immediately.  Recent studies have suggested that fertility medication may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. 
However, these studies involve a small number of patients and the results are not well accepted.  I have had
an opportunity to discuss my concerns with my physician. <p>

Blood tests may cause mild discomfort and a risk of developing a bruise or an infection at the needle site. 
Discomfort may be caused by ultrasound procedures.  <p>

From the ultrasound needle aspiration, there is a possibility of bleeding, infection or injury to the bladder or
abdominal organs that may require immediate or later major surgery.  Infection may further impair fertility or
result in a loss of fertility potential.<p>

Transferring the embryo into the uterus may cause discomfort and a risk of developing infection or bleeding. 
In addition, there is the possibility that the early embryo(s) may implant into a fallopian tube causing an ectopic
(tubal) pregnancy that usually requires surgical treatment.  <p>

Some women have experienced multiple pregnancies after multiple embryos were transferred.  The risk for
multiple pregnancies after transferring three embryos is 27% for twins and 3% for triplets.  <p>

Multiple pregnancies (twins or more) carry higher than normal risks for the mother due to extra fetuses and
may be associated with emotional and financial strain for the family, and prolonged hospitalization of the
mother before the birth and after birth for both the mother and infants.  <p>

Mothers are at higher risk for high blood pressure, miscarriage, premature labor and delivery and other
pregnancy complications.  Both the number of neonatal deaths and the number of long term handicaps are
several times more frequent in multiple pregnancies than in single born infants.  This results primarily from
premature delivery.<p>

Triplet pregnancy (as well as quadruplets and quintuplets) increase the risk that delivery will be much too soon
for survival of the infants.  A procedure known as selective reduction may be considered in cases where three
or more gestational sacs are seen.  More information about this procedure is available on a personal basis. 

General anesthesia involves the use of an anesthetic for the prevention of pain.  Certain complications may
result from the use of any anesthetic.  These include: respiratory problems, drug reactions, paralysis, brain
damage, or even death.  Other risks range from minor discomforts, to injury of the vocal cords, teeth, or eyes. 
The risks associated with local anesthesia and IV sedation are greatly reduced.<p>

The Food and Drug Administration has advised that progesterone use should be avoided during pregnancy. 
Synthetic progesterones have been reported to increase the risk of congenital heart malformations from 8 in
10,000 births to 15 in 10,000 births.  Additional abnormalities reported include: anal blockage, abnormalities of
bones, brain, spinal cord, vertebrae, kidney, esophagus and sex organs.  The progesterone injections that the
wife will receive are made from natural progesterone and are chemically different from the synthetic
progesterone resulting in the small risk of increased abnormalities noted above.  The natural progesterone
injections are identical to that made by the woman's own body and therefore is unlikely to cause any bad
effects to the woman or a baby if the woman becomes pregnant while using this medication.<p>

It is possible that a fetus conceived by IVF-ET could develop some abnormality.  Three out of 100 births from
spontaneous conception in fertile couples have some type of birth defect and this rate appears to be similar in
births from IVF-ET.  There are a few studies suggesting that pregnancies resulting micromanipulation
techniques such as partial zona dissection (PZD), subzonal insertion (SZI) or intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI)
may be at greater risk for congenital abnormalities.  These findings have not been confirmed by other
investigators.  Such abnormalities may not always result in miscarriage or be detectable by prenatal tests. 
Although amniocentesis and/or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed to analyze fetal cells for
chromosomal abnormalities, some defects cannot be determined by this or other tests; it is possible that an
abnormal child could be born as a result of IVF-ET.  CVS is available at 9-11 weeks gestation and
amniocentesis is available for pregnant patients at 14-16 weeks of gestation.  <p>

We understand that these are new clinical procedures and that it is possible that there may as yet be unknown
risks related to pregnancy achieved by this method, or to the mental or physical health of any children so
produced.  We, therefore, do jointly and severally release and forever discharge Atlanta Reproductive Health
Centre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees,
successors, and assigns and the IVF program personnel from any and all claims, demands, costs, expenses
and loss of services incurred as a result of the physical or mental nature or character of any child or children
so produced.  <p>
<b>
ALTERNATE FORMS OF TREATMENT</b><br>
We understand that if we choose not to proceed with IVF-ET, the chances of our obtaining a pregnancy at this
time are low or nonexistent.  All other possible alternative procedures to enable pregnancy to occur have been
explained, offered, or attempted.  We understand, however, that medical technology is constantly evolving
and developments may take place in the future which might allow us to obtain a pregnancy.  We also
understand that adoption through other resources may be available to us.  <p>

<b>TREATMENT DECISIONS</b><br>
We understand that all decisions regarding each step of the procedure involved, including fertilization and
implantation, will be made by our IVF physician based on his independent medical judgment.  We understand
that our IVF physician may decide not to proceed with the procedures because of complications or possible
risks, either to the husband, wife or to the potential child, or because of other reasons and we agree to rely on
his decisions in this regard.<p>

<b>LEGAL STATUS</b><br>
We understand that due to the relatively new nature of IVF-ET, many legal issues surrounding the procedure
have not been resolved and the legal status of any resulting child in terms of legitimacy or otherwise is
uncertain.  It is our intent and understanding that any resulting child be our legitimate child and we accept legal
custody and responsibility for any child or children we may have as a result of this procedure.  <p>

We, jointly and severally, accept the in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer as our own act and acknowledge
the child or children so produced as our own legitimate child or children and as the heir or heirs of our bodies
with all the rights and privileges accompanying such status.  We jointly and severally waive forever any right
which we might have to disclaim such child or children as our heir(s).  <p>

<b>MEDICAL EXPENSES</b><br>
We have been informed that if we should suffer any physical injury as a result of participation in this activity, all
of the necessary medical facilities are available for treatment.  We understand, however, that we cannot
expect to receive any payment for hospital expenses or any financial compensation for such an injury.<p>

<b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b><br>
We understand that the physician and his associates will, unless otherwise compelled by law, make all
reasonable efforts to keep information obtained about us during the course of treatment confidential.  We
agree that specific medical details may be revealed in professional publications as long as our confidentiality is
maintained.  We also authorize the filming, videotaping,  and/or photographing of the female reproductive
organs during the course of the procedure.  <p>
<b>LIMITING MULTIPLE PREGNANCY</b><br>
We have been informed of the risks of multiple pregnancy.  After discussion of the risks of multiple pregnancy,
my husband and I have decided to have:  (choose one or specify maximum with number to be determined by
physician/embryologist)<p>
  A maximum of  ________ (number of pre-embryos) placed into my uterus.  <p>

  A number to be determined by the physician and the embryologist immediately prior to pre-embryo
transfer so as to maximize the possibility of pregnancy and minimize the risk of multiple gestation.  We
understand that a scoring system will be used to grade pre-embryo quality to indicate the number of pre-
embryos to transfer.  There is no guarantee that this technique will successfully limit the chance of
multiple gestations.  _____________________ (initials of husband and wife)  <p>
We have been informed and understand that if we wish to cryopreserve (freeze) any fertilized eggs not
transferred to the uterus, we will be required to sign a separate consent document.  We have been informed
and understand that if we, as husband and wife, cannot agree or do not consent to either the freezing of
fertilized eggs or donation, we must either limit the number of eggs to be inseminated to the same number that
are to be transferred to the Wife's uterus or agree to disposal of extra fertilized eggs.   If excess pre-embryos
are not cryopreserved our chance of achieving a pregnancy may ultimately be decreased.<p>

 (Choose one option.) <p>
 	<i><ul>
<li>We consent to cryopreserve extra pre-embryos.  We understand that if for any given pre-embryo the
quality is not sufficient to make survival likely, cryopreservation will not be performed on that pre-embryo and it
will be disposed of.. The decision whether to perform cryopreservation will be that of the medical team.
(separate cryopreservation consent required) _____________________ (initials of husband and wife)  <p>

<li> 	We do not wish to have any pre-embryos cryopreserved and consent to:<p> 
<dd>The disposal of any non transferred pre-embryos.  _____________________   (initials of husband and wife)  
<dd>Donation of extra pre-embryos. (separate consent required) <p>

<li>  	We here indicate our decision for only ______________ (number of eggs/all) to be inseminated (mixed with sperm) _________________  (initials of husband and wife)  
</ul></i><p>

We hereby knowingly and voluntarily release the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Mark Perloe, M.D.
