<h2>Executive Summary </h2>

<hr>

<ol>
    <li>A study was designed to examine the effects of marijuana
        and alcohol when taken alone and in combination on human
        skills performance and mood. </li>
    <li>Four dosage conditions were employed for each drug
        (placebo and three active doses). All possible
        combinations of these dosage conditions were tested (ie
        16 dosage groups). </li>
    <li>Twenty subjects were used for each dosage group, the
        experiment employing 320 subjects in all. Each subject
        attended the laboratory on one occasion only. </li>
    <li>Data collected were for psychomotor performance using a
        battery of computer-presented tests, mood effects,
        subjective assessments of the nature and degree of
        intoxication, and the subjective assessment of the
        effects of the drugs on driving skills and willingness to
        drive a motor vehicle. </li>
    <li>The performance battery included tests of human skills
        related to those considered necessary to drive a motor
        vehicle with safety. </li>
    <li>The population sample were recruited by advertisements on
        two Sydney &quot;Rock music&quot; FM radio stations. All
        volunteers were non-naive as regards marijuana use and
        were indeed heavy to very heavy users of this drug. The
        extent of alcohol use by the volunteers was considered to
        be within the normal range of use of this drug within the
        community. </li>
    <li>The attitudes expressed concerning the dangers associated
        with the use of the two drugs indicated that the
        population sample was heavily biased against alcohol and
        in favor of marijuana </li>
    <li>The subjective assessment of the doses of each drug
        employed indicated that they were comparable. The
        subjects assessed the degree of intoxication by marijuana
        as being of a similar intensity as that produced by
        alcohol. The doses selected therefore appear to be
        relevant to those used within the social experience of
        the volunteer population </li>
    <li>Both drugs produced significant dose-dependent effects on
        the performance measures, on the intoxication rating
        scales and on some of the mood measures. </li>
    <li>However, there were both quantitative and qualitative
        differences between these effects, both on the
        performance measures and on the subjective mood effects
        of the two drugs. </li>
    <li>By far the major effects on these tests were those
        produced by alcohol. </li>
    <li>The effect on skills performance of alcohol and marijuana
        when taken in combination was essentially one of
        addition. Marijuana tended to increase the intensity of
        the performance impairment produced by alcohol. However
        there was evidence to suggest that the lowest dose of
        marijuana produced a degree of antagonism of the effects
        of alcohol. </li>
    <li>Marijuana had no effect on the absorption or metabolism
        of alcohol. The blood alcohol concentration was not
        affected by any of the doses of marijuana used. </li>
    <li>The results of this study indicate clearly that alcohol
        and marijuana are distinctly different drugs. The effects
        produced on the performance measures were qualitatively
        and quantitatively different. In addition, the
        differences in the nature of the drug-induced subjective
        intoxication and the self-reported changes in mood
        effects such as anxiety and alertness, strongly suggested
        different drug actions. </li>
    <li>The ability to discriminate and assess the degree of
        intoxication with alcohol was not affected by marijuana.
        However, the ability to assess the intoxication due to
        marijuana was greatly affected by alcohol. The subjective
        intoxication produced by marijuana appears to be of a
        more subtle nature than that produced by alcohol. </li>
    <li>Evidence is presented which suggests that under the
        influence of alcohol, subjects engage in a
        &quot;speed-accuracy trade-off&quot;. They are prepared
        to make a hasty response to a question rather than to
        spend more time to ensure a correct answer. This effect
        could be related to a risk-taking behaviour. The results
        with marijuana on the other hand suggested a slower and
        more careful approach to the problem, though as with
        alcohol, an increased error rate in responses was
        recorded. </li>
    <li>Evidence is presented which suggests that marijuana
        produces periodic attentional lapses. </li>
    <li>The results strongly suggest that the performance
        deficits and mood changes produced by alcohol are of a
        greater magnitude than those produced by marijuana. </li>
    <li>Recommendations for directions of further research are
        made. </li>
