<LI>Nuclear power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily but not dramatically, with 36 reactors under construction in 12 countries.
<LI>Most planned reactors are in the Asian region.
<LI>Further capacity is being created by plant upgrading.
<li>Plant life extension programs are receiving serious attention.

<HR>

Although some countries, notably Japan and the Republic of Korea,
intend to continue major nuclear power construction programs,
the rate of growth of installed nuclear generating capacity over
the next ten to fifteen years is expected to be low. One country,
Italy, has completely abandoned its nuclear power program and
others have cancelled or indefinitely suspended partially constructed
and planned power reactors and/or imposed a moratorium on any
new nuclear construction.
<P>
<B>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</B>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy (IAEA) Agency estimates that by
the year 2000 worldwide installed nuclear capacity will have increased
by 9.5 to 12%, leading to a total installed capacity of some 370-380
GWe.  These IAEA estimates, and other recent industry estimates
of nuclear power growth over the near term, are based only on
firm orders and known plans for plant expansion, life extension
or closure.  They do not involve any extrapolation of theoretical
models, so are generally conservative and not subject to the large
uncertainties that resulted in speculative projections by the
nuclear industry in past decades.
<P>
Some 36 power reactors are currently being constructed in 12 countries
in the world (Table, p4), notably France, the Republic of Korea,
Japan and eastern Europe.  Two of these, Monju and Kakrapar 2,
have achieved initial criticality.  Construction is well-advanced
on many of them and, based on reported progress and allowing for
delays in countries such as India, 31 with a total net capacity
of 25,000 MWe are expected to be in operation before the year
2000.  This excludes the third and fourth Mochovce reactors in
Slovakia and three of the five reactors at Romania's first nuclear
power station.  
<P>
In addition, if the necessary financing is available, three almost-completed
950 MWe PWRs in the Ukraine could be commissioned within a few
years, replacing some of the existing nuclear capacity there and
Armenia has begun to return to service its two closed 400 MWe
reactors, with one unit planned to be restarted in 1995.
<P>
<B>INCREASED CAPACITY</B>
<P>
Increased nuclear capacity in some countries is resulting from
the uprating of existing plants.  Power reactors in Belgium, Sweden
and Germany, for example, have had their generating capacity increased.
 In Switzerland, where there is a ten-year moratorium on nuclear
power construction, a program is being undertaken to increase
the capacity of its five reactors by 10%.
<P>
Finland plans to boost the capacity of the Olkiluoto plant, which
has two 710 MWe Swedish BWRs commissioned in 1978 and 1980,  by
250 MWe (17.6%) to 1670 MWe.  The engineering program will cost
A$ 260 million.  
<P>
<B>LONGER TERM PLANS</B>
<P>
After the year 2000 and until orders are placed or construction
commenced, forecasts of installed nuclear capacity become much
less certain.  When the present construction programs are completed,
most significant nuclear power growth is expected to continue
only in the Asian region.  The International Energy Agency (IEA)
forecasts that the growth rate of electricity output from nuclear
power will be 1.3% per year for the period 1991 to 2010.  The
IEA predicts that the nuclear share of world electricity output
will decrease from 17.5% in 1991 to 13.2% in 2010.
<P>
 
<P>
ANSTO's nuclear power reactor data files show that seven countries
with existing nuclear power programs (the UK, Russia, China, India,
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) and four countries without any
nuclear capacity at present (Indonesia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran)
have announced firm plans to build new power reactors.  This does
not include North Korea, where the declared intention to introduce
LWR technology is presently under international negotiation. 
In all, 73 power reactors with a total net capacity of 60,700
MWe are planned, none in North or South America.  In addition,
orders have been placed in 1995 for two reactors in South Korea
and one in Iran.
<P>
In western Europe, Nuclear Electric, the UK nuclear utility, has
announced plans for Sizewell C (2 x 1,288 MWe, PWRs) and Hinkley
Point C (1,110 MWe, PWR).  However, the intention of the UK Governemnt
to privatise Nuclear Electric makes implementation of these plans
dependent on private sector financing.  In France, where further
reactor orders had been expected in the later half of the decade,
the national utility announced in June that it will order no new
generating capacity, nuclear or conventional, until at least the
year 2000.  Sites have, however, been designated for new power
reactors and new reactor construction is expected to be resumed
some time next decade.
<P>
In eastern Europe, the Russian government in December 1992 approved
a nuclear power construction program up to the year 2010.  In
addition to the two reactors presently being completed, a further
12, with a total capacity of 9,200 MWe, are planned to be operating
by 2010. Most are at existing sites.  Several of the oldest Russian
reactors are expected to be retired next decade and it is Russia's
announced intention to replace retired nuclear capacity by new
construction at the same site, to optimise the use of established
infrastructure and personnel.  Obtaining the approval of local
and regional authorities, which have been responsible for the
suspension of a number of nuclear power plant projects in recent
years, may be difficult.
<P>
Most planned reactors are in the Asian region.  Nuclear power
is intended to play a major role in the future electricity supply
mix in both South Korea and Japan. 
<P>
In addition to the seven reactors under construction,  South Korea
plans to bring a further seven, with a total capacity of 6,700
MWe, into operation by the year 2006.  Two 950&#160;MWe reactors
were ordered early in 1995; these are expected to be the 17th
and 18th to go on line, in 2001-2.  Japan has plans and, in most
cases, designated sites and announced timetables for a further
19 power reactors, totalling 22,000 MWe, but only two of these
have completed the governmental approval process.  Fulfilling
the necessary conditions for approval can take over a decade.

<P>
India has announced plans for twelve power reactors (4,400 MWe)
but financing difficulties are expected to continue to cause considerable
delays.  
<P>
China has begun the next phase of its nuclear power program. 
Civil construction work has started at its third nuclear power
station (2 x 600 MWe, PWRs), and an agreement with Russia for
two 953 MWe PWRs has been signed.  In 1995 China signed an agreement
with France to construct and a second nuclear power station <BR>
(2 x 900 MWe, PWRs) in Guangdong Province.  Power reactors in
other Chinese provinces are under active consideration. 
<P>
Indonesia has recently announced that the feasibility study for
its first power reactor has been completed and that construction
of the 600 MWe unit could begin as early as 1996. 
<P>
Egypt and Turkey have for decades included a nuclear power plant
in their electricity plans.  A site has been selected in each
country and a number of feasibility and other studies carried
out.  Construction remains unlikely.  
<P>
Nuclear power plant construction in Iran was suspended in 1979
but in 1995 Iran signed an agreement with Russia to complete a
1000 MWe PWR at Bushehr.  Iran also has an earlier agreement with
Russia for the supply of two 410 MWe power reactors and one with
China for the supply of a nuclear power station with two 300&#160;MWe
PWRs.  
<P>
<B>PLANT LIFE EXTENSION</B>
<P>
Most nuclear power plants have a nominal design lifetime of 20
to 40 years, but it is now believed they can operate longer and
major programs exploring plant life extension are being undertaken.
 When the oldest commercial nuclear power stations in the world,
Calder Hall and Chapelcross in the UK, were built in the 1950s,
it was assumed that they would have a useful lifetime of 20 years.
 They are now authorised to operate for 40 years and the operator
is seeking to extend their lives even further.  
<P>
The technical and economic feasibility of replacing major reactor
components, such as steam generators in PWRs and pressure tubes
in Candu HWRs, has been demonstrated.  The possibilities of component
replacement and licence renewals extending the lifetimes of existing
plants are very attractive to utilities, especially in view of
the public acceptance difficulties involved in constructing replacement
nuclear capacity.  
<P>
On the other hand, economic, regulatory and political considerations
have led to the premature closure of some power reactors, particularly
in the United States.  The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency has predicted
that 19.3 GWe of nuclear capacity (35 units) will be taken out
of service in OECD/NEA member countries between 1994 and 2010.
