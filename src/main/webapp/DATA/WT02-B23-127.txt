<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Fuel Cells for Utility and Electric Vehicle Applications: Are They Technically Viable? Will They Be Commercially Viable?</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> During recent decades there has been a sustained effort, worldwide, to develop fuel cells, operating on natural gas or coal gas, for decentralized power generation and cogeneration.  This effort, based largely on U.S. technology but vigorously pursued by Japan and many European countries as well, is driven by economic as well as environmental factors.  Almost 100 phosphoric acid fuel cell plants, which work at 390 F, are in operation all over the world, and three pivotal demonstrations of 100-KW to 2-MW units of advanced types of high-temperature fuel cells are scheduled, two of which are taking place in California this year.  These advanced high-temperature fuel cells are the molten carbonate fuel cell, operating at 1200 F, and the solid-oxide fuel cell, at 1800 F, both capable of 55-60% chemical-to-electrical efficiency.  Building on the technical successes in theis emerging technology, car manufacturers are now showing strong interest in low-temperature fuel cells such as the polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell, which operates on hydrogen or on reformed methanol at temperatures from 180 F up. </p>
<p> In the development of fuel cells beyond the lab stage, electrochemistry, chemical engineering and materials engineering play a major role.  New materials are needed for electrolyte and electodes.  The design and operation of effective electodes requires analysis of the interaction between chemical kinetics, mass transfer, heat transfer, and properties <em> in situ </em> (for example by AC impedance measurements) is a challenge. </p>
<p> Beyond the technical challenge, today's first need is to define and expand the market for fuel cells, and to find the capital to finance "traveling down the learning curve".  Some key aspects in the effort to bring fuel cells to commercial reality, especially their potential role in electric vehicles, will be discussed. </p>
