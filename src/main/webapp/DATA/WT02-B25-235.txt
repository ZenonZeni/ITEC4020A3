<HR SIZE=4>


 <P>  In an historic step toward ending discrimination, President Clinton signed into law the VA/HUD Appropriations bill which includes landmark provisions by Domenici and Wellstone requiring insurance plans to provide severe mental illness benefits at the same level of yearly and lifetime coverage as for other medical services.</P>
<P>   President Clinton wrote:  "people with mental illness have faced discrimination in health insurance coverage for too long...it is time we take steps to end this inequity."</P>
  <P>  The Senate voted 82 to 15 for the amendment and the House voted 392 to 17 to instruct VA/HUD conferees to include the amendment.   The bill passed both houses and arrived on the President’s desk for signature.</P>
  <P>  In August, AMI of Maryland members from Metropolitan Baltimore, Montgomery, Prince Georges and Anne Arundel Counties traveled to Washington D.C. by chartered bus and carpool to hold signs and march with 300 AMI members from 4 other states at a rally in front of the White House.</P>

<P>    The rally drew attention to the fact that parity was left out of The Health Care Reform bill signed by President Clinton.  Senators Domenici and Wellstone did not give up the battle. Successful passage occurred in September.</P>
  <P> The law takes effect January 1, 1998 and expires September 30, 2001.   Highlights include that employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the law and businesses are also exempt if the premium rises one percent or more. </P>
<P>How does the law affect state parity laws and other mental health mandates? State parity laws can override the national parity amendment according to an analysis of the amendment by NAMI Policy and Research Team.</P>
<P>  AMI of Maryland leaders, Adil Shamoo, Marcia Pines and others fought and succeeded in getting Maryland’s Insurance Parity Law passed in 1994 as the country’s first parity bill with comprehensive coverage.  Maryland’s leadership along with several other states was important to this first national success in the passage of parity.</P>

<H4>Background</H4>

<P>NAMI has been working long and hard (along with MHA, APA, pharmaceutical industry lobby, providers, and other) to get a parity bill passed.  Historically, the closer the bills come to being passed, the more watered down they get, before they are killed altogether.  This time, a bill actually passed thanks to NAMI’s continuing efforts.  But the bill did get significantly watered down. </P> 

<H4>What the bill does not do</H4>
<UL>

<LI>The bill does not require employers to provide insurance for NBD (neurobiological disorders, or mental illness).  It merely imposes some "mandates" on those that do by making them end annual and lifetime caps.
<LI>    The bill does not end the practice of requiring higher co-payments for mental health benefits. (ex. My own insurance policy requires a 50% co-pay for mental health services, and a $10 co-pay for all other, non-mental health services.)  That can continue.
<LI>    The bill does not end the practice of having higher deductibles for mental health services.
<LI>    The bill does not become effective until 1/1/98, which gives the business lobby plenty of time to reverse it.
<LI>     The bill does not affect people who work for companies with under 50 employees.
<LI>    And most importantly, the bill starts 1/1/98 and end 9/1/2001, so the limited impact it my have will last a very short time unless extended.
</UL>

 <P>   This bill is only a first step.  NAMI will work hard to make sure it is strengthened, not weakened, and ultimately we get a real parity bill.</P>
