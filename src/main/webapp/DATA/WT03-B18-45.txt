<p>The architecture proposed is a testbed AUV based on the
breakdown of the overall vehicle control problem into a set of
different layers which are ordered according to the time
constraints of functions at each level. In classic control theories,
the time domain can be defined as the interval required by a
function to perform its action to completion. This is important
to take time domain into consideration when adding new functions
and, above all, new decision-making capabilities to a vehicle
which is already able to control its movement. As decision-making
capabilities are not of the rapid kind, the problem may be
resolved by layering all behaviours so that the upper layer
comprises longer time-consuming functions than the lower layer:
this is the concept of Hierarchical Time Domain. Hierarchical
layering based on time domains lets the system designer place any
function in a layer according to the time the function itself takes
to produce its results. </p>

<p>A layered, hierarchical architecture has been developed on the
basis of these considerations; moreover, as data acquisition and
management is strictly coupled with control, each level has been
designed with a data manipulation side and an action control
side, both managed by an appropriate module. Four different
levels have been designed. Real time level: the fastest level;
this executes sensor management, data processing, computation of
error signals and computation of effector settings; it is
composed of a Sensor Manager for data acquisition, and an
Effector Manager for motion control. System level: controls and
maintains the vehicle system, as well as determining how
accurately the desired path has been followed; Data Assessment
module receives data collected by the lower Sensor Manager and keeps
track of them, and is able to compute trends in data evolution;
the Guidance module stores a preprogrammed mission specification
and converts it into a series of motion commands, which are
transmitted to the Effector Manager for execution. Environment
level: this deals with the vehicle&#146;s physical environment;
the Situation Assessment module handles the process of building
an understanding of the current state of the world; it records
the state of the vehicle and the features of the surrounding
world, and communicates this information to the Navigator. The
latter&#146;s task is to manage route planning: on the basis of
information from mission description (waypoints, tasks to be
performed, goals), of its own world model, and of data concerning
present vehicle situation coming from Situation Assessment; the Navigator
can generate recursively a series of actions to be performed to
accomplish a sequence of subgoals. Mission level: the top level;
this handles aspects which are particular to the mission and the
tasks to be accomplished; it is a very high-level mission
planner, which uses descriptive data from the Environment level
to retrieve overall system state, and then applies these data to
current mission requirements to obtain a sequence of mission
goals the Navigator the can use and arrange. </p>
