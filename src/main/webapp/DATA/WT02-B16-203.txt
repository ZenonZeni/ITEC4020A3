<h2>Balance of System</h2>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>e may think of a complete PV system as comprising three subsystems.  On one side, we have
the PV devices (cells, modules, arrays, etc.) that convert sunlight into direct-current (dc)
electricity.  On the other side, we have the load, or the application for which the PV electricity is
intended. Between these, we need a third subsystem to enable the PV electricity to be properly
applied to the load.  This third subsystem is generally referred to as the "balance of system" or
BOS.

<p><img border=0 align=right hspace=15 vspace=3 src="images/bos.gif">
<p><font color="#F79D00">This simple illustration shows the
elements required to get the power created by the PV system to the end load (in this example a
house).  The stand-alone system (a) uses battery storage to provide dependable dc electricity day
and night.  Even for a home connected to the utility grid (b), PV can produce electricity during
the day (converted to ac through the power conditioner).  This configuration is desirable because
extra electricity can be <a href="pvutility.html">sold to the utility</a> during the day, and the utility can in turn provide
electricity at night or during poor weather.  See this in action.</font>

<br clear=all>
<p>The BOS typically consists of structures for <a href="balance2.html">mounting the PV arrays or modules</a>
and the <a href="balance4.html">power-conditioning equipment</a> that adjusts and converts the dc electricity to the proper form
and magnitude required by an alternating-current (ac) load.  If required, the BOS also includes
<a href="balance3.html">storage devices</a>, such as batteries, for storing PV-generated electricity to be used during cloudy
days or at night.
