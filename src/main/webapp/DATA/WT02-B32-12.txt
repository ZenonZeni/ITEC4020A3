<h2>Department of Food Science and Technology</h2>
<h2>Industrial Training for Undergraduate Students</h2>
</ul>
<hr>
The Department has strong links with the food and biotechnology industries which provide training placements, sponsorship and interesting and rewarding careers for our graduates.
<p>
This document is intended to give some background information about the industrial training
element of our three sandwich course degrees (<a href="/bsc/bsc-bt.htm">BSc Biotechnology</a>,
<a href="/bsc/bsc-ft.htm">BSc Food Technology</a> and <a href="/bsc/bsc-fmmm.htm">BSc Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing</a>). Although this information is primarily aimed at potential providers of
industrial training placements, it should also be of interest to anyone else seeking general
information about these courses.
<p>
<HR>
<h3>WHY SANDWICH COURSES?</h3>
<p>
<h4>How will organisations offering placements benefit?</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Students can provide a fresh approach to the company and often throw new light on familiar problems.
<li>Students can carry out short, but important, investigations or projects which the company has no other means of resourcing.
<li>Companies can assess students as potential employees.
<li>Industry is able to make a positive impact on the education of its future employees.
<li>Placements can lead to contact with academic staff of the University to the mutual benefit of both parties.
</ul><p>
<h4>How do students benefit from Industrial Training?</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The opportunity to apply principles taught at University to real industrial situations and problems.	
<li>The opportunity to broaden their experience and knowledge and to develop practical skills in a working environment.
<li>The opportunity to develop inter-personal and communication skills.
<li>The opportunity to appreciate the organisation of industry including the interaction between technological, social and economic factors.
<li>The opportunity to gain experience in different sectors of the industry and different functions within it.
<li>The opportunity to make informed career choices on graduation.
</ul>
<p>
<HR>
<h3>WHAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE ARE THE STUDENTS LOOKING FOR?</h3>
<p>
A large variety of functional areas are suitable for industrial training.  It is the nature
of the experience that is important, and not necessarily the nature, or even size, of the
employing organisation.  The industrial training should contribute to the development of the
student by providing responsibility commensurate with their level of experience, potential
and degree of maturity.  A well designed programme will develop the students personal skills
as well as their technical competence.
<p>
The Department currently runs three sandwich course degrees and students on each of these
courses will possibly require different kinds of experience.  The Department will be very
happy to discuss the objectives of the placement for each group and also to provide examples
of typical training programmes. 
<p>
<HR>
<h3>WHAT SUPPORT WILL THE UNIVERSITY GIVE?</h3>
<p>
The Department ensures the smooth running of student placements in several ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Students are given careful pre-placement guidance to create a high level of awareness of what is expected of them in industry.
<li>The Department will nominate students to companies for their consideration.
<li>Members of the Industrial Training Office will help companies design suitable training programmes for the student.
<li>Students will be visited during their placement by their academic tutor.
<li>The tutor can be seen as a resource to help design and evaluate any project work in which the student is involved.
<li>Counselling ands support is available for the student throughout the period through the academic tutor or the Industrial Training team.
<li>Students are advised that as employees of the host company, they will be subject to the regulations and practices of their workplace.
<li>Students are reminded they are ambassadors of the University.  The placements are an integral part of the course and they will be expected to bring high levels of commitment and performance to their host company.
<li>If students are involved in matters which the host company considers sensitive, confidentiality will be observed and discretion maintained.
<li>The Department provides three members of staff to support the placement scheme  who are available to answer any queries.
</ul>
<p>
<HR>
<h3>WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THE EMPLOYER?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare an agreed training programme for the student which should be made available to the University before the start of the placement.
<li>Appoint an industrial mentor to supervise and monitor the progress of the student and the training programme.
<li>Pay the student an agreed wage which should be sufficient for the student to meet all their expenses during industrial training.
<li>Where possible assist the student in finding suitable accommodation .
<li>The industrial mentor, and any other relevant people, should be available to report on the students progress to the student’s academic tutor when the tutor visits the student on placement.  The tutor should also have the opportunity of speaking to the student on their own and also have the opportunity to see the areas where the student has been working.
<li>Provide a written report on the students progress at the end of the training period.
</ul>
<p>
<HR>
<h3>WHEN ARE STUDENTS AVAILABLE?</h3>
<p>
Students on the sandwich courses carry out a minimum of three and potentially four industrial training 
placements.  The diagram below shows when students are available for placement.<p>

<p>
If you are an employer and decide to offer training we will advertise your opportunity to the relevant group of students and arrange to send you CVs (or completed application forms if you prefer).  You may then select those students you wish to interview. Interviews can be held either at your company or in the Department if this is more convenient.
<p>
Some companies give short presentations to the sandwich course students describing their company and the placements and graduate opportunities that are available and invite applications from interested students.  These presentations usually take place early in the Autumn Term and we would be happy to arrange one for you if you think this would be of benefit.<p>
