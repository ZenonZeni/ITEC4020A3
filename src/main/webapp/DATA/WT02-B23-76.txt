ARCO Arena was dedicated in November 1988 as the new home of the Sacramento
Kings of the National Basketball Association for a cost of $40 million dollars.
The facility was built and is operated without any taxpayer dollars.

<p>

Since its opening in 1988, the Kings have sold out every game, and now hold
the NBA's longest consecutive sell-out streak.

<p>

Conveniently located near the intersections of Interstate 5 and Interstate 80,
ARCO Arena is only five minutes from downtown Sacramento and 90 miles from
either the San Francisco Bay Area or Reno/Lake Tahoe.

ARCO Arena was designed with a unique configuration for unparalleled sight
lines to watch basketball. The 442,000 square foot facility features such
amenities as 30 luxury suites, a state-of-the-art Panasonic AstroVision video
display system that stands three stories high and an audio system that boasts
over 300 speakers.

<p>

An average of 1.7 million spectators annually attend events at ARCO which hosts
nearly 200 events per year varying from concerts, NHL Hockey, Arena Football,
Indoor Soccer, professional tennis and the Ringley Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus.

basketball season. ARCO is built on 105 acres featuring up to 12,000 parking
spaces in a fully lighted parking lot. Among the indoor amenities are 14
concession stands with 100 cash registers, two lounges overlooking the arena
interior; eight locker rooms; 297 public toilets; and 24 hour security.
