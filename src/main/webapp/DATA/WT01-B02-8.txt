<P>	<B>Parental Rights Drama Unfolds</B><BR>

<P>	Primarily drafted by Michael Farris and Home School Legal Defense Association attorneys, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA) was introduced on June 28, 1995, in the House and the Senate as H.R. 1946 and S. 984. The PRRA affirms the right of parents to control the upbringing and training of their children—rights that have been eroded by conflicting state court decisions.<BR>
	Home School Legal Defense Association believes that passage of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act will significantly increase the protection of home schooling freedoms. Too often state courts refuse to hold parental rights as fundamental. The 1993 Michigan Supreme Court's rulings in DeJonge and Bennett clearly illustrate the need for the PRRA. In DeJonge, the Court ruled that teacher certification, as applied to religiously motivated home schooling parents, was unconstitutional. But in the companion Bennett case decided the same day, the Court found that secular home schooling parents suffered no constituional violation when forced to comply with the certification requirement. The Michigan Supreme Court held that religious freedom was a fundamental right, whereas &quot;parents' rights&quot; were &quot;nonfundamental&quot; in nature.<BR>
	HSLDA staff have been working hard to promote this important legislation and secure co-sponsors in the House and Senate. The following is a summary of the key events which have taken place during the past several months.<BR>
 <BR>
October 24 — Doug Phillips, Director of Federal Issues for the National Center for Home Education, led a group of Congressional Action Program (CAP) volunteers, several National Center staff members, and HSLDA's four interns to Capitol Hill to lobby for the PRRA. <BR>
	As a result, more than 20 congressmen added their names to the list of PRRA co-sponsors. <BR>

<P>October 26, Rayburn House Office Building — After months of work by legislators, home schoolers, and concerned parents, the House Sub-Committee on the Constitution heard testimony on the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act in a hearing room packed with legislative aides, media representatives, and supporters and opponents of the bill. Members of the Committee present for this first round of hearings included Congressmen Charles Canady (Chairman R-FL), Robert Goodlatte (R-VA), Bob Inglis (R-SC), Barney Frank (D-MA), Patricia Schroeder (D-CO), John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), and Melvin Watt (D-NC).<BR>
	The first panel of experts to testify included the primary congressional sponsors of the PRRA—Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Mike Parker (R-MS), and Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA). Congressman Largent asserted, &quot;The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act is needed because the government is using its coercive force to dictate values, offend the religious and moral beliefs of families, and restrict the freedoms of families to live as they choose.&quot;<BR>
	A skeptical Congressman Watt challenged him, &quot;You think you can clear the fog with eight pages of legislation?&quot;<BR>
	&quot;This is not a complicated issue,&quot; Largent responded, &quot;It is just a shield for parents. This is only a legal recourse for parents to protect their rights as parents.&quot;<BR>
	Senator Grassley contended that Congress has a constitutional responsibility to pass this legislation: <BR>
It is appropriate for Congress to act within its 14th Amendment, Section 5 power to see that liberty rights are properly protected . . . The PRRA accomplishes this goal by clarifying that the proper standard to use in disputes between the government and parents is the highest legal standard available. This standard, known as the 'compelling interest standard' means that before the government can interfere in the parent-child relationship, it must demonstrate that there is a 'compelling' interest to protect—not a good or even very good interest. It must be compelling.<BR>
But Congressman Schroeder expressed concern that the PRRA may make it easer for parents to abuse their children with impunity. Representative Parker quickly responded:<BR>
My wife and I have housed over a dozen foster children in our home during our 25 years of marriage. All those children came from homes of parents who did not care for them, with many of them having their parental rights terminated. This legislation will not prohibit the social service agencies from continuing the difficult job they perform daily. Children that are being abused or neglected will hopefully be removed from their uncaring homes immediately. From a personal standpoint, I say to the critics of this bill that my family has invested too much in the protection of children to support legislation that might further harm them. This legislation offers a balance between the rights of parents and the protection of our precious children.<BR>
After the sponsors spoke, committee members heard from a second panel consisting of Vicki Rafel, National PTA Board of Directors; Greg Erken, Executive Director, Of the People; Martin Guggenheim, Professor, New York University School of Law; Colleen Pinyan, Coordinator, Office of Public Affairs, The Rutherford Institute; Marilyn Van Derbur, former Miss America; and Michael P. Farris, President, Home School Legal Defense Association.<BR>
	Not surprisingly, Rafel testified in opposition to the PRRA, stating that the PTA believes<BR>
many entities at the local, state, and federal levels have responsibilities in providing for and protecting children. These individuals and institutions are not just a part of a local community. They are also part of a total system of services and accountability that must be intertwined to provide an optimum environment for all children. Decisions affecting children should be made in a collaborative effort involving all the stakeholders, including parents, educators, health-care givers and governing bodies.<BR>
Farris sharply disagreed:<BR>
Government lawyers, government agencies, courts, and the United States military all need to know that this nation believes parents' rights are fundamental. They need to know that parents whose rights are threatened by government intrusions will receive the highest level of legal protection. They need to know that the government cannot run over those parents and decide for itself how children should be raised.<BR>
Van Derbur gave an emotional account of her abusive home, urging Congress to defeat the Act. She pleaded with committee members that someone must &quot;speak for the children . . . [the PRRA would] . . . smother their voices.&quot; Congressman Schroeder thanked Van Derbur for &quot;putting a human face on this issue.&quot;<BR>
	The third and final panel of the hearing consisted of academics George W. Dent, Professor, Case Western Reserve University School of Law; Barbara Bennett Woodhouse, Professor, University of Pennsylvania School of Law; and Wade F. Horn, Ph.D., Director, National Fatherhood Initiative.<BR>
	Committee members asked: What are reasonable corporal punishments? What about medical decisions such as blood transfusions? Should parents really be making these decisions for their children? Wouldn't this intrude on the rights of children?<BR>
	Another hot issue was federalism. Opponents of the PRRA argue that this legislation is an infringement of state's rights. Congressman Barney Frank chided conservatives, &quot;This is the most blatant augmentation of the federal government I've ever seen.&quot; <BR>
	Michael Farris responded to these concerns:<BR>
	I would like to say a final word about federalism. I am a staunch believer in the Tenth Amendment. I believe that Congress should only do those things that are explicitly authorized in the Constitution. I am not a fan of implied congressional power. But I believe that Congress has a solemn obligation to do its utmost to discharge all of its explicit constitutional duties. One of those duties, pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, is to protect the rights of American citizens when state governments diminish or violate those rights. The right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children has been grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment for nearly seventy-five years. <BR>
	I believe that the Supreme Court was absolutely correct in saying that it was a violation of Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution for the State of Oregon to ban private education in the 1920's. I would submit that if the Supreme Court correctly discharged its duties as a branch of the federal government to protect the rights of American parents when a state went too far, this Congress has a co-equal duty to protect the constitutional liberties of American parents. State courts, state agencies, lower courts, bureaucrats, and lawyers are diminishing the rights of American parents. This bill does not create any federal programs. It does not spend a dime of taxpayer money. It does not create a single administrative position. It simply sets a legal standard. Adoption of this bill will indicate that this Congress believes that parents rights are fundamental, nothing more, nothing less.<BR>

<P>November 1 — Michael Farris appeared with Congressman Largent on CNN's Burden of Proof, a program analyzing the legal aspects of current national issues and legislation. Representing the opposition was former Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders. Mike and Congressman Largent did an outstanding job refuting arguments brought against the PRRA.<BR>

<P>December 1 — James Dobson interviewed Congressman Steve Largent and Senator Charles Grassley about the PRRA on the December 1 Focus on the Family radio program. Listeners were encouraged to contact their congressman and senators and urge their co-sponsorship of the PRRA.<BR>

<P>December 4 — CAP volunteers visited 80 senate offices, encouraging the senators to co-sponsor the PRRA and to attend the subcommittee hearing.<BR>

<P>December 5, Dirksen Senate Office Building — The Senate held sub-committee hearings on the PRRA. The senate subcommittee members are Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA)—the PRRA's key sponsor, Mike DeWine (R-OH), Hank Brown (R-CO), Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Howell Heflin (D-AL), Russell Feingold (D-WI), and Herbert Kohl (D-WI). Michael Farris, along with several other witnesses from the House hearings testified. <BR>
	Rep. Steve Largent opened as first witness on behalf of the PRRA.<BR>
	&quot;When the government becomes an obstacle or chips away at the freedoms parents rely on to raise their children, our country risks losing that fundamentally important quality that has made our country great—freedom.  I introduced the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act to protect and support the backbone of our country—free citizens and free parents.&quot;  <BR>
	Rep. Largent urged subcommittee members to take a realistic look at the increasing obstacles parents face today.  <BR>
	&quot;The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act is needed because the government is using its coercive force to dictate values, offend the religious and moral beliefs of families, and restrict the freedoms of families to live as they choose.&quot;<BR>
	Sen. Howell Heflin questioned the PRRA's purpose and expressed concern that it would intrude upon states' rights. &quot;If the Supreme Court has already upheld these rights, I see no need for this Act,&quot; he stated.  <BR>
	Rep. Largent responded, <BR>
&quot; [the PRRA is] consistent with the proper concept of Federalism.  While states have the general jurisdiction and authority over education, child welfare, and health care issues, the federal government has authority to protect the rights of its citizens and ensure that states employ their power in a way that respects the rights of American parents.&quot;<BR>
	Opening the second panel of witnesses, Michael Farris reminded subcommittee members that it would be impractical to ask every family to take its case to the Supreme Court. &quot;Parents' rights should be protected at the first court they go to; they should not have to go to great lengths and expense to receive a just ruling.&quot;  Farris further explained the problem with relying on lower courts without the aid of the legal standard which would be established by the PRRA:  &quot;The Supreme Court has failed to use explicit enough language and has failed to take enough parental liberty cases in the past twenty years.  Lower state and federal courts, and the countless government agencies just don't seem to understand that parental rights should be accorded this high level of protection.&quot;<BR>
	Sammy Quintana, president-elect of the National School Boards Association, claimed the PRRA is &quot;about making it more difficult for public schools to teach our children.  It is about lining the pockets of lawyers and draining the scarce educational resources in our schools.  It is about playing politics with our children.&quot;  Another anti-PRRA witness, Margaret Brinig of the University of Louisville, insisted the Act would hurt children's rights in favor of parental whims.  She claimed that the PRRA would harm the state's ability to protect children.<BR>
	Director of the National Fatherhood Initiative and child psychologist Wade Horn countered, &quot;Some see the declining well-being of children as the rationale for further state intervention in family life.  But there is very little evidence that further abdication of authority over children to the state will enhance the well-being of children.  Rather, I believe that the declining well-being of children in America is the direct result of the increasing authority the state has obtained over the rearing of children.&quot;<BR>
	Georgia lawyer Chip Angell aptly summed up the issue (and brought down the house several times) with his direct, rhetoric-demolishing testimony.  &quot;We must not deny the simple plain fact that parents can parent better than any agency or school.  Parents are tired of government intrusion.  They don't need busybodies in Washington telling them what to do.  I have seven children of my own, and I pray you'll pass this bill.&quot;<BR>

<P>Action—Home schoolers need to continue to deliver a steady stream of calls to their congressmen and senators to build support for the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act. This extremely important piece of legislation will likely pass in 1996—if we keep up the momentum.<BR>
Please read the list of PRRA co-sponsors on page 23.  If your senators and representative are not co-sponsors of this legislation, please call today and ask them to take a stand for parents' rights by supporting the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.  If your congressman or senator is a co-sponsor of the PRRA, we encourage you to send a letter of appreciation.<BR>

<P><B>A Home Grown Case for Freedom</B><BR>
by Michael Farris<BR>

<P>	Oliver North, John Poindexter, and Ronald Reagan were pillaged in the editorial pages of this nation for their allegedly unlawful activities. What were they accused of? In simple terms, they were accused of supplying military aid to the Contras in Nicaragua in violation of a congressional prohibition on such aid. They were accused of conducting foreign policy in a manner which allegedly violated an act of Congress.<BR>
	Even though the media regularly screamed about the &quot;illegality&quot; of Iran-Contra, there seemed to be extra vehemence in the press attacks because the whole affair was originally executed in secret. The press hates all secrets which do not involve them.<BR>
	Bill Clinton has shown that it is completely acceptable to conduct illegal foreign military operations so long as everything is done in the open.<BR>
	Home schooler, Specialist Michael New refused to obey an order which required him to undertake service for the United Nations on a mission into Macedonia. <BR>
	Spc. New was ordered to wear a U.N. uniform. Awaiting him in Macedonia would be a further requirement that he surrender his U.S. Army identification card to be replaced by a U.N. card—identifying him not as an American soldier but as U.N. personnel. New was also placed under the command of a French General and an Iraqi ambassador who serve the United Nations.<BR>
	Legal research I undertook for New's lawyers demonstrates that it is clearly illegal to require any American soldier to wear U.N. insignia on a U.S. military uniform (transforming it into what the military calls the U.N. uniform). Foreign insignia are strictly prohibited on U.S. military uniforms unless specifically authorized by Congress. And, needless to say, Congress has never dared to cross the American public by ordering U.S. soldiers to wear U.N. uniforms.<BR>
	But not only is it illegal to require U.S. soldiers to wear the U.N. uniform, it is clearly illegal for Clinton to send American troops to serve in a U.N. military action.<BR>
	Clinton and the U.N. claim to be operating under the U.N. Charter which the United States ratified in 1945. Chapter VII, Article 43 of the U.N. Charter authorizes the use of armed forces on loan from willing member-nations &quot;for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.&quot; There is an important restriction on this use of armed forces by the U.N. which is spelled out in both the U.N. charter and U.S. law.  The U.N. Charter calls for &quot;special agreement or agreements&quot; to be negotiated by the member-nations to specify the numbers, types of forces, their degree of readiness, and the nature of the military assistance to be provided.<BR>
	The United States Congress passed a law in 1949 to implement America's participation in the U.N. This act, 22 U.S.C. ¤ 287d, requires the President to negotiate such &quot;special agreements&quot; before sending any U.S. military personnel into the service of the United Nations under Article 43. Importantly, the law requires that such agreements must be ratified by Congress.<BR>
	Has this been done? Well don't take my word for it. Read the testimony of Conrad K. Harper, Legal Advisor, Department of State, given in Congress on March 4, 1994. <BR>
	With respect to U.S. law, the President has both statutory and constitutional authority to enable the United States to participate in and support U.N. peace operations. In particular under Section 6 of the United Nations Participation Act [22 U.S.C. ¤ 287d], the President is authorized to negotiate special agreements with the U.N. Security Council, thereby making units of the U.S. Armed Forces available to the Council on its call pursuant to Article 43 [Chapter VII] of the UN Charter. Such agreements are subject to the approval of Congress, but further Congressional authorization would not be required for the President to make forces available pursuant to such an agreement in a particular case. In practice, of course, no action had ever been taken under Section 6 of the Act because no agreements have ever been concluded under Article 43. <BR>
	The United Nations has passed a number of resolutions calling for the use of military forces in Macedonia. Every resolution references Chapter VII, Article 43 as the source for its authority.<BR>
	In other words, it is completely illegal for Bill Clinton or any other U.S. president to send American troops into a war zone under the command or auspices of the United Nations because Congress has never ratified any Article 43 special agreements to specify the terms and conditions of U.S. military actions with the United Nations.<BR>
	An election year is coming and it is reasonable to suppose that Bill Clinton realizes that a popular military action will result in greater popularity. Apparently, this is an old political ploy, because the founding fathers took the trouble to build a constitutional barrier to this kind of grandstanding.<BR>
	James Madison wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson on April 2, 1798, which proclaimed, &quot;The Constitution supposes, what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the legislature.&quot;<BR>
	Clinton's incursion into Macedonia, and the related even larger deployment to Bosnia, may or may not be in the best interest of the United States. The same, however, could have been said about the sale of military weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits therefrom to supply the Contras in Nicaragua.<BR>
	Back then we were repeatedly told, &quot;it is not a question of policy, it is a question of legality.&quot; <BR>
	Where are these voices today? Clinton's military exercise to Macedonia is debatable on policy grounds. But it is clearly illegal. <BR>
	If Clinton's policy is good policy, let him negotiate the special agreement and bring it to Congress for ratification. Since he has not done so, he is without lawful authority to send America's bravest men and women into harms way to die in U.N. uniforms carrying U.N. identity cards.<BR>
	Perhaps it's time for yet another special prosecutor.<BR>
	Home schoolers are appropriately wary of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. We know that U.N. control over American policy threatens our freedoms to educate and raise our children. We have fought hard for the sovereignty of our families and our nation.<BR>
	We can be proud that the young American who has the moral courage to call the President to account for his violation of the law is from our own ranks. Freedom is not store-bought. It is grown at home.
