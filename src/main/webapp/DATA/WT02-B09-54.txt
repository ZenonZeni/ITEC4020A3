<h2 ALIGN=center>Test Your Skills: Do You Lead Effective Meetings?</h2>



Conducting business meetings requires a talent of its own. In no other arena do you have to be leader, encourager, entertainer, speaker, listener, and facilitator all at the same time. Do you have what it takes to lead an effective meeting? <p>



<BR>



 Take this quiz to find out. (Answer True or False)<p>







<ul>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. Weekly staff meetings are a good idea to keep everyone on track for the week's work.


<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. Body language is less important in meetings than it is during non-meeting occasions.


<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. Conference calls and computer conferencing can never replace traditional in-person meetings.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. Always attend meetings yourself. Sending another person insults the person who called the meeting and intimidates the person you send.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. You should group your meetings together consecutively during one morning.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. Meeting times should be made in advance along with the meeting's ending times.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. You should schedule a "meeting with yourself" if you're having a difficult time finding the time to complete your own tasks.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. The more people invited to the meeting the better the outcome will be because more people will be informed at the same time.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. At any meeting you attend, you have the right to demand a competent leader even if that means taking over the meeting yourself.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. Monday morning, bright and early, is the best time for a meeting because everyone is refreshed from the weekend break.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 11. A meeting agenda isn't necessary unless the leader needs it.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 12. Meetings must begin without any social conversations beforehand.<BR>



<BR><BR>Answers: <BR>
<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. False. If meetings are held regularly, they could become stale. It's better to call meetings on an "as-needed" basis.<BR>



<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. False. Body language is immensely valuable in the meeting atmosphere. Nonverbal communications such as raised eyebrows, nods and notebooks closing signal distinct messages.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. False. Conference calls, video conferences and computer conferences are becoming valuable in replacing the cost in money and time of having in-person meetings. Yet, face-to-face meetings are still needed in some instances.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. False. Your colleagues should understand that whoever you send is totally competent of representing you. And, your employees should jump at the chance to learn and grow by attending meetings for you.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. True. When you have meetings back-to-back and crammed into one morning, you have a viable reason to end each meeting on time – to get to your next meeting.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. True. Open-ended meetings tend to stay unfocused. Ideally, each item to be discussed in the meeting should have an allotted time frame. When the time is up, the leader should summarize and move to the next topic or end the meeting.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. True. Scheduling this "meeting" into your daily plan allows you an excuse to say "No" to the requests of others for your time – you have a meeting to attend.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. False. More effort must be exerted to lead a meeting with each person added to its attendance. Keeping a multitude of people focused is often impossible. If you desire nothing more than to share information and don't want any give-and-take, a large meeting is probably okay.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. True. Unless you're part of the upper level of leaders in your organization, this may be difficult for you to accomplish but you can do your part to keep the meeting focused on its intent. When meeting with peers, go ahead and take control yourself if the meeting is going nowhere.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. False. Mondays and Fridays are the worst meeting days. On Mondays, everyone needs time to plan for the week and read the weekend's mail. On Fridays, people are winding down for the weekend. Wednesday mornings are the best times for meetings because everyone will be in their "work mode" and in high gear.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 11. False. An agenda should be the cornerstone of every meeting. Ideally, it should be completed and given to meeting attendees a few days before the meeting.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 12. False. Social talk tends to "soften" the atmosphere. Keep the conversation to a minimum and start the meeting on time.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Motivating Employees To Change Behavior</h2>



As a leader and manager, one of your primary responsibilities is to get your employees to produce desirable results through specific behaviors. To do this, many times you have to get them to actually change their behavior patterns. The key principle to understand in changing employees' behavior is that you can't change it for them; they must change it themselves. <p>



<BR>






With that principle in mind, the following is how to motivate employees to change their behavior:<p>







<ul>



<BR>


I. Identify the Desired Behavior You Want the Employee to Have <BR>





<BR>


To help you identify the desired behavior, apply these principles:<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Behavior is something the employee does. Attitudes and feelings aren't behavior.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. The outcome or result of the behavior must be positive and help you and the employee reach your goals. The behavior must also be meaningful to the employee. <BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. The behavior must be specific and easy to understand. For example, scheduling interviews, closing sales, calculating cash receipts, etc.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> D. The behavior must be easy to measure accurately.<BR>


<BR>





II. Communicate the Behavior You Want and Be Sure the Employee Understands What You Expect in Terms of: <BR>






<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. The specific behavior you want.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. The benefits of mastering the behavior.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. The consequences of not executing the behavior.<BR>





<BR>


III. Keep Score<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Score keeping must be seen as helpful and positive.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. Accurate score keeping motivates people to do better. Personal biases of management are removed. Results are rewarded.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. Score keeping can make work fun.<BR>





<BR>


IV. Evaluate the Results of Keeping Score<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. How did the employee do in mastering the behavior?


<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. What went well?<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. What went wrong? How can it be corrected?<BR>






<BR>


V. Dealing With the Consequences<BR>



<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Reinforce the desired behavior. With reinforcement, the employee will adopt the new behavior. Without it, the past behavior will return.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. In the absence of a positive and/or negative reinforcement, you will get behavior at a level just above the point of punishment or the minimum acceptable.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. When negative behavior is exhibited by an employee: 1. Give a warning and explain in depth the new behavior you expect; 2. Give frequent feedback on the spot. Don't wait! Don't store up criticisms; 3. Be sure the feedback you give is appropriate.<BR>






<BR>


VI. Encourage Positive Productive Behaviors<BR>


<BR>





Form the habit of complimenting your employees for their accomplishments to reinforce the desirable behavior. Even though an inept employee behaves as you want about 80 percent of the time, most managers tend to reinforce behavior in the opposite ratio. They typically give four reprimands or criticisms for each compliment. <BR>






<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Use intrinsic (internal) rewards as opposed to extrinsic (external) rewards.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. Give positive "strokes" for positive behavior quickly and often. Give strokes honestly and unconditionally. Don't give them and take them away by adding comments such as "that was great, but I know you can do better."<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. Don't penalize the employee you're rewarding by adding work to their jobs unless you're certain they want added responsibilities and duties.<BR>








<BR>


VII. Evaluate and Adjust<BR>


<BR>





Evaluate the results of the behavior. Did you and the employee succeed in reaching goals? Where do you go from here? In motivating you employees to change their behavior, one of the key criterions is that you and the employee both agree that the behavior needs to be changed and that both know exactly what the desirable behavior is. By having this clear understanding, you're both able to continuously monitor and observe the actual behavior. This allows you to deal with it immediately and make the proper adjustments. What most employees tend to do is "keep the water muddy" by not having this clear understanding with their managers. To effectively help employees change their behavior, clear understanding and accountability is an absolute must. <BR>





<BR>


Use these principles to get the most out of yourself and your people. <BR>
