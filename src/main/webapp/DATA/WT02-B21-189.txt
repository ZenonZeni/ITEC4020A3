<BR>What do we need to do about it and why?</I></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_ISSUE -->
<LI>I feel our most important issue today is the well being and education of our children.
<LI>good parenting-all high school juniors should be taught how to be better parents, and how to teach morality to their children.
<LI>The Newt Gingrich controversy.  I don't think a man should be in power if he has admitted to violating the laws of the Ethics committee.
<LI>Reform of the political system with regard to less influence from those with more money to contribute.

<LI>Shutdown the IRS and go to consumption tax
<LI>Regain credibility in our government at all levels.
<LI>Overpopulation.  We cannot sustain our current rate of population
growth comfortably or for long.  Education and empowerment (the ways AND means) of effective birth control is a must.
<LI>i think every issue is important to somebody. every opinion 
counts!
<LI>There should be numerous job opportunities available to college graduates (like me with my English degree). 
<LI>The most important is drug abuse.  what we should do about it, 
to eliminate all of the drug dealers, not just the big guys but all
of them.  Not jail, but they should be put to death!!  Slowly and 
Painfully!!!
<LI>Predjudice towards black people DOES NOT EXIST anymore. The only predjudice that I see is the racial intolerance for white people. White people have become the evil of the world.
<LI>The absurd proliferation of political correctness.  Any thing remotely relating to PC should be abolished.
<LI>aids, find a cure, due to loss of may innocent people 
<LI>The tax system. We need a simpler, fairer, flatter tax rate to spur economic growth.
<LI>The breakdown of American societal mores.
<LI>Red Mercury.
Developements associated with this compound seem to have run
rife ever since Dr. Sleight synthesised it in 1968. Currently
it is used to amplify the power of Pure Fusion bombs.
The public should be informed of all aspects of the substance
in order to exert control over its trade and use.
<LI>EXECUTION:Those sentenced to die should have no more than one 
appeal. Upon the conclusion of this appeal, if the sentence is 
upheld, sentence should be carried out, PUBLICLY within a two
week period.
<LI>Ethics among politicians. If 70-80% of eligible citizens voted 
and there was a third party for more choice, the best person 
could be elected, instead of somebody with a questionable past 
or lack of consideration for those they represent.
<LI>Crime. When someone is sentanced to 5 Years theyn should serve 
5 Years. Not this 8 months crap.
<LI>I think the immigration is a major problem right now.  I don't mind them immigrating here, that is the freedom of this country but I feel that we shouldn't have to learn a new language just to accomodate them.
<LI>Homelessness is at an all time high, now.  We need to 
start helping our own country for once.
<LI>The most important issue in the United States today is the peoples'
relation with their government.  We seem to be moving further away from
the philosophy, "of the people, by the people, and for the people."
<LI>Justice system needs to be evaluated.  People given a sentence rarely serve enough time.  Deals in capital murder offenses should be eliminated.
<LI>A closer investigation of the Clintons
<LI>The government...Cut out the waste so we can take care of 
are own peolpe.
<LI>The Enviornment and Zero Population Growth.  If we continue to annihilate the planet we're on, none of the rest of this stuff will matter.  Think about it - long term.
<LI>Limit political contributions to $100 per candedate per U.S. citizen, only.
<LI>cool..!!??:-):-)  :-)  :-)  :-(  :-(  :-(



<LI>Governments must be drastically downsized and the principle of self-responsibility  must be reinfused in society.
<LI>Drugs and crime. Put and end to it all by applying more strict
punishment, like the death penelty for anyone selling and distributing
drugs.
<LI>Use technology to rid hunger and disease
<LI>Eliminating the entire socialist mixed-economy welfare state and moving to a capitalist society in which all people are allowed to freely trade the products of their minds without force or fraud.
<LI>The erosion of responsible liberty.  The Founding Fathers of this nation knew that freedom could not be maintained if people were unwilling to live an upright life.  We have lost much of our liberty because people have decided that they are the only arbiters of what is "right", regardless of the consequences to others.
<LI>The vast and expanding beurocracy (that is the US government) which claims to help all, but, in reality, only breeds dependency, lack of personal responsibility, and lack of the individual's initiative to take control of one's own life.
<LI>Illegal immigrants are taking our tax dollars illegally and we are not putting a stop to it.  We are responsible first to the citizens of this country, and we are lacking.
<LI>The need to return to an emphasis on healing of the American family.
<LI>We are sneding too much money over to foreign countries to feed and clothe their hungry people.  We have hungry and homeless people here in the USA that need to be taken care of first!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I don't think there is only one issue that is more important than any other, I think what is important is to open communication more so we can deal with all the issues.
<LI>Goverment waste-high taxes
<LI>The growing totalitarianism disguised as "Democracy" and/or the belief by individuals
that their attempts at improving the situation are useless.  This is a combined problem
such that each feeds on the other.  The more people that feel they "must" vote and act
a certain way to match a perceived majority accelerates the loss of freedoms and
effectiveness by everyone.
<LI>The crumbling of morals in the most important issue.  We need to 
strengthen the family and teach parents to teach responsibility
to their children.
<LI>I think that all drugs should be legalized, and mandated by the governments.  The Dutch have been doing this for how long and have been successful in their efforts.

<LI>i think our most important problem is themove the country is always making toward socialism. it's like we defeated it in russia. now we have it here. we should get the fedral government out of  everything. let local governments take care of themselves & make there own laws
<LI>world peace, if something donsent happen soon thare will not be
a world.
<LI>JOBS
<LI>High school juniors should be taught about being good parents. this is more important than how to wear a condom.
<LI>Prop.209 was voted in by majority on Nov 6th and its 
being attacked with the potentiality to be overturned!
Those of us who voted it in
<LI>Free education (not schooling) for all regardless of age.
<LI>US GOVT. national debt and deficit spending. Limit military and entitlement spending
until the national debt is reduced to zero.  Then deficit spending should be limited to
as needed (emergancy) only. (2/3 Congress majority/President veto)
<LI>The US is becoming a society of the "haves" and the "have not" and this is creating a stress on the working class who supports both ends. I really don't know what to do about it, but if something doesn't change I believe a form of revolution is in our near future.
<LI>Our nation needs to get back to the principles it was founded
upon.
<LI>The most important current issue in America is the corruption that involves the government and  our elected representatives.
<LI>The most important issue is our youth! They are the leaders 
of tomorrow! There is a major problem with drug/alcohol 
abuse in this country & parents shrug their shoulders &
blame it on society. They are the parents! They(& the 
schools)need to start taking more responsibility & pay
more attention to how they are raising, influencing & 
teaching these kids! Why do you think so many young people
are in gangs? They don't get any attention and/or love
and/or understanding!!!
<LI>Health Care Costs.

We should immediately move to a single-payer system of health care, with
regulated prices.  The increasing numbers of elderly will crush our
society otherwise.
<LI>Literacy. Our children are being passed through school when they can barely read.  We need to take part in our children's education.  After all, they are the future. 
<LI>Peace is the answer to many of the world's problems
<LI>By far the most important is the US trade relations with China.  If nothing is done, our standard of life will drop considerably over the next 10-15 years.
<LI>I think people without common sense ought to be studied to see
how in the world they are able to survive.
<LI>Decay of family.  Encourage young people to become more morally responsible adults.
<LI>Taxes!
<LI>The AIDS epidemic. 
<LI>Crime.
<LI>Robberies:there should be security systems
<LI>Ending world hunger.
<LI>We need to create more opportunities -- educational, career, habitats -- for Americans
<LI>Sexual web pages should be free. It's up to the parents to regulate there childerns computer activity.
<LI>welfare abuse
<LI>We are reducing standards of education and at the same time removing the stigma of poor moral and intelectual performance. ALL aplicable laws should promote acheivment and penalize failure and complaciency. No strength or power can come without earlier expending strength and power.
<LI>I think that the answer to alot of the problems in this society 
is religion.  Christian religion has a way of helping people work
out their problems and be happy.

<LI>moral relativism which is dragging this country into the abyss.
if gov't officials were able to take a moral stand on what is morally right and wrong, 
wouldn't have the drug, teen-pregnancies, ebonics, etc. problems 
that are evitdent today.  All that gov't needs to do is embrace
the notion that religion is good for humanity, whether it be
Judiasm, Christianty, Islam, or otherwise.  They all teach good moral
values.  Personally, ethical monotheism is the best option!
<LI>Distribution of wealth and resources.  Share the wealth and the resources with those who do not have them.
<LI>Make ENGLISH the official language, i.e, no Spanish on voting, no Ebonics, etc.)
<LI>most important issue:  equal treatment for all, in all ways.  this must include marriage.
<LI>I believe that the most important issues will be educating our children to be economically independent knowledge workers.
<LI>AIDS research - more money for same.
<LI>The Lack of Respect that people have for me
<LI>Affirmitive Action. We need to get rid of it before it tears the social fabric apart.
<LI>Overpopulation of the earth.  Birth control, birth control 
birth control...educate and make it easy to get!  If we don't 
take care of our population problem, mother nature will, and it 
will be UGLY.
<LI>THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS/MOVE AWAY FROM THEM TO CLEANER SOYRCES OF ENERGY
<LI>The notion of ethnocentrism and cultural imperialiam - each culture should be celebrated and learnt about in order to promote greater understanding and a united yet diverse society.
<LI>the most important issue is the killing of innocent lives, including those not born, the elderly, those w/ different religous views.
<LI>Peace in the Middle East must precede Peace on Earth
<LI>We need to get crime under control in this country. We can send
men to the moon, but we can't control the criminals. I really
don't understand this. We are supposed to be the greatest and
most powerful country on earth, but we let the hoodlums and
thugs control our lives. We need to completely change our legal
system for starters. There was a time a few years ago when
people didn't even have to lock their doors or cars!!!!!
<LI>Education has to be dealt with now, we, the people in high school and college, will be inheriting this nation and the world and we must be properly educated in order to keep up with the rest of the world.  The education programs in the United States are so far behind other countries that it is not even funny.  If we as a country can't get it together then I fear we will see an end to United States reign as the the "main superpower" in today's and tomorrows world.
<LI>The threat of china.  Beef of pacific defense and make the chineese back down.
<LI>I believe that we sould impose legal bans of all abortion, expept
to save the life of the woman.  Doing so would reverse our trend of 
of Social Darwinism on all fronts.
<LI>We need to Re-Learn Responsibility and teach it to our children.
We need to become a better society by learning to be a society 
that has good moral values.

<LI>Why is President Clinton the only US President in history to need a legal defence fund? 
<LI>We should start to exterminate any form of religion.
We should start thinking about population growth (we should decrease it)

<LI>Overpopulation.   Education is the key to solving
this and all problems in our global village.
<LI>I think that the most important issue time being that 
has always existed is violence.Can't we just get along.
<LI>Abortion- It must be abolished because it is the murder of innocent human beings, healthy or not.
<LI>The environment. We need to expand, cultivate, and prohibit human activity in wild lands.
<LI>Erosion of our soceity's civility and morality.
This is like etiquite, it needs to be taught by parents, 
in schools, on TV and from our government. 
We must tolerate each other to continue to exist on this planet.
<LI>The debt and employment are equally the main problems

<LI>Libertarians should rule the World.
<LI>Drugs and greed will bring us down.
<LI>I BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF WE 
WITHDRAW ALL MILITARY AND MONETARY PARTICIPATION FROM 
ALL OTHER COUNTRYS.  WE SHOULD FOCUS ON HELPING 
OURSELVES.
<LI>Affirmative action is out of control.  It is so obvious that it is reverse discrimination!  We have to get rid of it and trust people to hire people based on merit, not color.
<LI>We need to stop the "war on drug" - we have lost this war and are 
making criminals our of too many Americans - Stop putting productive
American people in jail - thus limiting their future.
<LI>I think that world peace is the most important issues.
Until all nations are united many of our problems will not be conquerable.
<LI>Give more protection to endangered species.
<LI>The break down of the family unit and the idea that people are not responsible for their own actions.  IE. The public or a piece thereof making excuses for certain behaviors be they criminal or otherwise because 'they were abused as a child' or 'they came from a poor family' etc.  Not to say we don't need to address poverty etc but, it can't be an excuse for not living by the laws of society.  We need to find a way to strengthen families and impress upon people that they are responsible for themselves.
 You can't legislate morality it has to come for the person's upbringing and the government can't provide that.  Sorry I got a bit carried away and did a 'little' more than 2 sentences...  
<LI>Our current 'cultural diversity' policies are deadly.  Bosnia is the diversity end-game we're heading towards.
<LI>I feel we need to Get the Debt taken care of... NO MATTER what the 
consequenses are: either We starve a little now or OUR children will strave
their whole life.
<LI>Loss of the principles of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. Repeal the 16th amendment, abolish the IRS and the Federal Reserve Board and return the nation to the gold standard.
<LI>Serious crime (i.e. murders) in the U.S. and around the world. Not sure what we need to do, but innocent people, children are murdered for no reason, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Some people are just "sick".
<LI>The decay of values. People get away with too much. When there is a law on the books it should be enforced.
<LI>CONTRACTURAL AGREEMENTS:  The heterosexual community has historically proven that such "marriage" contracts -- the right: to sleep together; pollute the school system with kids; avoid responsibility -- is there recognized DOMAIN (generally).  The homosexual community seeks contractural "recognition" of their level of RESPONSIBILITY (do not call it a MARRIAGE, please.)  The advent of "test tube babies" effectively forces -- the concept of MARRIAGE, to be archaic.  There WILL ALWAYS be differences in the
HUMAN CONDITION to establish:  the pursuit of happiness.  (Yes, I am homosexual.  Had a partner for 30+ years.  Remain HIV-negative and DO NOT subscribe to the so called MAIN STREAM defination of "gay". There's NOT enough room here to elaborate.  You'd be pleased to be my neighbor; I yours -- probably :)
<LI>The spending level of the federal government. They need to start 
living within thier means without taxing us into the poorhouse.
<LI>We must vastly reduce entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
<LI>Bob Dole Rules!  Clinton willl be inpeached!
<LI>ETHICS IN POLITICS.  WE NEED TO START WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON DOWN AND CLEAN HOUSE OF ALL THE SCREWBALLS WE CURRENTLY HAVE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY.
<LI>The war on drugs and the drastic erosion of civil liberties in America
as the United States becomes the leading jailing nation in the world. 
<LI>Federal debt, federal regulation, and the size of the federal
government.  Solution; abolish the IRS.
<LI>To reduce big government. Taxation has become the means to support
the promises made by politicians, not to run an effective government.
<LI>Welfare for able-bodied humans should be eliminated! Education should be mandatory -- advancement and graduation must be based on competency rather than age. If you can't read, write and speak proper English, and if you can't do math or locate the US on the globe, you FLUNK! (If you're 30 years old and still in high school, too damn bad!)
<LI>Accessible and affordable health care for everyone and more emphasis on elementary and secondary education
<LI>I think making a college education affordable to all is very important...education, in my opinion, is the key to a better society and world.

<LI>clinton-throw him out!
<LI>The government is too intrusive and wastes far too much of our money.  Taxes should be lowered and the IRS abolished.  Steve Forbes was right;
<LI>Social Security - come up with an entirely new plan and start adding to the fund today so that when it runs out maybe people under 30 today will have something. I would pay extra now to have something when I retire. I am 25/Male.
<LI>In 2012 Social Security expenditures will exceed revenues.  The system is in drastic need of reform.  Privitzation is the only logical answer.
<LI>Crime, especially murder.  We need to teach people that killing is not right.  We need for people to unite together to fight the war against crime.
<LI>Many issues contain the element of acceptance - accepting those who are different from us, whether they are of a different race, religion or sexual orientation.  Many, many problems could begin to be solved if people accepted others and cared about the problems that they face, rather than only worrying about one's own self & immediate family.
<LI>Drugs -- too many kids see it as glamorous because the Say No campaign of the 1980s lied. It really is glamorous -- until you're hooked.
<LI>dsdsdsdfsdf
<LI>Quality and Cost of Education
<LI>We need kids to learn the basicin school at early age. 
Reading,writing,and math
<LI>prevention, intervention, and education
<LI>Diseases such as Aids and Cancer and societal problems such as gangs and drugs and violence.
<LI>Political shift to the right.  It needs to be corrected so that "Liberal" is again elevated to be a thing to be looked up at not looked down upon.
<LI>Violence.  I'm not sure what to do to change it, but it seems to be getting worse.  

<LI>education
<LI>Too damn much government at all levels. We need to somehow
develop enough respect for each other to allow others to make
their own mistakes and enjoy their own successes.
<LI>The fundamental problem is the continual political exploitation of race and ethnicity, all over the world, which has led to any number of wars, international and civil.
Another basic problem is that in the last ten to twenty years, the gap between rich and poor (people and countries) has increased within and between nations; and no one is stopping the inevitable conflict.
<LI>The aging of America
<LI>Gun control. We must stop these comunist bastards from taking
away our second amendment rights.
<LI>the most important issue is integrity in public office
there should be zero-tolerance for crooked politians
<LI>National debt.  If we do not do something to reduce the national debt, I believe that we will see a global economic collapse far worse than any depression that the United States has ever seen.  We are borrowing from our future with every second that passes and therefore inhibiting the future of our young people.
<LI>Education is the most important issue.  The children are our future.  They need to be informed of what our society is all about.

<LI>Health care and the environment
<LI>We need to halt the slide into total immorality that our society is on. How?  By returning to the fundamental moral and religious values our country was founded on instead of trying to rewrite history to omit that fact.  Why?  Let me quote George Washington in his 1789 Inaugural Address: "The propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained."
<LI>I like to suck massive johnson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its good!!!!!!
<LI>The guy outside my window with a chainsaw...
<LI>ssssssssssssssssssssssspppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppoooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<LI>I don't want the fish poisoned.
<LI>responsibility -- -- especially govt.  
<LI>The most important issue is education.  The masses of American children need a better education than they are getting in todays schools.  Even if it means cyber-schools. Americans can not compete in a global market ecomony without...stricter, better and more efficient schools.
<LI>same sex marriage and gay rights...give equal rights under the law to all
<LI>Probably the most important problem in our country is health care costs and a common sense, but viable solution for some form of universal coverage for Americans. 
<LI>The war on drugs, although established with the best of intensions, erodes our civil liberties by expansion of police powers.  I believe the money wasted on jails and law enforcement resulting from the war on drugs would ultimately benefit society the most if spent on schools and education instead.
<LI>The most important issue facing individuals is the lack of personal responsibility- we must beginn taking responsibility for our actions.  The most important issue facing the world is the need for sustainable development.
<LI>Americans should become involved in governing themselves. If you don't vote you don't have a right to bitch when something agree with your principles!
<LI>analysis of current policies for hinderance to the growth of GDP. The world is catching up; if we can use our capital to finance their growth, we shall prosper in the end!!
<LI>The politics of equality. While I greatly respect the Islamic and Christian faiths, I
fear that they spread a consistent attitude toward disowing over half of the population. 
Women are the majority, not an afterthought.
<LI>I think education and prevention are the key to most of our social issues.  If people were more open about issues and talked with each other and our children about them we could abolish many problems.  We need to solve the economic problems we face in the US before we can solve many of our social ills.
<LI>Bring respect back to the presidency, by impeaching the current clown.
<LI>moral decay
<LI>homosexuallity--- I firmly believe a couple should be able to marry on another,regardless of sexual preference.
<LI>The most important issue facing us today is poverty and the decline in family values. These two issues are very closley related and affect every part of our lives, from drug abuse to child abuse to homelessness and crime. Poverty causes hopelessness which leads to many other problems.
<LI>The AIDS crisis. Thousands of people are dieing daily and we need to find a cure.
<LI>The most important issue today is cleanup officials in Washington. We need to get
the old ones out who has been robbering us for years. The rich gets richer and the 
poor gets poorer. "Vote"..!!
<LI>We must stop imprisoning people for victimless crimes. Drug addiction is not a crime. LEGALIZE DRUGS.
<LI>The moral decay that has taken over. I feel that if preachers were
preaching the Gospel as the Bible teaches, this would not be an issue.
<LI>Less constriction of individual rights/privacy.  (Less "big
brother")
<LI>Nuclear proliferation. We need to stabilize the former Soviet Union.
<LI>Proactive reduction of American people to 
an undereducated, dependent group of stupid sheep.  
<LI>The government is too big, the national debt is too big, the U.S.
Constitution is not followed, the federal courts have gone nuts.
<LI>Immigrants should not be allowed to come into the United States.
They are taking away valuable jobs that us Americans need to survive.
They can afford to take jobs at a lower payscale than Americans
because they can live in public houseing programs, and use food stamps.
They deplete the taxes of programs that the American workers paid 
the tax to support in the first place.  
I am an honest hardworking American, my skin is white, I am not
elgible for public housing breaks, food stamps, or educational
grants.  To survive both my Wife and I work a full time job. 
I am attending school in hopes that I can someday get a position
that pays a wage high enough so we may purchase a house, my Wife
will be able to stay at home and raise our children as a traditionl
nuclear family.  I also wanted to add, many of the immigrants at 
my school have there classes paid for in full by the United States
Government.  I have to take out loans to pay for my classes.  Also
I have an Associates Degree, and am unable to find a position that
pays a wage to support a family, or even myself.
<LI>We, as a country, need to guard OUR coasts and bother only the countries that pose a threat to our country.

<LI>Developping contries
<LI>Public apathy has allowed the U.S. government to become an oligarchy.  We need more citizen involvement to regain control of our own government. 
<LI>It's important to support the President, and not be distracted by 
accusations. The pres should lead, not be on a witness stand.
<LI>Using the talents of everyone - eliminating discrimination based on race, sex, religion.  Encourage inclusion as government priority and social priority.  Make discrimination morally, socially, and politically unacceptable
<LI>Total disarmament of US army. Spend the money on those who need it.
<LI>Now the election is over I'm glad Bob Dole won
<LI>Government (over)involvement is a problem. They want to "help" us out in many 
ways, but in doing this, it also takes away our rights a little 
each time. We are moving to a socialist nation.
<LI>What America needs is a good 5 cent blow-job.
<LI>I THINK THE CONTINUED PERSECUTION OF OJ SIMPSON IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING AMERICA.  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!
<LI>Get rid of Clinton. I wanted Bob Dole to win!

<LI>Downsizing government and reducing government regulations.  Returning power to the states and the individual.
<LI>Impeach the President and Vice President
<LI>The right of individuals to choose, their life partners, reproductive decisions, health and aging issues.
<LI>National morals in britain need to be addressed. Too many people just dont care about anything.

<LI>The balanced budget, higher minimum wage, tax cut for middle class and tax the rich more
<LI>I think the world is moving to fast.  People are becoming more and more introverted it seems.

<LI>Raising the educational standards in the US.  We are not as proficient 
as other industrial countries and we do not equal opportunity to a
good education.
<LI>I feel that we should provide humanitarian and military aid if we are not in danger of losing many lives.
