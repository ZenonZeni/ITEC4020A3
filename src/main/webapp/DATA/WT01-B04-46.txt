<A NAME="AircraftInsp"><H3>Miniaturization Technologies for Aircraft Inspection</h3></a><p>

This task for the U.S. Air Force studies how to apply miniaturization technologies to aircraft inspection to make existing inspection processes more efficient and to enable new inspection modalities.  Regular inspection of aircraft is critical for safety and to determine what and when repairs are needed.  Aircraft inspection can be both time consuming and difficult because of the size of aircraft, such as external inspection of the C-5A, and because of difficult access, such as internal engine and fuel tank inspection.  Recent advances in miniaturization technologies have produced technologies enabling development of new inspection systems to enhance aircraft inspection.<p>

The four objectives of the Miniaturization Technologies for Aircraft Inspection task are to<p>
<UL>
<LI>Determine aircraft inspection application areas that could most greatly benefit from the application of miniaturization technologies.
<LI>Evaluate the current state of the art in aircraft inspection technologies with primary focus on small and miniature technologies.
<LI>Identify for development promising candidate miniaturization technologies that would benefit aircraft inspection applications.
<LI>Develop a plan for development of target technologies and their application to aircraft inspection.

<A NAME="ObstacleDet"><H3>Obstacle Detection for Autonomous Ground Vehicles</h3></a><p>

Autonomous ground vehicles are being developed for a variety of applications in the military, in hazardous waste remediation, and in planetary exploration.  Such applications often involve limitations on communications that require such a vehicle to navigate autonomously for extended distances and extended periods of time.  Under these circumstances, the vehicle must be equipped with sensors for detecting obstacles in its path.  JPL is developing obstacle detection sensors for the "Demo II" Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Program, which is sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.<p>

The goal of the Demo II Program is to develop technology enabling ground vehicles to perform autonomous scouting missions.  In its full generality, this application will require operating during the day or night, in clear or obscured weather conditions, and over terrain that will include a variety of natural and human-made obstacles.  Obstacle detection sensors must be able to perceive terrain geometry and the material type of any ground cover (terrain type), an do so at night and through haze.<p>

The JPL task has been addressing the problem of perceiving daytime and nighttime terrain geometry and is beginning to address the problem of perceiving terrain type by day.  For sensing geometry, stereovision is being used; its properties of being nonemissive, nonscanning, and nonmechanical make it attractive for military vehicles that require a low-signature sensor performing well while jostling over rough terrain.  In collaboration with other laboratories, the JPL task has recently begun experimenting with stereovision and thermal imagery to address night operations.  For sensing terrain type, preliminary investigations have been conducted that use visible, near-infrared, and polarization imagery to discriminate soil, vegetation, and water.<p>

Over the past five years, the JPL task has developed a real-time stereovision system that currently produces range imagery from a 256- x 45-pixel window of attention in about 0.6 second per frame, using a Datacube MV-200 image-processing board and a 68040 central-processing-unit board as the sole computing engines.  This vision system is installed on a roboticized modern military jeep that serves as a testbed UGV.  Enhancements currently in progress on this system include the addition of algorithms for real-time obstacle detection, focus of attention, and software-based lens aperture control.  The vision system has been used to drive the jeep autonomously at speeds up to 10 kilometers per hour.  This work has been the first to show that stereovision can provide range data of sufficient quality, at sufficient speeds, and with sufficiently small computing resources to be practical for autonomous vehicle navigation.  Future work will attempt to increase the quality of the range data, miniaturize the computing system, and integrate terrain classification with range imaging.<p>

<A NAME="BioRobotics"><H3>Biologically Inspired Robotics</h3></a><p>

This task explores the use of legged robots in environments typical for various military missions.  It is supported by a basic research grant from the Office of Naval Research and is a part of that office's Perceptual Sciences Program.  Focusing on issues related to the control of legged robots that perform extended autonomous operations, the task investigates the feasibility of such concepts for Navy operations in shallow waters, such as surveillance and mine discharging.  the resulting technologies also address some f the issues related to planetary exploration on surfaces that might be more rocky than the Viking Lander-1 and -2 sites and provide the design tools and test data necessary for the investigation of legged rovers for future NASA missions.<p>

The problem of controlling legged robots has been perceived as a complex one, possibly requiring extensive computation.  This is, perhaps, one of the reasons for the choice of wheeled rovers over legged rovers in many military, civilian, and space applications, where the constraints on mass, power, and/or computational requirements often have a compelling impact on vehicle design.  On the other hand, there exists a rich spectrum of simple biological systems that perform stable locomotion with relative ease in the presence of large amounts of uncertainties.  It is therefore natural to seek biological principles that might simplify control and improve mechanical design, so that legged concepts may become competitive enough for serious consideration in a variety of applications.<p>

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of biological locomotion is the notion of a gait, and the study of underlying mechanisms used for choosing, modifying, and maintained gaits.  A gait is quantified by the phase relationship maintained between the motions of individual legs and appears to be related to the overall stability of the animal performing locomotion.  The premise of the research conducted in this task, therefore, is that a systematic study of gait modeling and gait control could result in computationally efficient locomotion controllers.<p>

To date, a simple gait model has been developed for the emulation of two-, four-, and six-legged gaits, and a locomotion control architecture has been determined for choosing, adapting, and maintaining gaits.  JPL has built a six-legged robot, about 0.4 meter long, 0.25 meter wide, and about 0.1 meter in height.  The control programs that drive the legs have been developed and tested.  Programs are being developed to enable coordinated movement of the legs for stable locomotion on rough terrain.  Currently, experiments are being performed indoors to be followed by a series of outdoor tests in the near future.<p>

the payoff for the Navy from such an investigation lies in the realization of vehicles that could operate autonomously in the near-surf zone in beaches as well as on a wide variety of terrains, and perform surveillance and mine-discharging operations.  The payoff for NASA would be the realization of rover concepts for autonomous operation on extremely rocky surfaces, such as descending into volcanic craters.  In addition, microinstruments and microsampling devices could be packaged within the lets of such a robot, so that geological surveying and sampling could potentially occur even while the rover is navigating from one site to another.  The legs could also be utilized as deployment mechanisms.<p>
