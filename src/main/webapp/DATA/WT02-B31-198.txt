Romeo and Juliet was a good movie but very odd and hard to understand! I would not recomend you to go see it If you're under 15.

Hi i just came back from seeing THE GLIMMER MAN and it is one of Segal's best yet. In this Segal is a newly transferred L.A. cop Jack Cole on the trail of a serial killer dubbed the family man. He is teamed up with a partner (Keenen Ivory Wayans) and they set about solving the case which will lead all the way to the C.I.A. headquarters itself. It really is a must see.<BR>

hey everybody!<BR>

i don't get out very much as you will probably think, i went and saw the brady bunch sequel the other day and i did not like it. i went in with high expectations of it and came out thinking that i could have spent my money on something more worthwhile. was the bit in the airplane supposed to be funny? and i know in the old version of the brady bunch everybody kept saying, 'oh Alice!' and why did she live in the fridge? in general i like sequels as they are usually in keeping with the first one, but i have to say that this was one of the worst sequels ever!! does anybody out there agree with me?<BR>

that is all i have to say now! byeeeee!! DISAPPOINTED, PERTH, WA.

Recently saw Romeo & Juliet and thought that it was absolutely superb. I can't understand why the Yank critics gave it a real panning. (Possibly because they have no idea what to look for in reviewing a film). I thought Baz Luhrman did a fantastic job as director. The style was original and for the most part kept the intensity of the storyline going. The cinematography was cohesive and kept the text alive. As far as the storyline in itself - I couldn't tell if a folio or quarto text was used but it still remained true to the story. Whoever the editor was deserves an Academy Award.<BR>


This modern day version of Shakespeare's text works. It beats the hell out of a BBC or Bertolluci version any day! <BR>

hi everybody,<BR>


i have been 2 the cinemas lately and saw Maximum Risks, Dragonheart, Space Jam, in which i thought the last 2 movies were good, but as 4 Van-Damme's movies, they aren't getting any better, they are getting worse!. Maximum Risks was in fact a MAXIMUM waste of time....the plot is ridiculous, while certain scene that wasn't meant 2 happen, happened. 4 example, Van-Damme and Henstridge in the bathroom, while being held captive, with the 'FBI kidnappers' next door!!!!!!, now how pathetic is that????. <BR>


Dragonheart was good, only if u like mythology and creation (but of course u don't have 2). i thought it was very creative, imaginative, great special EFX, Sean Connery was fantastic as Draco's voice (just as James Earl Jones is 4 Darth Vader and in the Lion King....i love voices that actors do 4 movies..if u guys haven't noticed!!). while Space Jam was better than any other b'ball movies made by NBA stars...not 2 mention Shaq's floppy, money greedy movies, that consisted of poor acting and poorly done in every aspect!!.<BR>


anybody seen Jingle All The Way, Romeo and Juliet, Daylight, Fly Away Home (i know it is a kids flick, but i always dreamt of that happening 2 me, since i was a kid!) or Hotel de Love, if so send comments 2 cheah@carmen.murdoch.edu.au comments are very welcome!!!!!!! <BR>


take care,<BR>

Hi Everyone!
I recently saw 101 Dalmations and thought it was cool. It was very funny, better than the cartoon version. I know that its late, but Independence Day was great, one of the best movies i've ever seen.<BR>
Anyway, gotta go,

Hi,
I thought that the movie Star Trek - The First Contact would be really boring. So my friend asked me to go and see the movie with her and I did go with her. I found it very enjoyable and it was not what I expected.I recommend that people should go and see this movie!!<BR>

Hi! My name is Mark,
The following will be extremely cliche but true. If you only go see one film this year Please! Please! Please! do yourself a favour and see Romeo and Juliet. Trust an Aussie director with the name Baz to turn what could have been a typical big budget Hollywood film into an instant classic. 1995 the film of the year was Pulp Fiction, 1996 the film was Trainspotting and 1997 the film is Romeo and Juliet. It has an amazing cast, costumes, sets, cinematography and one of the worlds best scripts. It is brave, brash and stylish! The poetic lines of Shakespeare will pull out your heart and it will beat like never before in front of your eyes. For me it was like Peter Castaldi said "...without doubt, one of the best films of my film going life". *****1/2 stars

Just saw Romeo and Juliet three times, it was the best movie. I thought it would be a cheap version of a beautiful story but it wasn't and I was really impressed. Does anyone else agree Leo is the hottest babe on this earth along with the best young actor?

I went to see Romeo and Juliet on Boxing Day, and was completely astonished by it's brilliance. It is the best film I've seen in a long time. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire danes are both fantastic. The soundtrack is also a must to get(unfortunately it is sold out in just about every music store in Melbourne). I was so impressed and in love with the film that I saw it again (3 days later) and loved it even more. The costumes, settings and acting is great. But I noticed that Romeo didn't kill Paris in it as he does in the play, hmmm. Anyway,if I had the chance I would see this film a million times over this summer. But due to a low cash problem I might be able to see it only one more time! Thanx<BR>

Hiya everybody!<BR>

I have got to agree with Rowan ( Yes that's a girl's name) when I say that Romeo and Juliet (especially Juliet!) was a brilliant movie.
I went and saw it the day that it came out with a friend, then again the next day with another friend and tonight with my girlfriend. 
Rowen, it must be something about Canadians. I am origionally from Mission, Vancouver, B.C, Canada, although I have since moved to Australia.
Well, gotta go! if anybody's wants to reply, I am at dalai@fastlink.com.au
C-ya's round like Romeo's ring,<BR>

Hi,
I just wanted to tell everyone to see 'Romeo and Juliet" because it is so good and Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are fantastic. Caroline, I have seen "Fargo" but I didn't think that it was as good as everyone has said. I hated the woodchipper scene. "Welcome To The Dollhouse" is really good.<BR>
Thanks,
Elisa.

to everyone,
I have just seen Daylight and I personally thought it was a DISGRACE!!!!It had abolutely no storyline and was pathetic.What was the point of the film? That people get stuck in an underground tunnel and 'Stallone' saves the day!! Get me a bucket!!!! I recommend not to waste your money on this film. I rate it 1 out of 10.<BR>

To all movie lovers,
My friends and I have just seen Romeo And Juliet. I highly recommend to see it if you haven't.Leonardo Dicaprio performs perfectly in his part as Romeo and Claire Danes was a perfect Juliet.It is great for people aged 12 and up , and you don't need to understand Shakespeare to catch the drift. I give it a definite 10 out of 10 and will be buying the video as soon as it is released. The story line is easily understood and the costuming makes the movie fit in with the present time. Romeo and Juliet is definetely the love story of all time and i will be seeing it again.<BR>

From your fellow movie -lover.

Hi gurus

Just seen the movie Michael Collins and thought it was brilliant. I know a little of Irish history and found this movie to be fair and accurate. If anyone would like to begin to understand how irish people feel about their country or would like to try and put some sense to what is happening there today then this is definately recommended. Also look out for a movie in the near future about modern irish republicans, it is called "Some mothers son" and stars Brad Pitt and Meryl Streep.

Hi !

Just saw That Thing You Do on a flight to Melbourne, Tom Hanks is great and that song is very catchy I think it is a must see, even with it's obvious simalarities to another popular band of it's time. I give it 4 stars, go and see it.

In the past few months, i've seen a few movies. Star Trek - First Contact, Ransom, and Romeo & Juliet. I think they are all BRILLIANT movies, and they all deserve 10 out of 10<BR>

I am absolutely sick of going to the theatre and finding inconsiderate people chatting, whispering, laughing uncontrollably when nothing is funny at all, and, most of all, putting gum all over the seats, drink holders, aisle ...<BR>
 I suggest that bubble gum and chewing gum be banned all together from the theater. Like Patrick, I think that Steve's idea is a little farfetched. I think theater police is going overboard. But I wouldn't mind the problem being taken a little more seriously. These disrespectful people make the theatre uncomfortable and sticky. Having ID's and holes punched or whatever isn't really necessary, but suspension to those inconsiderate people is a great idea. I'm not a racist, but I also suggest that those people who don't understand English just don't go to these movies, rather than bring a translator and talk the whole way through what could be a pretty good movie.

Hi All,

I thought that 101 Dalmations was a very versatile movie meaning that 5 year olds to 85 year olds can watch it. Keep the good work up Greater Union.

I've been reading all the comments and thought that I too should add my 2 cents worth..I'd just like to say that I really enjoyed SpaceJam and recommend all the people out there who love to laugh to go and see it, oh yeah, don't get put off from the idea that it's a cartoon, afterall, cartoons are the best way to make people laugh and everyone can enjoy them.<BR>

Stay cool, watch movies and have a great new year... C.......
