<P>
 When investors put money into a mutual fund,
it is pooled with money from other investors to create a larger
portfolio than most individuals could create by investing on 
their own. Most funds diversify their holdings by
buying a wide variety of investments. The portfolio created may
include stocks, bonds or other securities and is managed by a
professional investment company. Since a fund can own dozens or 
even hundreds of different securities, its success or failure
is not going to be dependent on how well a handful of securities
perform. Each mutual fund has a professional money manager who
builds and manages the fund's portfolio in accordance with its
stated investment objective.

<P>
In order to invest in a mutual fund, an investor
buys shares of the fund and becomes a shareholder. A mutual fund
makes money in two ways: by earning dividends or interest on its
investments and by selling investments that have appreciated in
price. The fund pays out, or distributes, its profits (less fees
and expenses) to its shareholders. Most funds offer investors
the option of reinvesting all or part of their distributions in
the fund by buying more shares.

<P>
From an investment perspective, mutual funds
make sense and are most profitable when they are held for the
long term. They should not be treated as transaction accounts
because of the sales or redemption charges and potential tax liabilities.
