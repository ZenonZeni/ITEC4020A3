Biomarkers Trace
Oil Spill Sources

Biomarker compounds have long been used to identify petroleum
deposits, fingerprint the sources of oil spills, and monitor the
oil weathering process. However, in highly degraded oil, many oil
components such as the n-alkanes, branched alkanes, and PAHs can be
lost and unavailable as biomarkers.

Working with the Minerals Management Service (Washington, DC; Tel:
202/208-3983), Zhendi Wang and Merv Fingas of the Emergencies
Science Div. (Environmental Technology Centre, Environment Canada,
3439 River Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0H3, Canada) have developed
a method of using biomarker compounds such as triterpanes and
steranes, compounds which are highly resistant to weathering. The
analytical methods were designed to identify, characterize and
quantify oil samples having various forms, natures and
concentrations.

The researchers noted that using biomarkers to track the source of
spilled oil and to monitor weathered oil has several advantages as
compared to other approaches, including the following:

    Each oil type has a different compound distribution

    Triterpanes and steranes are highly resistant to degradation

    Triterpanes and steranes are accurately measured using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry

    Biomarker compounds are often more abundant in highly
weathered oils

    Ratios of certain biomarkers can more accurately indicate the
extent of biodegradation than the traditional methods

The study showed that sources of oil spills could be tracked by
comparing the distribution patterns of biomarker compounds and the
relative ratios of selected paired hopanes in spilled oil samples
with reference oils. The researchers found that the relative ratios
of C29-hopane to C30-hopane were more resistant to degradation than
other ratioed pairs of hopanes.

C29-Hopane and C30-hopane were often the most abundant hopanes,
allowing the most accurate measurements. Comparing the ratios of
C29-hopane to C30-hopane in weathered and unweathered oil samples
resulted in a more accurate value for the degree of biodegradation
than traditional aliphatic-isoprenoid hydrocarbon ratios.  For more
information, see "Using Biomarker Compounds to Track the Source of
Spilled Oil and to Monitor the Oil Weathering process," in LC GC
[13, No. 12, 1995].

Skylab's Reversible
Transformation

Guy I. Z. Kalocsai of Skylab International Ltd. (Valletta, Malta)
has developed a method for reversibly transforming organic
compounds into a phase more suitable for subsequent handling but
from which the original organic compounds can be readily recovered.
The invention is particularly suited for the recovery and re-use of
liquid hydrocarbons, either naturally occurring or synthetic,
and/or their derivatives, and it is expected to be especially
useful in the recovery of hydrocarbons from an oil spill and for a
variety of other applications.

Traditional methods of attempting to clean up oil spills include
(1) the use of oil-skimming boats and containment booms; (2)
bombarding the floating oil with chemical dispersants; and (3)
bioremediation, whereby oil-consuming bacteria are dumped on the
oil. However, none of these current methods are considered
satisfactory as significant quantities of the oil spilled cannot
seemingly be recovered or dispersed by any of these methods and
pollution of the environment can continue for many years
afterwards.

Kalocsai found that if a hydrocarbon(s) is contacted with one or
more particular reagents, an absorbent can be produced which
absorbs substantially all of the hydrocarbon(s). The elasticity of
the product which is formed can readily be controlled from elastic,
through viscous liquid to plastic or brittle solid in an efficient
and rapid manner. The original hydrocarbon can be readily recovered
from this product.

By using this method (U.S. Patent 5,468,261), a spilled hydrocarbon
is modified to produce an elastic compound which can be readily
retrieved from a body of water by towing, pushing or skimming the
elastic material from the surface of the water or by using spiked
rollers connected between two vessels which, on rotation, can roll
up the elastic material.

The method can be used to treat only the perimeter of an oil spill
to produce a containment barrier for the remaining, untreated
hydrocarbon,  eliminating the need for artificial booms and
barriers. A system using this method can be carried on vessels or
housed on site to prevent serious oil or similar spillage or leaks
and to be used in the neutralizing and clean-up or salvage of
hydrocarbon leaks or spills.

The hydrocarbon may be a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved or
trapped in a suitable medium. The hydrocarbon may be soluble or
insoluble in water, with best results obtained for hydrocarbons
which are insoluble in water. Preferred hydrocarbons include
ethers; petroleum based liquids including kerosene, petroleum,
crude oil; aromatic compounds, for example, toluene; ketones such
as methyl iso-butyl ketone; natural and refined animal, mineral and
vegetable oils, for example, sunflower oil. Preferably, the first
reagent to be used should be an organic or inorganic acid, salt or
base which is insoluble in water but soluble in the hydrocarbon or
its derivative.

Preferably, the organic acid is a fatty acid (stearic, oleic,
palmitic and levulinic acids, etc.). The preferred choice for the
second reagent depends on the end product required. An alkali
(ammonia, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate or
organic alkaline reagents) should be used for a granular product.
A solution of an elastomer or a latex should be used for a semi-
elastic product, and for a more elastic product a solution of an
elastomer or a latex is followed by the addition of an aqueous
acetate solution should be used. Any organic or metal acetate can
be used, such as ammonium acetate and zinc acetate.

This method for the reversible transformation of hydrocarbons can
also be applied for a wide range of purposes which include
manufacturing solid or viscous liquid compounds for plastics
production, storing and/or transporting volatile, unstable,
environmentally sensitive or toxic hydrocarbons, effectively
absorbing liquid hydrocarbon compounds, and sealing leaking or
damaged containers of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.

It might also convert volatile liquid hydrocarbons to less
volatile, more manageable compounds or be used to quell oil well
fires by converting the oil to a candle-like consistency which
burns at a much lower temperature than the untreated oil and which
is thus much easier to extinguish.

Persian Gulf:
Where's the Oil?

During the war with Iran, millions of gallons of oil spilled on
land and at sea. Following the war, scientists surveyed the Persian
Gulf to track the impact of the massive oil spill. Researchers have
found that both land and sea are recovering through the help of
naturally occurring microbes.

Oil pollution along some shores has rapidly disappeared while
simultaneously microbial mats, thick layers of microbes, were
growing on top of the oil. To understand how the microbial mats
were absorbing and breaking down the oil, the Dept. of Defense is
funding a study of the microbial mats at Northwestern University
(Evanston, IL).

"All we know at this point is that sunlight seems to enhance the
activity of the mats in breaking down the oil," reports David A.
Stahl, associate professor of civil engineering (McCormick School
of Engineering and Applied Science, Northwestern Univ., Evanston,
IL; Tel: 708/-491-4997). "It may be that the microbes that use
photosynthesis are doing the job, or it may be that their
byproducts are being used by another microbe in the mat community,
making it possible for them to do the job," he said.

Stahl receives new microbial mats every few months, which he tests
using the latest molecular biology methods. Stahl says that
probably far less than 1% of the microbial world has been
identified, making his research largely that of finding and
characterizing new forms of microbial life.

Samir Radwan of the University of Kuwait (Safat, Kuwait) reports
that wild flowers are growing in the oil soaked desert. While the
shoots of the plant have an oil stained ring at its base, the roots
are oil free and healthy. Radwan believes that the roots
"recruited" oil degrading microbes naturally found in the soil.
Radwan and his team cultured bacteria and fungi found in the oil
sand and found many well known oil degrading microbes consisting of
Arthrobacter bacteria. Just 1 cm away from the roots was a
completely different community of oil degrading bacteria and fungi.


Laboratory experiments replicated what was observed in the desert.
Radwan believes that rich nutrients such as sugars, available
oxygen, amino acids and vitamins attract petroleum-degrading
microbes.

The researchers recommend that suitable plants be densely
cultivated in polluted desert areas for bioremediation. This
approach may also be applicable in polluted areas in other parts of
the world.

Non-Cryogenic N2
Production Units

Generon Systems Inc. (400 W. Sam Houston Pkwy. South, Houston, TX
77042; Tel: 713/978-3100, Fax: 713/978-3185) provides on site
nitrogen generation for the oil and gas industry. Over 200 oil and
gas wells have been drilled over the last two years using Generon's
GenisisTM nitrogen production units (NPUs). These units work with
existing oil field air compression equipment and can provide from
500-3,000 standard cubic feet per minute of gaseous nitrogen in
purities from 90-99.5% oxygen free.

"Generon also sells smaller NPU systems and we have had several
requests for these systems in Texas to evaluate their use for
nitrogen flooding for enhanced oil recovery," John Koenst, product
manager for Generon, told EERN.

The Generon membrane module contains polymer hollow fiber membranes
which separate gas components of the compressed air stream. Each
membrane fiber is about the size of a human hair with a round bore
through the center. Dry, clean, compressed air passes through the
fiber bundle. It is the varying rates of permeation of nitrogen and
oxygen molecules that form the basis of Generon membrane separation
technology. "Fast" gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor diffuse through the membrane walls more quickly than
nitrogen, which is concentrated inside the fibers and delivered as
the product gas. The nitrogen product exits the end of each module
and is collected at the outlet manifold for delivery.

Nitrogen from a GENISYS NPU, used with traditional air drilling
equipment, can provide lower drilling costs, reduce the use of
drill mud and mud chemicals, and lessen the surface damage and
environmental impact often associated with other drilling methods.
Similar to air drilling operations, GENISYS systems deliver an
extremely low density drilling "fluid" that can significantly
reduce drilling time because of improved rates of penetration. The
inert, non-reactive nature of gaseous nitrogen is such that it will
not support combustion. Because of this, any risk of down hole
fires, explosions and associated tool damage are virtually
eliminated when using GENISYS NPUs. GENISYS systems are self
contained, incorporating the Generon nitrogen producing, hollow
fiber membrane modules and systems.

A benefit of GENISYS Nitrogen Production Units (NPUs) is that they
will reduce the risk of burnoffs commonly encountered when drilling
with plain compressed air. As little as 5% probability of a burnoff
is high enough to justify the use of a GENISYS NPU. The cost of a
GENISYS NPU in a typical West Texas area drilling location adds
about $0.88 per drilled foot. This is in contrast to the $2.00 per
foot added for extra water, chemicals, bit wear and the unknown
cost of a burnoff due to mud rings.

Coiled tubing operations with nitrogen from Generon's GENISYS
product line may reduce well costs and maximize recovery, all at
once. Oil and gas well completions and workovers with coiled tubing
are a proven method of reducing total well costs and maximizing
recovery from the reservoir. High pressure GENISYS nitrogen is
introduced continuously to the tubing instead of more costly,
delivered liquid nitrogen.

Experience with GENISYS NPUs has shown that using nitrogen in place
of misted, compressed air is a safer and more economical method of
drilling. Drilling with mist is slower than drilling with nitrogen
and 30% more compressed air is required for the "misting up." This
increased capacity results in the need for additional or larger air
compressors to do the job, adding costs to the drilling operation.
Using nitrogen from Genisys will result in as much as a 50% cost
savings on most wells.

At the close of 1995, Dow Chemical announced that it would sell its
Generon subsidiary to MG Industries Inc.  MG, part of the Hoechst
Group of companies, is a mid-sized industrial gas firm.

WAG Project Success
in Salt Creek Field

At the recently held Permian Basin CO2 Conference (December 4-5,
1995) in Midland TX, Abel Salazar of Mobil Oil discussed the case
history of the Salt Creek water-alternating-gas (WAG) project and
shared the key lessons learned from the project.  "The Salt Creek
Field phase 1 area has been a very successful WAG using CO2," said
Salazar. "The WAG project began two years and one month ago and
more than 50% of the current oil production of 27,000 bbls/day are
attributed to CO2 injection."

The Salt Creek Field covers 12,000 acres and is located in Kent
Co., TX, approximately 90 NE of Midland, TX. The field contains 178
active producers, 57 WAG or CO2 injectors and 78 water injectors.
When the project started, 18,500 bbls/day were produced. Less than
one month later, the field began to respond and one year later the
production peaked at 30,000 bbls/day. A total of 7.2 billion bbls
of oil have been produced over the two years of CO2 flooding as
part of the WAG treatment.

"Without CO2 injection, many of these wells would have been
uneconomical," said Salazar. "The biggest challenge at Salt Creek
Field is managing the producing gas oil ratio, and WAG is the
cheapest and quickest method to do this." He said that Mobil was
very happy with the WAG results and that Mobil will expand into the
phase 2 area as of March 1996 and will continue expansion into the
phase 3 area through the year 2001.

"Salt Creek Field is very dynamic and needs continuous
surveillance," Salazar explained. "The key to the success of the
CO2 injection is management. A detailed pattern analysis is
necessary, as are team work and having good communication with
field personnel."

Salazar offered some specific guidelines based on Mobil's
experience with the field. He counseled to use maximum available
carbon dioxide supply rate as long as possible from pipeline and
gas plant capacities and vary WAG ratios on a pattern by pattern
basis. WAG/breakthrough problems can be identified by watching cash
flow per producing well and not allowing the cash flow to go
negative. Apply same waterflood workover procedures during carbon
dioxide flood. Exception is for high GOR wells which require
increased mud costs. Supplement fuel may be necessary to insure
proper carbon dioxide flare operation.

Another guide is that all surface systems should be planned for
flexibility.
Remember that the vendor/engineering contractor community knows
very little about metering carbon dioxide streams at either high or
low pressures.

DOE Program Aids
Smaller Producers

Independent producers today account for nearly 40% of the nation's
domestic oil supply, but virtually none of these companies have the
technical capability or resources to try untried or unfamiliar
technological approaches that potentially could improve their
economic viability. As a result, with oil prices remaining
relatively low, many of these companies are on the verge of
abandoning much of the nation's remaining oil resource. To help
meet this need, the Dept. of Energy (DOE) (1000 Independence Ave.
SW, Washington, DC 20585; Tel: 202/586-5000) is assisting several
of the nation's smallest independent oil producers in applying
innovative technologies that could help maintain the viability of
an increasingly important segment of the U.S. petroleum industry.

DOE, working through its National Institute for Petroleum and
Energy Research (NIPER, 220 N. Virginia, Bartlesville, OK 74003;
Tel: 918/336-2400, Fax: 918/337-4339) is providing nearly $400,000
in technical assistance contracts to eight independent producers.
The producers and their project partners provide more than $500,000
in private sector cost-sharing and in-kind contributions. By
providing a small amount of federal cost-sharing, $50,000 or less
per project, the DOE is encouraging the producers to experiment
with the higher-risk approaches that could mean the difference
between maintaining production from an oil field or shutting it in.
The program is directed at companies with less than 50 employees or
contractors who have no affiliation with a major oil company.

The eight companies, and others added to the program in the future,
will be the focus of an extensive technology transfer effort to be
conducted by the DOE and BDM-Oklahoma, the operator of NIPER.
Through workshops, technical reports, and the use of expanding DOE
and industry electronic networks to the petroleum industry,
techniques and results from the trial projects will be disseminated
to other small producers.

This effort differs from the larger Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program that DOE initiated in 1992.  The Reservoir
Class program, now underway in 14 States, involves full-scale field
tests that, in most cases, are demonstrating multiple techniques
for maintaining production from fields threatened by near-term
abandonment.  The smaller effort is pinpointing specific production
problems and attempting to demonstrate lower-cost remedies, often
focusing on an individual well or group of wells.

The DOE technical assistance program remains open for independent
producers to submit proposals.  Since BDM-Oklahoma announced the
start of the small producer program last March, independent oil
field operators have submitted 37 proposals.  Those not selected
remain eligible for further consideration, and additional proposals
are being accepted.  DOE has just over $240,000 in remaining funds
set aside for this effort, and additional project selections are
expected approximately every three months through next May. :

TRRC Amends Its
Inactive Well Rule

Texas Railroad Commissioners (TRRC, Box 12967 Austin, TX 78711-
2967; Tel: 512/463-7288) have approved a rule change designed to
help more inactive oil and gas wells qualify for a state severance
tax exemption approved by the legislature. Chairman Carole Keeton
Rylander and Commissioners Barry Williamson and Charles R. Matthews
expanded provisions of the current program which encourages
operators to bring wells that have been inactive for at least three
years back on production, thereby qualifying them for up to a 10-
year exemption from state severance tax on the oil or gas they
produce.

Under the rule change, the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) will be
able to certify an eligible well as a "three year inactive well"
without it having to be brought back into production at the time of
certification. This will give the operator of a certified well the
leeway of bringing it back on tax-exempt production anytime during
the 10 years following the certification date. The new procedure
requires the operator of a certified well to file a test report
showing productive capability with the Commission before applying
to the state comptroller for the tax incentive.

"Texas is a true leader in the area of tax incentive development
and implementation," Commissioner Williamson said. "This particular
rule change will extend the life of thousands of Texas wells,
creating jobs and tax revenue and developing natural resources that
would otherwise be lost to the state."

The Three Year Inactive Well Incentive program has been an
unqualified success. Since its beginning in 1993, almost 5,500 oil
and gas wells, capable of producing 16.4 million barrels of oil and
153.8 billion cubic feet of gas a year, have been certified. The
Commission estimates the value of that production at $584 million
and the positive impact on the Texas economy at $1.7 billion.

Differing Views
on Compliance

Petroleum producers and refiners are vitally interested in the
quality of water that they can legally discharge and equally
interested in the quality of water available for their use.  An old
saying is "Don't inject any water into your well that you wouldn't
drink." Injected minerals and microbes can have disastrous effects.


The EPA's goal of maintaining and protecting surface water quality
has led the EPA to set some very low limits for a variety of
pollutants. The demanding EPA requirements for testing and
reporting have prompted some contrasting reactions.

While Anna Rule (Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Virginia Beach,
VA; Tel: 804/874-1287) exposes the impracticalities and
inadequacies of compliance testing, Darrell R. Wilder
(Environmental Services Lab, Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, TN
37662-5054) sees compliance testing and waste minimization as
opportunities for self-directed efforts to eliminate sources of
pollution and reduce the burden of testing.

Writing in Water Environment & Technology [7-11, 31-34, 1995] Rule
points out that the minimum concentration at which a chemical's
presence can be determined by a specific method is an exceedingly
minute but imprecise quantity which has nevertheless become a
regulatory goal and performance standard. A method detection limit
(MDL) is the minimum concentration of a substance which can be
identified, measured, and reported with 99% confidence that its
concentration is greater than zero. The EPA bases MDL on the
standard deviation of a set of replicate determinations.

The EPA has set water quality criteria for some substances at or
below MDLs without considering the limits of analytical technology.
Compliance with permit limits set below MDLs or at zero is
problematic because measurement errors, variability, and
uncertainty. Measurements at ultradilute levels are consequently
anything but absolutely true and exact determinations.

Rule indicates the flaws in deriving a confidence interval from a
set of determinations and suggests that prediction intervals or
tolerance intervals are more appropriate for estimating the range
of future multiple measurements and the probability that a given
percentage of them attain a given MDL. Rule points out that it
introduces a bias to treat results at or below an MDL as zero or
nondetectable while accepting higher values as true and accurate.

"All measurements, at any level, include defined and unavoidable
imprecision. Analytical and sample variance, or relative standard
deviation of measurements (RSD) is not constant throughout the
concentration range but gradually increases as the results approach
the lower or upper end of the analytical range. . . . The practice
of eliminating low-level data by reporting 'less than' or 'zero' is
called left-censoring and is regarded as an unnecessary loss of
valuable information." While it is statistically valid to use low-
end data, this approach often conflicts with setting regulatory
limits.

Rule favors the calibration curve method as an alternative for
estimating measurement detection limits. This method finds
tolerance intervals for assessing future performance and uses them
to define uncertainty bands on the calibration curve. The analyst
may then compute and define minimum concentrations that have an
acceptable level of confidence with a predetermined RSD. The
calibration curve method is the basis of a proposal presented to
EPA by a Detection/Quantitation Workgroup representing the
regulated community. Other concepts of MDL may be appropriate, but
the problem is the validity of low-end results. Carefully developed
and documented protocols should allow a more effective validation
and define more appropriate uses although at a higher cost.

Working the higher end of compliance testing, Wilder accepts
compliance testing as a fact of life for environmental discharges
in the chemical industry. Now that the NPDES program has entered a
phase of diminishing returns, the EPA is encouraging a "front end"
approach to pollution control that encourages proactive waste
minimization and pollution prevention.

Government initiatives and voluntary programs have created
financial incentives for chemical companies to go beyond routine
compliance by developing environmental strategies that reflect
environmental responsibility. Writing in Analytical Chemistry [25-
2, 77-89, 1995] Wilder presents a review of some new measurement
technologies for preventing pollution and cutting waste.

Wilder considers technologies for measurement of wasteload
concentrations, flow measurements, monitoring specific waste
components, monitoring networks, process control of activated
sludge treatment systems, and measurement of air emissions. Wilder
believes that internal and self-directed efforts by chemical
companies in all these areas give analysts scope for ingenuity and
creativity in identifying and eliminating sources of toxic
contaminants. Successful results could reduce the burden of

Improved Gels for
Oil Field Brines

Gelled or crosslinked water-soluble polymers are used in enhanced
oil recovery and other oil field operations to change formation
permeability, enhancing the effectiveness of water flooding
operations. Generally, polymers along with an appropriate
crosslinking system are injected in an aqueous solution into the
formation and permeate into and gel in the regions of highest water
permeability. By using a produced brine as the aqueous solution
carrier for the polymers, operators can avoid the environmental
concerns as well as cost for disposing of a produced brine. It also
saves the cost associated with acquiring and pre-treating fresh
water for use as the aqueous solution.

Most produced brines are hard brines, defined as having a salinity
of greater than 2% total dissolved solids, basically inorganic
salts. Chromium(III) carboxylates such as chromium acetate are the
only known crosslinkers which can be used to produce stable gels in
produced brines for near-wellbore treatment. Although a
chromium(III) salt is not as toxic as a chromium(VI) salt, it is
still not desirable in the environment. Its use may require
additional costs to assure the integrity of the injection wells to
avoid contamination of ground water sources.

Ahmad Moradi-Araghi of Phillips Petroleum Co. (16 Phillips Bldg.,
Bartlesville, OK 74004; Tel: 918/661-6600) has found a more
environmentally suitable gelling composition that can form stable
gels in produced brines. It has the benefit that the gelling
composition does not crosslink too fast (i.e., gel times longer
than 2 hours) so that individual components of the composition can
be injected simultaneously into the wells. The composition consists
of a produced brine; a water-soluble polymer (i.e.,
polyacrylamide), a crosslinker (i.e., a complexed zirconium
compound), and optionally a complexing ligand (i.e., lactic acid).
The composition can be used for either in depth treatment of an oil
field or near-wellbore treatment such as water shutoff, gas
shutoff, and zone abandonment.

More specific information is included in U.S. Patent 5,478,802. The
patent says that it is desirable to delay the rate of gelation so
that the components of the composition can be injected at the same
time without plugging up the injection or producing wells.  A
produced brine having a salinity of from 4-25% generally produces
better results.

Suitable polymers are those which are capable of gelling in the
presence of polyvalent metal ion crosslinking agents. Polymers
capable of gelling in the presence of crosslinking agents within a
gelation pH range, include biopolysaccharides, cellulose ethers,
and acrylamide-based polymers. The preferred biopolysaccharides are
polysaccharide B-1459 and xanthan gums which are biopolysaccharides
produced by the action of Xanthomonas campestris bacteria.
Preferred cellulose ethers include carboxymethylhydroxyethyl
cellulose (CMHEC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Preferred
polymers which contain acrylamide as well as 0.5-5 mole % of
pendant carboxylate (acrylate) groups are the partially hydrolyzed
polyacrylamides possessing pendant carboxylate groups through which
crosslinking can take place.

The crosslinker is a metal compound selected from the group
consisting of a complexed zirconium compound, a complexed titanium
compound, and mixtures of these. These compounds are commercially
available.

A suitable complexing ligand to retard the rate of gelation may be
chosen from the group consisting of lactic acid, neutralized lactic
acid, citric acid, ammonium, potassium or sodium citrate, isocitric
acid, ammonium, potassium or sodium isocitrate, malic acid,
ammonium, potassium or sodium malate, tartaric acid, ammonium,
potassium or sodium tartrate, triethanolamine, malonic acid,
ammonium, potassium or sodium malonate, and mixtures of these. Due
to their ready availability and low cost, the presently preferred
complexing ligands are triethanolamine, citric acid, lactic acid,
tartaric acid and salts of these.

The composition of the invention can be prepared by mixing the
individual components together employing conventionally well-known
mixing means. The order of adding individual components does not
change the characteristics of the composition.

The concentration of crosslinker in the composition depends largely
on the concentration of polymer in the composition. Lower
concentrations of polymer require lower concentrations of
crosslinker. Further, it has been found that for a given
concentration of polymer, increasing the concentration of
crosslinker generally substantially increases the rate of gelation.
The concentration of crosslinker in the injected slug varies
generally over the broad range of 25-5,000 ppm, preferably over the
range of 100-2,000 ppm based on Zr or Ti concentration.

The concentration of the complexing ligand in the composition also
depends on the concentrations of the water-soluble polymer in the
composition and on the desired rate of gelation. Generally, the
faster the gelation rate, the lower concentration of the complexing
ligand is required. Generally, the concentration of the complexing
ligand varies broadly in the range of about 25-5,000 ppm,
preferably in the range of about 50-3,000 ppm, and most preferably
in the range of 100-2,000 ppm.

PDVSA Is Now a
Mature Corporation

Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA, Apartado 169, Caracas 1010-A,
Venezuela) recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. PDVSA has
moved from its initial role of being "a simple coordinator" of 14
subsidiaries to "a mature and powerful corporation, with clarity of
objectives, and holding a first class national and international
position," said PDVSA president Luis Giusti. "Today, PDVSA is a
strong and solvent corporation holding an excellent position on the
main world markets, with a modern production and refining
infrastructure and a first class technical team."

PDVSA has confirmed that the Orinoco Oil Belt contains reserves of
heavy and extra heavy crudes and bitumens estimated at
approximately 1.2 trillion barrels, of which some 270 billion
barrels are recoverable with the use of today's technology. Those
massive reserves of hard to market heavy crudes and bitumens in the
Belt have posed a major challenge for PDVSA. The corporation has
approached development in two ways: negotiating strategic
associations with foreign oil companies to exploit and upgrade the
recoverable resources and embarking on an ambitious project
converting bitumen into Orimulsion, a unique boiler fuel used in
plants that generate electricity.

Maraven, one of the PDVSA Group has worked out two major
development projects in partnership with several international
companies. Along with Conoco Inc. (P.O. Box 1267, Ponca City, OK
74602-1267; Tel: 405/767-3456), Maraven will produce approximately
120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy crude from the Belt.

That crude will be upgraded in Venezuela to a lighter synthetic
crude using Conoco's delayed coking technology. A similar
production and upgrading project involving Maraven, Total (Cedex
47, 92069 Paris la Defense, Paris, France), Itochu (1-3 Kita-
Kyutaromachi, Osaka OSK0541, Japan), and Marubeni Corp. (5-7
Honmachi, 2-Chome, Osaka OSK0541, Japan) are also ready to go
onstream.

Letters of intent already have been signed for a third development
project in the belt that will bring Corpoven, a member of the PDVSA
group, and ARCO International Oil and Gas Co. in a strategic
association to produce some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of medium
grade crudes, and a fourth project involving a partnership between
Lagoven, a member of the PDVSA Group, and Mobil Oil Corp. (3225
Gallows Rd., Fairfax, VA 22037; Tel: 703/846-3000) to produce
100,000 bpd from the eastern region of the Belt.

The corporation hopes those four projects will generate a combined
output of between 400,000-500,000 bpd of synthetic crude by the
turn of the century. Those joint venture deals follow a series of
operating agreements between PDVSA subsidiaries and several private
foreign companies for the reactivation of marginal or inactive oil
fields which now are producing an additional 58,00 bpd of crudes.
PDVSA expects to exceed 430,000 bpd by the year 2000.

PDVSA subsidiaries have made a series of operating agreements with
private foreign companies for the reactivation of marginal or
inactive oil fields which are now producing an additional 58,000
barrels per day of crudes. That figure is expected to exceed
430,000 bpd by the turn of the century.

PDVSA has begun an ambitious plan to manufacture and export
Orimulsion. Orimulsion exports have grown from about 1.7 million
metric tons in 1992 to approximately 2.43 million metric tons in
1994. The plan projects Orimulsion exports at approximately 20
million metric tons by the year 2000.  Bitumenes Orinoco, S.A.
(BITOR), the subsidiary of PDVSA responsible for the manufacture,
transport and marketing of Orimulsion, has already signed a supply
contract agreement with Canada's New Brunswick Power, which adapted
its Dalhousie power plant to burn Orimulsion fuel, and with Florida
Power & Light which will use Orimulsion in its Manatee, FL plant.

BITOR is negotiating with electric facilities in Europe and Asia.
BITOR has shipped significant test volumes of Orimulsion to
potential clients in Portugal, Italy and Germany. A supply contract
has been signed with SK-Power of Denmark for the purchase of up to
1.5 million metric tons a year of the product, for two years, which
began in 1995.

Suncor Scales
Up in Australia

In Australia, Suncor Inc. (P.O. Box 38, 112 4th Ave. SW, Calgary,
Albert, Canada; Tel: 403/269-8100) will scale up and apply Taciuk
processor technology. Taciuk processor technology was originally
developed by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology Research Authority
(AOSTRA), the functions of which are now part of the Alberta Dept.
of Energy (5th Floor, 801 6th Ave. SW, Calgary, Alberta T2P 3W2,
Canada; Tel: 403/297-3380). The Taciuk processor combines the
extraction, upgrading and energy-generating processes of
traditional oil sands/shales projects and requires less capital and
equipment.

"Suncor was the first in the world to pioneer the commercial
development of the oil sands," said Suncor president and CEO Rick
George. "We are uniquely positioned to apply our expertise in oil
sands development in other parts of the world."

Suncor has reached an agreement with two Australian companies,
Southern Pacific Petroleum NL (Lufthansa House, 143 MacQuarie St.,
Sidney, NSW 2000, Australia) and Central Pacific Minerals NL
(McFarlane House, 127 George St., Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia),
to begin development work to demonstrate the commercial viability
of producing oil from Australian oil shale using the Taciuk
process.

Suncor will invest $7 million to conduct preliminary engineering
and complete commercial negotiations to build a shale oil plant in
Gladstone, a port city on the east coast in Queensland, Australia.
The agreement covers the development of the Stuart oil shale
deposit which is estimated to contain the equivalent of three
billion barrels of shale oil.

Development work is expected to take six to nine months to
complete. After that the partners will decide whether to proceed
with the 4,500 barrel a day plant. The project is estimated to cost
about $200 million, of which Suncor would contribute up to an
additional $65 million over the next two years. At that point,
Suncor would earn a 50% interest in the project.

If the project is successful, Suncor and its partners have plans to
develop a second and third stage, which could ultimately result in
an 85,000 barrel a day commercial operation over a 10 year period.
In addition, Suncor has the right to acquire an option for $3.5
million to purchase a 22.4% interest in Southern Pacific Petroleum
and Central Pacific Minerals. This option can be exercised any time
up to six months after the shale oil plant begins operations.

George said the project fits strategically with Suncor's growth
plans. "Our core businesses continue as the foundation of our
growth," said George. "To create additional shareholder value, we
are pushing the boundaries of our existing businesses and looking
for new yet related energy opportunities." Suncor plans to
diversify in stages through a series of modest investments.

Suncor has plans to spend more than $1 billion over five years to
increase production at its Oil Sands and Resources groups. Suncor
plans to invest approximately $475 million on capital and
exploration programs in 1996, up about 20% from 1995. Of the $475
million, approximately $260 million will be directed to the oil
sands, $160 million will go to the conventional oil and gas
division and $55 million will be spent at Sunoco, Suncor's refining
and marketing group.

"The increased spending supports our plans to expand our
conventional exploration and production and oil sands operations,"
said Rick George, Suncor president and CEO. The Oil Sands Group
capital program includes projects to expand production, plan a new
mine site, reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and make other
environmental and sustaining capital investments.

At Resources Group, capital will be spent on increasing reserves
and production through exploration, development and acquisitions.
Suncor also plans to spend approximately $17 million on a project
to test a new technology at its Burnt Lake heavy oil property. In
its downstream operations, Suncor will increase spending to
approximately $55 million to improve environmental, energy and
operating efficiency at its refining and Sunoco retail operations.

ChevronMoves
Toward Its Goals

Chevron Corp. (P.O. Box 7753, San Francisco, CA 94120-7753; Tel:
415/894-4440) chairman Ken Derr told a meeting of financial
analysts that Chevron has made great strides in the second half of
1995 toward improving shareholder value and reducing the company's
already competitive cost structure. He noted that Chevron's stock
hit an all-time high during December 1995 and that Chevron has had
its most productive year of oil discoveries in 15 years, based on
the projected reserves from a number of key wells.

One promising area is a new discovery in the Congo, Moho Marine 1,
which is one of Chevron's largest discoveries in West Africa. The
field appears to be geologically similar to nearby N'Kossa. The
N'Kossa field is on track to begin production in mid-1996, with
peak production of 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected in late
1997. Chevron's share is 30%.

Several promising areas are in Northwest Australia, where Chevron
and partners have made major discoveries and added new production.
Last month, the Wanaea and Cossack fields began production and are
scheduled to reach design capacity of 115,000 bpd in the first
quarter. Huge gas discoveries at Chrysaor and Perseus were also
announced in the past year.

"One of Chevron's enduring strengths is our ability to find oil and
gas, and we are completing an exceptionally good year of new
discoveries," Derr said. "In addition to this, we expect to replace
more than 110% of our worldwide proved reserves when final 1995
figures are in."

Also in the exploration and production area, Chevron announced in
December 1995 a major alliance with Maraven of Venezuela to further
develop the huge Boscan oil field and supply heavy crude oil to
U.S. refineries (see article in foreign Industry News, this issue).

Several company businesses in December 1995 have announced
restructuring to reduce costs, improve efficiency and to meet
strategic intents, Derr noted, including:

Chevron Chemical Co., which announced a restructuring along
geographic lines, forming a new International Group as well as a
U.S. chemicals division. The action supports the chemical company's
strategic intent to improve competitive financial performance while
developing attractive opportunities for growth, Derr said. The
former Aromatics and Olefins divisions, both headquartered in
Houston, will be combined to form one U.S. Chemicals Div., to
remain in Houston.

A new international group, eventually to be based in San Ramon, CA,
will help Chevron focus specifically on growth markets in key
regions around the world.  Chevron Chemical's other major division,
the Oronite Additives Div., based in San Ramon, already operates
internationally and is unaffected by the reorganization.

U.S. products marketing announced a consolidation of regional
offices and support functions, reducing costs $8 million per year
and supporting greater customer focus. U.S. refining also has a new
management team charged with achieving incident free operation
while reducing costs. The business activities of Chevron
International Oil Co. are being reorganized, as announced early
this month. As part of the change, the company's international
lubricants business will be consolidated with the U.S. business
into a new Global Lubricants unit.

Another major step was taken by Caltex, Chevron's 50-50 joint
venture with Texaco, which is a major refiner/marketer in Asia.
Caltex recently announced the $2 billion sale of its 50% interest
in a refining company in Japan, where markets are mature, in order
to focus more on growth areas such as China and India. The action
supports the strategy of growing Caltex in attractive markets,
while achieving superior competitive financial performance.

Beta Well to Sell
Kazakstan Interest

The Board of Directors of Beta Well Service Inc. (Calgary, Alberta,
Canada; Tel: 403/290-0660) has approved a conditional agreement in
principle to sell its 50% interest in the Zhetybay-Quest
partnership, two well servicing rigs and related equipment, all of
which are located in Kazakstan, to a large oil and gas company.  It
is proposed that the transaction's effective date and closing date
will be March 31,1996. If the sale is completed, the consideration
would be approximately $12 million in cash 91 days after closing,
and deferred payments totaling $30 million contingent upon
Zhetybay-Quest's profitability.

A company spokesman said that if the transaction can be completed,
it would be a positive development for all interested parties.
"Beta would have the opportunity to realize a significant return on
its Zhetybay-Quest investment.  The financial strength of the
prospective new owner would assure its Kazak partner and the
government of Kazakstan that the Zhetybay field would be developed
on a timely basis."

Chevron, Maraven
Form Major Alliance

Chevron (6001 Bollinger Canyon Rd., San Ramon, CA 94583; Tel:
510/842-1000) and Maraven S.A. (Apartado Postal 829, Caracas,
Venezuela 1010-A;  Tel: 58/2 908 3096) have formed a multi-faceted
alliance which will further the development of the Boscan oil field
in Venezuela and provide for supplies of heavy crude oil to Chevron
in the U.S.

The alliance covers an initial period of 20 years with an optional
10 year extension. Chevron will operate Venezuela's Boscan heavy
oil field, and anticipates a $2 billion investment over a 20-30
year period.  Maraven will become Chevron's joint-venture partner
in a West Coast asphalt business, and will also supply crude for
Chevron's refinery at Pascagoula, MS, and for the company's asphalt
plants at Perth Amboy, NJ, Portland, OR, and Richmond Beach, WA.

For the Boscan Field, Chevron and Maraven have structured an
Operating Service Agreement to assure continued development of the
50-year-old Boscan field, discovered by Chevron in 1946.  "We plan
to increase production from 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 115,000
bpd during the next three years," said Richard Matzke, president of
Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., who signed the agreement.

Independent studies confirm the Boscan field contains 1.6 billion
barrels of proven reserves.  Chevron will be responsible for
operations and production, while Maraven will be responsible for
marketing. Through the new arrangement, Chevron becomes the first
international oil company since 1975 to be responsible for such a
high level of production in Venezuela.  "We're encouraged by
Maraven's demonstration of trust in our technical expertise,"
Matzke said. He noted that the work to be done, albeit challenging,
will result in major economic enhancements for the Venezuelan
economy.

"Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees, is an excellent
asphalt feedstock," explained Dave O'Reilly, president of Chevron
U.S.A. (CUSA) Products Co., who signed the downstream agreements.
"This new alliance provides an opportunity for Chevron and Maraven
to collaborate on both upstream and downstream ventures," O'Reilly
said.

Affiliates of Chevron and Maraven will also form a partnership to
acquire and process feedstock into asphalt and other products for
marketing in the Western U.S. The new joint venture, to be named
Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance, will have a processing and service
agreement with CUSA Products which will retain its West Coast
asphalt refineries and perform supply, processing and marketing
functions on behalf of the joint venture.  "This venture should
increase asphalt production and offer new marketing opportunities,"
said O'Reilly.

Occidental Expands
Ecuador Operations

Occidental Petroleum Corp. (10889 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA
90024-4201; Tel: 213/879-1700) and Canadian Occidental Petroleum
Ltd. have reached an agreement with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian
state oil company, to increase exploration and development
activities on Block 15 in the prolific Oriente Basin in eastern
Ecuador.

The agreement calls for Occidental as operator to conduct an
exploration program in the 97% of the block that has yet to be
explored.  In exchange, Occidental receives improved contract terms
regarding new discoveries, including a minimum extension of seven
years to develop new discoveries.

Occidental acquired the 494,000-acre block in 1985 under a risk-
service contract with Petroecuador. To date, six fields have been
discovered, and four of those have been developed and are producing
approximately 24,000 barrels of oil per day.  The 20-year
exploitation period under the contract began in 1992. Occidental
has an 85% interest in the block with Canadian Occidental holding
the remaining 15%.

Pennzoil in China
Joint Venture

Pennzoil Products Co. (Pennzoil Place, P.O. Box 2967, Houston, TX
77262-8200; Tel: 713/546-6100) has acquired a 50% equity share in
a new lubricant manufacturing and marketing joint venture between
Pennzoil and Lithcon Petroleum Inc. in Tianjin, China.

William E. Welcher, group VP, products marketing, said that
Pennzoil and Lithcon have purchased land and an existing, new
building in Tianjin which will be utilized for a lubricating oil
blending plant and a sales and marketing office complex. "The
existing facility is strategically located close to one of China's
largest ports in the Tianjin Economic Technological Development
Area," said Welcher.  "It is also located in the Bohai Bay area,
China's second largest economic zone."

Welcher said that owing to Bohai Bay's natural and labor resources,
large market and technology, this area is expected to become the
nucleus of the northeast Asia's economic belt which spans north and
north-east China, South Korea, Mongolia, Siberia and the Far East.
The total lubricants requirement within the five provinces located
around Tianjin together with the municipalities of Beijing and
Tianjin is approximately one-third of China's total lubricant
demand.

Making Well Info
More Accessible

Obtaining data for an oil or gas producing property is a time
consuming and difficult task, limiting the producer's effectiveness
to make sound business and engineering decisions. The data are
located in a variety of places, some of which are inaccessible to
the average user. Independent producers would like more effective
access to this crucial information to expand their business
options. Major oil companies with properties in which production is
no longer justified would like more effective access to facilitate
the sale of any properties that independents might see as viable.
Government agencies would like to see more effective access for the
independents to avoid the abandonment of wells that might be
productive.

Sam Coleman (Tel: 510/422-4323) and Jeff Wagoner (Tel: 510/422-
1374) of Lawrence Livermore National Lab (Univ. of California, P.O.
Box 808, L-156, Livermore, CA 94551) are developing a database of
existing oil field data for California and Texas. These states,
like many other states, provide public access to oil and gas
production data, and other types of well information. Much of the
data is centrally located. However, the data are in a format that
is difficult to search and retrieve with access mechanisms which
are ineffective, tedious, and expensive to maintain.

The Oil and Gas Data Infrastructure Project is designing,
implementing, and integrating inexpensive, standards-based,
mechanisms for online access to data from Texas, California, and
other states. The project will combine database, Internet, and
World Wide Web technology to make existing Oil and Gas data readily
available for online analysis.

Cost-effective access will be available through the existing
Internet infrastructure using de facto Internet tools. Data will be
displayed on the user's personal computer or downloaded for
analysis by a variety of existing commercial applications. The
project will deliver a demonstration system that will serve as a
prototype for use by government agencies and private corporations.
It is anticipated that cost effective analysis of data will
facilitate the transfer of petroleum leases to independent
producers, slow the abandonment of wells, enhance the production of
existing fields, and increase the efficiency of drilling
activities.

The California Div. of Oil and Gas and Geothermal Resources and the
Texas Railroad Commission maintain a great deal of information on
each well. This includes applications to do work, permits issued,
drilling and exploration histories and maps.

The information has been available to the public and industry, but

Short Radius-Curved
Borehole Apparatus

W. James Hughes, James W. McCabe, and Owen L. Marks, Jr. of
Maverick Tool Co. (211 Beeline Dr., Bensenville, IL 60106. Tel:
708/860-5632) have developed a new method and apparatus to drill a
short radius curved boreholes portion of a horizontal or
directional well. This technique can achieve a radius of curvature
of less than 20 ft.

A tight radius of curvature is rotary drilled by use of flexible
composite drilling pipe or other common flexible pipe which
terminate within an eccentric collar on the final drill string
section. The eccentric collar is equipped with a retractable and
grooved compression pad which expands outwardly to hold the
eccentric collar (which is also grooved on its opposite side)
against the side of the well bore to prevent the eccentric collar
from rotating during the rotary drilling process. The final drill
string section connects to a lower drill bit collar and rotary
drill bit through a driving ball and socket connection. The
eccentric collar on the final drill string section that engages the
well bore forces the deflection of the drill bit about the ball and
socket connection and holds this orientation as the rotating drill
proceeds forward.

The short radius required for lateral or horizontal drilling has
been a difficult drilling process to control. In the past, a
whipstock was employed to drill short radius horizontal holes below
a vertical cased well bore. This technique limits the smallest
curvature radius for surface drilling to 19 feet which is 3 of
deflection per foot over 30 ft. of linear drilling to produce a
horizontal drainhole at depths greater than 2,000 ft.

Although others have achieved some degree of success in drilling a
tight radius or curvature, Maverick's new patented (U.S. 5,467,834)
apparatus addresses the problems of the inconsistent radius of
curvature, the weakness of ball/pin flexible joint which could fail
under normal operating conditions, and the difficulty in
maintaining the desired orientation of deflection. It overcomes the
inability to accurately determine the direction and correct for
errors and the multiple problems caused by constant engagement of
spring-loaded blades ranging from misorientation to sticking in the
hole.

Energy BioSystems
Better Biocatalyst

Energy BioSystems Corp. (4200 Research Forest Dr., The Woodlands,
TX 77381; Tel: 713/364-6100, Fax: 713/364-6110) has made a major
advance in the performance of the biocatalyst which drives the
company's proprietary biocatalytic desulfurization (BDS) system.
Application of recent discoveries has lead to a six- to eightfold
increase in the specific activity of intermediate reactions
critical to BDS economics.

"In the last few months we have applied the discoveries reported in
September," said Dr. Daniel J. Monticello, VP of R&D at Energy
Biosystems. "The resulting improvement exceeds our expectation of
a three- to fivefold increase. We are now significantly closer to
the performance level needed for commercialization of BDS, but
additional development is required on a dinal reaction to produce
the prototype biocatalyst necessary for pilot plant demonstration
runs," he continued. Further improvements are expected in early
1996 which should lead to the biocatalyst performance required for
commercial demonstration of BDS technology.

Energy BioSystems announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office has issued two new process patents to the company. "We
continue to improve the process design of BDS as well as the
biocatalyst," commented Dr. Monticello, "and we continue to pursue
strong patent protection for these improvements in order to enhance
our competitive position as we move toward the commercialization of
BDS."

The first patent (U.S. 5,472,875) claims a new reactor design
involving the introduction of air or oxygen-enriched gas into the
oil prior to treatment with the biocatalyst. The second patent
(U.S. 5,468,626) claims a method by which a biosorption agent
preferentially adsorbs sulfur-containing compounds from petroleum.
Such a process design could reduce the size of the bioreactor by
concentrating on those compounds requiring desulfurization, thus
reducing capital equipment cost.

Exxon Upgrades
Steam Cracker Tars

Researchers at Exxon Corp. (1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
NY 10020) have discovered a process for the production of gaseous
mono- and di-olefins, particularly ethylene, propylene and
butadiene. The advantage of the process is that it prevents or
mitigates reactions of asphaltene precursors to form asphaltenes.

The patented process (U.S. 5,443,715) involves first introducing a
hydrocarbon feedstock stream into a high temperature thermal
cracking zone to produce a high temperature cracked product stream.
The cracked product stream is quenched to stop the cracking
reactions. At least one HDD (hydrogen donor diluent) such as
hydrotreated steam cracked tar oils is injected into the cracked
product stream at or downstream of the point at which the reaction
is quenched, so as to prevent thermal degradation reactions of the
steam cracked liquids.

Normally gaseous olefins are recovered from the cracked product
stream, and a liquid product stream is recovered which contains a
diminished asphaltene content. In this manner, the process upgrades
the tars that are formed during the production of gaseous olefins.
The inventors are Dane C. Grenoble, Roy T. Halle, Martin L.
Gorbaty, and Harold W. Helmke.

Solvent, Steam
Soak Promising

Researchers at Maraven (Apdo. 829, Caracas 1010-A, Venezuela) have
evaluated using various additives to enhance oil recovery and
improve the economics of steam soak projects. Initial results are
encouraging. Solvent injection with steam resulted in initial oil
rates 50% higher than steam alone. The steam soak process can be
efficient and economical, but in western Venezuela its
effectiveness is linked to formation compaction, the main
production mechanism. To optimize the effects of the steam soak
process, various additives were tested to improve the cycle
behavior.

The additives used in the tests included surfactants to increase
vertical steam distribution and improve the flow of the heated oil,
solvents to increase oil mobility and steam stimulation followed by
a slug of natural gas to increase the heated area and reactivate
the solution gas drive mechanism.

It was concluded that steam soak with solvent coinjection was the
most feasible approach, since solvent additives are abundant and
cost less than the other additives used in this study. Further
observation and evaluation of this approach was recommended. The
results were first presented at the Unitar International Conference
on Heavy Crude and Tar Sands held in Houston, TX.
