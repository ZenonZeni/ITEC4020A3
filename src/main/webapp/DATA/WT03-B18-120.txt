<h1><center>Workspace 4.0 - The Price is Right - FREE</center></h1>

<p>Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc., the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace has made the # 1 selling PC-based simulation and off-line programming package more affordable by making it possible to acquire it for free.
We work closely with robot integrators on a daily basis and recognize the barriers. By joining our Preferred Partners program, we can not only supply them with the system for free, but increase their
business through our lead referral program. This program has proven to be very successful for matching integration of robot cells and the use of Workspace for our customers.
</p>
<p>The program is based on the initial rental of Workspace. The Systems Integrator rents a minimum of one seat of Workspace. The base rental fee is $2100 per month with additional robot models and languages extra. They then are fully trained at the RWT-Workspace school in Fort Myers, FL and certified in the use of Workspace.</p>
<p>Once they are certified, they are eligible to rent additional Workspace systems to their customers. This benefits the S.I. in having a system on-site for post work and the customer a system for in-house use.</p> 
<p>The rental fee to the customer is billed monthly by RWT directly to eliminate hassles for the Preferred Partner. RWT then credits the Preferred Partner's monthly bill for 20% of the rental fee, averaging  $420 per month to the S.I..
It only takes 5 systems placed at customer sites to then have the use of one Workspace system for FREE each month. After 5 systems, the Preferred Partner can choose to add additional Workspace seats to their own facility or receive a monthly check for the residual income from the rentals of systems over 5.
</p><p>Preferred Partners can make additional monthly income from this program, but can then increase billable time on their own Workspace as more of their customers are using the system.</p>
<p>To go along with the Preferred Partner program is the lead referral program. A program that provides full, systems integration leads to the Preferred Partners that are using Workspace.</p>
<p>We have a number of calls each week from prospective robotics customers who are looking for someone to design, implement and program their specific application. Since we are not in the business of systems integration, we pass these on to the specialists, our Preferred Partners.</p>
<p>To find out how you can join the Preferred Partners program, contact your RWT Account Manager at 941-466-0488.
