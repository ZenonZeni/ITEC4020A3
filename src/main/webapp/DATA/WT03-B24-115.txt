<TITLE>Pat Farrell's Pointer to information about NT and the Internet</TITLE>

<body>
Microsoft's WindowsNT operating has the potential to be a great Internet host.
But Microsoft is not very facile with Internet standards, and
most Internet "experts" have a serious Unix-bias.
<p>
This is a list of helpful information for making a Windows NT computer
be a full member of the Internet community.
<ul>
<li>Read the "site description" at <a href="http://www.somar.com">Somar
software for info on how to Gateway to the Internet with NT</a>
<li><a href="http://www.somar.com/security.htm">NT security background</a>
<li>John Piraino's guide for 
<a href="http://www.execpc.com/~jpiraino/ppp.html">Connecting NT Workstations
to the 'net using PPP</a>
<li>Software.com has a lot of NT software, including a
<a href="http://www.software.com/">Free BIND (DNS daemon) for NT</a>
<li>An article about enabling NT's 
<a href="http://w3.melig.co.il/Vadim/routing.htm">RAS tcp/ip routing</a>
It tells you about regedt32 entries that you have to create.
<li>Here is some more information:
<blockquote>
After you configure your registry to enable packets from other sources 
and turn on IP routing, you must do 3 other things
<ol>
<li>  Partician your net into at least 2 subnets.  You can do this from 
the TCP/IP configuration under the networks control panel.  I'm using the 
subnet mask 255.255.255.128  Your RAS IP address must fall into a 
different subnet than your server's IP or workstations.
<p>
RAS IP         152.160.184.254 (upper subnet *.*.*.128-255)<br>
Server IP      152.160.184.100 (lower subnet *.*.*.0-127)<br>
Workstation IP 152.160.184.10  (lower subnet *.*.*.0-127)<br>
<p>
<li>  Add static routes to your routing table for each workstation.  Go to 
DOS prompt on the server and type route add (workstation IP) (server IP)
<p>
You now should be able to ping your server with RAS running, and IP 
addresses outside your net.

3.<li> Set the DNS entry on your workstations to the DNS address of your 
ISP. 
</ol>
I'm putting up a complete and detailed instructions on my Web page
<a href="http://www.owenrudy.com/"> www.owenrudy.com</a>, should be up in next couple of days.....
If you have any other questions email me at ocreger@ic.net
</blockquote>
<li>and still more:
<blockquote>
Next thing is to make sure, that the IP-Addres you use 
for RemoteAccess is always the same 
(you'll need it to specify the routings)
<p>
At last you must tell all your Clients to use the NT-Machine as deault gateway and enter 
persistent routes on your NT-Machine for each Client.
<p>
Example: let's say your RAS-IP-Address is 192.0.1.1 
and the LAN-IP-Address of your Gateway is 
192.0.2.1, your Clients have Addresses 192.0.2.2 etc.
<p>
Enter the following Line for each Client:
<p>
route -p 192.0.2.2 192.0.2.1
<br>
(don't forget the -p or you'll have to do it again after your next reboot)
<p>
</blockquote>
<li>and this...
<blockquote>
And acutally your RAS connection will deliver you TWO IP addresses,
one on the client and one on the server. My NT server has IP address
A1 on the NIC with gateway address G1. The RAS server give the clients
address C1, but it also keeps an address C2 for the RAS server. On the
client side I'm set up with Nic address A2, gateway empty (as to be
filled by the RAS connection).

I can set up a static route with the ROUTE command. I can route back
from the server by entering C1 as destination address, and C2 as the
gateway address. That way, NT routes all packets it can not address on
the local subnet mask to G1 except packets to C1. Those go via C2 to
C1. Basically you tell NT to use a different gateway address for a
certain IP. This gateway address over RAS seems to be the second RAS
ip address (the one that the RAS server keeps) and not the RAS client
address. Means it seems to use C2 rather than C1.
<p>
I'm not all the way there, but I'm pretty darn close to get RAS full
routing to work.
<p>
Hier my IP addresses:<br>
NT server 1.1.1.10
<p>
Gateway to the Internet on this LAN (ISDN via Pipeline 50) 1.1.1.1<br>
RAS IPs 1.1.1.20-1.1.1.22 (Range set in RAS setup)<br>
NT client (on a different LAN) 1.1.2.10<BR>
NT client demands 1.1.1.22 as it's RAS IP address.
<p>

<pre>
gateway--------LAN-NT Server-RAS-----------RAS-NT server-LAN<br>
1.1.1.1       1.1.1.10       1.1.1.20          1.1.1.22      1.1.2.10
</pre>
<p>


As I said, I'm almost there. If anyone has been there yet, please drop
me a note.
