Starting and Stopping Your Server
<P>
This chapter contains basic instructions
for starting and stopping your server.
It also describes the first tasks you will
probably want to perform after installation.

<H2><A NAME="HDRSTRSTO" HREF="#PToC_40">Starting the server</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes how to start and stop your server
after you have finished installing it.
If you think the server is running but you do not see the window
for it on your OS/2 Desktop, press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>
to see the list of active OS/2 programs.
If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double click
the entry to bring the server's window into view.
<P>
If you are running a non-secure server,
you will see the message
<TT>Security not available. <VAR>filename</VAR>.dll did not load</TT>.
This message lets you know that you are not running the Internet Connection Secure Server.
You do not need to do anything in response to the message.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_41" HREF="#PToC_41">Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder</A></H3>
<P>
If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,
the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.
Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.
If you rebooted your system after installing the server,
the server should be running now.
<P>
When you start the server automatically,
it uses the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_42" HREF="#PToC_42">Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon</A></H3>
<P>
The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Secure Server
folder on your OS/2 Desktop.
Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Secure Server.
To start the server, double click the icon.
<P>
The server starts with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_43" HREF="#PToC_43">Starting from the command prompt</A></H3>
<P>
You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>httpd</B>
</PRE>
<P>
This starts the server with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
The httpd command also accepts various options for changing
configuration settings at run time.
For details on the httpd command options,
see <A HREF="icswg015.html#HDRHTTPD">"httpd command"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_44" HREF="#PToC_44">Starting multiple instances of the server</A></H3>
<P>
You can start multiple instances of the server,
but each instance must listen on a separate port.
All instances, other than the first, can be started
by entering the following command from a command prompt:
<P>
<B>httpd -r <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR></B>
<P>
where <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR> is a configuration file that
specifies the individual port.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_45" HREF="#PToC_45">Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window</A></H3>
<P>
You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Secure Server window
by selecting <B>Restart</B>
from the <B>Server</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
The server reloads the configuration settings from
the configuration file it was originally started with.
<P>
Most changes you have made to the configuration file
will be used by the server after it restarts.
However, if you changed a port setting or security settings, you need
to stop your server and start it again for those changes to take effect.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_46" HREF="#PToC_46">Restarting from the Configuration and Administration Forms</A></H3>
<P>
When using the Configuration and Administration Forms, you are sometimes
given the option of restarting the server after you apply changes.
See <A HREF="icswg003.html#HDRUSING">"Using the Configuration and Administration forms"</A> for more information.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_47" HREF="#PToC_47">Stopping the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.
Do any of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and double click
the small icon in the top left corner.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and select <B>Exit</B> from the
<B>Server</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and press <B>F3</B>.
<P><LI>Press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>.
With the right mouse button click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Secure Server.
Click <B>Close</B>.
