<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>Censored!!!!
<LI>I hve no problems with sex on the internet, you just have to watrch out for the childre with access to the internet
<LI>I am always surpised but what I accidentally find during seemingly innocent searches
<LI>If you dont like it go away
<LI>it a leaening tool                         
<LI>It's fat!
<LI>i like it, it an alternative to videos,mags, etc.......
<LI>Interesting.  It's a matter of personal choice.  If you dont want it, it doesn't appear.  If you have children, you should be monitering them as would would in all things.  
<LI>It is fun to play on the net with sex, when you are home by yourself.
<LI>No Big Deal
<LI>It's fun when I'm not gettin any elsewhere
<LI>Lots of fun
<LI>Not as hard as I thought it would be
<LI>Keep the Jesus freaks, and liberals off of the net.  No new censorship!
<LI>i think it's the greatest thing that i've found
<LI>Efforts to regulate content on the internet should not be discussed during an election year.
<LI>grooovey
<LI>It is good!
<LI>I luv it
<LI>boring
<LI>I think pornography in general is rather stupid, but what other people want to do is none of my buisiness.
<LI>I think it promotes curiosity and misleads people into fantasies that hurts most partners
<LI>I've only just begun to explore
<LI>It's very overrated...
<LI>I have no problem with it, and in fact I think it's funny
<LI>Its a good place to sexually fantasize
<LI>I really can't find any, I guess I just stupid
<LI>HAVE NOT SEEN TOO MUCH OF IT (YET)
<LI>I think in recent times it has been maturing into a type of standard practice of do's and don'ts by the net self regulating. Not too much fringe stuff anymore... good to see government is not required to mediate this.
<LI>The Net is just like the real world, you'll find anything you look for.
<LI>It is a good sourse for information and natural interest
<LI>its fun when you cum...uuhhhhuhhuhh..hhuhh..
<LI>I think this is the last compleat place of freedom.  Human beings should be able to look inside human nature and be aware how sexually oriented our society is.  Other characteristics come up on the internet and those should be the moral thermometer to all
<LI>I like it a lot.  That is the main reason I surf.
<LI>Where?
<LI>When I was with America Online, I really enjoyed it.  So did others.  Now that I am on the net, I have been working solo.  I have yet to communicate with others on the subject.  I like all the access of information though.
<LI>not so bad
<LI>I love it.
<LI>It's great fun and better than going out to the bars!!!!
<LI>great safe outlet for fun and communication
<LI>Current situation is about right.  Censorship is too close to book-burning for my liking
<LI>I'd love to get involved.
<LI>I wish it would be more accesabile and I hate these site that you wait 10 min to get in then find it charges for there service
<LI>i like it alot
<LI>leave it alone. it's parents responsibility to take care of their own children. 
<LI>it`s good
<LI>very interesting,have found a lot of information on subject I am interested in.
<LI>yeap
<LI>I think that it's all a matter of self regulation.  If you don't like it, don't visit the damn site!
<LI>An incredibly tempting, and therefore, dangerous source of sexual stimulation.  I say dangerous because people are often very dull until something stimulates their mind and body.  Once their mind becomes engaged with something that thing (depending on the amount of stimulation and the enjoyment derived fom it) can lead to acts that are dangerous to yourself and others depending on your level of self-control (everyone has a limit), the influence the stimulation has upon you and the opportunities present
d.  Let's face it, sex is an incredibly strong motivator.  
<LI>Very interisting, but keeping in mind it is user who accesses to this kind of information and therefore maybe offended.
<LI>Much to be discussed, one thing is sure, many people view sex on the internet as a form of entertainment thus never going down the wrong path, and others use it as a tool to reap havock among the innocent. We can't deny the fact that crimminals are on the Net.
<LI>Terrific - but it's difficult to manuver th mouse during orgasms
<LI>US will have trouble enforcing their prudish attittude to WW
<LI>Freedom of choice should be allowed
<LI>Not of great interest
<LI>Rather than trying to change the net (an infeasible task), someone should create a "sanitized" environment, which of course would not have many of the nets benefits, but would be safe for kids. People who subscribe to Boy's Life don't get Playboy.  Unfortunately, they seem to want to change the existing net to be that sanitized environment, and the net is not amenable to that sort of control.

<LI>Porn delivered to your home, without even a brown paper wrapper. It's great!
<LI>Not enough reality - all fantasy
<LI>i think its over rated, its more masturbation materials
<LI>From what I have observed, the deviant nature of sex is not somthing that HAPPENS to be on the net, it is on the net, because people WANT it to be there.  The fact is that people are SICK indviduals underneath all of the business suits and dresses, and th
<LI>Everyone has curiosity. If parents don't want their children looking at pornographic stuff, MONITOR THEM! That's what parents are SUPPOSED to do!!
<LI>Interesting
<LI>I feel It should be allowed
<LI>I think that if people want to see sexually explicit material they should be allowed access to it.
<LI>Sex belongs in the bedroom between married couples only.
<LI>if you're responsible and mature enough, it's okay...you really have look for it. it seems ironic that people want to censor the internet but won't educate themselves or other about the responsibilty of sex/sexuality (ie:aids/std/pregnancy/sociological as
<LI>haven't been able to find any other than soft sex, playboy, hustler,etc.
<LI>It's there if you get bored but nothing to get all worked up about
<LI>It's a new way to construct sexuality, and it looks like it will extend a sort of benign experimentation.  I have not yet successfully met people from the net for sex (well, one who did show up was so pathetic that I never introduced myself, and another w
<LI>go on, girl!
<LI>I just started using the internet,and was surprised about the amount of material that can be obtained through the www.I am not a computer wiz, but in just five minutes using netscape I figured out how to access anything. I believe the ease of transmission to unsupervised persons (under 18) is not good for society as a whole. Curious junior high boys are probaly acessing stuff that otherwise would be difficult to obtain. I think the internet is an amazing thing, and I do not know how it could be regulat
d (or even should be by the gov.)
<LI>No opoin at the time
<LI>Let the net open, it is everybody freedom to decide what they want to see or read.  The responsibility should remain on people themself and nobody else should be allow to decide what other adult should see or read on the net.  I really do not like somebody playing God and decide for me. Thanks.
<LI>Great!
<LI>I think it's great.You can learn so much from it.
<LI>more especially gay
<LI>WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! 
<LI>sex is what one person thinks not society as a whole
<LI>It should be available if someone wants to access it.  "Big Brother" should ONLY be interested in crime against others (theft, fraud, etc...)
<LI>Noy bad!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>more,more,more...
<LI>there's none. there should be lot (real life ,uh).
<LI>It's a good thing,more people should try it.
<LI>A valuable service for those that wish to use it. A form of freedom that needs to be protected at all costs.
<LI>Want to explore more. This is a good private place to seek "taboo" information.
<LI>It's terrible! One would expect a higher standard of those technically capable of using the Internet.
<LI>there should be more
<LI>DON'T LET THE GOVERNMENT STEP IN ON THIS ONE, LIKE THEY HAVE IN OTHER ISSUES. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE!!
<LI>i'm a little annoyed, cause i keep hearing about all the interactive sites on the net, but i can't find any.  drat drat and damn.
<LI>Like 'em both  =)
<LI>Cool
<LI>Great
<LI>Too many sex sites on the net are commercialized.
<LI>its good
<LI>We need more and it stay more open
<LI>Popular media has blown this way out of proportion.  I have seen very little of it, but I specifically avoid it.  Sex is a beutiful thing but should only be had between a man and women who are married.
<LI>i like it
<LI>It's a nice way to kill a few hours
<LI>It provides harmless entertainment.
<LI>Sex for adults is ok for the net
<LI>i wish i could find it easier
<LI>There does need to be some type of "Over 18 Only" system
<LI>In all countries, sex is not to show in public; so there are always hidden place for them everywhere.
<LI>dude, it rocks!!:>
<LI>It's out there, but the truly "hard core" is hard to find.  The govt. should not regulate the net content. But there should be some measure to verify age, etc.
<LI>Mostly what I have seen is text.  i have no interst in paying for the pictures.  It is frightfully easy to find, and the more popular, crowded places seem to be the most blatantly depraved.  I thought that I had depraved instincts-I am attracted to younger girls.  (Fantasy only.)  Some of the shit I have seen here has really disgusted me.  I explore it in part because of my own depraved sexual instincts, and in part because of an intellectual curiosity in the depths of human depravity.  Although there 
s little here that I could not find somewhere else, I would have had to look a lot harded.  Like most other kinds of shit in the internet, there is little porn. that is remarkable in and of itself.  What is remarkable is the ease of access and the realtive privacy it offers.  (I am the exception.  I use a public, college terminal, having no computer of my own.)  This makes the ultra-depraved come more out into the open.  While it is valuable to know just how low we humans can go, it is also scary, and I wo
der if this will have the same effect on rapes that other kinds of porn. have.  (Encouragement.)  THis is mostly what concerns me.  The lowest, most depraved in our society now have an outlet.  They can grow in number, exchange ideas, and appeal to people with latent tendencies that have simply never come to fruition.  I think that this survey is a valuable tool for understanding this depravity,  If you are able, please send me a brief summary of the results.  (The long version would probably crowd out my 
-mail account.  I have seen survey results before, and they are many thousands of pages or reports.)  My e-mail adress is sk3698@cnsunix.albany.edu
<LI>it is pretty cool but I wish there was more nuidity!
<LI>Make it easier to find it through a net search.
<LI>advocating government regualtion could be understood of abdication personal moral responsibility
<LI>not so bad
<LI>There is a wide range of experiences to be had, and the openess is refreshing.
<LI>I think the people should leave sex alone - do there own thing.
<LI>I have learned MANY NEW SEX TRICKS from communcating on the internet.
<LI>I love it....
<LI>The internet is an exciting new way to exchange all kinds of information and sex is one of the most natural things on earth.
<LI>It needs more sexy pictures of women to download for free
<LI>ok if you don't let it go to your head.
<LI>Internet provides a very informative and valuable source of information
<LI>I love the Internet and Sex!  The day the Government starts to regulate the morality of everyones sex life is the day when we have lost all the freedoms granted to us by God.
<LI>Never have done it, but it can help in my relationship by giving me some insight on how to make my sex life more interesting.
<LI>Good!
<LI>Hold on while I say my alms... eh-hem.  Sex is what it is and the internet is,well an open forum.  People that are offended that sexual material exists on the net should go back to Calvin.  Parents that are worried about their kids should learn about the off switch.
<LI>I dont think there is anything wrong with sex on the internet as it is largely annonomys and is victimless if used and viewed in a responsible way.
<LI>Anonymous place to safely express and explore feelings and desires.
<LI>I think the inet is a great medium for anything sexual and should be encouraged and continued as long as people are not threatened and lines between free speach and blatant ignorance are not crossed.
<LI>It's wonderful, except for Child Pornography & Beastiality!
<LI>it really needs to be expanded to all aspects of sexuality.
<LI>I think there should be more of it.
<LI>I think that the sexual information on the internet is a great resource, and it has improved my sexual performance.
<LI>It should be protected under the constitution like everything else
<LI>like any other media, books, TV, magazines. It's there if you want it.
<LI>This is the information super highway, and sex is a part of our world.  Therefore it should be allowed on the net.
<LI>ITs fun
<LI>Hard core literature; lot of hype.
<LI>I do not know yet
<LI>It it not the government's place to monitor sex on the Internet.  The role should be performed by the parents of the minors.  If the parents don't have the time or care enough to watch their children, that's too damn bad for them.  Their irresponsibility shouldn't effect everyone else's freedom of speech and expression.  My concern is that the government will attempt to regulate the internet.  With governental intervention, the internet will lose its role as a means to express all ideas (not just sexua
).
<LI>Not really shocking...it doesn't bother me
<LI>I like it 
<LI>to each his own
<LI>may be interesting
<LI>great fun and mind expanding
<LI>I'm a newcomer to the Net. I have had no experiences.  Will write more later or as I get more familiar with the contents.  Thanks for your putting this forum on the Net and for giving me the opportunity to participate.
<LI>I Don't know that much about sex on the Inernet. 
<LI>I think that this is largely just another distraction from the real issues challenging American society and our polity: it's much easier to scapegoat "bogeymen" under our figurative beds than it is to deal with the problems of race/income disparity/employment/belief/community which are tearing this culture apart.
<LI>In this age of AIDS, safe sex is the only safe option.  There is no safer sex than Net sex.
<LI>should be easier to locate without too many advertisements
<LI>No one should interfere with what is distributed on the Internet.
<LI>sex is nothing to be ashamed of ...most people like it...what is wrong with lokking at it/ thinking about it
<LI>I do not feel that it should be government regulated. 
<LI>I think there needs to be more sex stuff on the net.  After a hard day at school, you need a break and some entertainment.  There are no government regulations on movies or magazines after all.
<LI>Educational&Entertaining
<LI>We as mature adults should have the right to veiw not the goverments they have enough to do with out butting into our private lives
<LI>it's good, every one can find wand and don't be bad with the other people.
<LI>This is the first survey I've seen dealing with sex on the net, It is great that someone actualy cares about the internet and the people on it to ask there opinions, unlike the US goverment.
<LI>I'm a sixteen year old bi girl and have been sexually active since I was twelve for. for the past year I have been accessing sex pages on the Net. I think its great there is so much sex info on the net; because of what I've read I will no longer fuck with
<LI>Very hard to access and restricted.
<LI>I think it's great that people of all ages can explore thier sexuality on the net and my parents encourage my exploration 
<LI>Sex is great, and the Internet is great!!!
<LI>Its Great!!!!
<LI>It's fairly difficult to find, takes a lot of time, and just is a cool way to meet people, tell very personal info to, and remain annonymous!  Thats pretty heavy, if you think about it.
<LI>Interesting content.
<LI>Sex, and related items, on the Interent give people a place to release their sexual anxieties without stooping to a "low" means of doing it.
<LI>It should be clearly publicised where sexually explicit material is, so that those who prefer to avoid it don't bump into it, and those who want it can find it easily.
<LI>Should be available to those who enjoy it
<LI>good
<LI>It is available just like anything else on the net is, and it should be that way.  Otherwise it could be called discrimination, or censorship.
<LI>It was bound to happen.
<LI>Open discussions allow society to mature in the area of sexuality and male/female relationships.
<LI>Open discussions allow society to mature in the area of sexuality and male/female relationships.
<LI>I feel it is up to the individual but that parents should be held responsible for their childrens conduct when using the net
<LI>Broadens ones horizons. Offers experimental opportunities.
<LI>I love sex I have it all of the time....
<LI>It's an escape at times when you need to escape.
<LI>thanks for giving me opportunity!
<LI>Most sexual content seems to be in Newsgroups, I Think its great for adults, but sexual newsgroups should require a password, given to adults only.
<LI>sexual content on the internet is fine.  its up to the parents to censor their children.  and if you're a 'prude' don't enter the site if you don't wanna see it!
<LI>Keep it up..... PLEASE
<LI>nothing to say
<LI>I think people hear about sex on the net, call in to see if it's true and then get added to the lists of data collectors
<LI>like anything on the internet, it's too damn hard to find what you are looking for!
<LI>The internet is providing a medium for exploring, discussing, and exposing sexual issues that has for too long been hidden and ignored. Plainly, the use of contemporary methods (i.e. TV, radio etc) have not allowed interaction in a way that the internet has and this has meant, at least in my experience, in a more useful and responsive medium for discussion and information on a multilateral level - this is truely wonderful. We all must learn to accept that knowledge is for everyone who wants it.
<LI>Haven't seen enough to answer.
<LI>I LOVE IT
<LI>As a net veteran of some 15 years, people are going to bring their excess baggage with them!
<LI>not enough interaction
<LI>I like
<LI>I like it and think there is nothing wrong with it.
<LI>I thinl they go together great
<LI>EXTREMELY COOL
<LI>where is is?
<LI>if people want to see it they should be allowed to see it.  it's a buyers market in a way.
<LI>Sex sells.  PERIOD.  So, if it attracts people to the net, then hey... so beit.
<LI>I am a monogamous married woman. Reading sexual fantasies such as in alt.sex.stories has enriched my fantasy life which in turn enriches my sex life. While sex-related "literature" is easy to come by (pun intended), downloading and accessing truly pornographic pictures is not at all easy. I mean, what the hell do I do with a .jpg or a binary???
<LI>I like it a lot
<LI>Sex is great.  We love Sex. Everyone have sex. MORE SEX!!!
<LI>There should be more... it's a beautiful thing!
<LI>Sex is a part of life.  The Net is no different than the rest of the world, nor should it be.  Freedom of expression is one of the most important rights we have, and it must be preserved.
<LI>should be unrestricted for adults
<LI>I think, very interesting
<LI>it's usually what i look for
<LI>It is a way to  express  and delve into the many different forms and fashions.  Its differences in the individual which makes the world so interesting to live in..
<LI>As it is a facet of life, sex is a facet of the Internet.
<LI>jerk off in the wheelchair everybody!!!
<LI>It's an adequate medium in this era of aids and safe sex
<LI>i find it to be a relaxing way to communicate my sexual desires, and helps me relive many of my frustrations.
<LI>Why don't people start taking responsibility for their own actions and stop worrying about everyone else?
<LI>Human sexuality is as natural as eating. Why the drive to censor ?
<LI>What's the big deal?
<LI>It's fun to read and fun to talk to people about my foot fetish.
<LI>N/A
<LI>I like it but I cannot find a talker that allows pedophillia
<LI>I find this survey insulting! My own preferences have absolutely nothing to do with the validity of my answers. This could have been done intelligently, without all the S&M questions. The only reason I even answered this was to balance out all the pervert
<LI>I think there is nothing better than sex and perversion and it should continue to be a pervasive part of the net
<LI>from what i have seen it is highly overated
<LI>should be more of it.
<LI>luv it on irc!!!!
<LI>Some of it can be a little extreme.  (beastiality, kids}
<LI>no bid deal
<LI>no cencuro
<LI>The good things either costs money or is difficult to reach
<LI>It's oke. It's a big part of your live. Use it and enjoy!!!
<LI>If the InterNet is the "Information Super Highway" then it must NOT be censored by any entity other than by the people who use it. This government (USA) or its people do not have the right to enforce their morality on the rest of the world.
<LI>

<LI>It's softer than sex in a bookstore or in 42nd street in NYC
<LI>Whats the big deal. I've found it easier to download/view pornography from regular BBS's. 
<LI>i think sex on the internet is okay. but it's to hard to find anything good. unless i'm just looking in the wrong place. i'm new to the inter net so that's prbally my problem.
<LI>amusing
<LI>I look on the internet for sexual release and find it increasingly difficult to locate .....anything !
<LI>It is definitely made for us dick-ruled males.
<LI>i m new to the net but believe that sex in any avenue should be dealt with more honestly and openly to put a stop to the puritianical attitude.
<LI>there is so much more on the net besides Sex
<LI>I wish it was easir to find.  I also wish I knew how to use the MPG, GL and other viewers.
<LI>I believe that censorship of the net completely negates its purpose; people should be able to view what they want to view in the privacy of their homes.  I am furious with the "moral majority" telling society what is or is not appropriate for them.
<LI>It relives you of inhibitions -- makes you open your min and jump out of your box!
<LI>A nice mental break from micro programming
<LI>YES!!!!!!!!
<LI>ITS GREAT, BUT I WISH IT WAS EASIER TO GET AHOLD OF HARD-CORE PORNOGRAFY!
<LI>I have no problems with it.  I oppose censorship, but agree that there should be a product that allows for parents to lock children away from certain sites.
<LI>there isa wall between my sexal tendencies and my intellectual goal. so, idon't want tobe intelectual reduced, because i was sexual actve, espicially with animal
<LI>It is nice to look at and a good learning and teaching tool
<LI>think it fun ans exciting
<LI>More! More! More!
<LI>could be better if i knew more
<LI>I feel that parents should be the mian censors of sex on the net. It is their responsibility. The government should have some sort of rating system and more restrictions to ensure that only those over 18 have access, but that access should be free and open.
<LI>its not to bad but ive had people asking for cybersex quite often.
<LI>I find it factual and fun.  I use it for both information and pleasure.  It is very easy to be offended by material found on the net.
<LI>It's there for those who enjoy it. I doubt very much that it contributes to crime, etc.
<LI>It is no worst than the public library!
<LI>It's o-kay sometimes, if your in the mood to look for it.
<LI>we need more
<LI>Being new to the internet I do not have much to contribute as this is the first occassion to see anything remotely envoling the ? of sex.
<LI>I think it's great and I don't want it taken away.
<LI>It's an outlet for fantasies. I have trouble imagining it being anything more.
<LI>Sex on the internet is a wonderful thing if it's not abused or goverment doesn't become involved.  It increases the chance that people are going to have safe sex and it provies a comfortable enviorment for people to enjoy their sexuality safely reguardles
<LI>don't know yet
<LI>I feel its fine. 
<LI>Ithink its great
<LI>We need more, More, MORE!
<LI>easy to find, turns me on, it's great!!!
<LI>I think there is more talk about it than actual practice. And I don't mind what people do, as long as nobody starts censoring the Net because of some (imaginary) sexual 'misuses'.
<LI>It turns me on.  What I have found.  I wish there was an easier way to get to it.
<LI>We need more sex on the internet
<LI>I think it's a very good idea
<LI>match made in heaven
<LI>It is rather difficult finding some things.  Perhaps with more experience utilizing the net I will know where to look and how to access any information.
<LI>It's a part of the essence of the Internet (Open Information)!
<LI>cool!
<LI>The uproar caused by X / R rated material on the net has been blown out of all proportion!
<LI>Sex On the internet is made out to be a big deal, I think that it is helpin the world!
<LI>Parents are the key to correct upbringing. The internet is for adults or parental guidence.  The internet is no different than walking into a city.
<LI>Sex is where you find it.  If you're looking you'll find it.
<LI>It's important
<LI>I, who does not use the internet for sex of any description, feel that a lot of emphasis is placed on something (sex) which occupies such a small part of the internet.  I beleive (although I have not investigated this fully) that most "sex" found on the net is available through other means eg magazines, word of mouth or exchange of photos etc.  Children could find adult material from their owm families and take that to the school ground too.  If we look back at our own childhood, sex was always a contr
versial issue.  In summary, I beleive that governments and authorities are afraid of the internet as a whole and are using issues, such as sex and crime, to stir up the public so regulation and censorship can be arranged.  I wish to stress that I beleive that sex and crime are definitely in the minority of the internet resources available.  And this is a small sacrifice to pay for such global uncensored communication.
<LI>Personal Choice. Parental responsability. Individual responsability. I found more sexual material 25 years ago on the news racks and locker rooms than I do on the Net today!
<LI>The specific web providers have the ability to police their specific web sites.
<LI>not much pornography on the net 
<LI>great
<LI>It's great
<LI> i wish it were easier to locate and download images from a central source, or many sources that are much easier to track.
<LI>over used and over explioted finacially
<LI>it is a great way to anonymously express and explore your sexuality. i feel that is important, especially in our society, where you are judged unjustly and ostrisized for exploring your sexuality.
<LI>It should not be banned!!!!
<LI>There are too many companys that want money to view pics.
<LI>I'm trying to find it before the police state takes it away
<LI>I think it shouldn't be there!!
<LI>not a bad idea, for the most part compleatly harmless, and keeps (possibly) some of the perverts at home instead of on the streets raping/insulting women.
<LI>It's not that big a deal
<LI>still mild compared to whats been happening on bbs's for years
<LI>I like having the access, but do believe that it needs to be controled to some point so that people are aware that it is there and that certain people should not have access.
<LI>The net has no more sex on it than there is in the real world. There is just as much sex on TV, in magazines, and throughout the cities as there ever will be on the net. It is impossible to censor it - Imagine making a law that all magazines that contain sexual material be outlawed - and then add on the fact that law would have to be INTERNATIONAL. Its not going to happen - as well it shouldn't. Oh yea - Cool picture at the bottom of the page =)
<LI>Like most of the Internet, a lot of hype and not much substance
<LI>This is a matter of personal , adult choice , and should be left to the individual , not bigotted ,narrow minded zealots and busy-bodies wiyh nothing better to do . Regarding child access to the NET , it should be a parent/guardian responsibility to monitor NET activity . 
<LI>I think there should be more sex on the internet, I enjoy it very much
<LI>I think that it is a fun & exciting way to express sexuality.  However, I do fear that children may get involved, & not realize what they are getting into.
<LI>great
<LI>Hey, let people do what they want. I mean, if someone wants to get off on computer generated images- go for it!
<LI>I like it, would like to find a woman or couple that just comes out and says would like to find someone to fuck or suck. also would like contacts by location in the USA>
<LI>I think sex on the internet is great.  It's really fun, and everyone should try to find this kind of stuff on the net.
<LI>The Internet has provided me with an alternative to bestiality. Thank you.
<LI>I would hate to see chat sites monitored. I think Americans should be free to choose for themselves. We don't want the government to monitor everything we do. I think a rating system would be enough.
<LI>To me more of a curiosity than anything brought on by all the talk that has been in the media
<LI>I don't know yet!
<LI>Parents should supervise kids on the Net, this isn't a babysitting service. Parents who don't, are the main cause of their childs problem-Inadequate parenting!
<LI>great!!!
<LI>Since it's always going to be on the net, we need a way of dealing with it. Children always have had access to magazines and videos.  I think the media has blown the whole thing way out of proportion
<LI>I love all aspects of sex on the net.  LET IT STAY AS IS!!!!
<LI>Personally, I'm annoyed by trapsites, like the "you're a loser" page.
<LI>I enjoy hunting down sexy places on the net, but I don't want my children to do likewise. Parental controls _ and I'm not sure exactly what's available _ should be the answer to any perceived "problem" of sexual materials on the net.
<LI>It is discouraging to see special interest groups trying to censor what ought to be a free forum.
<LI>It has been blown way out of proportion by the media. They really don't know anything about the 'net.
<LI>It's just part of normal life. Except for parental supervision of minor children, let the market place make the rules.
<LI>There should be absolutely NO censorship on net.
<LI>The net should remain a place where all can exchange free information.No censorship should apply other than the on\off button we all have. While sex is open on the net it is monitorable; try to stop it and it goes underground, which is more of a risk.  It should be fun!!
<LI>The Sex and InTERNET are sports, practice them
<LI>Hard to find and too much for Apple McIntosh
<LI>I have seen ads for sexually related topics or products and have followed the links to check it out but most of these did not allow much more than info about the item and most were quite expensive and required verification.
<LI>My answer to the previous question is not"difficult" (your arrow is outside the reach of my computer)  it is "you have to be specifically looking for it".  As to sex on the internet, it should be more difficult for children to access it (kids are sometimes much more "internet and computer savvy" than their parents, and this fact should not allow the availability of information to supersede authority of parents, which it currently does.
<LI>I'm brand new to the Internet, and haven't run across anything offensive yet.  I think if I accidentally ran across something in a place I didn't expect it, I'd be wary of the whole internet idea. I want to know what is at a site - not be shocked when I get there.
<LI>a good idea.
<LI>great
<LI>You will never stop pornography. It has been with us through the ages. Sex is an integral part of human consciousness and is (usually !) unsupressable. Parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children. In what thy watch on TV, what they learn, which school they go to, for raising them as individuals. Part of this can be internet access. Parents cannot say they don't know what is there if they allow their children access as this is grossly irresponsible. Providers are going to have to help p
rents, say, provide access resticted logins ( ie. no 'pornographic' newsgroups ), but there are always sites to access. This is the drawback, but parents should take on this responsibility as internet access is 99.9% purchased though credit cards, so ... parents buy in - parents regulate. It is their responsibility. You cannot restict everyone just for the sake of a relatively small fraction of net-users.
<LI>parents are the key for viewing 
<LI>Interesting.
<LI>I like it.
<LI>It's there. What can I do about it? Not much. There is always going to be this sorta stuff.
<LI>lobe it
<LI>It's interesting.
<LI>Wish you would fondle my pussy.  I am so wet and my mipples are erect with desire!
<LI>Don't know yet -- all my time on the internet is at work so I'm too scared of getting caught.  I suspect it would be fun at first but grow dull.  I would have liked to explore it more when I was single.
<LI>People who have a healthy marrage don't need sex on the Internet. Sex is something to be enjoyed by married couples.
<LI>I'm aways looking for it and I should have access to it all.
<LI>nice very nice
<LI>it can be cool
<LI>NEED MORE VIDEO ACCESS.  
<LI>sex on the net is great
<LI>It can be a great outlet for closeted desires.  It can also make one realize that nobody's fantasies are really unique.  And its the safest sex available!
<LI>OK
<LI>porno!!!! porno!!!! porno!!!!  to hard to find
<LI>It's fine with me - I don't burn up the keyboard seeking it out, but I do know it's there if I want it and that's as it should be - thanks.  Just as long as Big Brother and the religious fanatics (trying to save "our children and the world at large" stay 
<LI>more! more! more!
<LI>ok
<LI>I find myself in a problem that has no easy solution when it comes to Sex and the Internet.  I don't believe government has a right to "shut it down", but I do beleive we nned to somehow police it to keep it from our children.  The problem:  how to do this ... ?
<LI>I think that on the Internet, like anywhere else, the key is to provide the education necessary to make the experience of finding this type of material on the network not a surprising one, or a condemned one that children will try to experience in order to defy their parents.
<LI>I hope to find people that share my phantasy (just on the net!)
<LI>why not?
<LI>The internet is the best forum for all types of sexuality to communicate with each other and exchange views and promote friendship around the world
<LI>Great! No fucking cencorships and stuff. I want more sex on the Net!!!
<LI>I LOVE IT!!
<LI>It is easy to become perverted and sexually stimulated 
<LI>blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
<LI>does't make any difference
<LI>internet has no effect
<LI>LEAVE THE INTERNET ALONE FOR PEOPLE TO DO AS THEY LIKE
<LI>I find NO OFFENSE in sex & the 'Net. I ENJOY it,and promote it as a good diversion.
<LI>very dangerous for children. it cannot be controlled at all.  
<LI>Nicer to watch
<LI>should be much more exciting!
<LI>I believe it is a right to have unrestricted sex on the net.
<LI>Well, obviously I am biased because I found this page. Tell parents to take responsibilty for THEIR own children in THEIR own house if they don't want them to see pron. If they don't like what they see, turn it off, don't turn ME off.
<LI>Because of my "condition" as a TV, I've gained a lot from the net. I've found contact's to other TV/TS's, TV/TS oriented shops, usergroups and the like. So all in all I think that "sex on the Internet" as you put it, could help a lot of people. A lot more people than it could hurt! BTW... I think that you should expand certain fields of your survey, with a 'other' field, so that it would be possible to tell more precise what one would answer to a particular field. Thanks.
<LI>they're both great..
<LI>I like sex - I like the internet - So there you have it!
<LI>its great, i get satified
<LI>shoul be more 
<LI>I think this is regulation that create problem like rape, pedophillia, homosexuality, etc. I everybody was free  to make love, the need of sex should be less present. The sex is taboo, this is the mistake.
<LI>If it helps me a partner, I think it's Great!
<LI>I think it's a "service" that should continue .....
<LI>Just another way of having sex!
<LI>Free and Free and Think something about ...
<LI>I have no objections to ANY sex on the net.
<LI>I LIKE TO RUB MY PUSSY WITH MY MOUSE WHILE I LOOK AT PICTURES OF LUCKY VANOUS!!!
<LI>broadens the mind
<LI>Its easier to talk about problems, if you not facing the other one.
<LI>a harmless outlet and source of information
<LI>Great
<LI>I think it's good, I like it, and it's very safe !
<LI>There should be no censorship, and only service provider regulation. What you see should be what you get.
<LI>The internet isn't a children only area.  Sex is part of most adult's lives, and internet reflects that (more openly than in real life, but so what).  I do think there should be a rating system so that people know what they will be getting.  A rating system would also help with "netnanny" type programs.  If something doesn't have a 'G' or "PG" rating, the program wouldn't let a child access it.
<LI>fucking goog thing
<LI>The net is an environment in which people can pseudo-anonymously carry out their wildest fantasies without a majority of the repercussions of real life
<LI>

<LI>Greatly over-rated.
<LI>It's new media for underground.
<LI>has helped me open up to taboo subjects and ideas; i still do not buy into everything i see/read, but i like the opportunity to make up my own mind.
<LI>Its great except cuddling afterwards is a problem
<LI>As in all things in life, I think the individual should control him/herself first, before endevaoring to control others.  That said and done, ALL things should be available and accessible.
<LI>hope to find sex on the net, possibly in hitherto unexperienced forms
<LI>It's not bad.
<LI>ok
<LI>It's gotten WAY out of hand!
<LI>Great! Would not change a thing.
<LI>I think the internet is a excellent source for people to find others of like interests.  New friendships are created and the feeling of being alone in a world that does not understand is reduced.
<LI>Exon should be assasinated
<LI>ATTENTION AMERICAN GOVERNMENT:  Leave it the hell alone!!!
<LI>Everyone talks about how bad the content of the net is, there is nothing here that you can't get through the US mail.
<LI>I find it interesting and stimulating
<LI>'coz I'm so shy, it's good that I can enjoy here easily..:)
<LI>I think we should as adults have it if we want it. If you don't want it you don't have to look at it, the same as getting a dirty video.
<LI>I'm still a virgin, and was curious about all the consequences and physical and emotional conditions involved in sex, so I turned to the 'net rather than Penthouse to find answers.  I've been overwhelmed, and disgusted, and on whole, I've been desensitized by this deluge of information, and have become numb to the chastity and importance of sex.
<LI>It's impossible to suppress or censor sexual traffic on the Internet.  However, providers and users need to think about the consequences of their actions on the net.  Moreover, promotion of good netiquette needs to be strengthened.  I see too many hostile and inappropriate messages on the newsgroups.  True, they cannot be prevented entirely, but there should be stern access penalties for those who abuse their access privileges.
<LI>It doesn't bother me one way or another.
<LI>Good, relaxant insted of boring computers
<LI>It's great, you can meet people who have the same fantasies as yourself. I met a couple of people who are into something rare like me ;-)
<LI>More private than sex shoppes.
<LI>I think it's up to the the user to know what to look at. And it is possible to inform people about risks with sex used the wrong way.
<LI>It's basically a non-issue.
<LI>If your are open minded, there's no problems
<LI>I met my current lover while surfing the net.  She caught me downloading nude pictures and asked me if I wanted to see the real thing instead.  Obviously, I answered in the affirmative.  She gives the best head I have ever had in my life.
<LI>I think the net could be of great help to parents wanting to teach their children about sex, but are too embarresed to talk about it. The net has a great potentional, if used right.
<LI>I think that it causes people to forget their morals and their happiness that they have otherwise.
<LI>one word:  more!
<LI>It allows you to explore things without exposing yourself 
<LI>The Internet provides freedom of sexual expression and should not be censored.
<LI>it's great!!, but it must be a restricted way for childrens
<LI>It has been very interesting to me that most conversations between strangers meeting online eventually become sexual.  Perhaps its one topic that everyone is interested in to one degree or another.  
<LI>I feel that the internet should be COMPLETELY open.
<LI>You can never have enough of either.
<LI>It's a form of freedom
<LI>The NET allows for a casual interest in this sort of thing, also allowing a person to 'sample' new areas (not just sex, by the way) to see what they are interested in.  The net should remain completely uncensored by the authorities, it would only ruin a particularly special and effecive info. source!
<LI>I 'dlike to find sex without difficulty
<LI>Sex is part of life and can't be ignored, but pornography is bad.
<LI>It's there, easy to get to, but most people won't access it, it's so much easier to go to a shop and get a magazine or phone chat-lines.
<LI>I love to chat about SEX!  No harm, just pure clean fun.
<LI>It's out of control, but should not be censored.  That's the beauty of the Internet.  It should be self-governing, and any censorship should only be  done for parents/guardians of children.  Advertizing for sex, however, should be removed (ie 900 numbers from Prodigy/AOL/etc.).
<LI>Fuck yourself!
<LI>younggirls fucking
<LI>Sex and the Internet should be available in much the same way as printed material, if you want it OK, if you dont OK.  The individual (or Guardian) should decide whether to view adult material, without attemptling to enforce their beliefs on others.  If more people would be responcible for their own (or their charges) actions we would not have to contend with censorship.
<LI>....
<LI>No censure, more bandwidth! That's what I crave for.
<LI>If no one gets hurt and parents monitor their childrens access the what's the harm?
<LI>I think it great
<LI>like watching tv......change the channel
<LI>It's OK
<LI>It would be a nice future to have a fantastic night with an American girl through internet. :-)
<LI>I think in light of the emerging trend towards commercializm on the net, that all these arguements will be mute within a few short years.
<LI>Forming an opinion
<LI>hi !
<LI>it's an easy way for people embarassed about sex to see things about sex, without the embarassment.
<LI>Reminds me of the peak days of CB radio only with pictures and less static.
<LI>over rated
<LI>*yawn*
<LI>just my life
<LI>Much ado about very little.  Sex is everywhere; always was and always will be.
<LI>Real sex is better!
<LI>I like to shoot my creamy load on the screen when I see the sexy babe on this web page.
<LI>The Internet is mainly college-age males. Of course there's going to be a lot of sexual stuff out there!
<LI>I can never find it when I need it!!!!!!
<LI>I think it is definatly there.  If you want it you can find it.  But, just because it is there dosn't mean that it should be abused or that children should see it.  I think parents guardians should take the effort to teach the children and to monitor thier activity.
<LI>non-issue.  Washington is turning up the heat here to discourage communications amongst the politically active.
<LI>I hope the gov't doesn't censor it all due to the kiddies.
<LI>at this stage i am new to the net and although i have been looking for light nudes have found very few so believe if people want they should be allowed  to find
<LI>It's fun.And harms nobody.The goverrnment  should stay out of it.They screw up everything they get involvd with anyway.
<LI>If you're looking for it, its out there, if you're not interested, you can avoid it.
<LI>I have not gone looking. But if this medium is to grow like the movies or TV there must be a way to establish self control. I would recommend some sort of self governing body that establihes Ratings for a site and Browsers that can be configureded at the workstation to provide password control for those sites. I would like to give my 12 year daughter unlimited access to internet but will not under the current situation.  There is material that is without redeeming value on the net and access should be 
ontrolled.  
<LI>it's ok as long as people don't take it too seriously like they are now.  If you look you will find it, so in order for children to find it, they have to already know it's out there and look for it.  Meaning that parents *already* have failed in discouraging it
<LI>it's bound to happen, it's human nature!
<LI>It's OK 
<LI>Not accessible enough
<LI>Reflects the freedom of the Net, everyone has their say. ok
<LI>If it is only erotic it is o.k., because you can see such stuff everyday on TV. Hardcore is another thing, but the Internet should be free and selfregulating.
<LI>Stimulating at first but in no way can approach intimate contact with another person.
<LI>kool beanz
<LI>Internet should be open for Sex and should be free, not censored.
<LI>In this time of AIDS, thank God for the Internet which gives me a safe outlet for my sexuality.
<LI>fucking great! More Sexpictures...
<LI>Could be better with some vr and electrical chocks
<LI>just for fun!
<LI>Keep it up but monitor it. Local gouverments should restrict access.
<LI>silly
<LI>It's an open frontier!
<LI>I think it's great.
<LI>I think i'ts great
<LI>Censership, by anyone but one's self must not be allowed.  Notes about content is a good idea. You are only a free as your information and data are. 
<LI>it's most interesting in that everyone seems so interested
<LI>I am new to the internet and so have had difficulty finding serious hard pornography. I am not looking for sexual encounters but only like following others attempts at getting sex.
<LI>great!
<LI>Getting a partner would be helpful for most of the losers on the net.  If they had someone maybe it wouldn't be such a big deal.
<LI>take it or leave it
<LI>Should be more women online.
<LI>Most of the media attention has be sensationalistic hype, and very ill-informed  and un researched.  In general sexual content is well protected from any casual contact, you have to go searching for it very specifically.
<LI>just leave it there!
<LI>The Internet, among other things, is still a bunch of toys.  They should, therefore, all be available to us kids.  We'll decide later what to do with them all.
<LI>Freedom of speech, if the law is worried about it I think they should go and get, drug dealers and thifes.
<LI>Censorship, not sex, is evil! As adults we should have access to any type of material we choose. Leave it up to parents, not the state to monitor and control children's use of the net.
<LI>I think it's lame, so I haven't looked for it. I enjoy sex very very much, and have no desire to look for stuff, but I am always wierded out by the number of men who do. I think it's really sad that they can't think of other, less degrading, more interesting ways to satisfy sexual desire.
<LI>I feel that the Net has allowed me to come into contact with my true feelings, discussing them with people of similar views and circumstances
<LI>The Inet provides an honest (if a bit "stressed") place for communications. Rather than censoring the net (impossible anyway), it's the responsibility of adult users to control the access of their children to material they find objectionable. The communications taking place can--and do--open users to new ideas and values, to everyone's benefit!
<LI>For myself,it provides endless entertainment for an otherwise dull existance.As for children,i'd rather they view porn,than violence.
<LI>Honestly, I'm glad. I'm not as sexually repressed as I used to be. Keep in mind I use the internet daily. For sexual purposes, I probably use it weekly.
<LI>fgjhfgj
<LI>one day people will have to face up to the truth. we find truth in things we cannot control. the internet was created so it caouldn't easily be controlled. it would be a pity if the net were controlled by anyone in any way. I think the openness of the net will contributes in the end, to openness in society.
<LI>If you know that it's just fantasy, then you're fine
<LI>i'm excited to experience it and open my mind.
<LI>it is a new alternative that must be more closely studied. it is still young as is growning fast.unfortunate instancess may mar the subject, but anyway individuales can find to meet safely is great.
<LI>I think the level of sex on the Internet is no more than the level of sex anywhere else in the free world. Children should be monitered to prevent them from exposing certain sexually orientated materials on the Net. Many software programs are available and more are in the works to prevent access to certain areas of the Net. I believe final responsiblity lies with the parents.
<LI>I find it hard to believe that people have spent thousands of dollars for computer equipment only to view smut and engage in sexual perversions on the net.
<LI>You can legislate moral values
<LI>its better than the book/video store.  
<LI>There's something for everyone, every taste - not surprising that the moral right panicked. They're convinced any kind of sex is basically evil, so when you show them all kinds of fun and imaginative sex...can't be surprised.
<LI>I have a child by a woman I met on the internet.  As a father, I think that children should not have easy access to sexual material, but I think a partnership between service providers and parents is necessary.
<LI>I find nothing wrong with sex on the net.Adults should be free to do whatever they want,as long as it doesn't hurt or infringe on some else's rights.
<LI>Has increased self-confidence and sexual activity. Positive.
<LI>If our society were less puritanical and more open about sex, there would be fewer adolescents pushing carriages around.  It is a healthy outlet if we satisfy our desire and move on.  That's how we grow.
<LI>Our society is too preoccupied with the subject, because qwe keep all types of sexual issues in the closet.  Everthing from viewing images to open discussion is taboo.  If we dealt with sex in a mature and open fashion, our kids would be educated and the need to experiment would be diminished.  We can thank christian teachings for the plethora of teenages pushing baby carriages in this country.  I am not referring to the churchs' teachings on birth control, but rather with the "if you sin you wil burn 
n hell" approach (the stick) to teaching morals.
<LI>Please don't make it too convenient to find.
<LI>I'm glad it's there.  things I'd NEVER ask anyone are spoken of openly. I understand myself and my body better.
<LI>i love it !!!!!
<LI>Sex is human, so why not put it on the Internet?
<LI>I am a adult content provider so I guess my opinion is a biased one however, I believe in the freedom of expression in most areas of sexuallity. 
<LI>It is an overhyped topic. Too much anal retentive nonsense.
<LI>The "Sex" subject is wider than I thought
<LI>It is a good information media for those that desire it.
<LI>uncertain
<LI>I think if you want to find pornagraphy thats your choice.
<LI>It is just as easy to find porn and sex in the real world as it is to find porn and sex on the Net.  The Net is far safer, however.
<LI>binaries news are fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>There should be more of it
<LI>What I think of sex and the Internet. Responsible People should have a (PASS-WORD) so the children will Not have access to the Internet. For the Parents this is the 90's    
<LI>Sex FAQs are helpful.
<LI>Should be regulated, but NOT restricted.
<LI>Its really not all that exciting...
<LI>Haven't found all that much, except to really look for it, It seems that the news stories on TV brings more interest for those that didn't know how or where to find it.
<LI>Mostly fantasy, it is.
<LI>good masturbation material
<LI>Not a real problem
<LI>I'm glad there are ways to access sex-related material online.
<LI>Live and let live.  Parents are responsible for their children.  They do not allow there children to drink at home, so they should apply the same rules to the internet.  It is time parents take some responsibility ans stop blaming the Government.  The people are the Government!  I parents can not be responsible for bringing up their kids, they should not have them!
<LI>I think sex and the internet allows people to express themselves without fear of "too" public exposure.
<LI>If sex is banned, then free thinking & expression will follow!!
<LI>okay for those who are searching for it, but I think that the internet should control the amoung of sex material that can be viewed.  It should also have more sex pictures of men and or stuff that would be of interest for females and not just for men.  For example, naked women together, the "ideal " fantacy for a man. 
<LI>People are making it a bigger issue than they should.  The internet should be left open as it always has been in the past.  Law should stay off the net....
<LI>All they have to do is enforce the present laws.
<LI>don't know
<LI>I think it's good fun, but some of the fetish stuff is disgusting. I just stay away from stuff that offends me.
<LI>Much better than reading the sex magazines
<LI>Sex in the net is surprising. There's the dirtiest stories written by women, the most stupid misconceptions teenager americans have about sexual variations, there's the best hints and tips for any kinds of sex, there's IRC channels where guys are girls and women are not, and everybody has good time, and there's IRC -channels where gay men have to hide under female nicks to avoid from str8 women "rescuing" them, and lesbian channels that resemble more a smoking battlefield than a chat-channel, because e
ery other 14-year old nerd tries to take the channel over just to show he can "handle" lesbian women, too. Then there's AOLusers posting "Me Too" to alt.sex.* requesting nonexistent XXX-ftp -site listings. In the Net there's people like AnnD, SueNH, Elf and other "specialists". The Net is a place of sexual extremes, were they how kinky or how vanilla... because it all blurs.
<LI>after the sex=death AIDS fear that destroyed my ability to enjoy sex, it is nice to ponder the possibilities again.  I got myself so programmed not to think of sex anymore that I felt sexless, all of my friends did this too and I think we sort of became dead inside.  I would not activley go find a sex chat line or magazine outside my home so the Net is a sort of innocent re-introduction until I reawaken to the real thing again.  Use it or lose it.    
<LI>It's the same as with any other medium (Magazines, Movies, videos).  It's there to find for adults (or kids) that want it, but can be avoided by those who don't.
<LI>Freedom of Speech...People should be allowed to do what they want to do on the NET
<LI>As with any other subject of human interest it as to be on the NET
<LI>I like it!
<LI>Keep government out!
<LI>I think adults should have it if they want it but I do not like the idea of not knowing if you are speaking or dealing with a minor.
<LI>i am looking for a man to talk with and possibly have cyber sex with, but am having trouble, please if you can help write midnite@netaxs.com  thanXXX
<LI>People should be able to find what they are looking for.
<LI>The Internet is the only place where the 1st Amendment is completely operative.
<LI>Sex is not just on the Internet, its every where.  Sex is a part of what we are and is a natural function of our existence.  Parents should decide when their children are old enough to know about sex and monitor what information and access they have to sexual material be that on the internet or any where else.
<LI>lots of good safe sex information
<LI>The net provides unique insights into some sexual activities that one might not normally see or even hear about. Therefor it is a multi-cultural tool.
<LI>it's ok and proper
<LI>If you can handle the subject, it's fine.
<LI>It is very open.  Every possible type of orientation is available.
<LI>its bloody good!
<LI>I think it is a way to allow adults to be more open with what htey are looking for.  They can experiment with open discussions without anyone knowing who they are.  It is a great way to share experiences
<LI>I think its good..Keep it the way it is.
<LI>That's good. A forum for expression. Just like for the other subjects. But Pictures or stories about sex acts considered like crimes should not be authorised.
<LI>I think people make to much fuss about it
<LI>Sex in Internet should be allowed as well as any other part of human activity.
<LI>somewhat interesting, like it in the privacy of my home.
<LI>I think the Internet provides a valuable forum for sex talk etc and would help in the release of a lot of pent up/suppressed sexual energy. However I'm not too sure how this development effects peoples' ability to actually relate sexually in the real world. Maybe future generations will become totally alien to traditional forms of sexual expression, being replaced by virtual sex etc.
<LI>I love sex. I hate censorship. Keep the Internet free!
<LI>I WANT PUBLIC CUSEEME EXHIBITIONS!
<LI>It despert libid and i like to see. But one thing should be said. In almost (if not all) places, we are warned that there are adult oriented material in there. So, we only watch if we want to!
<LI>Jeder muss selber wissen, was er will !
<LI>I have no objection to sex on the internet, provided it is not a tool for child molesters, pedophiles, etc to search for support in their crimes.  It should also not be used to commit or assist to commit crimes.  People that post these types of messages should be flamed, and the messages should be deleted by whoever sees them.  I hope we stay self regulatory.
<LI>Kids make sex from fourteen (average) on, so why should the not be allowed to see how it workes from 0 on??? Sex is natural and nothing to hide for children or anybody, except  for people who do not like it. And they should just stay out and should not post 'stop this shit xxx'. Remove the idiots and non-openminded people from the net, not the sex.
<LI>i enjoy it to an extent
<LI>Sex become international, you can meet exactly what corresponds to your desire
<LI>I don't have aproblem with the information found on the net.  I feel that if someone wants to find something there then they shouldn't be restricted from finding it.  Many people may in fact be helped by what they find, such as couples needing ideas to rekindle romance in their lives.
<LI>Love it. Keep it.
<LI>dull
<LI>Whats the big deal-I am not forced to read it-Ithink my esc key still works.
<LI>I think that the government should mind its own business, and if that we want to have sex on the net...that's our business
<LI>I want more sex related stuff.

<LI>no big deal
<LI>Rather Big sites, but hard to find (execpt for alt.bin*)
<LI>It surprised me to find so many like-minded people on the net.  It made me realize that my interests are not perverse but rather a part of who I am.  Thus, it allowed for a greater freedom of self-expression
<LI>It's cool!
<LI>Much too much fuzz about it, so much for the American way of life. People are responsible for their own morals. I don't need some bloody US-senators to tell me what I can see/access. BTW, if you ask for people being T*, it would be advisable to ask whether they are MTF or FTM, too, and if there are on the net only, or out with it. Makes a LOT of a difference!
<LI>Goverment hands off the Net...
<LI>Far to much pedophilia and NC 
<LI>Yet another diversion!
<LI>allows you to be more open
<LI>Sex and the Internet was always a logical progression.  If parents have a problem with their children getting on, then that is the parent's issue.  The same applies to the religious fanatics who spoil everyones fun on some channels,they should stick to their own and not preach.  Personally I am not into young kids and teens, but provided it is done in a secure environment and no one gets hurt, then I do not see a problem.
<LI>Celibate is not a "sexual orientation."  Sexual orientation describes one's sexual *desires and attractions* -- it can be homosexual, heterosexual, or bisexual.  Celibacy describes one's sexual *behavior*.  A celibate person could have heterosexual or homosexual desires.  A person with heterosexual or homosexual desires could choose to be celibate.  Please spell adultery correctly.  Your misspellings and incorrect use of terminology lead me to believe that you are a teenager.  I think this survey is ve
y shallow.  For example, under #8, "What sexual aspects are you into?" why don't you list things like monogamy, faithfulness, having children, raising a family, love, affection, conversation, trust, etc.?  Or don't these have anything to do with sex?  Under #9, "In what way do you feel the Internet contributes to sex?" how about an option that says, "The Internet is simply a tool.  Depending on the person, it can be used for any or all of the above or for none of the above."  Under #10, "What level of expe
ience have you had with sex on the Net?" how about an item that says, "Have had intelligent and mature discussions on subjects relating to sexuality," and, "Have discussed the religious and spiritual aspects of sexuality."  In #14, "Are you in favor of children having access to online sexual material?" you fail to distinguish between being "in favor of" children accessing sexual material and being "in favor of" government regulation of the Internet.  I can be opposed to children accessing sexually explicit
content and at the same time believe that parents rather than government should guide their children.
<LI>I like both. :-)
<LI>I believe that the Internet, like any place where many and varied people meet and converse, is going to be a place where sexuality make a showing.  I also think that this is the healtheist thing in the world, a place where people are free to say and do things without fear of personal retribution.  As I stated above, individual freedom, unless at the expense of another, is the most important thing in this or any other world.  It should be preserved at all costs.
<LI>Parents should be responsible for the actions of their children.  I am responsible for what my friends children see in my house.  The same should hold true in their own homes.  The role of parents has been lessing over the years, they are less involved in what their child do and see.  This is the reason that the net has as much trouble as it does with children.
<LI>My sex life was fine before the internet, what do you think?
<LI>I LIKE IT, DO TO HELPING ONE AN OTHER,"A RELATIONSHIP"
<LI>The safest sex I've ever had
<LI>I enjoy viewing sexually related material and am offended when others try to force thier "morals" on me
<LI>I would like it to stay... I need it!!!
<LI>THINK ABOUT IT! YOUR USING A COMPUTER TO SATISFY YOUR SEXUAL DESIRES. 
<LI>Is there any way to control what is on the net? thank you... end of conversation!
<LI>A bit overdone, but OK.  It's anyone's option not to view it.
<LI>Sexual stuff should be allowed to be viewed or whatever by adults. The hell with those self-righteous groups!
<LI>I think it's great, if you want it you can find it. Who came up with the idea that 'other' people have the right to govern what normal independant intelligent ( you must be semi smart to use the computer in the first place ) people can or cannot view in their own home for their own pleasure ?
<LI>A great time waster when one can't be bothered to work!
<LI>It's good.
<LI>Nothing's new under the sun. No net-specific sexuality has yet emerged. 
<LI>The USA should be a forerunner in openness on the net.  There should be no monitoring or regulation.
<LI>The internet is an open forum - it is up to the end user to deside what they want from the internet. It is the role of parents to ensure that their children are not exposed to any material that they deam as unsutable.
<LI>Material should be made available to teach parents what to look for/monitor to make sure their children stay away from what they find objectionable.
<LI>I dont see anything wrong with it. The problem is with the people who blow it way out of proportion. Censorship should be a self taught tool. And as for minors, parents whould be very involved with "regulating" what they see. Also, government should not have any rights to censor something I want to see. Why should the few who don't agree with it decide for me whether or not I want to see it?
<LI>The Net provides an incredible interface between the adult members of the world and  should always  remain openn to us all.
<LI>It's cool!
<LI>A natural part of the Net (and human society, as well).
<LI>ok
<LI>I believe sex is a very important issue in most human beings lives, so it is quite natural, that a worldwide communication device as the net reflects this interest. And, as I also find sex to be a profound liberation force, I see the net ad a very positive thing.
<LI>I think that it's good (for some) to have some, bud it has to have a good securety in a way of a password or something. Known to those who access it. For ex. like YR: Vip Access has...
<LI>I think that it's good (for some) to have some, bud it has to have a good securety in a way of a password or something. Known to those who access it. For ex. like YR: Vip Access has...
<LI>I think that everybody should be free to express what they wish.
<LI>Why not??
<LI>Great
<LI>I think that it's an over fed media explotation of a non-existant problem and I think that the it's an individuals choice what he looks at.
<LI>To other parents/guardians of minors (children) don't give up your rights and responsibilites to 'teach and instruct your children'.  The internet, online services etc., like tv/video games etc, are a tool to be used to instruct and entertain.  They are NOT a baby sitter.  Put your PC in an open area of your home and use it with your children.  You'd be surprised how much you can teach each other.
<LI>very interesting. 
<LI>Don't take it away. I love it!
<LI>I think it is cool
<LI>Wonderful!!!
<LI>Im not
<LI>It´s very good
<LI>There is not much hardcore on the net that i have discoverd!!Maybe i havent looked enogh
<LI>I enjoy the fun of it.  Dont take it at all seriously
<LI>internet is only an other kind of media like books or movies. Let it go !
<LI>GREAT!!!
<LI>great
<LI>I think it is too limited and very soft on all subjects.
<LI>It's a whole new world that needs new thinking
<LI>Its not easy to find, pictures only last a few days or weeks on WWW site before its gone
<LI>great,wondful,openmined,and many more
<LI>Some sites are interesting while other sites are completel trash
<LI>Sex is part of nature.  So, what is the big deal anyway?
<LI>I believe that the internet is like money, neither good nor evil, rather it is up to the individual how they choose to use it.
<LI>harmless
<LI>Parents should be responsible for limiting their childrens' access to the adult sections of the Internet.
<LI>I highly encourage it.
<LI>Regarding children on the net. If they have access they should be allowed to find what is available electronically the same way that they can browse a library or walk down a city street. The more phobic and secretive this society is about sex then the les
<LI>The Internet is an information source.  It provides information and services that can be cencored at home.  Monitor your kid's and talk to them about what is out there.
<LI>I think its great fun and much much much safer.
<LI>I think EVERYTHING should be available!
<LI>There is less sex on the internet than there is fear of it.
<LI>It makes outrageous and strange sexual practices seem normal and proer. I once looked at alt.sex.stories and was completely shocked to find that most of the stories were of rape, strange fetishes, incest, teen sex--all rather distressing. I am afraid that if teenagers (especially teenage boys) see such material, their sexual development (i.e. feelings, desires) is going to be distorted. One could understand a 50-year-old being so jaded that he can only respond to "golden showers", but an 18-year-old? L
ok at what has come out from the Paul Bernardo case to show how people can be subverted by access to such things.
<LI>The internet is very much international and cannot be regulated, and should not be regulated. Doing so violates 1st amendment rights (at a basic level). It was argued in the 50s that communism posed a threat to the US and was considered indecent as well. You can never have anyone deciding what is indecent for someone else except parents/gardians in a parental role.
<LI>its a good thing for shureð
<LI>Sometimes, you think that's all there is on the internet... but then you realize it's because of where you hang out!
<LI>Sex should be a matter of consent, not regulation. Internet needs only rating and suited commands in the browsers... otherwise, shut down access to minors, don't shut down sexual content, freedom and creativity!
<LI>I like the idea of the " sexual freedom of the net. I thinkthat it will hrelp alot of up-tight republican's get in touch with there alter-ego's. The ppl that want to keep the net sex free, are usually the ppl who are sexually hungup. It is scary to think that some ppl answered "there needs to be international morality laws in place", and trhey were serious!!
<LI>It's nice to have sexual material available when it's wanted, and if I DIDN'T want access, that's easy to arrange also...
<LI>I enjoy all the material on the Internet (sexual and otherwise).  I don't see a need for regulating the Internet as long as parents do their job and teach their children about sex and the difference between what's right and wrong, what's moral and immoral (by their standards), and monitor their children accordingly.  Since my husband doesn't have the same sexual interests as I do, I'm very happy that this material IS available on the Internet!
<LI>I need more of it, could you e-mail me good site names?
<LI>WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It isn't as big thing as the media says. I cant find a thing
<LI>I like sex and the internet! I also think they make a great combination. People can explore themselves in a way that they couldn't or wouldn't face to face. If there is an audience for something then don't close them out, entertain them!
<LI>I love it.  I want more online places like Hustler Online, but with penetration, especially anal!
<LI>I would like to see more free xxx sites and less witch hunts
<LI>It holds a certain fasination.  Some of it is disgusting, but that's just my viewpoint.  If I don't like it, I don't download it.  People should be free to express what they want.
<LI>It's great.
<LI>Fascinating
<LI>there is a vast amount of sexual material on the network if you know how to find it all, and where to find it.
<LI>sex on the net is like sex everywhere, even our schools. In my City they found two children haveing sex in the hall, but there has been no talk of shutting down the school! the net is the last place in our once free country, to actually be free to express onesself, We HAVE to keep it that way!!!!!
<LI>safe entertainment
<LI>I think that people, particularly Americans are far too hung up over sex and nudity. If you see something you don't like, go elsewhere. Why should anybody care what others are doing? As to children, it is up to parents to raise their children - not govern
<LI>It is great!!!!
<LI>You make it a big deal, then it DOES become a big deal
<LI>To each his or her own
<LI>great !!!
<LI>cool
<LI>cool
<LI>Generally should be a parental responsibility, with the aid of parental "lockout" facilities.  The idea of rating (voluntary) is reasonable, but under no conditions can I support government control.  At best, if it's either that or something else, then the democratic net-wide body should be considered.
<LI>I want more sex
<LI>It's kind of weird, but fun.  I could never do any bi (w-w) face to face
<LI>I believe the internet will accelerate alarming trends of sexual preoccupation.
<LI>Great!!!!!!!
<LI>Sex is a natural phenomenon of humanity and an open-minded, well-adjusted perspective is vital to individual health as well as the health of society in general. Government censorship in any form is akin to tyranny. The direction of society is the responsibility of the parents, raising their children with good moral values and a healthy attitude toward sex. When the government, who have no real perspective on the common people, set arbitrary standards for us all it inhibits the free evolution of society
as well as creativity. Progress stops.
<LI>should be more openness
<LI>I love it.
<LI>Super!
<LI>I enjoy it!  People need to take responsibility for what they do/allow on the net (in terms of minors having access)  Parents should be held accountable!!
<LI>sex is human; excitement is human and has always been there. So the INternet is just a reflection of human-ness = ok.
<LI>I think it's a great way for people to explore their own sexuality in private.
<LI>In general, I don't believe that it makes sense to legislate against showing pictures of activities which are legal.
<LI>Why does the government think that EVERYTHING is its business?
<LI>I'd like to think that exposure to the unfamiliar breed tolerance.
<LI>It is not bad for mature people (over 18), but not for under 18.
<LI>It's pretty cool
<LI>It's fun...!
<LI>I have no problems with sexual material on the net. Sex is a natural thing, why do people have to hide it. The human body, no matter what "position" it is in, is an incredibly beautiful thing, every person should respect this. People without control become perverse, if you cannot control yourself then move off to some other place. The final decision when viewing or reading sexual/erotica material on the Net lies with only one person, the viewer/reader -- and that's where it should remain, not with a go
erning body. This sex thing of the Net only started when the Net became a commercial thing. The Net should be free!
<LI>I don't know!!! Really!!
<LI>like to find out
<LI>like to find out
<LI>Relatively harmless. Encourages the young males to learn net skill before moving onto more serious use of the net.
<LI>It's great, open totally new aspects on sex
<LI>The Internet is an area where mature people come at there own discretion.  They should realize that they are offended by subjectional materials and avoid such materials to stay "comfortable" SCC.
<LI>I believe sex & internet belongs together ...
<LI>It's here, so we have to deal with it.  Net.relationships are hazardous - it's too easy to get burnt - but possible.  It's great for maintainging existing long-distance relationships!  (grin)
<LI>Sex should not be restricted on the net.
<LI>Where is the real stuff?  It has in general made my life as a quad easier, I no longer need embaris others in my quest for visual stimulation.
<LI>IMHO, Parental guidance to prevent children's access is the best solution for the (percieved) moral issues, and let everyone else look after themselves.  NC stuff is suspect tho'
<LI>It's OK if the people who have access to it are old enough or have permission.
<LI>i think sex is something good and human. it is our nature, so why should we censor it? violace should be censored, not sex, like "make love, not war"
<LI>It's a good avenue for people who are shy, and could be a positive benefit for those not willing to discuss something face to face or get help with a problem.
<LI>Even without the Internet, kids would have an access to lots of sexual stuff-----But who the hell cares?? Every kid grows up like that, learning many things about sex. 
<LI>Sex on the Internet is no different than sex in the real world.  It's there.  Period.  My first sexual encounter was when I begged a non-virgin high school classmate for it.  I didn't need external influences to know what I wanted.  I enjoyed it.  Getting to the point where I could ask for it was the tough part.  DON'T MAKE PLEASURE A DIFFICULT SUBJECT TO DISCUSS!!!
<LI>The internet needs to be censored, not because of "sex" per se, but because of DANGEROUS THINGS such as Child Abuse, Murder, Terrorism and Snuff.
<LI>I think it's harmless entertainment.
<LI>If it weren't for teh net, i'd not have been able to fully accept myself as a zoophile. - "Miami" from Alt.sex.bestiality
<LI>The internet is no different from the telephone system. It is a common carrier that has no responsibility to monitor its use. Parents have the ability to block 900 #'s, and they should be able to block access to certain newsgroups and web sites. This would involve a rating system that would be keyed to block sites or a scan for keywords before displaying an article or web site.
<LI>just a new arena for the culture to face its hidden fears
<LI>I think it's fine for the people who choose itt
<LI>It's virtual sex, eyes filled, hands void(except your dick within them) :-)
<LI>Keep the internet free of censorship.  Prents should teach the values to their children that they want them to have, not the government.
<LI>I think it is a great place for free expresion.
<LI>Costs too much!
<LI>It's like the real world.  If you're willing to look hard enough, you'll find whatever you want.  It's open to abuse, but what isn't anymore in this electronic world?  I've met some wonderful people on the net.  Without it, I could never had reached out across the country, and across the world, to talk to people.  There are ALWAYS going to be people who abuse technologies.  Consenting adults do NOT need Congress to outline what they can, or cannot say to one another.  The operative phrase here is 'cons
nting.'  Naturally, children are curious.  It is up to the parents to not only teach children openness, but regulate what they can or cannot see.  Therefore, I see the need to have some sort of regulating software to disable certain access to the net - IF they feel inclined.  Personally, I see the net as the ultimate in safe sex.  
<LI>There is no more sex on the internet than in real (as opposed to "virtual") life.  I've been on the net for many many years, and find that if you aren't looking for it, you probably won't find it.  The Internet has so much more value to it, that regulating it would amount to destroying it.
<LI>I think that if people want to do it, that's their opinion, so let them do it.
<LI>I like it I  guess...
<LI>They have to be regulations for access to all public, but no censored, this could be a interesting way to interconnect the world together
<LI>Not easy enough to find!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It;s fucking awesome!
<LI>I think its something that will fade away as more people use the net daily.
<LI>I am frustrated by conservative moralists who would invoke government control over net content but deregulate everything else; it's hypocritical.  just let some private provider offer a family-oriented service.
<LI>great! for adults though!
<LI>fun...gives opportunity to explore where never had courage because identity need not be revealed
<LI>mura
<LI>I think you have to look for it, except in the cases of CHAT services from providers like AOL and Prodigy where chat-sex runs wild in the open.
<LI>People who are not interested in it should not view it
<LI>I think sex on the Internet is great!
<LI>To become experienced in finding/getting material requires a certain amount of skill, which not everyone possesses, particularly those who have no one to learn from.
<LI>I feel parents should regulate what the children see not the goverment.  I do not want someone else regulating what I do on the internet as long as I'm not maliciously causing someone else harm.  I the goverment regulates adult material on the internet then they should also regulate religous material also.  In the last 3 centureys more people have been killed or severly hurt in the name of religion then by anything relating to sex or ponography.
<LI>It is there to view if you wish.
<LI>it's something very strange.
<LI>The last thing we need is more laws...Parants should be the ones who control their kids...not the Government. I know that many households both parants work so perhaps it would be wise to put a access code system on the  internet services locally or nationally. Then the parents could accdes the adult materials by just entering a code or password. This is a far as I would go. If people do not like see adult materials then no one is forcing them to veiw it. The people that want to ban this type of enterta
nment are the first to talk about their freedoms & rights ...we all have rights & as long as we do not hurt one another we as adults should be able to view & enjoy what we desire...the kids of today are exposed to a lot of things in the real world even the local Newscast are violent. I think that we as parents must do our job and not relay on Big Brother to raise our kids. It might even help if we would get a little hardnose on the people that we put in jail and not be so fast to release them. Jails should
be jails & not Resort1 Thanks for taking the survey!
<LI>Never really thought much about it. Like just about everyone else I download erotic pictures and such from time to time, but the thing about having so-called net-sex (or tinysex if you're in a MUSH) is that it feels silly. I mean, you sit there writing dirty words at eachother? Big deal.
<LI>pics ok
<LI>IRC is a great way to meet like-minded people, especially those who aren't afraid to send pix via dcc.  I've even ended up visiting some of them.  You can usually see through the posers.
<LI>The USA is an open society. The Net must reflect that as well in my opinion. Parents can provide precautions for minor children and sensitive adults need not wander into invironments in which they may be offended. If they do, its their problem!! 
<LI>I met my husband on a talker, but neither of us engaged in net sex
<LI>Get rid of it on the Internet!
<LI>Awesome stuff...
<LI>Sex is a central aspect of our humanity and spirituality.  I am not surprised that there is a huge amount of sex related material on the Internet.
<LI>interesting
<LI>I like the free exchange of info & idea's . Kids are a problem though.
<LI>It's great!
<LI>Slack off, or kill me.
<LI>The more the better!!!!  :)
<LI>It's great! The best way to aqquire pictures and stories, and coming in contact with others into the same things as you.
<LI>If parents were fullfilling their responsibility in bringing a child into the world, the children would not be given a chance to access it.
<LI>I just wish there were more women there
<LI>As modem speeds increase and technology improves, I look for real-time video and audio exchange to be the safe sex of 2000 and beyond.
<LI>I want more heavy stuff, easier to find
<LI>The problems with sex on the internet is not any worse than in the real world.
<LI>As with all net info, a usually valuable source of information
<LI>OK
<LI>Like it. Its adds a bit to my sex life.
<LI>Safe, fun, outlet for one to persue sexual interests
<LI>pretty coll, loss of inhabition, able to be whoever, whatever. 
<LI>ok
<LI>Usefull!
<LI>It's way over rated.  Time/Warner should not have never run that "CyberPorn" scare-tactic story.  It was a classic "yellow journalism" at its best.  But I suppose, SEX sells, so give the people what they want as long as they are stupid enough to pay for it.
<LI>Usefull!
<LI>Internet should be open for everything, including sex and porno.
<LI>I find the fact that the net provides a large open forum for everything EXCEPTIONAL. If any body gets the authority to censor sex related subjects then the next step is political censorship and the open forum and freedom to report on anything is DEAD.  KE
<LI>same as finding sex in bookstores, bars and clubs only safer and more private.
<LI>I think that the media has made a "tempest in a teapot" out of it.
<LI>It's a non-issue. The Internet is there for all to use--let them use it however they will.
<LI>I think sex should be available on the net for people who want it!
<LI>No better or worse than any other medium eg Mags.
<LI>Too many commercials
<LI>ÿToo much commercials
<LI>Good, but pour.
<LI>It educates me about Human Nature. Even the 'mee to!' posts.
<LI>The More... The Better... Sex is healthy and fun...
<LI>Simple fact finding.. basic questions.. curious
<LI>I don´t like censorship...
<LI>Hmmmmmmmmm..... :}
<LI>Cybersex is a whole new dimension and it has come to stay.
<LI>i think its good i mean if it weren't for the sex i wonldn't go on
<LI>I think that sex on the net is rather interesting it's a way for ppl to share ideas and fantasies, or find sexual gratification in some ways, it's not *real* it's a creative outlet for many :)
<LI>I think it's a good outlet.  People can ask anonymous questions and not feel embarassed.  A relatively healthy experience.  Give's one a chance to explore areas of sex safely with many different inputs from other areas.
<LI>why not
<LI>Mostly harmless in my opinion, but I'm concerned when I see references to practices such as pedophilia.  It's that aspect that will be the death of the net as we know it, as it's the only thing constantly referred to in the media.
<LI>I enjoy viewing the pictures and reading messages (usenet)
<LI>It has been a great way to exchange ideas with other people about sexuality and to help my wife and I find others like us who encourage us to feel sensual about ourselves.
<LI>It's an excuse for right-wing political activists to sponser censorship that restricts the first amendment.
<LI>I think people should be responsible for themselves, and if need be- for their children as well... If your children get into sexual material, don't blame the site that posted it..
<LI>It's great and anonym
<LI>Hey, I'm not complaining! :) the real hard core stuff is usually hidden away and sometimes tricky to find... you just have to know where (and when) to look... also, I maintain an extremely large adult page that is currently getting around 6000 hits a day;
<LI>Fascinating area on all sorts of levels
<LI>The Ineternet will die were it not for sex
<LI>what sex, I haven't found it yet
<LI>Private, in homes as opposed to goining to a store
<LI>

<LI>I really like what I've found and it brings much pleasure!
<LI>Overhyped and overrated.
<LI>I find some good scans and it is good to relieve some sexual tension over the verbal chat system and mail.  It is all in your mind how you construe what you see and how you interpret it!
<LI>Love it escept for the hyped pages that entice you for money
<LI>A keyword is sufficient to avoid children access. In my opinion my private behaviour is strictly mine and it does'nt be of political interest.
<LI>It's confusing!
<LI>It's out there, and it deserves to stay!
<LI>I think sex has been one of the largest single subjects that has contributed to people's interest and attraction to the Internet.  It is not the only big reason, but certainly one of them.  I think this is perfectly fine.
<LI>Sex on the net is not a problem for government but for individuals and parents.  Over-regulation of the net (e.g. making providers responsible for content) could result in closing the net.  This could happen because it is impossible to monitor activity while still permiting rapid transfer of information.
<LI>Open interchange of information is a halmark of democracy
<LI>It's a benign outlet for fantasies. I believe that a rating system should be created, and web browsers some sort of restriction mechanism.
<LI>I see nothing wrong with it as long as it is kept to people over the age of 21 and that pornography containing children is banned.
<LI>For those who want it or like it they should be able to find it.  No governmental entity should be permitted to interfere.
<LI>I love it and wish I could find more & experience more.
<LI>Again, I say Freedom of Speech, Press and all that. Parents should be responsible for thier kids activities. No government involvment, NOT because I dont believe in the gov, but rather because they will screw it all up and go overboard.
<LI>Its a great way to exchange media
<LI>I believe that the over all level of sexual awarness is being raised cause of the openness of sex on the internet.  anonymity lets people more honestly interact with others!
<LI>Like reading a magazine.
<LI>It has allowed me to fill sexual needs that I can't get now.
<LI>The best system so far IMO is the rating system, where a parent can set a filter that kids can't get into certain sites that are rated past that filter.
<LI>Oh Baby!!!!.....hehehe
<LI>Where is it?
<LI>Why not?  It doesn't appear to hurt anyone.  Censorship is a matter of personal opinion, parents should be responsible for their children.  I am a mature adult and should be able to choose if I wish to see it.  If you don't want it don't look for it!!
<LI>Sex has been around for a long time... Tell me, what's 'The world's OLDEST profession?'  Carpentry, right?  Wrong.  Sexual material will be wherever there are people who have sex.  Wake up, my governmental-type people!
<LI>It is the safest way to have sex. Even though you only masterbate with your partner... it is still safe..
<LI>Wish we could tell the real females from role playing guys
<LI>It's the best part of the Internet
<LI>There are a lot of sick people on the net...
<LI>I think that one of the basic tenets of the Internet lies in the free exchange of information.  Any censorship or regulation would greatly diminish the Internet concept as a whole.  Just as with television viewing and reading material, concerned parents should monitor the behavior of their children if they are worried about the dangers of sexual content on the net.  Rather than making the government responsible, these parents should be paying attention to their children's lives.
<LI>I feel that parents/legal guardians are the beginning of 'moral' teaching of children and really should be the majority.  It is not the responsibility of any government to raise children and decide what is best for the health of children.  I think that I will try to be open and honest with my children about sex and will not prevent them or discourage them from engaging in non-health threatening acts, sexual or otherwise.
<LI>I've never done it before.
<LI>I find it ironic that the same polititions who believe us responsible enough to carry automatic weapons do not believe us responsible enough to monitor our children and/or turn off our computers if we are offended.
<LI>I feel the internet should remain an uncensored medium and the passage of material, no matter what type, should be accepted.  
<LI>sex is fun. intnet link people together, providing a media
<LI>It's been blown way out of proportion. It's no easier to find here than it is at the newstand. I wish it were the way the media makes it sound, I'd be having a blast all the time!
<LI>seems rather silly. If that is what you look for, okay. Books and videos are certainly better for that sort of thing. Honestly, there is simply no substitute for the real thing. In truth, i would seek to make leasions with women where more real sexual encounters was a bona fide possibility. Like most males, what i want is more sex with new and attractive women. this usually happens through close encounters of a friendly kind. i am unmarried and sex with several women has been memorable, significant, in
ocent (!), and means of enjoying these new people in my life in a close and exciting way. i can't think of anything more unrelated or distant than "demeaning" or "degradation" to describe these intensely emotional and exciting moments. 
<LI>I think it's great to have access to certain material that you normally could not get in the real world.
<LI>I like the Net, I like Sex. Better find Sex on the net than aggression.
<LI>You left out "I married someone who I met on the Net" from!
<LI>Great celebrete pics...
<LI>I ENJOY IT
<LI>parents are to irresponsible and/or ignorant to take responsibility for their children's actions - why should the rest of us pay?  
<LI>more info. as swing clubs in all cities and local ph. numbers
<LI>No more available than other areas of society
<LI>I considered it as entertainment
<LI>Have always heard it was there...haven'y found that much yet but I am still new here.
<LI>More, please.
<LI>Great for the curious
<LI>Makes you an open-minede more curious person.
<LI>Its cool... Very Cool...
<LI>I like it.  It is a fairly benign outlet, for adults.  Much of the material is inappropriate for children, but monitoring of children is a part
<LI>I have, what i believe is an open access ro this material. I do though believe that there is some censorship. I want my c=access and believe it should be without 'big brother' mentality controls.
<LI>One Word - Overrated

<H2><CENTER><I>How would you deal with the issue of regulating sexual/offensive content?</I></CENTER></H2>

<LI>Make parents do their job...
<LI>should be regulated by parents
<LI>some sort of offline sign up before connecting
<LI>general education.  People should understand that the stories they read are STORIES alone.  This kind of education would also probably reduce the demand for porn. to begin with.  (ie people who read the internet porn and then get excited and rape or become corrupted would not get off on this stuff if they had some moral education like the type that would also teach them the difference between fantasy and reality.)  Since this type of moral education would be difficult to enforce in a free society, we h
ve to just concentrate on teaching the difference between fantasy and reality.  For the record, I explore internet porn as an intellectual curiosity in the depths of human depravity, and to help to come to terms with my own depraved instincts, which I wish to get rid of.
<LI>Create better security measures to block pages to children
<LI>the net should be open for non-violent individual pleasures

<LI>Have to be 18 to get your own account.
<LI>Keep the Kids away from adult stuff

<LI>User Pays
<LI>They have a law already 18 and over
<LI>Net should be open; could rate sites like movies
<LI>Shut down internet completely
<LI>Let people talk freely, that is BEST.
<LI>more sex!
<LI>It should be the user's responsbility to avoid sites they dislike
<LI>Regulate Access to the Internet, but keep the Net completely free
<LI>Estalblish a software lock-out capability so the net stays completely open, but parents can block what they don't want their kids to see.
<LI>Let parents be responsible for teaching thier children.  The goverment has no place pushing morality on people.  If parents did thier job then this wouldn't even be an issue.

<LI>Its a partents JOB to monitor childs exposure to material online
<LI>Allow local service providers to determine content; allow customers to choose service providers.
<LI>Kill the bigots, keep the net free for us who REALLY belong there
<LI>Individual Freedom is Paramount - The Net should be free!
<LI>The Net is self censoring - It is up to the end user to choose
<LI>Establish some sort of anon style registration service requiring the registree to certify age, but not really in favor of any restriction at all
<LI>secure those systems with a password
<LI>secure those systems with a password
<LI>As most individuals/groups who complain about the net and protecting children from "evil-sex" I say "take charge of your computer and exercise your parental responsibility to watch, monitor and control minor's use of computers - not just for the net but also for server chat areas etc.  If you give up your responsibility to government and/or others, don't complain about outside interference in your lives and your rights.

<LI>Open, but with mandatory warnings to parents.
<LI>There should be some multinational 'laws' conserning mostly childporn which should be totally prohibited. By the way neither i or any of my friends have ever seen those awful photos !
<LI>It is up to the parents to watch over their kids use and exposure of the internet. As for adults: If you don't like it, don't get involved with it, look at it, read it and etc. It is like a bad TV show, if you don't like it then dont watch it!!!
<LI>censorship should be parental
<LI>Parents should supervise their kids. Otherwise it should be completely open.
<LI>Parents schould monitor under age
<LI>Levels of access restricted by provider at customer's request
<LI>Give parents means to limit child's access
<LI>Require proof of age of some sort.
<LI>Parents should parent their children -- ease them into the world.  Growing up is growing up, you will constantly be challenged (to grow) by things that you haven't been exposed to before.  Slowly adjust to the real world.  Your mom is not a virgin, neither is the mother of YOUR children.  Sex happesn.  If you're lucky, you'll enjoy it.
<LI>develop software to block access for families
<LI>Block sex sites from minors.
<LI>Restrictions for computer of children against porn
<LI>let folks who care choose a monitored service, but don't kill unmoderated services
<LI>Software that restricts access (with rating system) like Surfwatch or whatever it's called

<LI>The net treats censorship as a fualt and routes around it
<LI>Educate parents on what kids can access on the net
<LI>It isn't a case of "The net *should* be open"; it IS and always will be no matter what silly laws are put in place.
<LI>Fuck off
<LI>let parents/others be responsable for selves
<LI>Open - Parents take care of children
<LI>Use a software that controls what minors see
<LI>If you can't buy it at your local adult book story - it should not be on the net. (ie kiddie porn, beastiality, shit eating, you get the idea...
<LI>Provide means for people who wish to limit different types of content on the web (could be sexual, political, etc).  The problem would be both the desirable and undesirable definition of the net (ie, it is open and exciting but unorganized and confusing to use).
<LI>fuck em' all, who cares what they say!
<LI>Shut down sick material like child and animal sex
<LI>Allow parents to "lock-out" sites (ie the V-chip for televisions).
<LI>Proof of Age required
<LI>Subscriber should have the ability to lock-out areas
