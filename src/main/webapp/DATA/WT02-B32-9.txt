As taught in the University of Reading, Food Science is a science-based course which seeks to provide an introduction to the important properties of food.  In particular, a student will learn about the chemistry, microbiology, nutritional value and sensory properties of selected foods, as well as the effects of different types of processing on those properties.  An element of specialisation is encouraged within the context of project work but, overall, a multi-disciplinary  approach is adopted so as to provide graduates with a background that is suitable for a whole range of careers.
<p>
Although various higher degrees involving research or more specialised training, e.g. Nutrition or Dietetics, are popular options for food scientists, many graduates prefer a career within the food industry.  Two schemes are run by the Department to help students in making the correct choice of career.  In the first place, the Department assists all students to obtain an eight-week placement in the food industry  during one of the long vacations, and this element of the course is compulsory.  However, students do have the option to spend a year in industry between the second and final years of the course, so that those seeking a career in research and development, quality assurance or production management have an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge within a working environment; placements within Europe are encouraged.
<p>
The course is of three years duration (excluding an optional year in industry), and is organised into  three parts with the subjects grouped into modules.  An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows:
<p>
<b>Part 1 (two terms) modules include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry
<li>Computing and Mathematics
<li>Cell Biochemistry
<li>Physical Aspects of Biological Systems 
<li>Molecular Biology
<li>Introductory Food Technology and Biotechnology
<li>Microbiology
</ul>

These modules in Part 1 are taken in common with students following the courses in Biotechnology, and Food Technology.


<b>Part 2 (three terms) modules include:</b>

<ul>
<li>Biological Chemistry
<li>Food Microbiology
<li>Food and Nutrition Chemistry 
<li>Statistics
<li>Instrumental Analysis
<li>Principles of Food Processing 
<li>Nutrition
</ul>

Plus additional optional subjects such as: Industrial Management and a language.
<p>
<b>Part 3 (4 terms) modules include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Food Chemistry
<li>Quality Assurance
<li>Sensory Analysis
<li>Nutrition
<li>Food Microbiology
<li>Project Work
</ul>

Plus additional optional subjects such as : Advanced Food Microbiology and Nutrition, Food Biotechnology and a language.
<p>
<b>Project work</b><br>
Each student undertakes a project in Part 3.  This consists of two stages: (I) the student prepares a critical review of an agreed topic and submits a report: (ii) the student carries out experimental work in one of the laboratories, under the supervision of a member of the academic staff, and writes a report on this work.  Both stages of the project are assessed.
<p>
<b>Teaching</b><br>
Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars.  These activities are supported by practical work in the science and processing laboratories.
<p>
<b>Assessment</b><br>
There is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1.  Students must pass in this to progress through the rest of the course.  In the event of failure at the first attempt each subject may be retaken once.  There is no formal examination at the end of Part 2.  Modules are assessed throughout Part 2.  Students who do not perform satisfactorily in these assessments may be required to take a written examination.  Modules are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course.  There is a formal written examination at the end of the course.  The class of degree awarded to each student will be based on consideration of the results of the modular assessments in Parts 2 and 3, the results of the final examination and the assessment of the student’s performance in the project.
<p>
<b>Sponsorship and prizes</b><br>
A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking  this course.  This may commence at the start of  the course or at a later stage.  There are a number of prizes awarded to students who perform well in different aspects of the course.  
<p>
<b>Entry requirements</b><br>
Two, preferably three, A-level passes in science subjects or mathematics, or AS equivalents, and our standard offer is for grades CDD.  Good attainments in other courses, such as International Baccalaureate, BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered.
<p>
<b>Career opportunities</b><br>
Over one million people are employed in food and drink manufacture, distribution and sales.  A recent survey has shown that career opportunities for graduates in that industry, both in terms of salary and promotion prospects, are among the best of all professional groups.  Opportunities arise in the manufacturing sector in research and development, production management, quality assurance, buying, marketing and sales.  Many of the large retail companies employ our graduates to liaise with suppliers on the quality of their products, the conditions under which they are produced and in the development of new products.  Other opportunities occur in government research establishments, with local authorities and in teaching.  Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate studies here at Reading or in other UK or overseas Universities.
<p>
<b>Other courses</b><br>
The Department offers undergraduate courses in Biotechnology ( 4 yrs), Chemistry and Food Science (3 yrs), Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing (4 yrs), Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing (3 yrs) and in Food Technology (4 yrs).  It also offers taught MSc courses in Food and Agricultural Biotechnology, Food Science and Food Technology as well as research courses leading to MPhil and PhD degrees. <p>
