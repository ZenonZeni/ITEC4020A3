<h1>Two References on Coca-Leaf Chewing </h1>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> A. Barnett, R. Hawks, and R. Resnick. &quot;Cocaine
Pharmacokinetics in Humans.&quot; </p>

<p> The Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 3 (1981) 353-366. </p>

<p> &quot;Therefore, on the basis of this new information that
has come as a result of technological development we can conclude
with a pratical observation. The size of the quid of coca leaves
that can be comfortably accomodated by a person is such that it
is unlikely that coca chewing, as practiced for centuries in
places like Macchu Piccu, presents the dangers that may result
from the modern forms of recreational use.&quot; </p>

<p> Particularly interesting about this article is that the
report came out of the Division of Research of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p> A. Weil. &quot;The Therapeutic Value of Coca in Contemporary
Medicine.&quot; </p>

<p> The Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 3 (1981) 367-376. </p>

<p> &quot;I have lived among coca-using Indians of the Andes and
the Amazon basin in Columbia and Peru and have not seen any signs
of physical deterioration attributable to the leaf. I have never
seen an instance of coca toxicity. Nor have I observed
physiological or psychological dependence on coca. Even life-long
chewers seem able to get the effect they want from the same dose
over time; there is no development of tolerance and certainly no
withdrawal syndrome upon sudden discontinuance of use.&quot; </p>
