<h2><i>Your Guide to The Benefits of Vulvar Self Examination</i>
</h2><hr>
<h2>Important?<br>
Yes, But Taken For Granted</h2>
The "VULVA" refers to the external female genital organs...that very special area of a woman's body so vital to healthy female identity and sexual function.<p>
Yet...how often do most women correctly examine the vulva? Would you know the right way to check the vulva...what to look for? Could you find the early signs of important changes which mean the start of serious infection or even cancer of the vulva?<p>
If you're not in the habit of doing vulvas self exams...or if you're not sure of the importance or the right way to do self exams...Find out how a simple self exam of the vulva can alert you to a Problem before serious infection develops...before cancer develops.<p>
<img src="vse4.gif"><br>
Unfortunately, physicians are seeing an increasing number of women with cancer (and precancerous conditions) of the vulva in all age groups, but especially in younger women. Infectious diseases of the vulva (especially viral infections such as genital warts and herpes) are also increasing.<p>
Genital warts (sometimes called "condyloma accuminata") will cause an estimated 1 million women to seek medical attention this year. Most women who discover genital warts DO NOT have cancer. However, the same virus that causes genital warts (human papilloma virus) has been linked to cancer of the female genitals.<p><hr>
<h2>Why Vulvar Self Exams?<br>
The Importance of Early Detection</h2>
Women may have early infections or precancerous growths, but may not be aware of changes in the vulva until the disease becomes more advanced. As you would expect, more serious cases require more extensive treatment...which could even mean a major loss of vulvar tissue to survive.<p>
Yet, if caught early, your physician can better treat as well as prevent the spread of infection or growths on the vulva. The key is early detection.<p>
A simple self exam of the vulva is the most important habit you can start now to help you notice important changes in the vulva... changes which need to be reported and discussed with your physician.<p><hr>
<h2>Who Should Perform VSE?</h2>
All women who are sexually active...and even women who are not sexually active but are over 18 years old.<p><hr>
<h2>How Often Should VSE Be Performed?</h2>
Once a month, just as recommended for breast self exams; or any time you have symptoms related to the vulva. Women with any history of vulvar disease are encouraged to perform vulvar self exams more often. (Vulvar self exams are best performed between menstrual periods.)<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: MOST CHANGES OR NEW GROWTHS ON THE VULVA WILL NOT BE CANCEROUS...</b>and will need only minor checking ant treatment. But, you should report all changes to your physician to determine the best care at the first sign of a problem.<p><hr>
<h2>How to Perform VSE...<br> Where To Look</h2>
<img src="vse3.gif"><br>
<b>POSITION.</b> Find a comfortable, well-lighted place to sit such as a bed or a carpet. Hold a mirror in one hand. Then, use the other hand to separate and expose the parts of the vulva surrounding the opening of the vagina. Once you have a good viewing position, examine the main parts of the vulva as follows:<br><ol>

<li>Check the "mons pubis" (the area above the vagina around the pubic bone where the pubic hair is located). Look carefully for any bumps, warts, ulcers, or changes in skin color (pigmentation, especially newly developed white, red, or dark areas). Then, use the finger tips to check any visible change and to sense any bump just below the surface you might feel but not see.

<li>Next, check the "clitoris" and surrounding area (directly above the vagina) by looking and by touch.

<li>Next, examine the Labia minora: (the smaller folds of skin just to the right and left of the vaginal opening). Look and touch by holding the skin between thumb and ringers.

<li>Then look closely at the "labia majora" (the larger folds of skin just next to the labia minora). Examine both right and left just as you did the labia minora.

<li>Move down to the "perineum" (the area between the vagina and the anus). Check thoroughly.

<li>Finally, examine the area surrounding the anal opening...as before by looking and by touch.</ol><p>

<b>REMEMBER THE BASIC RULE: </b>Vulvar diseases are most easily, safely, and successfully treated when discovered early. Now you know...and now you have yet another good way to help protect your own health...the monthly vulvar self examination...a good habit to start today.<p><hr>
<h2>What To Look For</h2>

If you find any new growths or changes,
report them to your physician as soon as
possible. Some examples include:<br><ul>

<li> A new mole, wart, or growth of any kind.
<li> New areas of Pigmentation" (skin color) especially newly developed white, red, or dark skin areas.
<li> Ulcers or sores, except for any minor injury with a known cause.
<li>Areas of continuing pain, inflammation, or itching.</ul><p><hr>
