<LI>During the fourth quarter, the municipal bond market rallied.  This was fueled primarily by the fall presidential and congressional elections, which produced no surprises and by the economy, which continued to show signs of slower growth and moderate inflation.
<LI>Yields along the municipal money market yield curve (maturities up to 1 year) declined by 10-15 basis points in the short end of the curve and by 25-30 basis points in the 1-year area.  Yields within the variable rate sector of the municipal market remained relatively unchanged throughout the majority of the fourth quarter.
<LI>During the fourth quarter, the Fund's assets increased by $60 million.  Its yield increased 19 basis points, while its average maturity decreased by 21 days to 54 days.
