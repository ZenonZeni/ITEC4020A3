<i>Dr Saunders is a consultant physician at Nevill Hall Hospital in
Gwent, and is an Honorary Fellow at the Centre for Philosophy and
Health Care at University College, Swansea. This paper is a slightly
shortened version of his acclaimed seminar "Do not resuscitate orders
- for whom?" at the 10th International Conference of Right to Die
Societies in Bath in 1994. </i>

<P>[EXTRACT:]Techniques for reversing cardiac arrest (Cardio-Pulmonary
Resuscitation - CPR) developed 35 years ago to prevent sudden
unexpected death. More widespread use led to lower success rates
and inappropriate use. The inappropriate "crash call" looms large in
British hospital folklore. A junior nurse finds an apparently dead patient
and puts out a call. The team rushes to the ward, scattering all in
their path. After prolonged efforts a pulse is reestablished only to
discover that the patient is demented with metastatic carcinoma. No-
one's interests have been served. The patient's last hours are an
undignified trauma; the relatives are distressed; the doctors irritated
and disillusioned and the junior nurses probably disciplined by
unimaginative seniors for their actions.
<BR>UK surveys suggest that about 25% of CPR attempts may be
"inappropriate." British practice was formerly characterized by either an
absence of policies or unwritten, covert policies. Even so, there did
seem to be a fear that too much CPR was occurring. A Lancet
editorial in 1982 was actually entitled "Cardiac resuscitation in hospital:
more restraint needed?" A more recent editorial in the British Medical
Journal was frankly paternalistic: "In Britain, sound unhurried clinical
judgement, sympathy, understanding and mutual trust, rather than
abstract principles and printed policy statements have in general stood
patients in good stead.... Better than anyone else the consultant and
his team know the nature of the patient's disease or diseases and
the likelihood of responding to treatment. Quality of life is relative and
should be assessed in relation to the age, state of health and
personal aptitudes and interests of each individual patient."
In reality, judgements were often simply not made or were delegated
to junior staff. The decision was sometimes left to some unfortunate
nurse to make on the spur of the moment. The British approach was
complacent.
<BR>This complacency was punctured by the report of the
Parliamentary Commissioner or Ombudsman in 1991. He drew
attention to the case of a woman of 88 admitted to hospital with
pneumonia. The patient was designated not for resuscitation. The
patient's son discovered and complained. The Ombudsman commented
that he "found surprising the novelty of establishing a written
resuscitation policy." After discussion by a parliamentary committee, the
government's Chief Medical Officer wrote to all consultants pointing out
their responsibilities. Official bodies responded with guidelines and
policy recommendations.
<BR>Since the alternative to CPR is death, it is easy to assume that
CPR can do no harm. The assumption is wrong. Harm may result to
the patient, to the family, to health carers and to society. Clear
policies are therefore needed in institutions such as hospitals and
nursing homes, to determine "do not resuscitate" (DNR) orders.
Many have suggested that a value judgement can be avoided by
withholding CPR from those in whom it simply will not work - so
called physiological futility. I do not believe this is true. Even five
minutes more life might be valued in some (perhaps rather fantastic)
scenarios. Many will find it repugnant to give CPR to someone in the
persistent vegetative state. Yet the decision is not value free. It is
possible that such a life may be greatly valued, that such an
individual may still be the focus for someone's love and concern and
that an individual may have wanted continuing biological life as long
as they could continue such a role. To decline CPR is to deny such
possibilities. A few hours extra may enable affairs to be ordered,
goodbyes to be made.
<BR>The BMA/RCN guidelines state: "It is appropriate to consider a
DNR decision... where the patient's condition indicates that effective
CPR is unlikely to be successful.... When the basis for a DNR order
is the absence of any likely benefit, discussion with the patient, or
others close to the patients, should aim at securing an understanding
and acceptance of the clinical decision that has been reached."
<BR>Autonomy is not enhanced where one choice offers no
reasonable prospect of a particular outcome. Doctors do need more
education in prognosis. It has been shown that cancer or AIDS are
perceived to be terminal, while equally terminal conditions such as
cirrhosis or cardiac failure are not. CPR is then inappropriately offered
to the latter and, quite correctly, not to the former. Both doctors and
nurses in the UK and the US have an over-optimistic view of a
patient's chances of surviving CPR. Resuscitation training programmes
should routinely include data on survival from CPR in differing
circumstances.
<BR>Such data need to be distinguished from quality-of-life
considerations. There is extreme variability in such estimates by health
care professionals. The disabled value a quality of life that many
healthy people might consider unacceptable: in a study of 21 patients
with spinal injuries requiring ventilation, for example, only one wished
to be allowed to die.
