<B><A HREF = "fs101.html">Agriculture </A>is 
vulnerable to climate variability and weather extremes.  </B>In general, the most 
destructive climate-related event is drought.  For example, droughts associated with the 
major 1982-84 El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) anomaly cut Australia's wheat 
harvest in half, caused distress to some 14 million people in Brazil's Northeast, and cost 
southern Africa almost US$1 billion. Too much rainfall, on the other hand, can also wreak 
havoc. It can wash out crops, make fields unworkable, and prevent access to remote areas.  
In addition, high humidity can encourage plant diseases and ruin stored food, frosts can 
harm young plants and fruit before they can be harvested, and strong winds and severe 
storms can damage standing crops and contribute to flooding.<P>
<B>The risk of extreme weather varies over time and from region to region.  
</B>Most agricultural systems can cope with a reasonable range of weather conditions, 
but destructive weather occurs in all climates.  For example, a region with a rainy climate 
may face a small probability in any given year that rainfall will be less than the minimum 
required for a particular crop.  The seasonal distribution of rainfall can be just as critical as 
the year-to-year variation:  an extended dry spell when crops are flowering may be more 
detrimental than a drought just before the harvest.  In much of the world, periods of 
drought or flood have been associated with large-scale fluctuations that occur every few 
years in the global circulation of the atmosphere, such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation.  
In most of Africa, rainfall in the 1950s and 1960s was fairly plentiful and regular - but 
variability doubled in the 1970s and 1980s in some regions.  By altering temperature and 
precipitation patterns, greenhouse gas-induced climate change may create new climate 
conditions that in many regions would currently be considered extreme.<P>
<B>Climatic conditions often interact with socio-economic conditions to undermine 
food security.</B>  Climate variability tends to have the greatest impact on people who 
are landless, poor, or isolated.  Changes in socio-economic conditions can lead to dramatic 
changes in food security. Disadvantageous terms of trade, poor infrastructure, and armed 
conflict also make it more difficult for people to cope with the effects of climatic extremes.  
For example, while food security would anyway have been a problem in Sudan during the 
severe drought of the 1980s and 1990s, economic recession and civil strife were major 
causes of the widespread famine.  In China, on the other hand, land reform and economic 
growth during the same period substantially reduced food poverty.<P>
<B>Some one billion people may be at risk of hunger, although estimates vary 
widely. </B>   The diagram below shows relative food security by country, based on such 
social indicators as per capita food production, per capita GNP, and child/infant mortality 
rates.  Countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Mali, and Haiti are the least food-secure, in 
marked contrast to developed countries, the newly industrialising countries of Southeast 
Asia, and most of Latin America.  Such chronic food insecurity can evolve into a food 
crisis or, if not controlled, a famine.  In general, a 30% decrease in the production of a 
nation's staple food, or a drop in annual food supplies below 150 kg per capita, greatly 
increases the risk of famine, since internal redistribution can no longer solve the problem. 
The key cause of hardship is the persistence of a food shortage over a number of years.  In 
North Kordofan, Sudan, for example, accumulated wealth declined by 80% during 
1983-1985 and hardly recovered in the following three years. Increasingly, it seems that 
many of Africa's poor are unable to recover fully from one crisis before the next one is 
upon them.<P>
<B>Effective policies can minimise the climate's impact on food security.</B>  
Thanks to dramatic improvements in our ability to forecast and monitor extreme events 
and food security (particularly the risk of famine), the prospects for reliable and timely 
warnings are quite promising.  But even the best forecasts of climate variability will still 
require effective "hazard management" policies.  Key policies include maintaining the 
productivity of the land and other agricultural assets, diversifying income sources to 
prevent total dependence on one or two crops, setting aside strategic reserves in good 
years, and motivating farmers with good market prices and other production incentives.  
When such strategies fail, the next step is "crisis containment", including such measures as 
consuming assets needed for future production (female livestock for example).  If disaster 
looms despite such efforts, people will be forced to cut back dramatically on eating, sell 
their possessions, and migrate.  Unfortunately, disaster relief efforts in developing 
countries have not been encouraging.  Civil strife, as in Somalia, or the sheer size of the 
imminent disaster, as in Bangladesh after its 1991 cyclone, too often render emergency 
services ineffective.<P>
<B>Strategies for coping with climatic extremes may be relevant to future strategies 
for adapting to climate change.</B>  Ongoing efforts to deal with persistent climatic 
trends resulting from other factors besides greenhouse gas emissions (such as 
desertification caused by overgrazing) suggest a range of practical options.  In fact, 
climate change researchers often use the current impacts of today's climate extremes as 
analogues of future possibilities. Improving our ability to adapt to theagricultural impacts 
of natural climate variability, therefore, will contribute to our ability to secure future 
global food supplies under conditions of climate change.<P>
