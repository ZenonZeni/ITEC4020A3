<H3>Welcome to </H3>

<H3>Looking Around</H3>

<P>
<I>A contemporary assessment of landcover disturbance for the
Australian Continent</I> 
<P>
by Dean Graetz, Murray Wilson and Susan Campbell,
<P>
CSIRO Earth Observation Centre,
<P>
Australia.<HR>

<P>
This electronic document reports a scientific assessment of the
current state of the landcover of the Australian continent undertaken
by CSIRO. Through this study, we wanted to establish a continental
picture of the extent and severity of landcover disturbance, the
changes in the vegetation and soils, as of the beginning of this
decade.
<P>
We undertook this study to provide a contemporary understanding
and to relate the findings to the continuing problem of the loss
of biodiversity. We publish the findings in this format to make
them accessible to all who are interested.
<P>
How you proceed through this publication is entirely up to you.
<P>
We want to communicate to you four messages:
<UL>
<LI>Why we studied landcover disturbance for the continent
<LI>How we did it;
<LI>What we found;
<LI>What it all means.
</UL>

<P>
We tell this story in two different formats, and in one of these
formats, this compact disk, we tell the story in two different
ways.
<P>
Our story is told in printed format as a report entitled
<P>
<B>'Landcover disturbance over the Australian continent: A contemporary
assessment'.</B> 
<P>
by R.D. Graetz, M.A. Wilson and S.K. Campbell, 1995.
<P>
Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 7.
<P>
A copy of the printed report can be obtained from the <A HREF="dest.htm">Biodiversity Unit of DEST</A>.
<P>
<B>When you see highlighted text (as in the last sentence), you
may click on it to link to further or related information on the
CDROM.</B><HR>

<P>
<B>NB: Throughout this report you may click on small pictures
like this to see a larger version. </B><HR>

<P>
The second format of our story is the one you are using now.
<P>
<B>With an electronic document such as this you may navigate at
will through the sections using the &quot;go forward&quot; or
&quot;go back&quot; facilities of your browsing software, and
by clicking on highlighted words or phrases. Additionally you
may use other features of your browsing software to, for example,
print a section of interest.</B> 
<P>
<B>At the bottom of each electronic page you will see three buttons.
One button returns you to the &quot;Contents&quot; page, the other
two enable you to step forwards or backwards through the whole
document just as you would with a paper book.</B> 
<P>
Apart from the electronic document, the CDROM version contains
copies of the actual data used to arrive at our conclusions. This
summary of the project is a critical component of the scientific
culture. Science is a process of testable inquiry and it is important
that the findings of a research project are available for scrutiny
by others.
<P>
However, this data-only version of the story is unlikely to interest
the majority of readers. For more information about the datasets
provided on the CDROM refer to the <A HREF="../readme.txt">general readme file</A>
and the <A HREF="../datasets/readme.txt">readme file in the datasets directory</A>.
<P>
The complete, and therefore longest way, is the narrative path
by which the project will unfold in a logical sequence. At the
end, you will have the best overview of what we did, why we did
it, what we found, and what it all means.
<P>
However, with this format of electronic document, the reader is
free to move to whatever section desired.<HR>

<P>
Before you continue with Looking Around, we raise a number of
points.
<P>
Whatever path you take through this electronic publication, you
are reading a document prepared by scientists. This is a scientific
document prepared and reviewed in the traditions of applied scientific
research - to provide the best answers possible to the significant
questions of our time.
<P>
The second point is that it is not common for scientific research
to be reported in a widely accessible format like compact disk.
It is not common, but it is not impossible to do so. Dramatic
changes in technology over the last three years now facilitate
communication between all sectors of society that was previously
not possible. We believe that all the components of this story,
objectives, methods and results, may be of interest to a wide
audience. Therefore, we have embraced the technologies necessary
to tell the story of this project in this enduring format.
<P>
Lastly, the style in which we write is personal and direct and
in contrast to the majority of science writing. This contrast
is not because scientists are all dull and boring, without passion
and character. Far from it. Scientists nearly always write for
other scientists: both parties know and understand the personal
commitment to scientific research and the agonies and ecstasies
in conducting it so they concentrate on only the objective details.
<P>
In this publication, we are communicating with non-scientists
(we think) so we have included details of the strengths and weaknesses
of the methods that were used and the difficulties that were encountered.
<P>
Moreover, we write in a personal and direct style because we want
you to be aware of how important we think this issue is, and how
good or bad a job we have made of the study.
<P>
Does a passion for your subject diminish the objectivity with
which you can conduct research? It can; but we believe it hasn't.
If you are interested in thinking about this further, then read
the small section called <A HREF="end.htm">A Personal Note </A>.
<P>
Finally, this document contains many images. They are not included
just for cosmetic reasons. Each image reinforces points that were
made in the text. Consider each image carefully and make a systematic
effort to interpret what you see. If you do this, we are certain
it will increase your enjoyment of this electronic document.
