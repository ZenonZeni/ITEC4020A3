	<CENTER><H2>NEW PRIMATE SPECIES DISCOVERED IN BRAZIL</H2>
	<H3>Marmoset More Proof Of Tropics' Biological Riches   </H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
	Washington, D.C. -- The discovery of a new species of marmoset in South America's tropical rain forest was announced recently by the scientific community in Brazil.
<P>
	"Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International and chairman of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission, Primate Specialist Group.  "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as our closest relatives, the primates."  
 
	The new species is named Callithrix saterei, for a group of Indians indigenous to the central Brazilian Amazon area where the marmoset was discovered.  The small, squirrel-sized primate is distinct from its closest relatives, with physical traits such as unpigmented skin on the face and ears, and golden orange color.
<P>
	Its description, written by Jos‚ de Sousa Silva J£nior and Maur¡cio de Almeida Noronha, will soon be published in the Brazilian scientific journal Goeldiana.
 
	Six new species of primates have been discovered in Brazil since 1990, bringing the total number of primate species in Brazil to 75, the highest in the world, more than double Indonesia, Madagascar or Zaire.  Although wild primates occur in 92 countries, these four countries account for nearly 70 percent of all 250 primates species worldwide, with Brazil alone accounting for almost 30 percent.
<P>
	Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to protect global biodiversity, focusing on ecological hotspots in more than 21 countries on four continents.
