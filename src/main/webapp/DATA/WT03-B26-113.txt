<H3>Clearing </H3>
<HR>

<P>
This type of landcover disturbance defines the ILZ. We summarise
our findings for the continent under the following four headings
<P>
Aggregate Area
<P>
Within the ILZ, we assessed that 1,547,863 km2, or 51.9% of the
area was either cleared or thinned.
<P>
This in turn translates to approximately 20% of the whole continent.

of clearing disturbance aggregated for the Intensive landuse Zone
(ILZ) and for the continent.

<HR>

<P>
How good is this estimate?
<P>
There is no single dataset to test the validity of this estimate.
There were however two national estimates that allow us to examine
its plausibility.
<P>
The first of these is the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
estimates for the total area of crops and pastures in 1990; <A HREF="refs.htm">ABS (1994)</A>.
The ABS figure is 475, 000 km2; roughly one third of the figure
derived in this study. However, the areas reported by the ABS
have two important qualifications: they do not equate to the total
area cleared, and the figures were derived by survey sampling
not census sampling as in this study. The figure published by
the ABS is the area used for crops in that year. In cereal cropping
areas with a 2-3 year crop rotation, it suggests that the total
area cleared for cropping may be three times that used in any
one year. Since the ABS reports that the area of crops peaked
at approximately 220, 000 km2 in 1983-84, then the total area
cleared for cropping alone may be 660, 000 km2.
<P>
The area cleared for the establishment of pastures was more difficult
to separately identify. Undoubtedly, in some agricultural areas
there is a reciprocal substitution of pasture and crop depending
on commodity prices. Nonetheless, there has been an expansion
of clearing for the establishment of sown pastures alone. This
clearing and establishment have been most marked in northern NSW,
and especially Queensland. Here the second set of figures adds
plausibility to the total figure derived in this study.
<P>
The estimates of landcover change published by <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>
were based on the manual interpretation of satellite data acquired
a decade ago. That survey recorded extensive thinning as well
as clearing of woodlands for the establishment or enhancement
of pastures. The aggregate figures produced by the AUSLIG survey
suggest that in the last 200 years, there has been a net increase
by thinning of 400, 000 km2 of open woodlands, and by clearing,
a net increase in grassland and pasture areas of 710, 000 km2.
The sum of these two AUSLIG estimates is markedly less than the
area of thinning and clearing that we measured, indicating an
alarming increase of those activities over the last decade.
<P>
No doubt there were uncertainties associated with both estimates
but it is unlikely that the agreement between the two census assessments
based on satellite data was fortuitous.<HR>

<H4>Distribution </H4>

<P>
Where is the clearing?
<P>
The distribution of the ILZ and the extent of clearing and thinning
within it, is shown in this ILZ disturbance image<B>. </B><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="fig3_1"></A><A HREF="reptill/cover3c.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/cover3c.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
<I>The continental distribution of disturbance by clearing. The
classes and colour codes are: uncleared (green); thinned (brown);
cleared (white); indeterminate (blue); lakes (black).</I><HR>

<P>
Clearing and thinning extends across the southern areas of the
continent, including the central area of Tasmania, and northwards
through Central Queensland. The most southerly areas of clearing
were associated with cereal cropping and improved pastures; that
in northern NSW and Central Queensland was mostly for the establishment
of pastures.
<P>
How to interpret the four disturbance classes displayed in this
image?
<P>
The three key classes are uncleared, thinned and cleared. These
were allocated as progressive steps from uncleared, where the
vegetation canopy was intact, to cleared, where the spectral signature
of the intact canopy was replaced by that of understorey. The
thinned class was an intermediate step within these two extremes
based solely on spectral signature; it was not primarily based
on the measurements of the degree of thinning, such as tree densities,
but the two are closely related. The decision rules for the allocation
of each pixel in this image to one of these three classes were
formulated after exacting expert interpretation, and consistently
applied. The image depicts our assessment of the extent and location
of vegetation disturbance by clearing as of approximately 1990.
<P>
The indeterminate class displayed in the<B> </B>image illustrates
the landcover types within the ILZ for which an assessment of
clearing disturbance could not be made.
<P>
The largest area was in the Northern Territory where localised
clearing, almost entirely for pastures, could be detected but
not reliably mapped. The areas involved, including the Ord River
irrigation development, were trivial compared with the clearing
in southern Australia.
<P>
The indeterminate areas outside the Northern Territory were the
landcover types without a woody overstorey, the grasslands, for
which the classification of clearing was inappropriate.
<P>
This is not to say that these landcover types are undisturbed.
Cultivation was detectable within the cleared grasslands (xG4)
on the west coast of Tasmania and within the most mesic grasslands
of the other States and Territories; see, for example, <A HREF="reptill/tasmania.gif">TASMANIA</A>.
The grasslands at the drier edges of the ILZ (xG3, xG2) are also
disturbed, principally by grazing.
<P>
This display of the clearing data-set also illustrates the nature
and strength of the uncertainties associated with the assessments
reported in this document. The error here is misclassification:
uncleared was classified as thinned or cleared, and the converse.
As explained earlier, because of the intrinsic nature of the source
satellite data-set and the fallibility of the expert process,
such errors can never be eliminated.
<P>
Rather, in this project, the uncertainty has been managed by minimising
and systematising the error by consistently biasing it in one
direction. With a focus on the uncleared class, a bias towards
the error of commission was preferred. That is, the uncleared
class decision rules were set to optimistic values, to err toward
a high value. Generally we achieved that so that the actual undisturbed
areas with the ILZ were less that the values reported here.
<P>
Errors of commission concerning the uncleared class are difficult
to demonstrate in the image. However, the converse, error of omission
where uncleared vegetation was labelled as thinned or cleared
can be illustrated.
<P>
Along the clearing boundaries of parts of Western Australia, South
Australia, Tasmania and northern Queensland, there are areas labelled
as cleared that are not. We encourage you to examine the images
of these areas provided in <A HREF="ausindex.htm">Exploring Your Country</A>.
In particular, you will find the images of <A HREF="map/townsvil.gif">TOWNSVILLE</A>,
<A HREF="map/clermont.gif">CLERMONT</A>, <A HREF="map/charlevi.gif">CHARLEVILLE</A>,
<A HREF="map/bourke.gif">BOURKE</A>, <A HREF="map/bronhill.gif">BROKEN HILL</A>,
<A HREF="map/adelaid.gif">ADELAIDE</A>, <A HREF="map/paugusta.gif">PORT AUGUSTA</A>,
<A HREF="map/tasmanll.gif">TASMANIA</A>, <A HREF="map/esperanc.gif">ESPERANCE</A>,
<A HREF="map/albany.gif">ALBANY</A>, <A HREF="map/perth.gif">PERTH</A>
and <A HREF="map/meekatha.gif">MEEKATHARRA</A> are of particular
interest.
<P>
This error could not be avoided, only minimised. There are two
principal sources of this error: problems intrinsic to the satellite
dataset, and limitations to separating clearing from significant
disturbance by grazing. Nevertheless, the nature and size of these
errors were small compared with the information content of this
dataset that is summarised in the remainder of this section.<HR>

<H4>Landcover Type </H4>

<P>
Is the clearing and thinning evenly distributed across all landcover
types?
<P>
Considering the entire ILZ, the distribution of disturbance by
clearing between landcover types is summarised in Table 6. A simple
index of Loss (thinned and cleared) was also calculated reflecting
the view that for the process of biotic erosion, there is little
difference between thinned and cleared.<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="table6"></A>Table 6</B>: A summary of the relative
distribution (%) of clearing within each landcover type. The grasslands
(xG) and low shrublands (xZ2) were excluded. The index Loss was
the sum of the cleared and thinned classes.

<P>
Overall the average proportion of a landcover type that was cleared
or thinned (Loss) was 47% with values ranging between 0-99%.

As might be expected, the highest Loss values are for the smallest

landcover type (eS2) account for 45% of the total area.</I> <HR>

<P>
By far the largest clearing has taken place in the open eucalypt
forests (eM2), followed by the open eucalypt shrublands (eS2),
forests (eTML3), sparse forests (eM1) and so forth. The area cleared
within the first two landcover types accounts for 45% of the total
area cleared.<HR>

<H4>Tenure </H4>

<P>
Tenure is a land management tool; a type of landuse licence issued
by state governments. Landuse activities are prescribed and proscribed
by certain tenures, and clearing is one such activity. Thus, the
distribution of the landcover disturbance classes between various
tenure types reflects the management of clearing by state governments.
All six tenure types defined in <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>
are represented within the ILZ and their relative sizes are illustrated
by the following tenure pie chart. <HR>

Tenure type 1 (Freehold, Mining leasehold) and type 2 (Pastoral

ILZ.
<P>
What is the proportional area of each tenure type that is either
cleared or thinned?
<P>
The relative size of the area that was thinned and cleared relative
to the total area of that tenure type is displayed as the following
tenure-clearing pie chart. For tenure type 1 (Freehold, Mining),
this proportion was high (74%) and less so for tenure type 2 (35%)
the Pastoral (and Defence) tenures.<HR>

<P>
In absolute terms, these are the two tenures that contain the
cleared and thinned landcovers as would be expected. All of agriculture,
a replacement landuse, is held under Freehold tenure while most
pastoral activity, a harvesting landuse, is conducted mostly under
Pastoral tenure with some under Freehold.
<P>
Can we use this finding to check on the overall validity of our
assessment of clearing and thinning?
<P>
The tenure-clearing pie chart revealed that there was a small
occurrence of cleared and thinned classes within the tenure types
that offer high protection against clearing; types 4, 5 and 6.
Type 6 is dedicated conservation reserve. These occurrences are
obviously a misclassification and an error of omission; uncleared
landcover classified as cleared.<HR>

<P>
In relative terms within each tenure type the error of omission
was large; up to 40% for tenure type 5 (Unused). However, in absolute
terms, it is less damaging. If we assume that there should be
no clearing at all in tenure types 3 to 6, then the proportion
of misclassified pixels was 108454 from a total of 549014; an
omission error rate of 20%.
<P>
This is a worst case error analysis which if continentally applicable,
reduces the total area thinned and cleared from 1, 550, 000 km2
to 1, 240, 000 km2.
<P>
We are confident that the error detected by this check was not
continentally applicable but we are unable to substantiate this
opinion. Nevertheless, this calculation is a measure of the uncertainty
associated with all aggregate measurements reported in this project.
