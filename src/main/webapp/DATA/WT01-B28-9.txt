<h1>Historical Research on Drug Policy </h1>

<p>The history of our drug policy is one of the more fascinating
chapters in the development of America as we are today. This
section will continue to grow and I invite everyone to make
submissions of their favorite historical documents on the
subject. By the way, folks, in case anyone asks, we are firmly
committed to publishing all of the historical information,
regardless of which side it may favor. </p>
