<h1>Cannabis as an Adjunctive Treatment for AIDS Related Illness.
</h1>

<p><b>By Tod Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

</p>

<p>Ken D. is in a protracted war. For the last nine years this
thirty eight year old married mainframe computer programmer with
a degree in accounting has fought the human immunodefficiency
virus in his body one skirmish, one battle at a time. He is a
long term survivor, beating the odds. A wiry intelligent man with
a neatly trimmed beard to hide the lesions of Kaposi's Sarcoma,
KS, a form of cancer with many small colonies growing slowly in
his skin and mouth with itching and discolored patches. His beard
also protects from irritating the inflammation of the skin
erupting from the side effects of medications.<br>
</p>

<p>Ken also holds a fungal pneumonia at bay. Pneumocystis
Carinii, a fungus that is found most everywhere, including normal
healthy lungs without causing symptoms, hecomes invasive and
toxic when the immune system is weakened. This is one of many
opportunistic infectious diseases taking advantage of a weakened
immune system. <br>
</p>

<p>He wishes he could work but the terms of his disability status
would cost him his benefits that see him through his periods of
immobilization. The chemotherapies are specific poisons to target
specific enzyme systems of the cancer cells or the fungus but are
debilitating to the body. A major symptom is loss of appetite.
Anorexia is a major threat to the body when fighting these
invaders. In order to summon the strength to stimulate the immune
system to resist, there must be nourishment. Otherwise, the body
must consume itself to support the immune system. Ths loss of
appetite, and thus weight, represents a major threat to survival.
The weakness from inadequate nutrition leads to immobilization,
stasis, and other complications. <br>
</p>

<p>Many of the therapeutic agents cause anorexia as a side
effect, further suppressing an already poor appetite. <br>
</p>

<p>Ken had used cannabis 20 years but only occasionally in social
situations. Since then, he has come to rely on using it daily to
maintain his appetite while taking the various chemotherapeutic
drugs. Not one to run from a fight, he has been a &quot;guinea
pig&quot; in many therapeutic research trials that have had
varying success in beating back the cancer or the fungal
infections.<br>
</p>

<p>Despite the sensitivity of his lungs from the PCP infection
that caused him to be hospitalized three years ago for four days,
he prefers to smoke cannabis.<br>
</p>

<p>Two or three puffs of high grade Northern California
sinsemilla twice or three times a day is sufficient to maintain
his appetite and provide the antidote to the side effects of the
antibiotic and other chemotherapeutic agents. </p>
