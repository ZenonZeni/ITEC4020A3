				</B></I>
				
<P>
A bond is a loan agreement between an issuer and a bondholder.
The bondholder has lent a set amount of money to a government
agency, a municipality or a corporation and expects to be repaid
with interest. Although bonds are loans, and contain no rights of
ownership, they do represent a legally enforceable promise to
repay, and therefore, bondholders are classified as creditors.
				
<P>
The life or term of any bond is fixed at the time of issue and
expires at a fixed maturity date. Upon expiration, the
issuer promises to repay the loan in full, at par value (the
dollar amount of the bond at the time of issue) and on time. Throughout
the life of the loan, the bondholder receives regular interest payments. 
This interest amount is set when the bond
is issued. The interest rate (quoted in dollars) or coupon (quoted
as a percentage) is competitive with what investors can earn elsewhere
on comparable investments.

<P>
Bonds have varying maturity dates that range from short-term
(usually one year or less), to intermediate-term (two to
10 years), to long-term (10 to 30 years).  Generally, the longer
the maturity, the higher the yield of the bond. This higher yield
is offered to compensate for the additional risk of tying up the
investor's money for a longer period of time. Shorter-maturity
bonds have lower yields because the risk of loss of principal
is limited by the shorter time frame. The relationship of the
interest rates paid by the different bond maturities, from short-term
to long-term, is called &quot;the yield curve.&quot;

<P>
Bonds don't always run their full term. You, as a bondholder,
may choose to sell the bond prior to maturity (the price you receive 
will be based on prevailing market conditions) or
the issuer may call the bond and pay off the debt early. A callable
bond is usually redeemed when interest rates drop below a bond's
coupon rate. By paying off the outstanding debt, the issuer has
the opportunity to issue another bond at a lower rate. Callable
bonds are less attractive than non-callable ones because the investor
whose bond has been called is often faced with reinvesting the
money at a possibly lower and less attractive rate. To protect bondholders
expecting long-term steady income, callable bonds usually have
call provisions that specify that a bond can't be called before
a certain number of years, usually five to 10.  It is important for investors to be aware of and understand any call provisions that may exist.
