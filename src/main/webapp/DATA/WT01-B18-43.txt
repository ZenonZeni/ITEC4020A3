&#167; The variation of freshwater inflow into South Texas bays and estuaries is

being examined to document the effects upon the biological communities. Monthly

measurements of hydrography, nutrients and primary productivity are collected in

the Nueces/Corpus Christi Estuary to estimate the enhancement of biological

productivity created by freshwater releases.

&#167; The appearance of a &quot;brown tide&quot; algal bloom that has persisted

for almost six years changed the clear waters of Laguna Madre to a dark

brown color. Samples are collected in upper and lower Laguna Madre to

monitor the severity of the bloom conditions and to relate the distribution of

the organism to physical, chemical and biological processes. The appearance of

persistent algal blooms have become more common in the U.S. and internationally

during the past ten years. We are working with the National Assessment of

Nutrient Enrichment (NANE) and Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) programs of NOAA to

better understand why these blooms are fouling coastal and estuarine waters,

contaminating sea food and killing marine fish and mammals.

&#167; More than 50% of the area of the U.S. drains into the

Mississippi/Atchafalaya River which has a greatly increased organic and nutrient

load as a result of human population increases and widespread use of

fertilizers. The resulting nutrient overenrichment of the river has created

areas of low oxygen near the bottom on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf.

We are studying the

distribution of nutrients and their uptake by phytoplankton near the river delta

and their later regeneration in the zone of low oxygen.

&#167; The Chukchi Sea north of Bering Strait receives northward flowing water

from the North Pacific Ocean after transiting the Bering Sea. These waters

contain large quantities of nutrients which promote very high primary production

rates and ultimately feed the large populations of seals, whales and walrus.

However, these coastal waters of Alaska are undergoing dramatic changes with

respect to contamination and over-harvesting and are important in assessing the

extent of greenhouse warming and climate change. The atmospheric transport of

pesticides and other chemicals into the Arctic accumulates in ice and later in

organisms as they progress up the food chain. Russian and American scientists

are cooperating in programs to investigate the ecology of the Bering/Chukchi

Seas and to determine the changes that may be occurring due to human activities.
