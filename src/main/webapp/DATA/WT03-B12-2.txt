THIS WEEK... FCC ON HOLD

     After 2 weeks of being closed down, FCC's backlog of paperwork
is mounting and Jan. 18 agenda meeting may have to be rescheduled. 
Although talks between Administration and Congress were expected to
continue over weekend, there was no indication when govt. shutdown
would end.  Meanwhile, numerous FCC filing deadlines have come and
gone, applications have been held up and stacks of paperwork are
languishing on conference rooms at law firms throughout city.  Once
FCC gets back to work, it undoubtedly will be hit with avalanche of
requests for rescheduled deadlines in dozens of proceedings.

     FCC's Block C PCS auction, which was declared exempt from
furloughs, received high bids totaling $1.2 billion before
recessing Dec. 21 for Christmas holiday.  Auction, which will
resume Jan. 5, started Dec. 18, day shutdown began.  Specialized
Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued during first week of
shutdown, then recessed until Jan. 2.  FCC officials said SMR
auction was slowing down and Commission may move to Stage 2 bidding
rules after holiday break.

     Things have been quiet up on Capitol Hill too.  Legislators
went home for holiday without settling budget impasse or completing
action on telecom reform bill.  Although conferees week ago were
ballyhooing agreement on telecom legislation, disagreement among
House Republicans stalled final action and Congress adjourned for
holiday without filing conference report.

BIDDING IN FCC'S 2ND PCS AUCTION AT TWICE PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEAR
AGO

     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace with 293
companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds, easily
eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richer
companies sought 99 licenses.  Auction recessed Dec. 21 for
holidays after Round 4 ended with $1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs.
$678.9 million through same stage in earlier auction.  Although
licenses cover same territory, industry observers suggested smaller
service areas in Block C coupled with repeated delays in launching
sales may be contributing to faster pace.  "There is a lot of
pent-up demand for these licenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC
Auctions Div.  Auction resumes Jan. 5. (Fri.)

     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,
more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" and
FCC may move to Stage 2 bidding rules after holiday break, Ham told
us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with $166.9 million in net
revenue from high bids, although Atlanta Trunking's erroneous bid
of $125 million skewed numbers.  Without withdrawal of payment owed
by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is $60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham
said Stage 2 rules require companies to bid on 75% of eligible
pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, or face reduction in
eligibility.  Auction staff will review bidding pace after sale
resumes Jan. 2, she said.

     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushed
back start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,
with further one-week delay during first govt. shutdown.  Ham said
pent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probably
contributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief Michele
Farquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in small
packages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also may
contribute to speed of bidding in current sale.

     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smaller
territories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7
billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused on
revenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. 
Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered more
than one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is geared
to Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.

     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reason
for size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for big
companies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, using
ability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority partner. 
"This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," he
told us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he said
U.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, has
backing from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wireless
entrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-Connect
Communications of Seattle.

     To qualify, companies had to have revenues under $125 million
for last 2 years, and assets below $500 million, but Shosteck said
several companies had up-front payments -- in cash -- of more than
$50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 million and NextWave, which is
thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79 million.  At end of
auction, he said, small companies that bid "will sell out" to
larger companies, leading to news stories on success of
entrepreneurs.

     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,
still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop compared
with other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5
million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) in
Washington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million for
L.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),
DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,
$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  In
Block A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. and
San Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Most
paid $10-$15.

     PCS 2000 is partnership formed in P.R. as Unicom dominated 3
of 4 rounds, paying premium over competitors.  Unicom Pres. Javier
Lamoso said company was created earlier in 1995 specifically to bid
in Block C auction, raising money by selling shares in $25,000
blocks to unidentified bidders.  Company paid $50 million in
upfront payments to qualify for auction, ranking 4th behind
AirWaves, NextWave, GWI PCS.

     Lamoso wouldn't comment on bidding strategy, and said he was
surprised his per-pop total was well above competitors.  "We look
like bullies," he told us from San Juan.  "I've never felt that
way, even when I was in first grade."  Lamoso said he also worked
for Cellular Communication of P.R. and P.R. Cable Assn.

SEVERAL FCC OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN GOVT. BUDGET SHUTDOWN

     Some FCC staffers remained on job as lack of budget caused 2nd
federal govt. shutdown in 5 weeks.  Unlike last time, when only 95
Commission employees were considered "essential" and remained on
job, mostly those working on World Radio Conference, portions of
many bureaus and FCC operations remained open this time.  They
include Auctions Div. handling sales for specialized mobile radio,
Block C PCS and multipoint distribution service (MDS) licenses. 
Govt. has been shut down for more than 2 weeks and, although talks
were expected over weekend, it wasn't certain whether budget
impasse would be over in time to call workers back to their desks
this week.

     FCC working staff included employees for auctions,
International and Wireless Bureaus, litigation employees in Gen.
Counsel's Office (including Gen. Counsel William Kennard) because
of 2 court arguments scheduled in mid-Dec.  As was case during Nov.
shutdown, commissioners are permitted to work, but their personal
staffs aren't, except with special dispensation.

     Commission employees reported to work Dec. 18, were told to
leave with 3 hours' notice.  FCC hq building at 1919 M St. NW, plus
3 other M St. buildings housing Commission offices, posted shutdown
notices on front doors, plus 2-page memorandum from FCC Managing
Dir. Andrew Fishel explaining situation and spelling out employees'
rights.  He cited "sudden emergency requiring curtailment of the
agency's activities;  therefore, no advance notification [to
employees] is possible." 

     As in last shutdown, comments due during shutdown days can be
delivered first day FCC returns to work after impasse ends,
official said.  Filings associated with auctions will be accepted
in lobby of 1919 M St. and reference room at 2025 M St.;  MDS
reference room at 2033 M St. is open, but only for auction-related
business, Commission said.

TELECOM REFORM BILL WAITS FOR THIS WEEK, AT LEAST

     Congress adjourned Dec. 22 for Christmas holiday without
filing conference committee report on telecom reform legislation. 
Senate Republicans and Democrats said final arrangements had been
worked out.  House Democrats were satisfied with language, pending
final examination.  But House Republicans were split:  Commerce
Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), urged members to sign conference
report while Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.), called
legislators from his Houston home to urge them not to sign
conference report.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and
Commerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their own
minds" about which side to take.

     One final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.)
pointed out.  Despite differences between Bliley and Fields, no
bill will be closed out without leadership's approving it, Stearns
said.  At time House adjourned, several Republicans told us they
still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White (R-Wash.) said on
leaving House chamber:  "We're still working on it."  Rep. Oxley
(R-O.) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-Va.), mentioned Internet regulation as
point that should be revisited.  They told us in interviews that
there was no reason that language preventing FCC from regulating
content or prices on Internet should be removed, noting that House
had passed it by large margin.

     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, was
little changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.
Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resulted
in removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC joint
marketing of local and long distance services.  One new phrase was
added to clarify Justice Department's role in determining whether
RHCs should enter long distance.  It said FCC should give DoJ's
opinion "substantial weight," but "such evaluation shall not have
any preclusive effect on any Commission decision..."

     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),
senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question in
my mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreed
upon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospheres
poisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [House
Republicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the Vice
President to announce he opposes it."

FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION

     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wireless
interconnection at final 1995 meeting that would mandate interim
use of "bill-&-keep" as reimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep,
each carrier terminates calls for others at no charge. 
Commissioners said bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is of
essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economically
perfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."

     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissioners
that interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as the
infrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency is
concerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rules
require "mutual compensation" but don't set more specific
requirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Keeney said, and doesn't require setting up new billing
systems.

     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaning
LECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but that
situation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, have
complained that LECs are charging them inflated prices for
terminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCC
action, telephone companies will be able to impede development of
PCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.

     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,
Commission will seek comments on other options such as setting
uniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to
terminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.
Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up with
better system, "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got to
be speedy."

     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCC
compensation proposal that it said would result in decreased fees
to wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said that
under current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECs
for terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECs
don't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIA
Pres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECs
more than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee can
only act to impede development of wireless as a competitive local
exchange service," he said.

     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren't
stepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to set
compensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as was
eagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationship
with the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.
Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting
state PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate
traffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Commission tentatively concluded that information on
LEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public and
will take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, public
disclosure report or other approach.  Agency will seek comment on
whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECs and
all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited to
arrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellular
and specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules to
interconnection between LECs and PCS providers.

     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Golden
called FCC action "an important step for making a right that
existed in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applauded
Commission for "doing something fast and simple" rather than
following "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." 
Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC has
taken so far to promote local telephone competition."

INTERNET PATHS CHALLENGE RHCs FOR LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS

     Several months ago, Nynex quietly pulled plug on one of its
little-known experiments, VermontNet, small bulletin board service
that was started to help start reentry into information services
following crash of expensive and complex InfoLook gateway service. 
Reason for ending service, company said, was that Justice Dept.
didn't agree with how VermontNet provided Internet connectivity.

     Even as Nynex withdrew from Internet, however, Ameritech and
Pacific Telesis moved in and are providing Internet access as part
of service to business customers, without DoJ objections. 
Difference, according to officials of each company, is relationship
among RHC, customer and Internet provider.

     New England Telephone (now Nynex-New England) gradually grew
VermontNet from local bulletin board offering local electronic mail
and opportunities for electronic commerce for neighboring
communities to one providing wider Internet access, including
electronic mail and file transfer protocol (FTP) service, crude
precursor to today's World Wide Web.  Internet e-mail alone "was
enough to send it over the edge," Nynex official said.  Nynex
attorneys talked with DoJ and it became clear that providing
Internet access "was not consistent with Justice's view of the
antitrust decree," company said, noting that Justice interpreted
New England's Internet access as indirectly providing forbidden
interexchange service.  Nynex had contracted with 3rd party for
transport to Internet access, but by connecting its service to
Internet service provider, Nynex permitted customers to get service
around world, Nynex official said.  Nothing ever was put in
writing, with opinions from DoJ coming in conversations with Nynex
attorneys.

     In theory, network arrangements between telco and long
distance company are similar to those between telco and Internet. 
In each case, telco sends call to switch of another service, which
then transports it to destination out of local calling area.  But
Nynex officials said key difference wasn't in network but in
economics.  In telephony, subscribers pay telco monthly bill for
local service and pay separate bill to long-distance carrier.  With
VermontNet, subscribers paid flat fee that included Internet
charges that VermontNet paid to Internet service provider to be
hooked into Internet.  "That's where the violation is," Nynex
official said, adding that it was Nynex that recognized there might
be problem, consulted DoJ and then took down service.  Official
said that important factor to consider wasn't whether Nynex
violated MFJ but that under law local telco couldn't be Internet
service provider, which it wants to be.  Also important, he said,
is that law should be changed.

     With other RHCs, MFJ questions have been avoided by
structuring service differently.  Pacific Telesis, not Pacific
Bell, offers entire package of services on server, ranging from
hosting customer information, such as Web site, obtaining domain
name (such as pbi.com), routing customer's Internet access to local
Internet service provider, providing Web browsers such as Netscape
and mail programs such as Eudora for customer local area networks. 
One thing Pacific doesn't do is provide direct link to Internet or
select path for getting there.

     Telesis attorney Keith Epstein said that when customers
contract for Internet services, they're given choice of Internet
provider much as those signing up for regular telephone service are
given choice of long distance carrier.  Telesis calls can't leave
LATA and can provide connection only to Internet.  Epstein said: 
"It's a weird way to provide service.  It's what we need to do."

     Ameritech also entered Internet business through its Advanced
Data Services unit, which isn't part of its regulated telephone
companies.  Ameritech data unit packages range of products and
services, starting with broadband access for businesses, including
hosting of customer Internet data for Web sites, gopher servers or
newsgroups, while providing local high-speed access to Internet,
such as through frame relay or other broadband data services.  As
with Pacific, however, Ameritech stops when it reaches Internet
service provider.  Spokesman Richard Maganini said customers must
choose their own Internet carrier.  As with Pacific, Ameritech also
offers customers help in registering Internet domain names, manages
customers' network and provides single point of contact for
Internet connectivity, while giving client single bill. 
Promotional material for Ameritech's Dedicated Internet Access
Service notes that service is flexible because "Ameritech allows
you to choose your route to the Internet."  But brochure also says: 
"You [customer] will also need to choose a Long Distance Internet
Provider for global access to the Internet."

RESELLERS FIGHT NEW AT&T BILLING POLICY REMOVING ITS NAME FROM
BILLS

     Telecommunications Resellers Assn. (TRA) is meeting with AT&T
in hope of convincing it to reconsider new billing policy for
aggregators and other resellers.  AT&T, which provides end-user
billing and support service for some resellers, wants to reduce its
name identification on those bills.  For example, it would remove
its name and logo from end-user bills and delete AT&T billing,
maintenance and customer service numbers.  AT&T identification
would be replaced by name, logo and numbers of resale carrier. 
Aggregators, which tend to be smaller than many resellers, would be
hardest hit by new policy, TRA said.  They resemble buying groups,
buying AT&T service in bulk and reselling it to end users.

     TRA Gen. Counsel Charles Hunter said talks have produced "some
movement," though not enough to ease Assn.'s concerns.  He said
AT&T has indicated willingness to:  (1) Grandfather use of AT&T's
customer maintenance number for life of existing contracts.  (2)
Permit its logo to be used on joint letters to customers explaining
changes.  (3) Allow aggregators to retain blue border on bills,
indicating similarity to AT&T bills.  (4) Delay start date to June
1 from earlier in spring.

     Nonetheless, "potential for damage is still very substantial,"
Hunter said.  Selling point for resellers is identification with
AT&T, he said, then "all of a sudden, the bill looks different and
the customer doesn't hear AT&T when the phone is answered."  He
said "there is a very real fear of substantial customer attrition,"
with some resellers estimating they could lose upward of 40% of
their customer base.  In addition, AT&T policy change could lead to
additional "back office" costs for resellers that have relied
exclusively on AT&T to provide billing and customer service, Hunter
said, and there could be regulatory changes as well.  Because AT&T
action could change role of aggregators, they may have to obtain
authorization by FCC or states as resale carriers, he said: 
"Depending on which states are involved, this process can take 9 to
12 months or more, at a potential cost of more than $100,000."

     AT&T spokeswoman Karen Way said "confusion to customers" is
reason company wants to take its name off reseller bills.  Several
states, including Fla., have ordered AT&T to change practice
"because of problems with misrepresentation and slamming," she
said.  There's no way of knowing whether customer is slammed by
reseller because AT&T's name, rather than reseller's, continues to
appear on bill, Way said.  Change "brings AT&T's practices in line
with industry practices and state PUC requirements," she said.

     Two AT&T billing services are affected:  (1) Bill Manager
Service, which resellers can buy from AT&T.  Service not only
renders bills, it also provides customer service.  (2)
Multilocation billing, which was designed for use by AT&T corporate
customers that need separate bills sent to various offices. 
Resellers use service to send bills to their end-user customers.

AT&T ABANDONING LECs FOR BILLING, SENDS OWN BILLS DIRECTLY TO
CUSTOMERS

     AT&T returns to consumer billing this month when it begins
sending more than 500,000 long distance customers in Cal., Fla. and
Tex. bills for service, separate from GTE bills that now carry
IXC's charges.  AT&T targeted 3 states and GTE for launch but
eventually will direct-bill all LEC customers, giving company
access to customers, it said.  AT&T said process gives it
opportunity to notify customers of promotions and other special
benefits, while also providing updates on benefit and loyalty
credits.  "We do need to be able to communicate directly with our
customers," said Nancy Smith of AT&T Consumer Service unit.  Before
divestiture, AT&T handled billing for all services.

     Move also allows AT&T to bypass LECs that currently don't
allow IXCs or other carriers to communicate directly with customers
through billing process.  For example, new AT&T bill will include
information on alternate calling plans, True Reward credits for
participants in loyalty program, cost savings based on competing
services.  Official said bill also will give customer long distance
plan options based on calling patterns monitored by company.  For
example, cheaper rates might be available for certain kinds of
service or at certain times of day, and such information would be
reflected on new bill, carrier said.

     AT&T official said new bills being introduced in GTE territory
eventually will appear in other regions, but declined to reveal
timetable or targets for next year.  Ultimately, company plans to
provide service to most of its 80 million residential customers, as
it does for 10 million business customers, official said.  Bills
are printed in Charlotte, N.C., and official said company doesn't
have plans to erect other billing centers.

     GTE officials didn't comment on AT&T plans, which will give
GTE-AT&T customers in 3 states separate bills.  GTE provides
service in Tampa, most of Tex. and substantial portions of Southern
Cal.

     New AT&T bills are larger than many of LECs', which are 4"x7"
and printed on one side of page.  New version is 6-1/2"x10", with
wide margins where service-type information is carried.  First page
includes summary of charges, with section showing savings compared
against AT&T standard rates and points earned in loyalty program.

     LECs said they were aware of AT&T plans.  Ameritech said move
would further confuse customers already bombarded by bills and
messages from utilities, including LEC.  At Nynex, for example,
AT&T recently signed one-year contract to continue using LEC for
billing customers, Nynex spokesman Bob Varettoni said.  "It's a
competitive market.  People can do what they want to do."  He said
Nynex had attractive billing and collection service for other
carriers.  Company declined to elaborate on contract terms with
IXCs.

     Nynex also will unveil new bills this month, beginning with
500,000 customers in Buffalo and reaching all by end of first
quarter, he said.  Bills will include promotional and cost-saving
information, similar to AT&T's, but features won't be extended to
IXCs or other carriers.  He said summary page will spell out costs
clearly for local, interLATA long distance and other long distance
charges along with total for billing period:  "It will be an
attractive package" based on "lot of" customer research.

     Ameritech spokesman said company thought move would add
confusion in residential market.  "Why should they reinvent what
already exists," spokesman said.  Like Nynex, Ameritech provides
billing and collection services as "common carrier" to all
companies, for fee.

CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31
ENTRANTS

     Cal. PUC  approved rules to open local telephone loop Jan. 1
and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope to become local
exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broad cross-section of
telecom industry and at least one electric utility.  PUC said rules
are "largely the same" as proposed regulations released in July
that set broader outline for opening markets.  Agency also adopted
3-year freeze on price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and
lowered productivity factor to rate of inflation because
"underlying assumptions and data" that created current 5% factor
are "obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 small
telcos.

     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,
Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,
Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, Century
Telecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, Electric
Lightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI Metro
Access Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,
Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.

     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim number
portability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,
PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabled
residents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote call
forwarding in separate proceeding early next year.  All telecom
providers will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and
"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergency
services even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. 
Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiring
written confirmation of each sale, with description of services and
price breakdowns.

     In other actions, PUC:  (1) Granted rate increases to 4 small
telcos -- Calaveras (68.5%), Hornitos (379%), GTE W. Coast (30.6%),
Happy Valley (29.6% for Olinda, and 53.2% for Platina exchange) --
and approved changes in state's high-cost fund, which subsidizes
rural telephone rates.  Portion of increases for Calaveras and
Hornitos will be offset by elimination of suburban mileage charges,
PUC said, covering 80% of boost for Calaveras and 20% for Hornitos. 
Agency reduced to 0.27% from 0.5% amount companies must contribute
to high-cost fund because it has grown since last year while total
draw has decreased 44%.

     (2) Released its report to state legislature on how
competition may affect universal service and proposed that basic
service include 911 access, free customer service, directory
assistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund to
subsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobby
legislature to change existing law to make change possible. 
Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make sure
they received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, and
would base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential with
incentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitive
bidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. 
Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schools
to new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale of
telecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also should
meet same service quality standards, PUC said.

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home
wiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is needed
because of convergence of industries.  Action was taken at Dec. 15
agenda meeting.  Rulemaking will deal with demarcation between
customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage and
quality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE) and
division of state and federal responsibilities.  Regulation of
cable and telcos should be comparable "where appropriate," FCC
Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate "where it makes
sense."  Comr. Chong said she would have preferred to move
demarcation point immediately, but went along with launching
rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly."  Chmn. Hundt
said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitive advantage" for
incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE market as competitive
as telephone equipment market.  Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1)
What demarcation point would be appropriate, acknowledging it might
be different for single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2)
Whether telcos' broadband services should have to meet same signal
leakage and signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable
should have to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system,
as telcos have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same
regulatory distinctions between residential and nonresidential
wiring as telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to
in-home broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to
divide regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise
authorities, states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal
regulation of telephony and video programming.

     FCC Wireless Bureau rejected Radiofone request for delay in
Block C PCS auction, saying company's request for emergency relief
didn't meet test required and would hurt bidders in current
auction.  Order signed by Michele Farquhar, acting chief of Bureau,
said granting stay in fact would cause "irreparable harm to other
parties and would be inconsistent with the public interest." 
Radiofone sought stay Dec. 8 as part of challenge to Commission's
rules barring cellular license holders from seeking 30 MHz PCS
licenses in same region.  Order said Radiofone's argument that
Commission can't apply its rules to restrict ownership is
insufficient to overturn rulemaking developed last year.  "It is
very unlikely that the Commission would... reexamine the merits of
the 45 MHz spectrum cap, which was adopted a little over a year ago
to promote competition, discourage anticompetitive behavior and
create incentives for innovation and efficiency in CMRS [Commercial
Mobile Radio Service], including broadband PCS," order said.  It
also said rule wasn't at issue when 6th U.S. Appeals Court,
Cincinnati, remanded rulemaking to Commission.  Bureau said further
delay in auction, which began Dec. 18, "will cause severe harm to
each of the other C Block applicants."

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC
seeking to avoid substantial withdrawn-bid penalty in specialized
mobile radio auction (SMR) after intended $125,000 bid became $125
million error.  Company said bid filed electronically carried 3
extra zeros.  In waiver request, it asked Commission to consider
size of company and nature of mistake in granting waiver.  Full
Commission will have to review request at end of auction, lawyer
Diane Law said Thurs.  Under FCC rules, companies that withdraw
bids are liable for penalty based on difference between withdrawn
offer and eventual high bid at end of sale.  Company earlier bid
$1,100 for same license, designated P frequency block;  high bid
before error was about $100,000, submitted by FCI 900 -- which is
Nextel.  Atlanta Trunking resubmitted $125,000 bid in Round 10, FCC
said.  Efforts to contact company, part of Southland Corp. and SMR
operator at 900 MHz in Atlanta, were unsuccessful.

brought by Debbra Wright, who charged cellular telephone caused
brain cancer and who accused industry of conspiracy to conceal
evidence.  Judge Paddy McNamara said Wright case, originally filed
against Motorola, included substantial evidence, but nothing
linking HES to conspiracy.  He's expected to issue written opinion
this month and rule in March on similar charges Wright filed
against Wireless Technology Research (WTR), which also is headed by
Carlo and set up by industry to study health effects of cellular
phones.  WTR said all allegations should be dismissed because "they
are based on the same key factual issues the judge has now
resolved... WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are
wasteful attacks on the scientific community, that they slow
completion of the research necessary to answer the public's
questions about the health effects of all wireless technology and
that these tactics could themselves pose threats to public health
if they delay implementation of any interventions that may prove
necessary."

"All we are asking for is the opportunity to pay for our own ads to
tell our side of the story."  Official said station doesn't carry
issue-oriented ads, such as CWA spots.  "It wasn't in response to
the issues that CWA raises," spokeswoman said.  Station and
ABC-owned WPVI, also Philadelphia, rejected all CWA ads focusing on
bargaining with BA, she said.  Company commercials discuss service
options and describe corporate initiatives, don't address labor

     RHCs' share of access revenues is likely to decline to 80%

     RHCs' share of access revenues is likely to decline to 80%
from current 97% when local competition begins, putting pressure on
cash flows and causing drop in average credit ratings to A1 from
Aa3, Moody's said.  Revenue growth will slow to 1.4% annually
through 1999 compared with average 2.2% growth for 5 years through
1994, rating agency said.  "Unprecedented challenge" to residential
and business customer base will occur with or without reform
legislation, as state lawmakers and regulators seek to open
markets, said Stephen Gutkowski, vp-senior credit officer. 
Business segment will be first target of competitors, he said, with
residential competition much later.  "It will be a number of years
before any facilities-based alternative can provide a mass-marketed
switched voice service that will have a material impact on the
telephone companies' market share."  RHC revenues also will be hit
by bypass technologies and price cuts charged to IXCs, to 1.5 cents
per min. from current 3 cents, Gutkowski said.  "Moody's believes
the loss of market share in existing lines of business will have
greater impact on credit quality than the possible benefits from
entering new lines of business," he said.

     U.S. and Mexico will look into allegations by Telephone
Workers Union of Mexico that Sprint closed La Conexion Familiar
subsidiary in San Francisco to harm union, U.S. Dept. of Labor
(DoL) officials said.  Examination will focus on how plant closings
affect union organizing, DoL said.  However, it won't lead to any
penalties because only NLRB has jurisdiction, said Jack Otero,
deputy undersecretary for international affairs.  NLRB judge in
Aug. ruled that San Francisco unit was closed primarily because it
was losing money, although 50 job-related violations were noted. 
Sprint made shutdown decision 8 days before scheduled employee vote
on joining CWA.  Study will be conducted by Labor Secretariat,
organization of U.S., Mexican and Canadian officials set up to
review labor conditions under NAFTA.  CWA and Sprint said case was
unlikely to cause Sprint regulatory problems in Mexico.  Mexican
govt. officials had complained about closing, saying U.S. wasn't
enforcing its labor laws.

     Bell Atlantic (BA) submitted price cap plan to Md. PSC that
proposes 5 categories:  (1) "Access," covering long distance
connections.  (2) "Basic-Residential" for nonbusiness lines.  (3)
"Basic-Other" for business lines.  (4) Discretionary, covering
optional services such as call waiting and call forwarding.  (5)
Competitive, for services offered by other providers such as
Centrex and speed dialing.  BA said it will cap access and
basic-residential rates for 2 years, basic-other for one year. 
After that, it said, it would adjust services based on Gross
Domestic Product price index minus 1.5%.  Discretionary services
wouldn't rise more than 25% per year, BA said, but competitive
services would be unregulated.  It also said plan would preserve
existing quality-of-service standards.  MCI submitted its own price
cap plan for BA last month that it claimed would shave $72 million
off intrastate toll rates.  However, BA has criticized that
proposal as "rate-of-return in sheep's clothing," saying it
underestimated universal service costs by $47 million.
