Carl,

<P>First my I start by saying.&nbsp; GOD BLESS YOU!&nbsp; I suffer form cronic migrains an anvage of 150 hours / week for the last 16 years, that is until I read information in a small artical you wrote or provided last year about use of THC for migrain headaches.&nbsp; The last 9 months has been a DRASTIC improvement...8-).&nbsp; I have been on 12 diffrent medications for the headaches from Midrin, Cataflam, Butralbital APAP to Codine and Morpine.&nbsp; And Tropol XL for heart rate durring headaches.&nbsp; But now 
The THC ( smoked ), I only use Midrin for the heavy attacks and Tropor because the canabis does increase my heart rate.&nbsp; The Marijuana allows me to preform daily activity including, work! and Mountian Bike raceing.&nbsp; I owe you my life...&nbsp; No shit.&nbsp; I was at the end of my rope.&nbsp; I could not stand it.&nbsp; I woke up crying everyday, mad I 
did not die in my sleep.&nbsp; Afraid to wake up a face another day in hell.&nbsp; Once more, THANK YOU!!!
