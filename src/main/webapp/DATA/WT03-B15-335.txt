MK RETURNS TO MONGOLIA<p>
</b></center>

BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that it has been awarded 
a $3.6 million contract to provide procurement and engineering services to 
the Mongolian Ministry of Energy on behalf of the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID). The  Energy Sector Project Phase I 
calls for the emergency procurement of coal mine and power plant
commodities and providing requisite engineering assistance to help 
maintain adequate power and heating supplies for the capital city, 
Ulaanbaatar, during the 1996-97 winter season.  After the breakup of the 
former Soviet Union, MK pioneered U.S. assistance to the Mongolian people 
working in the Mongolian mining and power sectors from 1992 through 1995.<p> 
      MK's President and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Tinstman 
stated, "We welcome the opportunity to once again represent our 
government's mission in Mongolia and help avert potential widespread 
suffering for the Mongolian people this winter.  Using our talents to help 
others around the world is truly in the finest spirit of Emkayans."<p>
     The Operations and Maintenance Division of MK's Engineering and 
Construction Group will begin work on the project immediately and is 
expected to complete Phase I in April 1997.   Phase II of the project, if 
authorized, would provide similar assistance for the 1997-98 winter 
season.<P>
     The O&M Division provides facility operations and maintenance,
worldwide logistics and materials management, facilities engineering,
and military base operations support to a wide range of private and
public clients.  Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE--MK), founded in 1912,
serves the world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance, 
industrial, process, power, heavy construction, mining and transportation
markets as an engineer and constructor.<p>
