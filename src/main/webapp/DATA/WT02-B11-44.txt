<a name="label1">
<H2>6.1. Historical Overview</H2>
<p>
In 1479, King Christian I got the Pope's permission to establish 
the University of Copenhagen. And it was for nearly 400 years the 
only higher education institution in Denmark, but during the 19th 
century a number of specialised institutions were established, 
i.a. the Technical University of Denmark, the Royal Veterinary and 
Agricultural University, the Royal Dental College and the Royal 
Danish School of Pharmacy. The remaining higher education 
institutions in the university sector all originate in this 
century.
<p>
<a name="label2">
<H2>6.2. Specific Legislative Framework</H2>
<p>
The legislative basis for the courses at universities and other  
higher education institutions in the university sector is the 
University Act of 1993, which authorises the Ministry to lay down 
regulations for the courses. The University Act does not contain 
any provisions regarding the structure and content of the courses.
<p>
Corresponding framework regulations exist for other higher 
education institutions.
<p>
The Ministry of Education lays down general guidelines for the 
individual courses in education orders which contain general 
provisions regarding the aims, duration, structure, main content, 
examinations etc.
<p>
For some courses, the education orders contain rather detailed 
provisions regarding the organisation of the courses, but a great 
and ever increasing part of the orders are framework orders which 
merely lay down the general framework of the courses.
<p>
In keeping with the framework of the orders, the individual 
educational institutions draw up a curriculum which describes the 
content and structure of the individual courses.
<p>
<a name="label3">
<H2>6.3. General Description of the Structure of Higher Education</H2>
<p>
Higher education comprises the following categories of education:
<ol>

<LI> short-cycle non-university higher education, i.e. further
technical and commercial education

<LI> medium-cycle non-university education

<LI> medium- and long-cycle university education

<LI> post-graduate university education (i.e. Ph.D., doctorates)
</ol>
<p>
<a name="label4">
<H3>6.3.1. Short-cycle non-university higher education</H3>
<p>
This heading covers further technical and commercial education 
courses of 1-2½ years' duration.
<p>
<a name="label5">
<H4>6.3.1.1. Types of Institutions</H4>
<p>
Apart from a few exceptions, all the further technical and 
commercial education courses are offered at technical and 
commercial schools, respectively, i.e. the same schools which 
offer the vocational education and training courses and the 
vocational upper secondary courses [see chapter 5], which 
generally constitute the foundation of the further education 
courses.
<p>
<a name="label6">
<H4>6.3.1.2. Admission requirements</H4>
<p>
In order to be admitted to one of the further technical education 
courses, students must have completed a vocational education and 
training course within a field which is relevant for the chosen 
study programme. Students who have completed a course at general 
upper secondary level or the ["HTX"] are also eligible for 
admission, but their course will be extended with 1-1½ years 
(workshop course + practical training in a business).
<p>
In order to be admitted to one of the further commercial education 
courses, students must have completed the ["Studentereksamen"], 
the ["HF"]-examination or the ["HHX"]- or ["HTX"]-examination. In 
one case, i.e. the "Academy economics" course, students with a 
completed vocational education and training course in the field of 
commerce, clerical trades and public administation are also 
eligible for admission.
<p>
<a name="label7">
<H4>6.3.1.3. Branches of Study, Specialisation</H4>
<p>
Further technical and commercial courses are i.a. offered within 
the following specialisations: electronics, forestry, land 
surveying, building, textile, graphic design, environmental 
technology, hospital laboratory work, export technology, commerce, 
market economics, computer studies etc.
<p>
<a name="label8">
<H4>6.3.1.4. General Objectives</H4>
<p>
It is the general objective of the courses that the students 
acquire competence within the chosen specialisation which 
qualifies them for participation in and the execution of versatile 
functions within the given specialisation.
<p>
The further technical education courses mainly aim at employment 
which comprises operational, planning and construction tasks.
<p>
The further commercial education courses aim at independent 
performance of commercial and administrative functions in trade 
and industry.
<p>
<a name="label9">
<H4>6.3.1.5. Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours</H4>
<p>
As curriculum, subjects etc. is not the same for the further 
technical and the further commercial courses, they are dealt with 
separately. 
<p>
<a name="label10">
<H5>6.3.1.5.1. Further technical education</H5>
<p>
The courses are organised in continuation of the initial 
vocational education and training courses. The instruction is 
mainly theoretical and takes its point of departure in the 
knowledge acquired in the initial education. 
<p>
The further technical education courses are normally grouped into 
areas. The courses comprise teaching of a theoretical and 
practical nature, including in technological and workshop- or 
laboratory-technical subjects as well as in general subjects. In 
addition, there must be teaching in optional subjects, including 
subjects, which are specially adapted to meet local needs.
<p>
Further technical education courses within a given area are 
normally introduced with teaching which is common to the courses 
of the area. The subsequent teaching is carried out within the 
individual specialisation.
<p>
There are also such optional subjects as English, written English, 
German, technical German. The options vary at the different 
schools.
<p>
As an example can be mentioned the 1½-year electronics technicians 
course which comprises mathematics, edp-application, data 
communication, quality control, electro-technical subjects, 
English, economics, business administration, environment, 
organisation, management etc.
<p>
<a name="label11">
<H5>6.3.1.5.2. Further commercial education</H5>
<p>
At this moment, there are still only a few courses under this 
category, viz. the courses in specialised computer studies, market 
economics and academy economics.
<p>
The 2½-year full-time in specialised computer studies is divided 
into 5 semesters with an overall teaching theme for each semester. 
The students have to draw up an examination project in the 5th 
semester. The students acquire skills in solving problems and in 
finding theories and methods for their solution. It is a course 
with a great width, where the students are however given a 
possibility of immersion in one or more specialised areas.
<p>
The 2-year full-time course in market economics comprises subjects 
such as foreign languages and cultures, international marketing 
and international economics, business economics, production 
organisation, business law, administrative systems and statistics.
<p>
<a name="label12">
<H4>6.3.1.6. Methods</H4>
<p>
Examples are given for further technical education and further 
commercial education. 
<p>
<a name="label13">
<H5>6.3.1.6.1. Further technical education</H5>
<p>
The teaching is organised so that the general subjects 
(mathematics, physics, languages etc.) are closely linked to the 
technical topics, as the teaching focuses on application rather 
than on pure theory.
<p>
<a name="label14">
<H5>6.3.1.6.2. Further commercial education</H5>
<p>
The course in specialised computer studies is divided into 5 
semesters with an overall teaching theme for each semester.
<p>
The first year of the market economics course is divided into 2 
semesters, the second year into 3 trimesters. The course is taken 
within one of the branches: international marketing, logistics or 
financial control.
<p>
<a name="label15">
<H4>6.3.1.7. Student Evaluation</H4>
<p>
Examples are given for further technical education and further 
commercial education. 
<p>
<a name="label16">
<H5>6.3.1.7.1. Further technical education</H5>
<p>
Immediately prior to the examination period in the last part of 
the course, the school decides on each student's eligibility to 
sit for the final examination. This decision is taken on the basis 
of an ongoing internal evaluation of the student's participation 
in and profit gained from the teaching, including the written work 
handed in by the student.
<p>
The part-examinations which form part of the final examination are 
carried out in accordance with the rules laid down in the 
evaluation plan 
<OL>
<LI>as course work, which may be carried out in cooperation with a 
business or in the form of group work

<LI> as a project, which may be carried out in cooperation with a 
business or in the form of group work

<LI>as an oral examination, i.e. a dialogue between the student and
the teacher-examiner as well as an external examiner

<LI> as a written examination, i.e. individual written paper in
response to written questions, etc.
</ol>
<p>
The evaluation basis is the student's performance at the 
examination in the given subject. Marks are given according to the 
13-point marking scale, and the examination is considered passed,  
when the sum of all examination marks equals or exceeds the number 
of examination marks multiplied by 6.
<p>
<a name="label17">
<H5>6.3.1.7.2. Further commercial education</H5>
<p>
As the rules regarding evaluation may differ, the market economics 
course has been chosen as an example:
<p>
The final examination consists of part-examinations taken after 
the 2nd semester and after the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd 
trimesters. Furthermore, there are two written tests after the 1st 
semester.
<p>
Obligatory theme papers are handed in after the 1st and 2nd 
semesters, and access to the next phases of the course is 
dependent on a successful evaluation of these papers.
<p>
External examiners appointed by the Ministry of Education take 
part in the final examinations. The evaluation is made by the 
subject-teacher/examiner and the external examiner, and the 
13-point marking scale is used for the evaluation. 
<p>
The final examination is considered passed, when the weighted 
average of all examination marks amounts to at least 6, and no 
marks below 5 have been given.
<p>
<a name="label18">
<H4>6.3.1.8. Promotion, Educational Guidance</H4>
<p>
When a student fails at an examination in the further technical 
education courses, or fails to register for an examination or 
chooses to repeat, the school decides which part of the course the 
student must repeat. It is possible to repeat a part of the course 
up to 2 times during the course. The student cannot continue on 
the next part of the course, when the assessments already obtained 
imply that the examination will not be passed. 
<p>
There are no general rules regarding further commercial education; 
therefore the market economics course has been used as an example. 
This course is very strictly regulated and students have to have 
participated in the teaching to an extent deemed satisfactory by 
the school and have to have handed in the number of prescribed 
papers in order to continue on the subsequent semesters of the 
course.
<p>
Applicants to and students enrolled in the courses are offered 
guidance with a view to their choice of education and occupation.
<p>
In further technical education courses with several 
specialisations, a student can only supplement the chosen 
specialisation with another specialisation according to the rules 
applying to open education. As the further commercial education 
courses are so few and different from each other, it is not 
possible to transfer from one branch to another.
<p>
<a name="label19">
<H4>6.3.1.9. Certification</H4>
<p>
The school issues a diploma to students who have successfully 
completed the final examination. According to regulations laid 
down by the Ministry of Education, the diplomas must contain the 
following information: 
<p>
<a name="label20">
<H5>6.3.1.9.1. Further technical education:</H5>
<p>

<p>
The courses give study competence to pursue studies at higher 
levels of the education system.
<p>
<a name="label22">
<H4>6.3.1.10. Openings, Training-Employment Relationship</H4>
<p>
Some further technical education courses contain a practical 
training element, whereby the student must spend a certain period 
of practical training in a business. Guidelines are laid down by 
the Technical Education Committee regarding the content and 
possible assessment of the practical training.
<p>
<a name="label23">
<H4>6.3.1.11. Special Assistance for Pupils</H4>
<p>
For students with special prerequisites, the examinations are 
organised under forms and conditions which comply with the 
prerequisites of the students in accordance with the provisions 
regarding special educational support.
<p>
<a name="label24">
<H3>6.3.2. Medium-Cycle Non-University Higher Education</H3>
<p>
There is a wide range of different courses of this type qualifying 
for as many professions. Particulars are given under the different 
headings. But in order to give a more detailed picture, two 
courses have been singled out as examples: the nursing education 
and the social work education.
<p>
<a name="label25">
<H4>6.3.2.1. Types of Institutions</H4>
<p>
The medium-cycle non-university higher education courses are 
offered by a great number of different specialised institutions of 
varying size: schools of social work, schools of midwifery, 
schools of occupational therapy, schools of physiotherapy, schools 
of hospital laboratory work, schools of journalism, schools of 
film production, schools of nursing, colleges of education etc.
<p>
<a name="label26">
<H4>6.3.2.2. Admission Requirements</H4>
<p>
The general admission requirements for all the courses is the 
completion of one of the qualifying examinations at upper 
secondary level:
<p>
<ol>

<LI> the ["Studentereksamen"]

<LI> the ["Højere Forberedelseseksamen"]

<LI> the ["Højere Handelseksamen"], or

<LI> the ["Højere Teknisk Eksamen"].
</ol>
<p>
Some schools, e.g. the film school and the school of journalism 
have their own aptitude tests. But in general, students are 
granted admission on the basis of the average mark obtained at the 
final examination at upper secondary level.
<p>
Finally, there may be a number of special requirements regarding 
certain subjects at high level, work experience etc.
<p>
<a name="label27">
<H4>6.3.2.3. Branches of Study, Specialisation</H4>
<p>
The branches of study and specialisations at this level may be: 
social work, midwifery, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, 
hospital laboratory work, nursing, journalism, film production, 
educator, ["Folkeskole"]-teacher etc.
<p>
<a name="label28">
<H4>6.3.2.4. General Objectives</H4>
<p>
There are no general objectives covering this whole area of 
education, but the education orders for the individual courses 
each contain a section with the aims of the particular course.
<p>
Ex. Order on the Training of Nurses: "It is the aim of the course 
that the student develops and acquires personal and professional 
qualifications to practice as a nurse. It is furthermore the aim 
that the student acquires the prerequisites for cooperation, for 
professional innovation in step with the scientific and social 
development as well as for the development of the nursing 
profession."
<p>
Ex. Order on the Training of Social Workers: "It is the aim of the 
course to qualify the student to assume the functions of a social 
worker within the social work area in State, municipal, county and 
private administrations, institutions and businesses as well as to 
provide the students with a basis for following the development 
within this area."
<p>
<a name="label29">
<H4>6.3.2.5. Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours</H4>
<p>
As examples have been chosen the nursing education and the 
education of social workers. 
<p>
<a name="label30">
<H5>6.3.2.5.1. Nursing</H5>
<p>
The nursing course is of 45 months' duration and consists of 
theoretical education and clinical education. The course is 
divided into 3 parts, each of 1-1½ years' duration. 
<p>
The course comprises education in the role of the nurse in 
promotion and maintenance of health, prevention, treatment, 
palliation and rehabilitation. The education is organised in such 
a way that the initial part comprises the fundamental functions of 
a nurse. The two subsequent parts include the more specific 
functions of a nurse, and they are organised in such a way that 
the degree of difficulty increases so that the last part comprises 
independent practice of nursing.
<p>
The theoretical education consists of the following scientific 
fields, each of which comprises approx. the following percentages 
of the total theoretical education: nursing and other health 
sciences (nursing theory and methodology, epidemiology, pathology, 
nutrition, pharmacology, and social, occupational and 
environmental medicine): 60%; natural sciences (anatomy, 
physiology, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, 
clinical chemistry, genetics): 20%; and arts and social sciences 
(psychology, pedagogics, sociology, communication, structure and 
functions of the health and social services, including 
legislation, administration as well as philosophy and ethics): 
20%. The exact organisation of the theoretical education is laid 
down in a curriculum.
<p>
The clinical education consists of the following main fields, each 
of which must comprise approx. the following percentages of the 
total clinical education: nursing care to healthy people and 
people whose health is at risk: 25%; nursing care to people 
suffering from acute and chronic, somatic and mental illness: 75%.
<p>
<a name="label31">
<H5>6.3.2.5.2. Social work</H5>
<p>
The course is of 3 years' duration, including a 5-month practical 
training period in the 3rd-4th semester of the course.
<p>
The course comprises the following subject areas with the 
following minimum number of lessons:

<p>
A major part of the work with the subject-areas consists of 
project work, the aim of which is to give the students an 
interdisciplinary comprehensive understanding of the interaction 
between the structures of society and the conditions of life and 
behaviour of the individual human being and thereby integrate and 
translate the knowledge and understanding they have acquired 
through the courses as well as to enable them to determine 
concretely the factors which cause social problems and to 
translate this understanding into concrete practical work with 
such problems. The project work takes place within two problem 
fields: 1) Social work - individual, family and society and 2) 
Social work - institutions.
<p>
The practical part of the training takes place during the entire 
3rd and 4th semesters. It normally takes place in a municipal or 
county social or health administration. It is the aim of the 
practical training that the student gets a concrete insight into 
and understanding of the different typical functions of a social 
worker, gets some proficiency in translating the theoretical 
knowledge into practical work with concrete social cases, 
including client contact, is trained to cooperate with other 
professional groups on concrete social problems and gets a basis 
for assessing his/her prerequisites for working as a social 
worker.

<H4>6.3.2.6. Methods</H4>
<p>
As above, two examples of courses have been chosen to describe 
this level of higher education: nursing and social work. 
<p>
<a name="label33">
<H5>6.3.2.6.1. Nursing</H5>
<p>
The education comprises a theoretical part and a clinical part in 
a proportion of 5 to 4. The theoretical part of the course is 
structured in different scientific fields, see [6.3.2.5.1.].
<p>
<a name="label34">
<H5>6.3.2.6.2. Social work</H5>
<p>
The work with the subject-areas is organised as a combination of 
subject-area-oriented courses and problem-oriented, 
interdisciplinary project work. Seminars may form part of courses 
and project work, and support courses may be held in connection 
with the project work. Field work is integrated in the project 
work. Finally, there is a coherent 5-month practical training 
period in the 3rd and 4th semester of the course.
<p>
<a name="label35">
<H4>6.3.2.7. Student Evaluation</H4>
<p>
As above, two examples of courses have been chosen to describe 
this level of higher education: nursing and social work. 
<p>
<a name="label36">
<H5>6.3.2.7.1. Nursing</H5>
<p>
The qualifications acquired during the education are documented 
through examinations in connection with the theoretical education 
and general proficiency assessments in connection with the 
clinical education.
<p>
The examinations are internal or external. Internal examinations 
are assessed by the teacher-examiner(s) and one or more examiners 
appointed by the educational institution. External examinations 
are assessed by the teacher-examiner and one or more examiners 
appointed by the Ministry of Education. The 13-point marking scale 
is used for both the internal and the external examinations. It is 
however possible to use the assessment of pass/fail.
<p>
The assessment of pass/fail is used for general proficiency 
assessments.
<p>
External examinations are held at the end of each of the 3 parts 
of the course. General proficiency assessments are given on 
completion of the clinical education in each of the 3 parts of the 
course.
<p>
All examinations and general proficiency assessments must be 
passed. An examination is considered passed, when a mark of 6 or 
more or the assessment of pass have been obtained. Each 
examination must be passed individually.
<p>
It is not possible to repeat examinations which have been passed. 
Students can sit for examinations in a subject 3 times. Under 
certain circumstances, the institution may permit a forth time.
<p>
Students who have failed a general proficiency evaluation may be 
evaluated again after repeated clinical education.
<p>
<a name="label37">
<H5>6.3.2.7.2. Social work</H5>
<p>
Written examinations (subject-area examinations) are held in the 
subjects areas of social law; family law, civil law, and 
administration of justice etc.; administrative studies; labour 
market studies; and economic planning.
<p>
Written and or oral examinations (subject-area examinations) are 
held in the subject-areas of social studies, social- and labour 
market policies; sociology; psychology; psychiatry and social 
medicine; and theories and methods in social work. 
<p>
More examinations may be held within each of the subject-areas or 
several subject-areas may be included in one examination.
<p>
Two assessments are made of the project work (project 
assessments), one in each problem field. The basis of the 
assessment of the project work is the project report and a talk 
about the project work.
<p>
Students must present themselves for examination in subject-area 
examinations and project assessments the first time they are held 
after the teaching and the project work, respectively have been 
completed unless otherwise authorised by the school.
<p>
A students can sit for the same examination 3 times, with - under 
very special circumstances - the possibility of a forth time, and 
only if he or she has been given the mark of 6 or less. The 
highest mark shall apply.
<p>
At subject-area examinations, one or more external examiners are 
present at the examination according to ministerial decision. At 
project assessments there are two external examiners, of which at 
least one comes from a municipal or county administration, and - 
as far as possible - at least one qualified social worker or 
similar.
<p>
The assessment is individual both at subject-area examinations and 
at project assessments. The 13-point marking scale is used for the 
assessment. One mark is given for each subject-area. In the 
project work, one mark is given for each problem field.
<p>
<a name="label38">
<H4>6.3.2.8. Promotion, Educational Guidance</H4>
<p>
Students can only proceed to the next part of the course, if they 
have passed the examinations and tests of the previous part.

After having completed the nursing education, the graduates have 
the right to be granted an authorisation as a nurse. This 
authorisation is granted by the National Board of Health.
<p>
<a name="label41">
<H5>6.3.2.9.2. Social work</H5>

Upon completion of the course, the school issues a diploma, which 
contains the following information: the assessments for the 
individual subject-areas and for the project work, the nature of 
the practical training institution, information on the aims and 
structure of the course, exemptions if any, etc.
<p>
A student who has completed the social work education is entitled 
to use the title of social worker ("socialrådgiver").

<a name="label42">
<H4>6.3.2.10. Openings, Training-Employment Relationship</H4>
<p>
As most of the courses in this area are very practically oriented 
with practical training periods, there are no special measures of 
this kind.
<p>
Openings are advertised in daily newspapers and in the 
professional papers of the individual occupational groups.

<H3>6.3.3. Medium- and Long-cycle University Education</H3>
<p>
This area of higher education covers courses conducted by the 
traditional universities and by higher education institutions with 
university status.
<p>
<a name="label45">
<H4>6.3.3.1. Types of institutions</H4>
<p>
In Denmark, there are a total of 12 institutions offering this 
type of higher education: 5 universities of the traditional kind, 
which offer all or most of the scientific main areas. They are the 
Universities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Roskilde and Aalborg, 
the University of Copenhagen being the oldest (500 years old) and 
Aalborg University the youngest (20 years old); 3 
natural-sciences-based institutions directed at important 
professions: the Technical University (engineering), the Royal 
Danish School of Pharmacy (pharmacology), and the Royal Danish 
Veterinary and Agricultural University (agriculture, horticulture, 
veterinary science, forestry, food science), all of which were 
founded in the 19th century. 3 business schools (Copenhagen, 
Aarhus, and South Jutland) specialising in business economics, 
administration and languages, and finally the Royal Danish School 
of Educational Studies specialising in in-service training and 
graduate studies for teachers of the Danish ["Folkeskole"].
<p>
Common to these 12 institutions is that they must all carry out 
research and offer higher education until the highest academic 
level within their subject-areas.
<p>
The universities in Copenhagen and Aarhus (with 14,750 and 10,100 
active students, respectively) are the largest followed by 
Copenhagen Business school (with 8,500 active students). The South 
Jutland Business School and the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy 
(with 2,250 and 700 active students, respectively) are among the 
smallest institutions.
<p>
In addition to these institutions, there are a number of 
institutions belonging under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs 
offering art education programmes, such as music, architecture, 
visual arts etc.
<p>
<a name="label46">
<H4>6.3.3.2. Admission Requirements</H4>
<p>
The general admission requirements for all the courses under the 
Ministry of Education is the completion of one of the qualifying 
examinations at upper secondary level:
<p>
1) the ["Studentereksamen"]
2) the ["Højere Forberedelseseksamen"]
3) the ["Højere Handelseksamen"], or
4) the ["Højere Teknisk Eksamen"].
<p>
Some schools, e.g. the Royal Academy of Arts and the music 
academies, have their own aptitude tests. But in general, students 
are granted admission on the basis of the average mark obtained at 
their final examination at upper secondary level.
<p>
Finally, there may be a number of special requirements regarding 
certain subjects at high level, work experience etc.
<p>
<a name="label47">
<H4>6.3.3.3. Branches of Study, Specialisation</H4>
<p>
Denmark has recently adopted an Anglo-American structure with the 
introduction of the Bachelor's and Ph.D.-degrees. A university 
course now normally consists of a 3-year Bachelor's degree course, 
followed by a 2-year course leading to the Candidatus-degree 
(Master's level). Three years of supervised postgraduate studies 
after the Master's degree lead to the Ph.D.-degree.
<p>
Most degree courses are self-contained, and students choose their 
field of specialisation when they commence their studies. The 
Master's degree course include half a year's work on a thesis.
<p>
Among the humanities courses, there is also a 4-year degree course 
leading to the cand.phil.-degree and a special 6-year degree 
course leading to the degree of mag.art. Both concentrate on one 
subject.
<p>
At the universities, the above degree courses can be taken in a 
wide variety of different humanities and natural sciences 
subjects, i.e. ["Gymnasium"]-subjects but also many others (e.g. 
eskimology, applied linguistics, phonetics, comparative 
literature, rhetoric, psychology, statistics, actuarial science, 
astronomy, geophysics, meteorology etc.), social science subjects 
(economics, political science, anthroplogy and sociology), law, 
theology, health sciences (medicine, dentistry, human biology), 
communication etc.
<p>
The specialised university-type institutions offer courses leading 
to the above-mentioned degrees in for instance business economics 
and business languages (the business schools), engineering (the 
Technical University and engineering colleges), pharmacy (Royal 
Danish School of Pharmacy), agriculture, horticulture, forestry, 
veterinary science, and food and dairy science (Royal Danish 
Veterinary and Agricultural University) and education (Royal 
Danish School of Educational Studies).
<p>
<a name="label48">
<H4>6.3.3.4. General Objectives</H4>
<p>
The wording of the education orders pertaining to university 
education varies to a great extent, but the meaning is very much 
the same. As examples have been chosen the order on the courses at 
Roskilde University:
<p>
"It is the general objective of the courses at Roskilde University 
to qualify the students to assume occupational functions and 
scientific work within the humanities, natural sciences and social 
sciences main areas."
<p>
and the order on the courses in economics at the universities:
<p>
"It is the geneneral objective of the courses in economics to 
qualify on a scientific basis for employment in the public or 
private sector on the basic of economic theory and methodology."
<p>
<a name="label49">
<H4>6.3.3.5. Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours</H4>
<p>
The curriculum, subjects and weekly workload vary from course to 
course. 
<p>
The weekly workload expressed in the number of hours at school 
ranges from 12 to 40 hours, with the humanities in the lower end 
of the scale and engineering, pharmacy and other courses involving 
laboratory exercises etc. in the upper end of the scale.
<p>
The following courses have been chosen as examples of what the 
content and the organisation of a course may be like: the degree 
course in psychology and the degree course in law. 
<p>
<a name="label50">
<H5>6.3.3.5.1. The Degree Course in Psychology</H5>
<p>
The degree courses in psychology consist of a 3-year course 
leading to the Bachelor's degree, a further 2-year course leading 
to the 'candidatus'-degree (Master's level), and a further 3-year 
course leading to the Ph.D.-degree.
<p>
The courses consist of a number of study units, the number and 
size of which are established in the curriculum.
<p>
The Bachelor's course is a rounded-off course, which gives the 
students basic knowledge of psychology, including developmental 
psychology as well as an elementary introduction to applied 
psychology, research method and presentation of psychology and 
basic qualifications for occupational employment and for 
commencing on the Master's course. The university organises the 
Bachelor's course with a subject supply with options which gives 
the student a choice to finish the course after the 3rd year or to 
seek admission to the Master's course. The Bachelor's course 
comprises the following course-elements: General psychological 
basic disciplines with exercises, general psychology with Bachelor 
assignment, application-oriented psychology, elementary research 
methods, areas of related subjects of relevance to psychology.
<p>
The Master's course is to build on to the Bachelor's course with 
further studies of the applied psychology and its general 
psychological basis with the related method, enable the student to 
independently use psychological knowledge, theory and method when 
analysing and solving problems within public and private 
enterprise, and qualify the student to take part in scientific 
development work. It comprises the following educational elements: 
Applied psychological theory formation and the general 
psychological basis, applied psychological investigation and 
intervention methods, profession and practice, advanced research 
methodology, thesis. The thesis consists of a major independent 
paper which shall document the student's skills in using 
scientific theories and methods in the work with a delimited 
specialist topic.
<p>
<a name="label51">
<H5>6.3.3.5.2. The Degree Course in Law</H5>
<p>
The courses in law consist of a 3-year course leading to the 
Bachelor's degree, a further 2-year course leading to the 
'candidatus'-degree (Master's level), and a further 3-year course 
leading to the Ph.D.-degree.
<p>
The Bachelor's course is a rounded-off course, which gives the 
students basic knowledge of the methods of legal and related 
sciences as well as of central parts of the judiciary system, 
qualifies for occupational employment and forms the basis of the 
subsequent Master's course. The university organises the 
Bachelor's course with a subject supply with options which gives 
the student a choice to finish the course after the 3rd year or to 
seek admission to the Master's course. The subjects of the 
Bachelor's course is distributed on the 3 years of study so that 
the subjects in the 1st year comprises: parts of the law of 
property, parts of public law, family law and law of wills and 
succession. The 2nd and 3rd years of the course comprise the 
subjects of law of property with international private law, 
company law and civil enforcement; public law, international law, 
EU law and parts of civil proceedings; criminal law and criminal 
procedure. In the course of the 3rd year, the students will 
furthermore be given an introduction to the relationship between 
law and society, history of law, general jurisprudence and 
sociology of law. Some of the subjects may be replaced by optional 
subjects with a view to completing the course after the 3rd year. 
The teaching may comprise obligatory exercises, theme reports and 
written papers in the subjects.
<p>
The Master's course is to build on to the Bachelor's course with 
further studies in legal and related subject-areas, enable the 
student to independently use legal knowledge, theory and method 
when analysing and solving problems within public and private 
enterprise, and it is to qualify the student to take part in 
scientific development work. The Master's course is made up of 12 
study units composed by the individual student. One study-unit 
corresponds to 1/6 full-time equivalent. It comprises the 
following subjects: tax law, economics, optional courses, thesis. 
The remaining 10 study units consist of courses and one or more 
written papers which together cover a not too narrowly delimited 
topic-area. Courses and written papers corresponding to 6 study 
units may deal with non-legal topics of relevance to legal work. 
The thesis shall document the student's skills in using scientific 
theories and methods in the work with a delimited specialist 
topic.
<p>
<a name="label52">
<H4>6.3.3.6. Methods</H4>
<p>
Danish university education leaves students free to exercise their 
own initiative. Besides attending traditional lectures, they study 
in small groups where they are expected to contribute actively. 
Part of their studies consists of independent project and research 
work.
<p>
The degree studies offered by the universities in Aalborg and 
Roskilde begin with a one- or two-year basic course which 
qualifies students for a number of further courses of study 
characterised by an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented approach.
<p>
<a name="label53">
<H4>6.3.3.7. Student Evaluation</H4>
<p>
Generally marks are given according to the 13-point marking scale 
indicating the performance of the student:
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>13-10<TH> Very good
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>9- 7<TH> Good
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>6<TH> Satisfactory
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>5-00<TH> Less satisfactory
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<p>
Some examinations only use the assessment of passed/failed.
<p>
The students must obtain at least a 6.0 average in order to pass.
<p>
Students in Danish higher education institutions are not normally 
assessed during the term to the same extent as in some other 
countries. As a new requirement however students admitted after 
1993 must pass an examination after the first year of study. If 
the first-year examination is not passed with at least the mark of 
6, the student will not be allowed to continue his/her education. 
The examination takes place in June with the possibility of 
another try in August or the next year. For further information, 
see [6.3.3.8.].
<p>
Before graduation, the students must pass a number of oral and 
written examinations. These normally take place twice a year in 
January and in May/June. Nearly all examinations - oral and 
written - are conducted with the participation of external 
examiners.
<p>
<a name="label54">
<H4>6.3.3.8. Promotion, Educational Guidance</H4>
<p>
With effect from 15 January 1994 and applying to students who have 
commenced their university studies after August/September 1993, a 
new system of 1st year examinations have been introduced, whereby 
students have to register for and pass an examination before the 
end of the 2nd semester of their studies in order to be allowed to 
continue their studies. The form and content of this examination 
shall be established by the educational institution, and the 
examination is intended to document the student's study aptitude. 
Students who fail this examination may register for a new attempt 
in August, and failing that there is a last attempt at the end of 
the 3rd semester for students who have enrolled and are active in 
the 3rd semester, i.e. a student may go on to the 3rd semester 
without having passed the 1st year test but has to pass the test 
before the end of the semester.
<p>
As regards promotion from the medium-cycle Bachelor's degree 
courses to the long-cycle Master's degree courses, there are 
provisions in the curriculum of the Master's degree course as to 
which Bachelor's courses give admission to it, and as to which 
subjects and levels the student must have in his Bachelor's 
course, and which marks, if any, he must have obtained in order to 
proceed to the higher level.
<p>
All the university-sector institutions have educational and 
vocational guidance counsellors to advise the students.
<p>
<a name="label55">
<H4>6.3.3.9. Certification</H4>
<p>
On completion of the education, the higher education institution 
issues a diploma which shall indicate the examinations taken and 
the marks obtained as well as the title/degree awarded. The 
diploma must contain a description of the course with an account 
of its subject-composition.
<p>
Students, who leave a course without having passed the final 
examination, are entitled to documentation of the examinations 
passed.
<p>
A university may decide that completed course elements which have 
been passed within a given study programme at one university can 
be considered equivalent to corresponding course elements taken at 
other universities. It may in each individual case or through 
general rules established in the curriculum approve that completed 
course elements or parts hereof taken at a Danish educational 
institution or at an educational institution abroad may replace 
course elements or parts hereof taken at its own institution. 
<p>
<a name="label56">
<H4>6.3.3.10. Openings, Training-Employment Relationship</H4>
<p>
With very few exceptions, there are no practical training or other 
provision of a similar nature incorporated in the courses at this 
level.
<p>
<a name="label57">
<H4>6.3.3.11. Special Assistance for Pupils</H4>
<p>
In Denmark, there are no centrally fixed rules for the conditions 
of handicapped students in higher education. The Ministry has 
considered possible changes in the practice in force concerning 
the obligation to grant special educational assistance to 
handicapped students enrolled in higher education. In this 
connection, the educational institutions and the organisations of 
the handicapped have been asked to submit different information, 
but the result of this study is not yet available.
<p>
It is thus up to the individual educational institution to fix 
rules in each individual case, including rules as to the aids 
which can be taken to examinations and to a possible extension of 
the examination time for handicapped students. Under the 
provisions of the University Act, the individual institution is 
fully autonomous with regard to the holding of examinations.
<p>
It is up to the students themselves to pinpoint possible special 
needs for implements and to ask for exemption from the examination 
regulations in force.
<p>
With regard to the financial aspect in connection with the 
acquisition of special implements etc. in order to be able to 
complete a course of higher education, it is the municipality of 
residence of the handicapped student which may cover such 
expenditures.
<p>
The students may furthermore be given aid and assistance from the 
organisations of the handicapped when it comes to acquiring 
special compensatory equipment for handicapped to help them 
through their studies. Further information can be obtained from 
the University of Copenhagen, who as the biggest individual higher 
education institution has the greatest experience with handicapped 
students.
