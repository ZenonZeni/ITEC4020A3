        SMT GOUPIL TAKES CONTROLLING 69% STAKE IN NORMEREL


SMT Goupil SA is bidding to become a dominant force in the
European personal computer market - and meet the challenge of a
Bull SA that has just added Zenith Data Systems to its existing
interests in personal computers. Its latest move is the
acquisition of a controlling 69% stake in Norca SA, the holding
company for ambitious Normerel SA, for about $2.3m. Normerel,
which has spent the past 15 months trying to establish itself in
the US, UK - and Chinese markets, looks for sales of $55m for
1989, and for "satisfactory" profits in 1990. It will become the
OEM arm of SMT - it already supplies Micro Channel machines to
Memorex; SMT also seeks closer ties with Arche Technologies SA,
which has 19% of Norca. Turnover at SMT is running at about
$220m a year.

        OLIVETTI LOOKS TO SHED 500 MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES


Ing C Olivetti & Co SpA faces labour unrest following the
announcement that it wants to cut the workforce at five plants
in Italy by a total of 500 jobs. The firm says the cuts are
necessary because of rapid price erosion in its product lines.
Olivetti also reports that the 18% rise in sales between May and
July has not been sustained, and that growth for the first 11
months of 1989 was 10.7%; as a result it will not meet its
target of profits matching last year's $275m.

        JON SHIRLEY TO QUIT AS MICROSOFT NUMBER TWO IN JUNE


Microsoft Corp shares dipped $1.25 to $85 even on the news that
president and chief operating officer Jon Shirley, the man seen
as a steadying influence on co-founder and chief executive Bill
Gates, is resigning his executive posts at the end of the
financial year in June. Shirley says he wants to devote more
time to his family and his hobbies; his 500,000 Microsoft shares
are currently worth about $40m. Shirley, who joined in 1983
after 25 years with Tandy  Corp, plans to remain as a
director.

                    LOTUS SELLS SIGNAL, QUOTREK


Finding that the hoped-for synergy that would see the numbers
funnelled straight into its spreadsheet programs never
materialised, Lotus Development Corp has thought better of its
diversification into share price delivery systems and agreed to
sell the Signal and QuoTrek services to Financial News Network.
Financial News is 45%-owned by Infotechnology Corp, the New
York-based parent of United Press International and other
electronic publishing ventures. Terms of the sale were not
disclosed, but analysts have valued the business at about $10m.
Lotus's One Source service, which sells electronic libraries of
current, computer-readable data on businesses to professional
investors, is not part of the sale: main users of the services
being sold are small investors.

      ARIX HIT BY COLLAPSE OF OEM UNIX ORDERS FROM UNISYS


That monster OEM contract for multiprocessor Unix machines from
Sperry, continued by successor company Unisys Corp, is turning
into something of a poisoned chalice for Arix Corp. Unisys
accounted for 71% of Arix' $85m business in the year to June
last, but the company now says it has received an order forecast
from Unisys for calendar 1990 that is significantly below
earlier expectations, and account for only 20% of the company's
sales in 1990.Arix is working hard to plug the gap but had not
factored in the accelerated decline in Unisys sales.

       TALKING TACHLIS - 1  YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART THAT
                    MOMMA WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG


Traditionally, a new year begins with solemn resolutions to do
this, become that, or get such and such. In business, the fresh
calendar often coincides with the start of a new budget. Unlike
personal vows, which more likely than not are conceived late on
December 31 and very possibly under the influence, the plans of
an organisation may take as long to formulate as they do to
execute. This does not necessarily make the promises of business
any easier to fulfill. One important measure of a person or
organisation is its resolve. Another, often more telling
characteristic is perseverance when things go awry. There are
many reasons why coping skills fail in the face of the
unexpected. And for every good reason there are a million
excuses. If there is one prominent cause of an individual or
organisation going into crisis in the wake of ordinary
frustration and disappointment, it is self-delusion. For the
most part, kidding one's self doesn't begin with a conscious
effort. Rather, it starts with a garden variety error in
judgement and grows from there. It thrives in the fertile soil
of hubris.

                             Wannabees

It blossoms every time one fails to admit events have taken an
unforeseen turn or that the conditions that exist differ from
those one wished for or anticipated. Eventually, though, it's
time to 'fess up. When hopes, plans and dreams cannot be
realised, only a fresh beginning will do. This requires the
sincere performance of an act that is easy enough before one is
in trouble but damned difficult once problems have grown to
menacing size. That act is called, in Yiddish, talking tachlis.
Talking tachlis means looking at the bottom line, getting down
to basics. While known to the Maccabees - a sensible if overly
goal-directed tribe of years past - talking tachlis seems to be
a lost art among the crowd running things today, the Wannabees.
In corporate life, an avowal of failure is all too often a
career-limiting gesture. Ambition si, admission no.

                           By Hesh Wiener

Post-industrial society has reached a truly appalling state.
It's no longer what you do that counts. It's how you look doing
it. The inevitable result is a world in which positions of
inestimable power are occupied by idiots with great aplomb. Now
please don't get us wrong. We like nice guys as much as the next
person. We want to see them get ahead. But we just can't
persuade ourselves that fooling people is the right thing, even
if it's done in a pleasant manner. Or even when the dissembler
has persuaded himself that he is in fact telling the truth as he
sees it at the time. Listening to a charming, articulate
horsefeathers artist just makes us want to say, loudly and
impertinently, "Hey, cut that out!" This new year, 1990, is
destined for the Guinness Book. A record number of people will
be forced by circumstances not beyond their control to talk
tachlis. Chief among them in our estimation will be IBM's
executives, who will be joined in this sober-minded exercise by
some of their best customers. The process will be quite amusing,
for it will not only involve getting down to brass tacks
collectively, but individually, too. The cold, hard facts are
different for each IBM product line, and for each customer's
situation as well. It would be unfair of us to say that the
3090-J is not a new machine, except for the facts. It's a recast
3090-S, which is a recast 3090-E. And if IBM adds some more
window dressing in the form of a feature or two, that will
hardly make it a different system. It's not necessarily bad that
IBM is selling mainframe customers yet another 3090. The bottom
line - whether the user should move to a J - may have little to
do with a new generation or another set of model designations.
Customers want more bang for the buck, however they can get it.
If the 3090-J offers it, that's good enough. But wait a minute.
Hold the phone. IBM has got to be working on a long-overdue next
generation of large systems. These machines will sock it to the
values of earlier mainframes. So how could anyone be relaxed
about investing in today's IBM iron?

                             Byzantine

What the customer wants is not only lower cost per MIPS, but
also lower cost per transaction. If the user moves to a faster
machine and MVS/ESA, and then finds that the system software
eats more computing power than the new hardware brings to the
table, where's the advantage? Is it really wise for IBM to prove
to the customer that pain is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for gain? If customers want to stay with the Byzantine
systems they're used to, we're sympathetic. But when computers
can no longer give user companies enough extra productivity to
cover their direct costs - let alone help offset inefficiencies
elsewhere in an enterprise - our heart also
goes out to the other people affected. These victims of the
mainframe include user's general managers and the shareholders
at whose sufferance they serve. C'mon, folks. You're all in this
together. How about an end to the conspiracy of silence that
makes every interested party - vendor, user, financing company -
look worse every day? Maybe IBM should acquire Tandem. Maybe we
should all be patient and in a couple of years get Tandem to
acquire IBM. Actually, we'll settle for IBM stealing all
Tandem's good ideas as fast as it can. This leads us to New
Year's Talking Tachlis Prediction Numbers One to Five - but they
will have to wait for another issue.

Bob Senior of Poquet Computer Ltd, in which Fujitsu has a 38%
stake, the rest being owned by management and staff, presented
the overview on portable computers. Poquet claims that its first
product is the smallest fully functional, fully-compatible
MS-DOS portable available. Poquet found that 40% of personal
computer users in the corporate market are always on the move
and that 30% of these would seriously consider buying a portable
personal computer. The Poquet PC is compatible with MS-DOS 3.3,
weighs just 1 lb, and measures 8.75" by 4.3" wide and 0.9"
thick; the two standard AA batteries are claimed to last for 100
hours of continuous use. There is a QWERTY keyboard and 80
character by 25 line screen. It is built around an 80C88 with
512Kb of system RAM and 640Kb of ROM with two slots for 500Kb
RAM or ROM memory cards. These cost around #50 and for the ROM
card version of Lotus 1-2-3 the price is #445. The cards are 68
pin Jieda format and Poquet along with Dupont, Microsoft, Lotus
and others, hopes this will become a standard in the near
future. There is an RS-232 port and input-output expansion bus
compatible with the XT bus, and the Poquet can be linked to a
desktop MS-DOS machine with 5.25" or 3.5" floppy to up- and
down-load files; remote access to files is also possible. A
serial cable will be supplied. Built-in applications include a
diary, calculator, address book and text processing, and
PoquetTalk communications can be used with a modem. The first UK
deliveries are expected in the first quarter of next year and it
will be sold through third parties. Manufacturing capacity at
present is 10,000 Poquets a year, and turnover of $100m is
forecast for 1990. The UK price is #1,300, it will have a one-
year warranty and a 30-day product exchange guarantee. The
seminars on Magnetic Storage Systems and System Backup and
Security were flu'd off, but Greg Carlow of ESS Systems Ltd
commented that the Japanese have vertical recording, which
enables as much as 10Gb to 20Gb to be stored on a 5.25" disk,
ready for release but believes that there is no market demand at
the present time - Japanese manufacturers are still uncomfortable
about pioneering high-end computer technologies before they have
been blessed by US manufacturers.

            AT&T UNIX SOFTWARE SALE TALKS PROGRESS
                  BUT HOW SHOULD IT BE VALUED?


Discussions over the fate of AT&T Co's Unix Software Operation,
which now looks likely to be sold off to companies interested in
acquiring a stake - thus marking the end of the Unix
International-Open Software Foundation conflict that has
dominated the industry this past year - appear to have reached
the point where the main outstanding issue is just how much the
business is actually worth. The problem is that no-one knows how
to assess its value. AT&T has let it be known that it has not
made a profit out of its Unix software activities, and royalty
revenues are currently low, at now more than about $50m
annually. Computer Systems News argues that, comparing the
Operation with companies such as Adobe Systems or Microsoft
Corp, it would have a market value of around $200m, despite its
lack of profits. The true worth of the Operation however, would
be more sensibly valued by its stategic importance to the
interested companies, which apparently include both
Hewlett-Packard Co and DEC. That strategic value would
presumably increase following a cessation of hostilities between
Unix International and the Foundation.

                    WITH VME ACCELERATOR CARD


Megatek Corp, San Diego, California, which takes Sun
Microsystems workstations OEM and revamps their graphics
capabilities, has a new X Window development environment for the
Sun-3 and Sun-4 supporting Open Look, and the XView toolkit. The
X-ccerator VME board uses a Texas Instruments 34020 graphics
chip as a co-processor for the X server, executing on either the
Sun-3's Motorola 60303 or Sun-4's Sparc CPU. This enables
graphics functions to be significantly speeded up while reducing
the load on the CPU. Each board comes with up to 7Mb memory - to
which an extra 4Mb can be added - and supports an additional
keyboard and mouse on the workstation. Multiple X-ccelerator
boards can be configured in a single system, and the price is
#4,000 each. Megatek, which has UK offices in Basingstoke,
Hampshire, offers a range of enhanced graphics systems, including
the recently introduced Sigma 70, IGW 200 and Megatek 944.

      ALCATEL LOOKS LIKELY TO WIN NATIONAL TELECOM AT 50%
                   DISCOUNT TO FLOTATION PRICE


Less than 18 months after its flotation in July 1988, the board
of National Telecommunications Plc has announced that it will be
unanimously recommending shareholders to accept a cash offer
made by Alcatel Business Systems Ltd that values the company at
around #20.4m. Through brokers S G Warburg & Co, Alcatel is
offering 60 pence for each of the ordinary shares in National
Telecom, representing a premium of 22% over the market closing
price of 49 pence on December 21. Alcatel has already received
irrevocable committments to accept the offer from shareholders
accounting for 26.5% of National Telecom Ordinary shares.
National Telecom, which saw pre-tax losses of #1.6m on sales of
#22.4m for the six months ended September 30, started its ascent
to prominence in 1983 as a company with the uninspiring name of
Small Systems Engineering, operating out of a garage in North
London. The quality and competitiveness of the office telephone
exchanges that still, in more sophisticated forms, make up the
hub of National Telecom's business, were enough to tempt Peter
Chamberlain out of British Telecom to head the company, and
after changing the name to the more impressive-sounding National
Telephone Group, he managed to convince John Nash of the venture
capitalists Advent to back the product - Nash had previously
visited the company in 1982 but was put off by the lack of
management skills. With a #1m cash injection and a government
committed to telecommunications liberalisation, things happened
swiftly in the next five years, with subcontraction of
manufacturing to the then Thorn Ericsson, the move to new
offices in London's Docklands, and diversification by acquiring
Ansaphone and by offering complete turnkey packages for
telephone system installation, servicing and maintenance; by
this time, turnover had risen to #19.5m for the year ending
March 31 1988, with pre-tax profits of #2.9m. The hugely
successful flotation in July 1988, which was 17 times
overscribed at a share price of 120 pence, valued the company at
#29.7m and was followed by acquisitions in the UK and the US,
with National Telecom paying #7m for cellular telephone and
airtime supplier Tactico, #3.3m for Solid State Systems, an
Atlanta, Georgia-based designer and marketer of digital PABXs,
and #2.3m for the distributor TVC General Telephones.

                       Lack of accountability

But by May of this year, it became clear that significant
problems had arisen in the key private telephone exchange
distribution business, with lack of accountability at
middle-management level and deviation from group strategy being
cited as reasons for a disappointing net profit of #2.2m for the
year ended March 31 1989, against market expectations of well
over #4m. Since then, those profits have turned into losses, and
even talks with prospective buyers have not run smoothly, with
National Telecom at one point considering a U-turn from its
original plan and going it alone. All this meant that with last
week's bid, Alcatel will be buying at exactly half their 120
pence price at the flotation, and well down on the 153 pence it
hit just over a year ago. For its part, Alcatel sees the
acquisition as providing a UK outlet in the business
communications equipment market using National Telecom's
existing distribution channels; National Telecom has already
stated its desire to be part of a larger group in order to
achieve "its ambitious growth plans" - among which could be the
setting up and running of its own network, an objective hinted
at by Chamberlain in happier days. - Mark John

        ALPHAMERIC CALLS IN THE OCTAGON COMPANY DOCTORS
                     TO ADVISE ON ITS FUTURE


Keyboards, viewdata terminals and data broadcasting company
Alphameric Plc has decided that it needs outside help to get its
business back onto an even keel, and has called in Octagon
Industries Ltd, the Drs Robb Wilmot-Geoff Bristow vehicle backed
by Close Brothers and Octagon Group Ltd, which is already busy
transforming the former Compsoft Plc, now Headland Group, into a
business well-nigh unrecognisable to its founders. Octagon is
conducting a strategic commercial review of all Alphameric's
activities, getting paid #30,000 in cash for the effort, which
should be complete by the end of the month, plus a 3.9% stake in
Alphameric in the form of 880,000 new shares. While the Octagon
team is looking over the business, Alphameric continues its
efforts to find a joint venture partner for its Data Broadcast
and Display Division. The shares, which plunged 25 pence to 34p
after it announced a first half loss of #2.5m (CI No 1,321), are
suspending judgement and currently change hands at 29p.

          CABLE & WIRELESS IN TALKS TO CUT HONG KONG
                    TELECOMMUNICATIONS STAKE


Cable & Wireless Plc has decided to reduce its exposure to the
Hong Kong economy and is negotiating to sell a stake of between
10% and 20% in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd, in which it
currently holds 75%. The talks are with China International
Trust & Investment Corp Hong Kong Holdings Ltd, an investment
vehicle of the Chinese government. Cable & Wireless says that
the talks are at a preliminary stage, and that it definitely
intends to maintain a majority in and management control of the
Hong Kong phone company. If a deal is sealed, the price is
likely to be the average market price of Hong Kong Telecom
during November. At the November average price, 10% would bring
Cables #350m, 20%, #700m. The news was good for a 40 pence-plus
two-day rise in the Cables share price just before Christmas.

        TOTAL SYSTEMS FINDS THE GOING TOUGH AS COMPUTER
                 SERVICES CUSTOMERS CUT BUDGETS


Placed at 85 pence a share in March 1988 (CI No 896), Total
Systems Plc has not had a very happy time as a public company so
far, and the shares are down at around the 22 pence mark - and
the interims announced just before Christmas, showing pre-tax
profit down 22% at just #40,000, are not going to do anything to
revitalise the price. The company, which does about half its
business from custom software, and also does facilities
management and consultancy, ackowledges difficult trading
conditions, as a result of customers cutting budgets. In an
effort to alleviate the impact, Total Systems has been trying to
broaden its customer base, in particular wooing local
authorities, and reports more work for new clients than in any
comparable period. It reckons that it is now in a strong
position to benefit when purse strings are loosened again, and
stresses that the cash resources remain satisfactory and that
net asset value, which includes the freehold of the London EC
headquarters - the company also has a Bristol office - is
strong.

    IBM's HAND-HOLDING SERVICE FOR PERSONAL COMPUTER USERS
                     OUTRAGES ITS US DEALERS


IBM and DEC have an uncanny knack of biting the reseller hands
that feed them with monotonous regularity, and having upset its
AS/400 resellers, IBM has done it again in the US with its new
End User Support programme for personal computer users (CI No
1,326). IBM UK's porte parole on the subject was not available
to say whether there are any plans to introduce the service in
the UK, but in the US, it offers - for what sounds a steep $30 a
month per machine - users of large numbers of personal computers
- which can include Macintoshes and Compaqs or whatever as well
as PS/2s - a high level of handholding that extends to the
generality of third party software as well as the hardware. But
that price - clearly pitched at what IBM thinks the market will
bear, and which must be about what others are charging,
indicates the size of the potential business, and how important
it must be to the companies that currently offer such services.
And those companies are the very ones that IBM should be wanting
to keep sweet as spring water - the dealers that sell its
personal computers. It is already clear that with the rampant
discounting going on in dealer channels (CI No 1,328), there is
going to be a bloodbath in the US computer high street and
no-one is going to be making any money out of hardware, so IBM's
move is seen by dealers already feeling the pain as taking the
very bread out of their mouths by entering the one business
where they can make money, in particular with their precious
large accounts, the very people at which the new IBM service is
primarily aimed. Accor ding to the Wall Street Journal, IBM has
tried to  calm dealers' fears by saying that the new programme
targets only a narrow segment of the personal com puter market -
but it is the very segment of the market that those dealers
that have survived the previous shakeouts have successfully
tapped; and IBM has  had to concede that the new programme may
cost deal ers some business. IBM sells about 80% of its pers
onal computers to dealers in the US and increased its  unit
share of the market to an estimated 35% in the  first 11 months
of 1989 from 31% in 1988, according  to Audits & Surveys Co -
not least because it has  been wooing dealers with attractive
incentives and  offers of training. "This is putting us back
almost  where we were two years ago," Matt Fitzsimmons, a
ComputerLand Corp dealer in White Plains, New York  told the
Journal. "It's really disheartening to be  in competition with a
manufacturer whose product we  sell." But the net effect is
likely to drive dealers  into the arms of other manufacturers,
led by Compaq.

            C E HEATH's DATASURE PICKS UP RIGHTS TO
                  ADVISA PACKAGE FROM RECEIVERS


Advisa Services, in administrative receivership since November,
has sold the rights to Advisa, its financial sales and support
package, to Datasure Ltd, the computer systems arm of C E Heath.
Advisa Services, formerly known as Professional Networks Ltd,
was established in 1986 to develop an expert system-based
financial software package that runs on IBM-compatible personal
computers and laptops (CI No 1,146). Advisa was jointly owned by
the Moorgate Group and Moorgate Computer Systems, but it
experienced financial difficulties and was subsequently
re-financed in 1988 by Moorgate and several other institutions
including Murray Johnstone. However, a combination of high
research and development investment, loan stock, debt related
finance, and rising interest rates continued to make the going
difficult, and the company went into receivership in November.
Deloitte Haskyns & Sells was appointed as receiver, and sold the
rights to the software for an undisclosed sum, despite the
possibility of a management buyout. Advisa is to be operated as
a division of Datasure, and David Lewis, formerly managing
director of Advisa, will continue to head the division. He says
that the company was previously under-funded, and Heath's
acquisition of the rights should put that right.

Peek Plc has reached a conditional agreement to pay $2.5m for
Clearwater, Florida-based software house Porta-printer Systems
Inc, a portable data selection system supplier with a turnover
of around $6m. The acquisition, to be finalised on January 12,
will see Porta-printer acting as a US outlet for Husky Computer
Group, the heavy-duty hand-held computer manufacturer bought by
Peek some two years ago: accordingly, Porta-printer's president,
Bill Newall, will be staying on to report to Andy Faulkner,
managing director of Husky. Meanwhile, Peek has simultaneously
announced the disposal of two non-core businesses: fibre optic
connector division Automatic Connector Inc has been sold for
$1.4m, and probes and test leads distributor Test Probes Inc is
to be conditionally sold for a performance-related sum of
between $2m and 2.5m; both were originally acquired with
Dubilier International in June 1988. All three moves, says Peek,
are in line with its stated intention to concentrate its efforts
on technology aimed at traffic and navigation,
database management, and measurement and control.
