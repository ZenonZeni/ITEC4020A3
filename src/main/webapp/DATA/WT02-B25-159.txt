Inc. would like to thank the Melville Charitable Trust for the generous support 
provided for the preparation and publication of "Opening Doors", and for their 
commitment to addressing the housing needs of people with disabilities and 
people who are homeless.</b>

<hr>
<P>Today, in virtually every part of the United States, people with disabilities are facing an extreme crisis in the availability of affordable housing which meets their needs and desires.  In cities and towns across the country, hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities are living in seriously substandard housing conditions, paying 50%-75% or more of their limited income for rent, living at home with elderly parents, or are being forced to choose between restrictive congregate settings and homelessness. Many others remain in inappropriate institutional settings because there is no housing available to them that they can afford.

<P>What has caused this housing crisis, and what must be done about it?  These questions are clearly addressed  in this report, <I>Opening Doors:  Recommendations for a Federal Policy to Address the Housing Needs of  People with Disabilities</I> prepared by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task Force and the Technical Assistance Collaborative, Inc. The information and recommendations highlighted in this report are designed to guide the development of future federal housing policy and the use of federal housing funds to address the growing shortage of decent, safe, and affordable housing for people with disabilities.  The critical question before us is whether the federal government and the nation's affordable housing delivery system have the will and the commitment to ensure that people with disabilities receive their fair share of federal housing resources, now and in the future.

<P>People with disabilities are currently the population group most in need of federal housing assistance.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <I>1994 Report to the Congress on Worst Case Housing Needs,</I> states that people with disabilities often have multiple housing problems and are the group most likely to live in severely inadequate housing.  Unfortunately, HUD's 1994 report, and a subsequent HUD report issued in March of 1996, <I>significantly underestimate</I> the number of people with disabilities who have priority housing needs.  Since these HUD reports were issued, the CCD Housing Task Force has estimated that over 1.8 million people with disabilities receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits may be in need of federal housing assistance, an estimate that is 10 times higher than recent HUD estimates.

<P>A myriad of factors have contributed to the extreme shortage of affordable housing for people with disabilities, including:
<P> 
<UL>
<LI>a significant reduction in the number of subsidized housing units available to people with disabilities because of the implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies; <P>
<LI>the stigma and discrimination faced by people with disabilities; <P>
<LI>the absence of clear mandates within federal housing programs and policies to expand the supply of federally funded housing for people with disabilities using the full range of HUD's mainstream housing resources; and<P>
<LI>underfunding of federal tenant based rental assistance programs such as the Section 8  program.
<P>
</UL>
<P>The designation of "elderly only" subsidized housing is the most recent factor which has contributed to the critical housing shortage for people with disabilities.  In 1992 and 1996, Congress passed legislation which permits both public housing authorities and HUD assisted housing providers to limit or exclude people with disabilities from living in certain subsidized housing developments by designating that housing as "elderly only."  These housing developments contain virtually all of the studio and one bedroom federally subsidized housing units in the country and represent over two-thirds of the federally subsidized housing resources that low income people with disabilities were eligible to access prior to the passage of this legislation.  

<P>Despite this significant decrease in the supply of subsidized housing available for people with disabilities, until recently, no replacement resources for people with disabilities were authorized by the Congress and as yet no funds have been appropriated to address this loss.  Even more problematic is that HUD included no additional funds for people with disabilities in its Fiscal Year 1997 budget request.

<P><I>"Opening Doors"</I> reports that, from 1993 through the year 2000, the implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies will result in at least a 50% decrease in the supply of HUD public and assisted housing units that were previously occupied by people with disabilities. Overall, based on estimates of the number of people with disabilities who will be displaced from subsidized housing waiting lists, there will be a decrease of at least 273,000 units that would have otherwise been occupied by people with disabilities.  

<P>Using conservative estimates for the rate of turnover in federally subsidized housing units, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that by the year 2000:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<li>At least 110,250 units occupied by people with disabilities will convert to "elderly only" units.
<P>
<li>At least 163,704 people with disabilities on waiting lists who would have otherwise been offered a subsidized housing unit will be told that they are no longer eligible to move in.
<P>
<li>An unknown number of people with disabilities who would have applied for admission to federally subsidized housing will have no other affordable housing options available.
<P>
</UL>
<P>Based solely on the impact of "elderly only" designated housing policies, it is obvious that the supply of housing lost to people with disabilities must be replaced. <I>Where will people with disabilities, many of whom have been on subsidized housing waiting lists for years, find alternative housing resources?  What about people with disabilities who were previously eligible to apply for this housing who will now be turned away? What about people with disabilities living in institutions who should be living in their communities? </I>  Without a clearly articulated federal housing policy and new dedicated resources to address the loss of these units to people with disabilities, their already acute housing problems will undoubtedly increase.

<P>People with disabilities are entitled to an equitable share of federal housing resources, even in an era of federal fiscal constraints.  Therefore, in order to ensure a "fair share" approach, the CCD Housing Task Force has developed the following recommendations to address the acute and increasing affordable housing crisis which confronts people with disabilities:
<P>
<OL>
<P>
<li>Appropriation of new Section 8 tenant based subsidies for people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Redirection of Section 8 turnover to people with disabilities by Public Housing Authorities.<P>
<LI>Redirection of Section 202 funding to the Section 811 Supportive Housing Program for People with Disabilities.
<P>
<LI>Creation of "thresholds" within the CDBG and HOME formula grant programs to promote an expansion of affordable housing for people with disabilities.
<P>
<LI>Reauthorization of the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to expand the supply of affordable housing which can be accessed by people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Maximizing the use of HUD McKinney funding for permanent housing and rental subsidies for people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Creation of  "self-sufficiency" housing policies which target people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Creation of home ownership demonstrations which target people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Creation of incentives for Public Housing Authorities to maintain "mixed" housing.<P>
<LI>Expansion of Fair Housing activities to respond to designated housing implementation.<P>
<LI>Increased flexibility in the Section 811 program, which should be restricted exclusively to qualified non-profit applicants.<P>
<LI>Increased technical assistance and training on affordable housing targeted to people with disabilities, advocates, and service providers, including training on participation in the federally mandated Consolidated Plan process.
<P>
</OL>
<P>A major premise of the Americans with Disabilities Act is that people with disabilities will have the opportunity to participate in and contribute to society.  In order to achieve these goals, people with disabilities must have access to decent, safe, and affordable  housing in our communities and neighborhoods.  We must begin to open the doors!
