<P>
It's the most exciting investment I've come across since I saw my first Xerox copier back in 1957.
Sad to say, I didn't buy Xerox because it seemed "too high." But I'm buying this new Heritage
Stock! 
<P>
Here are a few details:
<P>
It's a small New Hampshire company with $40 million in sales and 120 employees. Not well
known at all. But the firm's crackerjack research team has developed a revolutionary new printing
technology. It's a scientific breakthrough that will lead the printing industry into the 21st century.
<P>
<H4>REVOLUTIONARY, PATENTED PRINTING TECHNOLOGY</H4>
<P>
This patented printing technology uses computer controlled lasers for direct imaging onto
proprietary printing plates.
<P>
Within 17 minutes of starting time, a single pressman can be producing high quality, four-color
offset printing at dramatically lower cost. 
<P>
Any printer using this technology can drastically undercut - by 30% to 40% - the prices of local
competitors who don't use it. 
<P>
And this new technology is environmentally friendly. It uses no films. No hazardous chemicals.
No noxious fumes.
<P>
This little New Hampshire firm has already teamed up with Heidelberg of Germany, the largest
printing machinery manufacturer in the world. 
<P>
As a result, this new technology is being incorporated into the standard printing presses made by
this giant of the printing industry. 
<P>
The small firm I'm recommending gets a $50,000 royalty from each Heidelberg press using the laser
technology, along with $60,000 for each laser imaging system made in New Hampshire for Heidelberg. 
<P>
<H4>HUGE RECURRING INCOME</H4>
<P>
What excites me most about this small company is the big money that will come from recurring
income. 
<P>
You see, the new technology requires special waterless printing plates. And this obscure little
company will furnish every single printing plate, anywhere in the world, on the presses sold by
Heidelberg.
<P>
Result: a huge recurring income stream for this little firm from its patented plates.
<P>
In a way, it's like getting the contract from General Motors to furnish all the gas tanks for autos. . . .
.and also the contract to supply all the gasoline for each gas tank every time it becomes empty.
<P>
<H4>EXPLODING EARNINGS</H4>
<P>
Think of it! These plates sell for around $9.50 each. Each Heidelberg press with this new laser
printing technology uses 10,000 to 15,000 of the special plates a year. And these printing plates
cannot be reused. 
<P>
Here you have another razor/razor blade, camera/film situation. That recurring revenue is the best of
both worlds for any company. 
<P>
Gross plate revenues per printing machine in the field will amount to about $125,000 a year for this
small company. . . . .year after year after year. Multiplying $125,000 times the first 100 presses in
the field yields a revenue of $12,500,000. If half of this is profit, it could contribute about $.90 per
share to earnings. Imagine the potential as more and more of these patented plates are used on more
and more presses. In five or ten years, this firm could be earning $20 or more a share! 
<P>
Earnings will literally explode in the years ahead.
<P>
The stock of this dynamic company is poised for remarkable gains. I believe the stock has the
potential to appreciate in value by 20-fold, 30-fold or even more.
<P>
That's why I call this stock "The #1 Stock for 1997".
<P>
The above details are only part of the complete story of this fast-growing company in the Special
Report you'll receive FREE when you send for our Special Internet Introductory Offer! Do not
miss this investment opportunity! 
<P>
<H4>TERRIFIC BARGAIN</H4>
<P>
This stock is only the beginning. . . . .the first of a select group of winning stocks you can look
forward to seeing in The Cabot Market Letter. Each issue contains two Model Portfolios of
highly recommended stocks from which you can make your selections. 
<P>
And because you're visiting our web site, I'm making you a super introductory offer - a terrific
bargain.  In fact, the super-low cost of this introductory offer could be quickly offset by just a fractional advance in the fast-growing stock I'm advising you to buy!
