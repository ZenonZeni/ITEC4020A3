            <center><h2>DEFICIT WITH CHINA SETS NEW RECORD IN 1995</strong></center></h2>





The United States registered a $33.8 billion deficit in merchandise trade with China during

1995, up from $29.4 billion during 1994, according to the United States International Trade

Commission (ITC) in its report <em>Trade Between the United States and China, the Successor

States to the Former Soviet Union, and Other Title IV Countries During 1995.</em><p>



The ITC, an independent, nonpartisan, factfinding federal agency, prepares quarterly reports

on U.S. trade with the countries that come under the authority of Title IV of the Trade Act

of 1974.  (Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 includes provisions that deny or place

conditions on the granting of most-favored-nation tariff status.)  Report highlights follow.<p>



    Total U.S. merchandise exports to the countries covered by the report increased to

     $15.7 billion during 1995 from $13.1 billion during 1994 and $12.8 billion during

     1993.  Total merchandise imports from these countries rose to $50.7 billion during

     1995 from $42.8 billion during 1994 and $33.7 billion during 1993.  China continued

     to dominate U.S. trade with these partners.<p>



    U.S. exports to China rose to $11.6 billion during 1995 from $9.2 billion during

     1994. During 1995, fertilizers, airplanes, and cotton were the leading items exported

     to China.<p>



    U.S. imports from China increased to $45.4 billion during 1995 from $38.6 billion

     during 1994.  Imports of machinery, mechanical appliances, and electrical equipment

     jumped to $11.4 billion from $8.7 billion.  Major increases also were registered in

     shipments of miscellaneous manufactured articles and footwear.  However, in textiles

     and textile articles, consisting mainly of apparel items, imports fell from $6.1 billion

     to $5.8 billion over the period.  Footwear and toys were the leading imports during

     1995.<p>



    During 1995, Russia was the largest U.S. trading partner among the former Soviet

     republics, followed by Ukraine and Kazakhstan.  The U.S. trade deficit of

     $706.6 million with Russia during 1994 increased to $1.27 billion during 1995.  In

     trade with Ukraine, the U.S. deficit of $150.4 million in 1994 increased to

     $187.1 million in 1995.  In trade with Kazakhstan, a U.S. trade surplus of

     $71.6 million during 1994 changed to a deficit of $46.9 million during 1995.<p>



    U.S. trade with Vietnam more than doubled from 1994 to 1995, showing the

     continuing effects of the end of the U.S. embargo on trade with Vietnam on

     February 3, 1994.  In 1995, Vietnam ranked fourth in U.S. exports to the monitored

     countries, after China, Russia, and Romania, with U.S. exports of $249.6 million.<p>





The report also presents a section identifying the most rapidly growing imports from China

and the extent of their penetration into the U.S. market.  <p>
