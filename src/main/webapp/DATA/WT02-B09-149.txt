<font size=2>The information provided in this portion of the website is derived directly from our Patient Information Handbook.  You will find, herein, information concerning the In Vitro process:  the required preliminary testing, a description of the procedure, the risks and responsibilities of participants, and the andrology/embryology protocol.<p>

Our program began in 1988 at our<A HREF="locations.htm"> Melrose Park, PA</A> office.  In September 1990, we opened a new state of the art IVF laboratory in <A HREF="locations.htm">Marlton, New Jersey</A> and in November of 1991, we merged our two In Vitro Fertilization programs to form the Cooper Institute for IVF in Marlton, New Jersey.  In 1994, we reestablished the Program as the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization, P.C.  We have been a member of The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, (SART), since 1989.  This society is an affiliate of the <A HREF="http://www.asrm.com.">American Society for Reproductive Medicine</A>.  SART's function is to set guidelines and monitor the pregnancy rate of its members in this new and growing field of In Vitro Fertilization.  We perform approximately 550 egg retrievals per year and are considered one fo the largest IVF programs in the United States.
