<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
In the frame of the European standardization work, an ad hoc group
of CEN TC 156, WG2 'Mechanical and natural powered residential
ventilation', is presently working out calculation methods for
the determination of air flow rates for dwellings. A first draft
standard has been prepared and is currently under revision by
the working group and experts of the national CEN shadow committees.
Since the draft with its annexes is rather comprehensive, this
article summarizes only roughly the basic assumptions and the
methods developed so far, without giving the definitions and equations
in detail. For this, the reader is referred to the <A HREF="#References" >draft standard  
</A>.
<H2><A NAME="Content">Content</A> of the draft standard</H2>

<P>
In the draft standard, methods are presented to calculate air
flows for the whole dwelling as well as room air flow rates, both
for single family houses and individual apartments. The methods
may be used for applications such as energy loss calculations,
heat load calculations and indoor air quality evaluations. Natural
as well as mechanical extract and balanced ventilation systems
are considered. Flows due to window opening are also considered,
but only as a single sided effect (no cross ventilation). Depending
on the application and the building type, only outdoor air flow
rates or both outdoor and internal flows are considered. For these
different applications, the same basic methods apply. Nevertheless
the input parameter values have to be selected according to the
requirements set out for the specific application. Informative
annexes of the standard provide
<P>
a) a selection of input data (such as leakage values, wind pressure
coefficients) and guidance for the selection of climatic data
as well as window opening factors
<P>
b) calculation examples for both single and multifamily houses
as well as comparison with results from measurements and calculation
with single and multizone models
<P>
c) a bibliography.
<H2><A NAME="Input">Input</A> data</H2>

<P>
The input data needed for the three calculation methods are largely
identical. Information on the following main aspects of the building,
the dwelling under consideration, the ventilation system and the
external conditions is needed to use the methods outlined in the
draft standard:
<P>
Building and dwelling:
<UL>
<LI>the type of building
<LI>the building height
<LI>the shielding from the wind
<LI>the number of facades of the dwelling which are exposed to
wind
<LI>the air leakage of the dwelling
<LI>the distribution of the air leakage over the envelope
</UL>

<P>
Ventilation system:
<UL>
<LI>the type of system (natural, mechanical extract or mechanical
balanced system)
<LI>the capacity of the ventilation system
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
- natural ventilation openings
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
- mechanical flows
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>the time these provisions are assumed to be used
</UL>

<P>
Finally the climatic data have to be known.
<H2>Calculation method for whole <A NAME="house">house</A> air
flow rates</H2>

<P>
For the determination of the whole house air flow rates, two methods
are given.
<P>
The first method is an explicit method. This means that if all
the input data are known one can carry out the calculation procedure
step by step.
<P>
The second method is the implicit method. This method is based
on a single zone model using a simple flow balance equation that
has to be solved iteratively for the unknown internal pressure.
This solving process normally requires a computer. The advantage
of this method is that the interactions between the wind induced
flow, the stack induced flow and the flows from the mechanical
system are considered correctly. Due to the nonlinearity of these
interactions, the explicit method needs many empirical and approximative
factors to characterize these interaction effects.
<P>
The methods given must be declared as <U>simplified methods </U>when
comparing them e.g. to multizone air flow models available today.
<H3>The explicit method</H3>

<P>
It is assumed, that the air flow is dominated by a single leakage
and that across this leakage there is an effective pressure difference,
which is a summation of windward and leeward pressures. The internal
pressure is assumed to be close to the leeward side pressure.
<P>
Default values for wind pressure coefficients, valid for a wind
sector of approximately 60 degrees to the facade axis, are given
in the standard . The wind direction is not considered more specifically.
<P>
The basic procedure for the calculation is shown in Figure 1.
The total flow is composed of additive flow terms accounting for
the natural flows, the flows of the mechanical system, the flows
due to airing and combustion appliances, and, for apartments,
also for internal flows.
<P>
 
<P>

<P>
Figure 1
<P>
 
<P>
Natural flows due to stack and wind are calculated separately
for leakage and purpose provided openings as a powerlaw function
of the flow coefficient and the pressure. For both stack and wind
induced infiltration flows, an additional factor accounts for
the leakage distribution effects. Ducts are considered for stack
pressures of both infiltration and purpose provided flows.
<P>
For mechanical extract and balanced systems respectively, the
interaction with the natural flows is considered.
<P>
Airing is treated as a single sided, single room ventilation effect
through open window and doors. Cross-ventilation effects are not
considered.
<P>
Combustion induced flows are determined by a factor which accounts
for the fact that a certain proportion of the natural or extract
flow may be used to cover the additional flow needed for the combustion
process, by a factor which considers whether the combustion air
flow is separated from the room (closed system) or not, by the
specific air flow per fuel type needed for the combustion process
and the proportion of time the combustion appliance is activated.
<P>
For the determination of the internal flow in an apartment, information
on the leakage distribution and thus on neutral pressure level
in the staircase is necessary.
<P>
Open/closed ducts and windows, and intermittent operation of the
mechanical system are all considered in the resulting flow by
time weighted addition of the respective flows.
<H3>The implicit method</H3>

<P>
This method is based on a single zone model. This means that the
dwelling is represented by one zone with one temperature and one
pressure value. This zone pressure value has to be determined
iteratively based on a flow balance equation for all flows entering
and leaving this zone. The model is based on the same input parameters
as needed for the explicit method. Nevertheless, individual leakage
values for the facades and the roof have to be determined as percentages
of the overall leakage. Guidance for the selection of cp-coefficient
values at the external nodes is given in an annex of the draft
standard.
<P>
In order to model stack driven flows correctly, distributed leaks
may be modelled by two individual, vertically separated leakages.
This is especially important for natural systems with no vertical
duct.
<P>
The building can be modelled in a more complex way, taking into
account more than two facades. In this case though, the relevant
information on the leakage and wind pressure distribution must
be available. The implicit method can also be applied to apartment
building types.
<P>
Besides the unknown pressure in the zone under consideration,
also the pressure in the staircase is unknown. Therefore, this
building type is normally treated using multizone air flow models.
Nevertheless, two extreme cases can be calculated using the method
in the standard: a) The staircase is not considered as a part
of the building, b) The staircase is considered as a part of the
zone (pstaircase = pzone). Flows for both cases must be calculated
and the results be considered according to the specific application.
<H2>Calculation method for <A NAME="room">room</A> air flow rates
</H2>

<P>
The method gives total flow rates for an individual room in the
dwelling. To perform the calculations, the whole dwelling flows
must be determined first, using the methods outlined above.
<P>
It is assumed that the internal doors to the room under investigation
are closed. More than one room may be considered as one zone if
the internal partitions are removed or the connecting doors open.
<P>
The calculation procedure is applicable to heat load calculations
only, giving conservative high flow rate values.
<P>
For indoor air quality evaluations, information on internal flows
is needed that can only be determined by multizone modelling.
For energy calculations, room air flow values are not considered
to be relevant.
