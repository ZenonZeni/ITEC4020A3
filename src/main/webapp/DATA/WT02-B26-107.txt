<B>With over 20 years experience dealing in South America, the Amazonian Rainforest is Rainforest Bio-Eneregetics second home.  You can be confident that you are connected directly to the Source.  Dealing with importers and middle men is not their way.

 Rainforest Bio-Energetics maintains a permanent company facility in the amazon basin for collection and grading of raw materials.  They are no strangers to being upriver in dugout canoes in the heart of our planet's highest concentration of life energy.
 From ecologically wildcrafting in the Rainforest to the time honored spagyric processing here, they can ensure the quality and safeguard the integrity of the product.  Every step of the process from the Rainforest to the finished product in your hand is totally focused on delivering to you the full and complete phyto-nutrient and bio-energetic properties of the Rainforest.</B>
