MANAGING THE THREAT
OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE

Preventing workplace violence is a critical security function, but
all too often management finds itself scrambling to contain the
damage from workplace incidents, rather than preventing them
before they start.

Workplace violence rarely springs out of nowhere. Nearly all
employer-directed cases of violence begin with a verbal or
physical threat--threats that a well-structured "threat-
management" policy should be able to avert.

Start by putting together a multidisciplinary threat-management
team, says Dennis Johnson, president of Behavior Analysts &
Consultants, Inc., of Stuart, Fla., which conducts corporate
training on managing workplace violence. "Include people who
are trained in workplace violence issues and know the dynamics
of threat management and intervention." A representative team
could include professionals from the security, safety, human
resources, legal, labor relations and medical functions.

The team may also include outside psychologists, consultants,
facilities specialists, or public relations and employee assistance
professionals. This group is responsible for assessing and
managing workplace threats and developing general policy and
procedures.

Most threat-management teams will want to appoint a group
leader, preferably someone with a history of dealing with threats
and security vulnerability. Often the group leader is the security
manager or a human resource expert, says Johnson, coauthor of
Breaking Point: The Workplace Violence Epidemic and What to
Do About It (National Safe Workplace Institute).

Threat management involves two types of assessments--a needs
assessment and a behavioral assessment. The team must be
prepared to evaluate and manage security threats for both. The
needs assessment includes a survey of all physical facilities,
security systems, access authorization programs and any existing
policies relating to security issues.

"You want to assess security vulnerability in terms of the
corporate assets you're looking to protect, past security incidents
and the prevailing environment and social conditions in your
particular industry and community," says Johnson.

For example, "an industry in a high-crime area with lots of
neighborhood violence will affect the attitudes of your workers,"
Johnson says. "Given your labor pool, some employees may
believe that violence is a legitimate form of expressing workplace
frustration."

Significant downsizing also increases your vulnerability. In a
study of 125 workplace homicides, Johnson's firm found that half
of the perpetrators had recently been laid off or terminated in a
downsizing effort.

"Because the lives of so many people--especially men--are
grounded in their jobs, the possibility of losing that anchor in an
economy in which replacement jobs are scarce creates
unbearable stress. That stress may manifest itself in violent
behavior," Johnson says.

Once the critical risk factors are identified, the team should
establish links with outside support functions, such as hospitals,
law enforcement and EAP counselors.

Basically, the needs assessment helps you determine the
readiness of key players to react effectively to specific situations.
For example, asks Johnson "If your beeper goes off, and you
learn that there's a single male perpetrator with multiple
handguns holding your office manager hostage, are you prepared
to handle it? Do you have a plan in place?"

BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT

The behavioral assessment looks at actual incidents or scenarios
of threatening behavior and at the perpetrators themselves. It
evaluates the potential "triggers" that could turn a manageable
threat into violent aggression.

At this stage, the threat-management team  should determine
the circumstances of an incident; whether previous incidents
have occurred; whether the action reflects a pattern; and
whether the person has incurred particular stresses recently
(such as a divorce, a layoff, a death in the family).

"Whenever a person engages in violent behavior, he or she has
chosen aggression over other alternatives," Johnson notes. To
understand what led to that choice, the violence should be
considered in terms of the contributing factors.

In framing the specific threat-management policy, the group
must determine the extent to which supervisors and employees
will receive training in such areas as conflict resolution, stress
management, employee counseling, dealing with difficult people,
etc.

"Many companies believe that controlling workplace violence is
everyone's responsibility and thus choose to extend awareness
training to all employees," Johnson says.

Johnson suggests combining threat management with other
policies, such as Fitness for Duty or Drug-Free Workplace
statements. Johnson favors a catchall "Fair Treatment for
Others" policy, because it can address the importance of
respecting differences in religious, philosophical or personal
beliefs--any of which may trigger aggression.

Without exception, every policy must clearly establish a zero
tolerance for threatening behaviors, and Johnson emphasizes
that it be conveyed in both writing and in practice. "It doesn't
matter if it's a verbalized threat, an emotional outburst,
unwanted romantic overtures or physical intimidation. Any
conduct that has the potential to harm or interfere with the
actions of others should be investigated."

Why? Because beyond an actual threat is the perception of what
the company considers threatening. If employees witness and
report threatening behavior, but management takes no action to
stop it, "people may start to think that grabbing or harassing is a
legitimate form of conflict resolution."

Many times there is no real danger--men often slap each other
on the back, for example, but if a male employee who's had a
hard day shoves a female co-worker, or blows up at her in the
parking lot, it may be another story. Perhaps the two know each
other and the particular situation is harmless.

Still, Johnson encourages talking to all individuals involved in a
reported incident, including any third-party witnesses, "so that
employees realize what is and is not appropriate workplace
behavior."

The threat-management plan should spell out who  receives
reports of threatening behavior (often this is the direct
supervisor or the security manager) and how those reports are
delivered--in person, in writing, via a phone call to a outside
hotline, etc. "The method for handling complaints varies among
companies, depending on the corporate culture," says Johnson.

The plan should also outline procedures for recognizing
potentially threatening behavior. Red flags include chronic
absenteeism, erratic work patterns, difficulty meeting deadlines,
notable changes in personal appearance or conduct, unwarranted
anger or irritability and difficulty accepting criticism. The
frequency, duration and effect of the behavioral change may all
affect the perception of its seriousness. Nonetheless, all
questionable behaviors warrant close monitoring.

If, upon evaluation, you decide that action is required, many
companies will bring in an independent, unbiased consultant to
conduct a "dangerousness assessment," says Johnson. That
process monitors warning signs and can pinpoint whether there
is a clear and immediate threat to identifiable targets.

ATTITUDE SURVEYS

Attitude surveys are a relatively benign way to gauge employees'
perceptions of the organization. "They're a kind of 'early-warning
system' that reveals trends and changes in the mood and
behavior of employees," Johnson says. Surveys involve one-on-
one, confidential interviews ("usually 20- to 40-minutes") with
randomly selected employees. Some employees are also asked to
fill out confidential questionnaires.

"Attitude surveys help us tap into attitudes and show what
barriers or constraints exist in the workplace. They help identify
strengths and weaknesses, and we often can find out if there are
any illegal or unprofessional practices, as well as general security
vulnerabilities."

Johnson claims that in more than a decade of working with
threat-management programs, his firm has never yet conducted
an attitude survey that did not lead to substantive change. He
encourages companies to share feedback from the surveys with
employees, who often can help solve internal problems and
analyze what might be done to achieve a safer work
environment.

 The goal, Johnson says, is to generate two-way communication
and to help people learn to recognize and deal with signs of
trouble before they escalate out of control.

WORKPLACE HOMICIDES IN 1992

A new analysis of deaths in the workplace finds homicide
accounts for close to one in five of all on-the-job fatalities.
Based on the 1992 nationwide Census of Fatal Occupational
Injuries, the analysis by Janice Windau and Guy Toscano of the
Office of Safety, Health and Working Conditions at the Bureau
of Labor Statistics found:
  *  Homicide accounted for 17
percent of the 6,083 fatal work injuries in 1992. More than half
the victims were 25 to 34 years old.
  *  Male workers comprised 83 percent of the 1,004 victims of
homicide. For men, homicide ranked just behind motor vehicle
accidents in the number of work-related fatalities. For women,
homicide was the leading cause of death.
  *  Most homicides resulted from gunshot wounds during a
robbery attempt between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. Robberies often
occurred while  employees were locking up at night or making
money drops or pickups.
  *  Business disputes accounted for 261 deaths, 45 of which
involved a current or former co-worker, and 35 of which
involved a customer or client.
  *  Workplace homicide is primarily an urban problem, with
nearly half of the incidents occurring in the retail trade.
Convenience stores, restaurants, bars and gas stations were
hardest hit. One-sixth of the homicides occurred in service
industries, including guard and armored-car services, hotels and
motels, and health and educational services. Taxicab companies
and police protection also were  affected.
  *  Occupations incurring 50 or more homicides in 1992
included supervisors and sales proprietors, taxicab drivers and
chauffeurs, cashiers, managers of food and lodging
establishments, food preparation and service occupations, police
and detectives, and private guards.

INFORMATION NETWORKS FACE MOUNTING HACKER
INTRUSION

Few corporate communications networks are safe from
electronic intrusion. Hackers who once engaged in mere high-
tech mischief are now probing new digital communications
technologies for flaws that may yield big financial gains.

However, private network operators and telecommunications
companies can take steps to close security loopholes, according
to network security experts speaking  at the International Virus
Prevention and Information Security Conference, sponsored by
the National Computer Security Association in Arlington, Va.,
March 31.

Ted S. Phillips, a telecommunications security associate at Booz,
Allen & Hamilton Inc., believes domestic and international
telecommunications companies and long-distance carrier
networks are increasingly at risk for computer crimes. Open-
systems architecture such as Signalling System 7 and advanced
intelligent network technology are also vulnerable. In the new
systems, carriers and users share responsibility for
administration, network elements interconnect, and customer-
premises equipment ties more closely to the public switched
network, all of which heighten network vulnerability.

To an intruder, multiple points of entry into telecommunications
networks "raises the number of attack vectors," Phillips says.
"Hackers can easily enter a company's system via an X.25
network or a dial-in modem."

Once inside the system, hackers can disrupt network service and
obtain or modify data. In extreme cases, they have been known
to steal communications equipment and software manuals from
company premises and use confidential data for extortion or
fraud. However they compromise a system, hackers cause
companies to lose revenue and investor confidence, and may
even threaten public security by tampering with emergency
services communications. Yet hackers rarely destroy the systems
they have entered. They "want to keep systems up and running,"
Phillips says, so they can continue to grab information and
remain inconspicuous.

SMOOTH OPERATORS GLEAN VALUABLE PASSWORDS

Phillips notes that hackers often obtain their best information by
"social engineering"--basically, smooth talking office personnel
into releasing passwords and access codes. "This is a real threat"
to security systems, he says, but there are ways of protecting
systems.

"Keep control of internal 'phone books' that list passwords,"
Phillips advises. "Shred documents that contain access codes.
Train secretaries to question people who walk in the door asking
for information. And put locks on your dumpsters." Believe it or
not, trash bins are prime targets for hackers seeking manuals
and documents that contain sensitive information.

Also speaking at the conference, Hank M. Kluepfel, managing
director for government accounts at Bellcore, encouraged system
users to discard easily discernible passwords based on common
names and to use combinations of alpha and numeric characters
instead.

For example, a user named Mary Elizabeth could use the
corresponding numbers on touch-tone telephone keys for the
name "Beth," plus the letter J for the month of her birthdate-
-2384J--or the corresponding letters for her house address, plus
the number 2 for her two children, for example.

Companies can further minimize the risk of intrusion by creating
security guidelines and responsible safeguards for staff. "Let your
employees know what is expected of them and how the system
works," Kluepfel says. He adds that many companies keep their
employees in the dark about security for fear that a disgruntled
but knowledgeable employee will wreak havoc on the system. Or,
they fail to penalize employees who ignore simple guidelines.
Kluepfel also urged companies and telecommunications
providers to exchange information on hackers and their tactics.

Companies should also demand better security from equipment
vendors. "Let vendors know what you expect," Kluepfel says.
Customer input will force equipment vendors to put security
concerns into the product development stage, and will help
companies avoid the time and often damaging expense of
implementing such mechanisms retroactively.

When operating a network, Kluepfel advises companies to "think
like a hacker" by noting the most secure and the most vulnerable
locations in a system, as well as the most valuable information,
which is most likely to be stolen if not protected.

TACO BELL IN HOT SALSA OVER HOLD-UP

After Claudia Piagentini was fired for refusing to report for her
night shift after a robber held a gun to her head at a Northern
California franchise, she sued Taco Bell for failing to provide a
safe workplace.

The woman's suit contends that her boss agreed she could come
off the night shift and work days for one month after the
midnight robbery in March of 1993. But management changed
its mind  later and told her to report as usual.

Piagentini said she couldn't comply, as she was still too shaken
up from the trauma of looking down a gun barrel. She was fired
for her willful misconduct. The suit asks that the franchise
owner, Dolan Foster Enterprise, Inc., be ordered to pay
Piagentini's lost wages and an unspecified amount for failing to
provide a safe workplace.

BODYGUARDS: PERSONAL PROTECTION ON THE RISE

Being a bodyguard means expecting the unexpected, whether it's
protecting business executives and political figures, or ushering
movie stars and sports heros through swarming paparazzi. Job
duties may include hovering nearby through interminable
meetings, elbowing paths through bustling airports, attending
high-profile parties, stoically keeping watch through long nights
without sleeping, chauffering protectees around town, even
running errands that ought to fall under someone else's job
description, but don't. It's a job that offers some excitement--and
a lot of boredom.

Large cities naturally have the greatest call for bodyguards--New
York City, Los Angeles and Washington, followed by Chicago,
tend to require the most, says Richard Ward, a former New
York City detective, now a chancellor at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. "You've got sports figures, entertainment
people, organized crime figures who require [protection], and
business people with money who feel they need someone around
them."

Ed Scheu of Thompson Professional Services in Chicago,
recently guarded an executive whose company had laid off
several hundred employees. "He was the No. 2 man with the
company. He had gotten multiple threats, letters, phone calls to
his house," recalls Scheu. "One of them said to his wife, 'We're
going to get that [expletive] you're married to.'"

With workplace violence rising, so will the perceived need for
bodyguards, predicts Scheu. Where does one go to find a
bodyguard? Word of mouth, the Yellow Pages and newspapers
are good places to start. Many companies that sell or
manufacture security alarms, such as ADT or Honeywell, can
also recommend protection services. However, "most CEOs and
corporate presidents have a known network they can call on for
protection," says Scheu. "A lot of paranoia prevails in these
upper echelons; once one has been threatened, he lets the others
know and it heightens the paranoia."

Bodyguards come from all walks of life: former FBI or Secret
Service agents, ex-Marines, retired or moonlighting police
officers, private investigators, corporate security guards, etc.
Most are men, but increasing numbers of women are getting into
the field.

Fortunately, you need not look like Shawn Eckardt to be a
bodyguard. In fact, brains are far more desirable than brawn
(testimony to Eckardt's flub-up in "protecting" Tonya Harding).
"The most effective bodyguard is someone who's low-key,
unobstrusive and meshes with the environment," says Branch
Walton, a 21-year veteran of the Secret Service in Springfield,
Ill.

And pay? "A mug off the street will probably make from $20,000
to $30,000 a year," says Ward. "Generally, a professional is going
to make between $50,000 and $100,000."

Becoming a bodyguard requires no formal training, but would-be
protectors can pick up training tips--such as how to placate
aggressive autograph seekers or fend off would-be knee
knockers--at police departments or schools like the Executive
Protection Institute, headquartered in Berryville, Va. EPI has
branches nationwide and offers a variety of classes, including
criminal education and law enforcement litigation.

Some universities, such as the University of Illinois at Chicago,
are starting to offer short courses on personal protection and
physical security. Ward recently asked Scheu to conduct a two-
day course on security issues for Chicago-area law enforcement
personnel.

"Basically," however, Ward notes, "anyone can hang out their
shingle and say they're a bodyguard."

QUESTIONS ABOUT EVERYDAY SECURITY PROBLEMS

Q:  Can old electronic communications can be used against us?
My bank terminated an employee for stealing money, but she
claims she found a year-old e-mail message that defames her
character and reads "Get rid of her." Are we required to let
investigators search our computer disks and backup tapes?
A:  Yes, if you are sued or formally charged with criminal
violations, a court order can force you to open your electronic
files. Your former employee has a tough case to prove, but
"attorneys are starting to aggressively target electronic data," says
John Jessen, of Electronic Evidence Discovery, a Seattle
investigation firm.

Electronic mail should not be considered a secure medium for
sharing sensitive data about company plans and actions. Jessen
has worked on cases in which investigators recovered supposedly
deleted e-mail messages that used descriptive expletives to attack
employees' personalities instead of their work performance. In
one instance, the plaintiff settled out of court for $250,000.

In 1993, a San Francisco federal district court ruled that
companies under criminal investigation should readily provide all
company-related electronic files to prosecutors. Not turning over
files at once could be an offense itself.

Advice:  Tell employees what communications can be used
against them in court. Back up and label data carefully. And,
don't send anything via e-mail that you wouldn't broadcast over
a loudspeaker.

Q:  One of our employees has received anonymous e-mail
messages that are racist and hostile. His boss also has received
messages that criticize his managerial skills and question his
competency. Trouble is, we don't know who's sending the
messages. What can we do?

A:  Most electronic messaging software requires sender
identification, but a few products do allow anonymity. One
rationale for the new software is that unidentified messages may
promote interoffice discussion of formerly taboo topics. An
aerospace manufacturer claims it's done wonders for getting his
employees to brainstorm ideas. But the flip side is the problem
you describe.

One solution is to pull the plug on your global e-mail system and
rewrite your network software to enable tracking of all
communications. Further, at least one Fortune 1,000 company
now has a policy forbidding unidentified harassment and hostile
criticism.

Another solution is to follow the lead of Internet, the world's
most popular network for sharing electronic intimacies and
whistle-blower communiques. Internet requires a "return
address" on all messages. However, it also allows users to send
messages to a "remailer"-- a message "launderer" that strips out
the original headers and inserts its own. Perhaps an electronic
middleman is the answer.

Q:  Must offensive conduct seriously affect an employee's
psychological well-being or cause actual injury in order to be
unlawfully discriminatory? And, if so, how do we measure such
injuries?

A:  A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled late last year in
Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. that Title VII provisions come
into play long before offensive conduct leads a person to a
nervous breakdown or other serious malady. But determining the
scope of injury is less than clear. An obnoxious or insensitive
comment may give one person an annoying headache, while
sending another running to a psychiatrist for Valium. Which
victim has the stronger case?

The Court ruled that if a "reasonable person" could perceive a
work environment to be hostile or abusive, that person does not
also have to prove the conduct was psychologically harmful.
"Injurious" conduct may include attacks based on gender, race,
color, religion or national origin and, most likely, disability and
age.

Other factors that may be considered are the frequency of the
conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or
humiliating, whether it unreasonably interferes with the victim's
work, and whether it affects the victim's psychological well-being.

In light of the ruling, employers should investigate all complaints
of inappropriate conduct and may want to broaden their
harassment policies.

Q:  Our top car salesman sexually assaulted a customer while on
a test drive. He was recently convicted on criminal charges, but
the company has now been sued for negligence in hiring. The
customer claims we failed to do a pre-employment criminal
investigation, which would have shown the salesman was an
offender. Are we liable?

A:  Some courts have ruled that employers can be held liable for
an employee's actions if the company had any indication "by
reason of past conduct, bad temper or otherwise" that the person
was potentially dangerous.

However, while "a presumption exists that an employer has used
due care in hiring," most courts say that unless compelling
evidence indicates a criminal investigation is appropriate,
employers have no legal obligation to conduct such background
checks.

A North Carolina Court of Appeals dismissed a similar case,
ruling that companies cannot be held responsible for an
employee's actions that occur beyond the scope of employment
or are "designed to carry out an independent purpose." In your
case, the salesman's conducted clearly violated the bounds of his
duties and the company's expectations.

CLIPPER CHIP BATTLES STORMY SEAS

The Clinton administration's decision to approve the
controversial Clipper encryption device continues to make waves.
Clipper is a computer chip that makes telephone traffic
indecipherable to eavesdroppers, but allows the government a
"trap door" so that investigators can access decrypted Clipper
calls.

During a public comment period, the administration received
331 letters and comments; all but two criticized the technology.
Last month a poll conducted for Time Inc. and CNN found that
80 percent of the 1,000 respondents oppose Clipper and would
rather protect the privacy of phone calls than allow police to tap
wires.

The FBI insists that the optional system grants authorities access
"only when there's probable cause that there's criminal activity"
taking place on scrambled lines.

Yet at least 45,000 opponents have signed an electronic petition
against the new policy, saying they worry more about
unscrupulous public servants than they do about "bad guys"
trying to eavesdrop and/or steal data.

At one point during the recent Computers, Freedom and Privacy
Conference in Chicago, keynote speaker David A. Lytel, a White
House technology expert, looked around in exasperation and
asked, "How many people here fear they are at greater risk from
government abuses of power than criminal activity?" Most in
attendance raised their hands.

A  House-Senate panel plans hearings on the technology later
this month.

VOICE AND DATA RECOVERY

IBM Corp. and AT&T's Global Information Solutions recently
agreed to market a joint disaster recovery service for voice and
data communications. In the event of a power outage, bomb
threat, fire, severed cables or other disaster, the companies will
support each other's disaster recovery customers.

"This agreement allows us to combine AT&T's expertise in data
and voice communications with IBM's disaster recovery expertise
in the computer environment," says Bob Richards, general
manager of AT&T's business recovery group. The joint venture
will provide an "efficient and economical way to offer complete
disaster recovery services."

Both companies will have 24-hour access to the other's business
recovery centers. IBM has 17 U.S. recovery sites offering
equipment, advanced telecommunications support and specialists
in networking, systems management and programming.

AT&T currently has a single crisis center in Rochelle Park, N.J.,
the first of several sites planned. In the event of disaster,
metropolitan New York City customers can relocate their
employees and critical business functions to the facility within
two to four hours, where they're provided 200 computer-ready
workstations, desks and phones.

The service allows for fully restored voice and data
communications, round-the-clock access to stored records, plus
vault storage for secure, off-site data storage.

PERSONAL SECURITY ALERT

Safe & Sound Homecare Inc. of  Lincoln, Neb. has developed a
wireless, portable security sensor that can quietly warn a security
manager of a remote perimeter violation. The system consists of
a cordless motion detector that fits any door jam, a plug-in
transmitter /recharger and a small personal pager that beeps or
vibrates when activated and conveniently clips to a belt or fits in
a pocket.

The sensor trips a remote alarm, so the security violator is not
alerted, and the appearance of security personnel seems
coincidental. The portable system can be moved within a facility
as needed. The base unit plugs into any standard electrical outlet
and installs in  minutes. Originally designed for keeping track of
small children or the elderly, the system has practical business
purposes as well. $1,995 per unit. For more information, call
800/328-0526.

PROTECT YOUR FAXES, ETC.

As the need to scramble and encrypt phone and fax messages
increases, so does the security risk  of computer modems. Given
the ease with which a line's integrity can be compromised, all
data transmitting over that line represents a possible loss.

Discreet Electronics and Security Inc. of Chicago has developed
an encryption device that involves installing a small box on the
sender's and  the receiver's line ( phone, fax or modem).

The user "signs in" to establish a link with the receiver. When
activated, the device randomly generates encryption codes that
change every 1/10th of a second. Vault security is also available
to ensure specific parties receive private messages. Depending
on the level of security and the type of communication system,
prices range from $2,000-$4,000 per package. Contact Michael
Pinsker, 312/664-7797.
