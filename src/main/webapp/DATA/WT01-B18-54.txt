<B>Dear Prospective Graduate Student:</B>
<P>
The Department of Marine Science of The University of Texas at
Austin offers programs of study leading to the M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees in marine science. Graduate students usually begin their
academic program with coursework in the summer semester in Port
Aransas. They continue their coursework on the Austin campus before
moving to The University of Texas Marine Science Institute at
Port Aransas for specialized advanced courses and thesis or dissertation
research. Students are required to take core courses in the following
subdisciplines: marine biology, marine chemistry, marine geology
and physical oceanography.
<P>
The research and teaching interests of Faculty/Staff in the Department
of Marine Science/Marine Science Institute are primarily focused
in a wide range of marine environments but several interdisciplinary
marine programs are also available. The research programs of Dr.
Behrens and Dr. Maguire are located at the main campus in Austin
whereas those of the other faculty/staff are based at the Marine
Science Institute at Port Aransas which is on the Gulf coast near
Corpus Christi. The Marine Science Institute provides opportunities
to study living organisms in the laboratory and under field conditions.
A wide variety of environments are readily accessible, such as
the pass connecting Corpus Christi Bay with the Gulf of Mexico,
the continental shelf, and many bays and estuaries, including
brackish estuaries and the hypersaline Laguna Madre. Extensive
wet laboratory facilities with running sea water are available
for maintaining marine organisms. There are also specialized wet
laboratories and environmental chambers for mariculture, physiology,
behavior and toxicology research. 
<P>
Vessels include the R/V LONGHORN, a 105-foot research vessel with
navigation and laboratory capabilities for most research projects;
the R/V KATY, a 54-foot boat with dredge and trawl equipment for
collection of specimens; and a fleet of smaller boats for use
in bays and estuaries.
<P>
Modern laboratories are equipped to study vertebrate and invertebrate
biochemistry, physiology, behavior and ecology; viral, bacterial,
algal and seagrass physiology and ecology; mariculture; and marine
chemistry and biogeochemistry. The library has extensive holdings
in marine science and related disciplines. Remote terminals provide
direct access to the mainframe computers on the Austin campus.
<P>
Research and teaching assistantships and E.J. Lund Scholarships
are the major sources of financial aid for graduate students.
Currently 28 students are enrolled in the graduate program of
the Department of Marine Science. University apartments are available
for students use during their stay in Port Aransas.
<P>
Additional information on our graduate program can be obtained
by calling (512) 749-6721 or e-mail gradinfo@utmsi.zo.utexas.edu.
Prospective students should contact individual faculty members
for further details of their research programs.
<P>
Graduate Adviser
