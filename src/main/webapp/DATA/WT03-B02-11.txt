DOJ GIVES SEAL OF APPROVAL TO THREE PROVIDER NETWORKS

Federal antitrust authorities have given the okay to three
provider networks, including one that would represent nearly
50% of the dermatologists in its market.

South Carolina dermatologists will be allowed to form a
network to contract with managed care organizations to
provide skin services currently being provided by
internists, general and family practitioners and other
specialists.  In two other decisions, DOJ okayed a plan by
Florida dermatologists, plastic surgeons and
dermatopathologists to form a network and agreed to allow a
Georgia foot care network to act as an intermediary for
soliciting and managing managed care contracts between its
members and third-party payers.

DOJ says the non-exclusive South Carolina dermatology
network will allow 85 board-certified dermatologists to
contract with managed care plans at competitive rates for
dermatologic services commonly provided by other types of
doctors.

Based on the assumption that the number of network
dermatologists in any local market will not exceed 30% of
all doctors available to provide the same kinds of services,
the Justice Department's antitrust division says it is
unlikely that network members would attain market power or
cause anticompetitive effects.

Even with 44% of market, network earns DOJ okay

In another ruling, the antitrust division last month decided
to allow a group of south Florida dermatologists, plastic
surgeons and dermatopathologists to form a joint network to
provide comprehensive services to third-party payers.

Dermnet Inc. will provide services in Dade, Broward and Palm
Beach counties.  "By offering more choices and greater
efficiency, Dermnet might inject a healthy dose of
competition in these markets," said Anne Bingaman, assistant
attorney general for antitrust.

Bingaman's letter said that Dermnet's operations, while
representing around 44% of board-certified dermatologists in
the area, are not likely to result in anticompetitive
effects.  The network presents sufficient safeguards, she
writes, to prevent threats to competition for dermatology
services in the market.

Dermnet's members will share substantial financial risk
through capitation, and the network will be non-exclusive,
Bingaman says.  In addition, large healthcare payers in the
area expressed no competitive concerns about the proposal,
instead viewing it as a possible way to enhance efficiency,
she says.

A Georgia foot care network will be allowed to act as an
intermediary for soliciting and managing managed care
contracts between its members and third-party payers under a
third proposal granted approval by DOJ.

The proposed non-exclusive network will be open to any
member of the Georgia Podiatric Medical Association.  The
network, which will be called Georgia Preferred Podiatric
Medical Network, represents 92 of the state's 212
podiatrists.

The department said the proposed activities are not likely
to be anticompetitive because the network will function as a
facilitator of managed care contracting between its members
and payers.  The network will not negotiate fees on behalf
of its members, and members will be prohibited from
discussing contract terms among themselves.

In addition, the department said the discussions that payers
may request with the network's agent concerning non-price
issues may be efficiency-enhancing, because they may assist
health plans in developing effective standards of care and
cost controls.

HOSPITAL SATISFACTION WITH JCAHCO IMPROVING, ACCORDING TO
AHA

Overall hospital satisfaction is increasing with the on-site
survey process of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organization, according to the second in a series
of national opinion polls conducted for the American
Hospital Association.  Satisfaction with the pre-survey
process increased as well.  But hospitals reported
increasing dissatisfaction with the time needed to get
written accreditation reports after their on-site surveys.
The poll, conducted by the National Research Corp. of
Lincoln, Neb., was mailed in November to 660 hospitals that
had been evaluated by the Joint Commission from May 20 to
Sept. 30, 1995.  Three hundred and thirty-four responded.
Data for the first poll in the series was gathered in
August.  The polls seek to identify the reasons why
hospitals want Joint Commission accreditation; to assess
hospitals' level of support for the accreditation process
and to learn which areas of that process need improvement.
Contact AHA at (202)638-1100.

FTC DECIDES TO DROP CHALLENGE OF MISSOURI HOSPITAL MERGER

The Federal Trade Commission unanimously decided to drop its
case challenging the merger of two Missouri hospitals on
antitrust grounds.  "The decision not to pursue the Freeman
and Oak Hill hospitals case marks the first time that the
FTC has used the new rule it adopted to review and dismiss a
pending case after reconsidering it," says Thomas Campbell,
a hospital antitrust attorney representing the Joplin
hospitals.  The five FTC commissioners unanimously announced
the dismissal of the case after being denied a preliminary
injunction Nov. 1 by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis.  Previously, U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple in
Kansas City issued an opinion and, after holding an
evidentiary hearing in Joplin, concluded that the FTC's
evidence did not meet the requirements for a preliminary
injunction.  Contact Campbell at (312)245-8425.

TENET FORMS EQUIPMENT-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Tenet Healthcare Corp., Santa Monica, Calif., has formed a
comprehensive equipment-management program projected to save
the company more than $13 million over the next three years.
The program, which oversees all equipment-maintenance
contracts -- will be implemented in the company's 75 acute
care hospitals.  The program will employ three major
strategies to reduce costs:  development of a centralized
database for all existing major maintenance contracts;
moving away from long-term, noncancelable agreements and
development of uniform terms and conditions for all
maintenance contracts; and assignment of selective equipment
maintenance to one of two independent service organizations.

JOHNS HOPKINS, HUMANA TEAM TO BUILD MD. MCO NETWORK

Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins HealthCare will team with HMO
giant Humana Inc., Louisville, Ky., to capture more managed
care business in Maryland and build the foundation for a
five-state health plan.

The alliance gives Johns Hopkins' network building efforts a
big boost, and should mean more managed care tertiary care
business for the system's flagship, Johns Hopkins Hospital.

For Humana, the deal could jump-start its entry into the
wider Maryland market, where its business now is limited to
metropolitan Washington, D.C.

Humana's subsidiary Humana Group Health Plan Inc.,
Washington, will soon move into the Baltimore market.  The
HMO plans to follow that growth with a push into Delaware,
Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Deal means more tertiary care business for Johns Hopkins

Johns Hopkins has much to gain, too, says Michele Deverich,
vice president of product and network development for Johns
Hopkins HealthCare, notably increased business in tertiary
care.

Humana will use and expand physician networks Johns Hopkins
has established, such as pediatrics and cardiology, and will
work with the health system to form other provider and
ancillary networks.

"Every bit of market share Humana garners will flow through
our network, and all tertiary care is pointed in the
direction of Hopkins," Deverich says.  With the network that
Humana and Hopkins will develop, the HMO will never need to
send a patient out of that system, she predicts.

Partnership boosts Humana's metro D.C. efforts

The two partners could prove to be a good match.  Two years
ago, Humana took over the Washington-based Group Health
Association, one of the oldest HMOs in the country.  With
the rechristened Humana Group Health's enrollment stalled at
around 120,000 members since the purchase, Humana is ready
to boost its fortunes through expansion outside the
Washington market.  And Hopkins sees an opportunity to grab
more primary care business for the provider networks it's
building.

"We realized we needed a strong presence in the primary care
market," says Deverich.  But "this is not an effort to get
bread-and-butter care into Johns Hopkins.  Our goal is no to
drive every appendectomy and normal [baby] delivery to Johns
Hopkins."  Primary care will be channeled to a nine-hospital
Maryland network, Atlantic Health Alliance.

MD.'S MATERNITY LOS LAW ISN'T BOOSTING HOSPITAL STAYS, SOME
SAY

Maryland's pioneering mandatory maternity length of stay law
is having little effect on hospital stays because of a
loophole, state providers say.

In the legislation, insurers are given the option of
allowing an extra day in the hospital beyond the now-
standard 24 hours or paying for a home visit by a nurse.
The much-cheaper home visits are winning by a landslide.

"If it's $1,000 for an extra day in the hospital and $100 to
send a nurse, in every instance the insurer has a choice of
spending $100 or $1,000, and they're going to choose the
lesser amount," says Mark Seigel, an obstetrician who is
president of the Montgomery County Medical Society in
suburban Washington.

"If I don't send a patient home after one day, the patient's
going to get a bill for that extra day," Seigel says.

Maryland was the first state to approve maternity stay
legislation, and was followed closely by New Jersey and
North Carolina.  The Maryland law took effect Oct. 1.

The legislation requires insurers to cover maternity stays
in accordance with the medical criteria outlined in
"Guidelines for Perinatal Care," published jointly by the
American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The guidelines recommend a 48-hour hospital stay following
normal vaginal delivery, but allow for shorter stays if
criteria for medical stability are met.  In cases where the
mother and her physician agree to discharge prior to 48
hours, the Maryland law requires an initial home visit that
includes metabolic screening for the infant.

The Maryland Hospital Association says it does not yet have
statewide information on the length of hospital stays for
childbirth during October, when the law took effect.

But Seigel and other physicians say that insurers are not
giving them the option of choosing the extra day in the
hospital over the home visit.

Insurers have not lengthened hospital stays -- despite the
new law -- because they need to save money somewhere,
according to Robert Sheff, president of HMOs for Blue Cross
Blue Shield of Maryland.  If insurers allow new mothers to
stay in the hospital longer, they will have to take benefits
from someone else, he says.

Maryland physician organizations will press for amending the
law during the next session to close the loophole, Seigel
says, adding, "The details can be worked out.  It's just a
question of coming up with the right language."

Contact Seigel at (301)921-4300 and Sheff at (410)581-3000.

EXPECT MORE COMPETITION, CAPITATION, CONSOLIDATION IN 1996,
EXPERT SAYS

The healthcare market will begin changing dramatically in
1996 as payers demand and get lower prices, predicts Russell
C. Coile, Jr., president of the Health Forecasting Group,
Santa Clarita, Calif.

Competition, capitation and consolidation are in the
forefront of the forces that will drive health trends in the
post-reconciliation era beginning in 1996.  It's all part of
the re-engineering of the American healthcare market,
propelled by payers -- employers, business coalitions, and
government -- who are demanding and getting lower prices and
reduced expenditures from the healthcare sector.

The year ahead will be a war over the premium.  Price wars
between HMOs and insurers are expanding on a national basis.
The decline in HMO/insurance premiums is triggering a wave
of health industry consolidations and deeply slashed
provider payments.  Angered by the cuts, physicians and
hospitals are organizing their own provider-sponsored
networks and fighting back.  The year ahead will be a battle
between providers and payers to control more of the
shrinking premium.

Purchasers will win, providers will lose

Purchasers and government health programs are "winners,"
delighted that national health inflation is coming down.
Corporate health benefit costs rose only 2% from 1994 to
1995, due to widespread switching by employers to managed
care.  Employer-sponsored health costs were one-third below
the level of consumer inflation, according to the
Philadelphia-based Hay Group.

Health plans and providers will be "losers," as price
competition starts a downward spiral for HMO profits and
provider payments.  For the first time in a decade, medical
care prices slipped down to the level of overall consumer
inflation, rising only 0.3% in October 1995, the Wall Street
Journal says.

Managed care and employer-driven price competition are
slashing health costs.  As recently as 1988, the nation's
healthcare prices were soaring at an annual rate of 14%.
Government payment cuts and private-sector competition are
looming for 1996.  Impacts of those trends will ripple
across America's $1 trillion health system, affecting every
hospital, physician, health plan and consumer.

Premium warfare coming

Economic competition between providers and payers --
HMOs/insurers -- over control of the premium could turn ugly
in 1996.  All buyers -- employers, business coalitions and
government programs -- are driving cost competition among
HMOs and insurers.  In 1995, HMO prices fell by 1.2%.  The
down cycle is not over.  Early signals for HMO prices
indicate that health plan premiums will range from no
increases to 2% to 3% rollbacks from 1995 price levels.

In Northern California, which is an emerging "Stage Five"
market including many metropolitan areas with more than 40%
HMO enrollment, the average health plan premium has shrunk
50% in a 10-year period, from $2,460 per enrollee for a
managed care plan in 1986 to $1,260 for HMO coverage in
1995, according to Steve McDermott, CEO of PriMed Inc. and
executive director of the Hill Medical Group, in San Ramon,
Calif.  PriMed manages more than 250,000 capitated lives
through a network of 2,160 physicians.  In 1986, hospitals
got 41% of the premium, and physician services accounted for
33%.  Doctors increased their share of premium to 37% in
1995, while the hospital component shrank to 30%.  The big
winner was the payer, whose administrative costs and profits
grew from 14% in 1986 to 21% today, according to McDermott.

A new "health czar" in town?

Move over Hillary.  Newt Gingrich is the next "health reform
czar" for the 1990s. The Republican-driven federal budget
reconciliation act of 1996 would end the Great Society
commitment to healthcare for the poor and elderly, according
to the Wall Street Journal.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
(R-Ga.) deficit-reduction proposal is the most sweeping
health reform legislation since 1983, when Congress
converted Medicare to a pre-paid health plan.  Wrenching
cuts in Medicare and Medicaid spending may total some $440
billion in the next seven years.  Doctors could see their
federal payments reduced by almost $30 billion, while
hospitals could lose $120 billion or more.

That strategy leans more toward Margaret Thatcher than
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Medicare and Medicaid would be
privatized, with incentives for conversion to HMOs.  The
result would be a multi-tiered health system in which
beneficiaries choose health plans with different coverages,
depending on their ability to pay extra for wider provider
choice or scope of benefits.

Extended wrangling between the White House and GOP
Congressional majority could delay -- but probably not stop
-- GOP-led health reform initiatives.  If Republicans cannot
overcome Clinton vetoes, the GOP may take an "unbundled"
approach to health reform, inserting pieces of their health
reform strategy into other legislation.  Key objectives for
Republican health reformers include:

*  Placing spending limits on entitlement programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid.

*  Reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending and holding down
federal expenditures to 4% to 7% annual increases for the

next five to seven years.

*  Conversion of Medicaid to a block-grant program managed
by the states.

*  Conversion of Medicare to a managed care program that
puts HMOs and provider-sponsored networks -- not government
-- at risk for managing health costs.

*  Caps on Medicare hospital and physician payments.

*  Provider-sponsored networks to allow physicians and
hospitals to enroll Medicare beneficiaries without an HMO
license.

*  Small-business insurance reforms to eliminate waiting
periods, prior existing conditions and experience ratings

*  Malpractice reform that limits "pain-and-suffering" non-
medical damages to $250,000 per case.

*  Medical IRAs and medical savings accounts.

*  Reducing subsidies for teaching hospitals and
"disproportionate share" facilities.

*  Protecting rural hospitals.

Provider-sponsored networks are "silver lining"

The "silver lining" in the massive budget reconciliation
bill is congressional support for provider-sponsored
networks.  Here is a compelling rationale for the 3,000
physician-hospital organizations and integrated networks.
PSNs would give physicians and hospitals a new managed care
vehicle to compete for control of the premium.  The PSN
concept may help level the playing field between providers
and payers.

There could be thousands of PSNs competing for certification
by the Health Care Financing Administration to enroll
directly 37 million Medicare beneficiaries.  New competitors
would  potentially include an estimated 3,000 physician-
hospital organizations, hundreds of large physician groups
and dozens of regional integrated delivery systems.

Becoming a PSN could be risky business. PSNs may need more
experienced partners, such as HMOs and insurers, to control
costs and manage the network.  Managing risk will be the
make-or-break challenge of provider-sponsored networks and,
outside of California, most providers have little or no
experience in capitation.  Providers may turn to HMOs and
insurers for cost management, quality control and
information systems, under a variety of PSN-HMO
arrangements, including those in which providers:

*  "Rent" the HMO/insurer to manage the network, a technique
called administrative services only, in which managed care
plans often contract with self-funded employer health plans.

*  Utilize an independent third-party administrator to link
the provider network contractually, manage contracting and
control utilization and quality.

*   Form strategic business relationships with the
HMO/insurer for management services on a profit-sharing
basis

(but no equity-sharing).

*  Joint venture with shared HMO/insurer equity in the PSN,
where providers develop the healthcare delivery network and
the HMO/insurer supplies the fiscal and management services.

Phase Four:  "War of the networks"

On a national basis, a number of metropolitan areas are
moving into "Stage Four," with more than 25% HMO
penetration, according to InterStudy.  And not just in
California -- the trend is national.  Markets like
Baltimore, Boston, Denver, Honolulu, Louisville, Nashville,
Philadelphia, and Salt Lake City are headed into a "Bermuda
Triangle" of competition, caught in price wars between Blue
Cross Blue Shield-sponsored managed care plans, national
commercial carriers including Aetna and Prudential, and
independent HMOs such as U.S. Healthcare and United
HealthCare, according to InterStudy.

Network-level warfare is heating up, and the stakes are huge
-- control of hundreds of thousands of covered lives and
strategic relationships with leading HMOs, insurers and
employers.  The new playing field is regional or statewide,
and the players are multi-hospital networks with thousands
of physicians.  In recent months, announcements of network
affiliations and acquisitions are arriving non-stop:

*  In Northern California, Sacramento-based Sutter Health
System is creating a new $2.1 billion network with 700,000
covered lives by merging its 17 hospitals, seven medical
groups, ambulatory care sites and HMOs with California
Health System, which operates four hospitals in the Bay
Area.

*  In New Orleans, Santa Monica-based Tenet Healthcare

 Corp. has established an eight-hospital regional IDN that
will include more than 2,400 affiliated physicians, three
speciality facilities and outpatient centers in a three-
parish market.  Tenet will compete head-to-head with
Columbia/HCA, which is negotiating to acquire Woman's
Hospital in Baton Rouge.

Hospital budget strains comes with Medicare cuts

Falling HMO payments and Medicare budget cuts will put
America's hospitals and physicians on a tight budget.
Providers must continue aggressive cost reductions if they
are to maintain a positive bottom line.  Hospitals are
barely coping with lower Medicare payments, managed care
discounts and utilization declines. There is some good news
-- hospital closings fell in 1994.  Only 40 acute care
hospitals closed their doors, down from 62 in 1993,
according to the American Hospital Association.  That was
the fewest number of closed facilities since 1983.

Futurist Jeff Goldsmith, president of Health Futures,
Bannockburn, Ill., describes hospitals as "out of position"
to manage the shifting of managed care risk.  They are
vulnerable to payers who control enrollees "upstream" on the
dollar flow, according to Goldsmith.  The challenge for
hospital profitability is

to keep operating margins in "plus territory" despite
managed care pressures and declining government payments.

According to a recent study by the Center for Healthcare
Industry Performance Studies, hospitals' total profit
margins in 1994 averaged 3.9%, the same as in 1993.  Good
news from hospitals in high-penetration HMO markets --
margins improved to 3.7%, from 2.8% in 1993.  CHIPS co-
founder William O. Cleverly gives credit to cost cutting,
reduced labor costs and better strategic positioning to
those hospitals in heavy managed care markets.  But they
will have to keep it up.  The lessons from the West Coast
are very clear -- the more HMO penetration, the lower the
hospital use rate.  For providers, the winds of change in
1996 will be blowing from the West.

HOSPITAL'S ELECTRONIC NURSING STATION GIVES DOCS OFF-SITE
VIEW OF PATIENTS

The Medical-Oriented Operating Network, an electronic
patient monitoring system, is letting Helen Ellis Memorial
Hospital, Tarpon Springs, Fla., keep a watchful eye on
outpatients and the hospital's performance.

MOON, developed by Unitron Medical Communications,
Clearwater, Fla., allows caregivers to collect patient data
and send them directly to an electronic nursing station
located in the hospital, where physicians have instant
access to information about their patients' status.
Patients can also access the system to update information
such as blood sugar levels or temperature, says Carol
Auhlman, R.N., Unitron's director of network clinical
operations.

MOON functions as a medical on-line system that links all
patient information beyond the hospital.  Patient files in
the system include clinical information, and cost and
quality data are recorded in the database.  Records can only
be accessed by qualified caregivers involved in a patient's
treatment.

The nursing station, called an "E-station," is located
directly inside the physicians' entrance at the hospital, so
doctors can "look in" on their patients' progress as soon as
they arrive.  The can also access the database from their
offices or homes.

The network sends out an immediate alarm if it detects a
critical variance in the patient's condition, and "quicker
intervention means less deterioration," says Linda Chic,
R.N. who works in the E-station.

Unitron also has access to the database, and uses the data
for a variety of studies to inform administrators at Helen
Ellis about the hospital's performance.
