 <i>Watch your high blood pressure drop to normal when you change your diet, take coenzyme Q10, exercise, and release buried emotions, says cardiologist Stephen Sinatra, M.D.</i><p>
</center>

When it comes to heart disease, prevention is easier than cure, says cardiologist Stephen T. Sinatra, M.D., executive director of the New England Heart Center in Man-chester, Connecticut. Based on 20 years of experience as a board-certified cardiologist, Dr. Sinatra strongly believes that "if you do have heart disease, you can slow its progression and even reverse it." One of the best places to start is to reduce high blood pressure, a major risk factor for cardiovascular illness, says Dr. Sinatra. It may be major, but it's also controllable, using natural nondrug approaches, he adds.<p>
To accomplish this, Dr. Sinatra offers a comprehensive alternative program of dietary change, nutritional supplements, exercise, and psychological counseling, in addition to some conventional prescription of beta blockers and other "antihypertensive" drugs. Dr. Sinatra's approach addresses the mind and body, the physiology and emotions, of the individual with high blood pressure.<p>
"There is definitely a heart/brain 'hotline,'" he notes in his new book Heartbreak & Heart Disease. "The identification of people at risk for sudden death depends not only on the hidden possibilities of heart disease, but also on the psychological and emotional status of the one afflicted." To appreciate his approach, we must first understand certain heart basics.<p>
<b>THE HEART UNDER PRESSURE</b><p>
In the U.S., high blood pressure, or hypertension, accounts for an estimated 28.3 million annual office visits to conventional physicians, or about 7.2% of all doctors' appointments in a year. This amount is twice that for acute upper respiratory infection, the next most prevalent health condition on a list of the top 10, according to data compiled by Scott-Levin's Physician Drug and Diagnosis Audit in 1996. <p>
High blood pressure, in fact, is regarded as the most common of all cardiovascular diseases in industrialized nations and is a major cause of heart attack, stroke, and congestive heart failure. In the U.S., an estimated 50 million adults suffer from hypertension, including more than 50% of those over age 60, and 64% of those over 70.<p>
To understand high blood pressure, you need to know a few facts about the heart. The human heart beats on average 70 times per minute, 100,000 times a day, and 2.5 billion times in a lifetime. With each heart beat, about 2.5 ounces of blood are pumped through the heart-that is 1,980 gallons every day. <p>
The term blood pressure refers to the force of the blood against the walls of arteries, veins, and the chambers of the heart as it is pumped through the body. The additional force exerted by the blood against the arteries (when high blood pressure is present) begins to weaken the cellular walls and makes it easier for harmful substances, such as toxins and cholesterol, to form dangerous deposits on the arterial walls.<p>
Blood pressure measurement involves 2 key numbers: systolic (when the heart contracts) and diastolic (when the heart rests and fills with more blood). The ratio of the 2 represents blood pressure, as in 120/85, an "average" or healthy reading. A typical reading indicative of early high blood pressure is 140/90.<p>
<b>COENZYME Q10: <br>
AN ENERGY NUTRIENT FOR THE HEART</b><p>
Pamela, aged 47, came to Dr. Sinatra with a seriously high blood pressure of 205/105. About 2 years earlier, physicians had placed her on standard antihypertensive drugs, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors. These had left her excessively fatigued, coughing, and dissatisfied with the results. <p>
Dr. Sinatra immediately started Pamela on coenzyme Q10, at a dosage of 30 mg, 3 times daily; at the same time he reduced her intake of high blood pressure drugs by half. CoQ10, a substance found naturally in sardines, salmon, mackerel, and beef heart (but not made by the human body) is an essential feature of Dr. Sinatra's program because it helps prevent the depletion of substances that recharge the cellular energy system in the body. 	<p>
"As the heart muscle continually uses oxygen and consumes huge amounts of energy, heart muscle cells can greatly benefit from the energy boost of coenzyme Q10," says Dr. Sinatra. In fact, levels of coQ10 are usually 10 times higher in the healthy heart than in any other organ. This is why a coQ10 deficiency is most likely to primarily affect the heart and contribute to heart failure. It is estimated that 39% of patients with high blood pressure have a coQ10 deficiency. <p>
The heart requires a constant supply of coQ10 to meet its energy needs. It is both "extremely vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies" and highly receptive to the benefits of "targeted nutrition," Dr. Sinatra says. Clinical research indicates it usually takes 4-12 weeks for coQ10 to have a noticeable effect on blood pressure.<p>
"I regard coQ10 as one of the best medical discoveries of the 20th century," he states. "I've been using it for 10 years and have probably thousands of patients on it now. It is absolutely essential for strengthening the biochemistry of the heart cells." CoQ10 functions like a vitamin, "rescuing" body tissues that have been damaged by free radicals. "CoQ10 taken for cardiovascular conditions may enable some patients to reduce the dosage of their medications by up to 50%," notes Dr. Sinatra.<p>
For these reasons, Dr. Sinatra starts almost all his cardiovascular patients on coQ10 at the initial low dose of 90 mg daily, then gradually increases it. "Extemely few people are oversensitive to it and may experience nausea-very rarely do I see side effects," says Dr. Sinatra. After 1 week, he increased Pamela's coQ10 dosage to 60 mg, 3 times daily.<p>
The standard dose for coQ10, as commonly prescribed by physicians, is "sub-therapeutic" and probably too low to be effective, says Dr. Sinatra. If you take 90-120 mg daily, you're likely to have a blood level of 1.5 ug/ml of usable coQ10, while what the body requires for a strong therapeutic response is 2.5 to 3.5 ug/ml. <p>
As a general heart-protective dose, Dr. Sinatra himself takes 180 mg daily, but for high blood pressure, he usually builds toward a daily dose of 180-360 mg, and for serious congestive heart failure, 360-400 mg daily. For preventive maintenance for someone without a specific heart problem, Dr. Sinatra recommends a dosage of 30-90 mg daily.<p>
<b>THE VALUE OF A MEDITERRANEAN DIET</b><p>
Dr. Sinatra also recommended that Pamela institute major changes in her diet. Specifically, he said her diet should consist of 30% fats, 20-25% protein, and 45-50% carbohydrates. The fats should come from fish such as salmon, mackerel, Greenland halibut, cod, and blue fish, but not tuna because of possible mercury contamination. Large amounts of red meat should be avoided while fresh fruits and vegetables are emphasized. Dr. Sinatra calls this the traditional Mediterranean diet. <p>
A now classic study conducted in the 1980s investigating the rate of heart attacks over a 10-year period for individuals in European nations revealed that the island of Crete reported zero heart attacks as a cause of death, even though many of the residents had dangerously high cholesterol levels, a presumed risk factor for heart disease. <p>
According to Dr. Sinatra, "the Mediterranean diet, rich in monounsaturated fat (olive oil) and antioxidants, has proved to be crucial in cardiovascular protection." Dr. Sinatra says this diet is low in saturated fats (such as dairy products and meats), high in fiber and antioxidants (from fresh fruits and vegetables) such as vitamin C, beta carotene, and vitamin E, and high in essential fatty acids, found in flax and other omega-3 oils. <p>
Avocadoes and asparagus, commonly eaten in this diet, are rich in L-glutathione, an amino acid that can scavenge harmful free radicals, while garlic and onions have ingredients that help protect the heart, and olive oil is "the healthiest of oils, no doubt."<p>
Underlying the success of the Mediterranean diet is a biochemical principle, Dr. Sinatra says. It is called insulin resistance or hyperinsulinism. Insulin is a key digestive hormone, secreted by the pancreas for regulating the absorption of glucose (blood sugar) and the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. In general, most Americans are eating too many carbohydrates which in turn leads to excess insulin secretion (hyperinsulinism) and to insulin resistance, says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
"When you've had too much insulin circulating in your bloodstream for too long-as is often the case when people doggedly stick to high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets-specialized receptor cells lose their ability to respond to insulin." The resulting insulin resistance can lead to higher blood pressure, thickened, less elastic arterial walls, increased cravings for carbohydrates, and higher blood sugar levels, says Dr. Sinatra.  <p>
This factor contributes to heart disease in 2 ways. First, as insulin secretion increases, so does the level of arachidonic acid; further biochemical changes resulting from this cause blood vessels to constrict and blood to clot, and this sets up a risk factor for both higher blood pressure and serious heart problems. <p>
The second problem with too much insulin is that it is antagonistic to the cells (called endothelial) that line the blood vessels and keep them free of obstructions, Dr. Sinatra says. As insulin levels rise, the structural integrity of the endothelial cells suffers and the type of muscles in the blood vessels changes. The result can be blood vessels that are prone to developing plaque deposits, which again can lead to high blood pressure, he adds.<p>
"The benefit of the Mediterranean diet is that everything in it helps prevent excess insulin release," says Dr. Sinatra. The diet, through saltwater fish, shellfish, and flaxseed, contains high levels of alpha-linolenic and omega-3 fatty acids, which are "the most important essential fatty acids for the protection of cardiovascular health." <p>
Dr. Sinatra also generally recommends minimizing the consumption of "high glycemic carbohydrates." This means foods such as flour pastas, white potatoes, and white rice, whose carbohydrate portion enters the bloodstream quickly, leading to higher levels of  insulin to handle the sudden glucose load. Examples of fruits with a low-glycemic index (slow absorption by the blood) include grapefruit, cherries, peaches, plums, kiwi, and rhubarb. Pamela was also instructed to avoid preservatives, processed foods and meats, canned vegetables, diet soft drinks, and chemical ingredients.<p>
Under Dr. Sinatra's supervision, Pamela added tofu, navy beans, and seaweeds to her diet for their magnesium content. She also started taking an antioxidant vitamin-mineral formula (containing no copper or iron) developed by Dr. Sinatra under the brand name Optimum Health. <p>
Pamela started taking a daily formula containing 1000 mg calcium and 500 mg magnesium. These amounts were in addition to the vitamin-mineral supplement which contained lower amounts of both (280 mg of magnesium, 250 mg of calcium). "Magnesium prevents spasming of blood vessels which is why it's one of the most important mineral treatments for high blood pressure," says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
Dr. Sinatra also encouraged Pamela to begin a regular exercise program, preferably vigorous walking. "I don't recommend jogging. If you can do a brisk walk lasting 15 minutes twice a day, that's all the exercise you really need," says Dr. Sinatra. As an alternative, he advises dancing (and practices it himself) as a "heart nurturing" form of daily rhythmic exercise. Regularity, not intensity, of exercise is paramount, he says.<p>
At Pamela's next appointment 2 weeks later, her blood pressure had dropped to 170/90, "a big improvement," says Dr. Sinatra. He kept her on the diet and supplement program, including coQ10 at 180 mg daily; he took her off calcium channel blocker but kept her on a low dose of beta blocker. She maintained a daily walking program of 1-2 miles. After about 3 months on the Sinatra program, Pamela's blood pressure had come down to a safe 140-145/80-85. "I was satisfied with that," Dr. Sinatra says.<p>
<b>HAWTHORN HELPS COLIN'S HEART RELAX</b><p>
Dr. Sinatra offers another case involving Colin, aged 65, who came to him with a history of heart attacks and progressive heart failure. His problem was that his heart's pumping ability was severely reduced. Colin's blood pressure was 180/90, he was unable to tolerate most conventional heart drugs, and his mitral valve (one of the heart's 4 valves) was leaking blood as a result of his high blood pressure. Colin had chronic shortness of breath and was unable to walk much without getting winded.<p>
Dr. Sinatra started Colin on the Mediterranean diet, coQ10, magnesium, calcium, and potassium supplements, and hawthorn herbal extract (from hawthorn berries) beginning at 500 mg daily, then increasing to 1000 mg. Clinical studies have shown that hawthorn can help reduce blood pressure by reducing or blocking the constriction of blood vessels directly serving the heart. This is crucial because when blood vessels constrict, blood pressure rises. "I gave Colin hawthorn to reduce his blood pressure, strengthen his heart, and give him a good quality of life," which means improved health without the unpleasant side effects of drugs.<p>
Colin also began taking B vitamins, specifically 40 mg each of B1, B2, and B6, 40 mcg of B12, and 800 mcg of folic acid. "I recommend B vitamins for anybody with heart disease because they are the antidote to a condition we call hyperhomocysteinemia," says Dr. Sinatra. <p>
Here is how it works: Red meat contains methionine, an essential amino acid and protein building block. But if your system is deficient in B vitamins, methionine does not get broken down into simpler substances and instead forms homocysteine. Too much homocysteine contributes to premature heart disease and aging, explains Dr. Sinatra. <p>
After about 6 weeks on the program, Colin's blood pressure dropped to 140-145/90-95. There was less leakage at his mitral valve; he was not taking any conventional drugs; he was able to walk, play golf, and exercise more freely; and "he felt he was in terrific control of his life," says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
Often an individual with high blood pressure or heart disease suffers from depression and sexual dysfunction including impotence, Dr. Sinatra notes. Sometimes these conditions are caused by conventional drugs; other times, they result from diminished nutrition and unresolved emotional issues. To help shift the depression that can accompany heart problems, Dr. Sinatra prescribes the amino acid L-tyrosine. Getting a person off conventional heart drugs and onto a solid nutritional support program often completes the turnaround, he adds.<p>
"When you empower patients with nutritional support, diet, and exercise, they have control over their destiny and develop a much greater optimism. When you have this optimism about participating in your health, you become alive sexually. I've seen this many times. I tell them I am not their doctor but their nurse. In other words, I will nurse them along and nurture their healing, but they have the power to get well."<p>
<b>UNCOVERING THE ANGER IN RAY'S BLOOD PRESSURE</b><p>
It's important not to overlook the crucial role that emotions can play in the development of high blood pressure, notes Dr. Sinatra. "The psychological risk factors can be just as lethal as the more accepted physical risk factors," he says. Unresolved emotions, such as anger, hostility, and rage, and the way one reacts to stress are hidden risk factors in heart disease that many cardiologists fail to acknowledge. <p>
To many, both physicians and patients, these emotions represent the "dark side" or shadow portion of the personality that tends to get denied or suppressed. "But I think that getting in touch with these powerful hidden emotions and becoming aware of their contribution to heart disease is critical to healing and protecting the heart," Dr. Sinatra says. Ray's case perfectly demonstrates this point.<p>
Ray, aged 44, was a corporate  executive in a position of high responsibility and stress. His blood pressure was "horrendous" at 220/115 and was not responding at all to conventional antihypertensive drugs when he first came for treatment. Dr. Sinatra performed an emotional stress test on Ray, using a computerized device called a Cardiac Performance Laboratory (CPL) that in effect measures anger by evaluating the degree to which the blood vessels are constricted from hypertension. The CPL measures 17 dynamic circulatory changes inside the heart and blood vessels.<p>
Dr. Sinatra asked Ray to perform mental arithmetic, put his hands in ice cold water, and answer stressful questions. The test registers the changes in blood pressure literally with each heartbeat in accordance with these requests. If you are a reasonably calm person, putting your hands in ice water will elevate your blood pressure 5-10 points, says Dr. Sinatra, but if you are what is called a "hot reactor" or physiological over-reactor, the jump may be 30-40 points. <p>
"With Ray, I was dealing with a man who was very calm on the outside but on the inside, he was a hot reactor. When I asked him questions about his mother or his personal life, he virtually went off the walls with his blood pressure." He saw it rise dangerously to 240/125 under stress. "Ray was a young man but in tough shape-a risk for sudden death." <p>
During his interview with Ray, Dr. Sinatra observed how much anger Ray held in his body, as evidenced by his clenched jaw and shallow breathing. Dr. Sinatra then understood why the antihypertensive drugs were having no useful effect on Ray: his anger was the prime cause of his high blood pressure. <p>
"Are you aware of how much anger you have?" Dr. Sinatra asked him. Ray responded: "Yes, but I can't get it out or show it." He then admitted he had never shared this secret with anybody nor had he ever allowed himself to show his anger. "Then Ray started to cry because he was seeing this side of himself for the first time. Crying is very healthy for the heart. I try to reframe a patient's anger and make it a healing rather than a destructive energy."<p>
After this meeting, Ray started psychotherapy with a practitioner trained in the way emotions can be lodged in the body. Soon after, Ray's corporation transferred him to another city, but when Dr. Sinatra heard from him about 6 months later, Ray reported that his blood pressure was completely normal.<p>
Ray's case underscores another important insight gained from the heart study of the Cretans, particularly the men, says Dr. Sinatra. Equally as important as their Mediterranean diet is the fact that men in that region tend to talk more openly with other men about their feelings, families, dreams, and spiritual beliefs. <p>
Men in this Mediterranean culture tend not to wear social masks, but feel comfortable arguing, crying, supporting, even holding one another, says Dr. Sinatra. This quality of  comradery and the respect for the "healing powers of nurturing relationships" is a major factor accounting for the low level of coronary heart disease among that population, he says.<p>
Best of all-for his patients-Dr. Sinatra tries to be a good example of what is required to keep one's heart healthy and unpressured. He works hard but he listens to his body so he does not become highly stressed. He takes coQ10, practices the Mediterranean diet, and loves to dance. "I cry when I want to and have my anger-I experience my dark-side, shadow emotions." <p>
He never forgets that becoming ill, whether with high blood pressure or other heart ailments, "is really a form of disease that emerges from the chaotic imbalance of mind, body, and spirit." For a cardiovascular therapy to be completely successful, says Dr. Sinatra, it must heal this "disturbed relationship," addressing heart stress at the metabolic, physiological, psychological, and even spiritual levels.
