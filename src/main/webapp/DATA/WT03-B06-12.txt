REGION: SUMMIT ON REGIONAL SECURITY
SKIRTS DEMILITARIZATION ISSUE

     The Central American presidential summit held in San
Pedro Sula, Honduras, Dec. 13-15, 1995, ended with serious
disagreement among the six nations represented.  Costa Rica
and Panama blocked or modified almost all proposals having to
do with the military in the Treaty on Central American
Democratic Security--the major agreement to come out of the
summit.
     The signatories agreed on the principle of military
subordination to civilian control, free elections, and respect
for human rights by the military, among other things.  But
demilitarization of the region received scant attention.
     Since 1986, Central American presidents have attended 16
regional summits on such issues as economic integration,
sustainable development, tourism, social spending, and
campaigns against crime, illiteracy, and drug trafficking.
     The San Pedro Sula meeting was perhaps the most
contentious, in part because there is a wider range of
national policies on military matters than on social and
economic problems.  The military aspects of the treaty were
perhaps doomed to failure because neither Costa Rica nor
Panama have military forces, while Guatemala, with the largest
army in Central America, is still involved in a civil war.
     The theme of the summit was regional security, which
included a regional approach to such problems as public safety
and collective security from aggressors.  However, objections
from Costa Rica and Panama forced the elimination of some
provisions and considerable revision of others.
     Both the Panamanian and Costa Rican delegates arrived at
San Pedro Sula to press for armed forces reduction, but
resistance from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and
Nicaragua to anything more than a nonbinding commitment to
future reductions irrevocably split the delegations into two
camps.  Costa Rica and Panama objected to 11 of the treaties
78 articles and signed the treaty with reservations.
     Panama's objections were similar to those of Costa Rica
but with an additional concern that the treaty could
compromise its efforts to sign an agreement with the US
permitting US troops to remain in that country after the
Panama Canal reverts to Panamanian control in the year 2000
(see NotiSur, 12/08/95).  The draft treaty contained a
prohibition against signatory countries permitting foreign
troops on their soil, but this was struck from the final
version.
     Instead of force reductions and the gradual elimination
of armed forces, the treaty as signed only calls for a
"reasonable balance" among the military forces of the region
and a promise to work toward arms limitations and a "proper
correlation" between force size and national budgets.
     Costa Rican sources said that Foreign Minister Fernando
Naranjo objected to an article that calls for the creation of
a mutual defense mechanism to combat aggression within the
region.  The concern, said the sources, was that in making
claims to sovereignty over Belize, Guatemala could define that
country as a possible aggressor.
     "Costa Rica wants to be sure that the [treaty] content is
not...conditioned upon special issues that affect only some
countries," said Costa Rica's roving ambassador to Central
America, Luis Solis.
     Other objections were to articles that urged each nation
to take its constitution into account when setting budget
levels for the military, and to issue a report on the size,
budget, and expenditures of its armed forces.  Observers at
the summit explained that Panama and Costa Rica raised general
objections to these and other military articles because they
did not go far enough in requiring all nations in the region
to reduce the role of the military in national affairs.
     What Costa Rica wanted instead, said Solis, was a treaty
that emphasized nonmilitary aspects of Central American
security--such as public safety--rather than national defense.
Armed forces, he said, should be made smaller and police
forces given more training and a higher priority than the
military.
     Commenting on the lack of interest in demilitarization on
the part of his Central American colleagues, Naranjo said,
"They would not accept [our proposal] and we were not able to
endorse anything that had to do with military matters, unless
they dealt with reductions."
     Both sides on the force-reduction issue attempted to end
the summit on a note of harmony.  Costa Rican President Jose
Maria Figueres promised to continue pushing for force
reductions, "but we will do it in a respectful manner without
trying to impose our opinions and models on anyone," he said.
     For his part, Honduran Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo
said that the contentious military aspects of the treaty could
be signed on another occasion without harming the San Pedro
Sula summit, which he said focused on the broader definition
of security as a response to social problems.
     "If the theme of military security is an obstacle to
having a successful summit, we will simply cut it from the
agenda and sign it later," he said.
     However, the differences in policy views highlighted at
the summit suggest that the signing of a comprehensive
military accord may be a long way off.  Though Costa Rica's
chief proposal was for the gradual reduction in the size of
armies, a more fundamental aspect of the clash of policies
lies in the differing concepts of the military's role in the
post-Cold War era.
     Col. Francisco Bustillo of the Honduran armed forces
general staff pointed out the changed historical
circumstances.
     "The role played by our countries was the one assigned by
foreign interests, based on a political-military thesis," said
Bustillo.  Now, "geoeconomics has been substituted for
geopolitics, and the political map is no longer drawn along
ideological lines."  Bustillo added that the present dangers
are not military but social and economic.
     Bustillo was expressing the conceptual foundation for the
argument that the military must be called upon to respond to
threats in the social and economic spheres.  By extending the
definition of national and regional security beyond
traditional notions of national defense to include social
well-being, military forces will continue to merit high
priority in national budgetary considerations.
     Echoing Bustillo, Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Ernesto
Leal argued that in this model for security, armies may be
deployed to fight against drugs, to support environmental
protection efforts, to construct schools and clinics, and to
respond to natural disasters.
     "The most important thing," said Leal, "is that the
treaty confirms the subordination of military power to
civilian power."
     Nevertheless, Costa Rican delegates were skeptical that
this confirmation will guarantee effective control of the
military precisely because the treaty "leaves the door open
for the armies to assume new roles."
     The delegates had less difficulty agreeing to an accord
providing for common action against auto theft and mechanisms
for the return of stolen autos recovered outside their country
of origin.  They also announced that they had signed an
agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for
assistance in building a regional electric-power grid.
     But these accomplishments were not enough to head off
severe criticism of the summit.  The auxiliary bishop of San
Salvador, Gregorio Rosa Chavez, said, "The summit gave short
shrift to issues vital for true democratic security in Central
America," and he faulted the presidents for a "lack of
audacity."
     Other critics of the summit pointed to the demonstrations
that took place on Dec. 13 during the inauguration of the
summit as an example of heads of state turning a deaf ear to
social issues.  Seven demonstrators were shot, one fatally, by
unknown assailants.  The demonstration was organized to demand
an investigation into the shooting deaths by the police of
three campesinos taking part in a previous demonstration.
     The advisory committee on Central American integration
(Comite Consultivo del Sistema de Integracion Centroamericano
(CC-SICA) faulted the summit for not including representative
social participation in the formulation of the treaty.
     The president of the Center for Social Training (Centro
de Capacitacion Social) in Panama, Celia Sanjur, said that
"the lack of participatory democracy and the inability of
governments to satisfy the needs of the population" directly
affect regional security.  [Sources: Associated Press,

HAITI: RENE PREVAL WINS PRESIDENCY, NOW FACES
SERIOUS DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES (Part 1)

     In the Dec. 17 Haitian presidential elections,
Organisation Politique Lavalas (OPL) candidate Rene Preval won
a sweeping victory, taking 89% of the vote, according to
official results from the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
While voting was carried out without incident, turnout was
very low, at just under 28%.
     Although fourteen candidates participated in the election
to succeed President Jean Bertrand Aristide, the outcome was
never in doubt.  From Nov. 15, when Lavalas announced that
Preval would be its candidate, his victory was practically
assured, since an estimated 80% of the population are Lavalas
loyalists.  However, winning the election will likely prove
much easier for the president-elect than resolving Haiti's
social and economic problems.
     An agronomist who completed his higher education in
Belgium, the 52-year-old Preval served as prime minister in
Aristide's first cabinet from February 1991 to September 1991,
when Aristide was toppled ie been extended to make up for
the three years that he was forced to spend in exile.  Even
many among the Haitian elite and business community said the
nation's stability would have been better served by Aristide's
continuation in office.
     A wave of violence in the weeks preceding the elections
had raised questions about whether voting would actually take
place on schedule.  In an emotional speech Nov. 11, following
the execution-style killing of his cousin and newly elected
deputy Jean-Hubert Feuille, Aristide blasted the US and UN for
not disarming the country and urged the public to help do so.
     "If those who have weapons, those who have big armored
tanks, those who have much power, wanted to help us, the
disarmament would have been done," Aristide said.
     The president called on the public to collaborate with
police by leading them to suspected arms caches.  During the
following week, at least seven people were killed in
demonstrations and protests as people responded to Aristide's
call for public action.
     It was the first time since Aristide returned that he
veered from his message of reconciliation.  However, many of
his backers contend that, in practice, reconciliation has
allowed the supporters of the coup to participate in public
life and, in many cases, to remain armed.  Aristide's message
of reconciliation never had the support of the poor who
suffered the repression of the military and who saw
reconciliation as a synonym for impunity and continued
injustice.
     When Preval assumes office, he, like Aristide, will find
himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the
demands of his supporters with those of the Haitian elite and
the international community, particularly the US.
     "It is a great dilemma," said Harry Numa of the National
Popular Assembly.  "When Aristide tries to please the people,
the bourgeoisie and the US pressure him.  When he wants to
placate the bourgeoisie and Washington, the people tell him
no."
     The Clinton administration pushed hard for Aristide to
fulfill his commitment to step down at the end of his term,
since its portrayal of Haiti as a US foreign policy success
was riding on a smooth transfer of power.  (Cont.)

HAITI: RENE PREVAL WINS PRESIDENCY, NOW FACES
SERIOUS DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES (Part 2)

     However, US policy toward Haiti has been ambivalent at
best.  Although the September 1994 US-led invasion allowed
Aristide to return to power, congressional Republicans have
openly opposed the Haitian leader and Preval may face similar
difficulties because of his closeness to his predecessor.
     In November, the US Congress cut off US$4.5 million in
economic aid to Haiti because the government had not moved
forward with economic reforms, including several controversial
privatizations (see NotiSur, 11/10/95).  The World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have not disbursed another
US$45 million for the same reason.  Even if Preval starts
negotiations immediately after his inauguration, funds will
still not flow again before summer.
     Sen. Jesse Helms, powerful head of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, freed up previously blocked funds for the
Haitian election only because it paved the way for the
turnover to a new leader and the withdrawal of US troops,
which make up a large part of the UN peacekeeping force.
     However, according to an article in the Washington Post
in mid-November, the US is considering staying in Haiti beyond
its scheduled departure date, citing the "inexperience" of the
newly formed civilian police.  On Nov. 30, Adrain Rameau, head
of the Haitian National Police, was fired following several
shootings that critics claim demonstrate the country's new
officers pull their guns too quickly.
     Another issue that will likely carry over after Preval
assumes office centers on the return of more than 150,000
pages of documents that were confiscated from the Front for
the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH), a paramilitary
organization.  US troops seized the documents after the
invasion and then took them to the US.
     Haitian officials said that until now the US refused to
hand over the papers because it feared the information would
embarrass US intelligence agencies.  Washington does not want
to see leaders of paramilitary groups go on trial in Haiti and
"have it emerge that they were paid and supported by American
intelligence," explained one ves arrested by US soldiers.
     The Nation article also contends that weapons were
shipped to FRAPH starting in June 1993 despite the US arms
embargo.  The article says that US diplomats have used the
alleged power of FRAPH to help pressure Aristide's government
on broader political issues.
     Meanwhile, Constant plans to sue the US for US$50 million
for holding him in custody since April 1995.  Constant's
attorneys said he was seeking damages from the government for
"wrongful incarceration."  (Sources: New York Times, 11/28/95;

GUATEMALA: GAP BETWEEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
CLOSES SUBSTANTIALLY AS RUNOFF ELECTION NEARS

     The latest opinion polls indicate that Guatemala's two
runoff presidential candidates will fight a close battle to
win the second round of elections, scheduled for Jan. 7.  Most
local officials and politicians, however, predict that
abstention in the second round will climb to about 70% of the
registered electorate.
     In late November, Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal
(Tribunal Supremo Electoral, TSE) released the final results
for the Nov. 12 general elections (see NotiSur, 11/10/95 and
11/17/95).  As indicated in the preliminary results reported
in mid-November, Alvaro Arzu--presidential candidate for the
Partido de Avanzada Nacional (PAN)--took first place with
nearly 37% of the votes (see table).  The Frente Republicano
Guatemalteco (FRG) candidate, Alfonso Portillo, took second
place with 22% of the votes.
     The Alianza Nacional--which grouped the Democracia
Cristiana Guatemalteca (DCG), the Union del Centro Nacional
(UCN), and the Partido Social Democrata (PSD) in a tripartite
coalition--took third place with nearly 13%.  The leftist
Frente Democratico Nacional Guatemalteco (FDNG) took fourth
place with nearly 8% of the votes.
     Of the remaining 17 parties that participated in the
elections, only the Partido Libertador Popular (PLP) won more
than 4% of the votes, which is the minimum a party must obtain
to retain its legal status after the elections.  The
Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN) and the Union
Democratica (UD) managed to retain their legal status because
they each won a seat in the National Congress.  But the
remaining 14 parties will now be officially dissolved,
reducing to nine Guatemala's recognized political parties.
     PAN also swept the congressional elections, taking 43 of
the unicameral legislature's 80 seats.  The FRG will form the
second largest bloc in Congress with 21 seats.
     Despite the Alianza Nacional's third place position in
absolute votes won in the elections, the coalition was
dissolved after the elections and the seven congressional
seats won by the Alianza were then divided between the DCG and
the UCN.  Thus, even though the FDNG took fourth place in
total votes, that party is now the third strongest political
force in the legislature, with six congressional seats.
     Finally, PAN won eight of the 20 seats contested in the
elections for the Central American Parliament (Parlacen).  The
FRG took five seats, and the remaining seven seats will be
fairly evenly divided among the Alianza parties, the FDNG, the
PLP, and the UD.

 into a referendum on the general.
     Indeed, Rios Montt has accompanied Portillo throughout
the campaign.  At most campaign rallies since November,
Portillo has limited his speeches to just a few minutes,
allowing the general to dominate the show.
     Apparently, a wave of common and political violence that
has gripped the country since early December is contributing
to Portillo's rise in the polls, since most voters who support
Rios Montt approve of the general's hard-line approach to
crime.  In fact, speculation reigns in Guatemala that the
sharp rise in violence since early December is a deliberate
tactic by extreme-right groups that hope to sway votes in
favor of the FRG, which promises to crack down on crime and
"restore order" to the country.
     Indeed, Francisco Reyes--an FRG congressional deputy who
helped found the party and is one of the organization's
principal leaders--stated in mid-December that if the FRG wins
the elections, Rios Montt will be given control over national
security.
     "The decision has already been taken," said Reyes.  "Gen.
Rios Montt will be made state secretary for national
security."
      Meanwhile, regardless of the closeness of the
presidential race, most local observers expect abstention will
grow dramatically in the runoff election.  In the first round
of voting, only 46% of the registered 3.7 million voters went
to the polls.  The 53% abstention rate in the November
elections was significantly higher than that registered in the
last two presidential elections.  In the first round in 1985,
only 31% of voters abstained from going to the polls, and in
the first round in the 1990 presidential elections, abstention
only reached 44%.
     In the second round on Jan. 7, spokespersons from the
Civil Registry have predicted that at least 65% of registered
voters will abstain.  Independent estimates place the
abstention rate as high as 75%.  [Sources: Prensa Libre

COLOMBIA: CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT
ERNESTO SAMPER SHELVED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE

     On Dec. 14 the legislative commission examining links
between the Cali drug cartel and the 1994 election campaign of
President Ernesto Samper ruled there was insufficient evidence
to launch a full-scale investigation of the president.
Nevertheless, the scandal continues to cast a shadow on the
Samper administration and its relationship with the US.
     The Accusations Commission announced that it had voted
14-to-1 to shelve a preliminary probe into charges that Samper
personally authorized the receipt of US$6 million in Cali
cartel drug money to win the election in 1994.  Eleven of the
committee's 15 members belong to Samper's Partido Liberal.
     Under Colombian law, the commission had three options:
it could have definitely closed the case, meaning that Samper
could not have been investigated on the same charges again; it
could rule--as it did--that there was insufficient evidence to
charge the president, which allows the investigation to be
reopened in the future; or it could have recommended that the
Senate begin impeachment proceedings against the president.
     Charges that drug money found its way into Samper's
campaign first erupted two days after Samper's election in
June 1994.  The investigation by the Accusations Commission
began last August (see NotiSur, 06/24/95, 04/04/95, and
08/25/95).
     The campaign finance scandal, which led to the arrests of
several of Samper's closest political associates--including
former defense minister Fernando Botero and Santiago Medina,
treasurer of Samper's campaign--has soured ties with
Washington and intensified long-standing suspicions about
Colombia's underlying commitment to the anti-drug fight.  The
commission's decision is unlikely to calm the troubled waters.
     US Ambassador Myles Frechette has warned that the US may
remove Colombia's certification as a partner in the fight
against drugs next year, withdrawing key aid and trade
preferences.  Conditional cer a growing number
of Colombians believed that not only Samper but his
conservative rival Andres Pastrana accepted drug money
campaign contributions.  However, a poll published Nov. 19 by
the daily El Tiempo indicated that while 58.3% of Colombians
believed that the drug cartels contributed to Samper's
campaign, 61% said he should not resign.
     After Samper's television appearance following the
commission's decision, his public approval ratings rose.  A
poll take by El Tiempo immediately after the program aired
indicated that the president had convinced 65% of the audience
of his innocence, while 35% continued to believe him guilty.
     In his public address, Samper insisted he would not
resign, saying it would be an act of "cowardice" to abandon
his office in the midst of a crisis.  (Sources: Reuter,
