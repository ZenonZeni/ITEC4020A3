<PRE>

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Coppolino?

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, all right, Mr. Coppolino, Judge

    14           Dalzell has invited you up.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Didn't you want to -- did you have

    17           anything else for us or --

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think the only thing that's left

    19           to do today before the hearing concludes is for the

    20           Government to formally move into evidence its exhibits.

    21                    I think this is going to be broken down in two

    22           categories because I think plaintiffs have objections to the

    23           exhibits or some of the exhibits.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think that they can be safely
                                                                            99

     1           categorized as two main areas: one is the Howard Schmidt

     2           exhibits of the sexually explicit material.  They may have

     3           objections to some or all of those and I think that that's

     4           one argument, if you will.

     5                    In addition, we have extracted from the various

     6           notebooks we have submitted to the Court over the last two

     7           hearing days other exhibits which we would formally move into

     8           evidence and there would be, I believe, some evidentiary

     9           objections with respect to some of those.

    10                    With respect to that grouping I would ask Ms.

    11           Russotto to present those exhibits and to respond to any

    12           objections that they may have and then deal separately with

    13           any objections to the Howard Schmidt exhibits, or we could

    14           reverse the order, if it please the Court.

    15                    The only other point I would make preliminarily is I

    16           don't know if the Court has those notebooks and if you wanted

    17           to break and get them or whatnot, but that's really all that

    18           has to be done before the hearing can conclude.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do plaintiffs know now which you're

    20           going to offer into evidence so that you have locked horns

    21           already on those?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I believe so.  So we could

    23           start with the non Howard Schmidt exhibits, if you'd like.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I didn't bring any exhibits down at

    25           all.
                                                                           100

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, I've got the books here.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Or we could start -- whichever.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, why don't we just do it

     4           before lunch?  Is that all right with you, Stewart?

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

     6                    (Discussion off the record.)

     7                    MR. BARON:  Excuse me, your Honor, could Dr. Olsen

     8           be excused?

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I think so, unless he wants to

    10           rule on the exhibits.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you very much, Dr. Olsen.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have a good trip back.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We want to ask counsel a question

    15           as to what difference it's going to make for the purposes of

    16           our decisionmaking?  In other words, if the Government has

    17           proffered the exhibits and we were to rule that some were not

    18           relevant or appropriate, they would still have to go into the

    19           record as proffered.  And we're not dealing with a jury, so

    20           why don't we let it -- why would the plaintiffs want to

    21           object to letting anything in for this purpose?

    22                    MS. HEINS:  Thank you, your Honor, Marjorie Heins

    23           for the ACLU plaintiffs.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can you be heard on the -- can she

    25           be heard on the tape?
                                                                           101

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, go ahead.

     3                    MS. HEINS:  A few -- well, to start with, the Court

     4           should have our objections to the exhibits that we thought

     5           the Government was proffering at a time before they narrowed

     6           the field.

     7                    The Government has not even moved the introduction

     8           of some of those which are clearly hearsay or otherwise

     9           inappropriate, so as to those --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, well, they're now moving,

    11           yeah.

    12                    MS. HEINS:  You may have them but they're -- we are

    13           agreed they are not part of any record to be considered in

    14           connection with the preliminary injunction motion.

    15                    As to the ones we still dispute, our main objections

    16           fall into two categories: one is hearsay and that would

    17           include, for example, the Meese Commission report.  It's

    18           offered for the truth of the assertions in there.  We

    19           vigorously dispute the truth of those assertions.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But if you want to write your

    21           objections, unless you wanted to stand up and say that and we

    22           have your objections and we have the -- I don't see how --

    23           you agree that nothing that we could do would mean that these

    24           exhibits don't get into the record, one way or the other.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They're not going to be purged from
                                                                           102

     1           the record.

     2                    MS. HEINS:  Well, they may be in the record but we

     3           would like an opportunity clearly to state our hearsay

     4           objections to some of them and, by the way, as to some of

     5           them, the Government does not dispute that they are not

     6           admissible for the truth of any assertions there.  And that

     7           would be the other category of things like the Internet

     8           Yellow Pages.  I think we're agreed that as to those, they

     9           are relevant only for purposes of showing the Court that

    10           there are books out there that purport to list sex.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's exactly the point, Ms.

    12           Heins, is that the Court surely knows that the statements in

    13           the Meese report are hearsay, okay?  I mean we really know

    14           what that is, we know it when we see it.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that being the case, for the

    17           life of me I just don't understand what your concern is.  We

    18           know to go through this there are hundreds of exhibits here. 

    19           Do you really want us to go through them one by one now?

    20                    MS. HEINS:  No.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As though there were a jury here?

    22                    MS. HEINS:  No, Judge Dalzell.  And in fact the

    23           areas of dispute are fairly small at this point.  As long as

    24           we are all agreed that the Meese Commission is hearsay and

    25           none of the assertions in it can be considered for their
                                                                           103

     1           truth, then the fact that it is physically a piece of paper

     2           in your chambers is irrelevant.  But I think that agreement

     3           has to be quite clear.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In the record.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's in the record, it's in the

     6           record.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And it would be in the record one

     8           way or the other.  Remember, this is a preliminary injunction

     9           hearing and for purposes of the preliminary injunction

    10           hearing we just find it difficult to understand why we would

    11           have to move, you know, strike any of this.

    12                    MS. HEINS:  Well, it may be in the record but--

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we could accept it as subject

    14           to your objections.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  There's a lot of exhibits,

    16           there's a lot of exhibits you object to here.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it does seem to me that from an

    18           appellate court standpoint, I always want to see what was

    19           proffered and it might be error not to have accepted some

    20           evidence or not, so it's got to be there.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, it seems to me you could

    22           continue to argue in your briefs why we should not consider

    23           certain exhibits in arriving at our decision, but all that we

    24           think is that the exhibits ought to be part of the record in

    25           any event for review by another court.
                                                                           104

     1                    MS. HEINS:  Well, they may be part of the record but

     2           I do think we are entitled to a ruling or an agreement that

     3           certain of them either are hearsay and therefore not to be

     4           considered for any assertions that are in them or, in the

     5           case of the Internet Yellow Pages, we are objecting simply

     6           because, number one, the selected excerpts that the

     7           Government has put in are obsolete, there is a new edition

     8           and, number two, they have been very selective.  And we would

     9           simply propose --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We are confident that you will so

    11           argue in your post trial.  I think that what we're going to

    12           do, we don't mean to deprive any of you of your 15 minutes in

    13           the sun, you've had more than that, we will do as we have

    14           done with all of the witnesses objections, we will accept the

    15           exhibits for what they are worth.  You can argue that they

    16           are worth nothing or they can argue that they are worth a

    17           great deal, but we see no reason after this lengthy

    18           preliminary injunction hearing with very lengthy exhibits and

    19           having seen the displays and everything else, we see no

    20           reason to go through seriatim these exhibits at this time.

    21                    MS. HEINS:  Well, again, just to make the record

    22           clear--

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    24                    MS. HEINS:  -- we have a very small number of

    25           disputes, we are not suggesting --
                                                                           105

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

     2                    MS. HEINS:  -- that the Court engage in any such

     3           burdensome task, as to the Internet Yellow Pages, as you can

     4           see, we have gone to the effort of buying the Court the

     5           entire Internet Yellow Pages.  We simply think it is improper

     6           for the Government to proffer obsolete copies of certain

     7           selected portions.  And they're heavy, we didn't bring one

     8           for each.  If I may  just --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, Mr. Coppolino?

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, she's made her argument three

    11           times and you've responded three times and I think the points

    12           are clear on both sides now.

    13                    MS. HEINS:  Well, if I may --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, let her make it for the

    15           record.

    16                    MS. HEINS:  -- please finish my sentence.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, go ahead.  I mean everybody

    18           has been really very cooperative up till now so we're going

    19           to continue in that vein.  Continue.

    20                    MS. HEINS:  I will try to be extremely brief.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    22                    MS. HEINS:  We simply think it is more appropriate

    23           for the Court to be aware that there are many books that call

    24           themselves the Internet Yellow Pages, we have brought two. 

    25           We will offer them.  We hope that the Court could share one
                                                                           106

     1           as opposed to taking all three.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, yes, we're in the same building

     3           purposefully, we are in the same building.

     4                    MS. HEINS:  I think that's more appropriate, these

     5           are the current editions, again not offered for the truth of

     6           the assertions in them.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are those the volumes right in front

     8           of you there?

     9                    MS. HEINS:  These are two different books purporting

    10           to call themselves the Internet Yellow Pages.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It looks to me like the Rules of

    12           Civil Procedure on top.

    13                    MS. HEINS:  That you don't get. 

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    MS. HEINS:  We also, another exhibit they have

    17           offered--

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Having helped to draft them, I can

    19           assure that they do not fall within the --

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21                    MS. KAPPLER:  Your Honor, if I may make a

    22           suggestion?

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, let her finish.

    24                    MS. KAPPLER:  I'm sorry.

    25                    MS. HEINS:  Another exhibit they have proffered is a
                                                                           107

     1           selected portion of a book called Net.Sex.  I could only find

     2           one of these in four New York book stores that I tried

     3           yesterday, but again we think the entire book should be

     4           considered by the Court and not just the section that the

     5           Justice Department has --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, now, wait a minute.  Mr. --

     7           are you finished?

     8                    MS. HEINS:  -- proffered and since I only have one,

     9           what I would suggest in this case is to give us an

    10           opportunity to go back to the office, Xerox it, the entire

    11           thing -- it's short unlike these -- and submit it to the

    12           Court afterwards.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, what we have right now is we

    14           have the Government having gotten up and offered, proffered

    15           into evidence, asked us to admit the Government's exhibits

    16           into evidence.  We have your objections.  If you want to

    17           proffer other things in purview of rebuttal, fine, but hold

    18           on, let's deal with what is in front of us at the moment.

    19                    Do you have anything that you want to add as

    20           objections to what the Government has proffered?

    21                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, your Honor, and two points I'd

    22           like to make.  This is Ann Kappler for the ALA plaintiffs.

    23                    First, just a suggestion for the Court's benefit, I

    24           think it might be helpful if we submitted a narrowly tailored

    25           essentially restatement of our objections because there are
                                                                           108

     1           now different documents that are being submitted.  They have

     2           one piece of paper that just has the ones on which we object

     3           to.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We absolutely will allow the

     5           plaintiffs, having cut you off somewhat in oral argument, we

     6           will certainly allow you to submit written objections to any

     7           of the exhibits proffered by the Government.

     8                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor.  I have one--

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay?  So that the record will be

    10           clear.  Yes?

    11                    MS. KAPPLER:  Excuse me, I have one second point and

    12           that is this morning we were handed a new document which I

    13           think is of a very different ilk and that is a second

    14           declaration of Howard Schmidt.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now that's a separate thing.  Let's

    16           hold that out.  We don't know, at the moment we're talking

    17           about exhibits.

    18                    MS. KAPPLER:  Well, they are submitting this as an

    19           exhibit, I mean that's how they denominate it, as an exhibit.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, we are dealing at the moment

    21           not with declarations, we're going to deal with declaration

    22           later.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's a separate issue, surely.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  So we agree that that's a

    25           separate issue. 
                                                                           109

     1                    MS. HEINS:  I have one other point, if I may.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     3                    MS. HEINS:  With respect to some of the exhibits

     4           that have been proffered and these are in fact exhibits that

     5           in Mr. Schmidt's original affidavit he attempted to

     6           authenticate.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, Mr. Schmidt is a -- is a

     8           separate -- Mr. Schmidt's documents I think are a separate

     9           category.  Right now we're dealing with all of the other

    10           exhibits separate from Mr. Schmidt.

    11                    MS. HEINS:  The reason I raised it now is these were

    12           exhibits that were not in Mr. Coppolino's book, but these

    13           were exhibits that were in the original three sets of

    14           Government cross-examination exhibits.  We were not given

    15           notice that these were exhibits Mr. Schmidt had downloaded

    16           and printed out, they were not produced to us at the

    17           deposition as part of the materials that the Government was

    18           telling us would be in what turned out to be the Coppolino

    19           book.  Instead they were cross-examination exhibits with no

    20           indication of where they came from or who downloaded them.

    21                    Schmidt in his declaration in Paragraph 39 purported

    22           to authenticate them in very vague terms.  We would object to

    23           their going in.  These again are cross-examination exhibits

    24           not in the Schmidt book, we would object to their going in,

    25           they're not authenticated.
                                                                           110

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Coppolino?

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  First of all, can we change the name

     3           of the book, your Honor?

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, let me just step back to

     6           indicate that -- a couple of things.  First of all, I have a

     7           pleading type document here which lists all of the exhibits

     8           that we would offer into evidence from all of the materials

     9           we have submitted over the past two weeks except for

    10           declarations and I would -- that would give the Court and it

    11           would give, as to the plaintiffs, we'd give you a full list.

    12                    Now, as I understand what the Court's been

    13           indicating then the weight of these exhibits, whatever

    14           evidentiary objections there are to them or our response to

    15           them would be handled in the briefing process.

    16                    In other words, if they consider a particular

    17           exhibit to be hearsay we could identify our response to that

    18           in the brief.  We're prepared to argue every one of their

    19           objections right now, the hearsay objections, whatever they

    20           might be, or any other concern.

    21                    If the Court prefers, however, we could simply deal

    22           with that in the -- in the brief.  If they think it's

    23           hearsay, if we think we've got a hearsay objection we could

    24           identify it.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  One second.
                                                                           111

     1                    (Discussion off the record.)

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think what the Court would like

     3           to do is that you -- all of these arguments can be made in

     4           connection with your post-trial submission, and you can now

     5           or later submit what you want, you can respond to it in

     6           writing.  We will have an opportunity to actually see the

     7           documents and see the -- you can then proffer your rebuttal

     8           exhibits if you want.  And on the day that your -- well, and

     9           in your writings, when you submit it with your post-trial

    10           submissions, you can include this separately or encompassed

    11           within it, and the Court will rule.  Okay?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That sounds fine, your Honor.  We

    13           would also --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right?

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As to everything.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  If it would assist the Court, we

    17           could also do just a separate submission on evidentiary --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You could.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You could, I think that would make

    20           sense.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That makes a lot of sense.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That would clarify it.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And do that at the time of the post-

    24           trial briefing.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Very well.
                                                                           112

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That makes a lot of sense, Mr.

     2           Coppolino.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I won't read the document, but

     4           I will -- we will submit it and file it.  The plaintiffs have

     5           it, it lists all of the things we would proffer, so rather

     6           than reading it, it's here in writing.  I would indicate it

     7           does include the Schmidt exhibits, as well as this additional

     8           item that Ms. Kappler referred to -- did the Court want to

     9           deal with that in the same manner or did it want to hear --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, here's what I think you ought

    11           to do is I would like you all, if possible, I'm sure my

    12           colleagues will agree, in the next day or two to sit down and

    13           try to narrow the areas of dispute, okay?  Bearing in mind

    14           what we have said to you not once, not twice, but many times

    15           throughout the five days of hearing here, what we're doing,

    16           and to take an intensely practical approach.  But if each

    17           side believes that there is a narrow universe of documents as

    18           to which admissibility is a truly significant issue and you

    19           can't agree on it then at the time of the post-trial

    20           submissions you can identify those exhibits for us, all

    21           right?  Does that make sense?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think it does and I --

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that all right with you,

    24           Colleagues?

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, yes --
                                                                           113

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, that's fine.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- fine.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, it does make sense and we have

     4           I think tried to do that... we have narrowed it down to about

     5           a dozen already.

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Maybe you can further narrow it

     7           down.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, what about the Schmidt

     9           declaration?

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There's a new declaration?

    11                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, your Honor.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.  Could I explain that?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, let's hear Mr. Coppolino

    14           first.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We were going to of course proffer

    16           the Schmidt -- all of the Schmidt exhibits, the one

    17           additional item which I was going to offer to the Court was

    18           in the course of Mr. Schmidt's cross-examination and

    19           questioning by the Court and redirect by me he went into an

    20           issue which was not present in his direct testimony

    21           concerning a key-word search, I think it was women pictures

    22           with Surfwatch running.  The issue came up as to whether or

    23           not Surfwatch would block sexually-explicit sites, and we

    24           described the tests he undertook by identifying specific

    25           sites.  Then under questioning he went into an issue of would
                                                                           114

     1           sites be identified through a key-word search and he

     2           specifically talked about women pictures.  He also indicated

     3           that he had downloaded that particular result.  What I was

     4           going to offer to the Court was that specific download with

     5           the declaration, which only authenticates it and says that I

     6           did it and this is what I did, and that's all that this is. 

     7           Now, I realize it is a new exhibit, it is --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It is very problematic also.

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It is not a part of the direct

    10           testimony, because that was not part of his direct testimony, 

    11           the door onto this subject was opened if you will on the

    12           cross-examination.  Now, if the Court considers it

    13           prejudicial we don't have to offer it.  He referred to it and

    14           I thought that the Court might want to see it.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you object?

    16                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, we sustain the objection.  I

    18           do --

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That only leaves the rest of the

    20           Schmidt notebook then to talk about, if there is anything to

    21           talk about.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you're going to do the same

    23           thing with the rest of the Schmidt notebook as you do with

    24           all of the other exhibits and they will father objections,

    25           and they may follow to all of the material, they may want to
                                                                           115

     1           object to part of it --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But first you're going to meet and

     3           try to resolve as much as possible.

     4                    MS. HEINS:  Would it be appropriate at this point to

     5           proffer the Internet yellow pages?

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, I think you should proffer

     7           them, except there's no wit -- is there anybody who --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, there could be a stipulation

     9           though.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Will you stipulate to the Internet

    11           yellow pages?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We have no objection if they want to

    13           submit the whole volume.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Admitted.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you can take it back --

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'd like to know what volume it is.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- and bring it back.  I don't know

    19           what --

    20                    MS. HEINS:  I'd rather not have to take it back --

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22                    MS. HEINS:  -- so I'd rather give it to you now. 

    23           And let me just point out that one of --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Take it up to Room 2609.

    25                    MS. HEINS:  -- one of them has a CD-Rom, which
                                                                           116

     1           purports to be a Web Browser; I haven't tried it, but --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't know how one would do --

     3           use it, so --

     4                    MS. HEINS:  -- it comes --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- this is not -- well, okay.  

     6                    Is that it?  Okay.  I want to thank -- yes, you're

     7           going to all see Judge Dalzell about the scheduling in 15

     8           minutes, but -- Mr. Ennis?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I believe that's the close of the

    10           Government's case, the Government has no further witnesses?

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The Government rests.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  We appreciate that the Court gave us the

    13           opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses for the plaintiffs,

    14           but as the Court has been informed we have waived calling any

    15           live rebuttal witnesses.  The only thing left that I am aware

    16           of for plaintiffs is we are -- we have filed these

    17           supplemental declarations of the non-trial affiants and that

    18           has been set aside for separate briefing.  I simply wanted to

    19           remind the Court that we will be relying on those

    20           supplemental declarations as well.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We are aware that they filed it and

    22           Judge Dalzell has allowed us an opportunity to object to that

    23           and he has given us dates for that, and that's what we'll be

    24           doing.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I do want to thank -- I think on
                                                                           117

     1           behalf of the entire Court, we do want to thank counsel for

     2           the expeditious manner in which they have handled this very

     3           lengthy, very long, very complex technologically and

     4           otherwise record.  I think that the cooperation is a credit

     5           to you as members of the profession and the Court is very

     6           grateful to all of you, and we will try to reciprocate.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And I'll see you in 15 minutes.

     8                    (Court adjourned at 12:20 o'clock p.m.)
