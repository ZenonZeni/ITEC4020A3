  <!-- --[ Insert the article text here ]-- -->


<P>     Strange, but true: Officials at the Statue of Liberty National Monument banned an
alternative health book even as our government attempts to make such treatment more
accessible to the American public (with legislation such as the Access to Medical
Treatment Act, House Bill H.R. 4696).


<P>     The scene of this incongruity is Ellis Island, where a museum exhibit depicted
traditional medicine and folk remedies from all over the world, as brought here by
the flood of immigrants early in this century. The exhibit displayed modern examples
of how these ancient practices are being used today-demonstrating the continued
popularity, if not the emerging scientific validation, for modern forms of old-world
treatments.


<P>     A couple of self-proclaimed &quot;quackbusters&quot; wrote letters of complaint.  The display
was promptly (and somewhat mysteriously) shut down. But this is a public facility,
and the exhibit was popular and noncontroversial. Even worse, a book offered for
sale by a private concessionaire in the museum gift shop was suddenly pulled from the
shelves.  The book singled out was our Alternative  Medicine: The Definitive Guide! 
So now they're attacking books along with vitamins and herbs.

<HR>

<P>     One of the quackbusters is a well-known enemy of alternative therapies.  We don't
know what motivates him or his allies. Perhaps it's misguided zealotry Perhaps it's
self-interest.  Perhaps there is some need to defend the pharmaceutical
establishment.


<P>     We're accustomed to seeing the constitution trampled when it comes to our right
to disseminate information on alternative medical practice. But in a museum
associated with the Statue of Liberty? Yes, folks, this really happened! Stand by as
you witness Future Medicine Publishing, along with the nutrition and publishing
industries, acting on your behalf against this travesty 

<P>God Bless,  Burton
Goldberg Publisher
