<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>


<P>Net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 1995 were US$1,349,000 (US$0.01 per share), compared to US$13,319,000 (US$0.08 per share) in the third quarter of 1994.  Net earnings for the nine month period were US$9,839,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$19,181,000 (US$0.12 per share) in the corresponding 1994 period. In 1994, the higher net earnings for both the first nine months and the third quarter reflect one time interest and foreign exchange gains which resulted principally from the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, the Real.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1995 was 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 111,100 ounces (88,900 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1994.  Year to date production was 311,100 gold equivalent ounces compared to 331,200 gold equivalent ounces in 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales during the third quarter of 1995 of 107,900 ounces was US$383 per ounce compared to US$373 per ounce on 96,800 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$218 from US$190, principally due to increased operating costs at certain mines and lower production at the North American operations and La Coipa. However, the improved revenue results at the La Coipa Mine reflect a draw down in inventories and higher realized revenues. The continued appreciation of the Brazilian currency accounted for higher costs during the period at the Company's Brazilian operations. 

<P>At the Mineral Hill Mine, third quarter production was in line with the comparable 1994 period, while year to date production was lower than 1994 reflecting the mining of lower grade ore as the main orebody reaches the end of its expected life. The newly identified Ski Slope zone, adjacent to the Mineral Hill orebody, is currently being developed and will provide continued production at a mining grade of 7.2 grams per tonne, until the completion of the Crevice tunnel project. Gold production at Casa Berardi was significantly lower than 1994 levels due to lower grade ores and an  increased emphasis on development and exploration.  

<P>The Company expects that improved production levels in the fourth quarter will result in average cash costs in 1995 of approximately US$215 per ounce.

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa Mine in Chile in the third quarter of 1995 was 46,700 ounces (32,700 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 53,500 ounces (31,300 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent  ounce basis for the period increased to US$169 as compared to US$157 in the same period of 1994. The increase in cash costs and the decrease in production are primarily due to the mining of lower head grades during the period.    

<P><B>CRIXÁS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixás Mine in Brazil was 16,500 ounces in the third quarter of 1995 compared to 17,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production is attributable to mining lower grade ore. However, throughput at the mill continues to exceed plan and the Crixás Mine is on target to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$164 compared to US$133 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crixás mine is primarily due to lower production in the period and the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. 

<P><B>BRASÍLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Brasília Mine in Brazil was 13,600 ounces in the third quarter compared to 9,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Brasília Mine effective January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$229 compared to US$151 for the corresponding 1994 period.  The increase in cash costs at the Brasília Mine is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  Production efficiencies are anticipated to improve in the first quarter of 1996 with the introduction of a fleet of 85 tonne trucks which will replace the 20 tonne trucks currently used.   

<P><B>NOVO ASTRO</B>

<P>The planned closure of the Novo Astro Mine in Brazil which reached the end of its mine life in June 1995 will be completed by year end 1995.  The 1,200 ounces of production registered in the quarter were the result of remnants recovered during mill clean up.

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill Mine in Montana, U.S.A. was 8,000 ounces in the third quarter compared to 8,800 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs for the period were US$392 compared to US$396 in the previous year. The advancement of the Crevice tunnel continues, however at a slower than anticipated rate, due to unexepected ground water encountered.  The Company's efforts at grouting in the tunnel drive have been successful and the tunnel is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1997.  The recently discovered Ski Slope Zone will be in production in the first quarter of 1996.  It is anticipated that, based on the Company's current information and ongoing drilling, the deposit will contribute sufficient production until the Crevice reserves are developed.   

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi Mine in Quebec, Canada was 8,300 ounces in the third quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$612 compared to US$227 in the previous year.  The increase in cash costs and decrease in production during the third quarter reflect the operational transition period encountered at the mine in which emphasis was placed on development of multiple feed sources. To accelerate this program, a contractor was retained.  The deep development program continues with shaft sinking completion scheduled for the fourth quarter.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>Officially opened, subsequent to the end of the quarter, on November 14, 1995.  

<P>The Company, as the operator of the project, maintained its construction schedule on target at its 50% owned New Britannia Mine in Manitoba, Canada.  During the period, long hole drilling of the No. 3 Zone orebody commenced along with development work at the 1,780 metre level.  Erection and completion of the primary crusher building occurred while the installation of mill equipment was finalized by mid-September.  By the end of September, crushed waste was fed into the fine ore bin in preparation for start-up.  The mill processing facilities are expected to operate on a 24 hour day, 365 days per year schedule at an operating availability of 96% and a rated throughput of 78 tonnes per hour to average 1,800 tonnes per day.  The crushing facility is expected to operate 12 hours per day.  The mill is expected to process 665,000 tonnes per annum, recovering approximately 100,000 ounces of gold.

<P>In anticipation of the official mine opening, the Honourable Gary Filmon, Premier of Manitoba, visited the site during the quarter.

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>Exploration work and feasibility studies continue at the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project in Ontario, Canada, with a  production decision expected in early 1996.  Total costs for the 1995 program are expected to be approximately $15 million and include the construction of a newly-completed 45 kilometre all-weather access road to the property and a feasibility study.  Preliminary indications are that this underground, shaft accessed property will be mined and milled at a rate of approximately 1.4 million tonnes of ore per annum to produce approximately 250,000 ounces of gold annually.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>At the Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, the underground drifting program continues on course to achieve 2,350 metres of total development.  Surface drilling results continue to confirm mineralized systems along strike.  Underground drilling work is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.  The Company is evaluating the continuance of further underground drifting and drilling plans for 1996, as findings to date remain positive, and in accordance with expectations.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>During the period, the Company realigned its drilling and exploration program at the Pachicutza project in Ecuador.  The initial exploration program focused on large tonnage, low grade zones which, to date, have proved to be uneconomic.  However, after careful consideration, the Company has switched its exploration program to smaller high grade zones.  Pending positive results from these zones, the Company anticipates commencing a feasibility study in 1996.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>ACQUISITION PROJECT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>Discussions aimed at the completion and signing of the contract to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, continue.  The Company remains confident that the transaction will soon close and the Greek government continues to affirm its support in this process.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 1995 was US$16.9 million, down from US$25.6 million in the corresponding period in 1994, as higher sales revenues were offset by higher cash costs of production and exploration spending during the 1995 period increased compared to the prior year period.  The higher overall cash flow in 1994 reflects the realization of one time interest and foreign exchange gains.  Improvements in working capital increased cash flow, principally as a result of the Company completing, during the quarter, the financing of the development of the New Britannia Mine.

<P>Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment remained relatively consistent at US$25.0 million in the third quarter of 1995 from US$27.3 million in the prior period.  Spending in 1995 was the result of requirements at the La Coipa, Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill mines, the development of the New Britannia Mine, costs related to acquiring new properties in Greece and the recently acquired interests in properties in Kamchatka, Russia.  Investments in other assets increased to US$11.2 million from US$1.5 million in 1994 as a result of strategic minority interest investments in publicly traded mining companies.

<P>Financing activities generated US$5.2 million in the quarter compared to US$2.3 million in the same period of 1994.  Cash generated from the issuance of share capital in the third quarter was significantly reduced as compared to the 1994 third quarter, as 1994 included shares issued for the acquisition of mining properties.  Net long-term debt financing resulted in an increase in cash of US$10.1 million as a result of the first draw down on the New Britannia Mine project financing completed during the third quarter.  The total facility is US$28 million, of which US$21.4 million had been received as of September 30.
