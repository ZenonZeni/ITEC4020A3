<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration
Reform Bills Flood Congress</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Senator Alan Simpson (R-Wyoming) introduced legislation to reduce illegal
immigration into the United States.  Key components of Simpson's reform package
include a counterfeit-resistant work identification card, further revisions to
the US system for considering requests for political asylum , and establishing
a fee on persons who cross the US-Mexican border, with the moneys collected to
beef-up border enforcement.  The maximum penalty for smuggling illegal aliens
into the US would be raised to imprisonment for 10 years, and  the death
penalty could be invoked if an immigrate dies as a result of coyote's
actions.<p>
<p>
Simpson's bill would also reduce the annual number of legal immigrants expected
from 675,000 to 500,000 for five years.  Simpson, one of the architects of 1986
immigration reforms, argues that because IRCA did not reduce illegal
immigration, the United States should now restrict legal immigration.
Simpson's bill would reduce the number of political refugees the US anticipates
resettling from  80,000 to 12,000 annually, unless Congress declares an
emergency. <p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the House Republican Task Force on Illegal Immigration has proposed
a $2 billion program that would lead to a tamper-proof Social Security card, a
$1.50 per person border crossing fee, and the elimination of all federal aid
for illegal immigrants. <p>
<p>
A coalition of nine California Democrats proposed its own package of
immigration reform legislation.  This proposal includes: increasing the Border
Patrol from 3,500 to 6,000 and upgrading its equipment and training; requiring
federal reimbursement of state and local costs of imprisoning undocumented
immigrants convicted of crimes;  tougher federal rules to protect US citizens
and legal immigrants from workplace discrimination; establishing a federal
review board to investigate civil rights abuses by federal agents; adding
resources to eliminate the backlog of aliens waiting to become naturalized US
citizens; and adding English and civics instruction classes for those seeking
to apply for U.S. citizenship.  FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, has denounced this proposal, charging that it will increase government
bureaucracy and tie the hands of the government in enforcement. <p>
<p>
Finally, California Governor Pete Wilson (R) in a March 16, 1994 speech to the
Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC repeated his demand that the federal
government to reimburse states for the costs they incur to provide education
and medical services, as well as to incarcerate illegal immigrants. Wilson
argues that ''The Constitution of the United States is clear -- the regulation
of  immigration,  legal and illegal, is exclusively a federal responsibility.
And it's simply not fair for the federal government to force a state to bear
the costs of educating someone or providing emergency health care to someone
who is in the country because of federal failure to control the border.'' (p.
A4)<p>
<p>
In California, signatures are being collected to put two immigration control
initiatives on the November ballot.  The first initiative, sponsored by two
former Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, would prevent the US
non-citizen children of illegal immigrants from attending without charge public
schools and receiving taxpayer-funded health and welfare services; it has been
endorsed by the Republican Party.  This initiative also calls for stiffer
penalties for false ID cards and increased cooperation between government
agencies to enforce immigration laws.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
Contributes to Inequality</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
President Clinton's first Economic Report of the President asserted that
growing income inequality in the US is "a threat to the social fabric."
Included in the list of factors responsible for growing economic disparities
are new technologies, diminished union strength, a falling real minimum wage,
and immigration.  Because "immigration has increased the relative supply of
less educated labor...[it]appears to have contributed to the increasing
inequality of income, but the effect has been small."(p120)<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Eliminating
SSI for Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A White House Task Force is considering a proposal that would deny Supplemental
Security Income benefits to elderly legal immigrants unless they become US
citizens.  Illegal immigrants are not eligible for SSI benefits.  The SSI
program is a major source of support for needy elderly legal immigrants, since
many do not qualify for Social Security benefits because they did not work in
the United States. <p>
 <p>
The number of immigrants receiving SSI has increased from 128,000 in 1982 to
601,000 in 1993.  About 150,000 new applications for SSI are received from
legal aliens each year.  Two-thirds of the immigrant SSI recipients are
elderly, reflecting the tendency of some immigrants who have become US citizens
to bring their parents into the country, and then have their parents apply for
SSI.  The number of parents who immigrate to join their children in the US has
increased from 40,000 in 1985 to 65,000 in 1993.  By not permitting immigrants
to obtain SSI, AFDC and Food Stamp benefits until they become US
citizens--meaning they must wait at least 5 years--the  Task Force estimates
savings of over $1.2 billion per year. <p>

Quake Aid for Legal Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Applicants for housing assistance in the wake of the January 1994 Southern
California earthquake will be spot checked by immigration officials to ensure
that illegal immigrants do not receive aid, in the first ever denial of
humanitarian aid on the basis of immigration status.  Initially the Federal
Emergency Management Agency wanted to rely solely on the honor system to
determine immigration status, but Congress insisted that applicants make a
formal declaration of their immigration status and show identity documents.
False statements carry penalties of imprisonment and fines.  <p>
<p>
However, the US House of Representatives defeated a measure by Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) that would have denied tuition-free federal
elementary and secondary education to illegal immigrant children. The House
rejected Rohrabacher's proposal that would have required public schools to
report the immigration status of students and their parents. <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Canada
Revises Nanny Immigration</a> 
</a></h2>
<p>
On March 16, 1994, Canada reduced the requirements for immigrant nannies.
April 1992 rules required nannies to prove that they had completed at least a
six month training course before being admitted as nannies; the March 16, 1994
revision lowers the requirement to a 12th grade education and 12 months
experience as a maid.  After two years of work as a domestic, a foreign worker
may apply for permanent or landed immigrant status.<p>
<p>
Before the training requirement in 1991, some 7,835 domestic workers--mostly
Filipinos--were admitted.  In 1993, the number of Filipinos admitted dropped
from 5,323 to 779.  Since most domestics apply for immigrant status after
serving what some describe as a two year "jail term," the government felt
obliged to toughen the rules when it realized that there were over 1,200
unemployed domestics--mostly immigrants--in Toronto alone.<p>

Stricter border enforcement in California and Texas seems to have pushed

last year.  San Diego and El Paso still account for more than 70 percent of
illegal crossings. <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Immigration
Costs in Texas and Florida</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Rice University economist Donald Huddle estimates that legal and illegal
immigration cost the state of Texas more that $4.68 billion in 1992, i.e.,
state and local governments incurred $4.68 billion more in costs than 1.9
million immigrants who arrived in the state since 1970 paid in taxes to state
and local governments.  According to Huddle, illegal immigrants cost Texas,
$1.02 billion,  legal immigrants $3.66 billion. <p>
<p>
Urban Institute demographer Jeff Passel re-examined Huddle's estimates and
found that, because Huddle does not include the taxes that accrue to
governments immigrants indirectly create job for Americans, and ignores the
taxes paid as immigrants purchase food and housing, he underestimates their tax
contributions.  The Urban Institute has received a White House grant to
estimate state costs associated with illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
In Florida, the Governor's Office and the Florida Advisory Council on
Intergovernmental Relations prepared a report, "The Unfair Burden,
Immigration's Impact on Florida."  It estimates that the state's 340,000
illegal immigrants cost the government $884 million a year for education,
housing and justice costs.  <p>

Smuggled to U.S. Via Thailand</a>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service reported that a major Chinese triad
is smuggling thousands of illegal aliens into the U.S. via Thailand.  The triad
provides Chinese immigrants with fake travel documents and housing in Thailand
before they are brought to the U.S. by air or sea. The U.S. government
estimates that as many as 80,000 Chinese immigrants passed through Bangkok on
their way to the U.S. last year.  Chinese who want to immigrate to the U.S. pay
up to $30,000 in cash or credit.<p>

to Wisconsin</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The effects of the immigration of Southeastern Asian refugees to Wausau,
Wisconsin is discussed in an article in the April 1994 Atlantic Monthly. The
community welcomed refugees in the 1970s, but now blames them for many of the
social ills that plague the city, including such as school busing and gang
violence. <p>
<p>
The fact that the refugees are poor and minority has aggravated tensions.
Seventy percent of them, primarily members of the Hmong mountain hill tribes,
are still receiving public assistance, and their children are almost a quarter
of the elementary schoolchildren. <p>
<p>
The refugees were brought to Wausau by area churches in the 1970s.  The first
refugees settled, and then invited their extended family members to join them
in Wisconsin. <p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Temporary
Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
An appellate court ruling will make it easier for employers to hire an alien if
no Americans are qualified or available for the job. The court eliminated a US
Department of Labor rule that required employers to repeat the application
procedure if one foreign worker is replaced by another. <p>
<p>
In New England, the US Department of Labor warned apple growers that the job
order they planned to file to search for American workers before being given
permission to recruit H-2A foreign workers for the 1994 harvest may violate US
civil rights laws because they state that the growers prefer " male workers
aged 22-40" who are "free from physical impairments ...which would make the
individual unable to meet quality or quantity standards."  In addition, the job
order states that workers willing to work six days per week are preferred, as
well as those that have experience working on "mainland" US farms and without
relatives in New England. <p>
<p>
The New England Apple Council Inc. in 1993 recruited 400 US workers, and 2,000
H-2A foreign workers to pick apples.  The Farmworker Justice Fund Inc. attacked
the Council's job description, calling it "blatantly illegal " because, inter
alia, the growers provided no evidence that hearing-impaired workers are unable
to pick apples, or that workers under 22 or over 40 should be discouraged from
applying.<p>
<p>
In New York, an apple grower paid $10,000 to 10 US citizen workers to settle a
complaint brought under IRCA in which the workers charged that they were fired
to make room for H-2A workers.  <p>

A hunger strike by about one-half of the 200 asylum seekers at the Campsfield

There have also been complaints about detention centers in France and Spain.

which jointly determine when to deport aliesn, have agreed on the
postponement.<p>

The first deportations of 60,000 rejected asylum seekers from Serbia,
Montenegro and Kosovo were also postponed due to a breakdown in negotiations
with Romania.  In March, 640 such persons were to be flown to Romania and then
bussed to Serbia. <p>
<p>
The High Administrative Court in Schleswig, Germany ruled that Albanians from
Kosovo are entitled to asylum in Germany due to "collective persecution by the
Serbs."  Ninety percent of the people in Kosovo are Albanian, although all are
legally Serbian citizens. The administrative courts of the States of North
Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg are denying asylum to Albanians
from Kosovo, ruling that they are not being persecuted for ethnic reasons. This
example demonstrates that, in Germany, individual states have control over the
rules governing who is granted asylum. <p>

In a related development, Switzerland will on July 1, 1994 introduce new
legislation that allows the imprisonment of aliens for up to 9 months if they

<a name="RTFToC21">Hong
Kong and the Migration Transition</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Cornell Economist Gary Fields in 1993 wrote an influential paper which argued
that both the rate and the distribution of economic growth influence a
country's migration transition from labor exporter to importer.  Asian nations
that attracted foreign investment to build factories from which labor-intensive
goods could be exported, he argued, initially created jobs at then prevailing
low wages,  but soon reached full employment, which permitted manufacturing
wages to rise.  <p>
<p>
In the virtuous circle that characterized Asian NIE development, these
manufacturing wage gains were shared with rural workers.  Manufacturing wages
in Taiwan, for example,  were only 20 percent higher than agricultural wages in
the 1970s, versus 100 percent higher in Mexico.<p>
<p>
Field's analysis suggests that the migration transition can be speeded up with
urban-led economic, job, and wage growth that is broadly shared throughout a
developing society.  Integrated and flexible labor markets are, in his view, as
important as growth and job creation per se in affecting migration.<p>
<p>
Ron Skeldon, a University of Hong Kong geographer<b>,</b> showed that Hong
Kong's experience is almost exactly the opposite of what would have been
expected on the basis of Field's analysis.  Hong Kong experienced significant
immigration despite unemployment in the 1950s.  In 1960, for example, the
number of street peddlers or hawkers--one measure of unemployment--was 50,000,
or equivalent to one-fourth of the manufacturing workforce.  <p>
<p>
During the 1970s, despite jobs and higher wages in Hong Kong, emigration rose,
peaking at over 25,000 in 1973, largely because Canada did not start to
restrict access until 1977.  However, emigration reached its highest ever
levels in 1990, when over 62,000 largely professional residents left.  At the
same time, real wages were rising in Hong Kong, and employers there complained
of labor shortages across the skill spectrum from maids to construction workers
to accountants.<p>
<p>
Skeldon concluded that the Hong Kong migration transition demonstrates that
economic factors such as jobs and wages are just one reason for migration.
Indeed, he notes that many of today's emigrants may actually be binational
commuters.  Some have an immigrant status in Canada, but spend much of their
working time in Hong Kong that they are referred to as "astronauts" because of
the amount of time they spend in the air.   Skeldon concludes that the Hong
Kong experience demonstrates dramatically the importance of policy and
political factors in explaining migration patterns.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong has been dealing with labor shortages in several ways.  Most
important is the relocation of low-wage manufacturing jobs to nearby Guandong,
China.  According to Skeldon, Hong Kong-based manufacturers have three million
employees there, or four to five times their Hong Kong workforces.  Guandong,
in turn, is attracting migrants from other parts of China:  almost two-thirds
of the one million residents of the city of Shenzhen in Guangdong in 1990 were
immigrants who had arrived within the past 12 months or had their registration
elsewhere in China.  In this way, internal migration within China has in part
substituted for labor migration to Hong Kong.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong also has several programs under which 80,000 to 90,000 immigrants
arrive each year.  About one-third are relatives from China who are joining
family members in Hong Kong--an average 105 Chinese daily are permitted to
settle in Hong Kong.  Another 10,000 to 12,000 are PTK migrant workers.
Finally, the Hong Kong government announced a program to admit up to 25,000
temporary workers for up to six years on renewable two-year work permits, plus
5,500 migrant construction workers.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong has announced a plan to recruit 1,000 mainland Chinese to fill
professional and managerial vacancies in Hong Kong.  Graduates of 36 mainland
universities will be eligible to take jobs in Hong Kong, and a ballot system
will be used to allocate them to Hong Kong employers.   They will be issued a
one-year visas, renewable for first two years, then another two years, and
finally three years.  Their dependents will not be permitted to join them in
Hong Kong. <p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Illegal
Immigrants in Thailand</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Thailand has more than 500,000 illegal immigrants, described by the Thai
government as foreign workers and gangsters.  Most (300,000) are believed to be
from Myanmar (Burma), China (100,000), and South Asia (50,000).  Most of the
immigrants from Myanmar are unskilled construction workers, who are hired
because they are willing to accept low wages.  The Cambodians generally work in
rice paddies, and the Laotians find domestic and factory work. There are also
immigrants from the Indian sub-continent and Middle East who enter Thailand
legally, and then overstay their visas. <p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Philippine
Immigration Crackdown</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Philippine government has ordered a crackdown on the estimated 100,000
foreigners who have been living illegally in the country for more than three
years--there is a reward of 2,000 pesos for every illegal immigrant turned in.
Most are Chinese and Indian nationals. The Manila Chronicle estimates that
there are about 500,000 illegal immigrants in the country. <p>
<p>
The government is also firing corrupt employees in the immigration bureau.  It
is believed that many foreigners were overstaying their visas because of
connivance of some bureau officials and employees. <p>
<p>
Indians in the Philippines have complained that the crackdown has permitted
Immigration authorities to extort money from them.  Current Philippine
immigration laws reportedly permit an Indian to obtain legal immigrant status
for 3,500 pesos. There are about 20,000 Indians in the Philippines, most of
them Sindhis who left after the British partitioned India. There is also a
large Sikh community, m any of whom have traditionally been rural
money-lenders. <p>

<a name="RTFToC24">Malaysia:
 A Special Report</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Malaysian government estimated that 50,000 mostly illegal Indonesians left
the country during the March 14-15 Hari Raya festival that marks the end of
Ramadan.  According to Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid, the federal police
crackdown known as Ops Nyah II was largely responsible for these "voluntary"
exits.  Under Ops Nyah II, the Immigration Department arrested 54,155 illegal
aliens between July 1992 and December 1993. <p>
<p>
According to Malaysian authorities, most of the illegal aliens in the country
are foreigners who pay bogus job agencies in their home countries for what the
worker may believe to be a valid work permit and job.  The mostly Indonesian
and Filipino workers are then brought into the country illegally, and issued
false work permits--the cost of illegally crossing the 20 mile Strait of
Malacca that separate Indonesian Sumatra from Peninsular Malaysia is reportedly
less than US$10.<p>
<p>
Many Malaysian employers of foreign workers are labor contractors in the
plantation and construction sectors.  They argue that some of the foreign
workers arrested by Malaysian police during worksite raids are in fact legal
workers, and that only a slow government bureaucracy--it can take six to eight
months from the time an employer applies for foreign workers until they
arrive-- makes the workers only technically illegal.  They note that Malaysian
employers were certified to need 425,000 foreign workers between July 1, 1992
and December 31, 1993, but that only 190,000 work permits were actually
issued.<p>
<p>
In January 1994, Malaysia announced a freeze on the further admission of
unskilled and semi-skilled immigrant workers.  However, Malaysia has continued
to permit employers to hire illegal alien workers who were in the country
before the freeze was announced.  Malaysian employers whose need for foreign
workers has been certified are allowed to hire the 4,866 illegal aliens in who
were being held in eight detention centers in February, 1994.<p>
<p>
Malaysia is engaged in a debate over how to control illegal immigration into
one of Asia's fastest-growing economies that is already at full employment.
Malaysia already has an employer sanctions law, but enforcement authorities
have admitted that there goal is to "punish illegal workers, not Malaysian
employers." Many Malaysian employers reportedly believe the labor agents, who
bring most of the foreign workers into the country, when they are told that the
workers are legal, and the agent is simply keeping their work permits for
safekeeping.<p>
<p>
 There are apparently few fines levied against employers who hire illegal
aliens, although in April 1994, the Malaysian Parliament is expected to approve
amendments to the sanctions law that would increase fines on employers who hire
illegal immigrants from M$5,000 (US $2500) to M$50,000 (US $2500), and permit
them to be caned, as in Singapore. <p>
<p>
<i>Background  </i><p>
<i></i>Malaysia is a fast-growing country of 19 million in southeast Asia that
ranks among the world's top immigration destinations.  However, Malaysia is
unique because it is a significant exporter and importer of unskilled migrant
workers.  Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in Malaysia range from
200,000 to two million, and center on 1.2 million, while over 100,000
Malaysians work in Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan.  <p>
<p>
The Malaysian government's policies toward immigration and emigration have
changed significantly in recent years.  The 1968 Employment Restrictions Act,
which required Malaysian employers to get work permits for non-citizen workers,
resulted in thousands of Indian and Chinese plantation workers being forced to
leave the country.  However, as manufacturing employment expanded in the 1980s,
the gap between real wages in agriculture and manufacturing widened from one to
two in 1967 to one to three in 1981.<p>
<p>
Plantation owners complained of labor shortages--40 percent claimed that they
lost rubber and palm oil production in the early 1980s because of insufficient
labor.  The government "tolerated" the growing number of illegal alien workers
on plantations, and permitted contractors to use foreign workers to clear land
for resettlement programs on which native Malays (Bumipatra) were to be
resettled after foreign workers had prepared rubber and palm oil estates for
them.  <p>
<p>
The number of illegal aliens rose to "crisis" proportions in the mid-1980s.
The Malaysian government responded by stepping up border and interior
enforcement, and making agreements in 1984-5 with Indonesia and the
Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to recruit legal foreign
workers in the event of labor shortages.  <p>
 <p>
<i>Current Programs</i><p>
<i></i>Under the government's current foreign worker program, employers try to
recruit Malaysian workers by advertising for them and working with local
Employment Service offices to find local workers.  If local workers are not
available, the Ministry of Human Resources certifies the employer's need for
foreign workers, and "Registered Agents" or labor contractors provide the names
of the Indonesians or Bangladeshis who will be brought to Malaysia.   <p>
<p>
Foreign workers receive one-year work permits, which can be renewed. They are
required to obtain Immigration Department approval to change jobs or employers.
The penalty for violating these regulations is a maximum fine of $M 10,000
(US$2500), or five years imprisonment, or both.  In 1993, 8,893 foreigners were
detained for violating the terms of their visas and 4,925 were deported after
serving their sentences.<p>
<p>
Malaysia may imitate neighboring Singapore and refine the levy system it now
uses to discourage reliance on foreign workers--Malaysian employers must in
most cases pay $RM 420 per year--by adding sector-by-sector limits on foreign
workers.  In response to a question, Singapore Labour Minister Lee Boon Yang
noted that the 200,000 foreign workers in Singapore are 12 percent of the
workforce of 1.6 million, and that Singapore is unlikely to be able to
completely phase out  foreign workers because of the slower indigenous
workforce growth and the rapidly aging population.  <p>
<p>
Singapore regulates foreign worker employment with an annual levy--highest for
unskilled workers--and per firm ceilings that vary from industry to industry.
However, employers can have the levy rebated on foreign trainees--the lower of
100 foreigners or 10 percent of a company's workforce-- who are in the country
for up to six months. Singapore has 65,000 foreign maids, and is debating
measures--including random inspections-- to protect them from abuse.<p>

Immigrants Ordered Out of Nigeria</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Illegal immigrants in Nigeria must obtain residence permits by June 1994 or
leave the country, the Nigerian Immigration Department announced in March.
After the June deadline, all illegal aliens will be deported.  In 1985, Nigeria
forced one million immigrants, primarily Ghanians, out of the country.
Immigration officials estimate that about 300,000 illegal immigrants, mostly
from Chad, Niger, Benin and Cameroon, live in Lagos.  Border controls have been
tightened to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country. <p>
<p>
The Nigerian Internal Affairs Minister also announced new efforts to regulate
the employment of foreigners. Foreign experts cannot be recruited if qualified
Nigerians are available, and the residence permits of expatriates will no
longer be renewed automatically. The Ministry of Labor estimates that 1.5
million skilled Nigerians are unemployed. <p>

Miroslav Macura, Chief, PAU/DEAP/UN/ECE, Room 470, Paiais des Nations, CH-1211
Geneva 10.  <p>
<p>
This bulletin, issued in May and November, is produced with the support of the
UNFP to highlight current migration developments in Europe.  The highlights of
this issue, which reached California in March, 1994, include:  in October,1993
there were an estimated five million refugees and displaced persons in the
former Yugoslavia, and 85 percent remained inside its borders.  Over half of
the five million were in Bosnia.  The number of asylum applicants expected in
Europe in 1993 was projected to fall by 50,000 to 100,000 below the 1992 level
of 821,000.<p>
<p>
There are new "transit migrations" into the Czech Republic (36,071 persons were
detained during the first 10 months of 1993), Hungary, and Poland(15,248
persons were detained during the first 9 months of 1993) of persons attempting
entry into Western Europe.  The French Parliament on August 24, 1993 adopted a
new law that tightens the conditions under which dependents and spouses of
French nationals and resident foreigners can join them in France.  For example,
a foreign spouse of a French national must now live in France for one year
before being able to acquire an independent residence permit.<p>

Hollifield, James.  1994. "The Migration Crisis in Western Europe:  Causes and
Consequences," to appear in the Summer issue of the Harvard International
Review.  The issue will include articles devoted to immigration issues in
France by Hollifield and two French Ministers who have opposing views on what
France should do about immigration:  Simone Veil, Social Affairs, and Charles
Pasqua, Interior.<p>
<p>
Hollifield's paper surveys the migration debate in Western Europe and makes
comparisons with the US debate.  Hollifield notes that demand-pull labor
recruitment and de colonization started most of the migrations into northern
Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, and then networks permitted supply-push poverty
and joblessness in emigration countries to maintain migration's momentum.  In
the 1980s and 1990s, this was manifested as asylum and refugee migration.<p>
<p>
Hollifield reviews political responses to anti-immigration opinion, policy
changes, and the search for and evolution of national and international models
to manage migration.  In fairly detailed country studies, Hollifield shows that
ruling governments have taken what have proven to be largely symbolic steps to
diffuse anti-immigrant sentiment without really slowing the influx of
immigrants.  The internal dynamics of migration networks evolve, as do labor
markets and firm employment practices in industrial countries, so that
migration takes on a life of its own.<p>

Dominque Schnapper, writes on "Migrants and Foreigners in France" in Vol 2 No 1
of People and Place, a quarterly publication of the Australian Forum for
Population Studies.  According to Schnapper, there were 3.6 million foreigners
recorded in the 1990 census, up slightly from 3.5 million in 1982.  This
obscures the fact that there were about 100,000 immigrants in both 1990 and
1991; the net increase in the foreign population is low because almost as many
acquired French citizenship each year. <p>
