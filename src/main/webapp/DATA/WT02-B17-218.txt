<a name="intro"><H3>Introduction</H3></a>

<P> 

In 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in mercury.

Since then scientists have been trying to explain this strange

phenomenon.  Additional applications are being sought to take advantage

of the remarkable power superconductivity holds.

<P>

The future of science lies in interesting young people in exploring

the yet unexplained.  As teachers we must compete with the "television"

generation and present interesting new concepts in the classroom.

Superconductivity and cryogenics may not be commonly explored

in the middle school/junior high curriculum.  This booklet presents

you with some basic information to supplement the material presented

in the accompanying video tape.  The activities are designed for

groups of one to four students.  If small groups are difficult

to organize in your situation, they can also be used for class

presentation.

<P>

I hope that you find information that is useful in the classroom

and the laboratory.  Many of the questions proposed to the student

are open-ended and may result in a variety of answers.  If the

information provided challenges the student to ask why, then 
superconductivity

and cryogenics can open a new generation to one of the wonders

of science.

<P>

<B>Note:</B> As with many materials used in science classes, using

liquid nitrogen has some inherent dangers.  You should read the

section on handling and storing liquid nitrogen carefully and

experiment with it before distributing it to students.  You may

also want to consider its dangers before organizing groups.

<P>

An excellent booklet "A Teacher's Guide to Superconductivity

for High School Students" was written by Robert W. Dull and

H. Richard Kerchner.  It provides a more in-depth look at 
superconductivity

and has an excellent reference section and glossary.  If it was

<a name="charac"><H3>Characteristics of Liquid Nitrogen</H3></a>

<P>

Liquid nitrogen is manufactured by cooling air to a temperature

of 77 Kelvin (K).  Nitrogen makes up about 79% of the air we breathe.

Liquid nitrogen is very common and easy to obtain, if you know

where to look.  It is used by hospitals, doctors, universities,

factories, welding shops, and cattle breeders.

<P>

To obtain liquid nitrogen, look in the yellow pages under Liquid

Air or Gas- Industrial, Medical, etc.  You may also be able to

obtain it from a hospital, dermatologist, welding shop, or clinic.

Liquid nitrogen usually costs less than $1 per liter, even in

small quantities.  A supplier may have a minimum charge of $10

or so for a small quantity because of the loss due to boil-off

when filling a small container.

<P>

You may notice large trucks transporting liquid nitrogen on the

highways.  Industries that use large amounts of liquid nitrogen

may have their own compressors, liquefiers, and dewars that hold

several hundred liters of liquid nitrogen.  A dewar is a specially

insulated container for storing very cold liquids.  It is similar

to a vacuum-insulated glass thermos bottle.  Large dewars may keep

liquid nitrogen for several months.  Doctors offices' commonly

store liquid nitrogen in 10-20 liter dewars that hold liquid nitrogen

for up to a month before it boils away.

<P>

You can use a <U>common thermos bottle</U> to store liquid nitrogen

for 24-48 hours <B>but <U>only</U> with a vented or partially-sealed

lid.</B> Insulated plastic containers may crack due to thermal

shock.  They can even explode into many small projectiles of frozen

plastic.

<P>

When first observing liquid nitrogen, you may notice that it seems

to be boiling.  Since our common experiences tell us that boiling

liquids must be hot, we may assume that it is hot also.  The first

observation is indeed true, the liquid nitrogen is boiling.  However,

it is not hot, it is extremely cold.  Its boiling point is 77 K

(- 321&#176:F).

<P>

Because liquid nitrogen is <B>boiling</B> and is <B>extremely

cold</B>, we must use special precautions when handling and storing

liquid nitrogen.

<P>

<a name="teachguide"><H3>Teacher's Guide to Handling and Storing Liquid Nitrogen</H3></a>

<P>

This section contains background information about safety and

storage of liquid nitrogen.  It contains more detailed information

than the student section on safety.  This is not intended as a

comprehensive guide but will provide you with a reasonable amount

of information about the dangers of liquid nitrogen.

<P>

<B>Transporting Liquid Nitrogen</B>

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule 1:</I></b> Avoid transporting liquid nitrogen in the 
passenger

compartment of the car, if possible.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> There is no inherent danger in using the passenger

compartment.  However, if the liquid spills, several things could

happen:

<P>

1.  It could spill in the seat and freeze your skin through your

clothes.<br>

2.  It could freeze and crack the seat, carpet, and other parts

of the car (especially plastic parts).<br>

3.  It could reach your feet and freeze your shoes and/or skin.<br>

4.  The "fog" from a large spill could obscure your vision.<br>

5.  If the driver attempts to upright a spilled container, an accident

could result from inattention to driving.<br>

6.  The pure nitrogen gas in a closed passenger compartment could

result in a serious oxygen deficiency, even asphyxiation.

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> Transport the liquid in the trunk of your car

away from materials it could damage if spilled.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule 2:</I></b> Use some method to keep the liquid nitrogen


from spilling when transporting it.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> See Rule #1 for damage that can be caused.

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> Store the dewar or thermos in a box that cannot

be easily tipped over.  Pack around the dewar or thermos with paper

or other material to keep it from tipping over.  Be sure to use

some material that will not be damaged if the liquid nitrogen

should spill or slosh out.

<P>

<B>Storing Liquid Nitrogen</B> 

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #1:</I></B> Never store liquid nitrogen in a closed 
container.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> When the liquid is boiling, it is giving off

nitrogen gas and can develop extremely high pressures in a closed

container.  The container will develop enough pressure to explode!

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> <U>Be sure the dewar or thermos bottle is properly

vented</U>.  You can vent an ordinary thermos by drilling a 3/16"

to 1/4" hold in the lid and cap.  A stopper made from polyurethane

foam can also be used as a temporary stopper.  This foam is porous

and will allow the gas to escape but will help prevent loss if

tipped over.  If the foam becomes saturated with liquid nitrogen,

handle it with gloves until it has all drained or evaporated.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #2:</I> </b>Never store liquid nitrogen in an open 
container

for a long period of time.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> Nitrogen has a lower boiling point than oxygen.

If air can get into the container easily, the nitrogen can cool

the air and liquid oxygen could accumulate in the bottom of the

container.  Before long you could be pouring oxygen from the container.

Oxygen is a key component required for combustion, and pure oxygen

can make a piece of wood burn explosively.

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> Use a container with only a small opening to

allow the nitrogen gas to escape or one with a gas-penetrable

polyurethane stopper.  You may also use a rubber stopper with one

hole in it.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #3:</I></b> Never use liquid nitrogen in a 
tightly-closed

room.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> The liquid nitrogen could cause oxygen deprivation

if used for a long period of time in a tightly-closed room.  A

spill of 30 liters quickly expands (by a factor of 7/0) to 750

cubic feet.

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> Use only with adequate ventilation.

<P>

<H3>Handling Liquid Nitrogen</H3> 

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule#1</I>:</b> Read and <U>understand</U> all safety rules


before using liquid nitrogen.

<P>

<B>Rationale: </B>Frostbite will occur when liquid nitrogen contacts

<U>any</U> part of the body.  The longer the contact, the deeper

the damage due to frostbite.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #2:</I> </b>Wear safety glasses or safety goggles at 
all

times when using liquid nitrogen.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> Liquid nitrogen could quickly damage the eyes

and eyelids.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #3:</I> </b>Wear appropriate clothing when using 
liquid

nitrogen.</B> 

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> Liquid nitrogen and the very cold objects in

contact with it must be kept from prolonged contact with the skin.

If spilled, it can accumulate in the folds of clothes, shirt tails,

shoes, and even some gloves.

<P>

<B>Solution: </B>Wear a lab coat when using liquid nitrogen.  Long

pants can help control lap spills but standing up when using liquid

nitrogen is an even better idea.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule#4:</I></b>  Avoid all skin contact with liquid 
nitrogen.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> The liquid nitrogen and objects cooled in it

can cause frostbite.

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> Never touch the liquid nitrogen or reach in it

to retrieve objects.  Gloves should be used when handling objects

that have been removed from the liquid nitrogen.  The gloves should:

<P>

<MENU>1.  Not absorb the liquid easily.<br>

2.  Be easy to remove quickly in case some liquid nitrogen is spilled

into the glove.<br>

3.  Never be immersed in the liquid nitrogen-use plastic tweezers

or forceps to retrieve objects from the liquid.  Steel forceps

are useful for handling heavier objects.</MENU>

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #5:</I></b> Use care not to drop or cause sudden shock


to materials cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures.

<P>

<B>Rationale:</B> Objects cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures

can become brittle.  They may shatter and send pieces of material

flying or stick to your skin if touched.  Avoid common glass and

plastic.  Remember that if a material shatters like glass, it may

also cut like glass.

<P>

<B>Solution:</B> Allow any material removed from the liquid nitrogen

to warm to room temperature before handling.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #6:</I></b>  Any material cooled in liquid nitrogen 
should be allowed to warm to room temperature before touching it.

<P>

<B>Rationale: </B>Materials, especially metal, will stay very

cold for a long time when removed from the liquid nitrogen.  If

you touch the material with bare skin, you could easily get frostbite.

<P>

<B>Solution: </B>Allow materials to warm to room temperature or use 
gloves, plastic tweezers, or plastic forceps when handling

them.

<P>

<B><I>Safety Rule #7:</I></b>  Always have a plan for what the students 
can or should do should you leave the room.

<a name="tempscale"><H3>Temperature Scales</H3></a>

<P>

You may remember from one of your science classes that matter

exists in three states-solid, liquid, and gas.  A fourth state-plasma,

has also been discovered and is being studied.  With most materials

the temperature determines the material's state.  For example,

if water is below 32&#176;F., it is ice- a solid; above 212&#176:F.  and


it changes to steam-a gas; and of course at room temperature it's

a liquid.

<P>

One thing we commonly do is heat water until it begins to boil

which produces steam.  Let's think of the opposite for a minute.

How could we change steam to liquid? Cool it, of course.  Air 
conditioners

often drip water out the bottom-water that has been condensed

(changed from a gas to a liquid) by the cold coils of the air

conditioner.  To do an experiment we can capture some of the steam

in a closed container (being careful not to burn ourselves) and

wait for it to cool to room temperature.  Or we could put the container

in contact with some ice cubes or into refrigerator to speed the

process.

<P>

If we put the water in the freezer, it would change to ice.  One

important thing to remember here is that at room temperature,

the water will not burn or freeze us.  However, if the water is

very hot (steam) or very cold (ice) it can damage our skin.  We

are going to work with liquid nitrogen which is extremely cold.

Even though it may look like water, it can damage our skin severely

in a short period of time.

<P>

Before we experiment with liquid nitrogen and some very cold items,

let's see how we represent these temperatures.  Unfortunately,

extremely cold temperatures cannot be measured with a common thermometer


because it could easily freeze and even break! Instead, these

very cold temperatures are measured with electronic devices.

<P>

The gases in the air we breathe-oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide,

etc.  must be made very cold in order for them to change from gases

to liquids.  If only the Fahrenheit scale of temperature was available,

scientists would have to use large negative numbers to talk about

these temperatures.  They would use -460&#176;F.  to represent absolute

zero-the coldest temperature we can imagine.  Absolute zero is

the temperature where atoms lose all of their energy.

<P>

Instead of Fahrenheit, scientists use the Kelvin scale.  0&#176; Kelvin

is absolute zero and water freezes at 273&#176:K.  The room you are

sitting in may be about 300&#176;K.  The drawing on the following page

compares the three standard temperature scales-Fahrenheit, Celsius,

and Kelvin.

<P>

No one has ever been able to cool a material to absolute zero

to see what happens.  However, liquid nitrogen (77&#176;K.) and liquid

helium (4.2&#176;K.) have several common uses in medicine and science.

<P>

<B>About Liquid Nitrogen</B> 

<P>

You are going to be using liquid nitrogen in your study of cryogenics

and superconductivity.  Nitrogen makes up about 79% of the air

we breath.  If ordinary air is cooled to 77&#176; Kelvin, the nitrogen

will turn to a liquid.

<P>

Liquid nitrogen is used by hospitals, doctors, welding shops,

and many other industries.  It is even used to do minor surgery

on the skin.

<P>

It can be very dangerous if not handled properly.  Be sure you

understand all safety rules before using liquid nitrogen.

<P>

When you see liquid nitrogen, it is actually boiling the same

way water boils.  It just boils at a very cold temperature.  Just

like boiling water, it can quickly damage the skin.  However, it

freezes the skin instead of burning it.

<P>

Cryogenics is a branch of science that explores production and

effects of very cold materials.  We know that many plastics and

rubber will crack and break at very cold temperatures.  The first

few activities we will do are designed to help you see what happens

when common materials are cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature,

77&#176; K.

<B>**SAFETY**</B> 
<P>
<B>You are going to be using liquid nitrogen and handling some

very cold materials.  read and <u>understand</u> all safety procedures

carefully and get your teachers permission before beginning.</b>

<P>

<B>Procedure 1</B> 

<P>

<MENU>

1.  Carefully fill the Styrofoam cup with liquid nitrogen.<br>

2.  Place one of the rubber bands in the liquid nitrogen.  Notice

that the nitrogen will boil rapidly for a few seconds until the

rubber band has cooled completely.  When the rubber band is cold,

the rapid boiling will slow down.<br>

3.  Using the plastic tweezers, remove the rubber band and immediately

try to bend or stretch it.  If you allow the rubber band to warm

for more than a few seconds, the experiment will not work properly.<br>

4.  Insert a small flower in the liquid nitrogen and try squeezing

it when removed (be sure to use gloves).<br>

5.  Answer the questions on <B>Worksheet #1.</B> </MENU>

<P>

Many materials, including rubber and most plastics, become very

brittle when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature.  You can easily

break them while they are still cold.  You may want to try similar

experiments with other materials.  If you use a material that can

absorb the liquid nitrogen, handle it in such a way that the liquid

can drain onto a safe surface, not on you or your clothes.

<P>

<B>Procedure 2</B> 

<P>

<MENU>1.  This experiment works best in a flat container about 3"

by 5" and about an inch deep.  It can also be done in a Styrofoam

cup if performed carefully.<br>

2.  Inflate a common balloon until it is about 6"-8"

in diameter (smaller if using a cup).<br>

3.  Start by immersing one side of the balloon into the liquid.

The balloon should start to shrink.  Leave the balloon in the liquid

long enough that the balloon shrinks up completely.<br>

4.  Once the balloon has totally shrunk, remove it from the liquid

and lay it on the table.  As it warms, it should reinflate to normal

size.  Sometimes the balloon may crack, split or pop.<br>

5.  Try the same procedure with a helium filled balloon.<br>

6.  Answer the questions on <B>Worksheet #1.</B></MENU> 

<P>

<B>Procedure 3</B> 

<P>

<MENU>1.  Get a piece of solder and roll it into a coil about 2"

in diameter.  Test the coil to see how soft it is and tends to

stay any shape into which it is bent.<br>

2.  Carefully fill a Styrofoam cup with liquid nitrogen.<br>

3.  Bend one end of the solder up so that you have about 2"

to hold to.<br>

4.  Immerse the solder in the liquid and wait for the rapid boiling

of the liquid to slow down.<br>

5.  Remove the solder and quickly test it again.  It should act

like a spring and tend to return to its original shape when stretched

or compressed.<br>

on <B>Worksheet # 2.</B> 

<P>

<B>Procedure 2:</b>  Resistance Measurements

<P>

This procedure is to familiarize you with how to use an ohm meter

and what happens to some materials when they are cooled.

<P>

Materials needed:

<P>

<MENU>Volt-ohm meter (multimeter)<br>

Common carbon resistors (3 or 4)<br>

Bottom portion of regular Styrofoam cup<br>

Liquid nitrogen<br>

Safety glasses<br>

Coil of copper wire (choke)</MENU>

<P>

<MENU>

1.  Turn the volt-ohm meter on and set it to read ohms (ask your teacher 
if you need help).<br>

2.  Connect the probes to the correct terminals.<br>

3.  Connect one probe to one end of the carbon resistor.<br>

4.  Connect the other probe to the other end of the resistor.<br>

5.  Read the resistance and write it down (you may need assistance

if you have an analog, not digital, ohm meter).<br>

6.  Read the resistances of the other resistors in a similar manner

and write them down.<br>

7.  Read the resistance of the coil of wire in a similar manner and 
write it down.<br>

reading on <B>Worksheet #2.</B> <br>

13.  Measure and record the resistances for the carbon resistors

in the liquid nitrogen on <B>Worksheet #2.</B> </MENU>

<P>

<B>Procedure 3: </B>  Current flow in a wire (OPTIONAL)

<P>

This procedure demonstrates two things that happen when current

flows through a wire: (1) a magnetic field is created and (2)

resistance causes heat.  It's also valuable to understand that

if current flowing through a wire can produce heat, it can also

create a fire if a wire's capacity is exceeded.

<P>

Materials needed:

<P>

<MENU>2 C batteries and holder<br>

3 volt light bulb with holder<br>

Connecting wires<br>

Compass<br>

9-volt battery<br>

Tester that comes with some 9-volt batteries</MENU>

<P>

<MENU>1.  Connect the wires, battery, and light bulb so that the bulb

glows.<br>

2.  With the bulb glowing, slowly move the compass toward the wire.<br>

3.  Note what happens to the hand on the compass.<br>

4.  Disconnect one wire and lay the wire parallel and directly

parallel to the compass needle .<br>

5.  Connect and disconnect the wire and note what happens.<br>

6.  Try switching the connections on the battery and see what happens

to the compass needle.<br>

7.  Use the 9-volt tester to test the 9-volt battery and feel the

flat wires on the back of the tester.<br>

8.  Record the results on <B>Worksheet #2.</B> 

</MENU>

<P>

<B>Procedure 4:</B>  Levitation

<P>

The videotape and Procedure 3 demonstrated that current flowing

through a wire produces a magnetic field.  We are now going to

show that a superconducting material is capable of repelling a

magnetic field.  The reduced supercurrent in a superconductor creates

an internal magnetic field exactly opposite of the field of a

small magnet placed close to it.

<P>

You already know that if you place the North end of a magnet close

to the North end of another magnet, they will repel.  The same

thing happens in a superconducting material.  If the magnet is

placed on the superconductor, it will levitate above the material.

This phenomenon is being explored as a way to produce bearings

for motors that have almost no drag (resistance to moving).

<P>

Materials needed:

<P>

<MENU>Superconducting disk or ring<br>

Small neodymium-iron-boron (or other strong) magnet<br>

Liquid nitrogen<br>

Styrofoam cup bottom<br>

Non-magnetic tweezers</MENU>

<P>

<B>NOTE:</B> A disk or ring of superconducting material may be

used for this activity, either should work.

<P>

<MENU>1.  Place the superconducting disk in the bottom of the Styrofoam

cup.<br>

2.  Place a small, strong magnet on the disk.<br>

3.  Gently pour some liquid nitrogen around the disk or ring.<br>

4.  When the disk gets cold and begins to look wet, the magnet

should raise itself above the disk and stay there.<br>

5.  Try slipping a thin sheet of paper between the disk and the

magnet to see if the magnet is levitating.<br>

6.  If the magnet is strong enough and the disk is cooled to liquid

nitrogen, the magnet should levitate.<br>

7.  After the magnet begins to levitate, gently remove it from

above the disk with tweezers.<br>

8.  Allow the disk to return to room temperature.<br>

9.  Cool the disk without the magnet on it.<br>

10.  Place the magnet onto the superconducting disk and answer

the questions on <B>Worksheet #2.</B> 

</MENU>

<P>

<B>Procedure 5:  </B> Superconductor switch (OPTIONAL)

<P>

This procedure is designed to show how resistance is greatly reduced

when a coil of superconducting material is cooled to liquid nitrogen

temperature.

<P>

Materials needed:

<P>

<MENU>2 C batteries with holder<br>

3 volt light bulb with holder<br>

Superconducting coil with attached leads (see Appendix A for source)<br>


Wires to connect these together<br>

Liquid nitrogen<br>

Styrofoam cup</MENU>

<P>

<MENU>1.  Connect superconductor, light bulb, and battery.<br>

2.  When the superconductor is at room temperature, the resistance

should be high enough to prevent the bulb from lighting.<br>

3.  Fill the cup with about 1- 2 inches of liquid nitrogen.<br>

4.  Place the coil in the liquid nitrogen and observe that the

light bulb will glow brightly when the resistance drops in the

superconductor.<br>

5.  Remove the coil and the bulb should begin to dim as it warms

to room temperature.</MENU>

<P>

<B>NOTE:</B> This demonstration requires low-resistance contacts

on the superconducting coil.  If the switch fails to operate, it

may be due to poor contact between the coil and its leads.
