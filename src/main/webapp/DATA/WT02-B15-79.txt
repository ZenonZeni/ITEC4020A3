<H2>VIVOTIF BERNA&#174</H2>

<H3>(Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a)</H3>

<P>VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 is the first and only oral vaccine for typhoid
fever protection. According to experts in the field, it ranks
internationally amoung the most significant vaccine developments in
the last 25 years. To date, over 150 millions doses have been taken
worldwide.</P>

<P><B>History and Development Begun</B><BR>

in 1969, the development of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 by the Swiss Serum
and Vaccine Institute Berne (SS &amp; VIB) took 12 years. This unique
oral vaccine resulted from gene manipulation of the Ty21 strain of
<I>S. typhi.</I></P>

<P>The ability of<I> S. typhi</I> to cause disease and to induce a
protective immune response is dependent upon the bacteria possessing
a complete lipopolysaccharide. The <I>S. typhi</I> Ty21a vaccine
strain, by virtue of a reduction in enzymes essential for
lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, is restricted in its ability to
produce complete lipopolysaccharide. However, a sufficient quantity
of complete lipopolysaccharide is synthesized to evoke a protective
immune response.</P>

<P>The introduction of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 in the United States in
1990 was a joint effort between SS &amp; VIB and the US Military, who
helped to fund the field trials necessary for FDA approval. Following
it's approval, in 1991 the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board (eg. the
Defense Department's medical advisory panel) recommended that all
troops going overseas be given the oral vaccine.</P>

<P>Since its introduction, over 100 million doses of VIVOTIF
BERNA&#174 oral typhoid vaccine have been taken in the United
States.</P>

         - capsules should be taken on an empty stomach (ie,,1 hour
         before eating) to avoid delaying passage of capsule through
         stomach. Many patients find it's easiest to take at
         bedtime.<BR>
         
         - do not consume alcohol within 1 hour of swallowing the
         capsule, as the alcohol will break down the enteric coat.

         <P>Oral Ty21a is completely adsorbed in the ileum, with no
         excretion in the feces. Therefore there is no risk of
         contaminating other family members. It stimulates local
         immunity in the gut at the site of potenial typhoid
         infection
