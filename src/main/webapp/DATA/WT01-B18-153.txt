<H2><I>A. </I>Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Reduce the Threat of 
Global Climate Change While Fueling Economic Growth<BR></H2>

<BR>
Energy-related carbon emissions in the United States have reached an 
all-time high. Emissions resulting from the nation's use of fossil fuels 
climbed to 1,394 million metric tons in 1994, an increase of 24 million 
metric tons (1.8 percent) over 1993 levels, and of 56 million metric tons 
(4.2 percent) compared with 1990 levels.<a href="#3" name="r3"> [ 3 ] </a>But this growth in carbon 
emissions can be reversed. A national energy strategy that emphasizes 
energy efficiency and renewable energy could remedy the threat posed by 
global climate change.<BR>

<h3><I>Chart 1: Carbon Emission Trends</I></h3><br clear=all><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>     Numerous studies have examined the impact of a national energy 
strategy that emphasizes greater energy efficiency. <I>America's Energy 
Choices</I>,<a href="#4" name="r4"> [ 4 ] </a>for example, showed that vigorous adoption of cost-effective 
energy efficiency and renewable energy measures could cut national energy 
usage in 2030 by nearly 50 percent.<B> </B>Those same measures could 
dramatically reduce our nation's petroleum dependence, save consumers more 
than $2 trillion net over the next 40 years, and cut carbon dioxide 
emissions in 2030 by more than 70 percent (relative to emissions in 
1988).<a href="#5" name="r5"> [ 5 ] </a>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimates that 23 
percent of all U.S. electricity consumption could be saved for less than 3 
cents per kilowatt-hour - which is less than the cost of generating 
that electricity.<a href="#6" name="r6"> [ 6 ] </a>

<p>     Investments in energy efficiency offer significant environmental 
improvements <I>and</I> economic gains. If the U.S. was to adopt the 
program laid out in <I>America's Energy Choices</I>, by the year 2010 
America could:<BR><ul>
 <LI>     Reduce annual electricity generation by 27 percent;<BR>
 <LI>     Decrease the need for new generating facilities by more than 50 
percent;<BR>
 <LI>     Reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in the utility sector by 33 
percent and nitrogen oxides by 12 percent;<BR>
 <LI>     Reduce the total amount paid for electricity by 18 percent (a 
savings of $50 billion in 1992 dollars); and<BR>
 <LI>     Increase annual consumption of goods and services other than 
electricity by $45 billion.<BR>
</ul>
All this could be accomplished without a loss of jobs or increased 
inflation, and with a cumulative savings of $211 billion off the nation's 
electric bill. Union of Concerned Scientists, et al., <I>America's Energy

<P><A NAME="6"  HREF="#r6">6.</a> Other studies have also shown that the U.S. materials economy is only 
about 10 to 15 percent efficient - or even lower. Robert U. Ayres 
estimates that roughly 94 percent of the materials used in the U.S. 
manufacturing sector are converted to waste. This implies a net efficiency 
of only 6 percent. The vast volume of resource waste means a large 
environmental impact. It also means a higher cost of goods and services.
