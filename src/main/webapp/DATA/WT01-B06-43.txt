Basic Investment Principles of Risk and Return</H2></P>


<HR>

When building an investment portfolio, you need to start with an investment foundation. Boiled down to its bare basics, investing concerns returns and risks.<P>

An investor's return consists of current income, plus capital gains due to growth, minus any losses from the investment. Sounds simple, and it is, except that most investors would prefer to know the return before making the investment.<P>


Absent a crystal ball, you can only make an educated guess as to what kind of return to expect. If your actual return turns out to be different than the return you expected, you could suffer an unexpected loss.<P>


Of course, your expected return must be reasonable--expecting a return of 25% just because your stockbroker says that's what you'll earn is not reasonable. But even if your expectations are reasonable, there's always the possibility that your investment's actual return will be different than expected. This is the risk you must take on as an investor, and it includes the possibility of losing some or all of your original investment. The greater the uncertainty, the greater the risk.<P>


What is uncertainty? The future is uncertain, and the longer you must wait for your return--or, the longer the time period over which you must make your educated guess as to return--the greater the uncertainty. In addition, the quality and stability of the investment is uncertain. <P>


There are several major sources of uncertainty, or risk, that could produce unexpected returns. They include:<P>


<UL><LI>Business and industry risk: The uncertainty of an investment's ability to pay income, principal, and any other returns due to a significant fall-off in business (either firm-related or industry-wide) or bankruptcy.<P>


<LI>Inflation risk: The uncertainty over future inflation rates, which results in uncertainty over the future real (after-inflation) value of your investment. An investment that barely keeps pace with inflation will not be able to grow in real terms, leaving only as much purchasing power in the future as you have today. <P>


<LI>Market risk: The risk that the general market or economic environment will cause the investment to lose value regardless of the particular security. A stock may drop in value simply because the overall stock market has fallen; this is referred to as stock market risk. A bond doesn't face stock market risk, but it may drop in value due to a rise in interest rates; this is referred to as interest rate risk.<P>

<LI>Liquidity risk: The risk of not being able to get out of the investment conveniently at a reasonable price. This can occur for a number of reasons. If the market is volatile, you may be forced to sell at a significant loss if you must sell immediately. Another cause can be an inactive market. For instance, it may be difficult to sell a house simply because there are no buyers.<P></UL>


All investments face each of these risks, but the degree of risk varies greatly. For instance, stocks face much less inflation risk than bonds. On the other hand, short-term bonds and money market investments face little liquidity risk, while stocks face a greater liquidity risk, since you may be forced to sell at an inopportune time, suffering a large loss.<P>


Ironically, it is uncertainty that creates the potential for higher returns. How? Because of the risk/return trade-off.<P>


Every investor wants the highest assured return possible. But as we have seen, returns aren't certain, and different investors have varying degrees of uncertainty that they are willing to accept. In fact, each investor seeks the highest possible return at the level of uncertainty, or risk, that he is willing to accept.
<P>

In a competitive marketplace, this results in a trade-off: Low levels of uncertainty (low risk) are the most desirable, and are therefore associated with low potential returns. High levels of uncertainty (high risk) are the most undesirable, and are therefore associated with high potential returns.<P>


Over the last 50 years, stocks have produced returns that average 13% annually; long-term bonds have averaged 5% annually and short-term Treasury bills have averaged 4.5% annually. These returns reflect the risk/return trade-off. The trade-off, however, exists on average, not in every single instance: Remember, it's the uncertainty that's the risk. As an investor, you must analyze each investment, comparing the potential returns with the risks. The trade-off also serves as a warning flag--high potential returns usually flag high risks, even when those risks are not obvious at first glance.<P>


While potential returns should compensate you for risk, there are some risks that you will not be compensated for, and therefore they should be avoided.<P>


If you invest in a single security, your return will depend solely on that security; if that security flops, your entire return will be severely affected. Clearly, held by itself, the single security is highly risky.<P>


If you add nine other unrelated securities to that single security portfolio, the possible outcome changes--if that security flops, your entire return won't be as badly hurt. By diversifying your investments, you have substantially reduced the risk of the single security. However, that security's return will be the same whether held in isolation or in a portfolio.<P>


Diversification substantially reduces your risk with little impact on potential returns. The key involves investing in categories or securities that are dissimilar: Their returns are affected by different factors and they face different kinds of risks.<P>


Diversification should occur at all levels of investing. Diversification among the major asset categories--stocks, fixed-income and money market investments--can help reduce market risk, inflation risk and liquidity risk, since these categories are affected by different market and economic factors.<P>


Diversification within the major asset categories--for instance, among the various kinds of stocks (international or domestic, for instance) or fixed-income products--can help further reduce market and inflation risk.<P>


And as shown in the 10-security portfolio, diversification among individual securities helps reduce business risk.<P>


There is one other type of diversification that is extremely important yet often overlooked--time diversification, remaining invested over different market cycles.<P>


Time diversification helps reduce the risk that you may enter or leave a particular investment or category at a bad time in the economic cycle. It has much more of an impact on investments that have a high degree of volatility, such as stocks, where prices can fluctuate over the short term. Longer time periods smooth those fluctuations. Conversely, if you cannot remain invested in a volatile investment over relatively long time periods, those investments should be avoided. Time diversification is less important for relatively stable investments, such as certificates of deposit, money market funds and short-term bonds.<P>


Time diversification also comes into play when investing or withdrawing large sums of money. In general, it is better to do so gradually over time, rather than all at once, to reduce risk.<P>


In building your investment portfolio, you are simply seeking answers to these questions:<P>


<UL><LI> What are the risks?


<LI> What risks can be eliminated or reduced through diversification and which risks will remain?


<LI> What are the returns associated with the risks I will be undertaking?</UL><P>


The answer to the last question is a balance of those risks and potential returns, based on your own personal circumstances and your tolerance for risk.<P>
