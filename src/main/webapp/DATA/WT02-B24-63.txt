<h2>Related Services:<br>
Assisting a Child with a Disability to Benefit from Special 
Education</h2>

<p>Margaret Carr<br>
Advocacy Committee 

<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires 
school districts to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) 
to all students who qualify for special education under the Act. FAPE 
includes "special education and related services" that are provided at 
public expense and at no charge in conformity with the student's 
individualized education plan (IEP) 20 USC §1401(a)(18). The U.S. 
Supreme Court in <b>Irving ISD v. Tatro</b> clarified that related 
services include everything needed by the student with disabilities to 
"reach, enter, exit or remain in school during the day."

<p>The need for related services should be addressed during the meeting 
at which the IEP is developed for a student with disabilities. The IEP 
must contain every related service the school district is to provide. It 
should also include the frequency and duration of the service as well as 
the title of the individual providing the service.

<p>Related services, provided under 20 USC §1401(17) include, but are 
not limited to:
<ul>
<li>transportation
<li>speech pathology and audiology
<li>psychological services
<li>physical and occupational therapy
<li>recreation, including therapeutic recreation
<li>early identification and assessment of disabilities in children 
<li>counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling
<li>medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes
<li>school health services
<li>social work services
<li>parent counseling and training
</ul>

<p>Related services may include developmental, corrective or supportive 
services which are necessary to assist a child with a disability benefit 
from special education (34 CFR §300.16 (Comment)). Assistive technology 
devices/services may also qualify as related services (<CITE>Letter to 
Goodman</CITE>, 16 IDELR 1317 (OSEP 1990)).
