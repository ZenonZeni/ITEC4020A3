Global</b> are about to announce a new mutual fund class based upon G.T. Global's belief that investment potential exists in telecommunications, technology, healthcare, natural resources, financial services infrastructure and consumer products and services worldwide. There, that about covers everything! This looks like an encompassing hunt for international growth markets. The information was skimpy in this initial press release. Advisor roadshows started on September 30th. G.T. Global claim that this fund will be the first of its kind in Canada. If you like international growth and it certainly has possibilities over the next few months, ask your advisor to get you some information.<p><b>C.I. Fund</b> has recently hired fund whiz Jonathan Baird to run two new Canadian mutual funds. Mr. Baird, who left <b>Dynamic Funds</b> about one year ago, has done a really good job of generating results for<b> University Avenue Funds</b>. As an independent manager, he will be retained by both <b>University Avenue</b> and <b>C.I</b>. Baird, in my opinion, is one of the few "Star" managers who have recently moved to new funds and have lived up to their reputations as hot fund managers.<p><b>University Avenue Funds</b>, long an advocate of direct, no-load selling, have decided to offer their funds through investment advisors. Advisors may charge up to three percent sales charge, with no deferred load option available. Advisors will receive a trailer fee of one percent per year. Most of <b>University Avenue's</b> thirty-five million dollar assets are in the <b>University Avenue Canadian Fund</b>, managed by Jonathan Baird.<p><b>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</b>, who have been one of the poorer performers out of the bank mutual fund groups, are working to put some zip into their fund performance by utilizing three <b>Talvest</b> investment managers to run <b>CIBC funds</b>. The three managers will run CIBC's $280 million <b>Capital Appreciation Fund</b>. The fund invests in small to mid cap Canadian stocks. Paul Wong will pick resource stocks, Stephen Kahn will pick overseas stocks and Paul Barnard will pick small industrial and technology stocks.<p>CIBC will climb on the Demographics bandwagon by offering the <b>CIBC North American Demographics Fund</b>, which will be managed by Ken Woods of <b>Talvest.</b> <b>Talvest Investment Counsel</b> is a subsidiary of <b>CIBC.<p></b>Personal trading by mutual fund managers has become a hot topic in recent weeks. Following US scandals, the Canadian fund industry seems to be heading towards tougher rules to govern manager trading. <b>Altamira,</b> strung by accusations that star manager Frank Mersch may have violated ethics by tipping a friend to buy <b>Diamond Fields</b> in the early stages of its rocket like-growth, have stipulated that Altamira managers and families may only buy Altamira funds for personal investment purposes. Other firms follow the Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR) which has tough rules against personal trading and other conflict of interest issues. A few fund firms still have no policy regarding staff investment practices.<p>Canadian fund managers are by no means alone when it comes to fund manager scandals. Two prominent international fund management  companies, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management of England and Jardine Fleming of Hong Kong have both suffered at the hands of rogue "star" managers. Morgan Grenfell manager Peter Young covered up losses to the tune of about $400 million, while Jardine Fleming's Colin Armstrong diverted profitable trades to his own account, costing Jardine Fleming about $20 million in fines and penalties. Also, the proud international reputations of both firms have been damaged in the process. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>
