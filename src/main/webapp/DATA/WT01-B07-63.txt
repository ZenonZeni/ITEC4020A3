<H1>Heat Pumps for Ventilation Exhaust Air Heat Recovery</H1>

<H2><A NAME="beginning"></A>An Annotated Bibliography from the
AIVC</H2>

<H3>by Mark Limb, Air Infiltration Ventilation Centre</H3>

<P>
The AIVC's series of annotated bibliographies aims to review and
technically assess current literature and provide a concise but
in depth overview of particular subjects. The latest addition
to this series summarises research into the use and application
of heat pumps in ventilation heat recovery systems. It is aimed
at design professionals, researchers and engineers who have an
interest in heat pumps in ventilation systems.
<P>
The document is divided into six main sections.

Heat pumps are defined in the introduction by ASHRAE as devices
that extract heat from one substance and transfer it to another
portion of the same substance or to a second substance at a higher
temperature. In the case of heat pump heat recovery from ventilation
air, heat is extracted from a source, usually waste heat in the
extract air, and transferred to a suitable source, usually the
domestic hot water system or alternatively space heating system
of the ventilation supply air. In section two of this document,
the distinction is made between the two main types of heat pumps,
i.e., vapour compression and absorption heat pumps, and a brief
explanation of their relevant operational cycle is given. Section
two also defines the Coefficient of Performance and contains a
brief note on the use of relevant working fluids and the Montreal
Protocol.

The main body of this bibliography outlines those papers that
describe the use and installation of heat pumps in real buildings.
Section three concentrates on residential examples and section
four focuses on other buildings such as swimming pools and commercial
establishments. The most common configuration in all buildings
is an air-to-water type system, with the heat pump located in
the exhaust duct transferring waste heat to the hot water circuit.
Air-to-air heat pumps are also popular, where heat is transferred
to the supply air as a form of preheat. Novel configurations such
as &quot;Dynamic Insulation&quot; incorporating heat pumps have
also been included in this bibliography as well as the use of
heat pumps in swimming pools, schools, shops and offices.
<P>
In conclusion the studies outlined demonstrate that for typical
residential air-water heat pumps COP's of between 2 and 3.5 are
possible, and in extremely favourable cases they can be as high
as 5. While for residential air-to-air heat pumps COP's of between
2 to 5 were reported. Where combined heat pumps and heat exchangers
are utilised COP's can reach slightly over 5. For commercial buildings,
typical COP's range from 2 to 3, while for swimming pools examples
have quoted around 1.7. These examples demonstrate the potential
for heat pump technology to further enhance the energy efficiency
of our buildings.
