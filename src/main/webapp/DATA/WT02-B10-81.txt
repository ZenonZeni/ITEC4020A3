<H3>SUCCESS</H3>

We put ourselves on the line! Dawnbreaker measures its success by the success of our clients in obtaining private sector funding directly related to the tools and skills developed in our programs.<P>
The result:  Fifty percent of the companies we have assisted during the last four programs received private sector investments within 18 months. The cumulative value of these contracts is in excess of $52 million. Increased sales during the 18-month period following program completion exceeded $30 million. While other sources collect long-term follow up data, we measure only near-term financial impact (18 months) that can be directly traced back to the effective use of the business plans developed via this program and the principals' increased business acumen resulting from Dawnbreaker's mentoring process.  This near-term focus increases the likelihood that participating companies will successfully cross the "valley of death," and attain their commercialization objectives.<P>

A sample of client success stories are highlighted under each program heading. General descriptions of the three programs also follow.<P>

If you are interested in seeing the types of opportunities which have been showcased in previous CAP programs, please preview the following. For further information on any of these companies, please contact the company directly using the contact information listed at the end of each success story.

<H4><A NAME="CAP">Commercialization Assistance Program</A></H4><P>

This program is designed for groups of up to 100 companies and is typically sponsored by an organization, such as a federal agency, with a vested interest in the success of the companies. The purpose of the CAP is to speed up the rate of successful commercialization of R&D. This is accomplished via a process which contains the following components: (1) comprehensive business research and strategic planning, (2) development of a business plan, a stand-alone executive summary, and presentation materials, (3) targeted outreach to potential strategic allies and investors, and (4) a Commercialization Opportunity Forum which brings together well-prepared technology entrepreneurs with prequalified investors and teaming partners.<P>

The success of this program is measured by the success of our clients. Specifically, we look at <P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>how many finalists receive private sector financing within 18 months of the Forum,
<LI>the dollar value of those signed agreements, 
<LI>the dollar value of increased sales, 
<LI>and the increase in the number of jobs.
</UL>
The program is designed for use with geographically dispersed or remote clients and consists of guided mentoring, the use of local resources, and three events spaced over a 6-9 month period.<P>

<H4><A NAME="Strategic Plan">Strategic Planning Program</A></H4><P>

The Strategic Planning Program was conducted in 1995 as a pilot for companies which had received awards from the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). Success for this program is measured by:<P>

<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Private sector investment
<LI>Increased sales
</UL>
<H4><A NAME="Indicators">Indicators of Commercial Potential</A></H4><P>

This program is an outgrowth of a pilot program that Dawnbreaker conducted for the Department of Defense in 1994 and 1995. The program is designed for use with Phase I SBIR and STTR recipients. The objective is to increase the likelihood that companies will receive Phase II financing by appropriately addressing preliminary commercialization issues in their Phase II proposals.<P>

Success is measured by:<P>

<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Receipt of Phase II award
<LI>Headway with private sector commercialization
</UL>
