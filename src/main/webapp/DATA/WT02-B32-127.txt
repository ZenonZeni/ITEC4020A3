<font size=+2>The Best And Worst Time To Invest</font>

</center>

<blockquote>

<font size=+2><b>W</b></font>hen is the right time to invest?  The markets are 
overheated right now, should I wait?  Bonds are low but will they come back to
give us good returns?<p>

As financial advisors we are asked these questions every day -- especially at
this present time because mutual funds, in particular the equity funds, have
had a good performing year to date.  The answer is that the best time to invest
is whenever one has the money.  In the long term it matters very little whether
you try to time the market or not.  Sound diversification of funds and the length 
of time invested for compounding are the keys to successful investing.<p>

Templeton International has actually proven the point by conducting the following
 analysis:  they compared the performance if you invested $5,000 for a year for each of the
  past 25 years on the day the Dow Jones was at the highest point versus 
  investing $5,000 a year when the Dow Jones was at the lowest point.  The 
  results are quite astounding:  if you guessed correctly (which one never could), 
  by investing at the market low every single year, the annual compound rate 
  of return would be 17.8%.  However, if you were always wrong and picked the 
  highest point each year (also unlikely) you would have yielded an annual compound 
  rate of return of 17.1%.<p>

  You might argue:  that was then, what about now?  There are so many problems 
  in the world currently, however if you review the last 25 years there have always 
  been problems, double digit interest rates, very low interest rates, the 
  Gulf War, the collapse of the Berlin wall, the market crash of 1987, the fall 
  of the Mexican peso, the list is endless.  On the contrary, there are major 
  areas of growth emerging, particularly in the Far East and Latin America.  For 
  example, the telecommunications area is one rapidly moving sector of the world 
  economy.  We are in fact in an exciting time to invest.<p>

  Of course, the other option takes the guesswork out of when the best time 
  to invest is by using the dollar cost averaging approach to your investment 
  strategy.  By systematically investing per month through a pre-authorized 
  chequing plan your money is buying shares each month -- sometimes you will 
  be buying when the market is low so you will accumulate more shares.  The 
  other advantage of a systematic savings plan is that it is easier on the 
  pocket book.  Instead of having to find a lump sum to deposit, you can structure 
  the budget for a monthly contribution.  After a couple of months your investment becomes 
  just another payment.  The pre-authorized plan is a sound strategy for RRSP 
  contributions.<p>

  if you would like more information on the mechanics of starting a pre-authorized 
  investment play, please call the Money Concepts office.<p>
