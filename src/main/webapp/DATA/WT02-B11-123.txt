The Sixth Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy will take<br>
place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on March 27-30,<br>
1996.  CFP96 is hosted by MIT and by the World Wide Web Consortium.<br>
<p>
Since its inception in 1991, the series of CFP conferences has brought<br>
together experts and advocates from the fields of computer science,<br>
law, business, public policy, law enforcement, government, and many<br>
other areas to explore how computer and telecommunications<br>
technologies are affecting freedom and privacy.<br>
<p>
Registration for CFP96 will open on December 8.  <br>
<p>
Conference attendance will be limited.  Due to the enormous public<br>
interest in CFP issues over the past year, we encourage you to<br>
register early.<br>
<p>
SPECIAL NOTE TO STUDENTS: There are a limited number of places<br>
available at a special student rate.  These will be allotted on a<br>
first-come first-served basis, so register as soon as possible.<br>
<p>
Events planned for this year's conference include:<br>
<p>
    - Federal prosecutors square off against civil-liberties lawyers<br>
      in a mock Supreme Court test of the "Cryptography Control Act of<br>
      1996", which criminalizes non-escrowed encryption.<br>
      <br>
    - Authors Pat Cadigan, Tom Maddox, Bruce Sterling,<br>
      and Vernor Vinge divine the future of privacy.<br>
<p>
    - College administrators, students, lawyers, and journalists<br>
      role-play scenarios that plumb the limits of on-line expression<br>
      on campus networks.<br>
<p>
    - Panels on international issues in privacy and encryption; on the<br>
      struggle to control controversial content on the Internet; on<br>
      tensions between copyright of digital information and freedom of<br>
      expression; on threats posed by electronic money to law<br>
      enforcement, privacy, and freedom; on mass communication versus<br>
      mass media.<br>
<p>
You can register for CFP96, starting December 8, by US Mail, by fax,<br>
or via the World Wide Web.<br>
