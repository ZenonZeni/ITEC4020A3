<H3>From the MSN Member Guidelines:</H3>
<H3>MSN Forums</H3>
Our forums consist of bulletin boards, chat rooms and conferences, and file
libraries. Forums are the place to share your views and interests with large
groups of members. There is a wide array of subjects available, reflecting
members' diverse interests. We encourage the exchange of viewpoints and
information, which is vital to making MSN lively and interesting.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Forum Manager<BR>
</STRONG>The activities in each forum are guided by a forum manager. The
forum manager sets the tone for the forum and might establish guidelines
that are unique to a particular forum. The forum manager might also schedule
conferences, manage the file library, and organize and respond to bulletin
board messages. From time to time, the forum manager will check files and
messages to ensure that they are in keeping with the forum topic and MSN
policies. Forum managers also respond to inquiries from members interested
in the forum.<BR>
Note: If you want to apply to MSN to become a forum manager or provide other
services to members, look in the InfoCenter of the category you are interested
in for the name of the person to contact.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Bulletin Boards (BBS) and File Libraries</STRONG><BR>
Bulletin board messages are public notices that the entire online community
can view. They are the platform for ideas and opinions, discussion and debate,
with information for everyone to share. Bulletin board messages are displayed
for a period of time set by the forum manager.<BR>
<BR>
Some MSN bulletin boards serve as large libraries of files that you can
download. These files are available as attachments to bulletin board messages.
Certain files might be offered to members as shareware. In some areas, there
is a charge for downloading a file. Please be sure to check whether there
are separate charges associated with a particular file. Look up File Libraries
in the MSN Help Index to learn how to view, read about, and download files.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Chat Rooms</STRONG><BR>
Forum chat rooms offer participation in live, real-time conversations related
to the forum topic. A forum might have several chat rooms active at one
time. Chat is not moderated, but either a forum manager or an experienced
member will move in and out of chat rooms to keep the conversations on topic
and free of disruptions.<BR>
<BR>
MSN forums feature special scheduled chat events open to all members. These
special events are arranged and moderated by a host, usually the forum manager.
Special chat events let MSN members meet prominent figures from public life,
the arts, sciences, popular culture, and, of course, computing.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A Note About Adult Content</STRONG><BR>
Certain areas of MSN offer content for members who are at least 18 years
of age. Such content might appear in forums and will also be available over
adult Usenet newsgroups. Usenet is a public network that is not part of
MSN. It consists of several thousand online groups that discuss and debate
topics with varying degrees of focus.<BR>
<BR>
When you first join MSN, you will not have access to adult content. To request
access to adult content that is part of MSN or from Usenet newsgroups:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) Double-click the service you would like to open.<BR>
2) Follow the directions and complete the e-form requesting access.</BLOCKQUOTE>
