<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>"The Virginia South Team is developing a low cost advanced technology inverter for on road and off
road vehicles, exploring the advantages of soft switching, and leveraging the advantages of single
CMOS chip motor/vector microcontroller and integrated IGBT/gate control modules"</P>
<P>
Virginia South Team Members ­ Primary Responsibilities </P>

<P><UL>
<LI> GE ­ Inverter design, traction drive integration, and test Analog Devices ­ IC chip microcontroller design
<LI> IXYS ­ "Smart" IGBT module design
<LI> VPEC ­ Inverter soft switching topology/PWM algorithm selection, and inverter test </UL></P>

<P><B>Inverter General Description</B></P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Control platform suitable for multiple applications 
<LI>     On road vehicle traction drive 300 VDC battery supply 
<LI>     Off road vehicle traction drive 72 VDC battery supply 
<LI>     Liquid, convection, or conduction cooling options 
<LI>     50% reduction in cost and size 
<LI>     Reduction in switching losses/reduced capacitor bank 
<LI>     Single mother/daughter PWB, single IC chip microcontroller 
<LI>     "Smart" IGBT modules integrating gating and protection circuits 
<LI>     Minimum use of connectors 
<LI>     Optimized heat sink design
<LI>     Smooth torque control
<LI>     Smooth torque through low speed range
<LI>     Smooth transition motoring to regeneration
<LI>     Reduced switching and conduction losses
<LI>     Space vector modulation to reduce switching losses 
<LI>     Soft switching option to further reduce switching losses (where cost effective) 
<LI>     IGBTs selected to minimize conduction losses and thermal impedance </UL></P>

<P><B>Control Description</B></P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Single mother/daughter PWB
<LI>     Single IC chip microcontroller (ADMC300) containing: 
<P><UL>
<LI>          A/D converters 
<LI>          PWM control 
<LI>          Tach interface 
<LI>          Drive differentiation through software</UL></P></UL></P>

<P><B>Power Device Description</B></P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Dual 300 A/600 V IGBT modules (initial product) 
<LI>     Integrated gate driver and protection circuits 
<LI>     Reduced thermal losses and thermal impedance</UL></P>

<P><B>Benefit: </B></P><P>Cost is a primary determinant in design decisions for traction drive inverters, since the AC
traction drive must be cost competitive with internal combustion and DC electric traction drives The
design goal of this program is to develop inverters for on road vehicle (320 VDC battery system) which
can be marketed for less than $2500. The ultimate benefit from this RA94 program is the development
of improved new technology reduced cost and size inverters to promote growth of the electric vehicle
industry </P>
