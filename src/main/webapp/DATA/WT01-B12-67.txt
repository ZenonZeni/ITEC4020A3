 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ESPECIALLY FOR MEN </H2>

<P>  INNER MAGIC M is the male counterpart to INNER MAGIC E It is the most popular product of its kind on the market.</P>
 <P> While it is common knowledge that women are troubled with hormone imbalances, the same is true with men. We live in a world full of stress. Most men's work days are loaded with stressful situations.  They are usually required to travel more, eat on the run, start early and stop late. Good nutrition often takes a back seat. These factors set them up for trouble. The male gonadal system is designed to help men handle these kinds of situations.   INNER MAGIC M is the ideal way to supplement with herbs known to be nutritionally supportive of the male endocrine system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT INNER MAGIC M DOES</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC M contains a unique blend of special herbs to nutritionally support the proper metabolic activities of the primary glands of the male endocrine system: the adrenals, the pituitary and the testicles. Supporting the pituitary seems to help fight stress. The testicles produce testosterone, which is the hormone primarily responsible for the maintenance of the physical male sex characteristics. Testosterone works in men like estrogen works in women. If the production of testosterone decreases, sex drive is diminished and infertility can even result.   It is also an important hormone in the conversion of fat to muscle tissue and seems to be associated with the more aggressive nature of most men. Low levels of testosterone in middle aged men have been shown to be at least partially responsible for lack of libido and general malaise.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMBALANCES</H2>
<P>  Symptoms of male hormone imbalance are many and quite often overlooked.  They include decreased sperm production,  diminished  sexual  desire,  impotency, nervousness, anxiety, mood changes, headache and loss of lean muscle mass.</P>
<P>   The male prostate gland is also important to fertility. It manufactures most of the fluids, buffers and enzymes in  semen.   By  age  50,  men  have  a 20%  risk of developing an enlarged, or inflamed prostate and by the age of  60 the chances are better than 50%. The prostate gland lies around the part of the urethra where it is attached to the bladder.</P>
 <P> When male hormone levels decrease with age, minute tissue changes occur similar to some of the changes in women during menopause. The prostate usually enlarges and becomes more firm. It pushes against the bladder and restricts the urethra. Men with this problem usually have to urinate frequently and then only with difficulty. Because of restricted flow, the urine also becomes concentrated in the bladder, and irritation and infection can result.</P>
<P>  The Life Plus INNER MAGIC M formula, as its name suggests, is formulated for special nutritional support for men.  Its unique formulation contains twelve special herbs chosen for their special synergistic nutritional effects.   They include Norwegian Kelp, Siberian Ginseng, Myrrh, Fennel, Parsley, Sarsaparilla (Smilax). Saw Palmetto Extract, Yohimbe PE, Juniper Berries, Gravel Root, Cayenne and Chlorophyll.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE INNER MAGIC M</H2>
