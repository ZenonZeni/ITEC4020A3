A New Spin On Quality Circles</H1>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
Usually quality circles--if they're used at all anymore--are found on the factory floor. 
<P>But at Honda, they are everywhere--even in R&amp;D. Here's a look at how they work.

<P>If you walked through the large room where design engineers were working at CAD terminals running CATIA at Honda R&amp;D North America's Raymond, Ohio, complex a few years ago, you would have seen people who were apparently busily at worktapping on keyboards, dragging mice, turning dials, using styliunless the system had crashed. Or perhaps you'd see them standing at plotters. Sometimes they were getting what they expected to come rolling out. Other times they were frustrated because: (a) nothing came out; (b) only part of what was supposed to be there came out; (c) the output took an extraordinarily long time.

<P>There was also a problem related to the model, or file, that could be handled at the time. It was 640K, or about 
the size a floppy disc can handle. Which meant that complex designs, which take up a lot of disc space, were difficult 
to organize due to the size limitation.

<P>And there were times when, as more people logged onto the system to do their jobs, response times of the 
mainframe-based network s-l-o-w-e-d. It took seemingly forever to get simple things done. And when you are trying to do extraordinary things, time stands still.

<P>However, given all of this, the people seemed to be hard at it, plugging away at the CAD system. But at times, 
these people were pretty frustrated due to the plotters, the file size limitation, and the slow system response. To say nothing of the crashes. What's more, there was a waste associated with the activity--or inactivity--because what could be accomplished was being inhibited by the system performance.

<P>According to Laura Minor, senior design engineer at the facility, who came to Honda from Boeing, where fast 
CAD systems are certainly a way of life for design engineers, one of the problems at Honda R&amp;D was that although about 80% of the engineers' time was being spent working at CAD terminals, there wasn't a full appreciation among some of those in upper-level management of how frustrating slow response time or any of the other difficulties are because those managers tended to have backgrounds that included experience on drawing boards, not workstations. A fundamental reason, of course, for the general invisibility of the problem was that the people were visibly hard at it. They <I>seemed</I> to be working just fine. But unlike an assembly line, where it is clear how things are moving along in real time, the design activity is such that what is (or isn't) happening is not particularly evident to the observer. It was hidden waste, 
perhaps the most costly type of all.

<P>So instead of simply complaining (i.e., &quot;This system is too slow and inefficient!&quot;), Minor and seven other colleagues did what Honda people tend to do, which is to operate in a pragmatic manner. An NHor &quot;New Honda&quot;circle was established, with the concurrence of management, consisting of eight participants. In addition to Minor, there were two white body design engineers, two interior design engineers, two people from the information systems function, and a person from the technical training area.

<P>The NH circle is something used throughout Honda. It is, perhaps, familiar to many people as a &quot;quality 
circle.&quot; However, whereas quality circles in many organizations became disappearing spirals largely due to lack of on-going focus, consistency and application, Honda people have made NH circles part of their on-going routine. At Honda, says Charlie Baker, division director, Automobile Design Engineering, Honda R&amp;D North America, one of the tenants of company founder Soichiro Honda was &quot;Strive constantly for a harmonious flow of work,&quot; which lead to the entire company--in manufacturing, engineering and elsewhere--to embrace total quality management (TQM). Central to the TQM approach is the &quot;Deming Circle,&quot; which is based on the four steps: Plan, Do, Check, Action. Although the tendency in many manufacturing companies was to organize quality circles almost exclusively on the shop floor, at Honda there are no such limits.

<P>&quot;The approach we took,&quot; Minor recalls of the CAD NH circle, &quot;was to make a root cause determination and to make sure that we weren't overlooking anything.&quot; They came up with &quot;four basic hot spots&quot;: the response time, the limited model size, the plotting system, and the system crashes. Then, to make sure that these were indeed the problems, they surveyed all of the engineers. Once they were in agreement, they proceeded to determine just how big the problem really was.

<P>For example, they created a program based on what a designer would do in developing a roof (from creating the 
model all the way through generating the drawing). Then they got volunteers who memorized the program. They then ran a series of tests to see how long it took these designers to do the program. To check the system response, they set it up so that one person came in at 6:30 a.m., a half-hour before the normal starting time, to run it alone on the system. Then they did it with 18 people, then 40 people running the program at the same time. Time and user satisfaction were measured. The efficiency losses based on number of users were calculated and translated into dollars. In 1994, the annual loss from inefficiency was on the order of $700,000. Had no changes not been made, the loss today would be on the order of $3-million per year (given the larger staff presently at work). Other factors, such as the model size used at competitive automakers including Chrysler and Saturn, were measured and used as part of the report on the overall productivity loss.

<P>The solution to the problem was determined to be a switch to workstation-based CAD. Although it required an investment in new equipment, the results of the NH circle proved to management that there would be a payback.

<P>The bottom line: Quality circles are viable when used consistently. And just as important, they shouldn't be limited to factory-floor problems. The paybacks in engineering can be significant.

<P><B><I>Zero-Base Plan Saves Big Money</B><BR>
The Honda of America Manufacturing engine plant in Anna, Ohio, is, with the ongoing $200-million expansion, the single largest source of Honda auto engines in the world. By 1998, the plant will be producing 3,700 units per day.

<P>The 190,000-sq. ft. expansion--which includes all aspects of engine manufacturing: casting, machining, assembly--was done largely to accommodate the new 3.0-L V6 engine that went into production in September for the Acura 3.0 CL coupe. This engine, which is exclusively built at the Anna Engine Plant, features all-aluminum construction; it is the lightest engine in its class (compared with the Lexus ES 300 and Infiniti I30 engines). But the plant is based on flexibility as well as efficiency: L4 engines and V6 engines can be produced on the same lines.

<P>One technique that was used by the Honda engineers in determining how to facilitize the plant in terms of 
the amount of equipment on the floor was to use what is called the &quot;zero-base plan.&quot; AEP plant manager Larry Jutte explains that the approach is to determine what is minimally necessary to accomplish the tasks. That is, there are some &quot;wants&quot; and then there are some &quot;musts.&quot; The musts get the priority.

<P>For example, one piece of equipment developed for engine assembly is a con-rod tightening station that is capable of handling two different-size con rods. Jutte ticks off the benefits of using this single unit rather than two, including reduced floor space and fewer maintenance requirements. The must was to have con rod tightening. Although an ordinary approach would have probably involved two stations, that was determined to be a want. So the single station was developed.

<P>Jutte observes, &quot;We could have spent another $100-million in assembly if we hadn't gone the zero-base route.&quot;</I>
