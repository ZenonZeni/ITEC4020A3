<P>Living and working in what is now called the information society will
develop business competitiveness, improve levels of skill and increase the
potential for economic growth in the City and region. Stoke-on-Trent is joining
the information society with its ambitious plans to develop a digital centre of
excellence - to be known as The Worldgate Centre - as a major step
towards becoming a digital city. </P>

<P>Through a series of public and private sector forum events, held over recent
years, a positive vision for the City of Stoke-on-Trent has emerged. This vision
seeks to harness the City's potential - a skilled and adaptable workforce, a
strategic location, a growing education and information technology
infrastructure - and direct this towards achieving greater economic prosperity.</P>
<P>Building on past successes, significant contributions and investment will
continue to be made for the community to be able to enjoy the benefits of a high
quality of life and a safe, healthy and pleasant environment.</P>
