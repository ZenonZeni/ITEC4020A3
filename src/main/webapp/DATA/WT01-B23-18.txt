            the government codified existing practices regarding
            the maintenance of addicts on heroin and morphine by

            a humane regard for the addicts in their care,

            addiction: &quot;Me condition must be regarded as a

            <p>When the Brain Committee first met at the
            invitation of the minister of health, its mission was
            to review the advice given by the Rolleston Committee
            in 1926. That advice had been to continue to allow
            doctors to treat addicts with maintenance doses of
            powerful drugs when the doctors deemed it medically
            helpful for the patient. Brain I reiterated that
            advice and in this first report recommended no
            changes of any significance on the prescribing powers
            of doctors. This report expanded on one important
            point alluded to in Rolleston-the authenticity of the
            existence of &quot;stabilized addicts.&quot; </p>
            <p>While many American experts doubt their existence,
            this report explained, &quot;careful scrutiny of the
            histories of more than a hundred persons classified
            as addicts reveals that many of them who have been
            taking small and regular doses for years show little
            evidence of tolerance and are often leading
            reasonably satisfactory lives.&quot; Six &quot;case
            histories of known stabilized addicts&quot; were
            included in an appendix. They were mature, older
            patients, functioning normally on what would be huge
            doses of drugs by American standards. &quot;Mr.
            F.,&quot; for example, a clerical worker, was
            receiving the equivalent of 200 milligrams of
            morphine tablets each day. It is likely that these
            patients and their doctors would be dealt with as
            criminals in the United States. </p>

            <p>This report was the result of the only major
            combined study of drug policy made by two of the most
            important professional societies in the country.
            Chaired by attorney Rufus King of Washington, D.C..
            the committee presented a direct challenge to the
            tough policies of Federal Bureau of Narcotics
            Director Harry Anslinger, a philosophical ancestor of
            the previous &quot;drug czar,&quot; William Bennett.
            The blue-ribbon committee included a senior federal
            judge and was advised by Indiana University's Alfred
            Lindesmith, one of the most distinguished addiction
            scholars in history. The report observed, &quot;Drug
            addiction is primarily a problem for the physician
            rather than the policeman, and it should not be
            necessary for anyone to violate the criminal law
            solely because he is addicted to drugs.&quot; The
            report concluded that drug addiction was a disease,
            not a crime, that harsh criminal penalties were
            destructive, that drug prohibition ought to be
            reexamined, and that experiments should be conducted
            with British-style maintenance clinics for narcotic
            addicts. </p>

            <p>Brain II has been consistently misinterpreted by

            recommend the dismantling of the British prescription
            system nor the compulsory registration of addicts, as
            has been claimed. Instead, Brain II urged that </p>

                <li>doctors who wished to prescribe
                    &quot;restricted drugs&quot; to addicts for
                    the purpose of maintenance be required to
                    obtain a special license from the Home
                    Office; </li>
                <li>treatment centers be established for treating
                    addicts who were to be regarded as sick and
                    not criminal; and </li>
                <li>doctors and other medical personnel be
                    mandated to &quot;notify&quot; the Home
                    Office when they encountered an addict in the
                    course of their professional work.
                    Originally, the category of restricted drugs
                    included heroin and cocaine; now, dipipanone
                    has been added. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The core of the British system remains, however,
            and in recent years has been reinvigorated.
            Approximately 200 doctors with special licenses are
            free to prescribe all drugs, including the restricted
            medicines, for maintenance of addicts. Also, any
            doctor, unlike those in the U.S., may prescribe all
            of the other drugs for maintenance, including, for
            example, injectable morphine and methadone. Brain II
            in the end was aimed at controlling a few
            overprescribing doctors, not at adopting the American
            system of treating addicts as the enemy. </p>

                    came in Utah in 1915 and was enacted into law
                    along with a number of other Mormon religious
                    prohibitions. </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>The early state marijuana laws in the
                    Southwest and West were passed because
                    &quot;All Mexicans are crazy and marijuana is
                    what makes them crazy.&quot; That is, they
                    were the result of racial prejudice against
                    newly arrived Mexican immigrants. </li>
                <li>The other early state marijuana laws were
                    passed out of the fear that opiate addicts,
                    who had been deprived of legal access to
                    opiates by the Harrison Tax Act of 1914,
                    would turn to marijuana. In other words, they
                    were afraid that opiate use would lead to
                    marijuana. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first Federal prohibition on marijuana was
            passed for reasons which can only be described as
            &quot;nonsense,&quot; including the racial reasons
            listed above, as well as allegations that marijuana
            caused young lovers to elope. Interested readers may

            <p>A 1972 report to the Ford Foundation,
            &quot;Dealing With Drug Abuse,&quot; concluded that
            current drug policies were unlikely to eliminate or
            greatly affect drug abuse. This conclusion led to the
            creation and joint funding by four major foundations
            of a broadly based, independent national Drug Abuse
            Council. The council reviewed and assessed laws,
            programs, and projects-federal, state, and local,
            private and governmental-related to use and misuse of
            psychoactive drugs. In its final report, the
            council's board of directors offered a set of
            observations considered central to the process of
            reaching mom consistent, coherent, and responsible
            approaches to drug use and misuse. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Psychoactive substances have been available
                    throughout recorded history and will remain
                    so. To try to eliminate them completely is
                    unrealistic. </li>
                <li>The use of psychoactive drugs is pervasive,
                    but misuse is much less frequent, and the
                    failure to make the distinction between use
                    and misuse creates the impression that all
                    use is misuse and leads to addiction. </li>
                <li>There is a clear relationship between drug
                    misuse and pervasive societal ills such as
                    poverty, racial discrimination, and
                    unemployment, and we can expect drug misuse
                    so long as these adverse social conditions
                    exist. </li>
                <li>The price of an effective strategy to
                    eliminate drug misuse through the criminal
                    law would be perceived by many Americans as
                    too high in terms of invasions of privacy and
                    abrogations of individual liberties. </li>
                <li>Drug laws and policies attend insufficiently
                    to the problems of people misusing drugs and
                    too much to the properties of drugs
                    themselves, as though the drugs were somehow
                    inherently to blame. </li>
                <li>Too many Americans have unrealistic
                    expectations about what drug policies and
                    programs can accomplish. </li>
                <li>We have a regrettable tendency to blame our
                    drug problems on others, failing to recognize
                    that our drug problems are products of our
                    own national experience. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The council's directors then offered a set of
            suggestions, Principal among them are the following, </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Treatment for drug dependence should be
                    available chiefly because people need help,
                    rather than as a crime control or behavior
                    control method. </li>
                <li>There should be a major study of the effects
                    of drug laws and their enforcement on
                    personal decisions to use or not use illicit
                    drugs. </li>
                <li>Legislative efforts to decriminalize at both
                    state and federal levels the possession of
                    small amounts of marijuana for personal use
                    should continue. </li>
                <li>The report ends with the recommendation:
                    &quot;... that serious consideration be given
                    to the use of state and local option as a
                    means of attempting solutions appropriate in
                    one place but not in others. Local options
                    could encourage greater flexibility and
                    ingenuity rather than reliance on an
                    unrealistic, rigid homogeneity in national
                    drug policy. We need to respond to the
                    diversity of people who use and misuse drugs,
                    base all our policies on a consistent set of
                    principles seeking to discourage misuse, and
                    keep our seemingly innate drug-using behavior
                    within reasonable limits through means. which
                    do not themselves produce more harm than they
                    prevent. </li>

            <p>The NAS Committee on Substance Abuse and Habitual
            Behavior was composed of some of the leading American
            experts on medicine, addiction treatment, law,
            business, and public policy. These experts reviewed
            all of the available evidence on every aspect of the
            marijuana question. The committee then recommended
            that the country experiment with a system that would
            allow states to set up their own methods of
            controlling marijuana as is now done with alcohol.
            Under this approach, federal criminal penalties would
            be removed, and each state could decide to legalize
            the drug and impose regulations concerning hours of
            sale, age limits, and taxation. </p>
            <p>In the same vein as all the previous major
            objective studies, this report stated that excessive
            marijuana use could cause serious harm, that such use
            was rare, and that, on balance, the current policy of
            total prohibition was socially and personally
            destructive. The report placed great emphasis on
            building up public education and informal social
            controls, which often have a greater impact on drug
            abuse than the criminal law. Regarding the
            possibility of disaster for our youth under
            legalization, the report observed: </p>
            <p>There is reason to believe that widespread
            uncontrolled use would not occur under regulation.
            Indeed, regulation might facilitate patterns of
            controlled use by diminishing the &quot;forbidden
            fruit&quot; aspect of the drug and perhaps increasing
            the likelihood that an adolescent would be introduced
            to the drug through families and friends, who
            practice moderate use, rather than from their
            heaviest-using, most drug-involved peers, </p>

            <p>&quot;The spread of HIV is a greater danger to
            individual and public health than drug misuse,&quot;
            declared the leading drug abuse and health experts of
            the United Kingdom who sit on this distinguished
            quasi-governmental advisory group. This concept
            operated as the guiding principle in this commission
            report, one part issued in 1988, another in 1989. In
            stark contrast to the Bush administration's war
            plans, the British council provided a comprehensive
            health plan that seeks to prevent the use of drugs,
            as is the American goal. However, the plan has
            realistic goals regarding drug abusers; abstinence in
            the American mode, where possible, but above all
            else, health and life. Thus, the Advisory Council
            accepted the lessons of the &quot;harm
            reduction&quot; programs of the Liverpool area and
            recommended that they be spread to the entire United
            Kingdom. Some of these lessons involve needle
            exchanges and prescribed drugs for addicts. </p>
            <p>The report even went beyond the Liverpool
            experience when these leading British experts quietly
            observed, &quot;We believe that there is a place for
            an expansion of residential facilities where drug
            misusers may gain better health, skills, and
            self-confidence whilst in receipt of prescribed
            drugs.&quot; Thus, while the United States is
            planning more prison space for drug addicts, the
            United Kingdom is contemplating more hostels where
            addicts could be taught to live more healthy, more
            self-confident and more productive lives in the
            community. </p>

            recommended a move toward the formulation of
            &quot;legislation aiming at regulation and
            decriminalization&quot; and the winding down of the
            war on drugs. </p>
            <p>The Research Advisory Panel made three specific
            recommendations for initial legislative action. These
            were </p>
            <ol>
                <li>permit the possession of syringes and
                    needles; </li>
                <li>permit the cultivation of marijuana for
                    personal use; and </li>
                <li>in order to project an attitude of
                    disapproval of all drug use, take a token
                    action in forbidding the sale or consumption
                    of alcohol in state-supported institutions
                    devoted in part or whole to patient care or
                    educational activity. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The panel recommended immediate and innovative
            action, concluding it is &quot;incontrovertible that
            whatever policies we have been following over the
            past generations must not be continued unexamined and
            unmodified since our actions to date have favored the
            development of massive individual and societal
            problems.&quot; </p>

            <p>This indictment of current drug policy focuses on
            the relationship between the spread of HIV and drug
            use. The commission criticized the federal
            government's failure to recognize that these are twin
            epidemics and found that the &quot;strategy of
            interdiction and increased prison sentences has done
            nothing to change the stark statistics&quot; showing
            spread of AIDS by drug users. The commission singled
            out the Office of National Drug Control Policy for
            ignoring AIDS and &quot;neglecting the real public
            health and treatment measures which could and must be
            taken to halt the spread.&quot; </p>
            <p>The commission put forward five recommendations: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Expand drug treatment so that all who apply
                    for treatment can be accepted into treatment
                    programs. </li>
                <li>Remove legal barriers to the purchase and
                    possession of injection equipment. </li>
                <li>The federal government must take the lead in
                    developing and maintaining programs to
                    prevent HIV transmission related to licit and
                    illicit drugs. </li>
                <li>Research and epidemiologic studies on the
                    relationships between licit and illicit drug
                    use and HIV transmission should be greatly
                    expanded and funding should be increased, not
                    reduced or merely held constant. </li>
                <li>All levels of government and the private
                    sector need to mount a serious and sustained
                    attack on the social problems of poverty,
                    homelessness, and lack of medical care that
                    promote licit and illicit drug use in
                    American society. </li>
            </ol>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The National Commission on AIDS could be described
            as the echo of the British Advisory Council on the
            misuse of drugs in its report on AIDS and drug
            misuse, as it made virtually the same policy
            recommendations. The commission concluded that
            &quot;the federal government must recognize that HIV
            and substance use is one of the issues of paramount
            concern within the 'war on drugs.' Any program which
            does not deal with the duality of the HIV/drug
            epidemic is destined to fail.&quot; The commission
            urged the federal government to move away from a law
            enforcement approach in controlling drugs toward a
            public health approach, which to date has &quot;been
            seriously neglected.&quot; </p>
