<P>
Lattice gas methods have been devised to assist in understanding
the properties of real fluids. Potentially, therefore, they could
provide an alternative to conventional computational fluid dynamic
(CFD) analysis for predicting air flow patterns. This new approach
approximates reality by constraining motions and collisions of
fluid 'particles' to a 'lattice', where each particle represents
a finite mass of fluid. Simplification takes place by reducing
the near infinite motion characteristics of a real fluid to a
very restricted set of discrete particle speeds and directions.
<P>
A typical lattice for flow in 2-dimensions is illustrated in Figure
1. Particles are restricted to moving along propagation lines
and collide only at the intersections ('nodes') of these lines.
Each collision must observe Newton's laws of motion, namely that
momentum and mass are conserved. Various outcomes of particle
collisions are possible. In some cases the direction of particle
flow changes, while in others no change in direction occurs. Typically,
the solution algorithm incorporates a 'look-up table', in which
all the possible outcomes of collisions are stored.

This article presents an example of the application of the lattice
gas approach, and outlines some of the essential concepts. The
example is based on a method proposed by <A HREF="#Frisch" >Frisch, Hasslacher, and Pomeau (1986)  
</A>, known as an FHP model.
<H2>Lattice <A NAME="Geometry">Geometry</A></H2>

<P>
A highly symmetric lattice is needed to ensure that vorticity
(rotational motion of a fluid) is realistically simulated. <A HREF="#Hardy" >Hardy et al (1972, 1973, 1976)  
</A>showed that a basic rectangular lattice is inadequate for
this purpose. However, <A HREF="#Frisch" >Frisch et al (1986)  
</A>concluded that for flow in 2-dimensions, a hexagonal lattice,
illustrated in Figure 1, is satisfactory. Three-dimensional flow
is more difficult to model, but has been simulated using a 'face
centred hyper-cubic' (FCHC) lattice. (See <A HREF="#Rivet" >Frisch et al, 1987  
</A>.) Although particles must move along the propagation lines,
the velocity (i.e. speed and direction) components can nevertheless
be resolved to generate the full flow field.
<P>
Analogous to wind tunnel experiments, lattice flow has to be scaled
to correspond to the correct flow regime (i.e. laminar, transitional,
or turbulent flow). This is characterised by the Reynolds number.
By increasing the number of nodes, and hence the Reynolds number,
features such as the onset and development of turbulence automatically
emerge. A disadvantage is that turbulent flow currently requires
many thousands of nodes.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337880800"></A><A NAME="Collision"></A>Collision
Rules</H2>

<P>
A set of collision rules must be specified. These fall into the
categories of 'trivial' collisions, which result in no change
in direction of colliding particles, and 'non-trivial' collisions,
involving a change of direction of some or all of the particles.
Collisions throughout the entire lattice are assumed to occur
simultaneously and at 'unit' time steps. Following collision,
they then arrive at their new nodes. The resultant propagation
of particles simulates the movement of fluid throughout the space.
<P>
In 2 dimensions, using an FHP model, there are 64 possibilities
for a collision at each node. The outcome of each possible collision
is chosen so that the number of particles present before and after
is preserved. In addition, the total of the momenta of all the
particles involved remains constant. The number of particles and
the momentum should be the only conserved quantities in any collision.
As a consequence, some collisions result in more than one outcome.
When this happens, the outcome is selected at random. The complete
set of non-trivial collision rules, as proposed by <A HREF="#Hénon" >Hénon (1987)  
</A>, is given as follows, and results in up to 72 distinct outcomes:
<OL>
<LI>head-on (2 particles) - 3 possibilities, each with 2 possible
outcomes (see Figure 2a),
<LI>triple (3 particles) - 2 possibilities, each with 2 possible
outcomes (including 1 trivial, see Figure 2b),
<LI>head-on with spectator (3 particles) - 12 possibilities, each
with 1 possible outcome (see Figure 2c), and
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>binary head-on (4 particle) - 3 possibilities, each with 2
possible outcomes (see Figure 2d).
</OL>

<P>
Perimeter obstructions to flow (e.g. walls, floors, and ceilings)
and internal obstructions (e.g. furniture and people) are realised
by setting 'solid boundary nodes'. Implementing the condition
of 'no-slip' (i.e. zero parallel fluid velocity) at such boundaries
is illustrated in Figure 3. On reaching a solid surface, particles
are returned along the same propagation line.

<P>
Flow boundaries (e.g. open doors, windows, ventilation systems)
are represented by a variety of means. For example, it is possible
to introduce 'forcing rules' to simulate a linear pressure gradient,
as shown in Figure 4. This involves imposing directional flow
on the lattice particles by introducing additional <I>x</I>-momentum
at random lattice locations. The strength of pressure gradient
is increased by adding to the number of nodes and the number of
time steps at which forcing is applied. The mass flow rate into
the space (i.e. the number of particles entering the lattice per
time step) must be balanced by an identical mass flow rate out
of the space.

<H2><A NAME="Interpretation">Interpretation</A> of Lattice Dynamics
</H2>

<P>
In order to convert the discrete motions of particles into physically
meaningful quantities, it is useful to partition the lattice into
a number of rectangular 'domains'. For each domain, the average
mass and momentum densities of particles must be determined. The
average mass density of particles is given by the number of particles
within a domain divided by the number of domain nodes. (For a
2-dimensional hexagonal lattice, the overall value should be between
0 and 3 particles per node, otherwise the fluid would have unphysical
behaviour.) The average momentum density is determined by summing
the spatial co-ordinate components of the momentum of all the
particles within a domain and, again, dividing by the number of
domain nodes. An evaluation of the average particle velocity within
each domain is then made from these quantities.
<P>
Viscosity is the resistance to flow that a fluid exerts on itself
when adjacent regions of the fluid move with different velocities.
For any lattice gas model, the viscosity and hence Reynolds number
of the fluid depends on the average mass density.
<H2><A NAME="Initialising">Initialising</A> a Simulation</H2>

<P>
The lattice must be sized to set the characteristic Reynolds number
of the problem to be studied. For this model, the maximum obtainable
Reynolds number for a given lattice size occurs when there is
an average of about 2.0 particles per node, for the complete set
of collision rules stated above. An initial particle distribution
defining the true mass density of the lattice is established.
This implies an initial momentum distribution, from which the
calculation proceeds by running the model over a number of unit
time steps.
<P>
In general, simulations must be run until transient disturbances
caused by the initial conditions have disappeared. This is likely
to be a large multiple (e.g. greater than 10) of the number of
time steps taken for a particle, moving at the average velocity,
to have 'propagated through the system'. At this stage a consistent
pattern of flow may begin to emerge.
<H2>An Air Flow <A NAME="Example">Example</A></H2>

<P>
The above concepts have been incorporated into a simplistic 2-dimensional
example, as illustrated in Figure 5. A 2-dimensional office space
is modelled using 400 x 400 lattice nodes, and 40 x 40 domains
(each of 10 x 10 lattice nodes). The average mass density of the
lattice is 2.4 particles per node, yielding low Reynolds number
flow.
<P>
The upper and lower boundaries are solid, and there is a no-slip
condition at these edges. Particles reaching one side of the lattice
are fed back into the other side, with identical velocity and
at the same <I>y</I>-value. A block of three adjacent solid rectangles
provides an internal obstacle to flow, which is a crude representation
of a person sitting at a desk. A no-slip condition is also present
at these boundaries.
<P>
The air flows under isothermal forced convection, as provided,
for example, by a balanced mechanical ventilation system. The
driving force for the flow is provided by a linear pressure gradient
(in the <I>x</I>-direction in Figure 5), implemented with the
forcing rules shown in Figure 4.
<P>
Figure 5 shows the resultant velocity field after 100000 unit
time steps (which required approximately 4 hours computation time
on a 100 MHz Intel Pentium based computer). It should be noted
that the Reynolds number is perhaps too low for a full-scale ventilation
system. Clearly, therefore, this example is very idealised, but
nevertheless the potential for predicting flow using this approach
is demonstrated.

<P>
The lattice gas method presented may be used to produce qualitative
features of physical fluid behaviour. In the short term, the method
is likely to be limited to low Reynolds number applications. In
the longer term, current limitations imposed by the high storage
and processing requirements needed for turbulent flow analysis
must be overcome. This may be possible by compressing the data
stored to represent the lattice. Current work to overcome high
processing requirements includes using lattice models with parallel
computers (e.g. <A HREF="#Krafczyk" >Krafczyk and Rank, 1995  
</A>), to which they are well-suited.
<P>
The method has the positive characteristic that, subject to the
constraint of the discrete nature of the lattice, arbitrarily
complex boundaries can be included without increasing the time
needed for computations. It is also possible to track either individual
or groups of particles, so that, for instance, pollutant transport
may be studied. This approach dispenses with the need to solve
the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, since turbulence develops
naturally in lattice gas methods, artificial turbulence models,
as incorporated into conventional CFD techniques, are unnecessary.
To conclude, the lattice gas technique may prove to be a useful
tool for air flow analysis, especially with recent developments
allowing for the inclusion of buoyancy effects (e.g. see <A HREF="#Chen" >Chen et al, 1989  
</A>, and <A HREF="#Burges" >Burges and Zaleski, 1987  </A>).
