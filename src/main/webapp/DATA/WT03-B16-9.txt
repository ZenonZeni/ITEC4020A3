Using SSL
This chapter explains how to use SSL
to make the server's communications secure.
<P>
For an overview of security and an explanation
of SSL, see <A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRSEC">"Making your communications secure"</A>.

</MENU><HR><P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_765" HREF="#PToC_765">Overview of SSL security</A></H2>
<P>
HTTPS is a unique protocol that combines SSL and HTTP.
You need to specify <B>https&#58;//</B> as an anchor in HTML
documents that link to SSL-protected documents.
A client user can also open a URL by specifying <B>https&#58;//</B>
to request an SSL-protected documents.
<P>
Because HTTPS (HTTP + SSL) and HTTP are different protocols and
usually use different ports (443 and 80, respectively), you can
run both SSL and non-SSL requests at the same time.
As a result, you can choose to provide information to all users
using no security, and specific information only to browsers who
make secure requests.
This is how a retail company on the Internet can allow users to
look through the merchandise without security, but then fill
out order forms and send their credit card numbers using security.
<P>
A browser that does not have support for HTTP over SSL will
naturally not be able to request URLs using HTTPS.
The non-SSL browsers will not allow submission of forms that
need to be submitted securely.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSSLSET" HREF="#PToC_766">Step 1. Setting up SSL</A></H2>
<P>
To implement security you need to specify the port
you'll use for secure network communications.
If the server needs to ensure who a client is before responding,
you need to set up SSL client authentication.
When you set up SSL client authentication, the server requests
a client's certificate whenever the client makes an
<B>https</B> request.
<P>
Also, the server must have a
public-private key pair and a certificate.
<P>
The server uses its private key to sign messages to clients.
The server sends its public key to clients so that they
can encrypt messages to the server, which the server decrypts
with its private key.
<P>
To send its public key to clients, the server needs a certificate.
The certificate contains the server's public key, the Distinguished
Name associated with the server's certificate, the serial number
of the certificate, and the expiration date of the certificate.
<P>
A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA),
who verifies that you are who you say you are.
<P>
To conduct commercial business on the Internet, you would
use a CA, such as VeriSign, Inc.,
who is widely known by clients and servers to get a server
certificate.
If you plan to implement SSL client authentication, clients can
also get their certificates from a CA such as Verisign.
The VeriSign home
page at <B>https://www.verisign.com/enroll.s</B> contains instructions
for how clients can obtain certificates.
<P>
For a private Web network within your own company, university,
or group, you could, with your Internet Connection Secure Server, be your own CA.
To learn how to become your own CA and process
certificates for this server and other clients and servers,
see <A HREF="icswg013.html#HDROWNCA">"Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network"</A>.
<P>
Use the following <B>Configuration and Administration forms</B>
to set up SSL security:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Security Configuration form to specify the port that will be
used for SSL
<LI>Create Key and Request Certificate form to create the server's
public-private key pair and certificate request
<LI>Receive Certificate form to receive the server's certificate
into a key ring so that the server can use it
for secure network communications
</UL>
<P>
To access the Configuration and Administration forms:
<OL>
<P><LI>Go to the front page of your server and
click <B>Configuration and Administration forms</B>.
<P><LI>You are prompted for your user name and password.
Type them in and click <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>The <B>Configuration and Administration forms</B> page appears.
Page down until you find the topic Security.
To access any security form listed, click its name.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRSSLCONF" HREF="#PToC_767">Fill in Security Configuration form</A></H3>
<P>
Use the <B>Security Configuration</B> form
to specify some of the security
information needed for your server.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_768">1. Specify connection options</A></H4>
<P>
Use the first part of the <B>Security Configuration</B>
form to specify your connection for SSL and to set up SSL
client authentication.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b01.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b01 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
Check the box to allow SSL connections and, optionally,
to allow HTTP connections.
In addition, if the server needs to verify who a client is
before responding, you can check the box to
set up SSL client authentication.
Authenticating clients increases network traffic.
If you set up SSL client authentication, the server requests
a certificate when a client makes an <B>https</B> request.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_769">2. Process your request</A></H4>
<P>
Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly.
Click <B>Apply</B> to process the form.
<P>
You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed.
You can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.
However, when you are ready for the changes
you've made to this form to take effect,
you must stop the server and then start it again.
The server will not pick up your changes if you only restart it.
<P>
For SSL, the server must have a public-private key pair
and a certificate.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_770" HREF="#PToC_770">Fill in Create Key and Request Certificate form</A></H3>
<P>
These instructions tell you how to use this form
to do one of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Create a key pair and request a certificate
for the server from VeriSign.
<P><LI>Create a key pair and request a certificate
for the server from a CA other than VeriSign.
The other CA could be some other outside CA.
Or, someone within your organization could act
as a CA for a private Web network; for example,
you might act as your own CA and the CA for others in your group.
If you are acting as a CA, you need to follow
the instructions in <A HREF="icswg013.html#HDROWNCA">"Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network"</A>.
The chapter tells how to become a CA and
how to process certificate requests.
</UL>
<P>
To create the server's public-private key pair
and request a certificate, use:
<UL>
<P><LI>The Create Key and Request Certificate form to choose your CA
<P><LI>One of the following forms, depending on the CA you choose,
to create the server's keys and request its certificate:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>VeriSign Low Assurance Certificate
<LI>VeriSign Secure Server Certificate
<LI>Other Certificate
</UL>
</UL>
<P>

VeriSign is a widely known CA.
Choose one:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>VeriSign (Low Assurance Certificate)</B>: The
level of proof required to get a low assurance
certificate is less than for a secure server certificate.
You might want to get a low assurance certificate
to do a beta test of security with your clients
or for some other non-commercial purpose.
<P><LI><B>VeriSign (Secure Server Certificate)</B>: To
conduct commercial business on the Internet,
you want a secure server certificate.
The level of proof required to get a secure server certificate is
higher than for a low assurance certificate.
<P><LI><B>Other</B>:  This is any other CA.
For example, for a private Web network, your organization
could choose to act as its own CA.

<P>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_774">Specify key name</A></H5>
<P>
Specify a meaningful, unique name to identify the key pair.
The <B><I>key name</I></B> is the label that identifies
the key pair and certificate in the key ring.
You may use non-alphanumeric characters in key names; however,
keep in mind that some platforms have special uses for
some of these characters.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_775">Specify key ring</A></H5>
<P>
Specify the fully qualified path and file name for the key ring file.
A <B><I>key ring</I></B> is a file where the server
keeps one or more key pairs and certificates.
If you specify a file that doesn't exist,
the server creates the file for you.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_776">Specify the size of the key pair</A></H5>
<P>
Specify the size of the key pair in bits
after considering these factors:
<UL>
<P><LI>The more bits you specify for the key pair,
the more secure your communications.
<P><LI>The more bits you specify, the more processing time
required for encryption and decryption.
<P><LI>With export versions of the server,
you can create a key pair up to 512 bits.
With U.S.-Canadian versions, you can create a larger key pair
up to 1024 bits; however, if you want clients outside
the United States to encrypt messages to the server,
U.S. export rules require that the key pair be no larger
than 512 bits.
If you want clients outside the United States only to verify your
server's signature or sign messages,
the key pair can be larger than 512 bits.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_777">4. Specify key ring password</A></H4>
<P>
Use this part of the form to specify the password that protects
the key ring.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b03.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b03 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The password must be from the U.S. English character set.
<P>
The password is important because
it protects the server's private key.
The server's private key is the only key that can decrypt
messages encrypted with the server's public key.
Also, the server signs documents with its private key.
<P>
The security of the server's private key
depends upon this password.
Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords:
<UL>
<P><LI>Make the password at least six characters.
<P><LI>Make sure the password doesn't spell a word.
<P><LI>Make sure the password doesn't consist of publicly
obtainable information about you; for example,
the initials and birth date for you, your spouse, or children.
<P><LI>Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password.
</UL>
<P>
Type the password twice to ensure
that you have typed it correctly.
<P>
If you must record the password, make sure
it is stored in a well-secured place.
<P>
The key ring password must be specified when the server is started.
Check <B>Automatic login</B> if you want the server to stash
the password and specify it for you whenever the server is started.
To stash the password, the server
encrypts the key ring password and puts it in a file
that has the same name as the key ring file,
except the extension is .sth.
<P>
Stashing your password is less secure so
it's generally a good practice not to stash it.
However, there may be cases where you need to stash the password;
for example, if you have a remote server and you want it to
automatically restart after a power failure.
<P>
Next, to request the server's certificate,
fill in the rest of the form.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_778">5. Specify Distinguished Name</A></H4>
<P>
Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with the server's
certificate and used to identify the server's public key.
In it's simplest form, a Distinguished Name is someone's name.
<P>
The information you provide for Distinguished Name depends upon
whether you want a:
<UL>
<P><LI>VeriSign Low Assurance Certificate.
See <A HREF="#HDRDNLOWS">"Specify Distinguished Name for low assurance certificate"</A>.
<P><LI>VeriSign Secure Server Certificate or Other Certificate.
See <A HREF="#HDRDNHIGHS">"Specify Distinguished Name for secure server or other certificate"</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRDNLOWS">Specify Distinguished Name for low assurance certificate</A></H5>
<P>
For this certificate, the Distinguished Name is the full name
of the user for whom the certificate is being requested.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b04.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b04 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
For <B>User's full name</B>, specify the user's full name
and make sure it is unique.
For example, if you request more than one certificate for Mary Ann
Jones, you might specify Mary Ann Jones1 for the first
request and Mary Ann Jones2 for the second request.
<P>
<B>User's e-mail address</B> should contain the user's address
where you want VeriSign to mail the certificate.
<P>
Next, you need to provide mailing information,
as described in <A HREF="#HDRMAILTOS">"6. Specify mailing option"</A>.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRDNHIGHS">Specify Distinguished Name for secure server or other certificate</A></H5>
<P>
For these certificates, the Distinguished Name
is the server name and the location of the server.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b11.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b11 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>The text for Distinguished Name will vary, depending on
whether you're on the VeriSign Secure Server Certificate form or
the Other Certificate form.
Also, the User's e-mail address field, which is on the
Other Certificate form, is not on the VeriSign
Secure Server Certificate form.
<P>
You may use non-alphanumeric characters in Distinguished Name;
however, keep in mind that some platforms have special uses
for some of these characters.
Provide the following information for Distinguished Name:
<UL>
<P><LI>Server Name:  The X.500 common name of the server.
Usually, it is the TCP/IP fully qualified host name;
for example, www.ibm.com.
For a VeriSign secure server certificate request,
it must be the fully qualified host name.
<P><LI>Organizational Unit:  Optionally, the organizational unit.
For example, you might specify the division of your company.
<P><LI>Organization:  The name of your organization, such as
the name of your company.
For a secure server certificate, if you already have an account
with VeriSign, the name in this field should match the name on
that account.
<P><LI>Locality/City:  Optionally, the city or locality where your
server resides.
<P><LI>State/Province:  The state or province where the server resides.
You must specify at least <B>three</B> characters.
<P><LI>Postal Code:  The postal code or zip code where the server resides.
<P><LI>Country:  The two-character country code for the
country in which the server resides.
</UL>
<P>
On the Other Certificate form, <B>User's e-mail address</B>
should contain the user's address where
you want the CA to mail the certificate.
If you're requesting this server's certificate, which you plan to
process as a CA, leave this field blank.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRMAILTOS">6. Specify mailing option</A></H4>
<P>
The mailing option depends on the kind of certificate being requested:
<UL>
<P><LI>For a VeriSign low assurance certificate,
see <A HREF="#HDRMAILLS">"Mailing option for low assurance certificate"</A>.
<P><LI>For a VeriSign secure server certificate,
see <A HREF="#HDRMAILHS">"Mailing option for secure server certificate"</A>.

see <A HREF="#HDRMAILOS">"Mailing option for other certificate"</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRMAILLS">Mailing option for low assurance certificate</A></H5>
<P>
A VeriSign low assurance certificate request must be
electronically mailed to VeriSign.
If you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.

<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRMAILHS">Mailing option for secure server certificate</A></H5>
<P>
There is no mailing option on the form for a VeriSign secure server
certificate.
A secure server certificate request must be saved in a file
and manually mailed to VeriSign.
The VeriSign home page, <B>https:;//www.verisign.com/enroll.s</B>,
has instructions on what you need to provide in order
to obtain a secure server certificate from VeriSign.
Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be used
to send a certificate request.
For example, some programs may pad the lines of a certificate
request with blanks and invalidate it.
Also, if you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.
<P>
Go to <A HREF="#HDRCOPYS">"7. Save copy of certificate request"</A> for a description
of what you need to do next.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRMAILOS">Mailing option for other certificate</A></H5>

If you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.
<P><LI><B>Don't mail</B>:  Choose this option
if you plan to act as your own CA for this server's certificate
or if you don't want to electronically mail the certificate
request to another CA at this time.
You can manually mail the certificate request later;
however, some e-mail programs may alter files and
should not be used to send a certificate request.
For example, some programs may pad the lines
of a certificate request with blanks and invalidate it.
Also, if you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRCOPYS">7. Save copy of certificate request</A></H4>
<P>
It's a good idea to save the certificate request in a file.
If you're requesting a VeriSign secure server certificate,
you must save the request to file and manually mail it later.
If you're acting as your own CA for this server's certificate,
you also must save the certificate request in a file.
(After you complete this form, you can

<P>
Before filling in this form, use your e-mail program to
receive the certificate into a unique file.
Some e-mail programs may alter files and
should not be used to receive certificates.
For example, some programs pad the lines of the certificate
with trailing blanks, which invalidates it.
<P>
For the Receive Certificate form, provide:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Name of file containing certificate</B>:  The
fully qualified path and file name of the
file that contains the certificate.
<P><LI><B>Key ring</B>:  The fully qualified path and
file name of the key ring.
This is the key ring you specified on the Create Key and
Request Certificate form when you created the server's
public-private key pair and the request for this certificate.
<P><LI><B>Key ring password</B>:  The password for the key ring.
This is the password you specified on the Create Key and
Request Certificate form when you created the server's
public-private key pair and the request for this certificate.

After you receive your Confirmation for the Receive Certificate form,
you can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.
However, when you are ready for the changes
you've made to any security forms to take effect,
you must stop the server and then start it again.
The server will not pick up your changes if you only restart it.
<P>
When you start the server, you will be prompted for
the key ring password unless you stashed it
by selecting <B>Automatic login</B>
on the Create Key and Request Certificate form.

<H2><A NAME="Header_790" HREF="#PToC_790">Step 2. Specifying SSL client authentication in protection setups and ACL files</A></H2>
<P>
With SSL V3, you can set up your server for SSL client
authentication.
The server requests a certificate from any client
making an <B>https</B> request.
The server establishes a secure connection whether or not the
client has a valid certificate.
<P>
You can restrict who can access documents by
using password files and/or user or group authentication in protection
setups as described in <A HREF="icswg009.html#HDRPRT">"Protecting your server"</A>.
You can further restrict who can access documents by coding
SSL client authentication parameters on protection setups,
ACL files, or both.
See <A HREF="icswg009.html#HDRSSLPROT">"Creating protection setups for SSL client authentication"</A>
for more information on coding protection setups.
See <A HREF="icswg009.html#HDRUSEACLF">"Step 5. Limiting access to individual files"</A>
