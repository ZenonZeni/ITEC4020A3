<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Health problems common in the United States such as obesity,
diverticular disease and heart attacks are practically unknown in
parts of the world where more food fiber is eaten. It is well
known that proper amounts of dietary fiber can aid in bowel
regularity. Since dietary fiber is not assimilated by the body,
it contributes no calories and can help a person lose weight and
keep it off once the desired weight is reached. Control of
obesity is extremely important since it has been linked to adult
onset diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health problems.
Also, certain dietary fibers have been shown to help reduce and
alleviate high cholesterol in the blood. <br>
<br>
A double blind study compared glucomannan fiber supplement
against a method placebo in obese patients. Patients were given
instructions to use the supplement or placebo for weight
reduction. Over a 4-week period a highly significant weight loss
of 5.3 pounds occurred in 10 obese patients who supplemented
their diet with glucomannan. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides,
and LDL were lowered over an 8-week period when 3 gm/day of
glucomannan were taken.</p>
<hr>
<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>Glucomannan is a component of the Konjac root, a food used in
Japan. For over 1000 years Konjac (Amorphophallus konjac) has
been cultivated and eaten in Japan and parts of China. Common
foods such as sukiyaki use Konjac in the form of noodles. Other
uses for Konjac are as a food thickener and jelly. <br>
<br>
The main constituent of Konjac jelly is glucomannan which
accounts for 10% of the total dry material. Purified glucomannan
is prepared by washing. Starch, protein, and water-soluble
materials are removed to yield 60-90% pure glucomannan
preparation. Glucomannan is a high molecular weight carbohydrate
that chemically resembles cellulose. However, while cellulose
consists almost entirely of glucose molecules linked by beta b
1-4 saccharide bonds, glucomannan consists of glucose and mannose
molecules linked by beta b 1-4 bonds. These small chemical
differences account for the unique physical properties of
glucomannan. Cellulose is insoluble and absorbs only 5 to 10
times its weight in water, while glucomannan is soluble and
absorbs as much as 200 times its weight in water. <br>
<br>
Glucomannan when mixed with water forms a viscous solution. In a
1-2% solution, glucomannan will have a viscosity of over 100,000
centipoise. The viscosity of glucomannan increases slowly for a
maximum viscosity at 5 hours. Consequently when used as a dietary
supplement, people are advised to take glucomannan from 1/2 hour
up to 2 hours before meals with 8 ounces of water. This allows
time for water absorption, gel formation, and proper dispersion. <br>
<br>
Glucomannan acts as a dietary fiber to increase viscosity and
moisture content of the food bolis during digestion. The food
mixes with the viscous glucomannan to form a smooth, soft mass
which easily moves through the gastrointestinal tract. Since
glucomannan forms a nondigestible coating around food particles,
food is digested at a slower rate. The gel slows the action of
digestive enzymes to release sugars and fats at an even rate.
This effect is desirable in treating obesity and diabetes
mellitus.<br>
<br>
The bulk-forming property of glucomannan helps fill the stomach
to satisfy the appetite. Because digestion is slowed, large highs
in blood glucose are avoided and normal blood sugar levels are
maintained after a meal. This aids in controlling overeating and
helps fight the &quot;snack attacks&quot; which occur when blood
glucose drops 2 hours after a meal. With glucomannan (and some
other food fibers) gradual digestion &quot;times release&quot; of
sugar helps maintain sugar at normal levels without wide<br>
swings in blood levels. <br>

<p><br>
Japanese workers have had good results in treating diabetes with
glucomannan. Sugar absorption was slowed and blood sugar levels
were reported stabilized when glucomannan was used in the diets
of noninsulin dependent diabetics. <br>
<br>
It is well known that certain dietary fibers absorb cholesterol,
bile acid, and lipids. Glucomannan's gel-forming properties
promote absorption of fats and reduce serum cholesterol and
triglycerides. Japanese researchers reported glucomannan had
hypocholesterolemic properties in rat feeding trials. In elderly
humans significant decreases in serum cholesterol, triglycerides,
and free fatty acids were reported when glucomannan was added to
the diet. Two-thirds of these elderly patients also reported that
glucomannan had anticonstipation properties.</p>
<hr>
<h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS </h2>
<p>In the present study 20 patients (10 obese and 10 not obese)
were given a glucomannan supplement and 20 (10 obese and 10 not
obese) given a placebo. Strict adherence was given to double
blind procedures. Neither patients nor dietitians who interviewed
patients were informed as to what the capsule contained. Each
patient was given the same brand of Glucomannan capsules or a
placebo and was instructed to take 2 capsules 3 times per day
with 8 ounces of water 2 hours before meals. Each capsule
contained 500 mg of purified Glucomannan from Konjac root. The 10
obese patients were informed that they were testing a weight
reduction supplement. All patients were to eat their regular
meals. The supplement was intended to help curb appetite and
enable them to eat less for weight loss. No special diet was
given. <br>
<br>
Blood samples were drawn at the beginning, at 4 weeks, and at the
end of the 8 week test period. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides,
high density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, and uric
acid levels were determined. Patients were given physical exams
to establish general health. Once a week each patient was
interviewed by a dietitian, weighed, and blood pressure
determined.</p>
<hr>
<h2>WEIGHT LOSS </h2>
<p>Table 1, below, shows weight change data for 20 obese
patients: 10 who took glucomannan and 10 who were given a placebo
for 4 weeks. All 10 glucomannan patients lost weight. The largest
weight loss with glucomannan was patient E, a 180 pound female
who lost 12 pounds. The least weight loss with glucomannan was
for patient J, a 158 pound female who lost only 1.75 pounds in 4
weeks. An average weight loss of 5.33 pounds in 4 weeks was
shown. Most of the glucomannan patients observed that they had a
feeling of fullness and less than usual hunger. No reports of
diarrhea, constipation, or other adverse effects were reported by
the glucomannan supplemented group. <br>
<br>
Weight changes for the placebo group were also reported in Table
1. This group showed fluctuations in weight from a gain of 6.25
pounds to a loss of 5 pounds in 4 weeks. An average insignificant
weight loss of 0.35 pounds is shown for the placebo group. With
the placebo most patients reported no feeling of fullness or
other effect. In fact it was difficult to keep patients from
dropping out of the placebo group because they had seen little or
no effect. By contrast, the glucomannan group were quite
enthusiastic and many asked if they could continue using the
supplement after the clinical trial was completed.</p>

<h2>CHOLESTEROL DATA </h2>
<p>Serum cholesterol analyses were done on a group of 18 patients
over an 8-week period. The group was selected to cover a range of
normal to high (150-300 mg/dl). Figure 1 shows the average of 18
patients who had taken glucomannan. This data showed decline in
cholesterol over an 8-week period from 210 to 200 mg/dl. Since
the average patient had a low or normal cholesterol, little
decrease was expected. <br>
<br>
However, when 14 patients with moderate cholesterol of 200 mg/dl
or more were studied, the average cholesterol showed a
significant decrease from 220 mg/dl to 190 mg/dl in 18 weeks
(Figure 2). Even more dramatic was the decrease in cholesterol
for the 2 patients who had high cholesterol levels greater than
250 mg/dl (Figure 3). These patients decreased from an average of
270 mg/dl to 215 mg/dl after taking glucomannan for 8 weeks. The
20 patients on the placebo increased slightly in cholesterol 2
mg/dl for the same 4 and 8 week periods.</p>

<h2>LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) DATA </h2>
<p>Low density lipoproteins (LDL) are associated with cholesterol
in arteriosclerosis and are a risk factor in heart attacks. A low
level of serum LDL is desirable and is a measure of good health.
Of 18 patients who used glucomannan, the average LDL decreased
steadily over 8 weeks from 145 mg/dl to 130 mg/dl (Figure 4).
Because the average LDL was within the normal range change was
expected. However for the 4 patients with high LDL, a highly
significant decrease in LDL was observed during an 8-week period
when glucomannan was used as a diet supplement (Figure 5). The
average LDL decreased from 190 mg/dl to 145 mg/dl by the end of
the 8 week clinical test for the high LDL group. The 20 patients
using the placebo showed no significant change in LDL over 8
weeks. They dropped 4 mg the first week and gained 1 mg LDL at
eight weeks. High density lipoproteins (HDL) did not change with
glucomannans supplementation compared with the patients. However,
the nature of HDL to LDL was significantly improved because LDL
decreased when the glucomannan was used.</p>

<h2>TRIGLYCERIDES DATA </h2>
<p>Serum triglycerides were determined for 18 patients over an
8-week period. The presence of triglycerides in the blood is a
measure of the amount of calories provided by fats in the diet.
High fat diets tend to elevate serum triglycerides. Certain
weight loss diets also have shown high serum triglycerides
because body fat is being used as a predominant source of
calories. In my experience serum triglycerides change very little
with high proteins or fructose diets that I have tested in the
past. However, a significant change with glucomannan was noted
over an 8-week period. The average for 18 patients showed a small
decrease from 110 mg/dl in 8 weeks (Figure 6). However, 7
patients who had elevated triglycerides showed a highly
significant decrease in serum triglycerides from 170 mg/dl to 145
mg/dl over an 8-week period (Figure 7). The placebo group had no
significant change in triglyceride in 4-week (-1 mg at 4 weeks,
+0.1 mg at 8 weeks).</p>

<h2>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS </h2>
<p>A double blind clinical trial of glucomannan food fiber was
conducted. Two groups of 10 obese patients were given glucomannan
or a placebo over a 4-week period. The results showed that the
glucomannan supplemented group lost an average of 5.3 lbs/4
weeks, while the placebo group showed no significant weight loss.
No diet plan was given to either group. Patients were instructed
to take 2 capsules 3 times per day with 8 ounces of water 2 hours
before meals. <br>
<br>
In other tests serum cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, and
triglycerides showed highly significant decreases when patients
took glucomannan over an 8-week period. In addition, constipation
was relieved, and no adverse reactions to glucomannan were
observed. <br>
<br>
For the results of this double-blind clinical trial, it was
concluded that glucomannan (3 gm/day) was beneficial as a food
fiber supplement. Glucomannan functions as an aid to weight loss
in obese patients. Cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL serum
levels are significantly lowered in patients with elevated serum
lipid levels. Moreover, glucomannan appeared to be a safe and
highly effective food fiber supplement.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT </h2>
<p>Effect of species, cultivation district and preparation on the
hypocholesterolemic activity of crude konjac mannan (CKM) was
studied when CKM was added at the 3% level to a
hypercholesterolemic diet. Activity was correlated with the
molecular weight and molecular shape or size of KM. The most
active variety was CKM obtained from Shina-shu (Chinese species)
harvested in Gumma Prefecture, followed by Zairai-shu (Domestic
species) harvested in Saitama Prefecture and Zairai-shu harvested
in Fukushima Prefecture. Bitchu-shu, a variation of the domestic
species, harvested in Gumma Prefecture exhibited no activity. The
molecular weight of Shina-shu was about 2 X 106 and that of
Bitchu-shu, 7 X 105; the radii of gyration (RG) of these two KM
molecules which showed two extremes in activity were about 2300 A
and 1000 A, respectively. Other CKM samples tested ranged between
9 - 12 X 105 in molecular weight and 1000 - 1300 A in RG. These
results suggest that molecular weight and shape or size of KM in
aqueous solution are closely related to its hypocholesterolemic
activity. Tentatively, we have concluded that activity may be
realized if molecular weight and RG of KM molecules are above 8 -
9 X 105 and 1000 A, regardless of species, cultivation district
and preparation methods.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>The original habitat of Amorphophallus plants is thought to be
Southeast Asia. At the present, these plants grow in the
tropical, sub-tropical and temperate zones of Asia including
Japan. However, a few species are cultivated only in Japan
because edible &quot;Konnyaky&quot; is needed as a habitual
foodstuff of Japanese people. In other areas of Asia (China,
Indonesia, Burma, Thailand and Indo-China) the plants grow wild.
The tubers of Amorphophallus konjac contain a large amount of<br>
mannan (konjac mannan), which can be separated gravitationally
after crushing the dried tuber slices from other components.
Ohtsuki1 has shown that the tubers of Amorphophallus konjac
contain 20% of dry matter which yields about 64% of mannan and
10.6% of starch. The total production of CKM in Japan is
estimated at about 10,000 - 12,000 tons per year. CKM obtained by
traditional separation methods sometimes results in low molecular
weight samples because enzymatic depolymerization may occur
during drying of tuber slices in the sun. KM with high molecular
weight is obtained by homogenizing the tubers with an equal part
of ethanol and by separating it gravitationally. <br>
<br>
CKM did not lose its original activity even after extensive
purification. CKM, partially purified (PPKM) and highly purified
(HPKM) konjac mannan completely lost their plasma cholesterol
depressing activity when treated with cellulase. Moreover, the
beneficial effect of CKM, PPKM or HPKM supplemented to a
hypercholesterolemic diet was also completely canceled by the
dietary addition of cellulase. Therefore, various low molecular
contaminants in CKM do not appear to contribute to the activity
of CKM. It became increasingly apparent that an active principle
in CKM is KM itself, and that KM must be water soluble and
macromolecular in order to exhibit its hypocholesterolemic
effect. <br>
<br>
The hypocholesterolemic activity of CKM was completely eliminated
when it was irreversibly coagulated to a water insoluble form by
mixing it with small amounts of milk of lime and when it was
hydrolyzed in 0.2 N HCl at 100&#186;C for 12 hours, neutralized
and then lyophilized.2 Therefore, we have suggested that the
active substance should be a main constituent, KM, retaining both
the water soluble and macromolecular property. <br>
<br>
A series of facts concerning the hypocholesterolemic activity of
KM suggests that there may be a close correlation between
physiological activity and molecular weight of KM. On the other
hand, the quality of edible &quot;Konnyaku&quot; has been known
to depend upon the species of Amorphophallus konjac, cultivation
district and preparation method of CKM from the tubers. Physical
properties of the rigid gel produced from KM by mixing a weak
alkaline solution are widely different depending on these
factors. These facts also suggest that there are considerable
differences in molecular weight and/or the shape of KM molecules. <br>
<br>
We compared the hypocholesterolemic activity of various CKM
differing in origin and preparation method and attempted to
correlate the physiological activity with molecular weight and/or
molecular shape of KM.</p>

<h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS </h2>
<p>Male rats of the Wistar strain weighing about 100 g were used
throughout the experiment. After the animals were maintained on a
stock diet for 3 to 5 days, they were divided into groups of 5
rats each and then fed test diets for 7 days. At the end of the
experimental period, blood was drawn by heart puncture with
heparinized syringes under Nembutal anaesthesia. The liver was
rapidly excised and plasma and liver total cholesterol were
determined by the method of Pearson and associates.3 <br>
<br>
The basal (normal) diet used was of the following composition:
casein, 20%; corn oil 5%; salt mixture, 4%; vitamin mixture
triturated in lactose, 1%; choline chloride, 0.2%; and the
mixture of 1:1 pregelatinized corn starch and sucrose, 70.8%. The
hypocholesterolemic diet (control) was the basal diet
supplemented with 1% cholesterol and 0.25% sodium cholate. Test
diets were those in which each test CKM was added at the 3% level
to the control diet. The experiment was divided into three
similar trials. The animals used in experiments 1 and 2 were
purchased on the same date, the latter experiment being started
with a one-day delay after experiment 1. Experiment 3 was
initiated 10 days after the end of experiment 2.</p>
<hr>
<h2>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </h2>
<p>The results obtained in the three experiments are summarized
in Table 1. In experiment 1, only Shina-shu (Gumma) significantly
decreased plasma cholesterol levels as compared with the control
group (127 mg/100 ml vs. 198 mg/100 ml). This 36% decrease in
plasma cholesterol could not be attributed to the decrease in
food intake because the animals fed Shina-shu consumed
approximately the same amount of diet (19.6 g/day) as the control
group (17.0 g/day). A clear parallelism between plasma and liver
cholesterol levels was also observed. <br>
<br>
In experiment 2, all samples showed significant plasma
cholesterol depressing activity except Zairai-shu (Gumma).
Zairai-shu harvested in Hiroshima Prefecture appeared most active
of all samples and resulted in a 32% decrease in plasma
cholesterol from the controls. There was no significant
difference in food intake or body weight gain between rats fed
the control and Zairai-shu (Hiroshima) diets. Here again,
parallelism between plasma and liver cholesterol levels is seen.
Although there was no statistically different change between rats
fed Zairai-shu (Gumma) and the control diet in plasma cholesterol
levels, this appears to be due to the large deviation in the
values of the former. For example, the average plasma cholesterol
value of the rats fed Zairai-shu (Nagano) was about the same (140
mg/100 ml) as that of the animals eating Zairai-shu (Gumma) which
was 139 mg/100 ml; and this was significantly lower than that of
the control group. </p>
<p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In experiment 3, only Zairai-shu (Fukushima) significantly
depressed plasma cholesterol level (143 mg/100 ml as compared to
the control value of 198 mg/100 ml). This decrease amounts to
28%. Since the three experimental conditions differed slightly
from each other, the plasma cholesterol values obtained cannot be
directly compared, and per cent decrease as compared with each
control value would be a reasonable measure for relative
comparison. Accordingly, the order of activity is as follows:
Shina-Shu (Gumma) &gt; Zairai-shu (Hiroshima) &gt; Zairai-shu
(Fukushima). <br>
<br>
Konjac mannans in several samples tested were purified and their
molecular weights and radii of gyration in aqueous solution were
determined according to the procedure of Sugiyama and co-workers4
using the light scattering method.5 As shown in Figure 1, the
molecular weight of Shina-shu which was most hypocholesterolemic
was about 2 X 105 and its RG about 2000 A. In contrast, the
molecular weight of Bitchu-shu (Gumma), which had no activity,
was about 7 X 105, approximately 1/3 that of Shina-shu. </p>

    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that molecular weight and/or spreading shape in the
aqueous solution plays a significant role in physiological
activity of KM. Almost all other samples used ranged between
these 2 extremes: molecular weight, 9 - 12 X 105 and RG, about
1000 - 14000 A. These delicate differences among ordinary KM
samples could not be distinguished by the present animal
experiments. Therefore, plasma cholesterol values of rats fed
these intermediate KM samples varied from each other depending on
the experiment regardless of their order of molecular weight and
radius of gyration. As previously reported (2), it may be
reasonable to assume from the fluidity of the cellulase
hydrolysate of KM that its molecular weight is much smaller than
that of intact KM and inactive as an hypocholesterolemic agent. <br>
<br>
From the present and previous results, it would appear that the
active principle in CKM is KM itself, hypocholesterolemic
activity of KM occurs when its molecular weight and RG are above
8 - 8 X 105 and above 1000 A respectively, and when the water
soluble property is retained intact in KM.</p>

<h2>EFFECT OF GLUCOMANNAN (KONJAC FIBER) <br>
ON GLUCOSE AND LIPID METABOLISM <br>
IN NORMAL AND DIABETIC SUBJECTS</h2>
<p><em>Kunihiro Doi, Masaaki Matsuura, Akira Kawara, Rinzo
Uenoyama, and Shigeaki Baba</em></p>
<h2>RESULTS AS STATED IN THE CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>Recently, dietary fibers have been used successfully to allow
the use of lower dosages of insulin or hypoglycemic agents in the
treatment of diabetics. These fibers considered to increase the
viscosity of the gastrointestinal contents, thus slowing gastric
emptying and forming around the food a barrier that delays its
absorption by the intestinal wall (Jenkins et al., 1978). Their
viscosity appears to be a major factor in eventually suppressing,
through this mechanism, the postprandial rise of the blood
glucose level. <br>
<br>
Guar gum (galactomannan), since it was thought to be the most
viscous of the dietary fibers, was regarded as the most effective
in reducing hyperglycemia. However, our data show that the
viscosity of glucomannan is far higher than that of any other
fibers. The suppression by glucomannan of the postprandial rise
of glucose and insulin levels was more pronounced than that by
guar gum when added to the glucose solution or test meal, and
most pronounced when glucomannan was mixed into<br>
the test meal. Although the amount of glucomannan used in this
experiment was rather small, the results were good. Some of the
reasons for this have yet to be clarified, but one factor is its
very high viscosity. Moreover, its ability to absorb
carbohydrates, lipids and other high-calorie substances in the
stomach and the small intestine is the greatest among all the
dietary fibers. <br>
<br>
The serum levels of cholesterol and bile acids decreased when
glucomannan was used, but after 1 or 2 months, the serum
cholesterol levels increased for a short time. One possible
explanation of this phenomenon is that the enterohepatic
circulation of the bile acids and cholesterol was interrupted by
the absorption of these substances in the intestine by
glucomannan, which was followed by a decrease in their serum
levels. As a homeostatic response, then, the production of
cholesterol in the liver may have increased for a short period. <br>
<br>
We did not observe the serum bile acid levels over a long period,
but it is presumed that, as with cholesterol, they also increased
for a while 2 or 3 months after glucomannan was taken, and then
fell again. <br>
<br>
Serum Cu++, Fe++, Na+, K+ and Cl- levels of 6 diabetics were
followed, but no significant increase or decrease was observed. <br>
<br>
The postprandial blood glucose concentrations were lower when the
subjects were fed fiber-supplemented diets, and in some of them,
also the body weight decreased. There were some complaints of
short-lived side effects such as nausea and discomfort when
larger doses of glucomannan were given. <br>
<br>
The effects of dietary fibers on glucose metabolism may be useful
in the control of the diet and of the drug dosage of diabetics,
especially for non-insulin-dependent diabetics or obese subjects.
Further study is necessary in order to discover the metabolic and
physiological effects of these viscous forms of dietary fiber. </p>

<h2>ABSTRACT </h2>
<p>Epidemiological observations suggested that diabetics,
hyperlipidermia and coronary heart disease might be related to
deficient fiber. Therefore much interest has been shown in the
possibility of treating diabetics with fiber-rich diets. <br>
<br>
We have been studying to treat diabetics with soluble fiber,
Konjac mannan (glucomannan) which is prepared from tubers of the
Amorphophallus plant. Konjac is a normal Japanese foodstuff which
is made of crude glucomannan and water. Glucomannan (3.9 g) was
administered to normal or diabetic subjects with 50 g of glucose
or test meal to observe the changes of the post-prandial rise in
blood glucose, plasma insulin and plasma bile acids. The
decreased effect of glucomannan on the post-prandial rise of
blood glucose and insulin levels was more pronounced when it was
added to the test meal than when added to the glucose solution.
When diabetic patients supplemented ward diets with 7.8 g or 11.7
g glucomannan daily, their mean of cholesterol and fasting blood
glucose fell significantly and insulin dosage were reduced in
some patients. The endogenous bile acid load test by egg yolk
showed that gelled glucomannan absorbed bile acids in the small
intestine, and subsequently reduced in the elevation of serum
bile acids after the load. Whether carbohydrate was likely to
have been malabsorbed, 25 g xylose load test was conducted.
Addition of fiber to the test glucose solution reduced the 2-hour
urinary excretion of xylose in all cases, however when collection
of the 2-hour urinary aliquots was continued over a 6-hour
period, total amount of xylose excretion in urine was the same
for both glucomannan and control.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT </h2>
<p>The study was undertaken to investigate whether dietary fiber
is also effective in our diabetics whose dietary habits appear to
be different from those of Westerners. The effects of guar gum
and konnyaku powder consisting mainly of galactomannan and
glucomannan, respectively, on plasma glucose, IRI, glucagon
immunoreactivity (GI) and glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI)
were investigated in normals and diabetics. Konnyaku powder
tended to flatten the glucose tolerance curve more remarkably
compared to guar gum in diabetics. Changes in plasma IRI levels
were parallel to those in plasma glucose. There was no difference
in patterns of plasma GI and GLI response between OGTT and OGTT
with dietary fiber. Five diabetics, 4 obese MOD and one IDDM,
were given 18 g guar gum over a 4-week period while taking their
home diet. All patients but one IDDM showed a body weight loss of
1 to 3 kg during the period and their mean urinary glucose
excretion fell by 80%. </p>
<p>The long term effectiveness and adverse effects of the agents
were followed for more than one year in these and four newly
selected patients. The agent was similarily effective over the
long term period in all but two whose disease became refractory
to the regimen after several months but well controlled again by
its readministration following discontinuation for a few weeks.</p>
<p>One of them experienced the same episode twice. No remarkable
adverse effects were seen during the long term period. All
patients experienced alleviation of exaggerated postprandial
hunger sensation while taking the agent. The dietary fiber is
considered to represent a useful adjunct in the dietary therapy
of diabetics, particularly in obese maturity-onset diabetics also
in our country.</p>
