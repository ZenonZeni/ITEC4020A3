<p><em>Due to the length, this paper is presented in three parts:</em>

 <dd><em>Part II (this part)</em>
 <dd><em><A href="bateman3.html">Part III</a></em>

<h4>DEVELOPING THE IEP</h4>
<p>
The proper team has assembled, the student's photo is prominently placed, the
calming herbal tea has been served, the tape recorder is on and the newsprint
is on the easel. It is time to begin developing the IEP. A three-step IEP
development process is strongly recommended:

(a) List the student's unique characteristics or needs that require
individualization (and which entitle the student to individualized services);

(b) Determine and specify the district-provided services and modifications
that will appropriately address each need; and

(c) Write the goals and objectives that will be accomplished by the student if
the services and modifications are appropriate and effective.
<p>
An IEP "Non-Form" consisting solely of a blank piece of paper oriented
horizontally can accommodate this process far better than existing forms.
Divide the paper into thirds and label the three columns something like: (1)
Student's Needs; (2) Services; and (3) Evaluation of Services. Other headings
that work well are (a) Individualize because.....; (b) What the district will
do; (c) How we'll know it is working. 
<p>
<b>The Student's Unique Characteristics or Needs </b><br>
First, the IEP team must determine the student's unique characteristics or
needs to which the special services will be directed. One helpful way to learn 
to think in terms of these essential characteristics is to imagine that you
are describing the student to a volunteer who has never met the student and is
going to take him or her camping for a week. The IEP is required to address
only the portions or aspects of the student's education that needs to be
individualized. The student should be visible in the IEP. Too many IEPs reveal
only the academic program available in the resource room and show nothing
whatsoever about the student. The primary focus of the IEP is going to be the
specification of services. This initial step is to determine what is
necessitating the services.
<p>
If we complete the statement, "We are individualizing Johnny's program because
"_______" those "because" are his unique needs. The "because" may be such
things as: (a) he is reading several years behind where he should be; (b) he
is unable to organize his assignments, homework; or (c) his attention is too
easily distracted away from work, etc. These are the exact needs to be
addressed in the next column.
<p>
When a legal dispute arises about a student's program, a common concern is
whether the services provided addressed all the student's special needs. Those
special needs are what must be specified in this first stage of IEP
development. It is difficult to imagine how one could either attack or defend
the services offered to meet unique needs unless those needs had been
specified. In addition to the real world knowledge the IEP team members have
about the student's characteristics/needs, it may be helpful to consult any
current evaluations. This is particularly important for the first IEP which
immediately follows the evaluation which found the student to be IDEA
eligible. Some evaluations fail to address a student's special needs; others
can be very helpful.
<p>
Characteristics or needs will often "cluster." The team may well decide in the
next stage that one service will address more than one characteristic or need.
However, at this point it is important to just "brainstorm" and list all the
unique characteristics that require individualized attention. Sometimes the
natural flow seems to be to work "across" the IEP Non-Form, i.e., when a
characteristic has been identified, to then decide what service or
accommodation will address it and finally determine the goals and objectives
for that service that will indicate its appropriateness. Other times it may be
better to list all the characteristics first, then move to services and then
to goals. Either way, or a combination, is perfectly OK.
<p>
Examples of characteristics (not all from the same student) in both academic
and social-emotional-behavioral areas follow. Remember that for each, the next
inquiry will be, "What will the district do about this?" Some examples of
unique characteristics or needs in academic areas are:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) Handwriting that is slow, labored, "drawn," nearly illegible due to
improper size and spacing of letters and words;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) Lacks understanding of place value and regrouping in both addition and
subtraction;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) Attributes literal, concrete meaning to everything he hears and reads;
doesn't get jokes or slang;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) Understands spoken language, decodes words accurately, but does not
comprehend material read independently; oral reading reveals severe lack of
expression and no attention to punctuation;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e) Works very slowly, becomes upset if he makes a mistake, quits and refuses
to continue if paper is "messy",
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f) Answers before thinking, both in oral and written work; work is impulsive;
many "careless" errors; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g) Gets arithmetic problems `"messed up" and copies them incorrectly off
board and out of book. Lines up problems incorrectly and also lines up answers
wrong in multiplication and division.
<p>
The law requires that the Present Level of Performance (PLOP) in these areas
of need be indicated in a way that is readily understandable and is precise
enough to allow us to measure progress. The PLOP can appear either as an
elaboration of the characteristic or need or as the chronological beginning
point in a succession of PLOP, behavioral objectives, and annual goal. The
PLOP is now, the objectives are short-term goals, and the goal is where the
student is headed by the end of a year.
<p>
If the PLOP is treated as a quantification of the characteristic or need, then
a PLOP for the slow, barely legible handwriting in example (a) above might be
"copies 5 words per minute with 1 or 2 of the words illegible."
<p>
Some characteristics or needs are sufficiently descriptive as they are and
need no quantification, e.g., lacks understanding of place value and
regrouping. To say that the student performs zero regrouping problem;
correctly adds little to the description.
<p>
Sometimes a present level of performance can be best described by a work
sample. A picture can speak very loudly, as in a timed handwriting sample
which could be attached to the IEP as a PLOP. Such a sample can reveal both
quality (content) of written expression as well as mechanics of handwriting.
<p>
Some examples of unique characteristics or needs in social-emotional-
behavioral areas would be :
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) Shy; no friends; never volunteers in class; never initiates social contact
with other children;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) Bully; doesn't know how to play with other children; physically aggressive
with smaller children;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) Over-reacts and has temper outbursts; is noncompliant; pouts and whines;
is sullen and negative when suggestions are made; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) Short attention span; easily distracted by sounds.
<p>
These characteristics would be treated just the same as academic needs. A PLOP
would be added if necessary and then the team would ask what the district will
do about the bullying or the shyness or short attention span.
<p>
<b>The Special Education, Related Services and Modifications - the District
Will "Do's"</b><br>
The second inquiry the team should make is, "How will the district respond to
each of the student's needs? What will we do about Joe's need for help in
making friends? What will we do about Toni's tendency to work rapidly and
carelessly? What will we do about Manuel's anger problem?" The special
education, related services or modifications the district will provide can be
conveniently thought of as the "district do's." The "do's" are listed in the
middle column of the Non-Form. They may be as creative, flexible, innovative,
and often inexpensive as the team's brainstorming and combined wisdom allow.
This listing of services becomes the "Special Education and Related Services"
which the law requires be on the IEP and which is too often omitted or simply
perverted into a mere check mark or a percentage of time in special education.
The amount of related services such as speech therapy or physical therapy that
is needed must be shown, along with the date the service is to begin and the
anticipated duration of the service.
<p>
One of the interesting issues about services is the question of whether
methodology need be specified. If, for example, the service is remedial
reading, must the method be spelled out? In general the answer is "no".
In 1977, when the IDEA rules were first proposed, they would have mandated
that methodology and instructional materials were to be included in IEPs.
However, when the rules became final that requirement had been dropped, In the
meantime, some states and districts had moved quickly and already had forms
that included methods and materials. It is not unusual to find those forms
still in use. One disadvantage of including method is that so doing means an
IEP meeting would have to be called to change the method. If method isn't on
the IEP it can be changed unilaterally as the teacher sees fit.
<p>
Methodology becomes a source of conflict when parents are convinced their
child will receive benefit from a particular method and will not benefit from
the method the district wants to use. The most frequently sought methods are a
particular method of communication for students who are deaf and direct
instruction and/or phonics based reading programs for students who are
learning disabled. Almost all courts agree that schools may usually select the
method. However, in rare cases parents have been able to show that a
particular method is necessary to allow the IEP to be "reasonably calculated"
to allow benefit, e.g., <em>Hawaii Dept. of Education v. Tara H</em>., Civ.
No. 86-1161, (D.HI 1987). It is extremely important to note, as no court has
yet done, that when the U.S. Supreme Court said methodology should be left to
the state (school) it said so in the context of presuming the school had
expertise in all relevant, effective methods <em>Board of Ed. v. Rowley</em>,
102 S.Ct. 3034, (1982). This is not usually the case.
<p>
A common and interesting question related to these "District Do" services
relates to in-service training for teachers. Rob, e.g., has Tourette's
Syndrome and needs a teacher who is knowledgeable about how his involuntary
vocalizations are affected by stress. The agreed upon service to be provided
by the district is inservice training by the local physician for all the
school staff. Does that "district do" belong on Rob's IEP? Yes, it does. It is
a service to meet his unique need. One concern is that such a service doesn't
lend itself directly to a goal formulated in terms of Rob's behavior. This
concern is easily addressed by looking to what we hope to see in Rob's
behavior as a result of having an informed, sympathetic teacher who assists
him in avoiding unnecessary stress. One obvious answer is improved academic
performance. Other outcomes could be a direct decease in frequency and
severity of his symptoms and an increase in socialization.
<p>
Another issue is that the service is not being provided directly to Rob.
Legally, an important question is whether Rob is receiving some special
education, i.e., some specially designed instruction to meet his unique needs,
which is delivered by qualified special education personnel. If he is not
receiving any special education, as defined in the law, he is either not
eligible under IDEA or he is not receiving the free appropriate education to
which he is entitled. If he is receiving special education then it does not
matter how the in-service training for his teachers is conceptualized.
Logically, in-service staff training is perfectly analogous to parent training
and is, therefore, a related service. If so, it is important to specify, as
for all related services, how much in-service is to be provided and when.
<p>
For many years some districts resisted including on IEPs the modifications
needed in the regular classroom. However, it is well settled law that they
must be included. A checklist of types of modifications (e.g., in grading,
discipline, assignments, texts, tests, etc.) can be helpful to insure all
necessary modifications are addressed.
<p>
<b>The Present Levels of Performance, Goals and Objectives-Evaluating the
District "Do's"</b><br>
The third step, after the needs have been delineated and the services
specified, is to write the required annual goal and behavioral objectives for
each special education service or cluster of services. The clustering of
services can be very efficient as well as conceptually illuminating. For
example, think of a secondary student who has a severe learning disability
affecting his written expression. He might need several services including
keyboarding instruction, tutoring in writing, modifications in test-taking and
length of written assignments, substitution of oral presentations for some
term papers, and modified grading. The entire service cluster could be
reasonably evaluated in terms of his improved rates of successful course
completion and attendance.  Other goals could also be very appropriate. The
point is that just as characteristics or needs can be clustered to provide one
service, so services can be clustered to be assessed by a common, single goal.
<p>
Writing goals and objectives begins with asking, "If the service we are
providing is effective, what will we see in Todd's behavior that tells us so?"
The purpose of the mandated goals and objectives is to evaluate the service.
We need to know when or if to change what we're doing, to change the service
we are providing. As long as  we're on track and the child is making
reasonable progress we just keep going. That's why objectives are to be
statements of <em>how far</em> the student will progress toward the annual
goal (12 month objective) <em>by when</em>.
<p>
One of the common and major problems with goals and objectives is that they
are not taken seriously by their writers who have no intention of actually
checking whether the student has reached them or not. It is as if we never
understood the most basic tenet of the IEP, i.e., that we are going to try the
listed services and see <em>if they work</em> for that student. The goals and
objectives are to be <em>real</em>. They are to be used to evaluate program
effectiveness. They are not just legal requirements to be completed and filed.
The contrast can be seen easily.

<p>
<A NAME="ARef">One easy and effective way</a> to include the mandated present levels of
performance (PLOP) in the areas of concern is to use them as the beginning
point in a sequence going from the PLOP to the objectives to the annual goal.
This kind of sequence is illustrated in Joe's <a href="#NonformA">Non-Form IEP</a>. Joe is an
identified student with learning disabilities who was in the 9th grade in a
very small, rural district.
