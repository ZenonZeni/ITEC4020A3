<CENTER><H1>ICSI for Male Infertility</H1>
</CENTER><P><EM>ICSI (pronounced &quot;icksy&quot;)
</EM>stands for Intracytoplasmic
(&quot;intra-cyto-plasmic&quot;) Sperm Injection<EM>.
</EM></P>
<P>This is a truly revolutionary procedure that allows
couples with severe male factor infertility to establish a
biological pregnancy.</P>
<P>To perform ICSI, the wife undergoes a normal IVF (in
vitro fertilization) cycle. However, when it is time to
fertilize the eggs, instead of placing them in a petri dish
with the husband's semen and waiting for them to fertilize, a
special technique is followed:</P>
<P>A single sperm is drawn from the semen specimen into a
very thin-tipped pipette, and the tip of the pipette is then
inserted into the egg. The sperm is then released directly
into the egg.</P>
<P>Each egg harvested from the wife can be fertilized in
this manner, and thus several embryos can be returned to the
uterus, increasing the chances of pregnancy.</P>
