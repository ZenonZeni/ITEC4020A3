<PRE><STRONG><H3>The Plant Kingdom:</H3></STRONG>
     From  the  plant  kingdom you get humus. This comes  from  leaves,
grass  clippings, etc. Here are some sources from the plant  kingdom:   hay,
leaves,apple skins(ash), banana skins(ash), coffee grounds,  cottonseed
meal, peanut shells, pine needles,

<STRONG><H3>A word about Human Hair</H3></STRONG>
     Human hair contains nitrogen and other trace minerals. Because  of
the  amounts of chemicals used on hair these days at the beauty  parlor
the  hair  will not properly compost. Therefore use hair  from  a  men's
salon  instead  of  a woman's, as most men do not use these  chemicals.
Hair also takes too long to compost within 60 days and therefore should
be used in the sheet method described later.

<STRONG><H3>The Animal Kingdom</H3></STRONG>
     Obtain any or all if you can of: Cattle, chickens, horses, sheep,
llamas,  goats,  rabbits, and ducks. Best is aged at  least  4  months.
Trace  minerals  also come from various sources such as:Oyster  shells,
coffee  wastes, silica sand, bay crab meal, kelp meal,(hair is  a  good
source  of  trace  mineral but should be composted well  before  using)
(hoof and horn meal, bonemeal, and blood meal are all optional). Animal
manures are also rich in various trace minerals(always vary your manure
source).

<STRONG><H3>To Bin or not to Bin?</H3></STRONG>
     When  you  begin to take into consideration  what  you  have
available to work with, you will then have to decide whether to go the  bin
route  or  the pile route.  In short if you need a lot of compost  then
the piles are easier and faster then using bins. Bins on the other hand
work  fine for a person with a small garden/home. Three bins  min.  are
suggested. They should be at least 3ft by 5ft by 4ft high and  made  of
wood. There are many books available on making compost bins.

<STRONG><H3>Is it Rotting or Not?</H3></STRONG>
       If  it doesn't smell bad and looks good and dark like rich earth
then it's done!

<STRONG><H3>HINTS.</H3></STRONG>
           Heat  is  important in compost making. When making  bins  or
piles,  the  bigger  the  pile the more heat  it  will  be  capable  of
producing.  Too small a pile, and too much heat is lost. Bacteria  love
heat  and  work best within a range of 140-180 F. Too big a  pile  will
compress  the  material  too  tightly and  make  decomposition  a  slow
process. Also too much heat will kill off bacteria. 4 to 6 ft  tall  is
the  proper  height  for  a  compost pile. This  pile  will  shrink  as
composting takes place. This method can also be done during the  winter
time as the pile is big enough to generate its own heat. You monitor the
temp to make sure the pile heats up enough.

<STRONG><H3>About Nitrogen</H3></STRONG>
     A proper Carbon-Nitrogen ratio is important for proper composting.
Nitrogen is needed to help heat up the compost. Carbon is needed as the
fuel.  Adding natural sources of Nitrogen (in the form of alfalfa meal,
manure  or  any organically nitrogen rich material) will  increase  its
energy  level, allowing for great activity of  the  bacteria  present.
Moisture  is  important in the composting process, but it must  not  be
soggy.  I would not concern myself with this ratio; just work with  what
you  have, keeping in mind the balance required to make the compost pile
work  right. The ratio will come out just right if you apply  a  little
bit from each kingdom as mentioned above.
