<h2>The Greening of YellowStone Workshop</h2>
<h3>Great Ideas for the Next 125 Years for the Park and the Region</h3>

Yellowstone National Park, which will celebrate its 125th anniversary
in 1997, supports local tourism economies of its gateway communities
in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho.  Preservation of the environmental
quality of the Park is vitally important to the economic development
of the surrounding region.  The Greening of Yellowstone Workshop
is intended to develop and foster environmentally-favorable practices
in Yellowstone National Park through the promotion of  partnerships
among local communities; State and Federal economic development,
energy, and environmental agencies; private industry; and national
and regional experts.  The Workshop will encourage participants
to embrace a shared vision for sustainability of the Park's
future and to develop solutions that will help the region continue
to balance the protection of Park resources and economic viability
while maintaining visitor use and enjoyment.  
<P>
The workshop was held in West Yellowstone, Montana October 15-18,
1996.  Participants considered a wide range of sustainable strategies
and products, including a possible regional composting facility,
alternate fuel vehicles, replacement of toxic solvents and cleaning
products, and modification to a more environmentally-friendly
energy infrastructure.  Participants were divided into small topic
groups to accomplish Workshop goals.  Topic groups addressed increased
recreational demands on the Park and developed possible solutions
to ensure the long term economic and environmental health of this
region.   The topic groups were: 
<P>
<B><LI>Energy Infrastructure and Alternatives</B>:  This group
focused on sustainable energy infrastructure in the park and region
and developed initiatives to reduce the amount of pollution produced
through energy production and use.  Approaches included:  the
use of alternative fuels and lubricants such as those derived
from biomass; implementation of conservation measures; and the
use of "green" utility services, photovoltaics, and
other sustainable sources or technologies.  Attention was given
to winter energy use in buildings and over-snow transportation.
<P>
<B><LI>Building Materials and Design:  </B>This group concentrated
on environmentally-friendly designs and on building materials
that are indigenous, recycled, biodegradable, sustainable, and
less toxic than conventional materials.
<P>
<B><LI>Cleaner Products/Better Practices:  </B>This group focused
on the use of environmentally friendly products in park operations,
homes, businesses, and local governments and on better agricultural
practices to reduce impacts on the environment.  Attention was
given to reducing the load at wastewater treatment facilities
and addressing surface water runoff and groundwater impacts from
non-point sources.  These practices would also improve land and
air quality.  Discussions included economic advantages of cleaner,
more efficient activities.
<P>
<B><LI>Transportation Systems and Means:  </B>The transportation
group considered alternative fuel vehicles such as buses fueled
with biodiesel or liquefied natural gas, vans powered with fuel
cells, and vehicles operating on ethanol, biodiesel, or electricity.
 The group also discussed transportation infrastructure, including
alternative modes of transportation, traffic congestion, alternate
parking pricing, traffic calming, and the promotion of rural highways
systems for more efficient and less polluting travel.  
<P>
<B><LI>Waste Management, Recycling and Reuse</B>:  The Waste
Management group focused on composting, recycling, and other disposal
topics.
