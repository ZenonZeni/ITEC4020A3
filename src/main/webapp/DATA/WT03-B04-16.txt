CANADA
POLITICS

As the dust began to settle over the province of Quebec's
late-October referendum decision to remain within Canada, the leader
of the seperatist Bloc Quebecois (BQ), Lucien Bouchard, announced his
decision to quit federal politics in favor of taking over the
premiership of the province from Jaques Parizeau.

It was Parizeau who led the BQ's provincial sister party, the Party
Quibicois (PQ), to victory in the provincial elections in 1994.
Parizeau resigned following the narrow defeat sustained by the PQ in
the referendum on independence.

In announcing his decision, Bouchard that while he would await
constitutional offers from the federal government aimed at keeping
Quebec within the federation, he expects that any such proposals will
prove inadequate.  As a result of that, Bouchard said that he will be
likely to call another referendum, but that it would not take place
before April 1997.  He went on to predict that the next referendum
would result in success for Quebec's seperatist movement.  While the
accuracy of that prediction remains to be seen, it is true to say
that Bouchard's dynamic entry into the debate over separatism in the
run-up to the last referendum was largely responsible for the near
victory achieved by the PQ then.  With Bouchard at the helm
throughout, the possibility of a sovereign Quebec before the turn of
the millennium cannot be ruled out.

Meanwhile, Bouchard's major opponent during the Quebec affair,
Federal Prime Minister Jean Chritien, has come in for severe
criticism from within the country's ruling Liberal Party for his
handling of the issue.  Prior to the referendum, Chritien had assured
anglophone Canadians that there was nothing to worry about in Quibic
and that the province would not be leaving the federation as a result
of the referendum because the separatists had no chance of winning
it.  As it turns out, the separatists came within a whisker.  The
last week of campaigning saw Chritiin back-pedaling furiously to
offer several concessions to the seperatists in order to prevent a
government defeat.

Now that the federalists' panic has receded, the whispering campaign
has begun.  Reports suggest that some within Chritien's party feel
that he is no longer the best man to ensure that Quibec remains
within the federation.  With Bouchard in place as the province's
premier as of the beginning of 1996, this feeling may well increase
to proportions at which Chritien's 31 year-old career in politics
could be threatened.

CANADA
ECONOMY

The latest OECD report on Canada suggests that, while the economy is
likely to see some degree of recovery during 1996, high levels of
provincial and federal debt will continue to present considerable
problems to the country's ability to weather any further economic
downturn, and may result in greater volatility of the Canadian
dollar.

Real GDP growth is estimated to rise by 3.1% in 1996, with the bulk
of growth coming from a 4.5% expansion in the second half of the
year.  The organization sees this growth coming as a result of a
broadening of the base of economic activity from the largely
export-led recovery that has been seen to date.  Despite an expected
increase in the levels of private consumption and housing as a result
of wage increases  in the export sector, widespread wage increases
are not expected, keeping down the magnitude of such private
consumption rises.  Public sector consumption spending is expected,
and hoped, to remain weak as commitment to fiscal austerity
continues.  Inflation is forecast to be around the middle of the Bank
of Canada's target range of 1-3%.

Canada's ratio of public sector debt to GDP now stands at some 65%,
with interest payments exceeding government deficits.

CHILE
POLITICS

Former dictator, Augusto Pinochet celebrated his 80th birthday at the
end of November and signaled his determination to remain at the
center of Chilean politics until his constitutional term as commander
of the army expires in 1998.  Pinochet's remarks will not have been
lost on President Eduardo Frei, who has attempted to challenge the
"constitutional safeguards" put in place by Pinochet when he handed
over government to civilian rule after the 1989 election of Patricio
Aylwin Azocar.

Under the arrangements that Pinochet made, both he, and nine military
appointed Senators remain in place until 1998.  Frei wants
desperately to get rid of them because his ruling coalition is three
seats short of a majority in the upper House.  Doubtless Frei would
also like to see an end to the need to spend some 39% of the public
sector wage bill, equivalent to 2.8% of GDP on the armed forces.
Another of Pinochet's parting gifts was to ensure that legislation
was passed that meant that no one could interfere with the military's
budget.

In addition to his comments about staying on to what may well be a
bitter end in terms of his relationship with Frei, Pinochet has been
explaining that his 17 years in power were a "soft" dictatorship.  He
went on to defend officers of his regime who are now in prison for
human rights' abuses and suggested that they had been imprisoned
despite any proof of wrong-doing.  One cannot help but wonder how
such comments were received by the families of those hundreds of
people who disappeared under the former dictator's regime and will
never see an eightieth birthday.

They will at least have been cheered to hear that former torture
chief, Manuel Contreras, who was convicted of murder in June, has
recovered from the hernia that had made him so poorly that he had to
be detained in a Naval hospital.  In a move that Frei himself will
doubtless applaud, Contreras' recovery has resulted in him finally
being able to be transferred to prison to serve his sentence.  In a
last ditch attempt at avoiding such a fate and a final display of his
boundless bravery, Contreras, who is believed to have been
responsible for the torture and murder of many of those who
disappeared, staged a hunger strike in October.  It lasted two days.

CHILE
ECONOMY

After an initial delay in September, Codelco, the state-owned copper
corporation has announced that it is to go ahead with its plans for
the development of a fifth mine.  Radomiro Tomic will add will come
on stream in 1999 and add an initial 150,000 tonnes of copper a year
to the country's output.  Expansion to 225,000 tonnes is expected to
be swift, bringing Codelco's total output to 1.4 million tonnes by
the end of the decade.

The investment needed to develop the mine is estimated at some US$641
million and will be financed out of company cash flow, according to
Codelco's executive vice-president, Juan Villarzu.  The new venture
makes it highly unlikely that Codelco will go the way of other
parastatals in being privatized for the foreseeable future, and will
prove something of an acid test for the company in its attempts to
show that it can be as efficient and profitable as a privately owned
company.

NAFTA
With the US budget battle making it increasingly unlikely that
Chile's application for fast track entry into the North American Free
Trade Agreement will pass through the US legislature before it breaks
in mid-December, Canada and Mexico have indicated a willingness to
extend trade agreements of an equivalent nature to Chile in the
meantime.

The possibility of such a "bridging" arrangement should, according to
Canadian Trade Minister, Roy McLaren, be discussed by the three
countries in the near future.  Should such discussions prove
fruitful, Chile could see the arrangements come into force by
mid-1996.

COSTA RICA
POLITICS

The high levels of consensus that have traditionally marked Cost
Rican politics are beginning to wane as popularity for the government
of President Figueres and his National Liberation Party (PLN) has
fallen sharply.

Figueres and the PLN are approaching the mid point of their term in
office, which began in early 1994 when, in another almost
traditionally Costa Rican result, the incumbent Social Christian
Unity Party (PUSC) led by Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier were removed
from office.  Figueres and the PLN ran on a platform of blaming the
PUSC for implementing free market economic reforms that resulted in
higher unemployment and a host of other social problems.

Despite Figueres' stated opposition to free market policies and
IMF-sponsored structural adjustment programs, the recent decline in
what has been one of the region's richest economies has led him to
accept the need for reform.  This has been further underlined by the
country's high level of debt.  At an estimated US$4 billion, foreign
debt is equivalent to nearly 60% GDP and generates  a debt service
ratio of some 17%.  Internally, the PLN inherited a fiscal deficit of
8% from its predecessors.  Attempts to blame the outgoing Calderon
administration for the poor state of the country's finances, while
reasonably correct, have done little to calm the ire of the Costa
Rican people as the austerity measures put in place by the PLN have
bitten hard.

The hardships being faced by the population resulted in a wave of
strikes throughout 1995.  Public sector unions exercise considerable
strength within the political system of Costa Rica and such public
shows of dissent have, in the past, often resulted in changes in
government policy irrespective of which party has been in power.

It would seem that this is no longer the case, however.  Some 50,000
Costa Rican teachers held a month long strike toward the end of 1995,
denouncing both the government and the opposition for the handling of
economic policy and in particular the public sector layoffs that have
occurred and the increases in basic utility charges that have been
introduced.

Traditionally supporters of the NLP, the teachers have accused the
government of failing to meet its campaign pledges and has said that
the PLN now lacks credibility.  Unfortunately for the teachers, the
chances of a government turnaround appear slim.  The economic reforms
being put in place by the PLN are an integral part of the IMF standby
agreement sought by the government as part of the process of putting
the country's economic house in order.  The situation is likely to
get worse before it gets better.

CUBA
POLITICS

Determined to circumvent the efforts of some sections of the US
legislature to destroy the economy of his comparatively tiny country,
President Castro has been busy courting a wide variety of partners
for trade and cooperation during the last couple of months of 1995.
Increasingly it seems to be the USA rather than Cuba that is being
viewed as intransigent and unreasonable.

Perhaps in final recognition that a large section of the
international community looks none too kindly on the US stance on
Cuba, the American Senate passed a considerably watered-down version
of the Helms bill aimed at tightening the US embargo at the end of
October.  It was not watery enough, however, to prevent the passage
of a UN General Assembly resolution at the beginning of November
calling for an end to the US economic embargo.

Despite the resolution, some members of the US lower House are still
hoping to reintroduce some of the stiffer measures ditched by the
Senate when the two bills come up for reconciliation.  But with
Castro enjoying cordial relations in so many other places at present,
the effects of any such moves might well have been neutralized before
they can take place.

Meetings between Castro and the representatives of several other
countries including South Africa, Uruguay, Vietnam and Mongolia have
taken place recently.  All reported to have gone well and resulted
either in the signing of cooperation and/or trade agreements or have
gone some way toward such agreements.

In addition, Cuba and Russia have concluded a series of protocols
which the two countries describe as amounting to a new stage in trade
and financial relations between them.  Russia has agreed to a sugar
for oil deal which will ensure that what Castro has described as the
"Achilles' heel" of the Cuban economy will be protected to the tune
of 4.5 million tonnes of oil in return for 1.5 tonnes of sugar.  With
world sugar production expected to top the 120 million tonne mark for
the first time in 1995/96, Castro will be particularly satisfied to
have arranged a deal that takes Cuban sugar out of a potentially
falling market.

It should, however, be noted that neither country has yet completed
delivery of 1995's barter deal, which involved one million tons of
sugar for three million tons of oil.  Should things not work out,
however, a further source of oil is likely to be Angola, with whom
Cuba signed a cooperation accord at the end of October

In addition to the sugar deal, Russia has promised to give Cuba
enough money and technology to finish building a Soviet-era nuclear
reactor in the country.  Reportedly, Russia is to provide US$349
million and Cuba US$208 million towards the project.  A further
US$200 million is to be raised from an international consortium
including Latin American and Western countries.  Of the Latin
American contingent, Brazil will almost certainly be a part.  Recent
discussions between the two countries are believed to be likely to
result in the signing of a nuclear cooperation pact in the near
future.

Other recent negotiations have resulted in an investment agreement
being signed with Vietnam, the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Kenya and a deal in which Colombia has agreed to purchase
vaccines from Cuba.
Still more negotiations took place in November between Cuba and the
European Union (EU).  According to the EU these have a good chance of
leading to the signing of an economic and trade agreement, provided
that Castro is willing to accept some form of transition to
democracy.  So far, however, the Havana regime appears
unenthusiastic.  Alongside increased confidence of an economic
recovery in 1996, Castro's preparedness to spurn the double-handed
approach of the EU is perhaps as a result of a warming of relations
between Havana and Beijing.

The Cuban President made a reportedly highly successful trip to
China, again in November.  The visit coincided, strangely enough,
with a six day visit by general secretary of the Communist Party of
Vietnam.  Neither Cuba nor Vietnam have had particularly cordial
relations with China in the past, but the shrinking world of
communism seems to be uniting former adversaries in a struggle for
survival.

In his state of the nation speech in July last year, Castro said that
while he was prepared to go some way toward capitalism in order to
reform his country, he had no intention of giving up his ideology.
His visit to China has been seen as an exercise in learning how the
two may be combined.  While the discussions that took place in
Beijing remain largely unknown, the Chinese foreign ministry did say
that at wide range of bilateral issues were be dealt with and that
particular emphasis will be given to economic development.  The
possibility of a trilateral agreement between Cuba , China and
Vietnam was, however, ruled out.

CUBA
FINANCE

Much of Castro's confidence in dealing with the international
community stems from the fact that, despite all the odds being
stacked against it, the Cuban economy continues to grow.  Latest
figures released by the Planning Ministry suggest that GDP growth in
1995 will reach 2.5%, a significant advance on the 0.7% growth
recorded in 1994.

In a move aimed at re-starting talks with western creditors, the
government has released an astoundingly detailed report on the
country and its debt.  The report puts total debt at US$9.1 billion
at the end of 1994 and for the first time publishes balance of
payments' figures using IMF-recommended methods.  The data, which had
been specifically requested by creditors, shows an improvement in the
current account deficit from US$371.6 million in 1993 to US$81.3
million in 1994.  The decline in deficit is attributed to an increase
in exports and a rise in net current transfers, mostly from donations
and remittances from Cubans living abroad.

Cuba's parlous financial state means that it badly needs to gain
access to the medium and long term debt arrangements that have been
denied it since debt talks with the Paris Club of international
creditors stalled in 1986.  The release of this latest economic
report is the first step along that road, but there is still some
considerable distance to go.  The journey will be made that much more
difficult by the fact that Cuba is not a member of the IMF and the
chances of the USA allowing it to rejoin are slim.

In the meantime, not to be outdone, Castro has told the people of
Cuba that the "capitalist evil" of income tax will be falling upon
them again as of January 1996.  For the time being the tax will be
payable on hard currency earnings only, but the writing is on the
wall for taxation of the relatively low national state salaries.

In a further move aimed at easing the country's financial problems,
two more foreign banks, France's Societe Generale and Banco Sabadell
of Spain, have been authorized to open branches in Cuba.  These two
bring to 11 the number of foreign banks that have been granted
licenses to operate in Cuba over the last few months.

Credit and loan agreements have been signed with several of the
foreign banks now represented in the country and, although figures
have not been released, it is believed that the deals involve
financing for Cuba's sugar, nickel and rice production and for food
imports.

EL SALVADOR
POLITICS

Despite recent attempts by President Calderon, to assure the people
of El Salvador that all is well and a life of prosperity and laughter
awaits them, tanks took to the streets in November amid large scale
demonstrations and rumors of a military coup attempt.

Members of the National Civilian Police used rubber bullets and tear
gas to bring to an end a siege when former soldiers of the Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front (FLMN) occupied a building in the capital, San
Salvador.  The protesting soldiers held the inhabitants hostage for
three hours, demanding that the government fulfill the promises it
made under the Chapultepec peace agreement concerning job training
and the granting of loans.  This was the latest in a series of
demonstrations carried out by demobilized fighters demanding help
with their reintegration into society.

The incident, in which one of the former soldiers was killed, gave
rise to persistent rumors of an imminent coup attempt as armored
vehicles, troops and helicopters reportedly took up positions around
the city.  However, the threat of a coup was dismissed by Calderon,
who said that the rumors were of a plot to destabilize the country,
hatched by the FMLN and the working classes.  According to the
government, evidence of the plot had been uncovered and the heads of
metropolitan riot police and mobile units were given details in a
special memorandum.

The memorandum, which apparently details several planned activities
by labor organizations aimed at "paralyzing the country and provoking
insurrection", was condemned by FMLN leader, Leonel Gonzalez, as
untrue.  According to Gonzalez, the army and PNC intelligence
services are deliberately creating an atmosphere of mistrust in the
country in order that the government can justifiably carry out a
security clampdown to stifle opposition to its widely disliked
economic program.

However, FMLN deputy, Miguel Saenz Varela has suggested that the
military maneuvers were indeed indicative of a coup attempt in the
making.  According to Saenz, it is not the government seeking to
clamp down on its opposition that has resulted in the increased
tensions within the country, but unidentified forces who are intent
on discrediting the transition to democracy.

For its part, the army refutes suggestions it would be party to any
coup attempt.  Defense Minister General Humberto Corado said that the
military regretted the death that had accompanied the PNC action
against the former soldiers, but pointed out that the overriding
priority for authorities was the restoration of order.  Without that,
said Corado, "regretful consequences for the country" might ensue.
The deafeningly loud unspoken message seemed to be that such
regretful consequences would of course be avoided were the army to
establish military rule.

Despite Corado's insistence that that is not the army's aim, his
explanation of the military presence in the capital, which included
the "buzzing" of the Presidential Palace, seems a little thin.  He
claims the soldiers were there as part of a military sporting event.
He offered no explanation as to why those who, presumably, should
either have been spectators or competitors, were driving armored
trucks through the streets of San Salvador.  Given that no coup has
yet taken place, however,  it is perhaps reasonable to assume that
any, purely coincidental, messages that were given by the military's
actions have been taken on board by Calderon.

GUATEMALA
POLITICS

The people of Guatemala went to the polls on November 12 to elect a
new president from a field of no less than nineteen hopefuls.
Polling was said to have taken place without incident as guerrillas
of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) made good on
their promise of a unilateral two week cease-fire in order to allow
the election process to take place undisturbed.

In a somewhat rare show of reliability, opinion poll ratings that put
Alvaro Arzu of the right-wing National Advancement Party (PAN) and
Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front Party (FRG) as
the two front runners were proved correct.

Arzu, a popular former mayor of Guatemala City who comes from a
wealthy family and is heavily pro-business, took 36.5% of the vote.
Portillo, running as the front-man for FRG leader Efrain Rios Montt,
came in second with 22.1%.  The remainder of the vote was divided
amongst the confusing array of candidates that had never really stood
much chance.  These included a former defense minister who had been
found guilty of human rights abuses by a US court and an former
attorney-general who was remanded in custody under the last
government for swindling his aunt.

Despite winning the poll, Azru failed to gain the 50% of the vote
necessary to avoid a rerun.  This has been scheduled for January 7.
The likelihood is that Azru will be successful on that occasion.
While Portillo is a fellow conservative, he suffers from a degree of
guilt by association in that Montt is barred from standing in his own
right because of his 17 month long de facto rule in 1982-83.  That
period has been described by some as one of the most brutal periods
of Guatemalan history.

The relatively low turnout, at just 40% of the 3.7 million eligible
to vote was blamed in part on the large number of candidates causing
confusion amongst the electorate.  Hopefully, with the field a little
clearer for the January poll, there will be an increased interest in
what is only the country's third presidential election since it
gained independence in 1986.

At the time of this report, no agreement has been reached with the
URNG concerning an additional cease-fire to cover the run-off
election.  Despite pleas to extend the cease-fire past the November
13 cutoff, the URNG refused.  The guerrilla organization did,
however, say that it was ready to negotiate a permanent bilateral
truce with the government and that its commitment to achieving that
end was proven by the peaceful election period.  The organization has
said that it supports neither candidate in the run-off, but there is
little likelihood of disruption to voting.

The transitional government of current President Ramiro de Leon
Carpio will leave office on January 14 when the winner of the run-off
will take over for a four year term.

MEXICO
POLITICS

The problems being experienced by the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the wake of the late 1994 devaluation
crisis were underlined once again in October when Manuel Camacho,
former Mayor of Mexico City and once-upon-a-time likely candidate to
succeed President Zedillo, resigned from the party.

In explaining his resignation, Camacho said that he was not in favor
of cosmetic electoral reform intended to artificially prolong the
PRI's time in office.  Rather, said Camacho, he is interested in real
political change and the advancement of democracy.  He intends to
form a new coalition to achieve this out of what he sees as the
disaffected groups within both the PRI and the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD).

How successful he will be remains to be seen.  Despite suffering
severe criticism and several high profile gubernatorial election
defeats since the devaluation crisis, the PRI is still a fairly
cohesive unit.  The party responded to its poor electoral showings by
making several personnel changes in August 1995 in an attempt to
revitalize grassroots support.  Recent elections at the municipal
level suggest that while a resurgence in PRI support has not yet
arrived, the rot has perhaps been stopped.  While it is true to say
that the PRI is struggling to become more of a political party and
less of a tool of the President, it is not currently likely to break
down to the extent that would be necessary for Camacho to create a
realistic alternative.

The PRI does suffer from the fact that it has, in the past, been held
together more by power and patronage than by a common ideology.  This
has been underlined by the, almost meteoric, rise in popularity of
the National Action Party (PAN).  In common with many left-wing
parties over the last couple of years, the PRD has suffered something
of an identity crisis which has translated itself into poor electoral
results and caused a deal of internal division for the party.  The
lack of ideological direction on the part of the PRI has led a
fundamentally conservative electorate to move to the right, and into
the waiting arms of the PAN.  The PAN's capitalization on the right
wing mood of the population has further consolidated its ideological
position.  The PRD has seen its support dwindle, but it appears that
the party has rallied round its leaders in spite of the tensions that
this has brought.

Given that both the PRI and the PRD seem to be wrestling with their
problems but staying pretty much together, and that the popular
ground is being seized by the PAN, it is difficult to see just where
Camacho might find room to form a power base.  It is the PAN that has
stolen the governorships from the PRI and the likelihood is that,
come the congressional elections in 1997, it will be the PAN that
presents to biggest problem for the PRI.  How well the PRI stands up
to the challenge will depend, in large part, on how successful it is
in remodeling itself into a modern political party in the meantime.

MEXICO
ECONOMY

The government launched its Alliance for Economic Recovery at the
beginning of November in a bid to aid recovery and provide leeway for
increased social and investment spending while remaining within its
target of a balanced budget for 1996.

Under the plan, which was reached in conjunction with trade union and
business leaders, the minimum wage will be increased by 21% in two
installments.  The first took place in December 1995 and the second
is due in April this year.  In addition to the wage increase, higher
grants are to be given to the unemployed and further help will be
provided for the temporary jobs program.  Businesses will receive tax
incentives including a commitment to suspend asset taxes for small
and medium-sized business during 1996.  Tax on investment that is
over and above 1995 levels will be waived and tax credits will be
given to companies that take on new workers.

The government has also undertaken to help in the drive toward fiscal
stability by staggering price increases for gas and electricity, both
of which are still currently sold by parastatals.  The government
intends to make a 4.75% cut in real spending during 1996 and is
banking on the increased economic activity that will come as a result
of the Alliance providing the rise in tax revenues necessary to make
additional social spending measures feasible.

The plan has had a mixed reception with some economists worried about
the reliance on growth to ensure increased tax receipts.  According
to Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, the measures will mean a fiscal
relaxation of about 0.5% GDP which will not be enough to push the
government off its balanced budget target.  The plan is aimed at an
inflation rate on the year of 20% and growth of 3% of GDP.  Ortiz is
of the opinion that recovery will be export led and that this sector
will provide growth of 1.4 percentage points.  Given that the
government expects an export volume growth of 12% and a value growth
of 18% in US dollar terms, the peso is expected to strengthen.  No
figures for such a strengthening have been released, however.  The
government has simply said that the floating rate will continue.

Confidence in the currency's ability to achieve additional value and
survive a floating exchange rate system got off to a poor start.  The
peso plunged to its lowest ever level against the US dollar just
seven days after the government announced the Alliance.  A ten point
interest rate rise did nothing to strengthen the currency as it came
under increased pressure from speculators and the Central Bank was
force to intervene several times to defend it.  Even then, such
defense was unable to stop the currency losing close to one fifth of
its value against the US dollar in the space of two weeks.

Further distressing news for the government came toward the end of
November with figures being released that suggest that the Mexican
economy is continuing to contract at a worrying rate.  According to
the figures, GDP fell by 9.6% in the third quarter of 1995 compared
to 1994.  This followed a second quarter decline of 10.5%.  The
figures suggest that the government's estimate of a 5.5% contraction
for 1995 may prove to be optimistic.  Should that be the case, the
target figure for next year's recovery may slip beyond reach.

NICARAGUA
FINANCE

Finance Minister, Emilio Pereira, has announced that Nicaragua has no
chance of meeting its 1995 targets for an Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) operating under the IMF's stopgap loan
program.

The first of these targets was a reduction of the deficit in net
international reserves that was adjusted up to US$21,6 million.  Up
to October this year, however, these reserves were in deficit to the
tune of US$115.2 million.  According to Pereira, the situation is
better than it was last year, but he recognizes that the continuing
deficit in international reserves threatens the country's
macroeconomic stability.  The reason for the lack of progress in this
area is, according to Pereira, due to unspecified problems with the
Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute (Telcor).

Another indicator that the government will not be able to meet the
stopgap loan agreements is the fact that the net internal credit to
the non-financial public sector was not to exceed Nc308.4 million by
December 31.  However, reports issued by the Economic Studies
Management of the Central Bank registered credits to this sector of
Nc748.3 million up to November 9.  This put the government Nc439.9
million off target with more than a month to go to the deadline.

Finally, the National Development Bank was supposed to deposit US$30
million a month into the Central Bank from October.  The US$60
million that should, therefore, have arrived by the end of November
failed to do so.

The fact that these three goals have not been met makes it likely,
according to Pereira, that the IMF will withdraw its help at the

PANAMA
POLITICS

The prospect of a continued US military presence in Panama after 1999
looks less certain after the postponement of talks between the two
countries aimed at coming to an agreement over the terms of an
extension.

Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed during former US president
Jimmy Carter's term of office, the US presence that the Hay-Buneau
Varilla Treaty granted in perpetuity in 1903 must come to an end in
the year 2000.  Talks aimed at an extension of this period began in
September 1995.  There was immediate confusion as to which side had
initiated the talks.  Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
insisted that it was the USA that broached the subject, but this is
widely believed to have been a face-saving exercise on his part as
pressure began to build over the imminent loss of one of the major
planks in the Panamanian economy.

Balladares has explained the postponement in terms of it being a bad
time for the USA to deal with the issue given the problems it is
having over the budget.  This again, however, is likely to be less
than the whole story.  In reality, it is more likely that Balladares
has asked for far too much of what he terms "clear economic benefits"
for Panama that are the prerequisite for him considering a continued
foreign military presence in his country.

Opinion polls suggest that 75% of Panamanians want the US troops to
stay.  The US military presence pumps around US$400 million into the
country's tiny economy each year and supports some 18,000 jobs.
Official unemployment is at 14% but the true figure is probably
double that.  In addition, the country's traditional sources of
income have come under threat over recent years.  Once a thriving
offshore banking center, international insistence that rules be
tightened to stem the flow of dirty money being laundered in the
country have put paid to much of that sector.  Meanwhile,
deregulation in the USA has damaged Panama's erstwhile equally
successful shipping and insurance sectors, while the entry of Sweden,
Finland and Austria into the European Union's controlled banana
market has reduced exports of what was the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner by 20% this year.  Balladares is not really in a
position to demand rent from the USA in return for allowing it to
continue to prop up the economy, but it would appear that demand it
he has.

In fairness, it is understandable that Balladares should want a
better deal for Panama.  It was, after all the USA which, first
through sanctions and then through its invasion to remove former
dictator Manuel Noriega, devastated the economy in the first place.
Estimates put the real cost to Panama at US$4-6 billion.  US economic
aid since the 1989 invasion totals a mere US$700 million in
comparison, and the situation has not been helped by Panamanian banks
losing a further US$2 billion during the Mexican devaluation crisis
of 1994.

However, there is a good chance that talks will resume and that some
compromise will be made because Panama has the Canal and that is of
considerable strategic importance to the USA.  About 13,000 ships use
the Canal each year and this figure is growing at an annual 2%.  With
President Clinton pushing for even greater levels of free trade
within the Americas, that figure is set to rise over the next decade.
Given that, the USA will almost certainly be back to talk to
Balladares, but for the meantime, it would appear that he has
overstepped the mark and the US administration has decided to give
him a little time to reflect on his country's situation.

JANUARY 1996

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
POLITICS

It would not be entirely undeserved for President Bill Clinton to
allow himself a smile of satisfaction in the privacy of the Oval
office over the events of the last two months.  He has received a
considerable boost to his opinion poll ratings ahead of next year's
presidential election; he is not, again according to latest opinion
poll results, being held responsible for the increasingly
dangerous-looking budget battle; He has brokered possibly the most
important peace deal in Europe since the end of the Second World War;
and secured an advance in the peace talks in Northern Ireland.  And,
last but not least, the only man who has so far looked remotely
likely to present a challenge to his continuation in office next year
has decided not to run for the Republican presidential nomination.

That is not, however, to say that problems do not remain.  Most
pressing of these is the battle between Clinton and the Republican
party over the 1996 budget and extension of the current federal debt
ceiling of US$4,900 billion.

A late November compromise between the protaganists has ensured that
government funding continued until mid-December, but it is
essentially superficial and agreement on the real issues that lie
behind opposing spending suggestions remains some way off.  Tension
over the budget stand-off increased substantially in mid-November
when some 800,000 federal employees were sent home.  This came as a
result of the failure of the two sides to reach agreement on a
compromise over the passage of appropriations bills, which contain
Republican spending cuts, to areas that Clinton is determined to
protect.  Visitors choosing to see the sights had picked a bad day,
as both the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty were closed to the
public.  Rather more importantly, staff responsible for ensuring the
payment of pensions and some other state benefits were laid off,
leaving many Americans in difficult financial circumstances.

In order to ease the situation, Clinton did sign some appropriations
bills for individual departments.  This resulted in some government
workers returning to their posts, but did nothing to end the impasse
over the "reconciliation" bill passed by the House of
Representatives.  That bill includes some US$245 billion in tax cuts
and reforms of the social security net, both of which Clinton
continues to refuse to sign.

The compromise that gave rise to a continuation of government funding
for all departments until December 15 was reached when Clinton agreed
to the signing of a non-binding Congressional resolution that the
federal budget be balanced by 2002.  This seven year period for the
removal of the budget deficit has been the central feature of
Republican budget proposals.  Clinton's apparent climb-down from his
earlier suggestion of a 10 year period for balancing the budget was,
in fact, something of a non-move in that the depth of cuts required
to achieve the seven year target depend quite heavily on which
economic growth figures for the period are used.  Congress insists on
using projections made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and
their spending cuts rely on these figures.  The Clinton
administration, however, has its own set of figures that are less
pessimistic than those of the CBO, and would, as a result, require
less damaging cuts than those proposed by the Republicans.

The agreement made by Clinton does not, however, give the last word
on these projections to the CBO.  Rather, Clinton has said that he is
prepared to balance the budget over seven years, but only in
conjunction with figures resulting from an administration and private
sector review of the CBO projections.  Given the 4.2% growth in GNP
in the last quarter of 1995, the projections resulting from such a
joint enterprise are likely to be a deal more optimistic than those
currently available from the CBO.  The difference is of great
importance in that some estimates suggest that it could result in a
reduction in planned Republican spending cuts of hundreds of billions
of dollars over the forecast period.

Further to that, the text of the agreement quite clearly includes
provision for the "protection of future generations" by means of
ensuring the solvency of Medicare, the adequate funding of Medicaid
and the promotion of "tax policies for the working poor".  This
latter is a reference to the Earned Income Tax Credit system which
Republicans want to get rid of.  Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker in
the Lower House and architect of the Republican spending cuts has
accepted that the agreement puts the centerpiece US$245 billion tax
cut policy very much back on the negotiating table.

Meanwhile, attempts to overcome the impasse over the raising of the
federal debt ceiling before the USA defaults on its international
obligations have met with less success.  This is the other area in
which Republicans have attempted to link, to Clinton, unpalatable
legislation to the debt extension bill in order to force through
their wishes.  Crisis was averted in November when Treasury
Secretary, Robert Rubin, converted US$61.3 billion worth of
non-marketable treasury bonds into cash and auctioned a further US$48
billion worth of Treasury bills in order to cover the US$102 billion
worth of debt that came due.  This situation cannot go on forever,
however.  Rubin remains confident that the Treasury can get through
December by such methods, but crunch time will arrive in mid-January.

The political fallout from these issues looks to be landing squarely
on the Republicans at present.  Opinion polls suggest that twice as
many Americans support Clinton's refusal to bow to Republican
pressure than disagree with it.

This is just one more indicator of the problems being faced by a
Republican party that seems increasingly to be wide of the mark of
public opinion.  Following the decision of General Colin Powell not
to stand for the Republican presidential nomination, the party looked
toward Gingrich as a possible candidate to consolidate the image of a
floundering opposition.  He too, however, has declined such
invitations.  Given his plummeting popularity ratings over the last
few weeks, the Republican party might now breathe a sigh of relief
that he has chosen not to spearhead their presidential bid.  Pressure
would appear to be getting to Gingrich.  His recent outbursts include
blaming the welfare state for a particularly horrific triple murder
and admitting to allowing perceived snubs on board the presidential
plane on route to the funeral of assassinated Israeli leader, Yitzhak
Rabin, to play a part in his decision to bring government to a
standstill.  Such respectively ludicrous and petulant behavior has
done little to endear him to a public which has already signaled its
distaste over his attacks on the most vulnerable within American
society.

In addition, Gingrich faces investigation over charges of violating
campaign finance laws filed against him by the Federal Election
Commission.  According to the FEC, an organization called the Grand
Old Party Action Committee (Gopac), chaired by Gingrich since 1986
and used by him as a vehicle for regenerating the party's grass roots
support, channeled some US$250,000 into Gingrich's campaign for
reelection as a congressman in Georgia in 1990.  This, says the FEC,
was illegal because Gopac did not formally register as a federal
political action committee.  If found guilty, Gingrich stands to be
fined a considerable amount, not to mention the damage to whatever
political standing he has remaining at that time.

So, with Gingrich out of the frame, the Republican party's only
obvious hope for the presidency now lies with Senator Robert Dole.
Dole himself, has suffered something of a setback recently though.
In a straw poll in Florida amongst 3,300 registered Republicans that
is widely regarded as the start of the nominations process, Dole took
an unconvincing 33% of the vote.  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas came in
second with 26% and former Tennessee governor, Lamar Alexander,
polled 22.5%.  The fact that Dole was unable to secure a greater
percentage lead over his supposedly little-hoper opponents can only
present further worries for the Republican party as a whole.

These worries must have been heightened yet further by the party's
poor showing in off-year elections throughout the country.  Despite
being convinced that for the first time since the civil war,
Republicans would control both chambers in the Virginia legislature,
the Democrats retained their 52-47 majority in the lower house and
drew 20-20 with the Republicans in the state senate.  The casting
vote in the senate goes, however, to a Democrat.  Similar results
were posted in several other polls, but the Republicans did hold on
to the governorship of Kirk Fordice in Mississippi.

All this is, of course, cheering news to Clinton.  Provided the
president is able to secure the welfare system protection he wants
while still reducing the period in which the deficit will be cleared
to seven years, both approved by the electorate, he will have
achieved an important compromise that could well ensure his return to
office.

Clinton is not unassailable, however. Implementation of the so-called
Dayton peace agreement signed between the Presidents of Bosnia,
Serbia and Croatia in Paris in mid December will require the presence
of some 20,000 US troops to be deployed in Bosnia.  This is
particularly contentious domestically.  A majority of Republicans,
and probably a majority of the American people, fear a re-ignition of
the war in Bosnia that will result in the deaths of many US
servicemen.

Clinton has achieved wide recognition for his part in the brokerage
of the deal, but his decision to send troops could well backfire
should considerable US casualties ensue.  While it is traditional for
the electorate to rally round a President in conflict situations, the
last thing Clinton will want to see in an election year is large
numbers of body-bags returning home.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ECONOMY

Discussion over the possibility of an interest rate cut surfaced
again in November following the release of economic indicator figures
that suggest that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing.

Industrial production fell in October, with output down by 0.3% to
register its first decline in six months.  Some 0.2% of this decrease
can be attributed to the strike at aircraft maker, Boeing, but
according to analysts, even with this taken into consideration, most
sectors were flat or slightly down.  Output of consumer goods,
business equipment and construction supplies were down by 0.5, 0.8,
and 0.6% respectively.  These figures were reflected in the
Purchasing Managers' Index of manufacturing activity which fell by
0.3% in November to 46.5%.  A figure of below 50% indicates a
contraction in manufacturing and the November figure is the sixth in
seven months to indicate a decline, taking the index closer to the
44.5% figure at which the economy as a whole is said to be in
contraction.

Consumer confidence figures as measured by the New York business
analysis group, The Conference Board, remain strong.  The Board's
figure for November rose to 101.4 as against 96.3 in October.
Readings of above 100 have traditionally been associated with periods
of rapid economic growth.  The apparent strength of confidence among
consumers is not, however, expected to translate itself into high
retail sales figures for Christmas.  The Commerce Department
registered a 0.2% decline in sales in October .  According to the
department, high levels of indebtedness will prevent consumer
confidence boosting this position for the time being.

As for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in
October as a result of sharp increases in the cost of housing, energy
and clothing.  The core CPI, which discounts food and energy prices,
also showed a 0.3% rise.  Despite most economists now believing that
the economy is slowing and will probably only post a quite moderate
2.4% GDP growth figure for 1996, the possibility of upward pressure
on inflation still makes imminent cuts in interest rates unlikely.
The Fed is not known for impulsive moves and, in our opinion,
decisions on whether or not to give the economy a moderate boost will
not take place until early next year.

Foreign Trade
Sluggish domestic demand has been held responsible for a second
consecutive fall in the US monthly trade deficit figures.  The
commerce department said that the deficit fell to US$8.3 billion in
September as against expectations that it would be as high as US$9.5
billion.  This comes on top of the fall in August to US$8.4 billion.

Within the figures lurks a decline in the bilateral deficit with
Japan, subject of much disagreement between the two countries of
late, from US$5.1 billion to US$4.3 billion, its lowest level in two
years.

Exports rose 1.6% between August and September to US$67.2 billion.
This more than offset the percentage rise, at 1.4%, of imports which
increased in value to US$75.6 billion.  Exports were 10.3% higher
than in the September 1994 and imports were up by 8.4% over the same
period.  The deficit was US$90 billion for the first nine months of
1995, up from US$78.7 billion over the same period in 1994.  A
deficit of US$136.8 billion in goods was partially offset by a
US$46.8 surplus on trade in services.
