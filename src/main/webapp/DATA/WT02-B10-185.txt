The department has continued to develop and improve procedures to aid clinicians and investigators in the assessment of both patients and nonpatients. Data collection and recording procedures (along with training programs for clinicians and computer programs to assist in the scoring and analysis of the data) are made available to investigators and clinicians at Psychiatric Institute, in other New York State facilities, as well as elsewhere in the United States and abroad. These procedures are primarily focused upon diagnosis, evaluation of severity symptoms and functioning, quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction, and work productivity. Substantive research studies are also conducted by members of the department. Some ongoing during 1994 are briefly described below.

<B>Major Mood Disorder Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of the projects directed by Dr. Jean Endicott and her staff are focused upon the course of illness of patients who have major mood disorders. A large scale NIMH-funded multifacility long-term follow-up study of 955 patients with major mood disorders is still ongoing. To date, subjects have been followed between 14 and 17 years. During the intake episode and in subsequent episodes, depressed subjects who have active alcoholism have only half the likelihood of recovery of those who are not abusing alcohol. During the first 10 years of follow-up, patients with manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder had a mean of <BR>
4.5 hospitalizations and continued to have remissions and recurrences with no evidence of a tendency for the disorder to become less active. Patients who entered the study with a first episode of major depressive disorder also were at high risk to have at least one additional period of major depressive disorder (over 50% did so) and to attempt suicide <BR>
(25% did so). These findings, coupled with those reported previously indicate that the major mood disorders tend to recur or become chronic and are associated with major negative consequences for the majority of patients who suffer from them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other studies funded by NICHD of women who have had prior episodes of major depressive disorder indicate that they are at a very high risk of having subsequent episodes, particularly if they report having severe dysphoric mood changes premenstrually. Dr. Endicott's group participated in a large multifacility study of the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder with sertraline or placebo which indicated that sertraline was quite effective in treating this condition. These findings were in keeping with previous work of Dr. Endicott and her group and support efforts to encourage women to obtain treatment for severe premenstrual mood changes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The follow-up studies conducted by Dr. Endicott's group as well as the findings from a NARSAD-supported study of the barriers to seeking and receiving treatment indicate that most patients with a major mood disorder still delay or never seek treatment when such is warranted. Although the reasons for this are multiple, two major problems continue to be cost and stigma.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Members of the department have continued to participate in studies of the genetics of mood disorders. Dr. Endicott received funding from NIMH for a new multifacility linkage study of recurrent major depressive disorders. Dr. Endicott's staff will be responsible for making the "best estimate" diagnoses for the subjects from all five facilities. The staff has continued to work with Drs. Baron, Gilliam, and Ott on a linkage study of bipolar disorder with mania. The group recently published findings supportive of possible linkage of the disorder to a gene on chromosome 21.
<H3> ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Alcohol and Drug Problem Studies</B>
</H3
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Deborah Hasin and her staff continued to work on multiple facets of alcohol and drug problems, including diagnostic assessment, investigation of longitudinal course, issues of psychiatric comorbidity, and general population patterns. This work is funded by NIAAA and NIDA.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Analyses of her follow-up study of 969 community residents who were at high risk for alcohol dependence showed that most of those who met criteria for alcohol dependence at the time of the first interview did so only at a mild level and were much more likely to manifest psychological aspects of alcohol dependence than physiological aspects (such as a full withdrawal syndrome). Analyses of one-year follow-up interviews showed that severity of alcohol dependence at the initial interview predicted continuing difficulties with alcoholism one year later. Severity of alcoholism outweighed sex, age, social status, and depression in predicting ongoing problems with alcoholism.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Hasin's group is in early stages of a longitudinal study of the course of drug and alcohol dependence in patients who have substance abuse problems as well as varying types and levels of psychiatric difficulties. Several hundred patients will be evaluated when they enter treatment and will be followed up every six months for two years to determine the relationship of the psychiatric and substance abuse problems, and how these appear to be affected by treatment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Hasin has also collaborated with colleagues at NIAAA in investigating help-<BR>
seeking for alcohol problems among former drinkers in the U.S. The information came from a national survey of about 40,000 Americans. A substantial minority (about 40%) of former drinkers had met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol abuse or dependence at some time in the past. However, only a small proportion (7%) of those who had stopped drinking had sought help for alcohol problems. Those who had sought specialized help were likely to have reported a sense of compulsion to drink, heavier alcohol consumption, and social pressure to cut down on their drinking.
<H3> ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Infertility Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Jennifer Downey has continued to study women who suffer from infertility and the possible effects of the new reproductive technologies on their likelihood of development of a mental disorder. A paper by one of Dr. Downey's graduate students based upon this work recently won first prize in a competition for best paper by a trainee sponsored by the American Society for Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Menstrual Cycle Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Dianne Schechter's NIMH-funded work has focused upon efforts to identify factors that may be associated with the pathophysiology of severe premenstrual dysphoric mood changes. She has examined several endocrine parameters and their association with severity of premenstrual mood changes in women who have been studied intensively over at least five menstrual cycles. The strongest relationships were a positive association between luteal phase pregnanediol levels and severity of mood changes and a negative association of the severity of mood changes and late follicular estrone and luteal estrone levels. The results of the study supported efforts to obtain funding to study a larger sample of subjects and a proposal was submitted to NIMH.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A NARSAD-funded study of menstrual cycle fluctuations in severity of psychotic and affective symptoms in women with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder is being conducted by Dr. Schechter in collaboration with the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Preliminary data suggests that, at least for some women, symptom severity may decrease just prior to ovulation and increase just prior to menses and perhaps just after ovulation. If these findings are confirmed with a larger sample, they would have implications for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the symptom formation and for treatment and management.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Reliability and Validity Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reliability and validity studies of procedures developed by members of the department was conducted, new training materials were prepared, and consultation was given to other investigators who plan to employ them in their studies. Those of primary focus during 1994 were the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) developed by Dr. Hasin and colleagues and the Work Productivity Scale developed by Dr. Endicott.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Dianne Schechter continued to direct the Mental Health Clinical Research Center Normal Controls project. Over 40 investigators successfully recruited subjects for their studies from the pool of over 1,000 subjects who have been enrolled in this project.
