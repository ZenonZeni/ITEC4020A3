<P><B>FCC RELEASES RECOMMENDATIONS.</B> On November 7 the FCC and the Jt. Board (a board established to develop special rates for schools and libraries) released their recommendations. The Joint Board recommends providing higher discounts for economically disadvantaged schools and libraries and those entities located in high cost areas. Discounts are a minimum of 20% and range from 40-90% for all but the least disadvantaged schools and libraries.</P>
<P>The 1996 Act directs the Federal-State Joint Board to adopt new universal service support mechanisms that are specific, predictable, and sufficient to advance the universal service principles enumerated in the Act. One principle enunciated in the Act is &quot;Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries, should have access to advanced telecommunications services. &quot;</P>
<P>The Joint Board recommends that eligible schools and libraries be able to purchase at a discount any telecommunications services, internal connections among classrooms, and access to the Internet. The Joint Board recommends providing higher discounts for economically disadvantaged schools and libraries and those entities located in high cost areas. Discounts are a minimum of 20% and range from 40-90% for all but the least disadvantaged schools and libraries. Total expenditures for universal service support for schools and libraries is capped at $2.25 billion per year, although any funds not disbursed in a given year may be carried forward and also disbursed.
