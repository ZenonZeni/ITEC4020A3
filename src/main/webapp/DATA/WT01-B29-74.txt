<h1>The Washington Hemp Education Network </h1>

<p> <strong>Operating Abstract</strong> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p> The following text defines the structure and mission of a
non-profit educational organization known as the Washington Hemp
Education Network (W.H.E.N.). This organization consists of
volunteer members. </p>

<h2>Mission Statement </h2>

<p> The mission of the Washington Hemp Education Network
(W.H.E.N.) is to empower the people of Washington State, through
educational activities about the history, status, and uses (both
current and potential) of the Hemp plant (cannabis sativa, also
known as marijuana), to make informed choices about the issues
surrounding re-legalization of Hemp in Washington State. </p>

<h2>Recognition of Benefit </h2>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network recognizes as
beneficial all responsible commercial, medicinal, and spiritual
uses of the Hemp plant conducted for peaceful ends. </p>

<h2>Program and Goals </h2>

<p> To achieve the stated mission, the Washington Hemp Education
Network will plan and implement legal, nonviolent projects that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Raise public awareness of the history and beneficial uses
        of the Hemp plant; </li>
    <li>Educate the public to recognize and reject misinformation
        about Hemp; </li>
    <li>Facilitate changes in current laws to allow the people of
        Washington State to grow Hemp openly and engage in normal
        market activities with Hemp products; </li>
    <li>Through education and coalition, help to empower people
        who have been disempowered by misguided government
        policies concerning Hemp; </li>
    <li>Promote research and development of sustainable,
        environmentally responsible Hemp cultivation, and of
        beneficial products derived from Hemp. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Criteria </h3>

<p> All projects planned and implemented by the Washington Hemp
Education Network will be consistent with the Mission,
Recognition of Benefit, and Program and Goals statements defined
herein. </p>

<h3>Endorsement and Support </h3>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network will endorse and
support only those projects undertaken by individuals or other
entities that are consistent with the Mission, Recognition of
Benefit, and Program and Goals. </p>

<h2>Method of Operation </h2>

<p> This organization will meet regularly and will operate on the
principle of consensus. As defined by the Center for Conflict
Resolution, Madison, WI, consensus is &quot;a decision-making
process in which all parties involved explicitly agree to the
final decision. </p>

<p> Consensus decision making does not mean that all parties are
completely satisfied with the final outcome, but that the
decision is acceptable to all because no one feels that his or
her vital interests or values are violated by it.&quot; </p>

<p> A board of directors will not be elected; rather, the
founding charter members will constitute the decision-making
body, will serve as the projects and issues forum facilitation
group, and will exercise no power other than that of presiding
over meetings as defined by the Method of Operation, and of
approving membership applications and filling vacancies in the
charter member group when a charter member leaves the group. </p>

<p> Other future members may be added to the decision-making body
of charter members if a consensus decision for such action is
made by the charter members. Members other than charter members
are encouraged to participate in discussions on issues that are
being addressed during the decision-making process; participation
in the final consensus </p>

<p> decision is limited to charter members. </p>

<h3>Consensus Procedures </h3>

<ul>
    <li>o For each meeting, the charter members will appoint a
        rotating clerk, who will convene the meeting and govern
        the discussions during the meeting. The clerk is
        responsible for compiling and disseminating the agenda
        and supporting materials at least four days prior to the
        meeting. </li>
    <li>o If one or more members feel that a decision must be
        reached, the clerk must clearly state the issue to be
        decided and allow each member to speak uninterrupted
        about the issue. After each member speaks once about the
        issue, it can be debated if necessary by the group;
        however, members must not interrupt other speakers and
        must wait until granted the floor by the clerk before
        speaking. </li>
    <li>o Members must listen attentively and strive to
        understand each point of view, knowing that through the
        consensus process each decision must ultimately be a
        compromise of all points of view. </li>
    <li>o The clerk will develop a decision statement as the
        debate proceeds. The clerk will then document the
        evolution of the debate and will modify the position of
        the group by incorporating each point of view into the
        decision statement. </li>
    <li>o When all points of view have been made known, and the
        decision statement has reached a static state, the clerk
        will call for consensus on the statement. Three possible
        positions may be taken by the charter members: Consent,
        Object, or Stand Aside: </li>
    <li>o Consent indicates the member agrees to support the
        decision as the best compromise that can be achieved by
        the group. </li>
    <li>o Object indicates the member will not allow consensus to
        occur; if ONE member objects, the decision is discarded
        and no action is taken on the issue by the organization
        at that time. </li>
    <li>o Stand Aside indicates the member cannot agree with the
        decision but will not prevent the decision from being
        adopted </li>
    <li>by the group; the decision stands as long as no one
        indicates </li>
</ul>

<h2>Object. </h2>

<p> These procedures should suffice for most issues facing the
charter members of W.H.E.N. If a situation should arise that
cannot be resolved by the above procedures, the clerk will
reference the consensus handbook published by the Center for
Conflict Resolution. Charter members who are absent from
announced meetings are by default relinquishing their consensus
vote for the affected meetings only. </p>
