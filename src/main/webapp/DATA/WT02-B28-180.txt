<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Importance of a Will</STRONG></FONT><P>


Despite the importance of the will in an estate plan, it is estimated that seven out of ten
Americans die without a valid will<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>.<P>
If a will is such an important document, why don't more people have one? Unfortunately,
creating a will forces you to come face to face with your own mortality - and dealing with
death is difficult. But, it may be much more difficult for your loved ones after you are gone
if you don't prepare a will.<P>

<STRONG>A Financial Blueprint of Your Assets</STRONG><BR>
A will is an instrument, an extremely powerful instrument, you can use to distribute your
probate assets to your loved ones after you are gone. (Probate assets generally refer to
those assets in your name only that do not pass to another at your death by operation of
law.) Think of your will as the financial blueprint of your probate assets. Your will clearly
states who will inherit your probate assets, when they will inherit your probate assets, and
any conditions that must be met for them to receive your probate assets.<P>
At death, the court rules on the validity of your will. If the will is valid, the court
instructs your executor to carry out the terms of the will according to your wishes. (This
act is known as a decree of probate.) The executor is the person appointed by you in the will
to supervise the distribution of your probate assets.<P>

<STRONG>What Are the Consequences of Not Having a Will?</STRONG><BR>
According to Gerald Condon and Jeffrey Condon, authors of Beyond the Grave, without a will,
you increase the likelihood of conflicts, bitterness, and after-death disputes between your
children and other family members. Here's how: If you die without a valid will, the court
does not have your financial blueprint to follow. Therefore, it has no way of knowing how to
distribute your assets. <P>
By "dying intestate," you lose the ability to direct the distribution of your estate. The
state where you lived steps in at your death and makes the decisions for you, according to
the distribution schedule set forth in its intestacy statutes. The state's decisions are designed 
to pass property to those who would most benefit. Unfortunately, the
state's decisions may not conform to your wishes or to what is best for the people closest to
you. Intestacy usually means outright payments. This can cause a multitude of problems and
misunderstandings, not to mention tying up your assets in the probate process for months or
years. <P>

<STRONG>Common Misconceptions</STRONG><BR>
Here are some of the more common rationalizations for not creating a will, and the facts that
quickly dispel those "myths."<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "My assets are so small that a will is not necessary."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> Think again. Few people are worth so little that a will is not
necessary. Add together
the value of your home, car, furniture, jewelry, savings account, and investment portfolio. 
Subtract from this total your personal debts. The bottom line is that you are generally worth
more than you think. Even if some items do not hold great monetary value, they could hold an
enormous amount of sentimental value. Failing to indicate who receives these treasures in
your will can cause friction between family members that lasts for decades.<P>

<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "When I die, my spouse will get all of my assets."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> If you and your spouse own assets jointly, at death your share of the
assets will
automatically go to the surviving spouse. But, what happens when your surviving spouse dies?
What will your children receive? Does your spouse have the financial know-how to manage the
family wealth? If your spouse remarries, some or all of your spouse's assets may wind up in
the hands of his/her new spouse.<P>    

<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "I can create a will on my own and save the legal costs."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> "Do-it-yourself" wills often do not contain all of the necessary
components as required by law and are frequently ruled invalid by the courts. A
vaguely-worded clause can result in lengthy legal battles. Anyone who might benefit from the
invalidation of your will can contest it, and if the courts decide in his or her favor your
estate may be required to cover all legal costs. Remember, the few dollars you save now can
cost your loved ones thousands of dollars later. <P>

<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "I don't want my final wishes to be set in stone. I'll create a will
later in my life."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> A will is an extremely flexible document whose terms can be changed as
often as needed. In fact, any legal expert will tell you that a will should be re-examined
periodically to make sure it is up to date. A will should receive a checkup whenever there is
a substantial change in your life. Remember, the terms of a will only become effective at
death. <P> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>How Do You Create A Will?</STRONG><BR>
Drafting a will is a highly technical task. That's why it is an endeavor you do not want to
tackle single-handedly. It's important that you call on the services of an inheritance
planning lawyer. Having a lawyer assist you in drawing up a will has several advantages. A
lawyer can help you: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Avoid the problems of "do-it-yourself" wills 
<LI>Save on estate taxes 
<LI>Take advantage of opportunities people often overlook  
<LI>Change the terms of your will
</UL>
<STRONG>Points Often Neglected In Drawing Up Wills</STRONG><BR>
In discussions with your lawyer, be sure to ask yourself the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Does my will take advantage of the unlimited marital deduction?
<LI>How are estate taxes allocated among beneficiaries?
<LI>Have any precautions been taken to minimize the double taxation of the estate - once at
the death of each spouse?
<LI>Have arrangements been made to establish who legally died first in the event of the
apparent simultaneous death of both spouses?
<LI>Should the executor of my estate have the power to run or dispose of my business?  
<LI>Have all insurance arrangements been considered in your will?
</UL>

<STRONG>Where Does Life Insurance Fit Into The Picture?</STRONG><BR>
Life insurance is a vehicle you can use to make sure the size of your estate is not severely
depleted at death. In most instances, life insurance proceeds are paid income tax free to
your beneficiary(ies). Life insurance proceeds may also be arranged to be estate tax free.
Besides replacing the lost income of a wage earner, the proceeds from a life insurance policy
can provide estate liquidity. They can pay the estate's income taxes, state death taxes,
funeral costs, any outstanding debts, probate costs, and other miscellaneous expenses that
occur at death. <P>
Without life insurance proceeds, a portion of your estate may have to be sold quickly to meet
expenses. This often forces your heirs to sell assets at depressed prices because of the
immediate need for cash. The result: a depletion of your estate and a reduction in the amount
your heirs receive. <P>

<STRONG>The Decision Is Up To You</STRONG><BR>
You spent a lifetime building and gathering your assets. It's up to you to make sure your
assets get distributed the way you want. A will is a tool you can use to achieve this goal.
At New York Life, our agents, in conjunction with your inheritance planning attorney, will
help evaluate your needs and recommend solutions that will maximize your will's potential.
