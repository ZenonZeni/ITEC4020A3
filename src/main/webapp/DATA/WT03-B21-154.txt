<P><CENTER><B>TVX GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES THAT GREEK PARLIAMENT RATIFIES KASSANDRA MINES CONTRACT AND RELATED PROVISIONS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, July 31, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce that the Greek Government bill to ratify the Kassandra Mines purchase contract, including the related articles providing for  the ratification of  the  35 per cent grants from the Greek State and regulations for the timely issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant for the Kassandra Mines, was  today passed by the Greek Parliament and will become law upon normal publication in the Official Gazette. 

<P>While the main provisions of the purchase contract effecting the legal transfer of the Kassandra Mines assets to TVX Gold Inc.'s  wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., was legally effective without further action upon its signing  on December 21, 1995, the Greek Government chose to ratify the entire contract together with the necessary provisions relating to the grants and the permits which did legally require Parliamentary approval.  The approval of the bill was supported by the three major political parties: the ruling PASOK party; the official opposition party, New Democracy and  the Political Spring party; which collectively represent 97% of  the seats in the Greek Parliament.

<P>Since the signing of the purchase contract in December 1995, TVX Hellas has been concentrating on the comprehensive review and refurbishment of the existing operations including the Olympias and Stratoni mills, the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and the port facility at Stratoni. A comprehensive environmental review is being undertaken and some remedial work is already underway. The  retraining of existing employees is also well advanced. To date, the basic refurbishment and upgrading of the Stratoni mill has been completed with the Madem Lakkos mine currently operating to supply feed to the Stratoni mill. The first shipments of lead/silver and zinc concentrates, respectively, occurred in July. 

<P>The completion of the Parliamentary approval process will facilitate progress at  the Olympias mine and mill complex and work related to the gold recovery plant.
