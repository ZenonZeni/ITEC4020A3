<h1>Diagnosis? &#133; Sick Building Syndrome</h1>

<h1>Treatment? &#133; Early Claims Intervention</h1>

<p><em>By Mark Hyland, Assistant Vice President</em></p>

<hr color="#008080">

<p>Everyone has heard of the phenomenon of &quot;sick building
syndrome.&quot; Usually we associate this problem with modern
office buildings. Healthcare facilities, of all sorts, are not
immune to this modern risk. Well documented case studies of
&quot;sick-hospital syndrome&quot; are available in the medical
journals. Our experience shows that it is most often the older
facility which is undergoing construction or has recently been
refurbished that experiences this kind of employee complaint and
subsequent workers; compensation claim.</p>

<p>The best treatment is Early Response-to a worker&#146;s first
complaint of &quot;something is making me sick&quot; as well as
to an employee&#146;s compensation claim for an occupational
respiratory ailment.</p>

<p>&quot;Indoor air pollution&quot; signs and symptoms usually
fall into two categories-those impacting the general environment
and those which have begun to affect employee health. Workers may
report unusual smells or dust in their areas. They may even have
an idea of the origin of the nuisance (for example, the exhaust
from the delivery truck which is going into the building&#146;s
air intake vent.) Other times employees only begin to suspect
that their health problems are related to a workplace exposure
after they gave received treatment. Symptoms of upper-respiratory
irritation and lower respiratory distress, as well as burning
eyes, dry skin and dermatitis, headache, fatigue and dizziness
may be caused by poor air quality.</p>

<p>A quick response to early reports of environmental problems
may give you the chance to fix the problem before employees begin
to go to their doctors or the employee health nurse. Bring in
your maintenance manager or the facility&#146;s industrial
hygienist and do physical surveys of the site in question. Try to
identify if anything has changed in that location recently.
Inspect the air handling equipment-with an emphasis on looking at
the total system from air intake to exhaust. Further detective
work might involve air monitoring, wipe samples and possibly
physical exams for exposed employees.</p>

<p>If an employee files a worker&#146;s compensation claim, a
quick response is also the best management practice. Your SIS
claims consultant should be notified. All medical records must be
obtained. Expert medical opinions may be appropriate. The
employee&#146;s work site needs to be surveyed and statements
obtained from the claimant as well as fellow workers. Any
documentation of earlier employee complaints should be reviewed.
Other experts may need to be brought in to conduct further
investigations.</p>

<p>A prompt management response is also appropriate when a final
decision is made concerning a claim. Ignoring early reports or
delaying decisions on claims will only raise employee concerns
further. In the case of sick building syndrome &quot; a sniff in
time saves nine!&quot;</p>
