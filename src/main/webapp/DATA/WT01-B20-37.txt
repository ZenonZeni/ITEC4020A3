<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Resolution To Be Unveiled
At Upcoming Conference</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 9, 1995, San Diego, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
resolution calling for governments everywhere to &quot;immediately
rescind their policies of arresting ... marijuana consumers who
currently possess and/or cultivate cannabis for their own medical
use&quot; will be introduced by Dr. Erik Fromberg at the 37th
International Congress on Drugs and Alcohol Dependency.&nbsp; The
resolution further demands that governments start separating the
medical issue &quot;from the recreational drug issue and begin actively
studying cannabis' use as a therapeutic agent.&quot;&nbsp; Dr.
Fromberg is a representative from the Netherlands Institute on
Alcohol and Drugs (NIAD).&nbsp; The international conference is
scheduled to be held August 20-25 in San Diego, California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also attending the Congress will be the Todd McCormick
Alliance.&nbsp; The Alliance has declared an &quot;international
state of emergency on medical cannabis&quot; and is embarking on
an &quot;information blitz&quot; to raise public awareness.&nbsp;
The organization will be holding a round table discussion on the
medical use of cannabis on August 22 and is planning to hold a
public rally on August 25.&nbsp; The group is named after San
Diego Compassionate Use Club founder and medical marijuana user,
Todd McCormick.&nbsp; McCormick was arrested in Ohio on July 18
when State Highway Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty
pounds of marijuana in his van.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the cannabis was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate
Use Club in his home state of Rhode Island. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information about the medical marijuana resolution,
please contact Richard Cowan @ (202) 483-5500 or the Todd
McCormick Alliance @ (619) 582-7303.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Registered Nurse Contacts NORML In An Appeal
To Save The Life Of Her Patient</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 4, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; In an
attempt to stimulate national attention and awareness to the
plight of her patient, Richard G. Martinez, neuro-rehabilitation
nurse and Martinez's legal guardian, Constance Theis, has
contacted <b>NORML</b> with a story of unparalleled injustice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After having been shot through the left eye in 1991, Richard
Martinez was left with an excruciatingly painful nerve disorder
known as trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp; In addition, many fragments from
the bullet could not be removed during surgery and still remain
lodged in Martinez's brain.&nbsp; The presence of these fragments
induces cognitive deficits and seizure disorders and also gives
rise to frequent bouts of intense nausea and severe
depression.&nbsp; To help alleviate Martinez's daily pain, he was
granted a legal prescription for Marinol -- a federally approved
THC synthetic drug.&nbsp; The Marinol, however, ended up being
far too expensive ($636.00 per month) for Martinez to afford on
his social security disability-based income.&nbsp; As a result,
Martinez turned to the next logical substitute, natural cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez was turned in to authorities for possessing marijuana by
a relative in exchange for a small financial reward.&nbsp; He now
sits in Durango County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona, where he is
forced to sleep on a dirty floor and is prevented from taking his
proper medication.&nbsp; While in jail, Martinez has suffered
numerous staph infections in the eye socket and ear.&nbsp; Staph
infections put tremendous pressure on the heart and, if left
untreated, can be fatal.&nbsp; The tremendous swelling from these infections
is causing green pus to flow from Martinez's right nostril.&nbsp;
In addition, Martinez's serious infections are destroying
valuable tissue and bone in his face.&nbsp; This deterioration
has gotten so extreme that Martinez now believes that his eye may
actually be &quot;rotting.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez is also experiencing critically high blood pressure and
is now at risk of suffering a stroke.&nbsp; This occurrence is a
natural physical result of untreated pain and infection.&nbsp;
The threat of a severe stroke -- in addition to his constant
fevers, infections, tissue deterioration, and ear aches -- makes
Martinez's incarceration highly life threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the reports of three separate physicians, Martinez's
head wound seriously damaged his right frontal lobe and has
rendered him mentally incompetent.&nbsp; Therefore, he can not legally
stand trial.&nbsp; The state, however, wants Martinez to appear
in court regardless.&nbsp; Consequently, psychologists at the
Durango County Jail are working round the clock to have Martinez
declared mentally competent.&nbsp; Ms. Theis maintains that this
process can last as long a seven or eight months -- a time frame
that she believes Martinez will not survive.&nbsp; The bitter
irony is that the state is trying to legally rehabilitate a man
with braln damage solely for the purpose of throwing him back in
jail.&nbsp; All this because Martinez was trying to alleviate
daily pain, nausea, and seizures with the only effective
therapeutic agent he could financially afford -- marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Constance Theis maintains that her patient's life is in danger
every additional day he stays in the Durango County Jail.&nbsp;
She can be contacted at the following numbers: (602) 790-1595
(home) or (602) 325-1300 EXT 4435 (work).</p>
