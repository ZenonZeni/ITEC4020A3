<H1>What Are Restricted Tests</H1>
<IMG SRC="bar1.gif" ALIGN=middle>
</CENTER>
<P>Restricted tests may not be purchased by an individual unless (s)he  possesses certain credentials. Tests are generally grouped into 3 restriction categories...
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>Tests which anyone may purchase who has a knowledge of how tests may be used... known as <EM>level A, category 1, or level 1</EM> tests.
<LI>Tests where some formal experience and knowledge of testing is required. The publisher requires that the test purchaser has a level of knowledge sufficient to use the test before allowing sale... known as<EM> level B, category 2, or level 2</EM> tests.
<LI>Tests which are restricted for sale only to members of a professional association which certifies the individual is licensed to practice psychology or psychiatry... known as<EM> level C, category 3, or level 3</EM> tests. 
</OL>
<H1>What Does This mean?</H1>
<P>It means one can only buy tests which may be useful in conducting legitimate business. The restrictions listed above will not normally prevent anybody from obtaining any test which could be used effectively. 
<H2>Level 1 tests </H2>
<P>Users of level 1 tests should know as much about tests as is contained in this article, and must have a work related reason for obtaining the test. This may include teaching or research in the field of psychology at a college or university. Note: we do not sell tests directly to students -- only to instructors/supervisors who are expected to be responsible for the proper handling of the tests by their students.
<H2>Level 2 tests </H2>
<P>Users of level 2 tests must meet the criteria for level 1 and must in addition meet the requirements of the publisher as regards elegibility for the specific test. The requirements are seldom much different from those for level 1.
<H2>Level 3 tests </H2>
<P>Level 3 tests are restricted to use by professional psychologists, psychiatrists, or those with a similar suitable designation. Level 3 tests include those which are useful in the assessment of psychopathology. These tests often require careful interpretation. Frequently, useful results can only be obtained by people with training in the use of the specific test. If you are curious about this type of test, we suggest that much more can be learned about testing and about psychology from texts which are freely available in every library, and from courses taught in colleges and universities, than can be learned from a copies of tests.
<H1>Why Restrict Tests</H1>
<P>If individuals are to be given tests for any reason, and if the test's validity relies on these individuals not having seen the test prior to administration, then it is evident that such tests must not be given out to general circulation. This is more important for <A HREF="WhatAreS.html">standardized tests</A> than it is of the final exam on which a teacher will base student grades. Since <A HREF="WhatAreS.html">standardized tests</A>
 can only be developed at great expense -- through specialized knowledge and extensive research -- it becomes much more important that knowledge of test content be safeguarded from the general public.
<P>From the above one can see that test publishers find themselves in a somewhat paradoxical position. They make their money by selling copies of tests, however, they cannot generally distribute tests without destroying the utility of (and future sales of) their product. To ensure that a test will continue to be useful, publishers classify their standardized test products according to who may purchase them. Publishers expect that users will not destroy a test that is purchased by showing it to people unnecessarily. Test purchasers are expected to keep tests under lock and key, and to see that all copies of tests are destroyed when they are no longer required. This expectation is not to be confused with the legal <A HREF="WhatCopy.html">copyright</A> 
under which test purchasers must buy copies of tests from the publisher rather than reproduce them locally.
<H2>Psychology and Restricted tests</H2>
<P>No group relies on the availability and validity of standardized tests more than professional psychologists. Early on, the American Psychological Association (APA) developed guidelines for the handling and use of testing materials. APA guidelines were set out to assist members in understanding the proper handling of tests. Other ethical guidelines protect the public and protect the reputation of the profession. These ethical principles indicated that members must limit themselves to areas of practice in which they held an acceptable level of experience and competence. Thus tests used by psychologists are doubly protected because the publishers will only sell to psychologists, and the psychologists are bound by regulations of their professional association not to engage in behavior that would destroy the validity of the tests.
<P>Most provinces in Canada and U.S. States have Professional Psychologists Associations, and most of these associations  have produced their own version of the APA guidelines and have a body of regulations which govern ethical conduct. Most of these associations have some sort of a web page. Although we do not list each state organization on our <A HREF="WWLinks.html">Web Links page</A>
, from our links page you can jump to the APA or CPA page and from there you can find good lists of links to state or provicial psychological associations. All of these associations have staff or volunteers who would be glad to provide information about any aspect of the practice of psychology in your region.<CENTER>
