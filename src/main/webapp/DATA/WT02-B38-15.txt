EBT'S NATIONAL QUEST:  Negotiations are under way to create the first

EBT'S NATIONAL QUEST:  Negotiations are under way to create the first
national electronic benefits transfer network.  The electronic benefits
council of the National Automated Clearing House Association is negotiating
with the board of directors of the Quest shared regional EFT network to use
the Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards, CardFax has learned.  The
council will use the mark to let benefit recipients know where they can use
their cards.  The council, which was formed last year to create a national set
of EBT operating rules, adopted a set of standards in principle last month
(CardFax 12/19).  "If you start from scratch, there's a lot of paperwork and
forms you must fill out in developing a logo.  We can avoid that by buying an
existing logo," Helena Sims, senior director of the council, tells CardFax.
The council hopes to complete the negotiations within several weeks, Sims
says.  The logo would be purchased with funds collected from member dues.
Terms of the deal, including what the council will pay to use the Quest logo,
were not revealed.



The Kentucky-based Quest EFT network dissolved in July 1995 after its member
institutions migrated to the Delaware-based MAC regional EFT network.  The
network-which exists in name only-is owned by Transaction Services Co.  Equity
owners of Transaction Services include Transfinancial Bank, PNC Bank of
Kentucky, National City Bank of Kentucky, Owensboro National Bank, Bank of
Louisville, Bank One Kentucky and Bank One Lexington.  "We don't want the
Quest mark to be used in a bank-owned ATM environment, but we may consider
using the mark on EBT cards," Al Metzler, Bank One Kentucky senior vice
president and chairman of the Quest board, tells CardFax.

PROFIT PICTURE:  Competition and higher funding costs pulled credit card

PROFIT PICTURE:  Competition and higher funding costs pulled credit card
profits down in 1995, Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Investment
Bankers, estimates.  Hammer says general-purpose cards had a 3.60% pre-tax
return on assets and a 2.16% after-tax return last year, down 30 basis points
(0.3 percentage points) from 1994's returns.  Balance-transfer competition
coupled with a 40-basis-point increase in the average cost of funds to 6.1%,
caused the profit decline.  Estimates are based on interviews with card
issuers, processors and analysts.

INQUIRING FINES:  In February, First Fidelity Bancorp will begin to charge

INQUIRING FINES:  In February, First Fidelity Bancorp will begin to charge
consumers 75 cents for balance inquiries made with tellers and 50 cents for
inquiries made through its toll-free number if their accounts fall below
minimum-balance requirements, CardFax has learned.  Customers still will
receive two free teller inquiries and two free remote inquiries every month.
The fees are an attempt to migrate excess branch inquiries to ATMs.  First
Fidelity has 715 ATMs.

WARNING SIGNS:  Nearly 17% of disposable income now goes to pay mortgage

WARNING SIGNS:  Nearly 17% of disposable income now goes to pay mortgage and
consumer debt, including credit cards, reports Alison Emmerich, associate
director at Standard & Poor's Corp., which rates credit card-backed
securities.  That level is approaching the earlier high of about 18% in 1989.
"It's certainly not up to its peak, but it is moving up, and that's a cause
for concern," Emmerich tells CardFax.

EBT AID:  The Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services has
awarded a seven-year, $11.6 million contract to Deluxe Data Systems for an
electronic benefits transfer program.  The program will begin in Wichita in
July; a statewide rollout will be completed by April 1997.  The federal
government will pay $5.8 million to cover administrative costs.  Some 186,599
recipients receive food stamps in Kansas.

RATE REFORM:  The MAC regional electronic funds transfer network has

RATE REFORM:  The MAC regional electronic funds transfer network has narrowed
the gap in interchange rates within the 30-state network.  Depending on each
market, interchange on a cash withdrawal will vary from 32 cents to 38 cents,
compared to the previous rate of 30 cents to 40 cents.  The ultimate goal is
to have a single rate throughout the network, Phillip Valvardi, network
director, tells CardFax.

STAND TO GAIN:  Executives with card issuers gained more than their

STAND TO GAIN:  Executives with card issuers gained more than their
counterparts at card-support companies (CardFax 12/26), but a trend toward
option-based and at-risk bonuses obscures the actual compensation some execs
stand to realize.  Capital One Financial Corp.  Chairman and CEO Richard D.
Fairbank and President and Chief Operating Officer Nigel W.  Morris could
together garner $52 million if the company's stock hits $50 a share.  Options
granted to First Data Corp.  Chairman Henry C.  Duques had a net gain of more
than $8.4 million in less than six months.

ROOM FOR GROWTH:  Two-thirds of major credit card issuers believe economic
conditions and interest rates will have more of an impact on the card business
in 1996 than mergers or acquisitions, reports a survey of 50 issuers by
executive search firm Allard Associates.  Of those surveyed, approximately 33%
anticipate modest growth in 1996, 58% expect moderate growth, and 9%
anticipate explosive growth.

SOBRIETY:  While the credit card business has been robust in the past three

SOBRIETY:  While the credit card business has been robust in the past three
years, some card executives predict the party will soon take on a somber tone,
prompted partly by intense competition that has resulted in declining response
rates to solicitations.  "We think 1996 will be another difficult year because
the card has become a commodity," says James J.  Ahearn, president of
Boatmen's Credit Card Bank.  While Ahearn predicts receivables could grow as
much as 20% industry wide, he says much of that increase may come from
convenience users who don't pay interest.

GOOD, BAD AND UGLY:  A survey by First Manhattan Consulting Group reports

GOOD, BAD AND UGLY:  A survey by First Manhattan Consulting Group reports
that the typical bank makes money on 30% of its customers, breaks even on 20%,
and loses money on the remaining 50%.  The survey also shows only 2% of
consumers never visit a branch.  "Very few consumers are really self-service
oriented," says Seamus McMahon, First Manhattan's managing vice president, who
adds that the results show the importance of banks freeing up resources from
unprofitable channels to focus on retaining their most desirable customers.

CHIPS ON DEMAND:  Smart cards won't be an everyday item in the U.S.  until

CHIPS ON DEMAND:  Smart cards won't be an everyday item in the U.S.  until at
least 1998, James J.  Farrell III, advertising manager for Motorola Inc.'s
CSIC Microcontroller division, tells CardFax.  Farrell says he expects smart
card trial programs to be launched in 1996, followed by rollouts in 1997.
Motorola, the world's leading supplier of microchips for smart cards, will be
able to produce 10 million microchips per week by 2000, he says.  Motorola is
doubling the size of its smart card factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, to
meet demand and is laying the groundwork for similar factories in Britain and
the U.S.

WORKING TOGETHER:  While collections agencies have resented the intrusion of
attorney collection networks (CardFax 12/11), some agencies and lawyer
networks are working together.  Collections agency Equifax Risk Management
Services in October formed Litigation Access Web with attorney network
Rosenfeld-Net.  As of early last month, Equifax had referred some 800 card
accounts to the network for legal action, Lyle F.  Herrmann, Litigation Access
Web product manager, tells CardFax.

SALES PITCH:  A key selling point of commercial on-line networks for credit

SALES PITCH:  A key selling point of commercial on-line networks for credit
card issuers is that on-line networks are marketing themselves aggressively to
consumers.  America Online, for example, has launched a television advertising
campaign.  "No one is selling the Internet; users must decide for themselves
to log onto it," explains Tim Kemp, manager of emerging technology for First
Chicago Corp.  "On-line networks have their own sales force."  As the
popularity of on-line networks increases, issuers are likely to establish a
presence on more than one network, card experts say.

ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS:  Changes are afoot at the Electronic Funds Transfer
Association.  H.  Kurt Helwig, director of governmental relations, also will
be the executive director and will run the trade group's day-to-day
operations.  Helwig replaces Wayne Boucher, who resigned in September.  The
association also has contracted with consulting firm Benton International to
plan meetings and produce reports for members, says Robert P.  Barone, who
will stay on as chairman and CEO.

OFF-LINE OPTIONS:  Following a debit card industry trend to give cardholders
money back for using off-line cards, National City Corp.  is planning to
implement a rebate program with its Visa check card off-line product in 1996,
Sarah Topper, vice president, tells CardFax.  "Rebates lose some interchange
revenue, but if you get a new customer to use the card regularly, you will see
a net increase in interchange to surpass rebate costs," Topper explains.
Details of the promotion were not disclosed.

NETTERS:  The number of U.S.  households connected to the Internet will grow
from 8.4 million in 1995 to 13.4 million in 1996 and to 35 million by 2000,
reports research firm Jupiter Communications.  Predicted revenues from on-line
shopping will grow from $575 million in 1995 to $1.3 billion in 1996 and to
$7.3 billion by 2000.  A Jupiter spokesperson says transactions will heavily
weigh toward credit cards.
