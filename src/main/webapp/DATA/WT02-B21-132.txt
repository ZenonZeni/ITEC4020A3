&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I’ve got one!"  I hear the triumphant cry as I float near Mayotte, one of the Comoros Islands off the East African coast.  Some of us traveling on the M/V Caledonian Star during a March expedition from Zanzibar to the Seychelles have snorkeled across grassy shallows in hope of swimming among green turtles.<IMG SRC="turtle.gif" ALT="turtle.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=218 HEIGHT=200 ><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When we reach a thriving coral reef, a group clusters around marine biologist Jack Grove as he dives and identifies myriad exotic fish.  I hover nearby over the vertical drop-off.  When I hear the exultant shout, I swim diagonally out from the reef as a huge turtle streaks up from the depths and levels off a dozen feet beneath me.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Away from the flurry of human activity, she glides calmly through the sapphire waters and I swim quietly above, trying to match the rhythm of her flippers with my own.  After long moments she pauses, turns her head, and gazes toward me with one wise eye.  I pause too, and hover until she decides I pose no threat and resumes her journey.  Life has wrinkled both of our skins; algae encrust her carapace and my hair is gray.  So, as two seasoned females separated by eons of evolution, we swim in a rhythmic communion.  With fresh clarity, I understand the difference between watching a creature of a different species and truly being with one.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through a timeless interlude we swim in harmony until it occurs to me that her destination might be Africa - and my passport is on the ship!  Reluctantly, I wish her well and turn away.  As I swim back to shore, memories of the late Sir Peter Scott drift across my mind.  I dived and snorkeled with that ardent conservationist and president of the World Wildlife Fund during an Indian Ocean journey in 1986 (as it happens, the divemaster on that trip was Mike Messick.)<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How privileged we are," Sir Peter said as we clambered out of the sea after swimming with one of his favorites - the cobalt, black and yellow palette surgeonfish.  "How privileged that these beautiful creatures allow us to share their realm".<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I feel that privilege today.<BR>
