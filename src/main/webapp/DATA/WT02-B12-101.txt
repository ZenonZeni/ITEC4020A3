&gt; from Howard White
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your responses to the Campaign and Petition Against Clipper document were
&gt; &gt; good. Thank you for the attention to the topic. I'd like to ask one
&gt; &gt; question of my own. Why has the EFF seeminglly taken such a strong stand
&gt; &gt; against Clipper? <p>

[Denning replies:] <p>

&gt; Thanks for your kind words.  I don't know why really, but I speculate that
&gt; they just don't take seriously what the FBI and NSA say about law enforcement
&gt; and national security concerns.  The EFF founders have been opposing these
&gt; parts of the government since their youth.  EFF was originally started
&gt; to defend hackers against over-zealous law enforcers.
&gt;
&gt; Dorothy <p>

Hmm, well Howard, Dr. Denning, last I looked, is not an EFF spokesperson,
so I wouldn't put too much weight on her comments about what EFF does and
does not take seriously. <p>

Casting aspersions on people's allegedly wilder youths has no
relevance to current policy matters.  By such reasoning, Dr. Denning
should also be opposed to Clipper, since the head of the govt. pushing
Clipper admits to having smoked marijuana, and may have even dodged the
draft back in the hippie era. <p>

Also EFF was not founded as a hacker defense organization.  It was founded
to protect, and help define, civil liberties in the realm of computers and
telecommunications.  That some of these cases are cases of alleged system
crackers is not surprising, but it hardly indicates that EFF is limited
to, or began as, "hacker defense".  Such [lack of] logic is tatamount to
saying that the US welfare system is a Black support fund, because more
African-Americans are using it that Anglos, Asians, or Hispanics. <p>

Avoiding such diversions, and getting back to the real issue here:
for the record, EFF is indeed concerned with national security and law
enforcement, but does not see that Clipper will in any way serve legitimate
law enforcement or national security needs.  It was publicly known, right from
day one, that Clipper is tappable by LE and intelligence agencies, and
that the keys are held by govt. institutions.  Criminals, spies and
terrorists are highly unlikely to use Clipper or other Skipjack-based
"products" like Capstone and Tessera.  The "products" threaten the
viability of US businesses, as do the current crypto export regulations;
not to mention that the govt. is not in the business of being in business,
and competing in a cryptography product marketplace - the govt. is
supposed to be in the business of governing (protecting US citizens from
depradations of those that would harm their person or property, and
protecting the US from foreign invasion.) <p>

The privacy risks involved with a scheme like the Clipper EES system far
outweigh the gains for (legitmate) law enforcement and intelligence
efforts, particulary given the following: <p>

* the "authorization" required to get Clipper keys is left entirely undefined
* proof of this authorization will supposedly only be required to be *faxed*,
  leaving the entire escrow system wide open for abuse
* the algorithm is classified, and thus is not open to the public scrutiny
  necessary to see if it is adequate security, even without key escrow
* key escrow is, conceptually, no different from a requirement that police
  and spies have copies of all of your house and car keys, your computer
  passwords, and your safe combinations - key escrow is un-American and
  unconsitutional.
* the NSA, in direct countervention of the spirit, if not the word, of
  legislation prohibiting it's involvement in domestic surveillance, has
  been the primary driving force behind Clipper from the outset.
* the keys, as of the most recent White House briefings, are to be held by
  agencies that are closely related to the very law enforcement and
  intelligence bodies the split-key escrow system is supposed to protect
  users from
* any security system with a security hole (like key escrow) is, by very
  definition, insecure.  Relying upon an insecure system thought to
  be secure is often more dangerous that having little or no security (and
  being well aware of the fact, and able to plan accordingly)
* referring to "key escrow" as "escrow" at all is misleading.  A true escrow
  system would hold users keys *for the users*.  The current Clipper plans
  would hold users keys *for police and intelligence agents*.  The "key
  escrow" scheme is actually a key *surrender* scheme.
* under current Dept. of Justice regulations for obtaining escrowed keys,
  there is no mechanism in place to ensure that the keys requested are
  relevant to the case at all, belong to the person the requesting agencies
  think they do, or are destroyed after the monitoring ceases.  Furthermore,
  there is no way to enforce the cessation of monitoring after the legally
  "authorized" cut-off date, nor are any procedures in place for assuring
  that the unscrupulous do not begin building "collections" of keys,
  surrepetitiously.  Even more disturbing, though, is that possession
  of the keys allows agents to decrypt *all* communications, even from
  years past, made with that key, regardless of whether or not the
  communications are relevant to the case at hand.
* worse yet, the regulations conclude with a notice that basically says that
  *even if the key [and thus the evidence] is obtained by breaking every
  single rule of the procedure, illegally* that the evidence is still
  admissible in court.  This attempts to get around all legal restriction
  regarding what is and is not proper evidence.  Such a [lack of]
  regulation could easily subvert the entire judicial process, and make a
  mockery of the democracy this country was founded on.  This system
  dangerously sets up a system of "rules" that can be broken with impunity,
  while still allowing the rulebreaker to "win the game."  To be viable,
  the system would have to ensure that, like the rest of the
  evidence-gathering process, use of escrowed keys most be done properly for
  evidence to be admissable, and that agents and agencies that abuse the
  system are liable for their criminal behaviour.
* because only privacy-careless law abiding citizens, and very stupid
  criminals, would use Clipper, Clipper appears to be designed with
  the monitoring of non-criminals in mind.  The only way that Clipper would
  be of any use in catching the "terrorists, drug dealers, and child
  molesters" govt. spokespersons wave before the public like scarecrows
  [shades of "the Reds are coming, the Reds are coming!], would be if all
  non-key-escrow crypto is outlawed.  The Administration, today, says it
  has no plans to ban non-EES cryptographic applications.  However the
  Administration also promised a full report on the viability of Clipper, and
  instead simply announced it's intentions, despite clear majority opinion
  against Clipper, to proceed full steam ahead, with out the necessary
  legislative involvement; no report has yet been issued.  Keep in mind also
  that the Clinton Administration is unlikely to last beyond the next 3 years.
  The Admin. that follows may very well decide to ban non-Clipper crypto.
  The Administration's assurances on this matter, then, are the farthest
  thing from comforting or sufficient.  Logically, Clipper is either designed
  with the intent to rid the US of cryptography that the NSA cannot peek
  through, or it is designed for cloak-and-dagger monitoring of those who
  are not even criminals (perhaps those with unpopular religious or political
  views).  There are simply no other reasonable explanations.
* and, finally, wiretaps are not as useful to law enforcement as law
  enforcement would like people to believe.  Only about 1000, often fewer,
  wiretaps are done each year in the US.  Only a small fraction of them
  yield convictions.  Certain agencies of the govt. would like to compromise
  the privacy, security, and civil liberties of the entire populace to
  preserve one of the least-used and least-effective investigative methods
  available to law enforcement. <p>

&gt; Thanks for your answer. I've been reading books and articles about the EFF
&gt; for several years now and I've met Mitch Kapor through cyberspace so I
&gt; think my understanding of the EFF is well rounded and mature. My take on
&gt; the EFF is that the founders saw that law enforcement blundering around in
&gt; cyperspace using the current legal standards which were highly
&gt; inappropriate. The test cases have clearly shown that law enforcement has
&gt; made huge errors. The EFF has stated many times that theft and/or
&gt; distribution of passwords, credit card numbers, phone access codes, and the
&gt; like is clearly illegal. The EFF clearly wants illegal activities stopped.
&gt; But law enforcement practices that dictated total confiscation of computer
&gt; equipment that is only suppected of containing illegal information seems a
&gt; bit much. Besides, as the EFF has said, the legal costs of even proscuting
&gt; kids (hackers) for exploration and adventure is something most tax paying
&gt; citizens would blast is very waistful. If business and government can't
&gt; protect themselves against children playing around in the networks then
&gt; tough. The government does not take way a child's bike for a traffic
&gt; violation even though damage to property and lives are very much a reality.
&gt; The EFF, I think, is just trying to bring some sanity to the situation.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about the ranting. I think that it is a GOOD THING that, in your
&gt; words, the "EFF was originally started to defend hackers against
&gt; OVER-ZEALOUS law enforcers." OVER-ZEALOUS is a BAD THING in absolute terms.
&gt; Clipper seems to me to be over-zealous, because it gives absolute power to
&gt; government law enforcement agencies. Even I can easily imagine each
&gt; government law enforcement agency forming independant super secret groups
&gt; that do nothing but snoop around the net examining and acting on any
&gt; information they see. <p>

Well said, Howard!  Saved me a lot of typing! <p>

&gt; Thanks very much for your time.

&gt; &gt;I helped with the defense of one of the major cases in the beginning -
&gt; &gt;Craig Neidorf.  Later I went and interviewed some of the people in law

&gt; &gt;whereas there were indeed a few cases that were mismanaged, the vast
&gt; &gt;majority of the cases were handled extremely well in accordance with
&gt; &gt;the deeds done.  Unfortunately, that side of it never got out, so readers
&gt; &gt;on the net never heard about anything other than the few bad cases.  And
&gt; &gt;even then, some of the "facts" presented were wrong.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Dorothy <p>

Please quote us some of these '"facts"'.  If you are talking about general
Usenet chatter, well, of course some facts are wrong.  That's Usenet.  It
appears to me, however, that you imply that EFF and similar organizations
have been actively disseminating misinformation.  If that is indeed the
gist, please defend this assertion. <p>

&gt; I may have seen your name in some of the books and articles over the past
&gt; few years. Many of the errors that I'm speaking of were those in the late
&gt; eighties. Clifford Stolls story and the "Great Hacker Crackdown". It wasn't
&gt; just the errors of over-zealousness. <p>

Clifford Stoll's story had nothing to do with the EFF and related hacker
cases you are referring to, nor with Operation Sundevil.  Stoll's book
dealt with the case of a German spy working for the KGB.  Maybe it's time
you did a re-read? <p>

&gt; Getting law enforcement to pay
&gt; attention also was nearly impossible at times too. It still is. It seems as
&gt; if the government agencies have no foot soldiers and can only drop the bomb
&gt; when brought into potential computer crime cases. <p>

I don't think any of us will accept that as a valid excuse.  If the
problem is manpower, perhaps they should hire more cops, or better yet,
stop trying to prosecute people for consensual, victimless, and
perpetrator-as-sole-victim crimes.  If the problem is funding, see
previous sentence.  If the problem is ignorance of technical topics, there
are such things as books and classes. <p>

&gt; And I don't blame the government. I blame the inherent anarchy of computers
&gt; and computing. Electronic computing by its very nature is uncontrollable.
&gt; Trying to control computing technologies is just like trying to control
&gt; people's minds or trying to control people's writings. <p>

Absolutely. <p>

&gt; When you try to
&gt; control computing its only the unknowing who are hurt. The informed
&gt; computer community will know how to neutralize Clipper with other public
&gt; domain encryption standards like PGP and RIPEM. And maybe the public domain
&gt; stuff is not as tough as Clipper, none of this is really the point for me. <p>

The use of PD crypto, or any non-EES crypto, could easily be outlawed.
This is NOT a valid assurance, no matter how much the Administration likes
to pretend it is. <p>

&gt; I've seen how misunderstanding computing technologies can be the ruin of
&gt; information structures and information systems. Computers are not well
&gt; understood yet. After ten years of implementation, personal computers are
&gt; just starting to be understood by institutions and organizations. It will
&gt; be twenty years more before the general public begins to have a feel for
&gt; what computers and computing can truly do. At the same time computing has
&gt; gone from the horse'n buggy to the jet plane by comparison. And tomorrow,
&gt; users will be flying at light speed in outer space by comparison. Dec's
&gt; Alpha chip and IBM/Apple/Motarola's PowerPC will put supercomputing speeds
&gt; on the desktop. The speed of light speed limit, which was supposed to have
&gt; kicked in by now, does not seem to be slowing chip engineers down in the
&gt; least. Every eighteen months chip cycle speeds double and chip prices go
&gt; down by half. Humankind will have access to practically unlimited computer
&gt; power early in the twenty-first century.  Remember Television. How proud
&gt; are we of our low resolution video standard now. There is no need to rush
&gt; any encryption technology into place as a standard right now. <p>

That's a very rousing statement, and one I fully agree with. <p>

&gt; Most computer users don't know how to truly use what computing power they
&gt; have now. And worse, Clipper seems to establish a process which trys to
&gt; limit some aspect of the unlimitable right now. As time goes on,
&gt; governments will make it a habit of putting limits in place and fewer
&gt; citizens will even notice those limits. <p>

Yes, and the worst danger is that limits placed on future technology don't
just limit what we predict is coming; they limit all the new things we
haven't thought of yet, for generations, maybe forever. <p>

&gt; And once again human kind world
&gt; wide will experience government inefficiency and bureaucracy without even
&gt; having to thinking about it. When will governments learn they can't limit
&gt; the mind, NOR CAN GOVERNMENTS LIMIT TOOLS OF THE MIND. Governments are only
&gt; successful when they educate their people about GOOD THINGS; i.e. unlimited
&gt; computing access. Our government seems to be showing off this encryption
&gt; standard as a politically timed event for some crime bill, rather than
&gt; focusing political energy on the huge education task at hand. <p>

Here I'll have to differ with you: govt. that is truly efficient is
dangerous.  Witness Hitler's regime.  Don't confuse interference with
inefficiency. A non-interfering govt. that is inefficient is desirable.
Personally I don't think any govt. is effective or successful at
education, only at propagandizing in the name of education.  The function
of govt. is to physically protect (and, if you are not a fan of
unregulated free markets, to ensure competition, prevent monopoly, and a
few other such functions.)  Private education is almost universally more
effective that govt.-run education.  IMNERHO. <p>

&gt; The Clipper chip would be almost a petty thing if it weren't for the way in
&gt; which the FBI and NSA seem to be involved behind the scenes. I'd probably
&gt; be content to sit and watch this whole thing blow over if it weren't for
&gt; the FBI and NSA's involvement. Those two organizations could, and probably
&gt; have started wars. The NSA is really scary. Everything I've ever read about
&gt; the NSA shows it to be completely structured around secrecy. The Secret
&gt; Service, the FBI, and the CIA have had plenty of light blasting through
&gt; their cobwebs and catacombs. The NSA is a polished black sphere of solid
&gt; granite by comparison. Throughout history organizations that form around
&gt; secrecy always spoil and rot from the inside out. The government will have
&gt; its Clipper protected secrets and everyone else's Clipper protected secrets
&gt; too. Something smells fishy to me. Hell! This stinks to high heaven...
&gt; Sorry, my nose kind of got out of control there. <p>

Yes, No Such Agency's involvement is what makes the scheme dangerous,
because NSA has a lot of weight to throw around, and skeleton keys to the
chambers of the highest (phrases like "national security" and "terrorist
threat" tend to open plenty of metaphorical doors.)  If Clipper had been
cooked up entirely by Clinton and Gore, it would be a laugh, since as a
product it is doomed.  As an NSA-sponsored govt. standard, it is very much
a threat. <p>

&gt; The Clipper chip standard could itself be a very GOOD THING. Solid data and
&gt; voice security for everyone. Designed, established and implemented by the
&gt; government for the good of the public. Promoted and sold to the tax paying
&gt; citizens of country by our elected leaders... That's how things should
&gt; work! <p>

Eh...I'd disagree, personally.  Perhaps the Skipjack algorithm is secure
(which I personally doubt very seriously), but the Clipper system is a
bust, and it is not the place of our govt. to be selling us products.
That's what Viacrypt and PKP/RSADSI are for.  I certainly don't feel like
paying AGAIN for something developed with my tax dollars. <p>

&gt; But the process by which this encryption standard is being
&gt; implemented may continue on for hundreds of years. A process of a
&gt; government hastily volunteering a broad technology standard this early in
&gt; the computing age is probably not a wise thing. A process that involves
&gt; secret and semi-secret law enforcement agencies behind the scenes feels,
&gt; looks and smells like a very BAD THING.

Gotta agree with that.  I think everyone at EFF agrees with that,
