<CENTER>A Nuts-n-Bolts Plan For Appointing New Gaming<BR> Commissions and
Filling Vacancies on Old Ones</CENTER>

<A HREF="TGCAaei.html">Arthur E, Irwin</A>, President of <BR>
<A HREF="TGCA.html">Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. (TGCA)</A>
and <A HREF="tgmlaun.html">Tribal Gaming Management, Inc. (TGM)</A><BR> May
1995</H4>
<P><BR> Seven decades of business and community service have taught us the
secret of building any group for success. It's not the secret of finding the
perfect person for each job. It's the secret of blending people together who are
(as a group) most likely to become an effective team. <BR>
<BR> As we help tribes build their new Tribal Gaming Commissions, that is the
goal we recommend. And as Tribes ask us to search among candidates for
Commission membership, we often begin the process by applying a Five Point
Selection Guide that focuses on areas we consider to be most important:<BR>
<BR> (1) maturity and experience moving groups toward common goals,<BR> (2)
personal achievement as an indication of self-motivation and the ability to get
things done,<BR> (3) the ability to organize complex thoughts and express
opinions clearly,<BR> (4) a positive attitude, and<BR> (5) strong commitment
to building a better Tribal future. <BR>
<BR> Those most qualified, according to these key measures, then enter a pool
of final candidates that we draw from as we assemble our recommendations for the
Tribe's 1st Gaming Commission. <BR>
<BR> Building the right team can mean the difference between an effective &amp;
independent group contributing to successful Gaming operations, while standing
firm as a strong defender of Tribal Sovereignty; or a disorganized Commission
that obstructs an important Tribal venture.<BR>
<BR> Tribal leadership usually defines the Commission's structure by passing a
Tribal Ordinance dealing with, among other things:<BR>
<BR> &#183; the authority and responsibility of the Commission,<BR> &#183; the
number of Commission members,<BR> &#183; requirement that some (or all)
Commissioners be members of the Tribal Council,<BR> &#183; length of
appointment, and<BR> &#183; a provision for alternate members. <BR>
<BR> Next, they publish a call for candidates that includes basic requirements,
like age and Tribal membership. <BR>
<BR> Those who respond are asked to complete a long application form that
contributes to the process in several ways. First, it provides enough
information about the candidate to identify those who should be given
preliminary interviews. Second, it captures the information needed to perform a
background investigation prior to issuing each Commissioner's Gaming License.
And finally, the application itself is lengthy enough to discourage those who
are not serious candidates.<BR>
<BR> Applications are reviewed and screened for completeness as they are
received. Missing or incomplete data is flagged so that it can be provided later
if needed. About 20 candidates are invited for formal interviews.<BR>
<BR> At this point, a process begins which is much like that of building a
stone wall, a wall like those common throughout New England.<BR>
<BR> First, just as the best stones are chosen long before they are carefully
fitted into the wall, the most qualified candidates are carefully chosen using
the Five Point Selection Guide presented above. <BR>
<BR> Usually, we find more excellent candidates then the tribe needs. And, just
as the stones not used in today's wall are saved for future projects, those
talented people not asked to serve at this time, become a pool of talent that's
available for the future. Some will join the Commission at a later date. Some
will fill other key gaming positions as they become available. Some will serve
the Commission as members of the Commission Staff. <BR>
<BR> And those qualified candidates that appear most likely to work well
together right from the start ... those candidates who, as a group, possess the
ability to grapple with complex administrative and policy issues in an efficient
way ... those candidates will be the ones recommended for appointment to the 1st
Tribal Gaming Commission.<BR>
<BR> Someone with skill but light experience, for instance, might make an
excellent addition to the Commission two years from now. At that point;
Commission procedures will have been established, other Commissioners will have
gained veteran status, and the Commission may well be seeking a new generation
to lead it into the future.<BR>
<BR> Appointing the first commission, after all, is only the first step, on one
of the many paths.<BR>
<BR> One of the later steps, that can be equally important, comes when it is
time to fill a vacancy on the Commission. Often the easiest way is to find a
candidate with similar strengths (and weaknesses) as the Commissioner being
replaced. That's often the easiest way, but not usually the best.<BR>
<BR> We recommend that you focus on the opportunity to examine the group as a
whole, and re-structure the Commission (as necessary) to meet the challenges
that lie ahead.<BR>
<BR> An often rewarding approach, is to think once again about the process of
building that stone wall. Mentally remove each of the stones. Examine them one
at a time, and then fit them back together, along with the new Commissioner, as
a restructured team.<BR>
<BR> To give an example: some Commissions ask their members to become familiar
with all gaming operations, but at the same time, very familiar with one
specific area. Each Commissioner is asked to become almost an &quot;in-house
expert&quot;. <BR>
<BR> Under the kind of restructuring plan we recommend, a Commissioner who had
been a major resource when Table Games were discussed; might, for instance, be
asked to focus on the procedures to be followed by Casino Inspectors. Someone
else would be assigned to Table Games.<BR>
<BR> By introducing this kind of change, you strengthen your Commission in
three ways. First, it gains the enthusiasm and talents of the new Commissioner.
Second, seasoned Commissioners bring their experience to bear on old issues, but
from a slightly different point of view. And finally, learning is fun for most
of us, and the veteran Commissioners will probably feel a surge of motivation
and job satisfaction as they begin to explore interesting new areas. <BR>
<BR> And, of course, don't forget the advantages of cross-training. It's an old
fashioned idea, but cross-training generates new benefits wherever it's used.<BR>
