    <STRONG><H3> Restoring Ecological Balance</H3></STRONG>


     Remineralization  is regarded by a growing movement  worldwide  as
     a  blueprint  for the survival of the Earth, restoring  ecological
     balance  and, perhaps, even recreating Eden. The  remineralization
     of  forests,  farms, orchards  and  gardens with  glacial   gravel
     and   rock  dust  is nature's  way  to  regenerate  and  fertilize
     soils.

        During   an  Ice  Age, as glaciers grind rock to a  fine   dust
     over millennia,  a  fertile soil is created. Adding finely  ground
     gravel  dust to soils is a tremendous boost to organic agriculture
     and  can make it truly viable by adding up to  a  hundred elements
     and  trace  minerals  needed by all life and  by  nourishing   the
     microorganisms  in the soil, whose protoplasm is  the   basis   of
     all  living   things.  It is an alternative  to  harmful  chemical
     fertilizers and pesticides for a truly sustainable agriculture.

     <STRONG><H3>Remineralization and the Climate</H3></STRONG>


     There   is  evidence  to suggest that as forests  begin   to   die
     off  worldwide,   giving off carbon dioxide, the climate  of   the
     Earth   is  altered,  triggering  the  transition  from  the  warm
     interglacial   to   an Ice  Age. (See Newsweek  11/23/92)  We  are
     hastening  this  process   with  the  burning  of  fossil   fuels.
     Undertaking  the task of remineralization is urgent   to   restore
     our  agricultural  soils,  to  save the dying   forests   in   the
     temperate latitudes and stabilize our climate.


     <STRONG><H2>A BRIEF PERSPECTIVE</H2></STRONG>


     As   Ward   Chesworth  and  co-researchers write  in  Agricultural
     Alchemy:

     <STRONG><H3>Stones into Bread</H3></STRONG>


     "Our most optimistic expectations are no less than the realization
     of   an   old   dream:  What  will  fertilizing  with  stone  dust
     accomplish?   It  will   turn  stones into  bread...  make  barren
     regions (fruitful)  (and) feed the hungry."  Julius Hensel

    <STRONG><H3> Bread From Stones  (1894) Soil Remineralization -</H3></STRONG>

     <STRONG><H3> A Natural Fertilizer</H3></STRONG>


     The  soils of the entire world have become severely  demineralized
     by  erosion  over thousands of years. Plants require a  continuous
     intake of minerals, just as we do, and for very similar reasons  -
     calcium  to  build  structural support, iron to carry oxygen,  and
     so   on.  Plants growing on mineraldepleted soil do not get enough
     nourishment and  so become smaller, less-abundant and less  hardy,
     more  vulnerable to  the insects,  worms and fungi  that prey upon
     them.    Remineralization   causes  a   phenomenal    growth    of
     the  microorganisms   in   the  soil. It increases  the   nutrient
     intake  of plants.

     It   counters   the   effects of soil   acidity,   prevents   soil
     erosion  (just  for  that reason it would be worth  applying  rock
     dust), increases  the  storage  capacity of the  soil, contributes
     to   the  building  of precious humus complexes,  has  anti-fungal
     properties, and when you spray it on plants it repels  insects  as
     well.  The plants and trees become  highly  resistant to  insects,
     disease, frosts,  and  drought.

     Remineralization  also  enhances  and  speeds  up   the    process
     of  composting,  so  if  you  are composting  for   your   garden,
     consider putting on some rock dust.

     <STRONG><H3>For Agriculture</H3></STRONG>


     The  best  source of soil minerals is simple crushed gravel dust.

     In  1976   John Hamaker  spread gravel crusher screenings on  part
     of    his ten acres  in  Michigan. The following year, in an  area
     of  sparse rainfall  and dry summers, and with no irrigation,  his
     corn produced 65  bushels per acre, compared to yields of under 25
     from  other local farms. Moreover,  when independent analyses were
     done,  Hamaker's  corn  was found  to  contain 28% more   protein,
     47% more calcium,   57%  more phosphorous,  60% more magnesium and
     90%  more   potassium    than  the same type of  corn  grown  with
     chemical fertilizers nearby.  Don  Weaver grew 18-foot pole  beans
     on remineralized soil  (Jack  and the  Beanstalk?)  and got two to
     four  times the normal  organically grown yield.

     Alan   LePage  of Vermont grew a crop of carrots averaging   1-1/2
     feet  long. And  there  was  no insect damage to any   of    these
     crops.  Hamaker  estimates  that  on  fully  remineralized   soil,
     American agriculture could grow four times  as much food as it  is
     capable   of now  - or the same amount of food at about one-fourth
     the cost -  and with no pesticides
     or chemical fertilizers.

     <STRONG><H3>For Forests</H3></STRONG>


     The  results of long term experiments released in 1986 showed that
     in  a  forest  where pine seedlings were remineralized,  after  24
     years the wood volume was four times higher  than in the untreated
     area.  Recent remineralization  trials of a dying forest  on   Mt.
     Mitchell   by  Dr.  Robert Bruck, Ph.D.,  showed  12  weeks  after
     application  of  rock  dust, height  growth  of   red  spruce  was
     increased by 27% over  non-treated controls,  and height growth of
     Fraser fir was 19% greater  than  the untreated controls.
     (Forestry Research packet p. 9)

     The    Men    of    the  Trees  organization  in   Australia    is
     doing  remineralization  trials with  many  species  of  trees  in
     Australia  with phenomenal  results, such as five times the growth
     of  tree   seedlings  of  one  variety  of  eucalyptus,  over  the
     untreated controls. (See Forestry Research packet p.17)

     <STRONG><H3>The Nutritional Aspect</H3></STRONG>


     When   we   eat   food grown on depleted soil we  too,  like   the
     plants,   lose  our  natural  resistance  to  disease.   All   the
     degenerative  diseases  have  been  on the  rise  in  America   in
     recent  decades.   Dietary   fat, cholesterol,  salt  and  overly-
     refined   foods  seem  to  be  major   factors,  but   a   serious
     deficiency of minerals in our food may  be  another.

     Mineral   depletion  of  soils  has  been  found  to  be  directly
     correlated  with death rates. And deficiencies of only  one  of  a
     number  of   trace minerals  -  copper, iron,  selenium,  etc.   -
     have  been  found  in laboratory  studies   to  be associated with
     an   increased   risk  of cancer.  You  may   want  to  grow  more
     complete, nourishing  food  for yourself and your family.

    <STRONG><H3> A Global Perspective On Climate</H3></STRONG>


     The    problem   of  soil  demineralization  also  has  a   global
     perspective.   It   is  known  that  the  Earth's   soil   becomes
     demineralized  during  each interglacial  period,  the  relatively
     short 10,000-year  warm  period between each 90,000-year major Ice
     Age.   Consequent  decline and death of the  world's  forests  and
     other  vegetation which occurs causes great quantities  of  carbon
     dioxide  to  be  given off. The level of  carbon dioxide   in  the
     Earth's  atmosphere has been rising exponentially   for  the  past
     century.  Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases  trap  excess
     heat from the sun, potentially affecting the world's climate.

     It   is  also well-known that when the glaciers advance  and  then
     recede  during each recurrent  Ice Age, they grind down  rocks  in
     their  path,  and this mineral-rich  dust  is blown far  and  wide
     over   the   surface   of  the Earth,  remineralizing   soils  and
     causing plant life to thrive again.

     John   Hamaker  has supplied one missing piece of a cosmic  puzzle
     to provide  an explanation,  long sought, of the  awesome  100,000-
     year cycle of major Ice Ages.

     Hamaker points out that the greenhouse effect occurs primarily  in
     the  tropics, which get  the most  sun, rather  than in the  polar
     regions    which   get  very  little.  When  this  happens,    the
     temperature  differential   between  the  tropics  and  the  poles
     increases,   resulting  in  fierce  wind   systems,    hurricanes,
     tornadoes and storms. The moisture picked up  by  these increasing
     storm  systems also is transported to the higher latitudes,  where
     it   gets  deposited  as snow and ice, eventually    bringing   on
     glaciation and the next Ice Age.

       This has  been happening  in  recent years,  with  record   snow
     cover in the Northern Hemisphere  and  a shortening of the growing
     season,  by  weeks  in  some places, a  pattern  which   is   also
     accelerating year by year.  Hamaker  estimates  that within  a few
     decades  the  growing  season may have decreased   so   much  that
     millions of people will starve, in the richer nations as  well  as
     the   poorer.   Remineralization of the world's soils and  forests
     will  store   carbon   and  contribute to  climate  stability.  By
     assuming  the task  of  remineralizing the Earth's soils, much  as
     the   glaciers  do during an Ice Age, we can create fertile  soils
     and abundance.  We can re-create Eden.

     <STRONG><H2>A ROCK DUST PRIMER</H2></STRONG>


    <STRONG><H3> What Type of Rock Is Best?</H3></STRONG>


     Feeding  poor soil with mixed rock dust may be compared to feeding
     an  ill   person  a  varied diet of unrefined, natural food.    If
     no   one  single food is a panacea, it might follow that no single
     rock type is "ideal." Indeed, the virtue of glacial gravel is said
     to lie  in  its broad spectrum of rock types.

     Hamaker   advocates  the use of glacial   gravel   dust,   ideally
     followed   by  river and seashore gravels and mixtures  of  single
     rock  types. John Hamaker in the book The Survival of Civilization
     suggests finelyground  glacial gravel because that is nature's way
     throughout
     millennia  to  create  fertile soils.  Glacial  gravel,  which  is
     a  natural  mixture  of rocks, will create  a  broad  spectrum  of
     minerals in the  soil  in  a natural balance. Much of value can be
     gleaned   from  Europe  and  the  research and  experiences  there
     (where  single  rock types  and  combinations of single rock types
     are  used.)   Hamaker's approach, however, may very well offer  an
     even  greater potential  for an ecologically sustainable and sound
     agriculture and forestry.

    <STRONG><H3> Does It Need To Be a Special Kind of Gravel?</H3></STRONG>


     Again,   the   analogy  of  feeding soils  to  feeding  humans  is
     pertinent. From  simplistic  notions of human dietary requirements
     as  straight protein-fat-carbohydrate ratios, our understanding of
     specific    human   dietary   needs  has   grown   to   staggering
     sophistication and complexity, and we are now learning  that  what
     we don't know may exceed what we do.

       Similarly,  we  have come a long way from the simple  NPK  idea.
     But  no  amount  of controlled  research has conclusively told  us
     (or   likely will  ever tell us) precisely which minerals specific
     plants really need and  in what precise proportion.

     The   attempt to second-guess nature in all her complexity is sure
     to  be  a  futile and perpetual game of catch-up.  Hamaker asserts
     that:  "Microorganisms select what they need to make the compounds
     of   life, and  reject  to  the subsoil what is not needed,  [such
     as]   aluminum, silicon, iron, etc., which are generally in excess
     [in  gravel dust]," further pointing to "the  Kervran research  on
     biological   transmutations",  which   suggests  that   biological
     organisms   may  play  an  active  role not   only   in  selecting
     specific elements, but also in modulating their
     elemental  nature  to  create needed materials where they  are  in
     short supply.

     Hamaker  says: As long as the soil is neutral [in pH] or close  to
     it,  microorganisms will control what goes into the  plant  roots.
     These  controls are off  when the soil is acid or acidic chemicals
     are added.

     <STRONG><H3>Composting With Rock Dust</H3></STRONG>


     Combining   gravel dust with organic materials in  compost  is   a
     great  way   to   solve  application problems  and  speed  up  the
     process.   Don't  forget   a  handful of soil  to  inoculate  with
     organisms.   Gravel  dust improves  aeration  and   structure  and
     therefore  prevents  rotting. Gravel dust is assimilated even more
     quickly  in  compost than in poor soils. Compost and gravel   dust
     are    a   symbiotic   combination:   the  compost  provides    an
     excellent  medium   for  the "microorganism population  explosion"
     promoted  by  the dust,  and  the  gravel dust will not only  help
     create   more organic matter,  but  will  also  help  hold  it  in
     place,  reduce  odors  and conserve it. Add 2-20 lb. of rock  dust
     per  cubic  yard  of  compost,  if one is  doing  pile  or  window
     composting.

     <STRONG><H3>Soil Acidity</H3></STRONG>


     Soil   pH   should   be  measured  annually.  If   the   soil   is
     acidic,  agricultural  limestone may be added  together  with  the
     rock   dust   to bring  the soil pH to neutral. Gravel  dust  will
     also  neutralize  soils to  a  great degree, but  limestone  is  a
     quick remedy for agricultural soils.  Limestone is not recommended
     for  forests as it  will  destroy the humus-building complex  over
     the long term.

     <STRONG><H3>Keep Insects In Natural Balance In Your Garden</H3></STRONG>


     For  short-term rescue, very fine  dust sprayed directly on plants
     and  trees  has  been  shown  in  research  in  Germany  to  deter
     insect  infestations very effectively. Trails of rock dust  around
     the   garden  help   keep   slugs out. And  healthy  remineralized
     plants  will  not  be plagued by insect infestations in  the  long
     term.

    <STRONG><H3> How To Apply Gravel Dust</H3></STRONG>


     There   are many ways to apply dust to the soil; which method  you
     use  depends  on the scale and your preference.  It can be  spread
     by   hand out  of  a  wheelbarrow, or roto-tilled and disked   in.
     Farmer   John Sundquist applies it with a manure spreader,  bander
     or  an "E-Z  Flow" type  fertilizer applicator. He also uses  rock
     dust in a potting soil made of compost, ashes and peat moss.

     <STRONG><H3> How Much To Use</H3></STRONG>


     A  grower  of crops or a gardener needs a good response the  first
     year   after  a  fall application.  The response in any  one  year
     depends   on    the   amount   of   minerals  available   to   the
     microorganisms,   soil moisture and the amount  of  inert  organic
     matter.

          If the last two factors are satisfactory, as little as 3 tons
     of  gravel  dust  per acre worked into the top 4  inches  of  soil
     should  give good  results.  However, I prefer about 10  tons  per
     acre   worked   in  about   8 inches, since one  application  will
     eliminate the cost  of  a number of more frequent applications and
     give high yields.

     The   Application Conversion chart (shown in magazine)  will  help
     you  to   determine  how  much gravel dust to use:   3  tons   per
     acre  is considered  the  minimum  application,  10  tons/acre  is
     Hamaker's  preferred long-term application, and  20  tons/acre  is
     given as a major
     remedial  application,  for especially  dry,  poor  soil.  Smaller
     amounts are recommended if the rock dust is finer than 200 mesh.

     Sources   of rock dust as a natural fertilizer and soil  amendment
     are  available   from local sand and gravel  quarries,  and  there
     are   many products  available on the market. Costs at a sand  and
     gravel   quarry  vary    from  $1-8./ton.   Specially   formulated
     products   are   more expensive   but  often  more  effective  and
     easy   to   apply.    See Remineralize the Earth magazine for  the
     latest   information  on  sources  in  your   area   and   product
     availability.
