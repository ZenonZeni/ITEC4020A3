<H3><A NAME="A2"><B>1. MANAGEMENT PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The Management Plan should contain a clear and concise overview of the work scope
necessary for completion of Phases B and C. It should describe the project management
organization and explain the allocation of all work between the RSA and all of its subcontractors
with delineating lines of authority, identify all key personnel, identify and describe the facilities
where the work will be performed, and identify all necessary special hardware, materials, and
processes required to perform the work scope and explain how these items will be provided. The
Plan should identify all of the technical support disciplines to be employed with their related
responsibilities including specialty skills required and sources of qualified personnel. The Plan
should contain a description of all administrative support systems and controls that will be used
to manage the execution of the work scope within the milestone schedule including a description
of all management plans and reports that will be used. The Plan should contain a master schedule
and a detailed milestone schedule with key decision points, delivery dates for major deliverables,
planned management and design reviews, presentations, audits, key events and all hold points. It
must include a Monthly Status Report as a deliverable. It should identify all applicable programs
to be used in contract performance, such as Quality Assurance, configuration management,
Purchaser/Federal Facility Operator interface, manufacturing process control, etc. <P>
<H3><A NAME="A3"><B>2. SUBCONTRACT PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The Subcontract Plan should identify all subcontractors and describe their respective work
scopes identifying their functional areas of responsibility and services and deliverables to be
supplied, places of performance and schedules of subcontractor activities. The Plan should
require that each subcontractor performing work subject to the controls of the QARD work under
a QA program and a QA plan that cover the subcontractor's specific work scope which have been
reviewed and accepted in writing by the RSA prior to start of work. The Plan should also provide
that the RSA include in its subcontracts provisions for flow down of QA requirements to all
lower-tier subcontractors performing work subject to the controls of the OCRWM QARD;
identification of test and inspection activities and hold/witness points; advance notification of all
hold/witness points; reporting of defects and non-compliance; and access to facilities and records
for verification of QA compliance. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A4"><B>3. PURCHASER SITE SERVICE PLANS</B></A></H3> <P>
The Purchaser Site Service Plans shall contain all of the planning information necessary in
sufficient detail to support preparation for and performance of the required waste acceptance and
transportation activities required to meet DOE's commitment under the Purchasers' Disposal
Contracts. The Plans should identify:
<P><DL><DD> - all RSA and Purchaser interface requirements to include transportation
servicing capabilities on-site (truck, rail, barge, heavy haul, etc), <BR><DD> - preliminary
transportation routes to include near-utility-site intermodal transfer sites (if intermodal service is
required),
<BR><DD> - facilities requirements, limitations and constraints related to cask handling and
loading operations,
<BR><DD> - improvements to Purchaser sites which would remove cask handling and loading
limitations and constraints and would result in a lower price, <BR><DD> - types of transport and
transfer casks, ancillary equipment and special tools needed to accept and transport the SNF
off-site, and
<BR><DD> - all on-site services (power, compressed air, etc) required to support the operations.
<P></DL> The Plans should further identify the characteristics of the SNF and other materials
such as non-fuel assembly hardware and channelsto be accepted and transported and discuss the
records and documentation needed to complete the operations. The Plans should contain
schedules for each campaign with all significant milestones and key events, and the critical path
should be identified in each schedule. Finally, the Plans should delineate responsibilities for the
RSA and the Purchasers, e.g. the RSA shall provide the transportation hardware and canisters,
transportation services, training, etc., and the Purchaser will perform the cask handling, loading,
decontamination, preparation for shipment, etc.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A5"><B>4. REGIONAL SERVICING PLAN</B></A></H3> <P> The
Regional Servicing Plan, for each region, should be a consolidated and integrated plan
incorporating all of the region's Purchaser Site Service Plans and requirements and schedules
therein, describing the regional operations for waste acceptance and transportation, and
describing all of the mobilization and logistics activities required to establish and start up
operations. The Plan should include campaign schedules with the specific details of each
campaign, identification of planned shipping routes and en route intermodal sites to be used,
identify quantities of SNF by type to be accepted and transported by campaign, and identify and
quantify operating fleet requirements for transportation cask systems by type by operating year.
The Plan should identify those transportation services required for each campaign (truck, rail,
barge, intermodal, heavy haul, etc.). The Regional Servicing Plan should contain the routing
information and schedules related to the planned campaigns as attachments that can be readily
removed from the Plan for distribution to authorized state, local and tribal officials. <P> The plan
shall identify all time-phased requirements for transportation and storage related hardware items,
structures, systems and components, to include canisters and storage modules, and all
transportation and intermodal services. Based on the time-phased requirements, the RSA shall
develop the regional operating fleet requirements by year, e.g., how many dual-purpose systems,
transport-only casks, SNF canisters, storage modules, etc., by type and other systems or
components that will be needed to support each year of operation.  <P> The Regional Servicing
Plan shall contain a section that describes the RSA's plans for acquiring all of the resources and
assembling the organizational capabilities required for performance of the Phase B and Phase C
work scope. This section of the Plan shall describe all of the responsible organizations and their
assigned work scope, logistical approach to establishing the operating organization, staffing,
communications, training, development of training, maintenance and operating procedures and
manuals to be delivered under the contract, acquisition of transportation and cask maintenance
services, etc. Additionally, the plan will explain how the resources will be integrated and
assembled and how the operations will be started up.
<P> The plan shall also explain how the RSA will perform its communication and coordination
responsibilities and its participation in quarterly coordination meetings. <P>
<H3><A NAME="A6"><B>5. ACQUISITION PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The RSA's Acquisition Plan should identify and describe all significant subcontracting
initiatives planned for the procurement of hardware items, software, and services to meet the
annual Regional Servicing Plan requirements. Additionally, the plan should identify planned
sources of supply, clearly describe contractual relationships between subcontractors and lower
tier subcontractors, indicate the locations where the work will be performed for each subcontract
and lower tier subcontract, and provide estimates of the value of each subcontract, and an
estimate of the relative magnitude of the work effort to be performed under each subcontract and
lower tier subcontract. The plan should incorporate a master schedule reflecting the timing of all
subcontracting initiatives to include key milestones and activities, with all critical path activities
clearly identified.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A7"><B>6. QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN</B></A></H3> <P> The
RSA's QA Plan shall identify those activities to be performed by the RSA that are subject to the
controls of OCRWM's QARD, the QA procedures and instructions that will be followed to
control those work activities and the individuals responsible for the performance of the work
being controlled under the QA Program. Secondly, the QA Plan shall identify all subcontractors
and lower tier subcontractors performing work subject to the controls of the QARD for the RSA,
identify the specific work being performed by each subcontractor and lower tier subcontractor,
identify what QA program each of the subcontractors and lower tier subcontractors will be using
to control their work and identify the individuals responsible for the performance of the work
being controlled under the applicable QA Programs.  <P>
<H3><A NAME="A8"><B>7. INSTITUTIONAL PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The Institutional Plan developed by the RSA shall describe the type and extent of public
involvement activities to be conducted to facilitate the timely and cost-effective shipment of
spent fuel. These activities shall include: information dissemination to the public, State, local and
Tribal officials, other Federal agencies, and the media; preparation of and technical support for
exhibit materials on RSA operations and transportation; participation in and/or conduct of
meetings, public forums, and training drills and exercises; emergency communications;
operational communications (e.g. routing, prenotification, inspections); and schedules identifying
key milestones and special events.
<P> The Plan should provide for the RSA to coordinate institutional activities with the other
RSAs, as required, for consistency and to avoid dissemination of conflicting or confusing
information; and to establish and maintain communications with the other RSAs, the Federal
Facility Operator and OCRWM for the purpose of ensuring that these organizations are cognizant
of the status of the overall program activities and any problems or issues that may affect their
operations..
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A9"><B>8. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA AND ANALYSES
REPORT</B></A></H3>
<P> This report shall describe the foreseeable direct and indirect environmental impacts resulting
from the implementation of the activities to be conducted under Phases B and C.The activities
shall include the acquisition of required transportation hardware items, structures, and other
systems (such as casks, casks/canisters, and transportable storage casks), and the handling,
transport and storage of spent nuclear fuel. Potential impact areas shall include air quality,
surface and ground water, safety and health, physical and biological resources, waste generation,
noise levels, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and land use. <P> Environmental data provided
