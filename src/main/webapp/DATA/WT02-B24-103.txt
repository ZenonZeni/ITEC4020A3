<h4>Beginnings of school-based management</h4>

<p>American schools in the 1950s and decades following searched for
&quot;equality of 
opportunity.&quot; Although living in America became increasingly complex with 
fundamental changes occurring in the American family and society in general, 
schools were made responsible for educating a greater range of students than 
ever before. In special education, for example, in the 1970s, students were 
brought into the public schools who had never been allowed previous 
enrollment.

<p>Between the 1950s and 1980s the focus of public attention gradually began to 
shift from equality to concern for greater productivity from schools. The 
public was bombarded with stories about failures of the public school system. 
Schools found themselves responsible for all children and, at the same time, 
the recipients of an unprecedented demand for &quot;excellence in
education.&quot; During the 1980-81 school year the writer was teaching a
special education class for severe emotionally disturbed children at a
typical elementary school in Fort Worth, Texas. The students were bused
to the school from all over the district because of the severity of their
disabilities.

<p>As part of a district-wide pilot program, this school was involved in an 
effort to get more parental involvement, more parental &quot;say so&quot;
in the school. The principal selected several teachers to work with
parent leaders on a &quot;school management team&quot; which met at least
once a month. The principal invited other faculty members to attend the
meetings to promote awareness. A few teachers elected to attend the
meetings, mostly out of a sense of curiosity to see if some of the rumors
were correct.

<p>Some of the parents began to take pads and pencils into classrooms, making 
notes about strategies and methods being used by individual teachers in 
instruction, discipline, and other aspects of daily routine. Some of the 
parents took rather vocal exception to a few of the things they reported. A 
number of the meetings, especially in the beginning, were hostile, divisive, 
and marked by defensive stances on the part of school personnel. Attendance at 
those meetings was the very first exposure for some of us to the latest fad 
coming down from on high -- parental involvement and participatory management. 
I remember retreating to the safety of my self-contained special education 
class, grateful that no members of the management team were selected from my 
classroom.

<p>Reform received impetus in April, 1983, with the release of <cite>A
Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform</cite>. This
document, prepared by the National Commission on Excellence in Education,
represented a &quot;report card&quot; on educational quality in America.
Created because of the public outcry for reform, <cite>A
Nation at Risk</cite> codified the status of American education:

<ul>
  <li>American students fared poorly when compared with students from
other nations,
  <li>millions of American were functionally illiterate,
  <li>standardized test scores were lower,
  <li>achievement of gifted students was not commensurate with expectancy,
  <li>Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores were declining overall,
  <li>highest SAT scores were lower,
  <li>students were unable to demonstrate &quot;high level thinking
skills,&quot;
  <li>scores on measures of science and math were lower,
  <li>achievement scores of college graduates were lower, and
  <li>business and the military complained they were having to spend
millions of dollars to remediate their employees or recruits.
</ul>
<p>
Recommendations to improve the sorry state of American education included 
increased graduation requirements, stringent and more demanding assessments, 
more instructional time devoted to the &quot;basics,&quot; and far more
rigorous teacher training. The final recommendation was one of
accountability--educators and elected officials were made responsible for
educational improvement and reform.

<p>The prevailing popular thought during this time was that excellence could be 
achieved by a series of top-down mandates including implementation of merit 
pay, career ladders, mentoring programs, more stringent graduation 
requirements, restrictions of extracurricular activities for poor academic 
performance, denial of  driver's licenses for school dropouts, exit tests, 
etc. Research suggested, however, that excellence in teaching and learning 
proved to be elusive. Reforms left teaching and learning either unaffected or 
negatively affected by these efforts (cited by Midgley and Wood, 1993).
In 1985 the writer was named principal at a school which served two distinct 
minority populations - Hispanic and southeast Asian. Each group made up 
approximately one-quarter of the total population of students. The school had 
a history of high achievement which had fallen in recent times.

<p>Texas had responded to the reform movement with a vast array of edicts and 
mandates covering everything from the numbers of minutes of instruction for 
various subjects taught in school to site-adopted frameworks and curricula, 
instructional strategies, student grouping, methodology, and the like. 
Achievement was to be measured by statistics on dropouts, attendance, and 
state-wide tests whose results were published in the newspapers and were to be 
used to compare schools and their efforts at &quot;excellence.&quot;

<p>Site-based management was also being mandated in the district. From the 
beginning, management teams were composed of both teachers and parents. Both 
were now to be elected from their constituent groups. The success or failure 
of the teams appeared to be contingent on the make-up of the team, and, most 
importantly, upon the willingness of the principal to share decision-making. 
There was little training provided. Principals were guided by a written report 
which included how the members were to be selected, etc.

<p>My first management teams were used as advisory boards to help make
decisions which would affect the entire school. I had begun my
administration by implementing collaborative decision-making with the
teachers. It made sense that if you wanted teachers to do something, and
to do it well, you had to give teachers not only the responsibility but
also the need to make it succeed. Teachers would have to &quot;buy
in&quot; to what they were doing if they were to really devote themselves,
their time and energy to success! It also made sense that parents would
have to have some &quot;buy in.&quot; We had little parental  involvement
at their school in terms of numbers, but those who became involved were
dedicated and insightful in their recognition of problems and search for 
solutions.

<p>With strong support from the teachers and management team we began such 
innovations at the school as a volunteer program to teach English to parents 
(&quot;hooking&quot; the parents into coming under the guise of teaching
them to help their children with homework). The students actually began
to tutor their parents in speaking and reading English. Written
communications were sent from the school, whenever possible, in Lao as
well as English and Spanish. All teachers were required to obtain
endorsements in instruction of English as Second Language (ESL).

<p>Our program for limited English proficient (LEP) students was total English 
immersion--non-English speakers were placed in their age-level peer classrooms 
regardless of their English-speaking ability. A modified Joplin plan was 
followed whereby students went all over the school to have their reading and 
math instruction. It was not uncommon for students from a fourth grade 
homeroom to have reading in a first or second grade room with mathematics at 
the fourth grade level. Older students in younger classrooms were called 
&quot;assistants,&quot; and they were allowed to progress as slowly or as
quickly as they needed to master components of the curriculum. While
other schools in the district were doing away with reading levels and
reading level assessments, we were using them to measure relative
strengths and weaknesses, to advance students, and to reteach until
mastery was attained.

<p>As a result of changes supported by the management team, gains in English 
acquisition and scores on state-wide tests were documented. The school 
received recognition from the National Council of Teachers of English as a 
&quot;site of excellence in language arts instruction&quot; as a result
of the writing process implementation and concomitant achievement.

<p>In 1986 the Carnegie Forum published a report, <cite>A Nation
Prepared</cite>. This report called for &quot;restructuring&quot; schools
in order to provide a professional environment for teachers (cited in
O'Neil, 1990). With the advent of this publication, nay-sayers were
already dooming  recommendations put into place as a result of the
earlier A Nation at Risk. In 1990 the National Governors Association
issued a report, Results in Education: 1989 which provided a   
&quot;framework&quot; for &quot;restructuring&quot; (cited in O'Neil,
1990). Included in the framework were the following:
<ul>
   <li>Curriculum and instruction. More instruction in higher-order
thinking skills, flexible time usage, challenging and engaging
instructional activities, grouping promoting student
interaction and cooperation.

   <li>Authority and decision making. Decentralization to allow teachers,
parents, and administrators to determine the direction of education at a
school site as well as instructional organization, strategies, and
arrangements.

   <li>New staff roles. Principals to provide vision and leadership to
encourage teachers in taking risk, to reward their efforts; teachers to
work collegially to improve instruction, plan/develop new curriculum, 
design/implement professional development.

   <li>Accountability systems. Building-level consequences for student
performance, schools develop measures to assess performance outcomes.
</ul>

<p>With the two-pronged thrust for change and reform, a strange
&quot;wash&quot; occurred in education. School-based management became
intertwined almost irrevocably with &quot;restructuring.&quot; One way to
demonstrate what happened is perhaps to visualize restructuring as a
great canopied tree in midsummer into which a vine, school-based
management, has proved so invasive that an observer looking 
at the tree cannot differentiate its leaves from those of the vine.

<p>The definition of restructuring became confused. To some,
restructuring implies fundamental reform, changes in curriculum and
instruction, changes in school organization and administration, provision
of supportive work environment for teachers, business-to-school and
school-to-school partnerships and networks, and increased parental
involvement. This, however, is not the prevailing view of restructuring.
For many, restructuring means shared governance, &quot;School-based
management is the reform&quot; (Midgley and Wood, 1993).
