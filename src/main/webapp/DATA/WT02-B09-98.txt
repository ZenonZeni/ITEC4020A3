<h2 align=center>Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking 
<br>Fact Sheet </h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a major
assessment of the respiratory health risks of passive smoking (Respiratory
Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders; EPA/600/6-90/006F).
The report concludes that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
-- commonly known as secondhand smoke -- is responsible for approximately
3,000 lung cancer deaths each year in nonsmoking adults and impairs the
respiratory health of hundreds of thousands of children. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor
levels of many pollutants often are significantly higher than outdoor levels.
These levels of indoor air pollutants are of particular concern because
it is estimated that most people spend approximately 90 percent of their
time indoors. </p>

<p>In recent years, comparative risk studies performed by EPA and its Science
Advisory Board have consistently ranked indoor air pollution among the
top five environmental risks to public health. EPA, in close cooperation
with other federal agencies and the private sector, has begun a concerted
effort to better understand indoor air pollution and to reduce peoples'
exposure to air pollutants in offices, homes, schools and other indoor
environments where people live, work and play. </p>

<p>Tobacco smoking has long been recognized as a major cause of death and
disease, responsible for an estimated 434,000 deaths per year in the United
States. Tobacco use is known to cause lung cancer in humans, and is a major
risk factor for heart disease. </p>

<p>In recent years, there has been concern that non-smokers may also be
at risk for some of these health effects as a result of their exposure
( passive smoking&quot;) to the smoke exhaled by smokers and smoke given
off by the burning end of cigarettes. As part of its effort to address
all types of indoor air pollution, in 1988, EPA's Indoor Air Division requested
that EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) undertake an assessment
of the respiratory health effects of passive smoking. The report was prepared
by ORD's Office of Health and Environmental Assessment. </p>

<p>The document has been prepared under the authority of Title IV of Superfund
(The Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986), which directs
EPA to conduct research and disseminate information on all aspects of indoor
air quality. </p>

<h3>Public and Scientific Reviews</h3>

<p>A draft of this assessment was released for public review in June 1990.
In December 1990, EPA's Science Advisory Board, a committee of independent
scientists, conducted a review of the draft report and submitted its comments
to the EPA Administrator in April 1991. In its comments, the SAB's Indoor
Air Quality/Total Human Exposure Committee concurred with the primary findings
of the report, but made a number of recommendations for strengthening it.
</p>

<p>Incorporating these recommendations, the Agency again transmitted a
new draft to the SAB in May of 1992 for a second review. Following a July
1992 meeting, the SAB panel endorsed the major conclusions of the report,
including its unanimous endorsement of the classification of environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) as a Group A (known human) carcinogen. </p>

<p>EPA also received and reviewed more than 100 comments from the public,
and integrated appropriate revisions into the final risk assessment. </p>

<h3>Major Conclusions</h3>

<p>Based on the weight of the available scientific evidence, EPA has concluded
that the widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the U.S.
presents a serious and substantial public health risk. </p>

<p><b>In adults:</b> </p>

<p>ETS is a human lung carcinogen, responsible for approximately 3,000
lung cancer deaths annually in U.S. nonsmokers. ETS has been classified
as a Group A carcinogen under EPA's carcinogen assessment guidelines. This
classification is reserved for those compounds or mixtures which have been
shown to cause cancer in humans, based on studies in human populations.
</p>

<p><b>In children:</b> </p>

<p>ETS exposure increases the risk of lower respiratory tract infections
such as bronchitis and pneumonia. EPA estimates that between 150,000 and
300,000 of these cases annually in infants and young children up to 18
months of age are attributable to exposure to ETS. Of these, between 7,500
and 15,000 will result in hospitalization. </p>

<p>ETS exposure increases the prevalence of fluid in the middle ear, a
sign of chronic middle ear disease. </p>

<p>ETS exposure in children irritates the upper respiratory tract and is
associated with a small but significant reduction in lung function. </p>

<p>ETS exposure increases the frequency of episodes and severity of symptoms
in asthmatic children. The report estimates that 200,000 to 1,000,000 asthmatic
children have their condition worsened by exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke. </p>

<p>ETS exposure is a risk factor for new cases of asthma in chuldren who
have not previously displayed symptoms. </p>

<h3>Scope of the Report</h3>

<p>In 1986, the National Research Council (NRC) and the U.S. Surgeon General
independently assessed the health effects of exposure to ETS. Both of these
reports concluded that ETS can cause lung cancer in adult non-smokers and
that children of parents who smoke have increased frequency of respiratory
symptoms and lower respiratory tract infections. The EPA scientific assessment
builds on these reports and is based on a thorough review of all of the
studies in the available literature. </p>

<p>Since 1986, the number of studies which examine these issues in human
populations has more than doubled, resulting in a larger database with
which to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the potential effects which
passive smoking may have on the respiratory health of adults as well as
children. </p>

<p>Because only a very small number of studies on the possible association
between exposure to secondhand smoke and heart disease and other cancers
existed in the scientific literature at the time this assessment was first
undertaken, EPA has not conducted an assessment of the possible association
of heart disease and passive smoking. EPA is considering whether such an
assessment should be undertaken in the future, but has no plans to do so
at this time. </p>

<h3>Scientific Approach</h3>

<p>EPA reached its conclusions concerning the potential for ETS to act
as a human carcinogen based on an analysis of all of the available data,
including more than 30 epidemiologic (human) studies looking specifically
at passive smoking as well as information on active or direct smoking.
In addition, EPA considered animal data, biological measurements of human
uptake of tobacco smoke components and other available data. The conclusions
were based on what is commonly known as the total weight-of-evidence&quot;
rather than on any one study or type of study. </p>

<p>The finding that ETS should be classified as a Group A carcinogen is
based on the conclusive evidence of the dose-related lung carcinogenicity
of mainstream smoke in active smokers and the similarities of mainstream
and sidestream smoke given off by the burning end of the cigarette. The
finding is bolstered by the statistically significant exposure-related
increase in lung cancer in nonsmoking spouses of smokers which is found
in an analysis of more than 30 epidemiology studies that examined the association
between secondhand smoke and lung cancer. </p>

<p>The weight-of-evidence analysis for the noncancer respiratory effects
in children is based primarily on a review of more than 100 studies, including
50 recent epidemiology studies of children whose parents smoke. </p>

<h3>Beyond the Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>Although EPA does not have any regulatory authority for controlling
ETS, the Agency expects this report to be of value to other health professionals
and policymakers in taking appropriate steps to minimize peoples' exposure
to tobacco smoke in indoor environments. </p>

<p>In cooperation with other government agencies, EPA will carry out an
education and outreach program over the next two years to inform the public
and policy makers on what to do to reduce the health risks of ETS as well
as other indoor air pollutants. </p>
