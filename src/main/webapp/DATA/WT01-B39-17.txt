<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986</b> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview of America's Habit </h2>

<p>This is the final report from President's Commission on
Organized Crime. It contains material on the nature, scope and
extent of organized crime, particularly as it relates to drug
trafficking, money laundering, and labor racketeering. </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime was established
by Executive Order 12435 July 28, 1983. The Executive Order
directs the Commission to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Make a full and complete national and region-by-region
        analysis of organized crime; </li>
    <li>Define the nature of traditional organized crime as well
        as emerging organized crime groups, the sources and
        amounts of organized crime's income, and the uses to
        which organized crime puts its income; </li>
    <li>Develop in-depth information on the participants in
        organized crime networks; </li>
    <li>Evaluate Federal laws pertinent to the effort to combat
        organized crime; </li>
    <li>Advise the President and the Attorney General with
        respect to its findings and actions which can be
        undertaken to improve law enforcement efforts directed
        against organized crime; </li>
    <li>Make recommendations concerning appropriate
        administrative and legislative improvements and
        improvements in the administration of justice; </li>
</ul>

<p>and </p>

<ul>
    <li>Report to the President from time to time as requested,
        and to submit its final report by March 1, 1986. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission is authorized to issue subpoenas for the
testimony of witnesses and the production of information, to
issue orders compelling testimony over a claim of the privilege
against self-incrimination, and to seek the assistance of the
Department of Justice in applying for writs of habeas corpus ad
testificandum or judicial orders requiring testimony or the
production of information before the Commission. In addition, the
Commission may obtain, use, and disclose electronic surveillance
data obtained by law enforcement agencies under Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and other
information from Federal departments and agencies under the Bank
Secrecy Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as well as from
financial institutions under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. </p>

<p>In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Commission has
prepared this report on organized crime's role in drug
trafficking and drug abuse. Based on the totality of the evidence
before it, the Commission has concluded that drug trafficking and
abuse together constitute the single most serious organized crime
issue confronting this Nation. </p>

<p>Therefore, in contrast to the other subjects covered in the
remainder of it's final report, this topic is treated in a
separate volume. The research and drafting on this report was
performed on the Commission's behalf by Chief Investigator Manuel
Gonzalez (FBI). Research assistants Abigail Johnson and Mary
Karol, Deputy Counsel Kevin McEnery, Investigator Thomas Sheehan
(DEA), and Contract Consultant Susan Mellody, under the
supervision of Deputy Executive Director Rodney G. Smith. </p>
