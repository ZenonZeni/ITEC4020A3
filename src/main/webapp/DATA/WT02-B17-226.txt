<h2>
Energy Efficient Lighting
</h2>
The quantity and quality of light around us determine how well
we see, work, and play. Light affects our health, safety, morale,
comfort, and productivity.
<P>
Lighting also directly affects our economy. As a nation, we spend
about one-quarter of our electricity budget on lighting, or more
than $37 billion annually. Yet much of this expense is unnecessary.
Technologies developed during the past 10 years can help us cut
lighting costs 30% to 60% while enhancing lighting quality and
reducing environmental impacts.
<P>
This publication is an introduction to lighting technology and
discusses how you can save energy while maintaining good light
quality and quantity. Specifically, you will learn about:
<MENU>
<LI>Lighting principles and definitions
<LI>Types of lighting and how each works
<LI>Energy-efficient lighting options, including daylighting,
for new or retrofit applications.
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
<B>Lighting Principles and Terms</B> 
<P>
To choose the best lighting options, you should understand basic
lighting terms. This section explains terminology used in the
industry, which will help you better understand the potentially
confusing language you could hear in a lighting store.
<P>
<B>Illumination</B> 
<P>
A lumen is a measurement of light output from a lamp, often called
a tube or a bulb. All lamps are rated in lumens. For example,
a 100-watt incandescent lamp produces about 1750 lumens.
<P>
The distribution of light on a horizontal surface is called its
illumination. Illumination is measured in footcandles. A footcandle
of illumination is a lumen of light distributed over a 1-square-foot
(0.09-square-meter) area.
<P>
The amount of illumination required varies according to the difficulty
of a visual task. Ideal illumination is the minimum footcandles
necessary to allow you to perform a task comfortably and proficiently
without eyestrain. The Illuminating Engineering Society says
that illumination of 30 to 50 footcandles is adequate for most
home and office work. Difficult and lengthy visual tasks--like
sewing for extended periods of time--require 200 to 500 footcandles.
Where no seeing tasks (i.e., tasks whose speed and accuracy of
completion are affected by quality and quantity of light) are
performed, lighting systems need to provide only security, safety,
or visual comfort&Ntilde;requiring from 5 to 20 footcandles of
illumination.
<P>
Another lighting term you will hear is efficacy. This is the ratio
of light output from a lamp to the electric power it consumes
and is measured in lumens per watt (LPW).
<P>
<B>Lighting Uses</B> 
<P>
Experts divide lighting uses into three categories: ambient, task,
and accent lighting. Ambient lighting provides security and safety,
as well as general illumination for performing daily activities.
The goal of task lighting is to provide enough illumination so
that tasks can be completed accurately but not provide so much
light that entire areas are illuminated. Accent lighting illuminates
walls so they blend more closely with naturally bright areas like
ceilings and windows.
<P>
<B>Light Quality</B> 
<P>
Light quality describes how well people in a lighted space can
see to do visual tasks and how visually comfortable they feel
in that space. Light quality is important to energy efficiency
because spaces with higher quality lighting need less illumination.
High-quality lighting is fairly uniform in brightness and has
no glare.
<P>
For example, direct intense sunlight streaming through the windows
of a room with chocolate brown carpets and dark wall paneling
will likely give too much contrast in brightness. The pupils of
your eyes will constantly adjust to the differing brightnesses.
Making this area visually comfortable would involve using lots
of artificial lighting with a high illumination level.
<P>
On the other hand, in a pale-colored room bathed in soft light,
you can hardly tell where the light is coming from because no
one area of the room appears much brighter than another. The walls,
ceiling, floor, and work surfaces are relatively the same light
hue. People can perform tasks faster and with fewer mistakes with
this type of high-quality lighting. Also, lighting such a room
requires far less artificial lighting than the previous example.
<P>
<B>Glare</B> 
<P>
Eliminating glare (i.e., excessive brightness from a direct light
source) is essential to achieving good lighting quality. Types
of glare include direct glare, reflected glare, and veiling reflections.
<P>
Direct glare results from strong light from windows or bright
lamps shining directly into your eyes. Reflected glare is caused
by strong light from windows or lamps that is reflected off a
shiny surface into your eyes. Veiling reflection is a special
type of reflected glare that can obscure contrasts and reduce
task clarity. Veiling reflections occur when light is reflected
into your eyes from a work surface, such as a printed page or
a computer screen.
<P>
<B>Light Color and Color Rendering</B> 
<P>
Lamps are assigned a color temperature (according to the Kelvin
temperature scale) based on their &quot;coolness&quot; or &quot;warmness.&quot;
The human eye perceives colors as cool if they are at the blue-green
end of the color spectrum, and warm if they are at the red end
of the spectrum.
<P>
Cool light is preferred for visual tasks because it produces higher
contrast than warm light. Contrast is the brightness difference
between different parts of the visual field, which is the expanse
of space you can see at a given instant without moving your eyes.
Warm light is preferred for living spaces because it is more flattering
to skin tones and clothing.
<P>
Keep in mind, though, that artificial light sources vary widely
in their color rendering indexes (CRI). The CRI is a measurement
of a light source's ability to render colors the same as sunlight
does. For example, incandescent lamps are rated at a CRI of 100&Ntilde;nearly
equal to sunlight&Ntilde;while some high-pressure sodium lamps
have a CRI of 22, which means they render colors very poorly.
<P>
However, a light's color-rendering ability is not related to whether
it is a cool or warm color. For example, blue light from the northern
sky, white light at noon, and red light from a sunset all have
perfect color rendering (a CRI of 100) because our eyes are designed
to read the colors of objects illuminated by sunlight.
<P>
<B>Types of Lighting</B> 
<P>
There are four basic types of lighting: incandescent, fluorescent,
high-intensity discharge, and low-pressure sodium.
<P>
Incandescent lighting is the most common type of lighting used
in residences. Fluorescent lighting is used primarily in commercial
indoor lighting systems, while high-intensity discharge lighting
is used only for outdoor lighting applications. Low-pressure sodium
lighting is used where color rendering is not important, such
as highway and security lighting. These lighting types vary widely
in their construction, efficiency, color characteristics, and
lamp life.
<P>
<B>Incandescent</B> 
<P>
Incandescent lamps are the least expensive to buy but the most
expensive to operate. Incandescent light is produced by a tiny
coil of tungsten wire that glows when it is heated by an electrical
current.
<P>
Incandescent lamps have the shortest lives of the common lighting
types. They are also relatively inefficient compared with other
lighting types. However, significant energy and cost savings are
possible if you select the right incandescent lamp for the right
job. The three most common types of incandescent lights are standard
incandescent, tungsten halogen, and reflector lamps.
<P>
<B>Standard incandescent</B> 
<P>
Known as the &quot;A-type light bulb,&quot; these lamps are the
most common yet the most inefficient light source available.
Larger wattage bulbs have a higher efficacy than smaller wattage
bulbs. Note that a larger wattage lamp or bulb may not be the
most energy- or cost-effective option, depending on how much light
is needed. &quot;Long- life&quot; bulbs, with thicker filaments,
are a variation of these A-type bulbs. Although long-life bulbs
last longer than their regular counterparts, they are less energy
efficient.
<P>
<B>Tungsten halogen</B> 
<P>
This newer type of incandescent lighting achieves better energy
efficiency than do standard A-type bulbs. It has a gas filling
and an inner coating that reflect heat. Together, the filling
and coating recycle heat to keep the filament hot with less electricity.
These lamps are considerably more expensive than standard incandescents
and are primarily used in commercial applications: theater, store,
and outdoor lighting systems.
<P>
<B>Reflector lamps</B> 
<P>
Reflector lamps (Type R) are designed to spread light over specific
areas. They are used mainly indoors for stage/theater and store
applications, as well as floodlighting, spotlighting, and downlighting.
<P>
Parabolic aluminized reflectors (Type PAR) are used for outdoor
floodlighting. The ellipsoidal reflector (Type ER) focuses the
light beam about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in front of its enclosure
and is designed to project light down from recessed fixtures.
Ellipsoidal reflectors are twice as energy efficient as parabolic
reflectors for recessed fixtures.
<P>
<B>Fluorescent</B> 
<P>
The light produced by a fluorescent tube is caused by an electric
current conducted through mercury and inert gases. Fluorescent
lighting is used mainly indoors&Ntilde;both for ambient and task
lighting&Ntilde;and is about 3 to 4 times as efficient as incandescent
lighting. Fluorescent lamps last about 10 times longer than incandescents.
But, to gain the most efficiency, you should install fluorescents
in places where they will be on for several hours at a time.
<P>
Fluorescent lights need ballasts (i.e., devices that control the
electricity used by the unit) for starting and circuit protection.
Ballasts consume energy. You can increase the energy savings for
existing fluorescent lighting by relamping (e.g., replacing an
existing lamp with one of a lower wattage), replacing ballasts,
and replacing fixtures with more efficient models.
<P>
<B>Tube fluorescent</B> 
<P>
These lamps are the next most popular lamps after A-type incandescent
lamps. The two most common types are 40-watt, 4-foot (1.2-meter)
lamps and 75-watt, 8-foot (2.4-meter) lamps. Tubular fluorescent
fixtures and lamps are preferred for ambient lighting in large
indoor areas because their low brightness creates less direct
glare than do incandescent bulbs.
<P>
<B>Compact fluorescent</B> 
<P>
Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are the most significant lighting
advance developed for homes in recent years. They combine the
efficiency of fluorescent lighting with the convenience and popularity
of incandescent fixtures. CFLs can replace incandescents that
are roughly 3 to 4 times their wattage, saving up to 75% of the
initial lighting energy. Although CFLs cost from 10 to 20 times
more than comparable incandescent bulbs, they last 10 to 15 times
as long. This energy savings and superior longevity make
<P>
CFLs one of the best energy efficiency investments available.
<P>
When introduced in the early- to mid-1980s, CFLs were bulky, heavy,
and too big for many incandescent fixtures. However, newer models
with lighter electronic ballasts are only slightly larger than
the incandescent lamps they replace.
<P>
CFLs come in integral and modular designs. Integral CFLs have
a ballast and a lamp in a single disposable unit. Modular designs
feature a separate ballast that serves about five lamp replacements
before it wears out.
<P>
<B>High-Intensity Discharge</B> 
<P>
High-intensity discharge (HID) lamps provide the highest efficacy
and longest service life of any lighting type. They are commonly
used for outdoor lighting and in large indoor arenas.
<P>
HID lamps use an electric arc to produce intense light. They also
require ballasts, and they take a few seconds to produce light
when first turned on because the ballast needs time to establish
the electric arc.
<P>
The three most common types of HID lamps are mercury vapor, metal
halide, and high-pressure sodium. HID lamps and fixtures can save
75% to 90% of lighting energy when they replace incandescent
lamps and fixtures. Significant energy savings are also possible
by replacing old mercury vapor lamps with newer metal halide or
high-pressure sodium lamps.
<P>
Mercury vapor-the oldest type of HID lighting&Ntilde;is used primarily
for street lighting. Mercury vapor lamps provide about 50 lumens
per watt. They cast a very cool blue/green white light. Most indoor
mercury vapor lighting in arenas and gymnasiums has been replaced
by metal halide lighting, which has better color rendering and
efficiency.
<P>
Metal halide lamps are similar in construction and appearance
to mercury vapor lamps. The addition of metal halide gases to
mercury gas within the lamp results in higher light output, more
lumens per watt, and better color rendition than from mercury
gas alone. Metal halide lamps are used to light large indoor areas
such as gymnasiums and sports arenas, and for outdoor areas such
as car lots or anywhere that color rendition is important.
<P>
High-pressure sodium lighting is becoming the most common type
of outdoor lighting. It provides 90 to 150 lumens per watt&Ntilde;an
efficiency exceeded only by low-pressure sodium lighting. High-pressure
sodium lamps are also reliable and have long service lives. Their
color is a warm white, and their color rendition ranges from poor
to fairly good depending on design and intended use.
<P>
<B>Low-Pressure Sodium</B> 
<P>
Low-pressure sodium lamps work somewhat like fluorescent lamps.
They are the most efficient artificial lighting, have the longest
service life, and maintain their light output better than any
other lamp type. Low-pressure sodium lighting is used where color
is not important because it renders all colors as tones of yellow
or gray. Typical applications include highway and security lighting.
<P>
<B>Energy Efficiency with Lighting</B> 
<P>
Lighting accounts for 20% to 25% of all electricity consumed in
the United States. An average household dedicates 5% to 10% of
its energy budget to lighting, while commercial establishments
consume 20% to 30% of their total energy just for lighting.
<P>
In a typical residential or commercial lighting installation,
50% or more of the energy is wasted by obsolete equipment, inadequate
maintenance, or inefficient use.
<P>
Saving lighting energy requires either reducing electricity consumed
by the light source or reducing the length of time the light source
is on. This can be accomplished by:
<MENU>
<LI>Lowering wattage, which involves replacing lamps or entire
fixtures
<LI>Reducing the light source's on-time, which means improving
lighting controls and educating users to turn off unneeded lights
<LI>Using daylighting, which reduces energy consumption by replacing
electric lights with natural light
<LI>Performing simple maintenance, which preserves illumination
and light quality and allows lower initial illumination levels.
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
<B>Replacing Lamps and Fixtures</B> 
<P>
Relamping means substituting one lamp for another to save energy.
You can decide to make illumination higher or lower when relamping.
But be sure that the new lamp&Otilde;s lumen output fits the tasks
performed in the space and conforms to the fixture&Otilde;s specifications.
<P>
When relamping an entire store or office, first test the new lamps
in a small area to ensure adequate illumination, occupant satisfaction,
and compatibility of the new lamp and the old fixture.
<P>
Matching replacement lamps to existing fixtures and ballasts can
be tricky, especially with older fixtures. Buying new fixtures
made for new lamps produces superior energy savings, reliability,
and longevity compared with relamping.
<P>
<B>Relamping incandescent fixtures</B> 
<P>
Much has been learned about fixture design since the energy crises
of the 1970s. Many indoor fixtures trap a significant portion
of light inside the fixture, while many outdoor fixtures tend
to disperse much of their light beyond the intended area, which
causes light pollution.
<P>
New incandescent fixtures are designed to push all their light
out into the room. Others use smaller tungsten halogen lamps.
Advances in indoor fixture design include brighter reflectors
and better reflecting geometry.
<P>
Many incandescent lamps are mismatched to their tasks. Some have
excessive wattages&Ntilde;creating unnecessarily high illumination.
This can be corrected by using lamps with smaller wattage.
<P>
Some existing incandescent lamps may not be the best type of lamp
for their application. A-type light bulbs can often be replaced
with improved lamp designs, such as reflectors or tungsten halogen
lamps. And, for energy savings of 60% to 75%, many incandescent
lamps can be replaced by CFLs.
<P>
When used in recessed fixtures, standard A-type lamps and reflector
lamps waste energy&Ntilde;their light gets trapped. To save energy,
you could replace a 150-watt standard reflector with a 75-watt
ellipsoidal reflector (ER). Remember, though, that ER lamps are
less efficient at delivering light from shallow fixtures, so use
reflectors or parabolic reflectors for these purposes.
<P>
You can also replace standard A-type lamps with CFLs in spaces
where lights are needed for long periods of time. A standard
18-watt CFL replaces a 75-watt A-type lamp. CFLs are also packaged
in the same glass reflector lamps as incandescent lamps. Use CFLs
packaged as ellipsoidal reflectors (type-ER) in recessed fixtures.
Use reflector (R) or parabolic reflector (PAR) CFLs for flood
and spotlighting. New CFL fixtures have built-in electronic ballasts
and polished metal reflectors.
<P>
<B>Relamping fluorescent fixtures</B> 
<P>
Although fluorescent lamps are generally energy efficient, there
are new, even more efficient lamps that use better electrodes
and coatings than do older fluorescent lamps. They produce about
the same lumen output with substantially lower wattage.
<P>
Common 40-watt and 75-watt lamps can be replaced with energy-saving
lamps of 34 watts and 60 watts, respectively. Energy-saving lamps
for less-common fluorescent fixtures are also available.
<P>
If you need to replace the ballasts in your fluorescent fixtures,
consider using one of the improved varieties. These fluorescent
ballasts, called improved electromagnetic ballasts and electronic
ballasts, raise the efficiency of the fixture 12% to 30%.
<P>
The new electromagnetic ballasts reduce ballast losses, fixture
temperature, and system wattage. Because they operate at cooler
temperatures, they last longer than standard electromagnetic ballasts.
<P>
Electronic ballasts operate at a very high frequency that eliminates
flickering and noise. They are even more efficient than improved
electromagnetic ballasts. Some electronic ballasts even allow
you to operate the fluorescent lamp on a dimmer switch, which
usually is not recommended with most fluorescents.
<P>
<B>Improving Lighting Controls</B> 
<P>
Lighting controls are devices for turning lights on and off or
for dimming them. The simplest type is a standard snap switch.
Other controls are photocells, timers, occupancy sensors, and
dimmers.
<MENU>
<LI>Snap switches, located in numerous convenient areas, make
it easier for people in large, shared spaces to turn off lights
in unused areas.
<LI>Photocells turn lights on and off in response to natural light
levels. Photo-cells switch outdoor lights on at dusk and off at
dawn, for example. Advanced designs gradually raise and lower
fluorescent light levels with changing daylight levels.
<LI>Mechanical or electronic time clocks automatically turn on
and off indoor or outdoor lights for security, safety, and tasks
such as janitorial work.
<LI>Crank timers, which are spring-driven and similar to old oven
timers, limit lights to short durations where the need for light
is brief.
<LI>Occupancy sensors activate lights when a person is in the
area and then turn off the lights after the person has left. They
are popular for areas used infrequently, such as warehouses. They
also offer security advantages over continuous lighting: when
lights suddenly come on, they startle intruders and alert residents
and neighbors to motion in the area.
<LI>Dimmers reduce the wattage and output of incandescent and
fluorescent lamps. Dimmers also increase the service life of incandescent
lamps significantly. However, dimming incandescent lamps reduces
their lumen output more than their wattage. This makes incandescent
lamps less efficient as they are dimmed. Dimming fluorescents
requires special dimming ballasts and lamp holders, but does not
reduce their efficiency.
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
<B>Fluorescent Lamp Disposal</B> 
<P>
All fluorescent lights contain small amounts of mercury, and some
compact fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts contain small
amounts of short-lived radioactive material. Because of these
hazardous materials, you should not toss burned-out lamps into
the trash. Find out if there is a recycling program for them in
your community&Ntilde;they are becoming more common&Ntilde; or
dispose of them with other household hazardous wastes such as
batteries, solvents, and paints at your community&Otilde;s designated
drop-off point or during a designated day when you can put such
materials with your curbside trash pickup.
<P>
<B>Daylighting</B> 
<P>
Daylighting means using daylight for indoor lighting. Modern buildings
designed for daylighting typically use 40% to 60% less electricity
for lighting needs than do conventional buildings.
<P>
Sunlight and daylight are free and readily accessible. However,
using sunlight without causing glare and without overheating
a building can be difficult. Glare can be avoided by using window
sills, walls, louvers, reflective blinds, and other devices to
reflect light deep into the building. Be careful to locate windows
and skylights away from the sun&Otilde;s direct rays to avoid
overheating. For example, placing skylights on the north slope
of your roof rather than on the southern exposure may reduce heat
transfer. In addition, look for windows with new selective glazings
that transmit the most visible light while excluding the most
solar heat.
<P>
For more information on daylighting and windows, contact the Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC--see Source
List).
<P>
<B>Lighting Maintenance</B> 
<P>
Maintenance is vital to lighting efficiency. Light levels decrease
over time because of aging lamps and dirt on fixtures, lamps,
and room surfaces. Together, these factors can reduce total illumination
by 50% or more, while lights continue drawing full power. The
following basic maintenance suggestions can help prevent this.
<MENU>
<LI>Clean fixtures, lamps, and lenses every 6 to 24 months by
wiping off the dust. However, never clean an incandescent bulb
while it is turned on. The water's cooling effect will shatter
the hot bulb.
<LI>Replace lenses if they appear yellow.
<LI>Clean or repaint small rooms every year and larger rooms every
2 to 3 years. Dirt collects on surfaces, which reduces the amount
of light they reflect.
<LI>Consider group relamping. Common lamps, especially incandescent
and fluorescent lamps, lose 20% to 30% of their light output
over their service life. Many lighting experts recommend replacing
all the lamps in a lighting system at once. This saves labor,
keeps illumination high, and avoids stressing any ballasts with
dying lamps.
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
<B>Optimizing Energy Efficiency and Lighting Quality</B> 
<P>
When making changes designed to increase the energy efficiency
of lighting, it often pays to redesign the building's entire lighting
system. This can improve lighting quality, make visual tasks easier,
and save 50% or more on energy costs.
<P>
Often, you can reduce light levels without reducing light quality
by following these procedures.
<MENU>
<LI>Redesign visual tasks. For example, use a better printer with
darker printing.
<LI>Reduce light levels where there are no visual tasks. Provide
the minimum light necessary for safety, security, and aesthetics.
<LI>Reduce light levels for visual tasks where those levels are
currently excessive.
</MENU>

<P>
.
<P>
If you want to cut energy consumption from lighting while enhancing
light quality, consider the following.
<MENU>
<LI>Establish ambient illumination at minimum acceptable levels.
<LI>Provide task lighting at the optimal level depending on the
difficulty of visual tasks. For example, sewing requires more
light than cooking.
<LI>Increase the efficiency of lamps, ballasts, and fixtures.
<LI>Improve light quality by reducing glare and brightness contrast.
<LI>Use daylighting where possible and practical.
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
<B>Better Light, Less Cost</B>

Using just a few of these ideas will help lower your electricity
costs from lighting and make your home or workplace more comfortable
and efficient.
