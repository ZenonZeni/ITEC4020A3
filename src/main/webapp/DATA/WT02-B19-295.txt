<CENTER>UNFUNDED MANDATE LEGISLATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Welcome to 1995!!  As you've been warned, the Contract with America is moving at a fast pace!  The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act (with a name like that how can you be against it!) contains provisions dealing with unfunded mandates.  Unfunded mandate legislation was scheduled to be marked up in the Senate Committee on Government Affairs and the Committee on the Budget on January 9.  <P>
According to the legislation, a bill or amendment imposing a federal mandate of more than $50 million on a state or local government has to include an estimation of the cost and specify the money or taxes to pay for it.  If the bill is to be paid for with a subsequent appropriation, the bill must stipulate that the mandate will expire if it is not funded or will be scaled back if the appropriation is less than anticipated.  Legislation that is brought to the floor and does not include these provisions will be subject to a point of order.  If a point of order is brought against the bill, a majority of Members would have to vote to continue to consider the legislation.  The bill would affect prospective legislation.  It is unclear, however, whether a reauthorization or an amendment to an "old law" would make that law subject to the unfunded mandate provisions.  The Act currently does make an exception for any legislation that "enforces Constitutional rights of individuals; or establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, or handicapped or disability status."  However, we are concerned that with the Heritage Foundation and others calling IDEA an unfunded mandate, programs for children with disabilities could be at risk.  The Americans with Disabilities Act could also be in danger as an unfunded mandate.  The gains we have made for individuals with disabilities could be lost. <P>
We urge you to begin contacting your Senators and Representatives by letters, telegrams and <U>phonecalls</U> to tell them to oppose any unfunded mandate legislation that would affect special education programs under IDEA, or ADA.  There has been a great deal of office-shuffling so dial (202) 224-3121 and ask to speak to your Senator or Representative.  We have heard time and time again that Congress will be listening to <B>their constituents</B>.  Make sure they hear from you!!! <P>
Tell them:<P>
*     Special education is critical to children with disabilities.  It helps children learn and become productive, independent members of society;<BR>
<BR>
*     A penny invested now in the education of a child with a disability, saves dollars later;<BR>
<BR>
*     IDEA is not an unfunded mandate!  The obligation of states to provide education to children with disabilities was established in court cases before IDEA.  States would have to provide special education even without IDEA; and<BR>
<BR>
*     Tell them about a child with a disability who has been helped through special education!<BR>
<BR>
Please let headquarters know of any information you are able to glean from your Representative's or Senator's office.  We will continue to keep you informed as the legislation moves forward.     <P>
<CENTER><B>BUDGET UPDATE<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
</B>As the FY 1996 budget year unfolds, Congress will first be looking at FY 1995 appropriation levels.  The House is scheduled to mark up a rescission bill on January 27; the bill should be on the House floor the first week in February.  The rescission bill will cut already appropriated funds for FY 1995.  It is our understanding that the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education will have to come up with $1.5 billion in savings out of the FY 1995 appropriation levels.  At this time, we have been assured programs for children with exceptionalities will not be included in the rescission package.  Stay tuned...    <P>
<CENTER><B>THE BUDGET BOOKS ARE HERE!!!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Over the past few PAN mailings, we've been telling you about the need to be proactive in educating the new members of Congress about the importance of special education and early intervention.  As the information above indicates, it's possible that IDEA and the ADA could be at risk of being considered an "unfunded mandate" (even though they're not!).  We need to let Congress know how critical special education is to children with disabilities.  Our <I>FY 1996 Federal Outlook for Exceptional Children</I> (also fondly known as our Budget Book!!) provides you a wonderful entree to the new Representatives' and Senators' offices.  Congress needs accurate information in order to understand the importance of IDEA -- the CEC Budget Book provides that information.  We have provided you with a list of "talking points" to guide you during your visits <B>(Attachment I).</B><P>
Enclosed with this PAN mailing are enough copies of our FY 96 Budget Book for you -- our esteemed PAN Coordinators -- to hand out to all the new Congresspeople  (including freshmen and sophomores) that are now part of the 104th Congress (185 total).  Please see the attached list <B>(Attachment II)</B> for those elected officials that you should be targeting as part of our massive education effort!<P>
We have also enclosed reporting forms for you to fill out after each of your visits, and return to us in the postage-paid envelopes.  Again, nothing precludes you from visiting any Congressperson in your state, but we need to first focus on the new members.  If you want, you can send anyone in your Network, but please make sure that a reporting form is filled out for each visit made, and <B>returned to us by the end of February</B>.  If for any reason you cannot conduct a visit to any particular Congressperson, please notify us so that we can assist in making alternative arrangements for contact with that individual.  <P>
<CENTER><B>"No Recess" for the House</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The House Republicans have said they will not recess at all during the first 100 days of Congress (beginning January 4), which may make meeting with your Congressman a bit difficult -- after all, if he or she is stuck here in Washington, how can they make it back to their home districts?!!  But don't worry!  If you can't set up a meeting with your Congressman, it's just as acceptable to meet with his or her top staff people and present our issues.  This is a great opportunity for you and your Network to become familiar with these "staffers," which can be a great help in communicating our issues to their bosses.  Since our congressional representatives cannot be expected to know everything about every issue they encounter, the staffers often know more about our issues than our elected officials do!!  So, don't look upon a meeting with a staffer as a disappointment.  Look on it as a great opportunity to speak to someone who may be extremely knowledgeable and sympathetic to our cause!!!<P>
If you have any questions about the visits, the Budget Book, or anything else concerning this massive education campaign and what we need you to accomplish, please call us in DPP at (703) 264-9498.  Thanks again for all of your help!!<P>

<CENTER><B>COMMITTEE/SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS UPDATE<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
House: </B>The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities has released the subcommittee assignments for the 104th Congress.  The Subcommittee on Select Education and Civil Rights and the Subcommittee on Human Resources were eliminated, and a new subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations was established.

<CENTER><B>CEC MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON IDEA REAUTHORIZATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
And finally, if you thought you didn't have enough materials to read, we have included our recommendations on the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act!!!  The statements include general comments on such issues as funding, diagnostic definitions and categories, and mediation; as well as additional recommendations on professional preparation and standards; and early childhood.<P>
Our latest information on the reauthorization is that Congress will be concentrating first on welfare reform and vocational education, and may not get to IDEA until some time this summer.  We will keep you informed of any further developments concerning the reauthorization.<P>
If you have any questions or comments about our recommendations, please call us at (703) 264-9498.<BR>

<CENTER><B>TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR VISITS</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
1)     <B>IDEA/Gifted Funding</B> <P>
<BR>
&iuml;     Refer to the funding recommendations chart in the Budget Book; go over some of our recommendations for FY 1996.<BR>
&iuml;     The Congress originally promised that the federal government would contribute 40% of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) to help the states fulfill their obligation to education children with disabilities; however, the federal government is currently contributing only 8%.  CEC's recommendation to add $1 billion to the current Part B (State and Local Grant Program) allocation, for a total of $3,322.9 million for FY 1996, would raise the federal government's APPE to 11%.<BR>
&iuml;     Currently, the federal government gives states approximately $400 per child receiving special educations services.  However, that amount fails to come near covering special education expenses -- from $7,000-$10,000 per student.  Therefore, states are having to pick up most of the costs of educating students with exceptionalities because of the lack of federal funds.  Without IDEA, even that small amount of $400 could be threatened.<BR>
&iuml;     We need to increase the amount of funding for Part H of IDEA, the Early Intervention Program.  Congress enacted this program after evidence showed the importance of the earliest possible intervention for infants who are developmentally delayed or at risk of becoming so.  Funds invested now in the education of a child with a disability saves a lot of dollars later!<BR>
&iuml;     The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act is the only federal program designed to address the education of gifted and talented students.  The program places a priority on students who are disadvantaged, limited English proficient, and gifted children who have disabilities.  Under the current funding level, the Education Department can only fund 5% of the proposals it receives.  Therefore, CEC seeks an appropriation of $20 million for FY 1996 (an increase of $10.48 million).<BR>
<P>
2)     <B>IDEA Reauthorization</B><P>
&iuml;     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is up for reauthorization in 1995.  While Part B is permanently authorized, programs like Early Intervention and Personnel Preparation must be reauthorized this year OR they would not receive further funding.<BR>
&iuml;     Special education is critical to children with disabilities.  It helps them learn and become productive, independent members of society.  When a student with a disability receives an appropriate education, as required by IDEA, that student has a better chance of going on to postsecondary education or entering the work force, and becoming full taxpaying members of society.  Without the special education services provided under IDEA, students would not learn the skills they need to live as independent adults.<BR>
&iuml;     Talk about CEC's recommendations to the Congress to further strengthen services to children with disabilities; especially, reinforce the Parent/Professional Partnership.<BR>
<BR>
3)     <B>Unfunded Mandates</B><BR>
&iuml;     IDEA is not an unfunded mandate!  The obligation of states to provide education to children with disabilities was established in court cases before IDEA.  States would have to provide special education even without IDEA.  Therefore, the federal government is not "mandating" services to children with disabilities.  IDEA was drafted to help states meet the financial burden of meeting their Constitutional responsibilities.<BR>
<BR>
4)     <B>Personal Stories</B><P>
&iuml;     Tell the congressional member about an exceptional child in their district.  Try to bring close to home the beneficial effects that special education can have for children with exceptionalities.<BR>
