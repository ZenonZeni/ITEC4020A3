       Police Officer, <U>Police Life</U> (May
1989)
<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
The increasingly frequent reports of injuries
and deaths arising from police high speed car chases is a grave
concern for the Victorian public.
<P>
Police accident records reveal there have been
194 pursuit mode collisions involving police vehicles in Victoria
from 30 June 1990 to date, resulting in 31 civilian and 20 police
injuries and three civilian deaths.
<P>
This means that there are an average of almost
two pursuit collisions per week. 
<P>
It is not only the police and suspects who
are endangered, but any road user may be put at unjustifiable
risk.  This was illustrated by the deaths of two innocent victims
who happened to find themselves in the middle of a police &quot;hot
pursuit&quot; earlier this year.
<P>
Existing Victoria police policy relating to
high speed pursuits states that:<BR>

<P>
 &quot; All high speed driving, including police
pursuits is extremely dangerous. High speed pursuits of traffic
and minor crime offenders is rarely, if ever warranted.&quot;
(Force Circular Memo 88-5-7)
<P>
Unfortunately police practice appears to disregard
this policy guideline.
<P>
When the chase of a stolen vehicle on 10 April
last year involving nine police cars, at speeds reaching 180 kms,
resulted in a collision which put three people in hospital, the
then Assistant Commissioner (Operations), Mr Gavin Brown, was
reported as saying that police would follow exactly the same procedures
if they found themselves in the same situation in the future (The
Sun April 11 1990).
<P>
In apparent disregard for the seriousness of
the injuries, the Assistant Commissioner also rejected calls that
the pursuit posed an unjustifiable danger, saying car theft was
a serious offence.
<P>
Had the police thought logically and followed
their own advice to motorists, that &quot;speed kills&quot;, it
would be clear to them that their chase tactics would lead to
the death of motorists. 
<P>
On 24 February 1991 a Divisional police van
engaged in a pursuit collided with a taxi in Dandenong killing
the 22 year old driver and one of the passengers aged 24.  The
taxi was not directly involved in the chase (Sunday Age April
15 1990).
<P>
As a result of this incident the Police Minister
finally announced that there would be a review of police car chase
procedures.  Consequently an internal police review is being undertaken.
<P>
This internal police review has not sought
community consultation and it remains doubtful that the review
will address wider community concerns about the validity of high
speed chases (The Age 25 February 1991).
<P>
Having again recognised that this is an area
requiring attention, the police should welcome external input
and withstand constructive criticism.
<P>
The police are clearly protective of their
own authority which, it would seem, they view as more important
than public safety.
<P>
It is unfortunate that it takes a serious collision
resulting in fatality to prompt an investigation. It is even more
unfortunate when the investigation does not tackle the difficult
questions, inevitably leading to future fatalities and reviews.
<P>
In the two week period between April 24 and
May 5 1978, five civilians were killed and another five injured
in three separate police car chases in Victoria (The Age 24 April
1978, 26 April 1978, 5 May 1978). 
<P>
Four of the five killed were innocent bystanders
embroiled in the pursuit.
<P>
A review of police road rules occurred at this
time and changes were made to the procedures for emergency vehicles
under the <I>Road Safety Act</I>. 
<P>
However, it appears that little has been done
to question the validity of pursuits per se. Until this is done
the cycle will continue.
<P>
<B>POLICE PRACTICE</B>
<P>
<B>WHO PURSUES?</B>
<P>
Young male police in particular become more
readily consumed with the thrill of pursuing and testing their
driving skills.
<P>
Police describe much of the routine patrol
work as mundane.  A car chase offers the opportunity to prove
ability and to call on high speed driving skills introduced in
training.
<P>
Reflecting on his earlier year with the Force,
a New South Wales Police Officer in an article in <U>Police Life</U>
(May 1989) likened the pursuit to...
<P>
 <I>&quot; a `Clint Eastwood' showdown. Your
competence as a police officer seemed to rely solely on how quickly
you could catch the offending vehicle or how you manoeuvred around
obstacles such as red lights, traffic islands and footpaths at
high speed. </I>
<P>
<I> Even if he got away it was top fun trying
to catch him. It was a great feeling that lasted for days with
adrenalin surging, and which I welcomed with open arms every time
it happened.</I>
<P>
<I> Then when it was all over and somehow through
good luck rather than good management, you have survived, you
could return to the office feeling absolutely fantastic.&quot;</I>
<P>
The age of the officer/driver is important
not only in light of the discretion they are required to exercise
but also because the general road statistics reveal that young
male drivers are overrepresented in road deaths and injuries.
<P>
Vic Road statistics for 1990 show that almost
40% of male drivers killed or seriously injured in 1990 were males
in the 17 - 25 age group.
<P>
The federal Office of Road Safety has found
that people aged 17 - 25 account for 33% of road deaths in Australia,
although they make up only 14.5% of the population.
<P>
<B>DRIVER TRAINING</B>
<P>
Driver training for police, recruited at 18
years of age, currently consists of a two week (10 day) driving
course comprising several days lectures, some low speed driving
at the Attwood driving track and skid pan, several days driving
in the suburbs, and one day at Calder raceway doing mock pursuits
and learning evasive action skills. This practical training actually
encourages use of high speed.
<P>
At present there are three driving levels available
depending on the activities of the particular officer:       
  
<P>
 A - Motor cycle 
<P>
 B - High speed Traffic Operations Group (TOG)
pursuit vehicle
<P>
 C - At this level the officer can rely on
the emergency vehicle exemptions of the Road Safety Act and can
chase in any vehicle except the TOG cars.
<P>
It was reported in the September edition of
the Police Association Journal that police personnel are advocating
that all drivers be brought up to the B level.  This means that
all officers will be able to drive high speed TOG vehicles.
<P>
This again reflects the emphasis on encouraging
police to engage in &quot;hot pursuits&quot;, as opposed to curbing
such behaviour in the public interest.
<P>
It is interesting to note that the intake age
for ambulance drivers is 21 - 35 years.  The driver training for
ambulance officers occurs over a period of approximately seven
weeks. After this, the trainees go out in cars but are under clinical
supervision with an accompanying senior officer.
<P>
In their second year they receive further training
and become fully qualified officers at the end of their third
year.
<P>
Ambulance officers do not have to make decisions
about whether a high speed run is warranted. All attendances are
theoretically to a life threatening situation and the Ambulance
Brigade takes part in at least three times as many high speed
runs as any other emergency service.
<P>
<B>WHO IS BEING PURSUED AND WHY?</B>

<P>
As there are no official police statistics
relating to this we cannot be precise.  However, it is evident
from media reporting that the police are often chasing young males
for minor offences such as traffic and theft.
<P>
When inexperienced drivers seek to evade police,
the situation invariably becomes even more dangerous with the
high risk of them losing control of the vehicle.
<P>
The crucial questions which need to be addressed
are whether death or serious injury are appropriate penalties
for these young offenders and whether the community should be
put at further risk to apprehend them.
<P>
On 22 August 1990 police chased a 15 year old
youth in a stolen car along the Hume Highway at speeds up to 140
kph.
<P>
In attempting to avoid a police road block
the youth drove over the median strip and on the wrong side of
the highway.
<P>
A sergeant at the scene was reported as saying
that in his estimation the youth missed a head on collision by
a mere two seconds (The Sun August 23 1990). 
<P>
The youth was charged with theft and traffic
offences for which the pursuit almost resulted in death to the
offender and innocent road users.
<P>
Engaging in high speed pursuits for alleged
minor offences is simply unjustifiable given the potential danger
to the public.  Official police policy recognises this but police
practice does not. 
<P>
The Assistant Police Commissioner's comments
made in April last year stating that car theft is a serious offence
justifying dangerous pursuit is of grave concern.
<P>
Many suspected car theft or traffic offenders
who are pursued are also charged with more serious offences such
as recklessly endangering life as a result of the pursuit. Surely
the police should not be prompting the more serious charge of
risking life to apprehend for the lesser charges.
<P>
On 30 November 1991 an 18 year old car thief
slammed into the back of another vehicle injuring the driver and
his baby son.  This was after a two hour high speed pursuit through
Albury (Herald Sun 3 December 1991).
<P>
Two innocent lives were yet again almost lost.
<BR>

<P>
<B>CAN &quot;HOT PURSUITS&quot; BE JUSTIFIED?</B>
<P>
The police argue that they must be allowed
to engage in high speed pursuits to fulfil their sworn responsibility
to &quot;keep and preserve the peace and to prevent to the best
of their power all offences against same&quot; [Acting Inspec.
Neil O'Sullivan 12 April 1991]. 
<P>
Police state that if their right of pursit
is jettisoned it would be an open invitation to any car thief,
armed robber or other offender to simply speed away.
<P>
They maintain that the frequency of accidents
is few compared to the number of kilometres travelled and also
that it must be at the discretion of the individual officer in
all of the existing circumstances as to whether the chase is warranted.

<P>
Again this reflects a defensive attitude which
makes no progress toward ensuring that fatal collisions do not
occur.  These arguments have more to do with the police wanting
to defend their own autonomy than with their formal responsibilities
for the public welfare.
<P>
Available statistics indicate that there were
84 collisions during pursuit for the twelve month ending 30 June
1989 and 74 to 26 May 1990.
<P>
As before mentioned the current statistics
indicate 194 pursuit collisions from June 1990 to date with 31
civilian and 20 police injuries and 3 civilian deaths. Given the
highly dangerous nature of pursuits this is an alarming number.
<BR>

<P>
However the community concern about police
car chases relates not only to statistics, but to the issue of
whether chasing is an appropriate response in many situations,
and whether they should be allowed to continue as an accepted
means of apprehending offenders.
<P>
The Police Association argue that in most cases
the police officer will not know for what offence he/she is pursuing
until the chase is over and that hindsight can be the best and
only management tool.
<P>
Hindsight however can never justify the death
of two totally innocent road users as occurred in Dandenong this
year, particularly when there are alternative routes to arrest.
<P>
The police view does not take into account
that the pursuit in most circumstances will make an already dangerous
situation worse. A person being chased is prone to panic and invariably
will accelerate or drive more dangerously to escape.
<P>
Further it takes little account of general
public welfare and again gives unquestioned discretion to generally
young officers who may lack the experience to make a considered
decision.
<P>
Police readiness to chase in these instances
is indicative of the priority they give to property offences as
opposed to violence against the person.
<P>
Police statistics and groups working with victims
of domestic violence testify to the fact that police are reluctant
to take out Intervention Orders or to charge offenders with assault
or for breaching an order.  In fact, statistics indicate that
police fail to take any action against offenders in more than
87% of the family violence incidents they attend.
<P>
Yet it appears that police will go to extraordinary
lengths to apprehend young people for relatively minor offences
while at the same time subjecting the community to extreme danger.
<P>
What does this say about police priorities?
<BR>

<P>
<B>PUTTING PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST</B>
<P>
<B>Training</B>
<P>
The Victoria Police will undoubtedly promote
increased driver training standards.  However, the more fundamental
questions about pursuits are being ignored.
<P>
It is arguable that increased driver training
will only result in more unnecessary and dangerous pursuits. 
<P>
Any improved training of officers must include
strict directions as to the dangers of high speed pursuit and
a general premise about the absolute priority of public safety.
<BR>

<P>
This should emphasise the use of alternative
strategies to apprehend those driving stolen vehicles.
<P>
Police officers have an overriding discretion
as to whether the circumstances warrant a pursuit. For this reason
their training should be far more comprehensive and should indeed
focus on this issue. It is a decision which must be exercised
by a mature and calm mind.  The intake age for police officers
is therefore cause for serious concern. 
<P>
It is interesting to note the results of a
United States study examining young driver training and safety.
 Despite the level of training provided to a group of 18,000 students
[the students were categorised as having recieved &quot;ordinary&quot;,
&quot;advanced&quot; or &quot; super&quot; training] the study
concluded after a two year period that there was no difference
in accident rates between the groups.[Prof. McDermott, Chairman,
Road Trauma Committee, Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]
<P>
The Federation of Community Legal Centres believes
that increased or improved <I>practical</I> driver training skills
would be unlikely to result in significantly less or safer pursuits.

<P>
 <B>Accountability</B>
<P>
The police must be accountable to the community
for all aspects of their work and in particular for the results
of high speed pursuits where public safety is at risk.
<P>
The Victoria Police keep limited statistics
detailing the costs to the community of police pursuits. The statistics
that are available show only the numbers of police and civilians
killed or injured as a result of a collision.
<P>
There is no information collated to show:
<P>
 -civilians killed or injured who were passengers
in the pursued vehicle
<P>
 - persons killed or injured who were not involved
in the pursuit
<P>
 - the ages of those killed or injured
<P>
 - the age of the driver of the police vehicle
<P>
 - the alleged offences for which the police
were pursuing
<P>
 - the cost of repairing vehicles involved
in such collisions
<P>
The statistics that are available are not reliable.
 Assistant Commissioner (Traffic and Operations Support) advised
on 6 June 1990 that for the twelve month period ending 30 June
1989 there were 84 collisions during pursuit of offenders with
<I>no fatalities</I> but injuries to 16 police and 15 civilians.
<P>
Yet, on 30 March 1989 it was reported that
a man driving a stolen car died instantly in a collision during
a high speed police chase on the Calder Highway (The Age 30 March
1989).<BR>

<P>
For the public to be fully informed about police
pursuits the Federation of Community Legal Centres believes that
detailed and accurate information must be kept and publicised
annually.
<P>
<B>Overseas and Interstate Alternatives</B>
<P>
In the United States there have been significant
changes with regard to high speed pursuit.
<P>
President of the New York Police Foundation,
Patrick Murphy, recently stated that 
<P>
 &quot;police in the United States don't pursue
very much. Some departments take pride in the fact that they have
very few pursuits. They won't pursue beyond 35 miles per hour.
The reason for that is that so many motorists have been killed......More
police officers are killed in pursuits than by gunfire in the
United States.&quot;
<P>
    [Evidence to the Police Shooting Inquest,
4 Sept 1991] 
<P>
With such a high density population in the
United States, pursuits in any town or built up area are extremely
hazardous.  It is not surprising then, that pursuits are being
downgraded.
<P>
South Australian procedures relating to car
chases are quite detailed and stipulate that car chases are only
justified in the following circumstances:
<P>
 - emergencies involving obvious danger to
human life
<P>
 - detection of very serious crime
<P>
It goes on to say that traffic breaches and
illegal use are summary offences and by themselves do not constitute
serious crime. (General Duties Manual Feb 1988 para 4.2 )
<P>
The Manual also outlines comprehensive instructions
in para 4.3.2 entitled &quot;Considerations for Institution and
Continuation of Pursuit &quot; and directs officers to take into
account the seriousness of the offence, the need for immediate
apprehension, availability of other assistance, climatic conditions,
and police driver competence.
<P>
It provides that a pursuit is to be terminated
when necessity of immediate apprehension is outweighed by dangers
of continuing and when the identity of the driver/ occupants is
known, enabling apprehension to occur later.
<P>
In Tasmania police road blocks are banned and
standing orders direct that officers can pursue up to such speed
as is considered dangerous and then must pull out.
<P>
Current N.S.W. guidelines are similar to Victoria.
 However in 1985 an inquiry was referred to the Joint Standing
Committee on Road Safety of the N.S.W. parliament (the Staysafe
Committee). 
<P>
The recommendations of the committee included:
<P>
 - that the police make more use of modern
technology in cases of pursuit, for example utilising police helicopters
in cases of extended pursuits
<P>
 -that there be established a Vehicle Pursuit
Review Panel to inquire into every injury to either a police officer,
a suspected offender or an innocent bystander following a police
pursuit vehicle
<P>
 -that the reports of the panel should be made
public and also tabled in Parliament
<P>
 -that police move to upgrade the training
of police drivers in appropriate attitudes and strategic decision
making.
<P>
These recommendations unfortunately have not
been implemented.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The internal police review of policy and practice
with regard to high speed pursuits in Victoria has not sought
public comment.
<P>
Since these issues are so pertinent to public
safety, the Federation of Community Legal Centres urges the Minister
for Police and Emergency Services, Mal Sandon and the Police Commissioner,
Kel Glare, to ensure that the public is given adequate opportunity
to comment on any recommendations that may stem from the review.
<P>
It is to be hoped that the review is a progressive
one and comprehensively addresses the issues at hand.
