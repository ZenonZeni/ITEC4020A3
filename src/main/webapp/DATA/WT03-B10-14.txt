IF CONTENT IS KING, DISNEY IS PERCHED ON TOP

     It's a little early to gauge the specific impact The Walt Disney
Co.'s acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. will have on interactive
media.  Disney formed a multimedia unit eight months ago, but its
fledgling stab at the CD-ROM market so far has had mixed results. 
Although Disney recently joined forces with three Baby Bells to
produce video programming carried via telephone lines, for the most
part it has focused squarely on content and shunned direct investments
in the information superhighway.  But if content is king, you have to
like Disney's new position.
