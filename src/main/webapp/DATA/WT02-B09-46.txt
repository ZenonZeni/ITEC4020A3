<h2 ALIGN=center>Put Off Procrastination - Tackle Tasks Today</h2>

Procrastination is defined in the dictionary as "to put off until some later." Do you put things off until a later time? If so, you may have been bitten by the procrastination bug. <p>

<BR>

Most people procrastinate in at least one area of their life – at home, at work, at school, and other areas. In fact, procrastination has made an appearance in everyone's life at some point. But if your goal is to succeed, defeating the procrastination bug is necessary and important to achieving your dreams. <p>

<BR>



Consider these ways of defeating the procrastination bug:<p>



<ul>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Break projects into smaller parts. In five minutes, you could complete a task that brings you closer to your goal.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Set deadlines for yourself. Having a date to shoot for in each step will spur you onward. Hold yourself accountable to the deadlines you set. <BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Consider all your high priority "to-dos" on your planner as immovable. They all must be accomplished before you can go home or move to the next task.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Get started. Once the project is moving, procrastination problems disappear.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Find a simpler way to do the same task. You may be making it harder than it actually is. Simplify and delegate.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Use "free" time to work hard. When meetings or trips are canceled, use the time you had devoted to them to complete a lengthy project.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Use your mood swings. When you're angry, tackle high-energy tasks and when you're calm, work on the deep thinking ones.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Clear off your desk and concentrate only on one task. Design your work area productively. Keep all those items you use or need for projects nearby.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Log your current time use. It may not take as long as you remember to complete each task. Review your log and look for ways to improve productivity.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do tasks before they pile up. Complete your correspondence duties when the mail arrives, for example.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Enjoy your leisure time. This refreshes you so you work better. Avoid worry. Worrying only stresses you out.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Give yourself rewards – small ones for each step along the way and larger ones for the final completion of a project.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Add more time to your day. Get up earlier or take shorter lunches. You'll get more done and feel more satisfied.<BR>


</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Rescuing Your Lost Time</h2>

Time wasted is time lost. Most people don't intend to waste their time but end up doing just that with misguided efforts that they truly believe will save them time. Are you wasting your time? <p>

<BR>


Any affirmative answers to the following questions means you could spend your time better:<p>



<ul>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you worry about anything more than once a day? Worrying is a waste of time every time.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you take days off work just because you feel like it? Getting away from work occasionally can refresh you but abuse of this can make you fall behind. <BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you complete all your tasks yourself and seldom delegate to others? Realize that other people can do some of your tasks just as productively as you.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you bother with too many details? Some of those small matters could surprise you by solving themselves.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you daydream daily? Although daydreaming is effective some of the time, daily daydreaming is too often.<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you sometimes wonder where all your time goes? Effective time managers recognize time's value and utilize every minute of it.<BR>


<BR>
