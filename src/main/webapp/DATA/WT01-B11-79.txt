        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>An Overview </h3>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf is dedicated to one
        remarkable work: teaching hearing impaired children to
        listen and to speak. </p>
        <p>The Schools success is just as remarkable -- 97% of
        its graduates go on to mainstream high schools and 93%
        attend college. Many earn graduate and professional
        degrees. One is on the White House staff. </p>
        <p>Yet, numbers alone cannot measure the help, the hope
        and the happiness that St. Joseph's has given to
        generations of children and their parents. There is a
        singular, proud theme to St. Joseph 's 150-year history:
        doing one thing uncommonly well, with dedication and
        love. </p>
        <p>In 1837, two Sisters of St. Joseph came to frontier
        St. Louis from Lyon, France at the request of Bishop
        Joseph Rosati. They came to open a log cabin school for
        &quot;the education of mutes.&quot; It became the first
        school for deaf children west of the Mississippi. </p>
        <p>The Sisters devoted their lives to this work without
        fully realizing that St. Joseph's would achieve the
        international recognition the School enjoys today. They
        responded to a call to serve, that hearing impaired
        children might be able to hear and answer their own calls
        to happiness. </p>
        <p>In 1934, St. Joseph's took a bold step, forsaking the
        manual communication of the day to embrace the
        auditory/oral philosophy it has championed to this day.
        Today, St. Joseph's faculty is a diverse, highly trained
        and broadly experienced group of educators. But they are
        no less committed to the Institute's historic mission. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's is one of only three auditory/oral
        schools in the U.S. offering a residency option. The
        School has attracted students from over 40 states and
        many foreign countries. Dozens of families move to St.
        Louis to enroll children in the School. In addition to
        the superb education, there is the home-like setting of a
        10-acre suburban campus and the personal concern of the
        Institute's faculty and staff. </p>
        <p>A private, non-profit school, St. Joseph's is open to
        all children without regard to race, religion, sex or the
        family's ability to pay. Financial aid is available to
        all who evidence need. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's continues to break new ground in the
        advancement of deaf education. In the early 1980's it
        became a pioneer in early intervention of hearing
        impaired infants with the opening of a formative speech
        center that teaches parents how to be their child's first
        teachers of language. </p>
        <p>In 1983, the Institute came to the forefront again
        with its cochlear implant rehabilitation program, now the
        nation's largest. Over the past decade, St. Joseph's has
        responded to this biotechnical breakthrough with
        educational services designed specifically for implanted
        students. </p>
        <p>The School is actively involved in educational
        research. It was selected as the primary participant in a
        multi-year Indiana University study of speech improvement
        in cochlear implanted children. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's is a teacher of teachers. The Institute
        serves as a practicum center for up to 50 undergraduate
        teachers of the deaf, speech pathology and audiology
        students each year. Professional educators from such
        countries as Italy, Argentina, Canada, and Australia
        regularly visit the School to study its methods. </p>
        <p>Although proud of these contributions to research and
        training, St. Joseph's is, first and foremost, a school
        that teaches deaf children. It is not, however, a school
        for deafness. Its model programs exist to help hearing
        impaired children become self-determining adults who will
        have a voice in their future. </p>
