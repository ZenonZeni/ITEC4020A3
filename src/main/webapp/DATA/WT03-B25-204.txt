<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Scientists in Canberra today gained

a unique experience of seeing Japan from space.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">In a world-first demonstration, &quot;live&quot;

pictures taken by the Japanese Midori (&quot;Green&quot;) satellite were

transmitted from Hatoyama ground station near Tokyo, to Canberra's National

Convention Centre. Midori (also known as ADEOS, or Advanced Earth Observing

Satellite) was launched on 17 August from Tanegashima Space Center. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Scientists and space agency officials from

over thirty countries, meeting in Australia for the first time, have been

discussing better ways of organising the world's Earth observing effort,

to support scientific research, resource monitoring, and other applications

of satellite measurements of the world's oceans, atmosphere, ice caps and

ground surfaces. In conjunction with other groups, CEOS - the Committee

on Earth Observation Satellites - has also been considering how space-based

measurements can best complement those made from the air, sea or ground,

in order to meet the requirements of users of geographically-based information.

<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Most of the world's space agencies are

members of CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, an international

organisation for remote-sensing co-operation. CSIRO's Dr Brian Embleton

was elected Chair of CEOS at the last meeting, in Montreal last year.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">&quot;The election was international recognition

of CSIRO's commitment to deliver environmental and social benefits from

space technology,' said Dr Embleton.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">&quot;Data management networks, like the

one demonstrated today in Canberra, will enable researchers around the world

will be able to share the same observations. Users will be able to preview,

order and use data stored anywhere in the world,&quot; he said.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Space organisations in India, Japan, China

and Australia will take part in the demonstration, which was organised by

CSIRO and the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Computational Systems.

<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">CEOS is an informal association of world

space agencies, founded in 1984. CSIRO joined CEOS in 1989, and represents

Earth observation organisations from Australia. CEOS members work towards

matching future Earth observation projects with data users' needs. <BR>
