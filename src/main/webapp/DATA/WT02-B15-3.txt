Works to Revise Immigration
</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>Law<a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>As Congress struggled to reconcile the immigration bills approved by the US
House of Representatives in March, 1996, and by the Senate in May 1996,
advocates flooded House-Senate conference committee members with arguments for
and against specific provisions in one or both bills.</tt><p>
<tt>The House is not expected to formally name the members who will serve on
the conference committee until Congress returns from the July 4 recess, in part
because, once the House names its conferees, a conference bill must be produced
within a limited time.  However, deals between likely House and announced
Senate conferees are being worked out privately.</tt><p>
<tt>The major provision attacked by admissionists and political liberals was
the Gallegly amendment to the House bill, approved by a vote of 257 to 163 in
March 1996.  It would permit the states to deny unauthorized alien children
free K-12 public education, as California has sought to do with Prop 187.
Opponents of the Gallegly amendment argued that it was unfair to penalize
children for the fact that their parents illegally brought them into the US,
and pointed to the danger to US society of having uneducated children in its
midst, and to the costs of verifying each child's legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, immigration advocates tried to soften or eliminate the
provisions of the House and Senate bills that would define the receipt of
means-tested federal benefits by legal immigrants as violating the existing
prohibition of becoming a "public charge," and thus making possible the
deportation of legal migrants on that ground.</tt><p>
<tt>Campaigning in California on June 19, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential
candidate, endorsed the Gallegly amendment, saying that states should have the
choice of denying public education to illegal alien children, since they bear
the costs, which Dole put at $1.8 billion annually to California.  Rep. Elton
Gallegly (R-CA) introduced Dole and asserted that "it's time to stop making
apologies for putting Americans first."  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
says that "offering free, tax-paid goods to illegals has increased the number
of illegals."</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton has hinted that he will veto an immigration reform bill
that includes the Gallegly amendment, a veto that some Republicans believe
would hurt Clinton's chances of winning California in the presidential
election.  In this, Clinton had the support of 47 Senators, including five
Republicans, who threatened on June 10 to vote against a final immigration bill
that included the Gallegly amendment. </tt><p>
<tt>Dole supported Prop 187 in 1994, which Clinton opposed.</tt><p>
<tt>If the Gallegly amendment becomes law, and is upheld by a US Supreme Court
reversal of the 1982 Plyler v Doe decision, states will be able to order K-12
schools to check the status of all enrolling students each year.  Such checks
would keep out the estimated 600,000 to 700,000 or 1.5 percent unauthorized
children among the 45 million K-12 pupils in public schools.  Another six
million children who attend private schools would not be affected.  </tt><p>
<tt>The cost of educating illegal alien children in the US is $3 to $3.5
billion per year, based on an average cost of $5,000 per child per year.  The
Urban Institute estimated the number of illegal alien children in schools in
the seven major immigrant states in 1994: California, 307,000; Florida, 97,000;
Texas, 94,000; New York, 88,000; Illinois, 24,000; New Jersey, 16,000; and
Arizona, 15,000.</tt><p>
<tt>There was similar lobbying over the sponsorship and benefit changes
included in the bill that affect legal immigrants.  Under US immigration law,
an immigrant is deportable if he/she becomes a "public charge" in the US.  In
order to secure an immigration visa for a relative, US-resident sponsors
commonly sign an affidavit promising to support the immigrant once he/she is
here.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under current practice, the US sponsor and the immigrant must have a
combined income that is at least 100 percent of the income at the US poverty
line for the US sponsor AND the immigrant(s) being sponsored.  At the present
time, that would be, for example, $18,220 for a US family of three sponsoring
an immigrant couple--five people in all.</tt><p>
<tt>Many immigrants who are sponsored by US residents nonetheless apply for
federally-funded benefits after they arrive.  US courts have held that the
sponsors' affidavits are not binding, so that the government cannot sue a US
sponsor for the welfare benefits that were paid to an immigrant whom the
sponsor promised to support.  </tt><p>
<tt>The pending immigration bills would raise the income required of US
residents to sponsor an immigrant to 200 percent of the poverty line (House) or
125 percent of the poverty line (Senate), make the affidavits binding on the US
sponsor, and deem or assume that the immigrant has access to the sponsor's
income for the purpose of determining whether the immigrant is eligible for
benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>Advocates for immigration attacked the income requirement for sponsors,
arguing that it would permit only "rich Americans" to sponsor
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Another provision in the proposed law would permit the deportation of
immigrants who received federal benefits for 12 months within the first five
years in the US (Senate) or first seven years (House), the immigrant could be
deported.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most groups favorable to immigration opposed this extension of the grounds
for deportation, calling attention to the wide range of benefit claims that
could lead to deportation, including e.g., federal student loans and job
training programs, and outlining the health threat to US residents from
immigrants who avoided obtaining subsidized medical care.  Using cases of
immigrants who received training or education and now are successful, advocates
asked whether the US would really deport successful immigrants.  For example,
an estimated 500,000 legal immigrant college students receive $700 million in
federal assistance each year, and many are employed by major US corporations.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed restrictions on
immigrant access to benefits could save federal taxpayers up to $7 billion over
seven years.  Many members of Congress said that they supported the
restrictions on immigrant access to federal benefits to balance the budget, not
to discourage immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>In attacking the denial of federally subsidized health benefits, advocates
stressed that services such as public health cut public expenditures in the
long run by minimizing the spread of communicable diseases, avoiding emergency
room care for treatable diseases, and improving the health of US-citizen
babies.  </tt><p>
<tt>One issue that arises in these proposed new restrictions on access to
schools, benefits, and health is their administrative costs.  Opponents of the
restrictions argue that the cost of checking the legal status of pupils
enrolling in school or seeking benefits would be formidable.</tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of restrictions, on the other hand, argue that administrative
costs would be a marginal addition to current screening procedures.  Schools
already verify age, residence, and immunization, for example, and the income of
beneficiaries of means-tested programs is checked, since they will not be
reimbursed if they provide benefits to persons with incomes above qualifying
levels.</tt><p>
<tt>This suggests two major considerations in evaluating the arguments.  First,
how much money would the restrictions save in the short and long runs?  Second,
would the benefit restrictions have as a side effect the discouragement of
legal immigrants likely to need tax-supported benefits?  </tt><p>
<tt>The Gallegly amendment is perhaps the clearest example of a possible new
trend in industrial democracies--use integration policy to affect immigration
flows. The theory is that fewer benefits will discourage illegal immigrants
from coming, or staying.</tt><p>
<tt>Research suggests that illegal aliens generally come to the US for jobs,
not welfare or other benefits, so the restrictions on benefits for legal
immigrants may wind up pushing what is now in part a federal responsibility
onto states, cities, and families without affecting the influx of illegal
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration may remain in the political spotlight during the summer of 1996
if Dole seriously tries to win California's 54 electoral votes, one-fifth of
the number needed to be elected President.  The Reform Party of Ross Perot may
also keep immigration in the spotlight if it nominates as its presidential
candidate Richard Lamm, the former governor of Colorado and an outspoken
opponent of high levels of immigration. </tt><p>

<tt><u>Border Control.</u>  On May 28, 1996, the INS announced that it was
adding 185 agents to patrol the eastern parts of San Diego county to curb
illegal alien entries from Mexico.  In addition, 11 FBI agents have been
assigned to deal with alien smuggling rings.</tt><p>
<tt>Border apprehension data, released monthly, are now reported in the press.
In May 1996, apprehensions were three percent below levels of twelve months
earlier, the first decrease since the December 1994 peso devaluation.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the San Diego sector, 40,761 illegal aliens were apprehended in May
1996, versus 67,282 in May 1995; 6,078 in El Centro versus 4,271; 3,189 in Yuma
versus 2,408; 28,604 in Tuscon versus 20,613; 13,435 in El Paso versus 10,722;
1,105 in Marfa versus 965; 11,338 in Del Rio versus 7,007; 11,828 in Laredo
versus 9629; and 19,899 in McAllen versus 17,277.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton requested $3.1 billion for the INS in FY97.  The INS now
has 5,200 Border Patrol agents, and 600 more are in training.</tt><p>
<tt>One unanticipated effect of Operation Gatekeeper is that aliens attempting
entry in eastern San Diego county have started fires in remote areas that are
difficult for firefighters to reach.  On June 5, 1996, supervisors declared an
emergency in eastern San Diego county after 212 fires broke out between January
and May 1996, up from 64 in the same period in 1995.  San Diego county asked
the federal government for funds and permission to build roads through
environmentally sensitive areas to control the fires.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-June, five illegal aliens believed to be on the search for work in
California were found dead in the Arizona desert, reminding observers that in
July 1980, 13 Salvadorans died trying to cross the Organ Pipe National Monument
south of Ajo, Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and Congress continue to debate how to best utilize additional
personnel and money to reduce illegal immigration.  Congress would like to see
a concentrated effort to halt immigration at the border.  The INS contend that
they should make decisions regarding enforcement, and not be dictated to across
the country by members of Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and Congress are arguing over the fate of the San Clemente,
California inland border checkpoint.  On weekends, northbound traffic headed
for Los Angeles can back up for hours on Interstate 5 as 100 Border Patrol
agents inspect cars for illegal aliens-- illegal alien smuggling is
concentrated on the weekends.  The INS plans a $13-million project to add two
lanes, an administrative office, and all-weather canopies for the Border Patrol
agents.</tt><p>
<tt>Legislation to fund the project required that construction begin by July 1
or the checkpoint would be closed down.  Construction is not scheduled until
the winter of 1996.  The checkpoint faces a shutdown during construction or if
the Border Patrol finds it cannot keep the lanes operating 24 hours a day,
which is required by law.  The Border Patrol hopes to use a clause in the
legislation which says that if the July 1 deadline is not met, it can be
circumvented if the attorney general certifies that "exigent circumstances"
exist. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS and Congress also continue to haggle over the construction of a
fence through a 14-mile stretch of border between the Pacific Ocean and Otay
Mountain.</tt><p>
<tt>A May 30 National Public Radio story on illegal immigrants from Cotija,
Michoacan, a town of 20,000 in summer, and 30,000 in Janaury, when migrants are
home, reported that daily wages were $50 to $100 in the US, versus $5 in
Cotija.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 10, 1996, on his 24th visit to California since he took office in
January 1993, President Clinton promised to do more to prevent illegal
immigration and drug smuggling across the Mexico-US border.  According to
Clinton, since January 1995, 1,700 illegal aliens have been jailed in the
United States after having slipped back into the country following their
expulsions.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS still has in custody some of the 286 Chinese aliens who were on the
Golden Venture, the ship that went aground in New York harbor on June 6, 1993.
An estimated 100,000 Chinese, some paying $25,000 to $35,000 each, are believed
to be smuggled into the US each year. </tt><p>
<tt>A Justice Department investigation found that senior officials of the INS
transferred or released more than 100 illegal immigrants from detention in
Miami in 1995 in order to hide overcrowding and understaffing from the
Congressional Task Force on Immigration Reform.  As a consequence, four senior
INS officials were relieved of their supervisory duties. </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the detainees who were released by INS were Cubans or Haitians had
not received medical clearance or faced criminal charges. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Employer Sanctions</u>.  The INS in October 1995 launched raids on some
of the estimated 2,500 of the 6,000 sewing shops in New York City believed to
be operating in violation of labor and immigration laws.  There are believed to
be some 22,000 garment contractors in the entire US.  </tt><p>
<tt>By June 2, 1996, 86 shops had been inspected in New York City.  Forty-five
INS inspectors, almost triple the usual 17 inspectors, apprehended 1,228
unauthorized workers.  About 80 percent of the unauthorized workers apprehended
were Mexicans or Salvadorans.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS hopes that, by targeting industries known to employ unauthorized
workers, it can make employers less likely to hire them, and that illegal
aliens will thus be discouraged from coming to the US.  INS therefore looks to
the number of job slots freed up for workers legally resident in the US, and
the wages that they can earn in these jobs, as measures of its success.  The
INS operates a pilot program in the New York garment industry that permits
employers to check on the legal status of non-US citizens hired to work.</tt><p>
<tt>In an account of June 3 critical of INS enforcement procedures, the New
York Times reported that most of the illegal workers were released back on the
streets the very day they were apprehended.  During the first ten months of the
factory inspection program, according to the report, only about 25 percent were
detained for more than a few hours.  Apprehended workers are often freed
pending a hearing to determine whether they should be ordered to leave the US,
a proceeding usually two to five months after their apprehension.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS apprehended 12,000 illegal alien workers in US workplaces in
FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>Kathie Lee Gifford, a TV talk show host, found that fashions bearing her
name were sewn in a New York City sweatshop.  She held a joint press conference
in June 1996 with Labor Secretary Robert Reich to announce a July 1996
conference in Washington DC to bring together retailers, manufacturers and
celebrities to discuss how to fight sweatshops.  Gifford earned $9 million in
1995 from her line of clothing.</tt><p>
<tt>Two interesting aspects of the subject emerged.  First, the garment
industry is one of the few US industries in which someone can become a sizable
US employer--with 25 or more employees--for an investment of less than $50,000.
Poorly-capitalized sewing shops are vulnerable to market changes, as well as
stepped up enforcement--many do not pay overtime wages on rush jobs from
manufacturers for hot-selling garments.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, there is a radical difference between New York state labor
inspectors and INS workplace inspectors.  The INS inspectors are concerned only
about the workers' legal status, but not their wages or working conditions,
while the state inspectors care about wages but not legal status.  Indeed, in
New York, California and other states with high levels of immigration, there is
an explicit policy by state labor inspectors, who are often the most familiar
with local employers, of NOT cooperating with the INS (the 800 federal labor
inspectors are, on the other hand, obliged to report suspected immigration
violations to the 300 INS inspectors nationwide).</tt><p>
<tt>In many European countries, by contrast, the agency with the most labor
market expertise, the labor agency, has responsibility for detecting and
removing unauthorized workers from the work place.  European labor agencies
often see removing illegal workers as a means of protecting legal
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The US-based National Labor Committee charged that half of the 29 sewing
firms that make garments in Haiti for US firms such as Disney, JC Penny, and
other US retailers pay less than Haiti's $2.40 per day minimum wage--workers
are desperate for jobs, as unemployment is 75 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Labor Committee also accused Nike of paying Indonesian workers
who make its athletic shoes $0.14 per hour;  Nike countered that its Indonesian
workers earn an average $0.50 per hour, double the national minimum wage, and
receive free meals and health care.  The group, Made in the USA, charged that
basketball player Michael Jordan earns $ 20 million a year endorsing Nike
sneakers, and claimed that this is more than the total annual payroll for the
Indonesians who help make them. </tt><p>
<tt>Nike subcontractors around the world must sign a Memorandum of
Understanding that "strictly prohibits child labor, and certifies compliance
with applicable government regulations regarding minimum wage, (and)
overtime."</tt><p>
<tt><u>Smuggling.</u>  The INS on May 29 announced that it had arrested a woman
operating in Reynosa, Mexico, who was making over $1 million annually smuggling
South Asians and Chinese into the US via Central America and Mexico.  In
December 1995, the INS estimated that up to 100,000 South Asians and Chinese
may be smuggled into the US in this way each year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican legislature is considering increasing penalties for alien
smuggling, and doubling the maximum prison term for alien smuggling to 20
years.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum.</u> On June 13, 1996, the US Board of Immigration Appeals in an
11-1 decision granted asylum to a Togo woman who asked for asylum in the US
because, she asserted, she faced female genital mutilation in Togo.  A US
immigration judge rejected her application for asylum in August 1995, but the
ruling is binding on the nation's 179 immigration judges.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS had asked the BIA to return the case to the immigration judge for
rehearing after BIA adopted the INS position that asylum could be granted to
women who fear forced mutilation without consent, and have no opportunity to
move to avoid the practice, as to a city in their  country.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 85 million women, mostly in Africa, are believed to have been
subjected to female genital mutilation.  Begun in the 5th century BC, the
custom is observed by Muslims, Christians and adherents of traditional
religions in Africa and Asia.  The Senate immigration reform bill would make
mutilation of female genitalia a federal crime punishable by up to five years
in prison, but would not make the threat of such mutilation the basis for an
asylum claim.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS reported in May 1996 that it processes 80 percent of the asylum
applications it receives within 60 days after they are filed.</tt><p>

Voting Rights and Emigration</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Voting Rights</u>.  In mid-June, Mexico's major political parties, the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the left-leaning Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD), and the conservative National Action Party (PAN),
agreed to permit Mexican citizens living outside the country to vote in the
next Presidential election, scheduled for 2000.  There are at least 7 million
Mexican nationals living in the US, and Mexicans abroad are expected to cast 1
to 5 million votes--there were 35 million votes cast in the 1994 Mexican
Presidential election.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not yet clear how Mexicans in the US would vote.  US citizens abroad
mail ballots to the US--some 2 million ballots were mailed to the US in 1992.
However, Mexico's opposition parties oppose mail ballots, fearing fraud.</tt><p>
<tt>How would US citizens react to Mexican candidates campaigning for votes in
California and other places where Mexican nationals live?  Some fear that
Mexican flags would increase anti-Mexican sentiment in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Emigration</u>.  An analysis of Mexican data suggests that 55 percent of
the Mexico-to-US migration between 1985 and 1990 was from an urban area of
Mexico to an urban destination in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Institute for Statistics, Geography and Information (INEGI)
estimated that Mexico had 91.1 million residents in 1995, up 10 million since
1990.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Greater Mexico City, which includes 27 suburbs, was home to 16.4 million
people - considerably fewer than previous estimates of 23 million
residents.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>.  Mexico's economy shrank one percent in the first
quarter of 1996, less than the three percent projected.  However, many small
businesses are struggling because of debts that they assumed in the boom year
of 1994, and their debts have increased in 1995 and 1996.  Interest rates are
30 percent for mortgages, and 50 percent for credit card debt.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has 8 to 10 million workers in unions, but the most powerful union
leader is Don Fidel Valazquez, leader of the three million strong CTM.</tt><p>
<tt>The NAFTA-created Commission on Labor Cooperation in Dallas released its
annual report on labor markets in Canada, Mexico, and the US in May 1996, and
reported that real wages fell since 1984 in all three countries.  In Mexico,
for example, real wages fell sharply between 1984 and 1988, then began to
increase in the late 1980s, and were above 1984 levels in 1994.  However, in
1995, real Mexican wages fell again, to five percent below their 1984
levels.</tt><p>
<tt>US real earnings were down eight percent between 1984 and 1995, and
Canadian real earnings were unchanged.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has the smallest proportion of full-time employees among NAFTA
countries--57 percent, versus 84 percent in Canada and 91 percent in the US.
In the US, 57 percent of the women in the labor force worked full time, versus
49 percent of the women in Mexico, and 37 percent of the women in
Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>Virtually all of the job growth between 1984 and 1995 in the US and Canada
was in services, versus 81 percent of the job growth in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Forbes Magazine published an upbeat story on "Maquiladora-ville," or
Tijuana, on May 6, 1996, which asserted that Tijuana's population of 1.5
million is growing by seven percent or 105,000 per year as Mexicans flock to
Tijuana for maquiladora jobs.  Forbes reported that many maquiladora workers
live in shanty towns without running water, and that absenteeism and turnover
are problems for factory managers.</tt><p>
<tt>As of April 1996, 701,141 Mexicans were employed in maquiladoras, up 13
percent over April 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Grupo Beta.</u>  Mexico has special police units known as Grupo Alpha,
Beta etc whose purpose is to prevent crimes being committed against aliens
seeking to leave Mexico for the US.  In June, 1996, Mexico announced the
formation of a 20 to 30 person<u> </u>Grupo Beta Sur, an independent police
force in the southern state of Chiapas.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has criticized the US for videotaped beatings of illegal Mexican
immigrants, but President Zedillo reportedly asserted that he fears "that one
day they will make a video . . . of what happens when some of our Central
American brothers are intercepted by Mexican authorities."  Many of the
smugglers who charge $1,000 each to smuggle Central Americans through Mexico
and into the US are linked to criminal gangs.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has been returning to Guatemala about 350 Central  Americans daily.
Mexico's National Migration Institute reported that 105,063 foreigners were
deported from Mexico in 1995, including 575 from India and 184 from
China.</tt><p>
<tt>The fifth year of drought in Mexico may be increasing emigration pressure
in Chihuahua, Sonora, Coahuila, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo Leon.  Many
farmers have sold cattle rather than feed them--contributing to lower US beef
prices--and fewer acres of corn were planted because of the lack of water,
increasing Mexican corn imports.</tt><p>
<tt>There were widespread rumors in June of a possible coup against President
Zedillo sometime after December 1, 1996.  Under Mexican law, after a president
has served at least two years of a six-year term, he can be replaced by a
person from the ruling party.  Reportedly, powerful PRI functionaries fear that
continuing social chaos and a still stagnant economy will cause the PRI to lose
badly in 1997 mid-term elections and would like to find a more attractive
candidate to lead their party.</tt><p>

Internal Migration and Strikes</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Internal Migration</u>.  California in July 1995 had an estimated 32
million residents, reflecting 569,000 births in 1994-95, 222,000 deaths,
260,000 net foreign immigrants, and a net 334,000 California residents who
moved to other states.  According to a new analysis by the California
Department of Finance, the net number of residents moving to other states
exceeded the net number of immigrants to California in 1992-93, 1993-94, and
1994-95.</tt><p>
<tt>California lost a net 143,000 residents to other states in 1995, reflecting
the slowdown in the state's population growth in the first half of the
1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>During the 1980s, California gained a net 1.25 million residents from the
other 49 states.  Between 1990 and 1995, California lost a net 1.55 million
residents to other states.  California gained a net 1.4 million immigrants in
the first half of the 1990s, or almost 300,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>California, which had an estimated population of 31.6 million in 1995, is
expected to have 41 million residents in 2010.  California's population growth
is fueled by births (over 600,000 per year) and immigration (over 300,000 per
year).</tt><p>
<tt>In reviewing population growth since 1980, demographer Hans Johnson notes
that California's population increased by 500,000 in 1980, a peak 900,000 in
1989, and then 100,000 in 1993.  Johnson's estimates, based, inter alia, on the
assumption that 91 percent of the 18 to 64 year-old residents have drivers'
licenses, and treating net illegal immigration as a residual after all other
factors affecting the number of California residents have been taken into
account, suggest that there was very high unauthorized immigration to
California in the late 1980s, as well as a high outmigration of US-born
residents to other states.  </tt><p>
<tt>Estimates of illegal immigration based on apprehension data, by contrast,
report declining illegal immigration in the late 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>In the March 1995 CPS, there were 23 million foreign-born persons in the
US, including 6.7 million who were born in Mexico, 1.2 million born in the
Philippines, 0.8 million born each in Cuba and China, and more than 0.6 million
each born in Canada, El Salvador, and Germany.  Two-thirds of the Mexican
immigrants reported that they arrived since 1980--2.6 million in the 1980s, and
1.7 million or 345,000 per year in the 1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>The employment-to-population ratio of recent immigrants is declining.  In
1960, 93 percent of the 18-64 foreign-born males who arrived in the previous
five years and were not in school were employed or looking for work, 88 percent
in 1970, 81 percent in 1980, and 80 percent in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Strikes.</u>  In Los Angeles, a month-old boycott by many of
the 6,500 largely immigrant truck drivers at the port in Long Beach fizzled
out, as most truckers returned to work.  The drivers are considered
"independent contractors" by the firms that hire them to deliver freight.  The
truckers agreed to stop delivering freight when they were promised $25 per hour
if they forced shipping firms to use a single trucking company.</tt><p>
<tt>It appears that, in the future, pressure on the truck drivers will grow as
more shipping companies transfer containers directly from ships to rail cars
for distribution throughout the US.  Los Angeles handles about 25 percent of US
ocean-going freight.</tt><p>
<tt>Also in Los Angeles, nine Chinese immigrants who had been smuggled into the
US, and were being held hostage until their relatives in Fujian came up with
more money to pay the smugglers, escaped after shooting one of the smugglers.
The nine had paid $3,000 of the $15,000 fee in China, and the smugglers
demanded an additional $20,000 once the Chinese were in Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt>Mounted Los Angeles police were used in a first-ever effort in mid-June to
patrol a popular gathering spot for day laborers in the western San Fernando
Valley, on Fallbrook Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills.
Gathering on a street corner to look for work is not illegal in Los
Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Criminal Aliens.</u>  The California State Senate rejected a nonbinding
resolution urging Congress to station an immigration officer are each jail in
California to make sure illegal immigrants who are arrested are
deported.</tt><p>
<tt>The Anaheim Police Officers Association asked their city council to pass a
resolution that called for federal legislation to make it a felony offense to
be in the US without the proper documentation and to allow local, county and
state law enforcement agencies to arrest suspected illegal immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Benefits and Costs.</u>  A new study by the Tomas Rivera Center found
that, over the course of their lifetimes, immigrants contribute more in taxes
to California than they cost in government services.</tt><p>
<tt>The report found that the average immigrant costs the state of California
about $62,600 in educational expenditures.  However, when lifetime tax payments
are adjusted to reflect what is repaid solely in education taxes, the immigrant
will return about $89,437.  According to the study, taxes for education plus
those for social programs are $24,493 for legal immigrants, and $7,890 for
illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>About nine percent of the foreign-born mothers aged 14 to 44 were on AFDC,
compared to 11 percent of the native-born mothers in the same age group.</tt><p>
<tt>Polls suggest that, from 1965 to 1993, the proportion of Americans favoring
increased immigration has been stable at about seven percent.  The number of
respondents favoring less immigration, however, rose from 33 percent in 1965 to
61 percent in 1993.  A December 1995 Roper poll reported that 70 percent of the
respondents favor fewer than 300,000 immigrants a year.</tt><p>
<tt>Sixteen percent of a 500-person sample of Latinos in Los Angeles metro area
reported experiencing racism or discrimination in the US.  The sample was
composed of 55 percent legal immigrant, 29 percent US citizens and 16 percent
unauthorized immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 10,000 immigrants took their oaths of citizenship on June 19 in the
first of several mass ceremonies planned in Los Angeles.  In June, 1996, 38,000
new citizens are expected take the oath in Southern California.  The
seven-county southern California region is expected to account for nearly
one-third of a record one million new citizens nationwide.  </tt><p>
<tt>The rise in the number of immigrants seeking citizenship is attributed to
several factors including increased the anti-immigrant initiatives and proposed
legislation to reduce benefits for legal and illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Economic Growth.</u>  California's economy appears to be rebounding.
The unemployment rate dropped to 7.5 percent in April 1996, and about 561,000
net new jobs have been added in California since January 1993--at current
rates, California is adding about 300,000 net new jobs per year, or almost
1,000 per day.</tt><p>
<tt>California received an average $4853 in federal spending for each of its
31.4 million residents in 1995, less than the $5161 US average.  Half of the
$152.5 billion in federal payments were Social Security checks.</tt><p>

Update in New York, Florida and

<tt>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on June 6 criticized Bob Dole for
supporting immigration legislation that would restrict federal aid to
immigrants.  According to Giuliani, Republicans should not follow public
opinion polls that show broad support for measures to curb illegal immigrants,
and to reduce assistance for immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Giuliani also criticized a provision of the pending immigration bill that
would require state and local agencies to notify the INS if they detect illegal
aliens.  New York has since 1984 prohibited city agencies from cooperating with
the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>Huntington Station in Long Island, New York has been battling
concentrations of day laborers at city corners--one street corner has between
125 to 150 men each day looking for jobs.  Local business owners say the
immigrant workers are dangerous, because they stand on a traffic island during
the rush hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Business leaders tried to move the day laborers to a park down the street,
but local residents said they didn't want unemployed men hanging around the
children's park and near the school bus stop.  </tt><p>
<tt>A compromise was made to move the day laborers to a parking a lot a block
away from the park, but no one told the immigrant workers, who remain on the
traffic island. </tt><p>
<tt>Attorney General Janet Reno and Florida Governor Lawton Chiles announced in
May the expansion of programs to halt illegal immigration into Florida,
including an airport court at Miami International Airport to deal with
foreigners who arrive in the US without proper documents.  The INS will also
establish a detention center at the airport.  Chiles announced that he will
soon sign an executive order forbidding the state to contract with any employer
known to hire illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 17, Chiles traveled to Haiti to discuss illegal immigration with
Haitian President Rene Preval.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration lawyers are increasingly filing petitions for dependency for
minor children who are abandoned in the US by parents who send them to the US
to live with relatives.  The ward of the state procedure was developed to help
social workers get US children out of abusive homes, but the INS grants
immigrant status to minors whom US courts declare to be wards.</tt><p>
<tt>The Farmworkers Coordinating Council in Boynton Beach says that "hundreds"
of 10 to 17 year-old minors who left their families in Mexico or Central
America are working in South Florida agricultural fields.</tt><p>
<tt>The Latino Institute and the Urban Institute issued a report on May 16
estimating that the 244,000 unauthorized immigrants in Illinois pay about $547
million annually in taxes, and receive $238 million in services--virtually all
of the expenditures were for providing K-12 education to an estimated 33,000
unauthorized children at an average annual cost of $7,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be about 138,000 unauthorized Mexicans in Chicago,
followed by 47,000 Poles. </tt><p>
<tt>The seven taxes included in the study are federal and state income, state
and local sales, property, Social Security and Unemployment Insurance. The
social-service programs include Supplemental Security Income; Aid to Families
with Dependent Children; Aid to Aged, Blind and Disabled; Transitional
Assistance; Medicaid; and K-12 public education.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 29, 1996, a Save Our State-Arizona initiative was filed with the
Arizona Secretary of  State's Office.  If organizers obtain the 112,961 valid
signatures to place the measure on the November election ballot, Arizona voters
will decide whether to make employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants
legally liable for damages.  The initiative would also create a state
"verification center" to determine whether job applicants have legal
documents.</tt><p>

<tt>More than 435,000 Cubans--about four percent of that nation's population--
applied in the US visa lottery that closed April 30, 1996 for about 6,000 slots
to enter the US.  The lottery is part of a 1994 agreement between the United
States and Cuba to allow at least 20,000 Cubans a year to immigrate to the
United States. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, over 190,000 Cubans applied for US immigration visas, and 5,398
were granted visas.</tt><p>
<tt>Since early 1996, more than 60 Cubans arrived in Jamaica seeking political
asylum.  The Jamaican government is considering the approval of a draft
agreement to repatriate the illegal Cuban immigrants.  The document was signed
by Cuban officials on May 15. </tt><p>
<tt>The 60 illegal Cuban immigrants join another 60 who arrived on the island
between 1994 and 1995.  Some of the original asylum seekers were given work
permits and visas.  Some have fled Jamaica for Puerto Rico rather than risk
repatriation to Cuba. </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 Haitians in the Dominican
Republic at any one time, working mainly on sugar and rice plantations.  On
April 30, some Haitians living illegally in the Dominican Republic were
repatriated.  Immigration is one of the many points of tension between the
Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and Creole/French-speaking Haiti.</tt><p>
<tt>In Haiti, the government is worried about "hundreds" convicted criminals
begin returned from the US, Canada, and France, where many resume their lives
of crime with drive-by shootings, carjackings, and kidnappings.  The risk of
arrest for crime is low in Haiti, given a newly formed, inexperienced police
force, and an overwhelmed justice system.</tt><p>
<tt>The proportion of foreign workers in Bermuda has risen to 22 percent of the
workforce; there were 7,521 foreigners and  26,612 Bermudans employed in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1995, Costa Rica began to tighten checks on Nicaraguans who
enter the country.  Costa Rica estimates that 475,000 Nicaraguans live in Costa
Rica, more than half of them illegally.  Tensions flared in March 1995, when
Nicaragua detained 13 Costa Rican border guards that it maintained chased a
Nicaraguan into the country. </tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, Costa Rica announced plans to grant six-month temporary work
permits to some of the 175,000 Nicaraguans who come into the country every year
as seasonal farm workers for the sugar cane and coffee harvests --the Costa
Rican government gives the permits to employers, who in turn give them to
foreign workers.</tt><p>

<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  The number of asylum seekers in the 15 EU member states,
plus Norway and Switzerland, decreased by 11 percent to 290,000 in 1995, down
from 325,000 in 1994, according to a report by Eurostat.  Germany received 47
percent of the asylum applications in 1995, up from 41 percent in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Western  Europe, Australia, Canada and the US received a total of 468,000
asylum applications in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum applicants from ex-Yugoslavia and Romania fell in
1995, but there was an increase in applicants from Turkey, Iraq, and
Pakistan.</tt><p>
<tt><u>EU Immigration Controls</u>.  The Guardian newspaper reported in June
that interior and justice ministers in November 1993 planned for a "Fortress
Europe" policy on immigration.  According to the Guardian, the plan to
fingerprint all asylum seekers in the EU was launched in the summer of 1993,
and approved by the EU Council of Ministers in November 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Eastern European nations have displaced developing African and Asian
nations as the major source of foreign prostitutes in Western Europe, according
to the European Commissioner for Justice, Anita Gradin at a June 17 press
conference.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 200,000 to 500,000 women are involved.  Many are young; 75 percent
were under 25 in one study, including many aged 15 to 18.  Most traveled to
Western Europe on tourist visas.  In Germany, foreign prostitutes make up about
75 percent of the total, in Italy, 80 percent, and in Austria, 85
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Many countries want penalties for smuggling aliens increased.  Drug
smuggling typically results in prison terms of 10 to 12 years, versus one to
two years for smuggling aliens.  Studies released by the European Commission
have found that there is growing collusion between drugs and arms traffickers
and those involved in smuggling women.  EU states were urged to offer special
protections to women willing to testify against traffickers.   </tt><p>
<tt>Women are still being recruited in the developing countries such as Ghana,

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Germans
Consider Immigration Policy</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration Policy</u>  On June 18, German President Roman Herzog called
for immigration in order to increase the size of the working population and
thus save Germany's pension system.  In a speech to the German Federation of
Industry (BDI) in Bonn, Herzog said that "an active immigration policy," plus
raising the retirement age and increasing the number of women working, were
essential to preserving Germany's social welfare state.</tt><p>
<tt>The Free Democrats (FDP) on June 10, 1996 called for permitted annual level
based in part on conditions in the German labor and housing market.  Such a
system would open new doors to immigrants wishing to move to Germany.  Under
current immigration law, foreigners can settle in Germany if they are joining
their families or if they are successful asylum seekers (ethnic Germans from
the ex-USSR can also settle in Germany as German citizens).</tt><p>
<tt>The FDP also called for easier naturalization for foreign children born in
Germany.  Party leader and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel asserted that "It must
be easier for foreigners whose lives center on Germany in the long term to have
access to German citizenship," suggesting that third-generation foreigners born
in Germany should become Germans by birth.</tt><p>
<tt>Kinkel also said that "Germany needs an overall concept for  immigration
and integration."</tt><p>
<tt>Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) oppose set levels of
immigration, and the secretary general of the CDU sister party, the CSU,
Bernard Protzner, said that "Germany is not a land of  immigration, and we will
not make it into one.  There will be no such law (annual immigration levels) as
long as the CSU can help it."</tt><p>
<tt>There are about seven million foreigners living in Germany with 81 million
German residents, about one-fourth of the foreigners were born in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed in 1990 to accept for humanitarian reasons an
unlimited number of Jews from what was the Soviet Union.  More than 45,000 Jews
and their relatives have come to Germany, and another 41,000 have been approved
for entry when they wish.  In May, there was talk that the government would
soon limit Jewish immigration from the ex-USSR, in part because of a rash of
forged documents in which people claimed to be Jews, but the rumors were denied
by the government.</tt><p>
<tt>Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said that, because there was
no quota on the number of Jews who could move to Germany from the ex-USSR,
Germany might come into "conflict with Israel which regards itself as the
homeland for the Jews."</tt><p>
<tt>Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) leader Joerg Haider on June 14, 1996 called
for unemployed foreigners to be deported.  There are an estimated 36,000
unemployed foreigners in Austria.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese.</u>  On June 18, 1996, Vietnam announced that it was ready
to accept more than 2,000 Vietnamese living in Germany, taking the first step
toward fulfilling a July 21, 1995 agreement to take back by the year 2000 up to
40,000 of its citizens who live in Germany without residence permits in
exchange for $140 million in German aid.  The agreement called for returning
2,500 Vietnamese in 1995, and 5,000 in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 96,032 Vietnamese registered in Germany's
Auslaenderzentralregister on December 31, 1995, including 38,166 without
residence permits.  Most of those to be returned to Vietnam are Vietnamese who
applied for asylum-- only 5,000 are former East German contract workers.  In
addition, there may be another 2,000 to 20,000 "illegal Vietnamese" in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Hanoi was criticized by the German government for delays in accepting
Vietnamese being returned from Germany.  So far, only 89 Vietnamese have been
returned, and 65 of them were convicted criminals sent home under a separate
clause of the July 1995 agreement that permits the expedited deportation of
criminals.  According to the German government, some 8,100 Vietnamese have
registered to go home.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam, which is also experiencing the return of 35,000 boat people in
southeast Asia, insists on verifying that all persons returning are Vietnamese.
Neighbors of Germany worry that, if the German government gets tough with the
Vietnamese staying in Germany, some may move to Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Ethnic Germans.</u>  On May 31, the German government promised to
continue to allow ethnic German migrants to enter the country.  The German
government announced that it would prefer that the 500,000 ethnic Germans
living in Kazakhastan remain there, but that they can migrate to Germany if
they must.  Over 200,000 ethnic Germans from Kazakhastan, where wages average
$100 per month, emigrated to Germany in 1994-95. </tt><p>
<tt>The head of Kazakhastan's Council of Germans has said that the discussion
in Germany about restricting ethnic German immigration has triggered a rush of
emigration from the country.  The opposition Social Democrats proposed limiting
the influx of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union.</tt><p>
<tt>According to reports, Foreign Minister Kinkel explained to a class of 20
young ethnic Germans that " roast chickens will not fly into your open mouths"
in Germany.  He then asked who wanted to remain in Kazakhastan, and only the
teacher did.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians.</u>  In June, 1996, Interior Minister Kanther announced that
the repatriation of Bosnians in Germany would be delayed from July 1, 1996 to
October 1, 1996.  The repatriation is expected to take 12 months.  However,
each of Germany's 16 states makes the decision on when to return Bosnians, so
that return policies can and do vary by state.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bosnian government has demanded that Germany help to pay for the cost
of resettling returning Bosnians, and that the government determine where in
Bosnia its returning Bosnians are sent.  Some of the one million Bosnians
outside Bosnia fear that if they vote in elections scheduled for September 14,
1996, they may lose their right to remain in the country where they are taking
refuge.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany anticipates an easier return of 130,000 persons to
Serbia/Yugoslavia.  The Yugoslav government is not demanding compensation to
accept the return of its nationals, and has said that young men who went to
Germany to avoid military service will not be punished.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market.</u>  On May 28, 1996, German employers rejected the
Entsendegesetz, a proposal to require foreign workers from other EU countries

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">British
Court Strikes Down Ban on Welfare</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A Court of Appeal on June 21 by a 2 to 1 vote struck down as
"uncompromisingly draconian" a rule that, beginning in February 1996, denied
welfare benefits to 8000 asylum seekers who did not apply for asylum upon their
arrival in the UK.  The purpose of the restriction was to save about L200
million per year.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the judges, the lack of benefits meant that it was "not merely
difficult but totally impossible for them to remain here to pursue their asylum
claims."  A High Court ruling dating in 1803 obliges the British government to
assist "poor foreigners" while their claims to settle in Britain were
determined.  Asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK, and private help
for them is limited, according to the ruling.</tt><p>
<tt>The ruling was, in effect, a finding that Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley had adopted regulations that went beyond the underlying law, and ordered
Lilley to review a denial of benefits to a 25 year old Zairean woman.  Lilley
said he feared the judgment would result in "a fresh flood of bogus claimants"
for asylum, and indicated that the decision would be appealed to the House of
Lords.  </tt><p>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard withdrew other rules also aimed at making it
harder for asylum seekers to remain in the UK.  Under the withdrawn rules,
asylum applicants could be removed from the UK if they made mistakes on the new
application forms.</tt><p>
<tt>In a report on the three million minority residents in the UK, the 212,000
black Africans were found to be the best educated, largely because restrictive
immigration policies keep out unskilled workers.  The 840,000 Indians and
477,000 Pakistanis in Britain are poised to become solid members of the middle
class, largely because of their high level of education.  The 500,000
Afro-Caribbean persons in the UK are mostly working class, working for wages
and living in social housing.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Home Office estimated that employers would spend 13.5 million
pounds verifying the legal right to work of newly-hired employees in the first
year, and then 11 million pounds per year.  The UK is considering introducing
employer sanctions.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC12">France</a></a></a></a></a>
Criticized on Asylum</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) in mid-June
criticized France for increasing the hurdles to asylum seekers.  It asked
France to grant asylum to Algerians who felt threatened by either the
government or fundamentalists.  The UN Human Rights Commission in April, 1996
made similar criticisms.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum requests in France has been falling, from 61,422 in
1989 to 20,170 in 1995.  About 24 percent of the asylum applications handled in
1994 were approved, versus 27 percent in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 15, some 5,000 to 10,000 people marched through Paris to demand an
amnesty in the form of residency rights for settled illegal migrants.  They
also demanded residency rights for illegal migrants who have married foreigners
legally resident in  France, and for illegal alien parents of children born in
France.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, is France's third biggest
party, after the ruling conservatives of President Jacques Chirac and the
Socialists.  The National Front blames the three million immigrants in France
for the country's 12 percent unemployment rate.  Le Pen continues to insist
that "One cannot make a French people from massive immigration... people need a
certain homogeneity...just because this immigration is done without weapons
doesn't mean it isn't an invasion."</tt><p>
<tt>When asked in a May 26, 1996 interview how many immigrants that France
should accept, Le Pen replied " Zero, zero, zero, excepting individual cases of
people who would have shown their merit regarding our country, who bring proof
of ties here."  Le Pen advocated in a speech talking about potential
immigrants: "Don't come to our country. We can't take you in and, henceforth,
you will not have access to any of the social advantages. If you want to come
here as tourists, we'd like that very much. But we can't pay for your
children's schools or your medical care. Not for any of it."</tt><p>
<tt>Morocco, a country of 29 million with a per capita income of $1000, expects
to receive about $1.2 billion in remittances in 1996, only half 1980s levels.
There are more than 2.1 million Moroccans living in Europe, most in France.
The country has become a natural transit point for African illegal immigrants
seeking to enter illegally into Europe.</tt><p>

<tt>In 1993, nearly one million foreigners were employed in Switzerland,
primarily in jobs described as the "three D's," --dirty, difficult and
dangerous.  Nearly 60 percent of the foreigners working in Switzerland are in
the construction industry, according to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs.
</tt><p>
<tt>Switzerland has among the most restrictive immigration laws on the
Continent.  Migrants are allowed to bring their families to the country only if
they can prove that they have enough money and housing.  Workers are not
allowed to change jobs unless there is a medical reason for doing so.  </tt><p>
<tt>Switzerland, which narrowly rejected a vote to join the European Economic
Area in 1992, is negotiating the free entry of EU nationals and a road
transport agreement with the EU.  Brussels wants the Swiss to eliminate work
permit quotas for EU citizens within three years and is prepared to concede a
safeguard clause allowing controls to be reimposed if there is a large influx
of illegal immigrants.  The Swiss government is willing to ease restrictions on
EU nationals followed by a possible abolition of work permit quotas and freedom
of movement for EU citizens within five years.  The Swiss foreign minister did
not promise that the talks with the EU would lead to the free circulation of
people along EU lines.  </tt><p>
<tt>The proposals were blasted by industrialist and SVP member of Parliament
Christoph Blocher, who said that any deals with Brussels on lifting immigration
limits must be voted by referendum of the Swiss voters. </tt><p>
<tt>The majority of the Swiss say they favor allowing EU nationals to live and
work in Switzerland without restrictions.  Even the four coalition parties,
employers and unions support unrestricted living and work for EU nationals.
</tt><p>
<tt>Should the Swiss government alienate public opinion during the trade
negations by moving too boldly, it could affect two referendums relating to
Europe expected to be voted on in Spring, 1998.  One referendum relates to a
pro-European bid to restart EEA talks and the other is the Blocher demand that
any negotiations on EU entry must get prior approval from the voters. </tt><p>

<tt>The Japanese government reported that the number of registered alien

record 1.09 percent of the country's population.  The number of North and South
Korean residents declined about 1.5 percent over 1994 levels, and their share
of the number of alien residents fell from 80 percent in 1985 to 64 percent in
1990, and to 48 percent in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Filipino residents dropped by 13 percent from the year
before, primarily due to a sharp fall in the number of people entering Japan
with permits to work as entertainers, such as singers and dancers. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners visiting Japan fell to 3.3 million in 1995, down
from a peak 3.6 million in 1992.  Japanese traveling abroad, by contrast,
jumped to 15.3 million.  Foreigners denied entry into Japan in 1995 at ports of
entry increased by 33 percent over 1994 levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese Justice Ministry announced on June 23 that there was a 15.5
percent decline in the number of illegal immigrants who were deported in 1995.
Of the 55,470 deported, 49,434 were illegally employed in Japan.  The Justice
Ministry attributes the decline in illegal employment to tighter controls and
fewer jobs due to a prolonged recession.  </tt><p>
<tt>Among the foreigners illegally employed in Japan, South Koreans were the
most numerous, followed by mainland Chinese, Thais and Filipinos.  Over 65
percent of the illegal workers were male.  About 40 percent of the illegally
employed females came from Thailand and the Philippines.  </tt><p>
<tt>Japan is considering allowing visa-free entry to holders of Hong Kong's

<tt>The Philippines, the major emigration nation in Asia, believes that there
are at least 5,000 illegal aliens living in the country who were granted visa
extensions in 1973, and then stayed in the country illegally after their
extended visas expired.  Most are believed to be businessmen with investments
in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines is offering an amnesty through the Alien Social Integration
Act for some of the estimated 70,000 illegal aliens in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines' Bureau of Immigration and Deportation announced on June 5
the creation of a special task force to process the amnesty applications of
undocumented residents.  The task force, composed of two immigration lawyers
and eight intelligence agents, will process applications from illegal aliens
with no criminal record who entered the country on or before June 30, 1991.
Each principal applicant will be required to pay US $7,923, spouses, US $2,154,
and children US $1,192.</tt><p>
<tt>Through the collection of fees, the task force hopes to raise 4 to 6
billion pesos by the end of the alien integration period of December 21, 1996.
As of June 1996, only 7,000 aliens applied for amnesty. </tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 13,000 Filipinos managed to leave Davao illegally for jobs in
Malaysia, Indonesia or Taiwan in 1996.  According to reports, many Filipinos
who pay money to smugglers to take them abroad lose their money when the
smuggler disappears before transporting them.</tt><p>
<tt>One report says that, in Davao, Filipinos are asked to pay 90,000 pesos (US
$3,440) for the chance to "directly work abroad," with a money-back guarantee
in case of problems.  In May, Philippine authorities seized an
Indonesian-registered boat carrying 24 Filipino workers without proper
permits.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite a Filipino government ban on the deployment of maids to Singapore,
Filipino domestic workers still head for that island nation.  The Filipino
government announced the ban after the hanging of Filipino domestic worker Flor
Contemplacion for murdering her employer.  A Filipino maid earns about S$280
per month in Singapore.  A Philippine government official says that between 100
to 200 Filipino maids arrive in Singapore each week.  A UN report indicates
that about 55 percent of the four to five million Filipinos working abroad are
women. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Council for Economic Planning and Development called for a limit on the
number of foreign laborers in Taiwan.  The CEPD reported that imported labor is
one of the main factors behind the increasing unemployment in the manufacturing
and construction sectors.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported that
unemployment was 2.25 percent in March, the highest rate in nine years.</tt><p>
<tt>The CEPD believes that there are signs that foreign workers are replacing
natives in the labor market.  Growing unemployment, the council reports, is
closely related to the increasing numbers of foreign workers on the island.  A
CEPD official notes that the number of foreign workers has increased sharply
since the beginning of the second half of 1995; at the same time, the
unemployment rate has grown significantly.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 29, a Council of Labor Affairs panel concluded that the ceiling for
foreign workers should be cut from the current 65 percent of a company's work
force to 50 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs is also planning to raise the vocational
stabilization fee that Taiwanese employers of foreign workers are charged.  The
vocational stabilization fund was set up in August 1992 to raise money to help
unemployed Taiwan workers, and to narrow the wage gap between local and foreign
workers. </tt><p>
<tt>One manufacturing representative proposed that the government set up a
special zone where only foreign workers would be hired in order to alleviate
labor shortages.  He reported that about 30,000 Taiwan companies have set up
operations on the Chinese mainland to take advantage of the lower labor and
land costs there.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 78,000 Taiwanese emigrated in 1995, versus 42,000 in 1994, mostly to
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</tt><p>

Has Skilled Labor Shortage</a></a></a></a></a>s
</a></h2>
<tt>One electronics industry estimate predicts that an additional 50,000
qualified engineers will be needed by 2000 in order to sustain the country's
industrial growth rate.  The skills shortage is expected to increase labor
costs. </tt><p>
<tt>The government argues that foreign companies are exaggerating the labor
shortage to persuade the government to allow more foreigners into the country.
The government adds that it is ready to admit foreigners to fill highly skilled
jobs, such as running wafer fabrication plants, but it is against any wider
relaxation of controls over foreign workers.  Some foreign managers complain
that, unless the labor shortages abate, their expansion will slow. </tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 650 Indonesian illegal immigrants detained in a Malaysian camp ended
a 28-hour hunger strike on June 19.  The Indonesians were protesting what they
called a "forced overstay" by the Malaysian authorities.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 3,000 Filipinos are currently in Malaysian jails for illegally
entering the country.  Immigration officials, and the Philippine military,
which has a joint border patrol agreement with Malaysia, said that up to 100
Filipinos enter Malaysia's eastern provinces each day.  According to the
Malaysian Foreign Affairs Department, there are about 80,000 Filipino nationals
in Malaysia, 90 percent of whom are Muslim Filipinos. </tt><p>
<tt>Spot checks of night market traders will be conducted in the state of
Selangar in order to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.  The Malaysian
government has found that a large number of illegal immigrants are conducting
business at night markets in Gombak, Jajang and Bangi.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Australia</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>n
Government Reacts to Immigration Poll</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 17, the Australian government announced that it will cut the intake
of refugees and humanitarian migrants from 15,000 to 12,000 in 1997, but
maintain overall immigration at 98,000.  The government will increase the
number of people accepted under family reunification and skilled categories by
3,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>The announcement follows the leaking of a confidential Cabinet report that
the government was considering cutting the humanitarian and refugee to 10,000.
</tt><p>
<tt>In June 16 by-elections in Australia's Blaxland, two anti-immigration
candidates garnered 22 percent of the vote, up from the 2.5 percent showing in
the federal elections just three months ago.  A report in the Sydney Morning
Herald says that the vote was not so much anti-immigrant, but an indication
that the Liberals and the Democrats decided not to contest the election.
</tt><p>
<tt>The report concludes that immigration is not a burning issue in the
country.  Other immigration critics say the results show that the major
political parties are out of step with public opinion on immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>According to the results of a Herald-AGB poll released on June 19,
Australians think their country is accepting too many immigrants, especially
from Asia.  About 65 percent of 2,063 people polled thought that immigration
was too high; three percent favored more immigration.  Some 88 percent said
there were too many Asian immigrants.  About 25 percent of immigrants come from
Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>A government official said that the poll accurately reflects the need to
improve the balance between the skills program and family reunification.</tt><p>
<tt>According to unpublished government estimates, the number of immigrants
entering Australia under the family reunification program is expected to jump
to 58,000 in 1996, up from 44,500 in 1995.  Much of this increase reflects the
surge in spouse or parent sponsorship by former Chinese students who
participated in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations.  About 37,000 students
were granted permanent residency in Australia.  </tt><p>
<tt>A recent report by Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population
Research shows that 50 percent of all arrivals to New South Wales come from
Asia, primarily Southeast Asia.  New South Wales is the most populous
Australian state, home to 33 percent of Australians.  In 1992, New South Wales
attracted 43 percent of Australia's immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Singaporeans in Australia doubled from 3,176 in 1976 to 6,397
in 1992, and the number of Malaysian immigrants increased ninefold, from 9,179
in 1966 to 84,000 in 1992.  Nearly 80 percent of the Malaysia immigrants are
ethnic Chinese.  Singaporeans and Malaysians typically enter the medical,
dental, architectural and engineering professions.  </tt><p>
<tt>The largest group of Asian immigrants are from Vietnam.  Most immigrants
from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia arrive as professionals or under
business immigration programs.  Most Vietnamese came as refugees, and are
credited with bringing Buddhism to Australia.  The Vietnamese and Chinese
migrants are in the lower socio-economic groups, and tend to cluster in
inner-city areas. </tt><p>
<tt>A report by Monash University found that an Australian government proposal
to block migrants from receiving welfare benefits for two years would reduce
short-term costs, but not prevent a long-term welfare problem.  The government
has proposed extending its six-month waiting period for immigrants to receive
welfare benefits.  Under the proposal, those entering under the refugee and
humanitarian program would still receive immediate access to benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>The report found that one-third of the recently arrived immigrants depend
on welfare payments after entering the country, and at lease 25 percent
continue to depend on welfare during their second year in the country. </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government is trying to pass new laws to stop the Human
Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission from telling detained illegal
immigrants about their rights.  Currently, the HREOC delivers sealed envelopes
to detained illegal immigrants spelling out their rights, including the right
to request an attorney.  By law, illegal immigrants can gain access to a lawyer
only if they make a specific request.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Immigration
Affects New Zealand Election</a></a></a></a></a>s
</a></h2>
<tt>Polls suggest that New Zealand might elect a part-native Maori, Winston
Peters, as an anti-Asian prime minister, and give a significant number of seats
to the three-year old New Zealand First (NZF) party on October 12, 1996.  A
June 1996 poll found that the ruling National Party had 43 percent support
among voters, NZF 25 percent and Labour 16 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Saying that "New Zealand should be for New Zealanders," Peters has called
for an immigration moratorium and limits on foreign investment.</tt><p>
<tt>New Zealand, which rarely receives international news coverage, finds
itself in the news because of the rise of the New Zealand First party's
immigration policies.  The Wall Street Journal, which has carried many
complimentary stories about the country's fee-market economic policies,
recently described New Zealand in an editorial as "the modern face of
anti-immigration discrimination." </tt><p>
<tt>The number of people applying to migrate to New Zealand fell dramatically
after the government changed immigration policies in October, 1995.  There were
only 11 applications in the business investor category between January and May,
1996, a 96 percent fall from the 330 business investor applicants for the same
period last year.  New business investment residents brought $394 million to
New Zealand in 1995, 82 percent was from North Asians.  The minimum investment
was raised to $750,000 last year, and with only 11 applicants, the total
amounts to only $8.2 million.  </tt><p>
<tt>New Zealand officials attribute some of the decline in business immigrant
applications to recent anti-immigrant comments by political candidates and new
regulations which require an applicant to own more than 25 percent of the
enterprise and pass an English language test. </tt><p>
<tt>Applicants in the general skills category were down 70 percent to 2,403 in
the first five months of 1996, versus 8,093 applicants in the same period of
1995.  The number of general immigration applications is increasing
month-by-month, with 306 in January 1996 to 642 in May.  </tt><p>
