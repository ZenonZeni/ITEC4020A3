<H2>Mutual Fund Investing<BR>
Cabot's Recommendations</H2>

The dramatic growth of the mutual fund industry over the past decade now means <i>there are many more mistakes a novice mutual fund investor can make</i>.  Instead of providing you with more information about the current status of your mutual fund holdings, I have chosen to review <b>some of the potential pitfalls</b> in mutual fund investing.  We are aware that there are many effective methods in investing.  However, Cabot has some very concrete ideas concerning mutual fund selection.  We speak from our experience and are fully aware that many will disagree. Here are three common mistakes in mutual fund investing:  
<P>
1.)  <b>Avoid investing in too many funds</b>.  Nearly once a week we weed through a new client’s mutual fund portfolio made up of 20 -25 different mutual funds.  This is far too many.  With this number of funds you will end up with an index type portfolio which tends to under-perform the market because of the fund’s fees.  What is the right number?  In our opinion three to five should usually do the trick for a growth fund investor.  And a conservative, bond-oriented investor really only needs two or three funds at the most.
<P>
2.)  <b>Avoid the now very popular buy and hold philosophy</b>.  The entire mutual fund industry has been singing the <i>"Buy and Hold Tune"</i> for better than ten years now.  And most investors and long-term mutual fund holders are now believers.  Why?  Because the market has been in a long rewarding bull market.  <i>Bear markets have not been wiped off the face of this earth.</i>  We will have another nasty bear market some day.  Ask investors in Japan if they know about bear markets.  They have had a terrible one for several years.  We expect to be able to achieve good performance for you by avoiding a good portion of the next bear market.  An important part of avoiding the next bear will be remaining on the lookout for a troubling market environment and moving to a highly defensive position at the right time.  Don’t believe the buy and "hope" mutual fund story, or you will probably end up singing the <i>"Buy and Hold Blues"</i>.
<P>
3.)  <b>Avoid investing in very large funds</b>. One of the first things we look for in selecting the Cabot mutual fund holdings is the size of the fund.  We think you should avoid most mutual funds with over $2 billion in assets.  Why?  It’s simple math.  In our stock accounts, we like to hold positions in stocks we really like to around 5%.  In a two billion dollar fund a 5% position would be $100 million.  This size position can only be purchased in the largest 5 to 10% of companies in nearly all markets.  This means the best companies with the most growth prospects are eliminated from the buy list.  <i>In the business of investing, a very large asset size tends to reduce performance.</i> Therefore, try to concentrate on great managers that have not been fully exploited.  Many of our favorite funds are in the $100 - $200 million size and the largest is $2 billion.  Accordingly, we suggest you avoid S&P 500 and DJIA index funds.
