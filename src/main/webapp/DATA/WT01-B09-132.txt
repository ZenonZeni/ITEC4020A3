<B>Project Title:  Hybrid Electric Bus Development & Demonstration<p>

Performing Organization:   Delphi Energy & Engine Management Systems, Allison Transmission Division of GMC, Delco Propulsion Systems</B><p>

Technical POC: Dick VanderKolk, Delphi­E, (317) 579­4971<br>
Jim Ordo, ATD, (317) 242­5660

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The goal is to push the series hybrid electric drive propulsion system closer to production by
advancing component, sub­system, and system technologies. This was accomplished, in part, by leveraging work
already done on prior programs such as the GM Impact and the "Indy Shuttle" bus program. This technology
advancement will be demonstrated by placing buses in regular service at sites in Chattanooga and Indianapolis. A third
bus will be retained by the Allison/Delphi team for further development work.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Integrate purpose built hybrid, electric drive propulsion systems into three 22­foot shuttle buses, test, and operate at customer sites</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P><UL><LI>Testing of busses at GM Proving Grounds and customer sites in Chattanooga and Indianapolis through 12/3196.</UL></P>
