<BR>
The following is an excerpt from the Foreword of the CSIRO Earth Observation
Centre's <A HREF="../eoc/eocpln1.htm">Science Plan</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>In the period between now and the year 2000, Australia is set to be
part of a rapid development of Earth Observation technology and opportunities.
The application of Earth observing technologies throughout our region and
the world will be a major activity as resource and environmental assessment
and monitoring is done at many scales and over vast areas of the land and
ocean. <BR>
<BR>
Australia will certainly be a developer of advanced methods and technologies
for Earth Observation, surveillance and monitoring from satellite and aircraft
platforms and may have a developing satellite launch, sensors, and services
industry. In addition, in an era of data encryption and 'closeable' skies,
Australia will need to gather, process and interpret a significant amount
of its own resource and environmental data and information. 
<H3>Taking charge of innovation</H3>
In order to show leadership in this area, Australian scientists and industry
must decide that we are to be more than a launch site provider, data consumer
and user of other nations' technology. We must 'take charge' of the innovation
that is needed to own the advances that will emerge. Industry and scientists
must work together to make the results of research create competitive advantages
through products having the highest quality and meeting the strictest international
standards. Showing national leadership in this task is a role CSIRO can
and should take.<BR>
<BR>
The need for a CSIRO Earth Observation Centre (EOC) has developed as the
value of focusing the skills of CSIRO scientists in Earth Observation Science
has become clear and the disadvantages of dispersed activities have become
patent. Modern Earth observing research has advanced from description, data
gathering and exploratory image processing to a point where the value of
remote sensing data as measurements is paramount. Remotely sensed measurements
can be collected in a range of data dimensions and at time and space scales
which cannot be accessed in any other way. <BR>
<BR>
This has enabled geographical applications of Earth Observation to proceed
in terms of scientific models and process understanding. The physical link
between the data and the parameters of interest to users is providing the
returns that previous image processing and 'correlation' based approaches
could only suggest as being possible. In the generic development of this
opportunity, the CSIRO EOC can create a base of knowledge that will underpin
remote sensing applications in CSIRO Divisions, and build competitive advantage
for value-adding industry. 
<H3>Focus on generic Earth Observation science</H3>
In 1994&shyp;95, an extended review of CSIRO's efforts in Earth observation
data use was carried out under the chairmanship of Dr James Simpson of the
University of California in San Diego (COSSA Publication 034). This review
recommended greater collaboration and rationalisation plus much greater
emphasis on algorithm development and value adding. In the pursuit of the
Report's primary recommendation, to form an EOC, it was realised that the
need for focus and collaboration extended well beyond data acquisition-which
is, in the end, primarily an Agency responsibility. The development of an
EOC founded on generic, multi-disciplinary and cross-Divisional issues including
scene and atmospheric measurement models and algorithms was perceived as
a basis for developing collaboration and rationalisation throughout the
Earth Observation activities of CSIRO. EOC projects will be outcome orientated
and collaborative, with the outcomes owned by all of the participating groups.
The move to form an EOC has recognised that there are issues of Earth Observation
science that are common to many groups and that focusing teams on resolving
these issues was vital to the needs of all, but beyond the capacity of any
one current group.<BR>
<BR>
In particular, the need for special focus on generic Earth Observation science
is paramount to the successful development of clients and markets addressed
by CSIRO Divisions and the Australian product delivery industry. These developments
and client acceptance of the products are currently highly sensitive to
the quality of the data products and value adding and hence to focused input
from the base of excellent scientists that CSIRO has in Earth Observation.
The 'delivery ratio' of generic research to market satisfaction can be very
high. CSIRO has an opportunity for niche development in generic Earth Observation
science and the provision of Best Practice methods which have immediate
payoffs in environmental and resource applications and to the developing
space and aircraft based mapping and monitoring industries. 
<H3>Science Plan</H3>
A Science Plan has been developed and has been discussed widely in CSIRO.
The Plan has taken the input material and the responses of scientists and
groups interested in the EOC. <BR>
<BR>
The Plan seeks to help Australia's efforts in the field of Earth Observation
from space and aircraft platforms. One of the Centre's objectives is for
the associated services industries to be recognised and successful throughout
our region and a leader in worldwide applications. It provides a means for
CSIRO excellence becoming standard practice in the industries addressed
by CSIRO Divisions and in the information delivery industry that Australia
will continue to develop in the coming years. <BR>
