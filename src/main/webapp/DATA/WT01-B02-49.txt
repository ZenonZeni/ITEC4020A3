<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>IGARSS'94 Welcome</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><H1>Welcome to IGARSS `94</H1><P> We invite you to attend the 1994 International  Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (lGARSS'94)  on August 8-12 at the California Institute of Technology,  Pasadena, California. IGARSS'94 is hosted by the Jet   Propulsion laboratory and jointly sponsored by the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE), Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS), the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), and, for the  first time, the Optical Society of America (OSA). We are  also fortunate to have the California Space Institute as a participant this year.<P> The theme for 1994, "Surface and Atmospheric Remote Sensing: Technologies, Data Analysis,  and Interpretation," reflects the need to view the Earth as a system of interrelated atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic processes. Plenary sessions will focus on the models, technologies, missions, and policies that will further our understanding of the environment and its resources. More than sixty technical sessions, including both oral and interactive papers, will provide more detailed presentations on these and other relevant topics.<P> New this year will be"The User's Guide to the Data," an interactive series of exhibits, hands-on demonstrations,  and presentations on the latest in data analysis and visualization. In addition, the lGARSS'94 Digest will be available on CD-ROM, as well as in the traditional book format for those of you who need the exercise. And, as always, we will hold the annual baseball and soccer games in the lGARSS tradition.<P>Pasadena, best known as the home of the Rose Bowl ad Rose Parade, is the site of well-known sporting events (including the finals for the World Cup this year), world-class museums and theaters, and historic architecture. With its sunny, warm climate, Southern California provides the opportunity for a myriad of activities, from Santa Monica Beach to the San Gabriel Mountains to the happiest place on Earth:  Disneyland.                                    <P>We look forward to seeing you in August!
