A Reconnaissance Trip to Micronesia<BR>
<I>by Jack Grove</I>

<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>Originally we had plans to publish the full report of Jack's reconnaissance trip of last November to the islands of Yap and Palau. Not surprising, his report was much too long to include it in full in this edition of Zegrahm News. Following are Jack's encounters in Palau, while excerpts from Yap Island will follow in one of the next newsletters.</I><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My arrival in Palau was unexpectedly delayed, compliments of typhoon Dale which pounded Guam (515 miles to the northeast) canceling flights to Palau. Although these storms <IMG SRC="mantara.gif" ALT="mantara.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=1 WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133> rarely hit either Yap or Palau, while I cooled my heels I reflected gratefully that our expeditions were scheduled well after the typhoon season.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the seven underwater wonders of the world, Palau is situated some 450 miles east of the Philippines in the western Caroline Islands. Officially declared an independent nation in October of 1994, the archipelago is home to 15,000 people, 700 different kinds of corals and more than 1,400 species of fishes (compare that figure to "just" 444 species of fish known from the Galapagos). Often referred to as the most beautiful of Micronesian destinations, only nine of Palau's 343 islands are inhabited, and the area is renowned by scuba divers and snorkelers worldwide. I had to remind myself a couple of times that, as this was a reconnaissance trip, I could not spend all of my time fish-watching! Organizing itinerary details, meeting with tour operators and hotel managers, and familiarizing myself with all aspects of the natural history kept me above sea level for part of every day. I was especially anxious to continue my congenial rivalry with "birdman," Peter Harrison, by compiling and sending him a list of the endemic birds I had seen.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Palau is to snorkelers and divers what the Serengeti is to safari enthusiasts. The typhoon delay, and the lengthy hours in various planes, were quickly forgotten as the luxury dive boat <I>Sun Dancer</I>, <IMG SRC="fish1.gif" ALT="fish1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=114>with me aboard, motored across Molokai Harbor to our first dive site. Although I had made several dives here on an expedition a decade ago, this was my first live-aboard dive adventure in Palau, and the ensuing days were full of highlights. The western portion of Palau's barrier reef was once above sea level. Centuries of storm waves, combined with the erosive forces of ocean currents, have created a maze of caverns and channels in the limestone shore. Subsequently, the coastline sank into the depths, creating a wonderland of vertical chimneys - or Blue Holes - connecting these caverns to the surface. One such cavern has become a fabled site where divers enter the open face of the cavern along the vertical submarine wall. Ethereal light penetrates into the huge chamber through the chimneys. As we descended in a three knot current, the drift carried us along the vertical wall. A 300 pound Napoleon wrasse - named Al by local guides - approached to within a few feet and peered into my mask. Grey reef sharks moved effortlessly into the current as I drifted by. Entering the submarine labyrinth at one hundred feet, beams of sunlight penetrated the crystal clear waters to the sand floor, illuminating myriad soft corals. The scene was breathtaking, I could make a hundred dives at this site and never grow tired of it.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where the Philippine Sea meets the tip of Palau's western barrier reef, a coral encrusted, limestone wall penetrates the blue waters. The nutrient rich waters which sweep around the <B>Blue Corner</B> nourish an astounding array of marine life: a school of blackfin barracuda that encircled me was so dense it blocked the sun. Knowing that the tender from the diveboat would follow our drift, my dive buddy and I moved through this underwater wonderland in awe, carried along by the steady current. Two huge tuna sped past me like bullets, and schools of snapper, basselets and unicornfish added color to the aquatic panorama. Even if there had been no fish, the profusion of invertebrates and coral would make this a one of the world's finest dive sites.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="fish2.gif" ALT="fish2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>The island of Ngercheuis is legendary in Palauan history because of the hawksbill turtles which once came ashore to nest on its pristine beaches. Today these turtles are rare, even in Palau. But the legends - and a dive site called <B>Turtle Cove</B> - live on. Only a few hundred yards off the secluded beaches of Ngercheuis lies one of the most luxuriant coral reefs anywhere. It will dazzle even the most jaded of snorkelers and divers. Purple soft corals and brilliant red-whip corals adorn the reef and appear even more brilliant to the snorkeler in shallow water. Golden lace-like sea fans spread out along the wall in colonies, many six feet or more in height. Sponges and reef-building corals provide protection for schools of bigeyes and squirrelfish. I could hardly imagine what this place would look like on a night dive with the coral polyps wide open and the nocturnal fishes out of their hiding places to feed. When the opportunity arose, it surpassed my expectations.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly 40 Japanese ships were sunk at Palau during the American airstrike in March, 1944, and most lie in the protected waters of the inner lagoon. I had an opportunity to dive several of these ship wrecks, and each is a story unto itself. Unlike outside the lagoon where visibility is 100 - 150 feet, here the visibility was only about 30 feet and the top of the rigging of the <I>Iro Maru</I> - Japanese oil tanker and munitions carrier - could barely be seen from the surface. The juxtaposition of a sunken warship and living marine habitat is for most divers the most striking aspect of a wreck dive. The Iro was no exception. A beautiful barrel anemone had made its home atop the center kingpost of the ship, and in it were a dozen skunk clownfish. Making my descent onto the main deck, the spectacles of schooling fishes and whip corals were everywhere. On the foredeck, beneath a 5.5 inch gun with a massive barrel extending well beyond the prow, was an encrusted sake bottle inhabited by a banded shrimp.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="moorish.gif" ALT="moorish.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169>My scouting almost complete, I took the opportunity for a sightseeing flight with a helicopter. Moments after the aircraft took off from Koror airport, a surreal seascape unfolded below me unlike anything I had ever seen. Limestone islets sculpted into conical forms by the ages, each carpeted with lush vegetation spread out across the turquoise seas. Many of the islands are skirted with shallow water and white sands, others are bordered by a drop-off, where the sea turns abruptly to deep blue. The flight afforded the most awesome aerial spectacle I had ever encountered in any type of aircraft, anywhere in the world.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My Micronesia experience was a series of breathtaking images - from beneath the waves, the shores of hospitable islands and from the air. While time, for me, tends to speed by too quickly, I am already anxious for the days and months to pass so that I can return to this paradise in early 1998!<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>We will offer two snorkeling and culture expeditions to Yap and Palau. Jack will also lead a dive trip for "hard core" divers. A brochure for these January and February 1998 Micronesia expeditions will be ready in the spring. In the meantime, a lengthy interest list is forming. If you would like to be on it, call Tony.</I>
