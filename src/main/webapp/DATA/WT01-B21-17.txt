</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Although the Tellegen Absorption Scale
has been widely employed in recent years as a measure of
personality Trait Absorption, it is argued that this simple score
does not sufficiently discriminate true capacity for Absorption
nor does it reveal the level of opportunity made for absorptive
experiencing. This study operationalizes Capacity and Opportunity
as two additional subscales appended to the Tellegen scale and,
by employing the technique of Principal Components Analysis, five
useful sub-dimensions are generated. Following on from this
Author's earlier suggestion that personality Trait Absorption may
be linked to cannabis use and depression, an exploratory study
was conducted into the relationship of cannabis use, gender,
self-perceived motivation loss and depression to observed levels
of overall Absorption as well as to levels of Capacity and
Opportunity for absorptive experiencing.<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">In recent years absorption has become
increasingly popular as a psychological construct [1]. This
conception of attentional deployment, now interpreted and
codified as a personality trait [2, 3, 4], has found its way into
research areas as diverse as aesthetics [5, 6], hypnosis [7, 8,
9, 10], psychopathology [11], religious behavior [12, 13],
altered states of consciousness [14, 15, 16, 17, 18],
parapsychological phenomena [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],
intelligence [25], illicit drug use [26, 27], dissociative states
[28, 29] and medicine [30, 31, 32]. Individuals higher in Trait
Absorption appear to manifest a fundamental need to experience
the phenomenal world in a manner which totally engages
attentional resources in an intrinsically self-rewarding way.
Tellegen and Atkinson describe the absorptive experience as an
&quot;'allocentric' perceptual mode...involving 'totality of
interest', and openness to the object in all its aspects with all
one's senses&quot; [1, p.221]. Further, this attentional style is
total, &quot;involving a full commitment of available perceptual,
motoric, imaginative and ideational resources to a unified
representation of the attentional object&quot; (p.274).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Irwin has argued that Absorption must be
seen not only as an innate capacity for a particular mode of
attentional deployment, but should be understood as comprising
three sub-dimensions: 'need' for absorptive experience;
'opportunity' made for these experiences, as well as one's
overall capacity to have such experiences [21]. He accepts that
the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS) of the Differential
Personality Questionnaire [2] is such a measure of 'capacity' and
he links 'opportunity' to 'need', which is operationalized as a
slightly reworded form of the original TAS. Irwin's resultant
Need for Absorption Scale (NAS) requires Ss to rate, as either
'true' or 'false', the assertion that they 'enjoy' each of the
items of the TAS rather than simply indicating whether they
experience them or not. However, the connection between enjoying
a particular experience and 'need' for that experience remains
unclear in this formulation. In addition, Irwin's approach fails
to address precisely the issue of 'opportunity' which, logically,
only can be interpreted as the frequency of engagement in
absorptive states which is not assessed in either the TAS or the
NAS.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Although it is widely accepted that the
TAS provides a read-out of overall 'capacity' for Trait
Absorption, the items, being true or false statements, fail to
discriminate either the frequency of occurrence or the ease of
access with which individuals experience the phenomenon of each
item. In other words, when answering 'true' to a given Absorption
item, there is no indication made whether this experience
happened once in a life-time or everyday and, further, it is not
possible to ascertain whether an S finds it easy or difficult to
access the phenomena represented by a given TAS item. Thus, two
Absorption high-scorers may be, in fact, quite different both in
their rate of absorptive participation and in their innate
abilities.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Such a shortcoming suggests a need to
expand the items of the TAS in order to obtain, not only a
reading of simple Absorption level, but measures of both
frequency (Opportunity) and ease of engagement (Capacity) as
well. This paper reports the results of using just such an
expanded scale in an exploratory empirical study of the
relationship of Trait Absorption to cannabis use and the related
factors of gender, self-assessed loss of motivation and
self-assessed frequency of depression. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">There appears to be very little in the
literature regarding these issues, but in relation to cannabis,
it recently has been argued that the preference of users for the
drug may be a direct consequence of the ability of the active
ingredient, _-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, to facilitate
self-rewarding absorptive and 'flow' cognitive/affective states
[26, 33]. It has been further suggested that the use of cannabis
may be an attempt to redress an imbalance in cognitive and
affective 'style' in which active, discursive, logico-deductive
cognitive activities are replaced by more passive, absorptive and
flow styles of attention and conscious participation. From this
perspective cannabis use may reflect a means for individuals with
higher levels of Trait Absorption, and who have a preference for
such states, to gain greater access to this attentional mode.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">It thus would seem likely that amongst
regular users of cannabis a higher overall level of personality
trait absorption might be observed. It has been asserted that the
urge to use the drug may arise in some users from &quot;a primary
psychological need which far outweighs the power of those sorts
of external pressures&quot; [26, p. 44] which mitigate against
illicit drug use. This need also may manifest itself in a
preference for cannabis use in that the drug may enhance the
Capacity as well as increase the Opportunity to experience states
of flow and absorption. What follows is a description and
analysis of an exploratory questionnaire designed to assess these
issues.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>METHOD</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">A multi-purpose questionnaire containing
items for several different research projects was administered to
undergraduate students at the Lismore and Coffs Harbour campuses
of Southern Cross University (SCU) as well as to a few members of
the surrounding community in the Northern Rivers district of New
South Wales, Australia. The overwhelming majority of respondents
were undergraduates (98.9%) who were taking Introductory
Psychology during the period 1993-94. This psychology class
serves not only the psychology major at SCU, but was, at the
time, a core subject for Paralegal Studies, Human Movement
Science, Business, general Social Science and Arts majors as
well. Thus, the sample obtained is not dominated by psychology
majors only and more closely represents the student population of
SCU than do the usual collocations of undergraduates drawn from
introductory psychology courses.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The first part of the questionnaire
included some standard demographic items and in regard to the
research being reported herein information was obtained regarding
self-assessments of depression, loss of motivation for daily
chores and frequency of cannabis use. The questions used for
assessing cannabis intake were the same as those employed by the
1991 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) bi-annual
national survey of Australian substance use [34]. A system for
guaranteeing anonymity was employed such that no one, including
the primary investigator, could ascertain the identity of
respondents thus ensuring reasonably honest replies to the
cannabis questions.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The last section consisted of the 34
item Tellegen Absorption Scale [2]. Each item of this scale
requires a 'true' or 'false' response and if a subject answered
'true' to any of these, s/he was instructed to answer two more
questions appended to each of the TAS items. These two additional
questions were designed to ascertain: 1) Approximately how
frequently Ss engaged in the given TAS activity (creation of
Opportunity for absorptive activities); and 2) how easy is it for
the respondent to do so (Capacity for engaging in these kinds of
experiences). Subjects were required to circle a single number
from 0-10 indicating ranges from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;all
the time&quot; for Opportunity and &quot;difficult&quot; to
&quot;easy&quot; for Capacity. Unlike the study by Fabian and
Fishkin [27], Ss were not instructed to reference the cannabis
intoxicated state when evaluating the TAS items, but to make
their self-evaluations based on how they are in their usual
day-to-day state.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Participation in the research was
voluntary, but a 10% increase in a subject's final grade was
offered as an incentive for taking part. As a result there was
better than 99% participation rate for all classes surveyed.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>RESULTS</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">A total of 272 questionnaires were
returned in usable form. Of these 74.6% are women and 25.4% men
with a mean age for the entire group of 24.8 years (Median = 20,
SD = 8.9, Range: 17-56). The mean age for women is 25 years
(Median = 20, SD = 9.2, Range: 17-56) and for men 23.9 years
(Median = 20, SD = 7.8, Range: 18-49), the difference being
non-significant but reflecting the predominance of women amongst
the mature-age students. Although there is a good representation
of older students in the Southern Cross University population,
68.5% of the current sample is 25 years or younger in this
sample.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The large ratio of women to men is
accounted for by the fact that the largest single group of
students in this study is enrolled in the Bachelor of Social
Science degree (40.8%) and these students are predominantly
female (81.1%). In addition, Psychology is a favored elective for
those students completing the Associate Degree in Paralegal
Studies (12.9% of sample) and this course of study is generally
favored by women as well (91.4% in this sample). In general,
where psychology is taken as an elective, it is more likely to be
taken by women and in this study the students listing 'Other'
(other than Social Science, Business, Law, Paralegal) as their
course of study are 74% female.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS:
OPPORTUNITY AND CAPACITY FOR ABSORPTION</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">For each case the total Absorption score
was calculated as the sum of all the 'true' responses made to the
primary Tellegen Absorption items [2]. This is typically the
Absorption score (TAS) reported in the literature and has a range
of 0-34. In addition, the totals for all Opportunity and Capacity
sub-items for each case were calculated yielding Total Absorption
Opportunity (TAO) (range/0-340) and Total Absorption Capacity
(TAC) (range/0-340) scores. Next, the individual items for
assessing Opportunity and Capacity for Absorption were used in
the generation of two separate Principal Components Analyses
(PCA). This technique was employed to ascertain the existence of
any empirically-based higher order components which would be
conceptually useful in addition to the three overall Absorption
totals [35]. Varimax rotation was applied and Scree plots of the
resultant eigen-values were made for both sets of variables [36].
Although the first 8 and 10 values for Opportunity and Capacity,
respectively, were greater than one, there was a clear 'break' in
each plot at the second eigen-value, so two-component models
seemed to be indicated in both cases. Although a two-component
solution yielded a conceptually sound grouping for Opportunity, a
three-component model appeared more conceptually appropriate in
the case of Capacity and was thus adopted.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The results of the PCA for Absorption
Opportunity lists the Tellegen items with their respective
loadings for the two rotated components which have been named
'Immersed Entrancement' (Component 1 - C1AO) and
'Intuitive/Imaginative Knowing' (Component 2 - C2AO) and together
account for almost one third of the explained variance (see Table
1). Variables with a loading coefficient of 0.320 (about 10% of
variance) or greater were included in the naming process. Only
variable 13 (&quot;If I wish I can imagine that my body is so
heavy that I could not move it if I wanted to&quot;) did not
reach this criterion on either component, but, since it was
close, was also included in the table.<br>

<p><font size="1">Component 2. - Intuitive/imaginative knowing.
(C2AO)</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#000000">Many of the loadings in the first
component relate to items which ask the subject if s/he engages
in acts of interoceptive or exteroceptive immersion in and
entrancement by thoughts, feelings, nature, sunsets, art, music,
people, etc. Some of the items which load in Component 1 have
synesthetic qualities as well, but it can be argued that
immersion and/or entrancement is fundamental to this type of
experience. Component 2 is composed of items which ask Ss whether
they have imaginal and/or intuitive experiences. The former types
can include episodes of entering into states in which one
experiences the present as one did in childhood or states in
which one can &quot;step outside&quot; oneself in order to
experience the world differently. The latter includes sensing
presences who are not veridically present, knowing what is going
to be said next before hearing it, and intuiting events and
meanings not yet evident to others.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Three items in this analysis appear to
load fairly evenly across both components: 8, 'Understanding
Mystical Experiences', 7, 'Absorbed in Daydream', and 32, 'Images
easily appear'. In items 7 and 32 it is not difficult to see that
there are both immersion and imaginal components to these
activities. But this is not as clear for item 8 which asks
respondents to indicate whether or not they know what others mean
when they refer to mystical experiences.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The second PCA calculated for the
Absorption Capacity items yielded a three component solution (see
Table 2). In this case more than a third of the total variance
was explained and variables loading with a coefficient of 0.370
or higher were used in naming the components. The first component
is called 'Exteroceptive Imaginal Entrancement' (C1AC) and
includes immersion in external stimuli such as sunsets, nature,
music, etc. which can contribute to imaginal experiences such as
synesthesia, seeing shapes in free-form stimuli such as clouds,
or 'becoming' a character in a play. The second component has
been labeled 'Intuitive/Extrasensory Perceptions' (C2AC) and is
associated with the belief that one has precognitive perceptions,
senses presences not there is a physical way, can step into a
radically different reality frame and can perceive meanings where
others cannot. Component 3 has been called 'Interoceptive
Imaginal Entrancement' (C3AC) because of its focus on
introspective and reflective immersion on phenomena such as one's
daydreams, inner images, memories and thoughts.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">In this last PCA only two items load
with approximately equal strength across more than one component.
Variable number 2, 'Moved by eloquent language' loads
significantly on both components 1 and 3. This item appears to
have two aspects in that one becomes exteroceptively immersed
and/or entranced while attending to the external stimuli of
someone's words while, at the same time, these stimuli may evoke
associations, memories and fantasies which then become an inward
part of the total immersion experience. In the case of variable
8, 'I think I really know what some people mean when they talk
about mystical experiences', it appears to be connected both to
external stimuli (other people talking about mysticism) and to
intuitively perceiving, in that the experience itself is an
intuitive encounter.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">When asked whether Ss had ever tried
cannabis at least once, 75% of the sample responded in the
affirmative with the rate being only marginally higher for men
than for women (see Table 3). The sample showed no statistically
significant dependency between gender and ever having tried
cannabis. The mean age for those had tried cannabis is 24.8 years
and for those who had never tried it, 24.7 years. To the NCADA
question, &quot;When did you last use marijuana or hashish?&quot;
51% responded that they were regular users and, again, there was
no dependency relationship between gender and the responses to
this question.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">It is interesting to note that almost 6%
of those responding to the questionnaire during class time were
actually intoxicated on cannabis at the time and over 8% had last
used it the day before and were therefore likely to be showing
some effects from the drug because of its relatively long
half-life (5-7 days) [33]. The 'try' and 'use' rates reported in
this study are more than twice the national averages which may be
accounted for by the fact that this is not a random sample of the
local population, but a student sample, and, in addition, the
Northern Rivers District of New South Wales has a reputation for
being the center of Australia's 'alternative' subculture.
Responses also indicate that men (64.1%) are more likely to be
current users of cannabis than women (46.3%).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">From a combined score derived from the
NCADA queries: &quot;When did you last use marijuana or
hashish?&quot; and &quot;During your last period of usage of
marijuana or hashish, how often did you use it?&quot; and with
the addition of the question, &quot;On the days you used
marijuana or hashish, how often did you use it?&quot; Ss were
categorized as being in one of three groups: Never-Used,
Past-Users, or Current-Users (see Table 4) [34]. Past-Users were
considered to be those who last had used marijuana or hashish
more than one month ago and at that time their consumption rate
was one use per month or less on average. Current-Users are those
who had used within the past month or more recently and had
consumed at a rate of one per month or more. Again, there was no
statistically significant dependency between gender and use level
when use rate was partitioned in this manner. <br>

<p><font color="#000000">A more discriminating break-down of use
was attempted by dividing the Ss into 'regular', 'irregular',
'past' and non-users, because it was felt that there may be a
personality difference between the high and low ends of the user
spectrum. However, this breakdown produced very little
statistical discrimination between these two user groups on any
of the tests reported in this paper. Therefore, based on sample
size and the self-report nature of this research, a decision was
taken to combine the user subgroups in order to give greater
simplicity and strength to the statistical analysis. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Following on, all component scores,
together with the three total Absorption scores, were used as
dependent variables in the calculation of univariate ANOVAs
across the independent variable of Gender. The results of these
analyses for significant effects are given in Table 5. From these
calculations it appears that both TAS and TAC show only
borderline significantly higher mean scores for women whereas in
the case of TAO and C2AO the differences are stronger. For this
sample it would seem that the primary difference across gender is
the greater emphasis by women for making more opportunities for
absorptive states and particularly those of an
intuitive/imaginative type (C2AO).<br>

<p><font color="#000000">Next, univariate ANOVAs were calculated
across the cannabis use factor for all of the Absorption total
scores and component scores. The results indicate a strong
statistically significant difference across all three total
Absorption scores (see Table 6). From the post hoc tests
performed it is evident the meaningful differences in mean scores
for all three are to be found between the Current-User group and
either of the other two with current users always showing higher
overall TAS, TAO and TAC scores.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Scores for both components of the
Opportunity PCA show statistical significance across the levels
of cannabis use with post hoc tests revealing that, as in the
case of the total scores above, the real difference in means
occurs between Current-Users and either of the other two groups.
C2AO, 'Intuitive/Imaginative Knowing', yields a considerably
smaller probability of a Type I error than C1AO and can thus be
taken as the more important dimension when identifying
differences between the user groups. From this analysis it seems
that opportunities made (frequency) for absorptive activities
emphasize more the achievement of intuitive and imaginative
experiences although immersion, intero- and exteroceptively, is
also important when comparing current to past and non-users. <br>

<p><font color="#000000">In the analysis of the Capacity
components, only C1AC ('Exteroceptive imaginal entrancement') and
C3AC ('Interoceptive imaginal entrancement') show statistical
significance. Here we have a reversal in emphasis from the case
of Absorption Opportunity. In the case of C1AC the primary
difference is to be found between Current-Users and Non-Users
whereas with C3AC it is between Current-Users and Past-Users.
These results seem to indicate that differences between current
cannabis users and the other groups on the Capacity dimension are
best distinguished through immersion and entrancement activities.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">Following the univariate studies of
Absorption across the individual factors of gender and cannabis,
a two-way ANOVA was calculated for all Absorption variables
across both these independent variables looking for interaction
effects. However, only C1AC gives a statistically significant
interaction (F(2,266) = 3.2740, p = 0.0394). The interaction plot
of cell means (see Figure 1) clearly shows that women, who either
never used cannabis or are past users, have higher 'exteroceptive
imaginal entrancement' capacity than men (of those user
categories) with the female past users showing a statistically
significantly higher mean C1AC score than male past users (p =
0.005) or male non-users (p = 0.02). Male and female current
users are very similar in mean C1AC as well as are female non-,
past and current users. However, male current users show
significantly higher exteroceptive absorption capacity than
either never using or past using men (p = 0.007 and p = 0.002,
respectively). This analysis would tend to confirm that, in
general, women have significantly more capacity for exteroceptive
absorption except in the case of current users of cannabis where
men show a slightly higher mean score. <br>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>SELF-PERCEIVED MOTIVATION LOSS,
CANNABIS USE AND ABSORPTION</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">As indicated previously all participants
were asked to rate items regarding self-perceived levels of
motivation loss (&quot;Do you find that you lack motivation for
the normal chores and activities required of your daily
life?&quot;). When a cross-tabulation is calculated for
motivation loss and rate of cannabis use, a statistically
significant dependency relationship is observed (Chi-square =
12.21, 4 df, p = 0.0158). However, two cells of the resultant
table have fewer than 5 items, thus the relationship cannot be
considered entirely reliable even though the chance of a Type I
error is less than 2% (see Table 7). Nevertheless, it is evident
from observing this table that Current Users are almost 50% more
likely to place themselves in the highest motivation loss rank
than either Never or Past Users. In addition, Current Users are
about three times more likely to categorize themselves at the
highest level of motivation loss than at the other two motivation
ranks combined. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Those Ss who see themselves as never
showing a loss of motivation are 4-5 times more likely to be
Never or Past Users of cannabis than Current Users while those
who believe that they rarely lose motivation are fairly equally
distributed across the three levels of cannabis use. On the other
hand, those Ss who rank themselves as more regularly experiencing
motivation loss are more than twice as likely to be current
cannabis users as opposed to non-users and about 1.7 times more
likely to be Current Users than Past Users. Clearly, in spite of
the weakness of some of the cells, there appears to be a direct
dependency between cannabis use and self-perceived motivation
loss with increasing use associated with decreasing motivation in
this sample.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">Univariate ANOVAs for all Absorption
variables were calculated across the factor of Self-Perceived
Loss of Motivation and the significant results are given in Table
8. For all three total Absorption scores (TAS, TAO and TAC)
significant differences were found with those who report more
motivation loss showing the higher levels of Absorption. Post hoc
tests reveal the differences primarily are due to the greater
Absorption means for those who lose motivation more often as
opposed to Rarely. Of the three total scores TAO shows the
highest F-ratio suggesting that those who make more opportunity
for absorptive states are most differentiated from the others.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">Analysis of the component scores yields
significance only for C2AO and C3AC. The pattern of difference is
similar to that for the total scores and appears to indicate that
the greater Opportunity made is in the realm of the imaginal and
the higher level of Capacity is for interoceptive experience.
However, all these results for motivation loss must be considered
somewhat weak when taken in the light of the great disparity in
cell sizes (10, 88, 174) and thus would require a larger sample
to confirm.</font> </p>

scores were used as dependent variables in univariate ANOVAs
across the factor of Depression (see Table 10). For the group of
total Absorption scores the significances for differences in cell
means are quite strong with post hoc tests revealing a consistent
pattern of the highest Depression rank showing a significantly
greater mean Absorption score when compared to those who are
either Never or Rarely depressed. The results of statistical
tests of the derived PCA components are also significant for
C2AO, C2AC and C3AC with a similar pattern in the post hoc
comparisons as found in the total scores. Here again, the
significant difference in the creation of absorptive Opportunity
is primarily located in the dimension of the intuitive/imaginal

<p><font color="#000000">Using a two-way design an attempt was
then made to ascertain whether there were any interaction effects
between the independent variables, Cannabis Use and
Self-Perceived Depression, in determining Absorption cell means.
Significant effects were found for three of the eight possible
variables: TAO (F(4,263) = 2.71, p = 0.0308); C1AO (F(4,263) =
2.42, p = 0.0493); and C3AC (F(4,263) = 2.68, p = 0.0320). As can
be seen in Figure 2, those who report never suffering from
depression and never using cannabis have, on average,
significantly lower mean TAO scores than either Past Users (p =
0.005) or Current Users (p = 0.002) who never report depression.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">For those who have never used cannabis
there is a steady and significant climb in average TAO score
across the depression ranks (p = 0.02, p = 0.02) finally
exceeding the average score for Past Users who are at the highest
level of depression (p &gt; 0.05). Current cannabis users show
only a very small and insignificant rise in mean TAO score across
depression ranks whereas Past Users show a non-significant drop
from the Never rank followed by a rise across the next rank.
Overall, those who have never used cannabis stand out in this
analysis in that increasing levels of self-perceived depression
show increasing mean opportunity made for absorptive activities
in contrast to current and past users who show consistently
higher mean levels of TAO across Depression ranks. Current Users
are over-all highest in TAO mean scores and vary very little no
matter what the rank of Self-Perceived Depression observed (p
&gt; 0.05). Therefore, it would appear that overall higher means
of TAO are connected to current cannabis use rather than
depression, except for non-users, who show increasing TAO which
is linearly related to frequency of self-reported depression.
Past Users fall somewhere between the other two user groups and
at the Rarely and More Often ranks of depression they are
significantly different than Current users (p = 0.03 and p =
0.005, respectively). <br>

Absorption Opportunity across levels of cannabis use and
self-perceived depression. <br>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">In Figure 3 the interaction plot for
C1AO ('Immersed entrancement.') reveals a similar pattern of
linear rise across the depression ranks for those who have never
used cannabis (p &gt; 0.05, p = 0.047). For Current Users C1AO
first makes a non-significant fall between the Never and Rarely
depression ranks with a final rise to a value slightly above the
initial C1AO level at the rank More Often. Past Users show a more
linear, but non-significant, decline in mean C1AO across
depression ranks with C1AO at the highest depression rank being
less than for either non-users or Current Users (p &gt; 0.05, p =
0.010, respectively). <br>

</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Finally, Figure 4 is the interaction
plot for the third significant variable, C3AC (Interoceptive
imaginal entrancement). As in the other cases above, the mean
values of C3AC for the sub-group of cannabis non-users rise
steeply in a somewhat linear fashion across the ranks of
Self-Perceived Depression (Never-Rarely, p &gt; 0.05; Rarely-More
Often, p = 0.001). The mean of C3AC for Current Users starts at a
higher value than the other user groups at depression rank Never
(p &gt; 0.05 for comparisons to both other groups) and rises
sharply, but levels out over the next rank. Comparisons of
Current User means at Rarely with Never Used means at the same
depression level also show significance (p = 0.033) and a
comparison of means for Current User-Rarely and Past User-Rarely
also reveals a strong difference (p = 0.0004).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The change in direction of the plot for
Current Users is opposite to that of the above variables and,
unlike the others, the mean value of C3AC at the highest
depression rank is lower than that for non-users (p &gt; 0.05).
However, the differences in the means across depression ranks for
Current Users are non-significant and represent, as in the other
two variables, the group showing the highest overall absorptive
activity. In contrast to the previous analyses, the Past User
group appears more variable with no significant difference
between the first two depression ranks but a significant rise
from the second to the third rank (p = 0.007).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Overall, it would appear that current
cannabis users show the highest overall mean Absorption levels no
matter how frequently they are subject to bouts of depression. On
the other hand, for non-users of cannabis, mean levels of
absorptive behaviors appear to increase in a linear manner with
increasing reported depression. The Absorption variables which
show this linear progression all appear to relate to 'immersion'
behavior with the variable, C3AC, representing specifically
interoceptively focused immersion. In general, it is in this case
that non-users show higher absorptive activity than either of the
other two user groups.<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">The operationalizing of Irwin's [21]
notions of 'capacity' and 'opportunity' as separately rated items
for frequency of occurrence and ease of participation
corresponding to each TAS item has yielded two useful Opportunity
dimensions in the former case and three useful Capacity
dimensions in the latter. This work thus confirms his initial
conjecture regarding the importance of looking beyond the raw TAS
score as the sole discriminative agent in studies employing Trait
Absorption as a predictive variable. In this study the calculated
component scores are capable of not only refining prediction by
providing useful measures of frequency and true capacity, but
they appear to yield finer discriminations through the use of the
sub-attributes capable of making more specific determinations
about the role of Absorption in behavior and cognition.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">For example, in this sample when
discriminating between the sexes, the TAS only provides a minimal
significant separation which gives no clue as to how men and
women differ in attentional behavior or style. The differences
found on the TAO and C2AO subscales provide a stronger
separation, however, indicating that women appear to make more
opportunities for these sorts of experiences and that the type of
experiences apparently sought are of an intuitive and imaginal
nature. Further, when combining the gender analysis with the rate
of cannabis use, this survey indicates that women have more
capacity for exteroceptive absorptive engagement with the
exception being current users of cannabis where men and women are
statistically indistinguishable. To a degree, through the use of
Absorption as a predictor, this analysis confirms a stereotype of
women as being more interpersonally engaged, by the fact that
they demonstrate more frequent intuitive behavior which tends to
be focused outwardly.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Of course, in the case of cannabis use
alone the TAS, TAO and TAC scores are all strong discriminators
of cannabis users from lower scoring past and non-users. In this
situation both components of the Opportunity PCA show the same
pattern of significant difference as for the total scores but
with the intuitive/imaginal dimension being a somewhat stronger
discriminator. This difference may indicate that, although making
opportunities for interoceptive and exteroceptive deployment of
absorbed attention is a significant aspect of being a cannabis
user, the seeking of intuitive ways of knowing may be an even
more important motivator for cannabis users to make opportunities
for absorption. On the other hand, when examining participants'
capacity for Absorption, only C1AC and C3AC are useful
discriminators of cannabis use, thus the difference in capacity
for absorption appears to be mainly in the ability to deploy
attention inwardly or outwardly in a highly immersed manner.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">The positive connection between
increased TAS, TAO and TAC to higher levels of self-perceived
motivation loss may be understood as either being caused by the
effect of cannabis on motivation or as a by-product of the
preference for the more passive behavior which obviously would be
a consequence of being in an absorptive state. When the results
of examining the component scores are added to the analysis,
there appears to be a related, albeit less strong, relationship
between motivation and absorption similar to the cannabis use
pattern with the exception that exteroceptive immersion does not
reach a significant difference. Recalling that there is a
definite dependency relationship between cannabis use and
motivation loss, it is difficult to disconfound the effect seen
here from that for cannabis. It is thus difficult to interpret
the meaning of these results without a more rigorous experimental
design in which cannabis use and motivation loss can be
disentangled. However, it is also noteworthy that post hoc tests
reveal that the primary effect for motivation loss is to be found
between the More Often and Rarely levels which may be indicative
of different underlying causes and/or personality types involved.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The strong, positive relationship of
increasing absorption activity, as reflected in the three total
scores, to increasing levels of self-perceived depression cannot,
as in the case of motivation, be understood as merely a secondary
result of a dependency between cannabis use and depression.
Although there may be some overlapping variance between these two
factors, as witnessed by similarities in Opportunity and Capacity
found regarding absorption in cannabis use, component score means
in this instance show significantly greater capacity for
intuitive knowing for those reporting more instances of
depression. Thus, it would seem that a primary observable
difference amongst groups of differing levels of depression is
their differing capacity to enter into intuitive and imaginal
experiences.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The interaction between depression and
cannabis use for Absorption highlights further the real
differences in absorptive frequency and capacity across these two
factors. Overall, current users of cannabis have more capacity
and make more opportunities to engage the world in an absorptive
way with the level of depression apparently being irrelevant.
Past cannabis users show a slightly more varied but related
pattern, but non-users of cannabis reveal a strong positive
relationship between self-reported depression and the rate of
making opportunities and having capacity for absorptive
experience. The latter situation makes more sense when we
consider that, in addition to this pattern existing for total
opportunity, the intero-, exteroceptive opportunity and the
interoceptive capacity components show a similar progression
which can be interpreted as increasing depression leading to
increasing time spent introspectively inward dwelling. Or,
conversely, those who have a higher innate capacity for
interoceptive immersion may make more opportunities for deploying
attention inwardly which may become part of the mechanism in the
etiology of increasing bouts of depression.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Although the data suggest that there is
no dependency relationship between depression and cannabis use,
increasing use of cannabis is strongly associated with decreasing
motivation. Again, it is not possible to surmise from this
exploratory model what, if any, is the causal connection.
However, it can be hypothesized that increasing motivation loss
due to increasing use of cannabis may lead to a decrease in
external physical participation with an attendant increasing role
as 'observer'. For those high in overall absorption this may be
self-rewarding, thus leading to a life style where total
deployment of attentional resources, externally or internally,
becomes one of the primary activities of 'participation' in the
life process. Furthermore, part of the enjoyment of this role of
'absorbed observer' may come from the increasing frequency of
imaginal and intuitive experiences which appear to accompany
external and/or internal attentional immersion. In the case of
past users of cannabis, however, the general levels of absorption
are somewhat less and, as a result, the associated life-style and
activities may not have provided enough reward to overcome the
negative reinforcement of whatever was perceived to be lost
through the use of cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">On the other hand, greater capacity for
interoceptive deployment of attention may be connected to
increasing depression for cannabis users and non-users alike, if,
as suggested, inward dwelling is part of the etiology of
depression.. Although no significant difference was found on this
capacity component for cannabis users, the plot of Figure 4
reveals a jump in this capacity for users from those who never
have depression to those who do. However, it would require
carefully controlled experimental studies to disentangle the
causal web underlying Absorption, cannabis and depression.</font>
