Most companies avoid writing a business plan until they are in dire need of money. Propelled forward by the need to finance business growth, the technology entrepreneur begins this unique form of communication with the intent of convincing potential investors that they can make a good return on their investment (ROI) if they finance their firm. When developed for this purpose, the business plan has an external focus and must thoroughly address issues of importance to private investors. More experienced entrepreneurs also recognize that a business plan has great internal value, serving as a guide to help the company chart a course towards successful Phase III commercialization. 'Commercialization' as used here refers to (a) the sale of product or technology to private sector or military customers, and/or (b) the investment of developmental funds by the private sector in the company or a specific technology.<P>

Irrespective of the reasons for writing a business plan, the time invested can be far more fruitful if the entrepreneur views business planning as a transformational process for his or her management team. In making this statement, it is recognized that often the management team may consist of one person - the founder/technology entrepreneur. The end product of well-conceived planning is not only an excellent selling document, but increased business acumen which enables the technology entrepreneur to effectively use this tool to raise capital.<P>

The purpose of this chapter is to (1) describe the requirements of the audience for a company's business plan (i.e. potential investors), (2) provide a generic business plan outline, (3) examine methods for conducting the research required for business plan development, and (4) provide suggestions for appropriate use of business plans in seeking external funds. If you do not require external financing, your company in essence is the investor in itself. You should proceed to develop a business plan in the identical fashion suggested and then step back to examine the business opportunity from an investor's perspective. This vantage point will assist you in determining if you have charted the appropriate course of action.<P>

<H4><!-- Anchor Point Tag -->
<A NAME="audience">B.	Know your Audience</A></H4>

Your business plan is a communication tool. Therefore, in order to develop an effective selling document, the technology entrepreneur must first begin with a solid understanding of the audience. The audience for a business plan is not the same as the audience for a grant proposal. When you develop a Phase I or Phase II SBIR proposal, your task is to communicate effectively with other technologists. You, therefore, emphasize the significance of the problem, your methods for solving the problem, your qualifications, and the innovativeness/originality of the proposed work. However, as you enter Phase III and seek private sector investment, the technology entrepreneur communicates with a different group - with investors whose mission is to create value.<P>

Understanding the investor's perspective is often difficult for scientists. Scientists and investors move in different circles - circles that rarely intersect except when the agenda is money. It's money that brings scientists and investors together. Investors wish to create wealth and need a vehicle for doing so. Scientists seek financial resources to continue nurturing their dream. In essence, the investor sees money as the end and the scientists sees money as the means. What unlikely bedfellows!<P>

Investors carry the weight of fiduciary responsibility and manage other people's money. Creativity in the realm of finance can result in a prison sentence and heavy fines. Thus, individuals trained in finance are taught many procedures to appropriately track the movement of money and to predict investments which will result in the creation of additional wealth for their clients. The phrase that most befits investors is "I'm from Missouri, Prove it to me!" Give me data. Give me procedures. Minimize my risk.<P>

In the relationship between investors and scientists, scientists are the suitors. This is an unfamiliar position for new technology entrepreneurs. It is important to keep in mind that when seeking private sector financing, the technology entrepreneur is asking the investor to part with that which is at the core of their professional life - financial resources. The technology entrepreneur must therefore act as a visitor in the investor's world and learn to speak the language of business. The entrepreneur must de-emphasize discussions of technology and instead emphasize information regarding customers, markets, distribution channels, intellectual property, sales plans, engineering and manufacturing plans, human resource and financial requirements. These are the parameters that determine if your business opportunity will create value for potential investors. These are the variables of greatest interest to your audience - the investor.<P>

<A NAME="obstacles">C.	Obstacles to Business Planning</A></H4>

Without a doubt, good business planning takes time! Unfortunately, many technology entrepreneurs begin the business planning process too late - waiting until they are in urgent need of financial resources before they begin. Due to lack of time and lack of familiarity with the process, they approach business planning at a superficial level - quickly finding answers to generic questions that must be addressed in business planning. However, good planning cannot be approached superficially. A rushed attempt at business planning will often fail in obtaining the desired funds. As a result, the new technology entrepreneur might falsely conclude that business concepts are unimportant, simple, and little more than conjecture - thus, distancing himself further from the benefits of good business planning.<P>

Another obstacle that prevents technology entrepreneurs from developing a business plan is the belief that they already have one. It's the plan in the entrepreneur's head. The entrepreneur believes that he has all the pertinent information. He simply hasn't had time to write it down yet. However, what the entrepreneur believes to be a business plan is nothing more than a "Mind Map", or a set of untested hypotheses and assumptions about the business environment in which the entrepreneur operates. This is the Pre-condition in Figure 1. The Mind Map is expressed simply, it also lacks depth of understanding. Just as it is insufficient for a scientist to base predictions strictly on hypotheses and assumptions, it is equally inappropriate for entrepreneurs to base their decisions on untested hypotheses. In business, as in science, conjecture must gradually be replaced by certitude!<P>

<A NAME="theory">D.	Business Planning as Theory Construction</A></H4>

In the practice of science, a scientist strives to observe, explain, predict, and control the phenomenon of interest. A technology entrepreneur must aspire to no less in the business planning process. The scientist, as business planner, must observe the world in which the business opportunity exists. The most important variables to which he or she must attend are the customers, competitors, market size, financial resources, risks, human resources, and technology/product. (Technology is listed last intentionally, as the potential investor usually assumes the viability of the technology at the outset and validates this later.)<P>

The entrepreneur must gather sufficient information to explain the behavior of these variables so that adequate predictions can be made regarding their probable interaction. Strategies then need to be developed to maximize the likelihood that the course of development can be controlled in the desired fashion - which is, in the creation of a commercially viable business. Business planning then is like "theory construction" or "model building." <P>

At the outset, a scientist's view of his business contains numerous assumptions and hypotheses. However, through the application of a systematic approach these assumptions may be tested and even discarded if necessary. A business plan is nothing more than the business counterpart of scientific theory and embodies the scientist's understanding of the business world in which the technology exists and can be commercialized.<P>

<H4><!-- Anchor Point Tag -->
<A NAME="Process">E.	Business Planning - the Process</A></H4>

The most important aspect of business planning is the process itself. This process contains a number of discrete steps:<P>

clarification of the company vision and mission,
information gathering (customers, market, competitors, distribution channels, costs associated with R&D, engineering, manufacturing and financing options),	
review of information - synthesis, inferences and deductions,
decision making
re-evaluation of mind map,
number crunching
strategizing, and
writing<P>

The business planning process is iterative and not linear in nature. As the entrepreneur gathers more information, the vantage point and positions taken will shift. During this process, the technology entrepreneur must be willing to part with perspectives that upon examination fail to coincide with the evidence at hand. In most cases, the outcome of good strategic business planning is change... a modification in the technology, the product, the team, the direction, or the assessment of the opportunity itself. This is where the transformational value of business planning becomes evident.<P>

Business planning is always added to a very busy schedule and, therefore, requires a firm commitment at the outset. It is recommended that the technology entrepreneur anticipate that approximately 300 person-hours will be required for the business planning process over a three month period. Once the entrepreneur has made a commitment to proceed, a project manager should be selected and a schedule established for completion of the process.<P>

The project manager should either be the company President or someone else within the management team. It is important that the technology entrepreneur include other people from the management team in this process. This will assure that their perspectives also shift in light of new data gleaned as the work progresses. Tasks such as secondary data gathering, number crunching, and editing can be undertaken by others on behalf of the team. Thus, by outsourcing some tasks, the management team can reduce demands on its time.<P>

Don't overlook the services of the NASA Regional Technology Transfer Centers, graduate students, and accountants with regard to these activities. However, all other tasks should be undertaken by the management team. The technology entrepreneur's team will miss the opportunity for growth if data synthesis, decision-making, and strategizing are allocated to others. This will compromise the ability of the team to interface effectively with potential investors. This business plan must be yours! Ownership must be felt by the team!<P>

<A NAME="outline">F.	Generic Business Plan Outline</A></H4>

When you actually begin to write the business plan, you should expect that the process will be similar to writing a technical paper. First a draft is produced (referred to in Figure 1 as the Business/Operational Plan) and then a briefer, more polished final draft will follow (Business Plan). The latter is what you will share with potential investors. As this is a different style of writing, expect that the actual preparation of the business plan will take more time than that required to write a technical paper.<P>

The overall objective of a business plan is to present a compelling argument for investment. The document begins with a presentation of background information regarding the company, the technology, the industry, the market, the competitors and then concludes with the presentation of a detailed plan for capturing a piece of that market and creating value for both the investor and the firm. The information presented in the plan is clustered into various sections, all of which are fairly generic (See Table 1). Don't get hung up on the actual Chapter headings used in the table of contents. These may vary somewhat from one outline to another. The variation is irrelevant. What is important is the level of detail and specificity.<P>

Specificity is what differentiates excellent from poor business plans. Again, remember that your audience consists of risk averse investors who wish to create value. They are not enamored with technology, but with the possibility that your technology presents for developing wealth. The more facts that you can provide, the better. <P>

Fill your business plan with certitude! Reduce conjecture! When developing models for emerging markets, base the model on a number of well established data points and benchmarks. Cite your sources, just as you do when preparing a technical paper. Define your market segments with specificity, rather than presenting data at the industry level. For example, if you have produced a high-efficiency heater that could be used in the high-end market - size that niche, rather than representing your market as the total HVAC market.<P>

<A NAME="formatting">G.	Formatting your Business Plan</A></H4>

Potential investors are presented with thousands of business plans each year. They quickly scan the Executive Summary, look at the financials and then decide if they will read any further. Your Executive Summary is, therefore, very important. It must sizzle! Don't write it when you are tired - it needs to be exciting for an investor. Don't make it sound academic - brag a bit! Talk about your accomplishments - specifically those that have relevance for value creation. Don't make it sound as if your focus is merely to obtain funds for R&D. Talk about and represent a genuine desire for a partnership with the investor. Make it apparent that there will be an opportunity for significant return on investment. However, do not spell out the terms of a potential agreement as this needs to be negotiated. Be brief - but not so short that the excitement is lost. <P>

The visual appearance of a business plan is quite different than that of a grant proposal. Your objective when formatting the business plan is to make it distinctive. You want to make it stand out from the rest. It should be accessible and easy to read. This is done via the use of graphics, color, spacing, and type font. I am not suggesting that form is more important than content. Good content must be there - but then, go that extra mile. In the business world, a book is judged by its cover. Appearance is taken as a reflection of the professionalism of your firm.<P>

There are common errors made in formatting business plans which are deadly. Before you present a copy of your business plan to an investor, check it thoroughly. Make sure that:<P>

<A NAME="using">H.	Using your Business Plan</A></H4><P>

An excellent business plan contains detailed, proprietary information about your firm's strategy for developing a place in the market. This is not the kind of information that you will want anyone, but a serious investor to have. Therefore, be cautious in the distribution of your business plan and pre qualify potential investors before providing them with a copy to review.<P>

How do you meet investors? The most common way to meet investors is through third party introductions. A lawyer, an accountant, another technologist, a consultant, or a friend may make the introduction for you. After the introduction, call to set up an appointment to meet with the potential investor.<P>

At a meeting, present salient information regarding your business opportunity to the potential investor. Always bear in mind the motivation of the investor and address business issues rather than focusing on the technology. This first meeting should be on a non-confidential basis. Spend time during this meeting getting to know each other. Ask questions to determine if the potential investor is a good match for you. Typical questions include: What kind of experience have they had with helping companies at this stage of development? What is the typical return on investment that they look for? What is their experience in this industry or marketplace? Do they have established relationships with company X, Y, Z - potential good strategic partners for you? Are they currently investing in a competitor? In this meeting it is important to get a feeling for the person with whom you are dealing. Develop an understanding of how they work and what else the investor brings to the table besides money. Ultimately, any potential business relationship depends on trust. This is what each of you must assess during your first meeting. In closing, leave a copy of your Executive Summary with the potential investor and establish a time and a reason for the next interaction. Always keep in mind that you are the suitor in this relationship and be sure to initiate the scheduled follow-up activities.<P>

If you decide to proceed, the next typical step is to ask the potential investor to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. Some investors will sign a Confidentiality Agreement, others will not. Therefore, at this point the technology entrepreneur must make a decision as to whether he wishes to share the business plan with a potential investor on a non-confidential basis. When confronted with this situation, some entrepreneurs decide to remove sections of the plan that they consider particularly sensitive and share an edited version on a non-confidential basis. However, it is preferable for
