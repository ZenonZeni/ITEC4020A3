</p>

<p>Well, sir,&quot; said Mr. Dooley, &quot; I see that the
prohy­bitionists are gettin' a sthrangle hold on me old friend
an' bosom companion, King Alcohol, now more gin'rally known as
th' Demon Rum. An' where d'ye think they 're sthrongest? Ye'll
niver believe it, but it's down South. Yes, sir, in th' sunny
Southland, that I wanst thought was sunny partly because iv th'
efforts iv Nature an' partly because iv th' effects iv booze,
'tis as hard to get a dhrink now as it wanst was not to get wan. </p>

<p><img src="NEW-SOU.JPG" width="183" height="263"> </p>

<p>&quot;All me idees are upset. I've always wanted to go down
South some day an' loaf in that beauchous land, among th' palm
an' palmettoes, th' turpentine trees, th' sweet potatoes, an' th'
yellow janders, consumin' th' flagrant mint julep an' watchin'
th' happy darky pluckin' th' cotton fr'm th' vine be day an' be
night out undher th' moonlight playin' his banjo or racin' with
th' bloodhounds. Me idee iv hospitality was Southren hospitality,
an' me idee iv Southren hospitality was that a Southrengintleman
met ye at th' thrain with a noggm' iv dhrink in th' crook iv his
thumb an' if ye didn't dhrink he shot ye.<br>
<img src="SODA.JPG" width="179" height="228"> </p>

<p align="center"><i>The New Kentucky Hospitality<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;But I was all wrong, d'ye mind. Th' South that used to
be thirsty has gone dhry. Now, whin aKentucky gintleman meets ye
at th' thrain, if ye're a dhrinkin' man 'tis not to his home he
invites ye, but to th' town jail. He no longer allures ye with
th' cup that cheers an' inebyrates ye to­night an' biteth like
an asp an' stingeth like an adder to­morrah mornin'. No, sir.
Th' best ye can get in public is a small pan iv Jamaica ginger or
exthract iv vanilla in th' corner dhrug store. In th' hospitable
mansions iv th' South, with their wide porticos, their lofty
pillars an' their overhanging eaves an' morgedges, where wanst
th' tired traveller heard on approachin' a sound like th' ringin'
of sleigh bells, which showed that th' colonel had seen him
comin' an' was hurlin' together a whisky punch, he can on'y get a
dhrink be crawlin' behind th' colonel down into th' coal cellar,
while Ephraim, th' old fam'ly servant that was employed last week
at th' slave market or imployment agency, watches f'r th' polis.
An' poor Sambo or Epaminondas Beecher Roosevelt, as th' case may
be, no longer sings th' sintimintal plantation ballad iv 'Give me
me gin,' but 'Away away th' bowl . '<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>King Alcohol and His Subjects<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Old King Alcohol is dethroned down South. He ain't put
out altogether, mind ye. He's like th' Jook iv Orleens in Paris.
Some iv th' old fam'lies receive him quietly in their homes an'
bow lower to him than they iver did whin he was on th' throne.
But he's lost most iv his authorities. Thousands that wanst fell
on their noses befure him now refuse to recognize him in public.
Whin he goes amongst th' popylace, he goes, as Hogan says,
incognito, disguised as a cure f'r fever an' ague, an' those that
know who he is on'y give a wink. He's not supposed to be there,
but 'twud be too much throuble to fire him out entirely, so he's
allowed to hang around, payin' no taxes an' supported be a few
faithful adherents. </p>

<p>&quot;'Tis th' same with him as with King Looey. Says wan man:
' I don't care how much King Looey or King Alcohol hurts ye, he
's good f'r me. Hooray f'r King Loocahol.' Says another: 'I don't
care how good he is f'r ye, he's bad f'r me. Death to th' King.'
And th' end iv it is that he's deprived iv his throne but niver
has his head cut off; he sneaks around an' does th' best he can,
an' is loved be those that he 's been useful to, an' hated be
those that can get along better without him, an' 1oved wan time
an' hated anothor be those he harms most.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="INCOG.JPG" width="180" height="197"> </p>

<p>A man that looks on a king as a roofover his head an' a flure
undher his feet will always be in favor iv kings. King Alcohol
an' King Edward make sorr.e people better thin their neighbors.
They are both stimulating to Rothschild. A little alcohol an' a
little Edward keep him goin'. Thin come a lot iv people that King
Edward or King Alcohol do nawthin' at all f'r, an' whin they find
it out they want to abolish him. An' afther thim are a great
throng that are pizened be anny kind iv a king an' they can't get
away fr'm him. At night they're wild with lilety that makes thim
think they're betther thin they iver thought they were. Th' king
has admitted thim to a private aujience an' has let thim tell
what they think about thimsilves. ' Rise, Sl William Hoskins,'
says he, 'if ye can,' ht says, an' he hits thim over th' back iv
th' head with a soord or a bottle. An' th' next mornin' whin they
do arise th' title has disappeared an' all they have left to
remindthim iv it is th' pain in th' back iv th' head where th'
knighting was done. </p>

<p>&quot;It's cured me iv me desire to go down South.
Hincefoorth, Hinnissy, I will spend me winters in' th' North, as
usual. Not that I need dhrink mesilf as a part iv hospitality. I
can dhrink an' I can let it aloneat different times. But many
people think that th' on'y diff'rence between hospitality an'
passin' a cold potato out iv th' back dure is a dhrink. F'r
mesilf I am more happy settin' down to an innocent meal with
nawthin' but water than I wud be at a table with lashings iv
dhrink-not that night, but th' day afther. I won't go South, not
because I will suffer mesilf, but I don't want to see th'
sufferings iv others. </p>

<p><img src="KNIGHTED.JPG" width="189" height="200"> </p>

<p>&quot;Th' victim iv th' dhrink habit whin he can't get a
dhrink is a dhreadful sight to me. Ye go down South expictin' to
see th' colonel an' hear him warm up over a mint julep an' tell
ye about th' battle iv Shiloh, which he fought so bravely thin
but more bravely iver since. Ye go up to th' old house on th'
plantation; ye notice an air iv desolation about th' place. There
are weeds m th' mint bed. Th' colonel leads ye into th' house an'
calls to th' faithful old retainer: 'Rastus, ye black rascal,
bring Colonel Hinnissy a glass an' trot out th' decanter iv
Munson's Cure f'r Epilepsy. Don't be afraid, Colonel. There isn't
a barrel iv headache in a dhrop iv it. Look at it. See how th'
sun shines through th' high wines, see th' beads iv fusel oil
glistening like amethysts, notice how the crystal morphine clings
to th' sides iv th' glass. Ye won't get anny such stuff as that
in th' North. I get it especially fr'm th' distiller in
Indianapolis, Injyanny. Here's ye 'r health, Colonel. Rastus,
stand by with th' fire hose to put th' Colonel out.' I </p>

<p>don't want to be a victim iv anny kind iv dhrink, but th' wan
kind I'm partic'l'ry afraid iv dyin' iv, is th' kind that is sold
in prohybition states. I wanst knew a man that had lived f'r
twinty years in Ioway an' escaped arrest undher th' Supreme Court
decision that he was entitled to an original package. Th'
packages that he got were th' most original I iver heerd iv. Whin
he come back to Chicago he cudden't find a cocktail that suited
him outside iv a dhrug store. Whin I made wan f'r him he asked me
if I hadn't left out th' rough on rats.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>A Colonel's Untiimely End<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir, it's goin' to wurruk a gr­reat change in th'
South. I expect to read that some frind iv mine in that impeeryal
domain, afther a jovyal meeting in a paint store, where he an'
his companyons imbibed . modhrately iv a can iv gasolene, engaged
in his civic duty as a member iv a vigilance comity, an'
approachin' too near th' fire, passed away beloved be all. Har'ly
a fam'ly in th' neighborhood but what has lost a member through
th' colonel's untimely departure. </p>

<p><img src="HOSKINS.JPG" width="180" height="252"> </p>

<p>&quot;Why, innissy, I read th' other day iv a most unfortunate
occurrence down in Texas. A perfectly respectable an' innocent
man, of good connections, while attemptin' to dhraw a revolver to
plug an inimy was hastily shot down be th' rangers, who thought
he was pullin' a pocket flask. Is no man's life safe against th'
acts iv irresponsible officers iv th' law ? </p>

<p align="center"><i>The Ominous Size of Wave<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;An' I tell ye something, Hinnissy, it ain't goin' to be
very long before this here wave iv prohybition comes up here an'
deluges ye an' me. Anny day ye may look to see boots an' shoes,
or more prob'bly books, in th' window where ye now see th'
stately rows iv bottles that ye think are filled with tempting
dhrink but raaly have nawthin' in thim but th' wather I filled
thim with th' year afther th' big fire. I'm a merchant, I am, an
I'll sell something. I was cut out be nature to sell people
things that they first took because they made thim feel supeeryor
to other people an' that later became a necessity to thim. Whin I
bought this thing I vear in me shirt front, that no jooler or
other robber wud take f'r a dimon pin, I got it because it raised
me up a notch above me fellow men. But afther wearin' it a little
while I cud no more do without it thin without me undhershirt,
that no wan iver sees onless they peek up me arm. So it is with
nearly all th' things that people buy, fr'm neckties to
autymobills, includin' dhrink. If I can't sell booze I'll sell
false hair, I'll sell cuff­buttons, I'll sell hair ile, I'll
sell patent­leather shoes, I'll sell pianos. I'll sell joolry,
I'll sell brown­stone houses, fast horses, or nommynations to
office. I deal in pride. I will sell annything except th'
necessities iv life. If I own anny iv thim I'll put thim in a
basket on th' counter an' say: </p>

<p>'Take wan.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>A Secret of theTrade<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Do I think 'twill come? Faith, I wudden't wondher. I see
what Hogan calls portints iv th' times. Th' day was whin ivry wan
that wanted a pollytickal job asked th' privilege iv hangin' a
litthygraft iv himsilf in me window. I let thim do it because it
hurt thim with many iv me customers, who said: ' I'll niver vote
f'r that robber.' But, nowadays, be Hivens, no wan wants his
pitcher hung in a saloon. They're thryin' to get thim pasted up
in th' churches. They're gettin' on to us. I'll tell ye a secret
iv th' thrade. I'd rather have th' Father Macchew Society behind
me thin th' entire saloon vote. </p>

<p><img src="COURT.JPG" width="202" height="258"><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>What Drink Does for a Man<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;I wudden't mind if prohybition did b r e a k through. In
his heart th' thruest prohybitionist is a saloonkeeper. B e t t h
e r t h i n annywan else he k n o w s t h a t what's his meat is
everybody else's pizen. Havin' l o n g assocyated with th'
dhrinkin' classes, I think less iv thim more an' more ivry year.
Th' dhrink makes thim too fond iv thimsilves. As me frind
Mulrooney th' printer says, th' dhrink knocks th' dot off their
little i an' they think they're upper case. A man comes in here
whin I'm about ready to pull down th' blinds, leans on th'
cheese, an' sings: 'My bonnie lies over th' ocean,' thin says: '
What's that ? ' whin I suggist that he go home, an' fin'lly ends
up be weeping over his throubles. I know what's th' matter with
him. He's thinkin' about himself too much. I know that his voice
sounds like suds escapin' fr'm th' kitchen sink, an' I can lick
him in a minyit with an' ice­pick, an' I am laughin' mesilf sick
over his fam'ly throubles, but he doesn't think so. Divvle th'
bit. He's got himsilf painted like a combynation iv Melba,
Jeffreys an' th'Two Orphans, an' annybody that don t believe he's
right is lookin' f'r throuble. Faith, if anny prohybitionist
thinks 'tis pleasant presidin' over this here Palace iv Rum he's
welcome to th' job. If I was an insanity expert, instead iv bein'
on th' level as I am, I'd commit half me patients to an asylum.
&quot; </p>

<p><img src="KINGACL2.JPG" width="378" height="219"> </p>

<p>&quot;But can ye iver enforce prohybition?&quot; asked Mr.
Hennessy.&quot; </p>

<p>Well,&quot; said Mr. Dooley, &quot; Father Kelly says th' best
they've done so far is to make dhrink wrong to take, hard to get,
an' turr'ble bad whin ye get it.&quot;<br>

<p align="center">THE CRY OF THE WOMAN </p>

<p align="center">BY ELIZABETH GRAEME BARBOUR<br>
</p>

<p>Man's work is mine, tho' woman born; <br>
My hurried way in crowded mart <br>
Is trod unswervingly each morn; <br>
I live a thing apart, <br>
I bear a hungry heart.<br>
</p>

<p>Man's love and babe's, <br>
life hath denied; <br>
No leisure e'en to give a crust <br>
Is mine, swept onward with the tide <br>
Of those enslaved by lust <br>
Of gold, or load unjust. <br>
</p>

<p>I would not vie with men for gain, <br>
Nor in the sun of ease would bask; </p>

<p>I--who man's burden bear with pain-- <br>
I want my woman's task. <br>
Give this, O Lord, I ask!</p>
