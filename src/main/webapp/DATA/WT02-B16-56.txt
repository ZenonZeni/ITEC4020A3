<i>Clean Cities </i>is a program designed to help local businesses and communities voluntarily 
comply with environmental regulations and create jobs by expanding the use of alternative 
fuel vehicles (AFVs) in urban communities. As a nation we continue to consume more than 
60% of the oil used in this country for transportation. <i>Clean Cities </i>helps to reduce our 
nation's dependence on foreign oil as well as reduce air pollution caused by 
gasoline-powered vehicles. Since the program began in September of 1993, thirty-four 
localities have received DOE's <i>Clean Cities </i>designation, including Greater Boston and 
four Connecticut cities (Norwalk, Waterbury, Norwich and New London). By the end of 
1996, the thirty-four cities combined intend to have more than 60,000 AFV's in use and 
plan to establish up to 700 refueling and maintenance facilities.<br>

<i>The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) </i>reduces the cost of government 
through energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, and water conservation. FEMP helps 
federal energy managers identify and procure the best energy-saving projects through 
pro-active problem solving; an aggressive emphasis on increasing the number and quality 
of projects; and effective partnerships among agencies, utilities, the private sector and 
states. As the lead organization implementing legislation and Presidential direction, FEMP 
administers an interagency energy committee and task force. FEMP works in four major 
areas: </p>

<li><b>project financing </b>- energy savings performance contracting, Federal Energy 
Efficiency Fund, and utility incentives; </li>
<li><b>technical guidance and assistance; </b></li>

The U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have 
joined forces to sponsor an innovative, cost-sharing grant program with state and industry 
partners to save energy, prevent pollution and enhance industrial competitiveness. The 
NICE3 program focuses on providing financial assistance to those partnerships that 
develop industrial process modifications that will reduce energy consumption, promote 
innovative waste minimization techniques and enhance industrial competitiveness through 
the introduction and dissemination of cost effective waste minimization and energy efficient 
processes, equipment and practices. Matching grants, not to exceed $425,000 in federal 
financial assistance, are provided to assist in the development of those projects.<br>

<p><b>Motor Challenge Program:</b><br>
The Motor Challenge Program is an initiative to improve the competitiveness of U.S. 
industry by encouraging the use of energy efficient motor/drive systems. Under the 
initiative, DOE provides reliable and timely data on motor/drive systems through an 
information clearinghouse. Showcase demonstrations, partnerships, outreach/marketing and 
development of a national database are also elements of the program. The NRO works 
closely with state governments to promote the program in New England industries.<br>

<p><b>Climate Challenge:</b><br>
Climate Challenge Program is a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy and the 
electric utility industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program consists of 
voluntary commitments by individual electric utilities to undertake actions to reduce, avoid 
or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. DOE has published the Climate Challenge Options 
Workbook which describes over fifty options that utilities can use to meet their 
commitments. (DOE has also developed forms for voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas 
emission reductions.) The NRO facilitates project and technical assistance, tracks program 
progress and provides public recognition to utility participants.<br>

Under this program, the NRO provides technical assistance and materials to promote 
the implementation of model Energy Codes and Standards by the New England states in 
both the residential and commercial building sectors. The Pacific Northwest Lab (PNL) 
and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers 
(ASHRAE) collaborate on the program. Assistance is tailored to individual State 
needs.<br>

<p><b>Rebuild America:</b><br>
In partnership with state and local governments and energy offices, the NRO is forming 
public/private partnerships that accelerate energy efficiency improvements to existing 
commercial and multi-family buildings. Numerous benefits arise from revitalizing 
buildings including lower operating expenses for building owners, lower energy costs for 
tenants, job creation, and increased worker comfort and productivity. A significant 
secondary benefit of the energy efficiency realized by these projects is improved air 
quality for all New Englanders, i.e., less energy consumption translates into less NOX, 
SOX and CO2 in our air.<br>

The State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) is a statutory formula-grant program. 
States submit annual plans for funding. There are several mandated measures that each plan 
must address, but once the minimum requirements are met, a state may then request funds 
for almost any energy efficiency program which best meets its citizens' needs. Mandated 
measures include: building standards, procurement, transportation, emergency planning and 
activity coordination. Optional measures can range from photovoltaic array projects to 
carpools. The SECP has provided each state with funds to design energy efficiency and 
renewable energy programs to meet individual state energy needs.<br>

The U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) provides 
weatherization services to low-income clients by improving the energy conservation of 
their homes while ensuring their health and safety. The Weatherization Program is 
delivered nationwide by a large organization of state agencies, Native American Tribal 
Organizations and over 1,100 local agencies. Using advanced diagnostics and 
weatherization technology, the Weatherization network installs cost-effective energy 
conservation measures in over 200,000 low-income dwellings a year. The NRO 
administers the Weatherization Program in New England and continuously strives to 
improve the quality and effectiveness of services provided to clients through on-going 
technical training of state and local agency staff.<br>

Funded by DOE, the New England Governor's Conference, Inc. (NEGC) Regional 
Energy Planning Project is an on-going regional planning effort in the six New England 
states. The goal of the project is to provide the New England states with a comprehensive 
and balanced assessment of New England's energy situation. The project is providing each 
state with modeling capability, database development, policy analysis, and the 
incorporation of the views of appropriate related sectors in the region. Phase I was 
completed in 1992. Phase II is expected to be completed in September, 1995.<br>

of our grantees include the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, the National Association 
of State Utility Consumer Advocates, the Regulatory Assistance Project, the Biomass 
Energy Alliance, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Solar Energy Industries 
Association. Internationally, the NRO manages grants in support of photovoltaics and other

Energy Efficiency (CEE) to promote the commercialization of technologies at increasing 
levels of efficiency. Among the many initiatives being pursued are high efficiency 
commercial air conditioning, residential clothes washers and air conditioning, geothermal 
heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and compact fluorescent fixtures. The CEE works 
closely with its electric and gas utility members' demand-side management programs as 
well as manufacturers to promote these initiatives.<br>
