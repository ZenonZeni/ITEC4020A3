AMERICA ONLINE ACQUIRES IMAGINATION NETWORK; TWO DOZEN LAYOFFS
EXPECTED

     America Online Inc. [AMER] has acquired The ImagiNation Network
Inc. (INN), an online game provider, from AT&T [T].  The deal was
valued at more than $10 million, a source told MMWire.  As a
wholly-owned subsidary of AOL, INN will become a primary partner in
AOL's Games Channel, and is expected to strike deals with Internet
Service Providers as well as AOL's competitors, said Tom Monagan, AOL
spokesman.  INN's senior management team will remain intact, but the
company will lay off 24 employees, said INN spokeswoman Cindy Wilson. 
The game company has "critical experience" developing multiplayer
online games and the ability to "build community in the way we like,"
said Lawrence Schick, g.m. of games for AOL. INN will begin offering
games on AOL in the fall, and later this year will launch CyberPark, a
3-D environment in which gamers take on customized
characters--"avatars"--to play the games. (America Online, Ted
Leonsis, president, 703/448-8700)

$8.5+ MILLION CAMPAIGN FOR SEGA'S NiGHTS: CAN IT COMPETE WITH NINTENDO
64 DEBUT?

     In an apparent bid to upstage the much-anticipated debut next
month of the Nintendo 64 and its Super Mario 64 title, Sega of America
is launching an $8.5 million marketing campaign to promote its Sega
Saturn title, NiGHTS. ($49.99).  The title--which will debut on August
20--will come less than six weeks before Nintendo's debut on Sept. 30. 
"There's no question [Nintendo 64] will be a dominant voice in the
holiday period," Anne Moellering, Sega of America's marketing manager,
told MMWIRE.  "We're clearly aware of that," Moellering added.  About
80 percent of Sega's marketing budget will be devoted to TV
advertisements for NiGHTS on ABC, NBC, and other channels.  Moellering
added that it was a "coincidence" that Sega was debuting NiGHTS so
close to the Nintendo 64's debut.  Sales of the Nintendo 64 in Japan
have exceeded expectations thus far, and most analysts predict that
the 500,000 units Nintendo expects to ship in the United States this
year will sell out.  Nintendo reportedly is spending $50 million to
market the Nintendo 64 and its acclaimed Super Mario title.  Sega also
will sell a NiGHTS bundle pack ($69.99), which includes the title and
a 3D controller pad; and the 3D-controller pad ($39.99).  Sega's other
marketing efforts will include print advertisements, tie-ins with the
Six Flags resort, and in-store standup demonstration units.  (Sega of
America, Anne Moellering, marketing manager, 415/802-3280)

swap valued at $2 million. TView is a developer of PC-to-TV multimedia
products that boasts 1,000 percent growth since its 1992 launch.

according to some estimates, and an Electronic Manufacturers Assoc.
survey showed 31 percent of consumers were likely to buy a converged
TV-PC in the future. (Focus, Thomas Massie, ceo, 617/938-3088; TView,

MMWIRE $$ STRATEGIES:
BIG TUNA NEW MEDIA LEVERAGES BOOK CHARACTERS VIA CD-ROMS

     Big Tuna New Media, a CD-ROM developer, is developing two CD-ROM
titles for GT Interactive [GTIS] this year and has three titles on the
block for next year, said John Sansevere, president of Big Tuna New
Media.  The 15-erson firm relies heavily on the widespread popularity
of Little Critter, a character popularized in Big Tuna's book Just
Grandma and Me, which has sold more than 80 million copies under the
Living Books imprint. The Rocksbury, Conn.-based company includes
background artists, animators, writers and storyboard artists.  This
year, Big Tuna is developing Just Me and My Mom and Little Monster
Private Eye.  It also has published more than 100 books and has
revenues of close to $5 million per year, Sansevere said.  (Big Tuna

EUROPE ONLINE GOES BANKRUPT

     Europe Online (EO) was declared bankrupt by the Luxembourg
commercial court, and its assets will be liquidated this week. 
CompuServe Corp. [CSRV] was one of several suitors that had worked to
bail out Europe Online. The court had set an Aug. 2 deadline for
bringing together a deal with new shareholders, after its largest
stakeholder, German publisher Burda GmbH, jumped ship in July. Deutsch
Telekom AG was a late bidder to save the company, while ITT Corp.
[ITT] already had made it known that it was eyeing the service.  
     Though EO had garnered only 25,000 subscribers since its March
launch, analysts called that substantial growth in a market where
income and penetration of PCs lags well behind the United States.  Lou
Kerner of Merrill Lynch pointed out that CompuServe's bid may have
been a strategy to win "mindshare" in Europe with a more familiar
name. Analysts speculated that what really hurt Europe Online was the
dropping out of its largest (one-third) shareholder, Burda. "Clearly,
they're scrambling," Kerner said.  (Europe Online, Luxembourg,

MMWIRE EARNINGS ROUNDUP:

     CyberCash Inc. [CYCH], a provider of secure transactions over the
Internet, reported revenues from credit card transactions grew to a
meager $16,086 for the quarter ending June 30. 
     The lackluster numbers are "not what's driving investor
enthusiasm," said Robertson Stephens analyst John Powers, adding,
"they're really paying for 1997, 1998 and beyond." 
     An "incredibly strong endorsement," Powers said, was Sun
Microsystems' [SUNW] decision to include CyberCash technology in
future releases of Java.
     Although the company posted a net loss of $6.2 million, or 59
cents per share, it has a $51 million "war chest," Powers said,
predicting CyberCash could be profitable by early 1998. (CyberCash
Inc., Gene Riechers, cfo, 703/716-5208; Robertson Stephens, John
Powers, analyst, 415/781-9700)

     Source Media Inc. [SRCM], which plans to roll out its
television-based Interactive Channel on Labor Day, reported revenues
for the quarter ending June 30 dipped 4 percent--to $2.3 million--from
the same period last year.
     A $2.8 million net loss for the second quarter was less than the
$3.6 million the company posted in the same period last year. (Source
