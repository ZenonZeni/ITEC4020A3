<H2> <A NAME = "SeriesI"> <A NAME = "1stgen"> First Generation 1979-1985 </H2>

<P> <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> formally started the project in
1976 when it was called X605.  The first prototype was completed in
1977.  It was introduced to America as a 79 model on April 24, 1978
since production began in March (<A HREF =
"http://aruba.ccit.arizona.edu/~rockd/brochure.html">brochure</A> (heavy
graphics)).  A slogan Mazda used was "It's the real thing. A sports car
with all the traditional virtues and then some."  One magazine's
headline was "The Rotary Revolution has begun".  Thus began Mazda's
passion for pure sport cars that has continued through three generations
and includes the Miata and <A HREF = "rx-01.html">RX-01</A>.

<P> The 12A engine (2 x 573 = 1146 cc) had two side intake ports and one
peripheral exhaust port per rotor.  There was a thermal reactor.
Transmissions were four and five speed manual and three speed auto.

<P> American models were two seaters only, though a 2+2 was offered in
Japan due to relaxed crash standards.

<P> A good <A HREF =
"http://users.aol.com/barx7club/public/1st-gen.html">rundown of
models</A> from the first generation is available from the Bay Area RX-7
club.

<H3> S Model (Base) </H3>

<H3> GS Model </H3>

<H3> P642 </H3>

<P> The P designates "production". Upgraded interior materials.
Production changed October, 1979.

<H3> P815 </H3>

<P> It appeared in August 1980.  The rear and tail lights were redesigned
eliminating the "Baroque depression".  Front bumper, air dam changed.
The Japanese variant had rotor inspired aluminum wheels.

<H3> GSL Model </H3>

<P> This began in 1980 (part of P815 run) as the "Leather Sport", 2500
units, and became the GSL in 1981.

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesII"> Series II </H3>

<P> In 1981 they were restyled, most visibly in the rear.

<H3> P130 </H3>

<P> An stop-gap version appeared in July 1982, the P130, with an improved
engine for better fuel economy.  A high output audio system was an option.
It was called "Black Dynamite".

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesIII"> P132 or <A NAME = "gslse"> GSL-SE Model 84-85 </H3>

The SE saw the re-introduction of the 13B engine, last seen in the 1978
RX-4, but now rated at 135 bhp because of Dynamic Effect Intake (DEI),
six port induction (2 by 3), and electronic fuel injection.  In Japan,
there was a P132 with a 12A turbocharged engine.  Power steering was
offered for the first time.  The interior was upgraded, but this did
not appear in the Japanese turbo version.

<H2> <A NAME = "2ndgen"> Second Generation 1986-1991 </H2>

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesIV"> First Half 86-88 </H3>

<P> The 13B engine was the only size offered.  Power was increased to
146 bhp.  The Turbo II engine had 182 bhp.

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesV"> Second Half 89-91 </H3>

<P> These are distinguishable by a return to round tail lights.  Under
the hood, horsepower was increased by 10 %.

<H2> <A NAME = "3rdgen"> Third Generation 1993 to Present </H2>

<P> The RX-7 was <EM>Motor Trend's</EM> Import Car of the Year.  The
engine comes in one version only, sequential twin turbo.

<P> The 93 RX-7 easily sustained 112-135 mph on the German Autobahn for
over 200 miles, getting 11.6 mpg.  When speed was lowered below 113 mph,
economy was raised to 14 mpg.

<HR>

<P> Much has been written about the RX-7 and there are many RX-7 pages.
I have <A HREF = "annotated.html">annotated some</A> of them.
