Civilian High-Level Radioactive Waste Management:</h2>
</head>
<hr>
<body>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Stewardship</strong>
<dd>The Nuclear Waste Policy Act obligates the Federal government to accept stewardship for our Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  The long-term management and disposal of these materials is the mission of the Office of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.  It is one of the most profound responsibilities of the Department of Energy.
<p>
<dt><strong>Environmental</strong>    
<dd>Geologic disposal is the path forward for the clean-up of defense sites and isolation of other nuclear wastes.  In the absence of a viable approach to disposal, the clean-up of nuclear weapons sites and the decommissioning of nuclear power plants translates into the perpetual management of hazardous sites for generations to come.
<p>
<dt><strong>Non-Proliferation</strong>   
<dd>President Clinton has reaffirmed the national policy of discouraging reprocessing of commercial spent fuel and the international trade in plutonium as a commercial energy source to reduce proliferation risk.
<p>
<dt><strong>International</strong> 
<dd>There is fundamental consensus among nuclear nations that deep geologic disposal is the preferred option for high-level nuclear waste.  The U.S. example in pursuing the geologic disposal strategy underwrites our international policy stance.
<p>
<dt><strong>Energy </strong>  
<dd>Spent nuclear fuel is currently stored on-site at 119 operating and shut-down reactors at 73 reactor sites in 34 states. Confidence in the ultimate removal of spent fuel is critical to public support for the optimal utilization of the existing generating capacity that serves 20% of the nation's electric energy.
<p>
<dt><strong>Equity </strong>                  
<dd>Existing law intends that the full costs of spent fuel disposal are borne by the beneficiaries of nuclear-generated electricity, and, in turn, that the Federal government will fulfill its obligation to accept the spent fuel resulting from the once-through fuel cycle.
</dl>
<p>
<strong>TWO BUSINESS CENTERS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Our program is organized around two projects or "business centers," the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and the Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation Project.
<p>
<li>The program management component provides integration, planning, and administrative support to the Director and the projects.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRESS AT YUCCA MOUNTAIN:</strong>
<p>
At Yucca Mountain:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past 3 years, drawing upon scientific studies done at the site since the 1970s, we have substantially increased the scientific and technical confidence in the suitability of the proposed repository site.
<p>
<li>Since September 1994, we have completed over one-half of the planned 5-mile Exploratory Tunnel, and are now over 50 percent ahead of schedule.  The tunnel is now well into the proposed repository horizon, and provides direct access to major geologic features.
<p>
<li> Tunneling and in-situ testing are confirming expectations.  Thus far, we have found no unexpected geologic conditions that refute the important hypotheses that we will be relying upon to provide assurance of the safety of a repository.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRESS IN WASTE ACCEPTANCE, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>We have also made substantial progress in the advancement of technologies for waste acceptance, transportation and storage.
<p>
<li> We completed the fabrication of a half-scale, high-capacity, truck cask shown here undergoing a successful droptest.
<p>
<li>We awarded a contract for the design and certification of the first multi-purpose canister (MPC) system in April of 1995.
<p>
<li>We submitted a formal report on burn-up credit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for review.  Approval of the burn-up credit methodology will substantially reduce the cost of future transport and storage technologies.
<p>
<li>We initiated the process to establish training programs for public safety officials along proposed transportation routes.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRESS IN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:</strong>
<p>
Since 1993:
<p>
<ul>
<li>We have developed a strategic plan to converge the program activities on the key objectives:<p>
     -    an early decision on the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site; and<br>
     -    the necessary capability to accept and transport waste.
<p>
<li>We have consolidated all program participants under the M&O contractor for integration and management efficiency.
<p>
<li>We have reorganized the program around two major business centers.
<p>
<li>We have improved management systems for the effective use of reduced resources.
<p>
<li>As a consequence of our planning and management improvements, we have been able to respond to budget reductions with a new plan that can preserve the major objectives of the program despite a greatly reduced level of funding, and with 1000 fewer contractor positions.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>BUDGET DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Based upon strategic planning, in 1994 we proposed a new Program Approach to meet the policy goals set by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Congress provided $522 million for that initiative.
<p>
<li>The Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation did not, however, fund continuation of that program plan.  It provided only $400 million for the program and further reserved $85 million of that amount.  We have adjusted the program plan to maintain momentum toward key program objectives while recognizing the realities of the deficit reduction era.
<p>
<li> The overall Fiscal Year 1997 budget request for the program is $400 million, of which $200 million is derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $200 million is the contribution for the Defense share of program costs. Fully 85% of the funding would support work at Yucca Mountain. 
<p>
<li>  As a result of our planning and management improvements, we have been able to develop a
program that can regain the objectives of the Yucca Mountain Project with this level of funding.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>SOURCE OF FUNDS:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>We are proposing that of the $400 million, $200 million will be derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund, and $200 million will be a contribution for the Defense share of program costs.<p>
     -    The Nuclear Waste Fund is financed by fees from the ratepayers of nuclear utilities.<br>
     -    The defense contribution is a General Fund appropriation to offset the costs of disposing of the Department's high-level waste from the nuclear weapons program.<br>
<p>
<li>This budget request is intended to be discretionary funding, entirely under the budget caps.
<p>
<li>No other legislative action is required to support the appropriation.
<p>
</ul>
<strong>RETURN ON INVESTMENT:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, coupled with aggressive management, will enable the program by 1998 to resolve the remaining significant questions concerning the viability of the Yucca Mountain repository.
<p>
<li>The target date of 2002 for a repository license application will be regained, founded upon an updated regulatory framework.
<p>
<li>Our strategies will be refined and our capability enhanced to respond quickly when the Administration and Congress agree upon a policy for interim storage.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT - $339M:</strong>
<p>
During Fiscal Year 1997:
<p>
<ul>
<li>We will complete excavation of the 5-mile Exploratory Tunnel and the construction of all major underground test alcoves.
<p>
<li>We will initiate heater tests in the repository rock to simulate heat generated by spent fuel waste packages and to allow us to study the structural and hydrologic response.
<p>
<li>We will penetrate the Ghost Dance Fault, a major geologic feature of the repository setting, first by drilling and then by tunneling. Hydrologic testing in the fault will address major questions of water movement in the mountain.
<p>
<li>We will advance the detailed designs on critical engineered waste isolation features to support the next total system performance assessment scheduled for completion during 1997.
<p>
<li>Meanwhile, we will revise the Department's repository siting guidelines to support the new plan leading to a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002 for a construction permit.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>WASTE ACCEPTANCE, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION - $10M:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As a consequence of  the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation, we cannot continue development of a multi-purpose canister (MPC) system.  We believe that the approach is sound, and private industry may elect to carry the design forward. The work on  legal-weight truck casks also will be phased out in an orderly manner. 
<p>
<li>The Fiscal Year 1997 budget request will support our legal oversight responsibilities concerning commercial spent fuel and we will conduct contingency planning for transportation and interim storage.
<p>
<li>We will examine a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector to develop that transportation capability.  Performance-based procurements would be used to obtain needed waste acquisition and shipping services at a fair
price.  Private vendors would arrange to collect spent fuel from utility sites and deliver it to a Federal facility.
<p>
<li>We also intend to engage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in pre-licensing discussions on a non-site-specific basis that can address the procedural aspects of licensing a phased interim storage facility.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRAM MANAGEMENT - $50.7M:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal Year 1997 funding for Program Management is 12.6 percent of the total program budget, down from 16.3 percent in Fiscal Year 1996, and 25 percent in Fiscal Year 1993.  We are continuing to reduce management costs to make a
greater share of our funding available to our two business centers to result in true deliverables.
<p>
<li>This funding provides for nuclear regulatory Quality Assurance, overall program planning, integration and regulatory compliance, program control, all Federal salaries, information management and contracts management.
<p>
<li>In Fiscal Year 1997, we will complete consolidation of support service contractors in our Headquarters and Yucca Mountain offices at a greatly reduced level of funding.
<p>
<li>We will also concentrate on enhancements to our program and project management systems for more efficient application of limited resources and to enable Federal managers to function with reduced contractor support.
