APPN COMPLEXITY, TOKEN RING THROUGHPUT LEAVE AS/400 OUT OF
NETWORKING GAME

Difficulties in implementing Advanced Peer to Peer Networking
(APPN) and slow Token Ring interfaces are causing the AS/400
minicomputer to fall short of its communications potential,
experts said this week.

Despite its advanced functions, IBM's 18-month-old AS/400 has not
yet become much more than a file server or terminal controller.
Users and analysts say that many of the unit's more advanced
capabilities, such as APPN, are far too complicated for the
smaller companies installing it.  The real test, they say, will
come when the AS/400 enters larger SNA networks.

When it introduced the AS/400 in June 1988, IBM made many
communications promises, including to support multiple
architectures such as SNA, OSI, and TCP/IP.  IBM said the
minicomputer would communicate and operate with both IBM and
non-IBM products.

To back up its promises, IBM introduced OS/400, the AS/400
operating system.  OS/400 contains built-in support for Advanced
Program-to-Program Communications (APPC, also known as LU 6.2),
APPN, Distributed Data Management (DDM), Token Ring, and a host of
office information architectures.

According to most observers, the AS/400 can fulfill IBM's promises
under the current OS/400 release.  But putting these capabilities
into practical use is no easy task.

COMPLEXITY NOT AVOIDED

"The need to support a confusing array of protocols and approaches
to data communication had to be satisfied without creating a
system that was difficult to program, operate, or use," stated a
1989 report from ADM Inc. (Cheshire, Conn.), an AS/400
consultancy.  "The AS/400 must support SNA while avoiding the
complexity associated with management of an SNA network."

However, most AS/400 users do not use its advanced communications
features.  Observers say that although OS/400 has the potential to
support distributed communications, APPC and APPN are too complex
to be useful to smaller users.

"APPN requires a major programming effort, and once it's done,
it's very specialized -- not for the common user," observed Bruce
Armstrong of Link Computer Corp. (Altoona, Pa.), an AS/400
remarketer.  "There's no question that APPN could solve many
problems we are seeing, but I don't seeing it solving anything
soon.  The simplicity just isn't there."

Armstrong said his company has yet to install any AS/400s in the
APPN or Token Ring environments.

TOKEN RINGS NOT THERE, EITHER

"There are a lot of AS/400 systems out there that have been
developed without a network design.  They're not set up to
[interconnect]," Armstrong said.  "We had a situation recently
where a company had 300 terminals and a mixture of PCs, but no
Token Ring activity."

One reason for the lack of Token Ring implementations may be
throughput problems, noted Armstrong.  "There are problems with
AS/400s on a Token Ring -- it has been brought up at Common [IBM's
small systems user group] meetings.  IBM still has a ways to go in
trying to get PC networks [to link with] AS/400s."

Others familiar with the AS/400's networking capabilities agreed.

"We are just starting to see Token Rings attaching to AS/400s.  We
have just gotten many clients off of coaxial cable onto twisted
pair.  Now it will be easy for them to go to Token Ring," said
George Woodring, director of technical services at ADM.  "Token
Ring takes planning and knowledge of what it can do to be
effective.  There's not that much expertise out there in the
AS/400 world."

ADM recently installed its first APPN network.

"The customer was afraid once the switch was made to APPN, he
would lose performance.  [The customer wasn't] too familiar with
what APPN could do," Woodring said.  "We did find that 9600 baud
wasn't cutting it with 16 to 18 communication lines, but we upped
it to 19.2 Kbps, and it worked fine."

LITTLE CRITICALS

Other companies -- such as the Travelers Insurance Companies
(Hartford, Conn.) and Mobil Oil (New York, N.Y.) -- have installed
APPN, but they are few and far between, according to analysts.
And even large corporations that can afford APPN networks are
doing very little mission-critical work on them.

The few AS/400s that handle communications tasks today act
as hosts in small environments or replace IBM's aging 43XX
mainframe computers.  Even there, the AS/400 serves primarily
as a stand-alone unit.

"We have 18 remote sites in the U.S. and Canada, basically spread
out in a star formation with links back to Lincoln," explained
John Edson, manager of administrative services and information
systems for Norden Laboratories (Lincoln, Neb.), a distributor of
veterinary health products.

Norden's network is based on SNA protocols, Edson said, and the
AS/400 has never had a problem communicating in that environment.

Woodring said the AS/400s he has installed have worked well in the
SNA environment.

"The biggest problem there has been [is with] customers trying to
implement it without first-hand knowledge of what it can do,"
Woodring commented.  "The initial release of OS/400 was
unforgiving if you made a mistake.  Now, it's much easier.  But
none of it is easy without some experience."

Still, within the larger SNA environment, the AS/400 cannot act as
a control point, but only as a controller.  In that role, it has
performed well, according experts.  The AS/400 will eventually
play an important role in bringing about the move to APPN,
analysts said, but it's not doing it yet.  (Michael Cooney)

IBM WILL CHANGE THE 3745, BUT MAYBE NOT UNTIL 1992

Some potential customers are re-thinking their decisions to
purchase the IBM 3745 Communication Controller because of a
rumored forklift upgrade.  Observers say the fear of major changes
in the front-end processor could be justified, but those changes
probably will not happen in 1990.

Although it has been on the market for two years, the 3745 has not
made tremendous inroads in SNA networks, observers say.  Since new
technology is making product cycles shorter and IBM has no great
stake in maintaining the 3745, some potential customers are
getting skittish.

"We had a couple of customers who were worried about IBM pulling
the plug on the 3745," commented Thad Kemp at computer lessor
Stamford Computing Group, (Stamford, Conn.).  "A couple of months
ago, that perception was a real problem, but it doesn't seem to be
bothering anyone now.  Word is that the 3745 won't be changed that
radically until 1992."

Other observers concurred with that forecast.

"We see IBM coming out with its follow-on
mainframe -- Summit -- in 1992, so we would expect to
see a new communication box sometime after that," stated
Bill Husband, senior consultant with the Meridian Group
(Deerfield, Ill.), also a computer lessor.  "The rule of thumb
we use is that for every MIP added to the machine, customers
can add 10 communications lines.  With the four to eight-fold
increase we foresee in power over the next couple years, we'll
have to see some sort of upgrade."

NOT TIME TO DUMP THE FAMILY

Since it was enhanced last May, the 3745 family covers most
customers' requirements, noted Dave Wolff, executive vice
president of El Camino Resources (Northridge, Calif.).  For most
users, however, the Network Control Program (NCP) operating system
still has a way to go.

"It is conceivable IBM could change the 3745 again, but not in the
near term," Wolff said.  "The 3745 is selling at a reasonable
clip, and the high end isn't losing to the competition like it
used to."

Indeed, IBM does not lose to too many competitors in the front-end
processor market.  According to Computer Intelligence (La Jolla,
Calif.), IBM has an 88 percent market share.  NCR Comten holds a 6
percent share, and Amdahl holds a 2 percent share.

Of this 88 percent, the 3725 still makes up the bulk of the
installed base (40 percent), with the older 3704 and 3705 coming
in second (20 percent).  The low-end 3720 comes in third (10
percent), and the 3745 thus far has garnered only 6 percent.

"It's been a slow, steady migration to the new models," observed
Ralph Busch of Computer Intelligence.  "[But] we haven't seen any
slowdown recently that would indicate a problem."

3725 IN VOGUE

Busch recommended that customers worried about the 3745 -- or
perhaps not ready to spend the money to upgrade -- should look at
buying a used 3725, which his numbers show being worth only about
10 percent of its original value.

"If all a customer needs is a little more channel space, then it
should look that way," Busch said.

Kemp pointed out that if customers are worried about floor space,
they should move to the 3745.  "The 3725  has a floor space
problem -- you'll need 3 or 4 of them to do what one 3745 does.
We know some customers who will move to the 3745 for that reason
alone."

Wolff said that if IBM changed the architecture, 3745 customers
would likely receive a field upgrade before a forklift upgrade.
But he also said the 3725 suffices for many current users.

"The 3725 is a living boat anchor that will be around for a long
time.  There is nothing that the market is crying for right now.
IBM needs to get customers to use the 3745 more for now," Wolff
said.

Some customers are turning away from IBM entirely.  Donovan Data
Systems (New York, N.Y.), for example, went to the NCR Comten
5565.  This accounting and data processing service company is
primarily a Comten shop, but has looked at the 3745.

"Basically, [the 3745] couldn't provide the flexibility we
needed," said Ron Block, vice president at Donovan.  "We needed
multiple front ends in our VTAM [Virtual Telecommunications Access
Method] environment, which IBM couldn't do."

Although Comten and Amdahl generally offer better flexibility than
Big Blue, observers said the plug-compatible vendors in the 3745
arena are not affecting the big controller much.

1990 OR 1992?

IBM is battling itself on the 3745 issue, experts say.  The
front-end device may need some changes, such as higher speeds and
water cooling to help it handle growing SNA traffic.  The unit
will need these features when it becomes an APPN node, experts
said.

"With the increased amount of 80386 -- and now 80486 -- computers
to attach to it, the 3745 will have to change.  For that and other
reasons, I don't think it will last the year," projected Brian
Jeffery, managing director of the International Technology Group
(Los Altos, Calif.).  "IBM has a lot of communication products in
the pipeline, and the new [processor] hardware coming out will
force IBM to change the 3745 soon."

Others have said the 3745 was a short-term machine to begin with
and will fade away with the advent of APPN.

"Customers expect forklift upgrades from time to time, and product
cycles have sped up," commented David Passmore, a partner at
Network Strategies/Ernst and Young (Fairfax, Va.).  "But the time
for a forklift upgrade of the 3745 is at least two years away."

IBM RINGS IN NEW MULTIVENDOR OFFICE CONNECTIONS WITH SOFT SWITCH

IBM recently rang out the old by dumping its Office Interconnect
Facility (OIF) and rang in the new by signing Soft Switch Inc. to
provide multivendor office systems connectivity in IBM
environments.

IBM signed Soft Switch (Wayne, Pa.) under its Cooperative Software
Program (CSP) to provide host-based links between its OfficeVision
system and Digital Equipment Corp.'s All-In-One, Wang Office,
Hewlett-Packard's Desk Manager, and other office systems.

Soft Switch provides these connections through its Soft Switch
Central MVS or VM software.  Soft Switch describes Central as a
"full blown networking product" with "post offices" that interface
with SNA Distribution Services (SNADS), X.400, Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), DECnet, and other protocols.

STOPGAP STOPS DEAD

Soft Switch Central replaces OIF, which IBM said was never
shipped.

Originally announced in October 1989, OIF was designed to allow
users to exchange electronic mail messages between VM PROFS
(Professional Office System), MVS Personal Services/Customer
Information Control System (PS/CICS), and Distributed Office
Support System (DISOSS), DEC, and Wang.

At the time, observers labeled OIF a stopgap measure, but it never
even got that far.

"The OIF product would not meet our customers' requirements in the
required time span," an IBM spokesman said.  "The development
effort with Aratek [Toronto, Canada] never brought a product to
market, so we withdrew it and replaced it with Soft Switch."

Aratek did not respond by press time to questions about the
developments.

The Soft Switch product will meet customer needs better than OIF
would have, according to analysts.  The OIF product did not
support X.400, and it was not robust, commented one observer.

While Soft Switch Central contains an X.400 interface, it is not
the same one the company introduced in October 1989.  The 400 Link
is a dedicated X.400 gateway between PROFS and/or SNADS and other
X.400-compatible systems.  Soft Switch said it might eventually
put 400 Link on Central, but the X.400 interface is not a
requirement today.

"The death of OIF isn't going to cause any large scale mourning
throughout the industry," observed Brian Jeffery, managing
director for the International Technology Group (Los Altos,
Calif.).  "Soft Switch is a standard in the industry, and IBM
representatives who were called upon to provide these types of
connections would have called Soft Switch anyway.  The Soft Switch
product is just so much more functional [than OIF]."

SOLIDIFYING OFFICEVISION

Soft Switch's product is also important to OfficeVision's
long-term success because it will allow customers to mix and match
multivendor office offerings -- something OfficeVision does not
provide, analysts said.

"The point of the whole product is that OfficeVision won't care
what the other system it's communicating with is," said Donald
Fisher, vice president of open systems at Soft Switch.  "The
current release of OfficeVision doesn't hold much new for PROFS
users, but the next release will have an impact.  This product
will add to that."

In addition to OfficeVision/MVS and /VM, Soft Switch supports
AS/400 Office through a SNADS gateway and said it plans to offer
support for OfficeVision/400 by June.  It will also support
OfficeVision/2 at the low end in the near future, according to
Fisher.  "We are working with IBM now to set a development
schedule, [but] I would anticipate seeing something in 1990," he
stated.

OfficeVision itself is being held up by the delayed OS/2 Extended
Edition (EE), which was slated to appear last November but is now
scheduled for March 30.  OfficeVision/2 will get much of its
functionality from OS/2 EE.

"The whole push to homogeneous computing is happening on the front
lines of many offices today.  Any package that can move
information around without the user knowing what kind of system
it's coming from is a valuable asset," commented Peter Kastner,
vice-president of the Aberdeen Group (Boston, Mass.).  "The
biggest problem is that the whole OfficeVision kit and caboodle is
on hold until OS/2 EE and the LAN Server [also due March 30] are
released."  (Michael Cooney)

PRODUCT:
Soft Switch Central

DESCRIPTION:
Software package combining IBM's OfficeVision/MVS and
OfficeVision/VM environments with multivendor office packages such
as Digital Equipment Corp.'s All-In-One and Data General's CEO.

PRICING:
$40,000 to $250,000, depending on configuration.

AVAILABILITY:
All products are available now, except for connections to
OfficeVision/2.  That interface will probably appear in 1990.

THE IBM COOPERATIVE SOFTWARE PROGRAM

Formed as a pilot program in June 1987 and initiated in January
1988, IBM's Cooperative Software Program has grown to include
approximately 75 software vendors in the U.S.

CSP's purpose is to bring in established third-party software
vendors to provide solutions in niche areas where IBM does not
offer a product.

Both IBM and its software partner (in this case, Soft Switch) sell
the programs, though IBM is not responsible for product licensing,
terms, conditions, or pricing.  The third party provides service
and training as well.

"CSP gives the software company greater exposure [to the business
world], and we get to offer our customers an established solution
for their networks," an IBM spokesman said.

IBM PUTS WEIGHT BEHIND FDDI PUSH WITH SMT FORUM MEMBERSHIP

IBM last month boosted its support of Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (FDDI) standards by joining the SMT (Station Management)
Development Forum, an organization advocating the rapid and
uniform development of SMT and FDDI.

The SMT protocol provides the intelligence that links workstations
to a network and allows those stations to be centrally managed.
SMT is the only portion of the 100 Mbps FDDI standard still
undefined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
Once SMT is resolved, vendors could begin developing interoperable
FDDI systems (see sidebar).

SMT Development Forum members will jointly define interoperable
design specifications for FDDI SMT, according to Synernetics Inc.
(North Billerica, Mass.), the FDDI LAN management specialist that
initiated the forum.  The SMT Forum specification will build on
the ANSI standard, but will provide additional details necessary
for actual product development, Synernetics said.

"The Forum provides members the benefits of a large, focused
development team at a fraction of the total cost required for
individual design specification development efforts," said Bruce
McClure, president and co-founder of Synernetics.  "The resulting
open specification will be available to all Forum members."

PUSHING FIBER

IBM's forum participation is part of its recent push into the FDDI
arena.  Last January, Big Blue invested in PCO Inc. (Chatsworth,
Calif.), a fiber optic interface company.  In September, IBM
scientists announced two experimental FDDI computer chips capable
of transmitting and receiving a billion bits per second.

"FDDI is a hot topic for IBM, and 1990 will make it even hotter,"
commented Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network
Architects (Washington, D.C.).  "I expect to see some FDDI
products in IBM's LAN environment by the end of the year."

Analysts say fiber will be the primary medium in many
organizations' future backbones as well as between LANs in campus
environments.

Big Blue's graphics-oriented data systems division (DSD, Kingston,
N.Y.) is IBM's official forum member, leading some observers to
predict that IBM will initially push FDDI in the mainframe arena.
DSD makes the 3090.

LOSING THAT COPPER BUILD-UP

An IBM executive said last year that users could eventually see
fiber "anyplace a copper cable is now."  Big Blue also said fiber
may eventually show up inside -- or at least between -- IBM
mainframes.  Analysts note that the promised peer-oriented host of
the future certainly could use the extra bandwidth and speed of a
fiber optic network.

"There are many broad requirements for integrating corporate LANs,
relational databases, and networks," commented Bob Simko,
executive director of the International Technology Group (Los
Altos, Calif.).  "This forum  offers and promotes interoperability
between all the vendors out there.  This is very much an issue
with the end user."

Simko said the forum will help IBM spread the new technology and
vault back into a technological leadership role that it slipped
from in the late 1980s.

"IBM wants to strongly apply the concept of an enterprise
information system, and it will be taking advantage of these new
types of technologies to promote that," Simko stated.  "Right now,
IBM is working to coexist with [the other members] of the forum
with the long-term goal of converging them."

Other members of the SMT Development Forum include Apple, Advanced
Micro Devices, the CERN Laboratory for Particle Physics,
Interphase Corp., Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, National
Semiconductor Corp., SBE Inc., and Sumitomo Electric.

The forum did not offer a schedule for completing the
implementation specification.  Synernetics did say it will offer
its customers full documentation, complete integration support,
and SMT software updates as the FDDI standard evolves.  (Michael
Cooney)

SMT AGREEMENT WOULD MARK MAJOR FDDI MILESTONE

The Station Management (SMT) document, the stumbling block in
passing the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard,
should be ready for approval within a few months, according to
Floyd Ross, chairman of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) SMT working group.

FDDI, which is being defined by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) X3T9.5 committee, is an emerging local area
network (LAN) standard for 100 megabit per second (Mbps)
transmission over fiber optic media.

Chairman Ross predicted that by April, the SMT committee will have
a document that will essentially be the SMT standard. "There are
only details to work out [in the next few months]," he said.

However, with a fair amount of red tape still ahead, Ross said the
standard will not be officially completed until early 1991.

According to Ross, the station manager is the focal point of
network interoperability.  "The station manager acts as the
interface between any other management entity, monitors station
activity, monitors station configuration and capabilities, and
reconfigures the stations if there is a failure on the network."

There are four documents that make up the proposed standard:
Physical (PHY), Physical Media Dependent (PMD), Media Access
Control (MAC), and  Station Management (SMT).  Each segment
defines a different set of specifications for a different aspect
of the standard.

The PHY, PMD, and MAC define hardware specifications and are
already in final draft form at ANSI.  (Caryn Fox)

1990: HOTTER THAN USUAL?

Unlike the weather over the holiday season, SNA should get a
number of "hot" developments in 1990 to warm the cockles of many
an IBM customer's heart.

Of course everything can't be warm and fuzzy, but the year should
prove interesting for a number of reasons.

One of the hottest topics for 1990 won't even be SNA, but Open
Systems Interconnect (OSI).  With IBM's OSI/Communication
Subsystem (OSI/CS) for MVS coming out in March and a VM version
due in June, the OSI acronym will fly around Armonk in '90.

OSI/CS will support OSI layers 3 through 7 and let NetView manage
local and remote OSI systems without NetView/PC, among other
functions.  Just seeing that idea on paper seems strange to many
IBM watchers.

June will also bring IBM's OSI/File Services for MVS.  As an
OSI/CS application, File Services provide OSI File Transfer,
Access, and Management (FTAM) functions for the host.  A VM
version will be shipped in September.

All of these new products will give U.S. users a chance to see
exactly how IBM really performs in the OSI realm.  It's been a
long time coming.

SMOKY NETWORK MANAGEMENT

Network management will be a hot '90 SNA topic, although IBM's
specific plans are a little hazy.  The ability to manage non-IBM
OSI devices via OSI/CS is quite a breakthrough, but how much will
it help non-OSI customers?  Probably not much.

Most network management experts say IBM will improve its
management of non-SNA devices, but none can say when that will
happen.  Until then, most customers will be left to roll their own
solutions or use NetView/PC (more on that later).

Third parties will continue to develop direct interfaces to
NetView without using NetView/PC, and users will benefit from more
efficient management of non-IBM devices.  The price tag, however,
may be high.

A Blue graphical user interface will be here in 1990, making the
recently-purchased NetCenter Graphic Network Monitor a potential
dinosaur.  Whatever happens, a big, colorful, graphic NetView
monitor is definitely in the cards for '90.

Many large network managers starving for a database repository
remained hungry in 1989.  This year should provide a few more
glimpses of IBM's direction for this lukewarm offering.  However,
since Big Blue only issued a statement of direction in '89, it
will probably be 1991 before actual products take shape.

Without question, network management issues will be hot in 1990.
Time will tell if the pot will just simmer or really boil over.

ALSO SIMMERING...

Also heating up in first quarter 1990 will be OS/2 and IBM's
OfficeVision products.

OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) 1.2 is scheduled to ship on March 30,
and with it will come a whole new array of goodies -- an SNA
gateway, Ethernet support, and a variety of other options.

From the LAN end, OfficeVision will join with OS/2 EE to sprout a
whole new crop of applications based on distributed processing.

Many observers say OfficeVision could replace IBM's Professional
Office System (PROFS) and Distributed Office Support System
(DISOSS), two key staples of the SNA network environment.  That
probably won't happen in too many shops this year, but the
possibility makes it a hot topic for 1990.

This year users should begin to reap the spoils of IBM's
all-out assault on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) market in 1989.  Experts watching the TCP/IP
field say IBM can offer TCP/IP support just about anywhere these
days -- so look for it in a network near you.

WHAT'S NOT HOT

Of course, everything can't be red hot in the Blue arena.  With
diminishing demand, the old dumb 3270 terminal will lose more face
in 1990.  Experts have been stomping on the resilient 3270
terminal for years without much real damage.  But in 1990, with
OS/2 finally showing some signs of life and some reasonable PS/2
and PC prices hitting the market, the growth of 3270 hardware will
slow even more.  Of course, "death" in this case may still mean 3
to 4 percent growth, but there are certainly some nails in its
coffin.

Another traditional slam-taker, NetView/PC, will continue taking
those slams despite picking up some new supporters in 1989.  Most
customers and third-party vendors are spending their time finding
ways to bypass NetView/PC.  Some observers go as far to say IBM
will officially pull the plug on this product in 1990.

IBM activity in the voice/data integration field cooled off in
1989, and will likely continue that route in 1990.  There could be
some interesting treaties with Northern Telecom and its peers, but
autumn is here for this area.

All in all, there seems to be more in IBM's oven than in
its deep freeze. IBM watchers predict 1990 will produce some hot
items -- at least enough to keep most customers warm.  (Michael

MOBILE COMPUTER SYSTEM COMING SOON, GARTNER SAYS

IBM may announce a mobile computer for the transportation industry
as early as the end of the quarter, according to a Gartner Group
analyst.

Mobile computers are essentially ruggedized laptops connected to a
transceiver and antenna.  IBM would not manufacture the latter
components, only the computer itself, said John Pemberton, an
analyst at Gartner (Stamford, Conn.).  Current mobile systems
generally use a non-intelligent terminal, rather than computer,
for data entry.

By switching to intelligent mobile systems, users could implement
distributed mobile applications, Pemberton noted.  If IBM made
them Systems Application Architecture (SAA) compatible, mobile
systems would become more useful to IBM customers, he said.

IBM planned to enter the market in the third quarter, but moved up
the announcement to the first quarter, Pemberton said.  The
machines will ship no later than first quarter 1991, but IBM is
aiming to beat that deadline, he added.

To be successful in the field, the systems must be accepted by the
major communication companies.  IBM has been courting Qualcomm,
American Mobil Satellite Corp., Telsat Mobile Inc., Geostar, and
other satellite communications companies to ensure this
acceptance, according to Pemberton.  Negotiations with Locstar
will be critical to the system's success in western Europe, he
observed.  (Dan Carney and Michael Cooney)

SNA WILL REMAIN IBM'S BABY DESPITE GROWING OSI INVESTMENT

IBM will continue to pour the majority of its research and
development (R&D) dollars into SNA, but the computer giant has
made a definitive investment in OSI, according to a recent Neil
Miles Ltd. (New York, N.Y.) research report.

"IBM is never going to do what some of its competitors are doing,
like DEC  [Digital Equipment Corp.] and HP [Hewlett-Packard Co.],
and that is replace its proprietary network protocols with OSI.
IBM will offer the ability to mix and match [SNA and OSI]," said
report author Rob Garretson.

The "Gateway To The Future" report does not break down the dollar
proportions spent on R&D for SNA and OSI, Garretson said, but it
does say while IBM has started a multi-million dollar OSI effort,
it will continue to spend billions on SNA development.

"I would say the proportion of development resources is at least
10 to one SNA to OSI," Garretson said.  He added that IBM spends
"tens of billions of dollars in R&D with a very wide palette of
research" but R&D is still heavily weighted towards SNA.

"Though IBM is making its first real definitive investment in OSI,
SNA is still [IBM's] baby," said Garretson.

Big Blue will provide multivendor portals to all customers who
want them, according to the report.  Garretson said an IBM
customer will have the option of using X.25 as the main transport
protocol across its SNA network, replacing IBM's Synchronous Data
Link Control (SDLC) protocol for wide area networking. (Beth

KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOFTWARE TOOL UNVEILED

IBM last week announced The Integrated Reasoning Shell (TIRS), an
application enabling tool that will help businesses create and use
knowledge-based applications within Big Blue's AD/Cycle and
Systems Application Architecture (SAA) frameworks.

IBM said the shell will make it easer for customers to
build specialized libraries of information and apply them to
problem-solving situations.  These knowledge bases can be
developed on OS/2 or AIX and run on the PS/2, AIX/RT, and S/370 VM
or MVS using the Runtime System.

Scheduled to be available in July, TIRS will cost $7,500 for the
Development System and $750 for the Runtime System on the PS/2 and
RT.  System/370 prices will range from $11,000 to $113,000 for the
Development System and $3,000 to $28,000 for the Runtime system.

MADGE NETWORKS INTRODUCES SOFTWARE DRIVER FOR SMART AT, MC
RINGNODES

Madge Networks Inc. (San Jose, Calif.) has introduced a software
driver that it says gives its 4 Mbps Smart AT and MC Ringnodes the
performance of IBM's 16 Mbps Token Ring.  Madge's Smart Server
software uses the IBM PS/2's busmaster capabilities and leaves the
CPU free by offloading low-level network activity onto the Token
Ring adapter.

The Smart Server automatically configures itself to the interrupts
and I/O of the Smart Ringnode and is compatible with Micro Channel
and AT-style PCs, Madge said.  Scheduled to be available this
quarter, Smart Server will be offered free to current Madge Smart
AT and MC Ringnode users.
