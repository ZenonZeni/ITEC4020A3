<I><FONT SIZE=2>Objective</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The primary objective of the Task is to examine the
role of NSDW in a) facilitating colonisation of the temperate
northeast Atlantic rim ecosystem by <I>C. finmarchicus</I> which
is essentially a sub-Arctic species in terms of its global distribution,
and b) potentially providing a link or teleconnection between
the various ecosystems thereby leading to a degree of synchrony
in their responses to climatic forcing.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
The ability of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> to colonise repeatedly the
northern North Sea ecosystem during the spring and summer is hypothesised
to be in part a consequence of the overflow of Norwegian Sea Deep
Water (NSDW) through the Faroe-Shetland Channel into the Atlantic,
and the propensity for <I>C. finmarchicus</I> to accumulate and
overwinter in this water mass (Backhaus et al, 1994). The juxtaposition
of the Faroe-Shetland Channel and the northwest European shelf
is such that a high proportion of copepodites emerging from depth
in the spring are assured of successful colonisation of the North
Sea under a range of weather conditions, whilst the deep vertical
migration of late stage copepodites washed out of the North Sea
in the autumn will return at least a part of the population to
the NSDW for overwintering. The extension of this hypothesis to
be addressed in this Task is that a similar association between
<I>C.finmarchicus</I> and NSDW operates along the mid-shelf west
of Norway, on Faroe Plateau, and along the southern and southwestern
coast of Iceland. If this is the case then correlated trends in
the seasonal dynamics of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> in each of these
systems may be explained in terms of ocean scale circulation patterns.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The objectives of the subtask are to a) track the
NSDW overflow between Faroe Bank and Faroe Plateau, across the
Iceland-Faroe Ridge, and along the shelf edge off southern Iceland,
and to determine the association between this water and overwintering
<I>C.finmarchicus</I>, and b) to determine the routes for invasion
of these shelf ecosystems by <I>C.finmarchicus</I> in the spring.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Knowledge of the deep water circulation and overwinter
distribution of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> around the Greenland-Scotland
Ridge is sketchy in some areas. The southerly flow of NSDW through
the Faroe-Shetland Channel is only a small part of the outflow
from the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the North Atlantic.
Most of the outflow is through the Denmark Strait west of Iceland.
Further flows are found between Iceland and Faroe. NSDW in the
Faroe-Shetland Channel rarely flows over the Wyville-Thomson Ridge,
but mainly passes through the gap between Faroe-bank and Faroe
Plateau. Hydrodynamic considerations suggest that this water should
constitute a constrained deep plume flowing in a northwesterly
direction along the Atlantic face of the Iceland-Faroe Ridge which
will be augmented by overflow across the Ridge. Such a feature
has been identified as a deep cold water mass along the slope
off southern Iceland (Malmberg and Magnusson, 1982). The NSDW
in the Faroe-Shetland Channel contains high concentrations (&gt;100/m</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>)
of stage V <I>C. finmarchicus</I> during the winter months. If
the water mass remains identifiable along the Atlantic face of
the Ridge and off southern Iceland, then it is hypothesised that
<I>C. finmarchicus</I> will also be found in these areas during
the winter. The modelling subtask (5) will be able to predict
the timing and location of spring invasions of the Faroese and
southeastern Iceland shelf regions by <I>C. finmarchicus</I> originating
from such deep subsurface features, and thus sampling the distribution
of animals in the spring will provide a valuable validation of
the models and a comparative test of the generality of the Backhaus
hypothesis.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The campaign of field surveys will:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>a) map the distribution and physiology of <I>Calanus</I>
in relation to hydrography in the winter (December-January) around
the Faroe plateau, Faroe Bank, the ridge between Faroe and Iceland,
and along the southern shelf of Iceland. The specific objective
of this campaign will be to establish the spatial extent of the
association between <I>C. finmarchicus</I> and water of Norwegian
Sea origin which is expected to be found at depths &gt;500m, and
to track the overflow plume of NSDW along the Atlantic face of
the Greenland-Scotland ridge.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>b) sampling of <I>Calanus</I> distribution and physiology
in the spring (February-April) in the area between Scotland and
Iceland. The specific objectives of this campaign will be first
to establish the specific localities where <I>Calanus</I> first
invades the Faroe and Iceland continental shelves, and to confirm
the invasion pattern of the European Shelf detected during ICOS.
Second, to determine the routes and rates of spreading from the
shelf edge invasion area onto each of the shelf regions, and the
distribution of reproductive activity in relation to phytoplankton
activity.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>c) collection of fine spatial scale hydrographic
and vessel mounted acoustic doppler current profiler data on the
shelf edge currents in the area to be covered by the hydrodynamic
modelling activity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Standard transects will be completed on each occasion,
forming a baseline for intercomparison of data from the various
campaigns, together with a more widespread network of sampling
locations covering the shelf margins. The &quot;standard transects&quot;
will coincide with nationally established monitoring stations
in Icelandic, Faroese and UK shelf regions so that the data can
be viewed in the context of long-term variability in conditions.
A critical component of the plankton sampling is the ability to
collect fine vertically resolved (20-40m) samples from depth down
to 1000m, together with in-situ particle counts. Equipment to
perform this task is already available in the project (MLA) and
can be deployed from a variety of survey vessels.<BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>C.finmarchicus </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>dominates
the mesozooplankton in Icelandic waters as elsewhere in the North
Atlantic (Conover 1988, Astthorsson et al. 1983, Astthorsson and
Gislason 1995), and it constitutes an important food for fish
larvae on the main spawning grounds of the commercially most important
Icelandic fish stocks (e.g cod, haddock, capelin) south and southwest
of Iceland. The spring spawning of <I>C. finmarchicus </I>lasts
from March to May, and there is both regional and between year
variability in the timing of spring spawning in the area (Gislason
et al. 1994, Gislason and Astthorsson 1995). However, the reasons
for this variability are not clear. Given that the year class
strength of the fish stocks is determined during the first feeding
period this variability has large implications for the recruitment
to the fish stocks (Cushing 1990). The sea area south and southwest
of Iceland (the Iceland Basin and the Irminger Sea) is probably
an important overwintering site for the <I>Calanus </I>stocks
southwest of Iceland and these regions may be of the same importance
as overwintering areas for <I>Calanus</I> in Icelandic waters
as the Norwegian basin is for the stocks in Norwegian waters and
the Barents sea. However, a part of the stock may also overwinter
over the shallower banks. No study exists which has been specially
designed to study the overwintering of <I>Calanus </I>south and
southwest of Iceland, and the emergence and advection of overwintered
animals onto the banks south and west of the island.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Methodology</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A comprehensive sampling of the horizontal and vertical
distribution of <I>C. finmarchicus </I>will be carried out in
late winter and spring 1996 and 1997 using vessels from MRI. The
sampling will be carried out on several cruises in 1996 (January-July)
and 1997 (January-April). During each survey the sampling will
be conducted at standard sections south and southwest of Iceland.
These transects are selected because they run across the main
spawning grounds and larval drift route of the major Icelandic
commercial fish stocks. Further, long term data (since 1971) on
hydrography, phytoplankton production and zooplankton biomass
are available from these transects, and to which the TASC-data
can be compared. Sampling gear: Hydrography: Seabird Electronics

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Objective</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To determine trends and seasonal cycles in abundance
of <I>Calanus </I>in different regions of the NE Atlantic and
examine evidence for correlations between regions, by extending
the statistical time series analysis of data from the Continuous
Plankton Recorder (CPR) surveys carried out for the North Sea
during ICOS to include a wider area of the North Atlantic and
Norwegian Sea, and draw this together with an analysis of historical
time series data from Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian and Russian
sources.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although dedicated field programmes can provide exceptional
insight into the processes governing <I>Calanus </I>population
dynamics, they rarely give any indication of long term trends
or mean seasonal signals. Such information is vital for characterising
different ecosystems and the similarities between them, and for
revealing the effects of long-term change. For this purpose, long-running
time series data are required. The Continuous Plankton Recorder
Surveys are a well known source of time series data for the North
Atlantic and other oceans. Although sampling first started in
1931 in the North Sea, routine sampling, which meets the standards
of present day procedures, commenced in 1946 with monthly resolution
along a number of routes across the northeast Atlantic. These
data thus constitute a spatial time series extending in some localities
over several decades and which can be used to make seasonal comparisons
between specific areas. Data therefore exist in the CPR database
to compare off and on shelf populations of <I>Calanus </I>species
as well as create time series of changes in population levels
in specified areas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, various long-term data sets on zooplankton
species abundances have been collected by national organisations
in their own territorial waters. Although these may lack the temporal
resolution of the CPR data, they have the advantage in most cases
of being depth integrated rather than simply sampled from the
upper 10m. These data thus represent a powerful complement to
the CPR records, providing an opportunity to 'calibrate' the CPR
data and validate the long term trends. Assimilation, and in some
cases archaeology and recovery of these data for the TASC project
is therefore an important activity. Specific data have been identified
in Iceland (MRII), the Faroe Islands Fisheries Laboratory, and
at PINRO in Murmansk, Russia. For example the Icelandic data have
been collected during May-June each year since 1961. The material
has recently been analysed with respect to long term trends in
biomass (Astthorsson and Gislason, 1995). However, the series
also contains information on zooplankton composition and the stage
structure of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>, but these data have never
been analysed. Similarly, the Russian date set contains zooplankton
biomass observations from May and July each year since 1959.Relatively
little work has been reported on modelling either the CPR data
series, or many of the national banked data on zooplankton time
series. The identification of such models leads to effective summaries
of the series in terms of model structure and parameters, and
hence facilitates comparisons between species in different locations
and at different times. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Methodology</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Supply of additional CPR data, beyond those obtained
in respect of ICOS, will be negotiated with the Sir Alister Hardy
Foundation, UK. Long term data from sampling in Icelandic waters
is currently in manuscript form and will be collated and digitised
at MRII. Similarly, access to data for Faroese waters will be
negotiated. Comprehensive data on zooplankton in the Barents and
Norwegian Seas are known to exist at the PINRO in Murmansk. These
will be collated and digitised through collaboration between UIT&Oslash;
and local scientists in Russia (Degtereva 1979). The approach
to analysing the CPR and other data will have two main thrusts.
The first of these is data analytic. This consists of identifying
and developing smoothing and filtering procedures for the estimation
of the long term trend and the annual seasonal cycle for each
series. Considerable care and ingenuity will be required to extract
accurate and reliable estimates because of the frequent sparsity
of the individual time series and the fact that the observations
are interrupted by sequences of zeros. In addition, the data are
subject to spatio-temporal variability in sampling intensity,
and this should be taken into account in any statistical analysis
and modelling. The second effort consists of the construction
and validation of suitable time series models for individual series.
The mixed nature of the data, referred to above, necessitates
the use of non linear time series modelling, a major area of current
research interest.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>To describe the across shelf transport of <I>Calanus
</I>along the shelf edge from M&oslash;re to Lofoten, and identify
the physical and biological factors responsible for the switch
from a two generation to an annual generation pattern along the
Norwegian midshelf sector.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the entire study area <I>C. finmarchicus </I>alters
between 1-3 generations a year. These patterns are only crudely
defined on a regional basis. The general situation is that the
number of generations decreases going from low latitudes to higher,
and the literature indicate a 2 generation pattern around the
British Isles, Faroe Island and even up to the Western coast of
Norway (Wiborg 1955). Lofoten, is often referred to as the northern
demarcation line for this two generation cycle (Lie 1965, Tande
1991), but substantial gaps in our knowledge of this issue are
lacking. Combining the ontogenetic vertical behavior with the
prevailing current pattens along the Norwegian shelf might clarify
the condition. Surface currents will tend to bring the reproducing
females and the recruits northwards, while a progressively deeper
position in the water column will tend to reduce the speed of
this transport. At some stage in the growth cycle, information
are imposed making CIV and CV capable of deciding on how to proceed:
continuing to moulting or descending to diapause. The proportion
of CIV and CV recruited from the overwintering generation, leaving
for diapause in May and June will certainly increase with latitude
going from M&oslash;re to Lofoten. Unpublished data on CIV and
CV dry weight from the shelf and the shelf break outside Troms&oslash;,
do indicate that the copepod body size varies with depth and time
during the productive season. This region from M&oslash;re to
Lofoten should be revisited several times during the spring and
summer period. Although the physical conditions are well studied,
this project will be organised as a multidisiplinary study with
strong basis in physical oceanography and modelling.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Methodology</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The project will visit the midshelf from M&oslash;re
to Lofoten during three cruises each of 10 days duration with
R.V. &quot;Jan Mayen&quot; in February, April, May and July in
1996. On the cruises in 1996, the physical oceanography of the
area will be detailed by CTD (including Flouresence and Light
measurements) and the current patterns will be obtained by continous
records from ADCP. These will provide input data to a well developed
physical model already at hand at SINTEF (Slagstad, 1995). The
vertical and horizontal distribution of life stages will be compared
between onshelf and deeper offshelf areas at selected sites from
M&oslash;re to Lofoten. Vertical profile sampling will be carried
out by MOCNESS and with the MLA in-situ particle counter (subtask
1). During this time period the proportion between CIV/CV from
G1 descending to depths or contining to reproduction will be inferred
from potential differences in sex-differentiation in CV, sex-ratios
and maturation patterns in adult females, dry weight, prosome
lengths and physiological activity.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>a) To model the finely resolved flow field at the
shelf edge in each of the following areas - S Iceland, Faroe,
Shetland, W. Norway. b) To explain the observed seasonal evolution
of <I>Calanus </I>distribution and abundance in each of the above
regions using particle tracking models driven by simulated flow
fields.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The hypothesis behind the task is that the seasonal
colonisation of the shelf seas from the adjacent ocean basin depths
by <I>Calanus </I>depends on an interaction between copepod behaviour
and the characteristic flow fields in the surface waters, especially
the continental slope currents, and the less energetic deep circulation
patterns which form a link between the various shelf regions.
Simulation and sensitivity analysis of this phenomenon requires
a combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modelling and lagrangian
particle tracking. Three types of model development are required
for the task. The first is the application of a system of 3 nested
hydrodynamic models to previously unmodelled shelf edge regions,
to provide high resolution (4km grid spacing, 1hr time resolution)
flow field simulations of the continental slope currents. The
second is the development of a new model system to simulate the
circulation and overflow of Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) through
the Denmark Strait and around and over the Iceland-Scotland Ridge.
The third development is the coupling of flow fields generated
by these models to a particle tracking model including the facility
to include biological properties and responses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Methodology</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At present, a nested model system exists only for
the northwest Scottish shelf edge (in the NE Atlantic) as a product
of the ICOS project (MAS2-CT94-0085). In the proposed task, the
same approach will be applied to model the Faroese, Icelandic
and Norwegian shelf edge waters. Similarly, particle tracking
schemes to make use of the simulated flow field have been developed
during ICOS and will be applied to the new regions, but will require
to be extended to accommodate application of the proposed development
of circle-map models of generation cycle characteristics (Subtask
14). The modelling of NSDW circulation and overflow will be a
completely new development. The basis for the hydrodynamic models
will be the HAMSOM (Hamburg Shelf-Ocean Model) finite difference
coding which has evolved from an original model developed by Backhaus
(1985). The model systems will be used to carry out a sensitivity
analysis of the scope for variability in climatological forcing
at a variety of scales to influence the success of <I>Calanus
</I>in colonising the various shelf regions, and in the scope
for correlations in population characteristics between shelf regions
resulting from a teleconnection through the deep water circulation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The modelling work will be shared by three partners.
IFM will develop and apply the hydrodynamic models for the regions.
SINTEF and MLA have collaborated in developing the particle tracking
scheme in IOCS and will continue to do so in TASC. As in ICOS,
the Lagrangian simulations will be run separately from the hydrodynamic
model by transferring the output data from the HAMSOM model to
SINTEF and MLA for further applications.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Describe the large scale distribution, abundance,

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The population dynamics of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
in the Nordic Seas are influenced both by local environmental
conditions and advection which transports individuals between
different regions. We hypothesise that a core habitat of the species
is the large scale gyre in the Norwegian Sea, and that its life
cycle has been shaped by adaptation to the specific conditions
of seasonal primary production and predation from migratory (e.g.
herring) and non-migratory predators (e.g. mesopelagic fishes,
invertebrates). Within its range of distribution, <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
encounters a wide range of environmental and biological conditions,
e.g. in the seasonal variation in light, primary production, temperature
and predation. This is likely to be reflected in the number of
generations produced and in the success of their completion. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although numerous scientific papers have focused
on <I>C. finmarchicus</I> the last 50 years, information has mainly
been gathered through sampling in limited parts of its distributional
area. Hence, basic quantitative population dynamics of this species
are known primarily for certain enclosed fjord areas. Advection
will influence any time series obtained at a fixed position in
the open ocean. For this reason there is a need to sample a wider
area in order to allow for an estimate of the role of advection.
By describing the abundance and population structure in summer
when the cohorts of developing copepodites are present in the
upper layer, one can get information on the timing of the seasonal
development of the new generation and the likely number of generations
in different regions. This will allow identification of areas
where the second generation is underway, where the first generation
have descended into deeper water, where the first generation show
a late development, and areas where situations intermediate between
these exist. This large scale pattern of generational development
can be related to the strong latitudinal gradient in light, the
strong temperature gradient from East to West, and the advection
by the large scale circulation system of the Nordic Seas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Surveys of the distribution, abundance and population
structure of the overwintering population of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
in the Nordic Seas will be carried out to identify overwintering
areas which are of importance for the population dynamics and
summer distribution.The northwards flowing Atlantic Current on
the eastern side of the Nordic Seas branches out into the cyclonic
gyres of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. This circulation allows
for the possibility of &quot;generation stacking&quot;, where
the second generation originating from initial spawning in the
southern regions descends to overwinter in the same areas where
the first generation from spawning further north has also descended.
The distribution pattern of overwintering <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
will determine the source populations which ascend into the upper
ocean advective current regime to spawn the following winter.

<FONT SIZE=2>Genetic cohesiveness of a species gene pool is both
a determinant and a result of the evolutionary and ecological
forces acting on that species population. The genetic cohesiveness
of a species' population will determine likelihood of raciaton
or speciaton events, responses to environmental change, probability
of extinction, and rates of evolution. Furthermore, a species'
genetic cohesiveness across its distributional range may be used
as an indicator of the linkage among ecostystems. If genetic exchange
among sub-populations of a number of important species at different
trophic levels is sufficiently small, ecosystems may be said to
be functionally distinct. Conversely, high levels of gene flow
suggest that dynamic processes in the different ecosystems are
functionally interrelated. Circulation patterns in the Norwegian
Sea and the adjacent regions may facilitate development of planktonic
subpopulations. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Summer distributions of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> will
be determined by sampling with MOCNESS, BIONESS or MULTINET multiple
sampling systems and WP-2 nets, and by acoustical mapping with
shipborne echo sounders (38, 120, 200 kHz). Supporting information
on hydrography (CTD), phytoplankton development (nutrients, chlorophyll,
in situ fluoresence), zooplankton size-fractioned biomass, and
distribution and abundance of fish (acoustics, pelagic trawl)
will be collected by continuous recording and vertical profiling.

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This study of genetics will use the frequencies of
different alleles of several genes to describe population structure.
Allelic variation of the genes will be determined by variation
in the DNA sequence of a portion of each gene for individual copepods.
DNA will be extracted from individual copepodes. A region of mitochondrial
DNA will be amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology
(Innis et al. 1990). Specific techniques are described in Bucklin
and Kann (1991) and Stanton et al. (1992). Amplified DNA will
be sequenced, and sequences will be alligned to those of other
individuals of C. finmarchicus from the Norwegian Sea. The DNA
sequencing will be carried out at University of Bergen where we
have access to an Automated DNA Sequencer. The frequency of each
sequence variant in each region will be determined. Standard population
genetic analyses of population stucture based on allele frequencies
will be done to determine whether the species is significantly
stuctured in the Norwegian Sea.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Describe the annual cycle of vertical distribution,

</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale:</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are few time series available which describe
the full annual cycle of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> with sampling
over an extended part of the water column and temporal resolution
of less then a month. The few available time series are mainly
from fjords and coastal waters (Tande 1982, Matthews et al. 1978).
An exception is the unique time series obtained by weekly sampling
at weathership station &quot;M&quot; in the Norwegian Sea (&Oslash;stvedt
1955). The annual cycle of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> depends on a
number of factors and conditions: stage and state at the beginning
of overwintering, temperature and activity during overwintering,
maturation and ascent, temperature and feeding conditions for
reproduction and cohort development, number of generations, and
timing and duration of overwintering. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We will conduct a coordinated and comparative sampling
programme in order to describe the annual cycle of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
at selected locations in and surounding the Nordic Seas and in
waters south of Iceland. The programme will consist of two components:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1. Frequent sampling (about two weeks interval) at
near-shore locations at the south coast of Iceland, the Faroese,
Shetland, and Lofoten in Norway, and at the weathership at station
&quot;M&quot; in the eastern Norwegian Sea. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2. Less frequent sampling (2-10 weeks interval depending
on season and practicality) at oceanographic sections across the
shelf and out into the deep ocean at the east and northeast coast
of Iceland, at the Faroese, and at M&oslash;re and Vester&aring;len
in Norway (see map Fig. 1).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The main programme will be carried out in 1997 coordinated
with a similar programme in the northwestern Atlanitc by US GLOBEC
and possibly Canada. Part of the sampling programme will also
be carried out in 1996. The results on the population structure
and dynamics of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> from the time series sampling
programme will be interpreted against the background of information
on advection by the large scale circulation system which transport
and redistribute the population, and on the distribution of <I>C.

<FONT SIZE=2>Assess mortality risk of <I>Calanus</I> with respect
to visual predators (fish) along a latitudinal gradient in the
Norwegian Sea and how this impacts plankton vertical distribution
and life history traits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Latitudinal and seasonal gradients in light conditions
are fundamental elements of the Norwegian sea ecosystem, probably
with profound impact on predator-prey relationships between visual
predators and <I>Calanus</I>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We will address the following hypotheses:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1. Northern stocks of <I>Calanus</I> to a large extent
leave upper layers for overwintering in early summer (&Oslash;stvedt
1955). We hypothesize that the early descent is due to an unprofitable
trade&#173;off between food intake and danger of predation in
regions/seasons with mid&#173;night sun or very short dark periods.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2. Horizontally migrating fish (e.g. herring and
mackerel) are major visual predators on <I>Calanus</I> during
summer (Melle et al. 1994). By relying on their schooling behaviour
and rapid swimming in predator avoidance, they may forage in upper
layers by day.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>3. Resident, mesopelagic fish performing diel vertical
migrations (<I>Benthosema glaciale, Maurolicus muelleri</I>) are
major predators on <I>Calanus</I> in periods/regions with day/night
cycles, but not in periods/regions with mid-night sun. They feed
actively on near surface copepod assemblages during short &quot;antipredatory
windows&quot; near sunset and sunrise, and their large eyes possibly
also facilitates fairly efficient feeding during night (Giske
et al. 1990, Aksnes &amp; Giske 1993). They do not prey on <I>Calanus</I>
during day in seasons when the copepods inhabit upper layers.
An unprofitable light climate for feeding conditions may reduce
the success of mesopelagic fish at high latitudes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>4. <I>Calanus</I> overwintering depth in the Norwegian
sea is related to the prevailing predatory field with mesopelagic
fish playing a key role. In the presence of mesopelagic fish,
oceanic stocks of <I>Calanus</I> descend to great depths during
winter since these fishes are foraging efficiently at low light
intensities. In waters devoid of mesopelagic fish, however, <I>Calanus</I>
may select an overwintering depth without being constrained by
visual predators. If mesopelagic fish are excluded (or strongly
reduced in numbers) at high latitudes, this may impact habitat
choice of <I>Calanus</I> during winter. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>5. <I>Calanus</I> exhibits flexibility in selection
of overwintering depth with respect to presence of prevailing
predators<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Methodology</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Studies on zooplankton vertical distribution will
be done by MOCNESS, Multinet, WP2 net, Juday net or by pump. Fish
will be assessed acoustically (SIMRAD EK 500, 38 Khz), and by
Harstad trawl. Studies on the impact of mid&#173;night sun will
be performed on cruises with &quot;Jan Mayen&quot; in May and
July 1996, and on a cruise with &quot;Haakon &quot;Mosby&quot;
from waters off Bergen to north of the polar circle the summer
of 1997. Studies on migration and feeding by mesopelagic fish
will be carried out along the same transects. Egg production measurements
(by incubation) will be done along the same transect. Animals
for gut fluorescence measurements will be sampled day and night.
Size fractionated chlorophyll measurements will be performed to
assess field feeding conditons. Studies on the vertical distribution
of <I>Calanus </I>along a latitudinal gradient during winter will
be done in cooperation with the Institute of Marine Research,
Bergen, using their research vessels. The flexibility in selection
of overwintering habitat will also be addressed by comparative
studies the vertical distribution of <I>Calanus</I> in fjords
with, and without mesopelagic fish. Two-day cruises with the research
vessel &quot;Hans Brattstroem&quot; will be carried out each month
(budget permitting) from the summer 1996 to spring 1997, complemented
by cruises with RV &quot;Haakon Mosby&quot; spanning several days.
We will synthesize data on herring and mackerel abundance, distribution
and feeding to get a rough estimate on their potential pedation

<FONT SIZE=2>Some of the data management needs in TASC are fairly
conventional in character for the CTD data type. Small data sets
of currents measurements from shipborn ADCP, will be aquired during
the project, but plans have to be developed in the project in
order to handle these data as they are considered important for
the validation of large and nested hydrodynamic models in some
of the subtasks. Here TASC will build on experience attained in
OMEX and other projects which have been frequently using ADCP
for current measurements. Other, small data sets from laboratory
and mesocosms experiments, will be aquired during the project,
but no plans have been made to handle these data as they are required
by individual researchers, and are considered to be of minor value
to the overall TASC database. On the other hand, the data bank
for the zooplankton, providing information on biomass and demography
in the TASC study area will be established. This is considered
a major challenge in this subtask. Since ICES will be doing the
plankton management, for the Arctic Ocean Grand Challenge, if
approved, ICES and IMR will work closely to ensure compatible
as possible procedures for managing zooplankton data in various
proposed EU projects in this area.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Institute of Marine Research has designed an
Ingres relation database that include all type of marine data.
The database is designed as a generic structure in order to allow
for the integration of data. This implies that new types of data
can be modelled to fit into the database. For the present data
from CTD, nutrients, plankton, fish egg and larvae and fish is
modelled for the database. IMR have worked out routine for quality

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The eastern part of the Norwegian Sea receives warm
Atlantic water mainly through the Faroe -Shetland channel. This
water flows northward along the eastern continental slope. Since
the temperature is higher here than elsewhere, the growth rate
and the number of generations per year is higher than in other
parts of the Norwegian Sea. New generations of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
are usually developing in the upper 300 m where the northward
transport is fast. A female that ascends from its overwintering
depth North of Shetland may produce offsprings that, after two
or three generations descend to deep water outside Northern Norway
in late summer. How can the southern population maintain itself
when the advection losses apparently should dilute the stock rapidly?
Is the productivity of the Northern stock (Lofoten Basin) in the
long run dependent on supply from the Norwegian Basin stock? Southward
transport may take place as a counter flow below the slope current
or in the basin wide gyres. It may take years to complete this
cycle.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Methodology</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The answers to the questions addressed here can only
be acheived through a combined, basin wide hydrodynamical model
coupled to a life cycle model of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>. Typically
model simulations periods will be a year or more. Since there
are many uncertainties both in the biology of <I>Calanus</I> and
the current field when such long term simulations are performed,
model investigation will concentrate on scenarios and sensitivity
tests. Three climatic cases will be simulated: Climatic average
with monthly mean flow field and temperatures, and two cases with
high and low inflow of Atlantic water, respectively, using daily
average flow. These simulations will be performed by the ECOM-3D
which is already established for the area by HI. Climatological
mean flow is already available (Engedahl et al. 1995). Modelling
deep circulation depends to a large degree on a correct density
field. Improvement of the existing field by available observations
will be performed before the last two scenarios are produced.
The elements that comprise a life cycle model (generation time,
developmental rate and vertical migration behaviour, survival
probability), are investigated in other subtasks. The life cycle
model will be of a Lagrangian type where particles having attached
state variables. Each particle is allowed to develop (change state),
die and reproduce by spawning of new particles having state variables
typical for off-springs. Several scenarios will be performed were
parameters (and assumptions) in the life cycle model are perturbed
for each of climatic cases.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The only data on the complete seasonal reproductive

a strong regional variability of the beginning of the spawning
season, usually associated with the spring bloom, has been observed,
although microzooplankton was shown to be an adequate substitute
for phytoplankton as a food source. It has been known for a long
time that <I>C. finmarchicus</I> can breed through up to three
generations per year, but the regional variability of the number
of generations is not at all understood. The time series work
at weathership &quot;M&quot; and selected stations on cruises

on experience with <I>C. helgolandicus</I>, cultures of which
are currently maintained over multiple generations at PML. This
approach will provide relevant information for understanding life

of the population dynamics model (subtask 14). The culture facility

mechanisms determining life history strategy, and enable new biochemical

based on suggestions from the field programme. The effect of environmental

<I>Calanus</I> population dynamics in the laboratory. It is an
ultimate goal to have both sibling species in simultaneous culture,
enabling critical comparative physiological studies to be made

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An increased effort in nutritional biochemistry,
particularly lipid biochemistry, exploring the dietary links between
<I>Calanus </I>and its food environment will significantly advance
understanding of the relationships between diet and production.
Dietary diversity is expected to enhance production. Recognising
the importance of omnivory (Kleppel, 1993), new approaches are
needed to establish relations between food quantity and quality,
and development rate and egg production.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is well established that lipids play a vital role
in the life history strategies of polar organisms (Sargent et
al., 1993). However, it is poorly understood: a) how environmental
variables determine the production of lipids in the marine environment
and hence the availability to <I>C. finmarchicus</I>, b) the rate
at which dietary lipid is ingested/assimilated by <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
and/or biosynthesised in the field, c) if, in some circumstances,
the availability of essential dietary lipids in the marine environment
affects the growth and reproduction of <I>Calanus. </I>Optimal
growth and egg production by <I>Calanus </I>requires an adequate
food composition; some essential fatty acids, for example, cannot
be synthesised by copepods. It is not clear whether the natural
food environment is generally adequate in dietary terms, or whether
<I>Calanus </I>spp. are sometimes limited by food composition
in nature as opposed to food concentration. This needs to be determined;
it is important to establish whether fecundity is driven by food
characteristics, and to incorporate this critical linkage in models.
This component of TASC will interact strongly with the proposed
field programme, by providing key analytical and shipboard (weathership

<FONT SIZE=2>A two year cultivation study of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
from eggs to adults will be conducted. We will compare and contrast
responses in growth pattern, developmental and mortality schedules
to variations in physical settings among cohorts from two geographically
distinct populations. These populations should potentially have
different history and physiological adaptations. Eggs from a northern
(Gr&oslash;tsund, 70 </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>o</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>N)
and from a southern population (Trondheimsfjorden, 63 </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>o</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>N)
will be obtained at the two sites, and brought to one mesocosm
site. We will perform two such experiments - one in 1996 and one
in 1997. The hatched nauplii, from the two sites, will be raised
in triplicates, in parallel mesocosm in the northern site during
the first year, and in the southern site during the next year.
The mesocosms will be run for the period from March to June/July.
The H</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>o</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hypothesis will
thus be that there is no differences in growth pattern, developmental
and mortality schedules among the two geographical distinct populations
of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Cylindric mesocosms (50 m</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>)
arranged around a platform nearby K&aring;rvika Research Station
in Troms&oslash;, will be filled with FSW, and stocked with <I>Calanus
</I>eggs, and a composite natural phytoplankton community, generated
from spores in sediment samples form the area. After Day 30 additional
stocks of flagellates will be added in order ensure a high quality
diet for the intensive growth period during the copepodite stages
(see Berggreen et al. 1988; Hansen et al. 1994). Light conditions
in the mesocosms will be set equal to 10 m of depth by maintaining
a light filtering net on to of each mesocosm. The food conditions,
temperature and salinity will be monitored daily. Parameters like
temperature, chlorophyll, particulare organic carbon (Infra Red
Gas Analyser), C/N, species composition of phytoplankton and microzooplankton
will be monitored weekly. Copepod samples will be obtained weekly
by a plankton net (100 and 180 </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Symbol">m</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>m

differentiation, signs of diapause entry and the degree of moulting
success to a second generation will be studied by gonad examination
of the cohorts under study.<BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Scientific rationale</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>:
To understand life cycle strategy and estimate production of copepods,
we must know the common characteristics of growth and development
for the individuals of the same population and the sources of
their variability. Models coupling the physiological approach
with stage structure and mortality as developed by Carlotti &amp;
Sciandra (1989) enable the dynamics of all the developmental stages,
in variable conditions of food and temperature, to be simulated.
Despite numerous experiments on the physiological processes of
copepods (ingestion, metabolism, growth) and on cohort development,
the links between growth (biomass increase) and development (stage
progression) are not fully understood (TASC Report). The experimental
work proposed in the previous two subtasks will provide an opportunity,
using the data generated, to address the outstanding question
of model calibration. Modelling will also be a synthetic tool
testing hypotheses on <I>Calanus </I>population dynamics resulting
from the laboratory, mesocosm and field studies.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>To develop a life cycle model compatible with the
computational demands of operation in tandem with a particle tracking
dispersal model, an alternative approach is also necessary. Deterministic
and stochastic models to predict the optimal seasonal time for
entry and exit of diapause in species which can only overwinter
in diapause have been available for some time. These tend to be
parameter rich. Gurney et al. (1992) explored the use of circle-map
models, a method used in mechanics modelling, to investigate population
synchrony for species with seasonal diapause. The models are parameter
sparse, and function by tracking generation lines, predicting
successive spawning times in relation to the periodicity of the
forcing environmental signal - precisely the approach required
to simulate reproduction in a particle tracking system. This method
has shown that for insect taxa the size and timing of entry to
diapause is critical for population persistence under seasonally
adverse conditions, whilst wide flexibility in the size and time
of diapause entry and exit is a feature allowing colonisation
of a wide latitudinal range. For example, tropical insect species
which succeed in colonising temperate environments. In <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
the diapause stage is relatively extended in the open ocean (3-5
months). In insects this commonly results in high degree of population
synchrony. The use of circle-map models seems appropriate for
investigate this life-cycle aspect.<BR>
