<h1>History of Alcohol Prohibition*</h1>

<p><b>*This section is based in large part on a paper prepared
for the Commission by Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney from
Washington, D.C. <br>
</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1920, the national policy of Prohibition began. The 18th
Amendment to the Constitution had been officially ratified:<br>
</p>

<p><i>It sought, by law, to make the whole Nation into enforced
teetotalers and to put an end to all evils associated with
drinking. It sought to eradicate a taste deeply rooted in the
habits and customs of a large part of the population through
outlawing the business that ministered to its satisfaction</i>
(Hu, 1950: 48).<br>
</p>

<p><b>1650-1750: THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS<br>
</b></p>

<p>In fact, it started earlier. &quot;Ministers shall not give
themselves to excess in drinkinge, or riott, or spending their
tyme idellye day or night,&quot; ruled the Virginia Colonial
Assembly in 1629 (Cherrington, 1920:16). </p>

<p>Massachusetts ordered that no person shall remain in any
tavern &quot;longer than necessary occasions&quot; in 1637, while
Plymouth Colony in 1633 prohibited the sale of spirits &quot;more
than 2 pence worth to anyone but strangers just arrived&quot;
(Cherrington, 1920: 18). </p>

<p>This sampling of the earliest colonial laws is representative
of the attempt, continued since those times, to control excessive
consumption. Excessive drinking, it was considered, produced
behavior unseemly in some, such as ministers, and dangerous in
others, such as Indians. </p>

<p>But drinking per se was not frowned upon. Indeed, when the
Puritans set sail to Massachusetts, they had taken care to carry
with them 42 tons of beer (in contrast with 14 tons of water) and
10,000 gallons of wine (Lee, 1963: 15). </p>

<p>The regulation of liquor consumption was a matter of
considerable concern in certain colonies. Thus, for a time,
Massachusetts went so far as to prohibit the drinking of healths
in 1638 (Lee, 1963: 19). The law was soon abandoned for reasons
obvious, albeit unrecorded. It rapidly became clear, however,
that liquor laws could do more and perhaps better, than control
consumption: they could provide a source of revenue. By the turn
of the 18th century, the regulatory impulse was concentrated on
fines, excise taxes and license fees. </p>

<p>Fines were imposed for drunken behavior, unlawful sales to a
drunken tippler or to Indians, and for selling without a license.
Court records indicate that these laws were enforced with
reasonable regularity (Krout 1967: 29-30). Licenses often carried
their own fees, and excise taxes were levied upon distilled
spirits as well as beer and fermented drink in many cases. </p>

<p>Until the 18th century, however, there was no attempt to
prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale, or consumption of
alcoholic beverages. Quite the contrary, at least one
individual-in some cases a reluctant individual-was required in
many towns to run the local inn or public house for visitors and
travelers. </p>

<p>Although colonial statutes made it clear that tipplers and
idlers were unwelcome, the diary of a colonial traveler, Sarah
Kemble Knight, suggests that such laws were unsuccessful in
containing the ribaldry which took place in many such houses.
Madam Knight complained:<br>
</p>

<p><i>I could get no sleep, because of the Clamor of some of the
Town Tope-ers in the next room.... I heartily fretted &amp;
wish't 'am tongue tyed.... They kept calling for Tother Gill, Wch
while they were swallowing, was some Intermission, But presently,
like Oyle to fire, encreased the flame </i>(Miller, Johnson,
eds., 1963: 430-431).<br>
</p>

<p>Persons other than Madam Knight were to become more outspoken
about their concern for the use of spirits. The, most significant
premonition was the Colony of Georgia's action in 1735 when the
first prohibitory statute against the importation of &quot;ardent
spirits&quot; was enacted. At the same time, however, the
consumption of beer was encouraged (Grant, 1932: 1). The time for
temperance had not yet arrived.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1750-1825: TEMPERANCE STIRRINGS<br>
</b></p>

<p>As the evils of intemperance began to attract the attention of
the ministry, John Wesley denounced the sin of distilling -and
declared for its Prohibition in 1773 (Cherrington, 1920: 37-38). </p>

<p>On his heels came the publication of a pamphlet entitled
&quot;The Mighty Destroyer Displayed and Some Account of the
Dreadful Havoc Made by the Mistaken Use, As Well As the Abuse, of
Distilled Spiritous Liquors,&quot; by Anthony Benezet, a member
of the Society of Friends, advising against the use of any drink
&quot;which is liable to steal away a man's senses and render him
foolish, irrascible, uncontrollable, and dangerous&quot;
(Cherrington, 1920: 38). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, typical of the century's ambivalence, the first
master at Harvard was fired when it was found that Harvard
students had been left &quot;wanting beer betwixt brewings a week
and a week and a half together&quot; (Lee, 1963: 16). </p>

<p>Concern for the effect of liquor upon the public weal was
expressed by John Adams who noted in his diary on February 29,
1760, that the taverns were &quot;becoming the eternal haunt of
loose, disorderly people . . .&quot; (Cherrington, 1920: 37).
Worst of all he continued: <br>
</p>

<p><i>... These houses are become the nurseries of our
legislators. An artful man, who has neither sense nor sentiments,
may, by gaining a little sway among the rabble of the town,
multiply taverns and dram shops and thereby secure the votes of
taverner and retailer and of all; and the multiplication of
taverns will make many, who may be induced to flip and rum, to
vote for any man whatever </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 215).<br>
</p>

<p>The health argument in behalf of temperance was first made by
Nathaniel Ames, in the 1752 edition of his Almanack, who wrote
that </p>

<p><i>Strong Waters were formerly used only by the Direction of
Physicians; but now Mechanicks and low-li'd Labourers drink Rum
like Fountain-Water, and they can infinitely better endure it
than the idle. unactive and sedentary Part of Mankind, but DEATH
is in the bottom of the cup of every one </i>(Lee, 1963: 22).<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Rush shared his concern, publishing in 1785 his
now famous &quot;Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon
the Human Body and Mind.&quot; Enumerating the diseases of the
body and mind which plague the drinker of distilled liquors, Dr.
Rush outlined the symptoms, including &quot;unusual garrulity,
unusual silence, captiousness ... an insipid simpering ...
profane swearing ... certain immodest actions&quot; and
&quot;certain extravagant acts which indicate a temporary fit of
madness&quot; (Rush, 1943: 323, 325-326). </p>

<p>Although the rumblings of the temperance movement were thus
perceptible in the late 18th century, there is no evidence that
its effects were felt. In 1766, it is recorded that the repeal of
the Stamp Act was greeted in Providence, Rhode Island with
&quot;32 of the most loyal, patriotic and constitutional
toasts&quot; (Lee, 1963: 18). Notwithstanding this evidence of
devotion to His Majesty. it was often thereafter the tavern which
provided the meeting places for the most defiant revolutionaries.
</p>

<p>Subsequently, when the colonial period disappeared into the
post-Revolutionary era, Alexander Hamilton adopted the idea
earlier effected by the individual colonies, to tax distilled
liquors for revenue purposes. In 1791 , the tax was enacted as
part of the Revenue Act. The following year, the Second Congress
of the United States added license fees for distilleries and
taxes on liquors distilled from imported materials. </p>

<p>Incensed by this federal action, farmers in Western
Pennsylvania mobbed revenue collectors and armed to resist this
intrusion by the new Federal Government. It required 15,000
militia to bring the so-called Whiskey Rebellion to an end
(Peterson, 1969: 119-120). Such was the first indication that the
liquor industry in the United States would be a force with which
the government would have to reckon. </p>

<p>Toward the end of the 18th century, a temperance movement, as
such, became discernible. The Methodist Church took a staunch
position against the sale or imbibing of ardent spirits
&quot;unless in cases of extreme necessity.&quot; Five years
later, in 1789, even the exception was excised (Cherrington,
1920: 50). A similar platform was adopted by the Presbyterian
Synod of Pennsylvania and by the Yearly Meeting of Friends of New
England (Cherrington, 1920: 51, 58). </p>

<p>On a non-clerical level, the movement began to organize.
Although there is some dispute as to the identity of the original
temperance society, it appears that as early as 1778, there was
an organization calling itself the Free African Society which
excluded men of drinking habits, followed soon thereafter by the
Organization of Brethren, and the Litchfield, Connecticut
Association of &quot;the most respectable farmers&quot; in
Connecticut determined to discourage the use of spirits
(Cherrington, 1920: 49, 58). </p>

<p>The turn of the century saw the vitalization of the temperance
spirit. Religious leaders, including Cotton Mather, Dr. Lyman
Beecher, John Wesley and Reverend Andrew Elliott inveighed
against the consumption of liquors. Temperance activity figured
prominently in the concerns of the Presbyterian, Methodist,
Universalist, Baptist, and Friends churches. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Had. the temperance reform in America awaited for a
non-church or a non-Christian leadership,&quot;</i> theorizes one
historian, </p>

<p><i>... the temperance revolution of the past century would yet
remain to be accomplished.... Every successful temperance
movement of the last century has been merely the instrument-the
machinery and equipment through which the fundamental principles
of the Christian religion have expressed themselves in terms of
life and action</i> (Cherrington, 1920:92).<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the Christian input , however, it is also apparent
that a desire to reform was aroused in the country, very much
like that which was to be experienced a century later during the
Progressive Movement. Thus, Massachusetts Society for the
Suppression of Intemperance of 1813, damned not only rum, but all
of the &quot;kindred vices, profaneness and gambling&quot; and
beseeched members to &quot;discourage... by ... example and
influence, every kind of..... immorality&quot; (Lee, 1963: 23).
Mingling with the potential temperance leaders during this period
were the future spokesmen of abolitionism, feminism, and
utopianism. </p>

<p>In the meantime, the industry was able to report triumphantly
that the federal taxes on distilling and importing spirits were
repealed in 1802. From 1813 until 1817, the retailers' and
distillers' licenses bore a federal tax, but beginning in 1818
the industry enjoyed a tax-free era which was to last until 1862.
Thomas Jefferson rejoiced-&quot;as a moralist&quot;-explaining
that: </p>

<p><i>It is an error to view a tax on that liquor as merely a tax
on the rich. It is a prohibition of its use in the middling class
of our citizens, and a condemnation of them to the poison of
whisky, which is desolating their houses. No nation is drunken
where wine is cheap; and none sober, where the only antidote is
the bane of whisky </i>(Peterson, 1969: 122-123).<br>
</p>

<p>Future prohibitionists would likewise castigate the government
for drawing its revenues from the liquor industry and
participating in the profits of evil thereby.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1825-1870: THE PLEDGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Temperance was not always equated with teetotalism. Beer and
usually wine were initially exempt from denunciation in both
sermons and treatises. There developed in the mid-19th century,
however, the conviction that all brews, be they &quot;ardent
spirits,&quot; beer, ale, or wine, were anathema. </p>

<p>The, new temper of the movement was epitomized by the travels
of Father Theobald Matthew of Ireland who toured the United
States from 1849 to 1851, administering the pledge of total
abstinence to some 600,000 persons in 25 states. A White House
dinner and a Senate reception stamped official approval upon his
sojourns (Furnas, 1968: 80). Thus did temperance drift into a new
phase, with its ardent spokesman, Congressman Gerrit Smith,
crying that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>I would that no person were able to drink intoxicating
liquors without immediately becoming a drunkard. For, who, then
would . . . drink the poison that always kills, or jump into the
fire that always burns?</i> (Furnas, 1968: 15).<br>
</p>

<p>It was in this atmosphere that the first prohibition
experiments were undertaken on a statewide basis. &quot;Until the
liquor traffic is abolished . . . all efforts at moral reform
must languish,&quot; judged one of the earliest prohibitionists. </p>

<p>In &quot;Grappling with the Monster,&quot; T. S. Arthur
stated, &quot;The CURSE is upon us, and there is but one CURE:
Total Abstinence, by the help of God, for the Individual, and
Prohibition for the State&quot; (Furnas, 1968: 15). </p>

<p>In 1847, the first such cure was enacted for the state of
Maine (Cherrington, 1920: 134). (Actually, the first Prohibition
law went into effect in 1843 in the territory of Oregon. This was
repealed five years later.) </p>

<p>A wave of prohibition statutes followed. Delaware, on the
heels of Maine, passed its first prohibition law only to have it
declared unconstitutional the following year. Similar laws were
enacted in Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York during the
next few years. They met with varying fates, including veto by
the governors, repeal by the legislatures and invalidation by the
state supreme courts. </p>

<p>The evaluations by several historians of these early trials
were to he heard again in the 20th century: the enactments lacked
support from a large portion of the population, making
enforcement exceedingly difficult. Ultimately, all but one of the
states repealed the prohibition statutes of the 19th century
(Grant, 1932: 5; Peterson, 1969: 123). </p>

<p>Notwithstanding this record, prohibitionists took heart.
&quot;This thing is of God,&quot; cried Lyman Beecher from the
pulpit. &quot;That glorious Maine law was a square and grand blow
right between the horns of the Devil&quot; (Furnas, 1968: 167).
Temperance societies, established in all but three states by 1832
and destined to proliferate, began to consolidate as well. </p>

<p>The American Temperance Society, later to become the American
Temperance Union, was organized in 1826. It quickly begat
auxiliaries, so that by 1835, 8,000 locals existed (Cherrington,
1920: 92-93). </p>

<p>As the years passed, they witnessed the founding of more
temperance, organizations of a general and national character
than during any other period in the United States' history. The
Washingtonian movement, organized in the City of Baltimore in
1840, was followed by the Martha Washington movement in 1841. </p>

<p>The Sons of Temperance came into existence in 1842, at, the
same time the Order of Rechabites was organized, and the
Congressional Temperance Society of 1833 was revived on the basis
of total abstinence. They took heart at their early state,
successes and fought against the defeats of repeal. </p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the United States government, which
had heaped honors upon Father Matthew, concluded a treaty with
King Kamehameha III of Hawaii in 1850 permitting the introduction
and sale of liquor on his island. </p>

<p>As further evidence of the national dichotomy, Chicagoans in
the 1850's fought virulently against the enforcement of Sunday
closing laws. To protest, an armed mob burst into the business
district of the city, to be met by police. Fortunately, the mob
was dispersed before the mayor found it necessary to use the
cannon he had hurriedly planted around City Hall (Peterson, 1969:
120). </p>

<p>It was the time when patent medicines, 40 proof and more,
began to develop their clientele. And although the Demon Rum
might threaten their health and life, Lydia Pinkham's Compound
offered a cure for any and all ails and aches. </p>

<p>By the time of the Civil War, both the assimilative and
coercive traditions of the temperance movement had crystallized:
that is, temperance proponents were determined to save the weak
and to destroy the recalcitrant (Gusfield, 1963: 69-70). The
hardening of positions was accompanied by the development of
political consciousness in the movement and recognition of
political objectives. These processes were only temporarily
blunted by the Civil War in the 1860's and the diversion of
interest to the abolitionist cause. </p>

<p>Part of the heritage of the Civil War was the tax on liquor
and beer imposed in 1862. Rates were increased several times
between 1863 and 1868, so that the tax imposed at the rate of 20
cents per gallon rose to $2 per gallon. </p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon was noted by the Federal Government:
as the rates increased, the revenue did not. In fact, the number
of gallons reported actually declined. As the decade went on,
attempts were made to enforce the tax laws and in 1868, $25,000
was actually appropriated to detect violators. Fraud continued
almost unabated. Stockpiling of liquor was popular to hedge
against future, increases, for they were not applicable to liquor
on hand. </p>

<p>The infamous Whiskey Ring was active in these days and was not
finally broken up until 1875, when, in a peak of nerve, members
established a corruption fund in the District of Columbia to halt
the prosecution of 321 persons charged with violations of the
revenue laws. Before then, however, Congress apparently had
second thoughts about the implications of the revenue collections
and reduced the tax from the high of $2 per gallon to 50 cents in
1869. The happy result was to see a rise in collections from
$13.5 million in 1868, to $45 million in 1869, and $55 million
the following year. Taking further precautions, the government
stipulated that new stamps be developed to preclude
counterfeiting and tampering (History of the Alcohol 14-20;
Cherrington, 1920: 156162). </p>

<p>Congress did not escape unscathed by criticism and reaction.
It came from both sides of the temperance issue. Temperance
advocates such as Senator Wilson of Massachusetts and Senator
Pomeroy of Kansas decried the fact that federal revenues would be
drawn from the liquor industry. </p>

<p>At the same, time, however, the industry revolted, leading to
mass tax evasion schemes and devices and the organization of
their first industry lobby, the United States Brewers
Association. The Association rapidly launched a, legislative
campaign and succeeded in 1863 in reducing the tax rate of beer
from $1 to 60 cents (Cherrington, 1920:157). </p>

<p>By 1870, the Civil War dust had cleared and the temperance
battle lines were drawn, already tested by the skirmishes of the
1840's and 1850's. The most interesting feature of their war
strategy was soon to become apparent: women and children were
welcomed at the battlements.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1870-1913: TOWARD A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE </b></p>

<p>A series of &quot;isms&quot; was aroused in this era:
feminism, unionism, socialism, and progressivism. Prohibition
absorbed elements of them all, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The feminist movement originated early in the 1800's. Until
the 1870's, however, feminine involvement in the temperance
effort was largely peripheral. The Women's Crusade of 1873 and
the organization of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in
1874 marked the formal entrance of women into the temperance
movement.<br>
</p>

<p>The WCTU was devotedly headed by Frances E. Willard, a lady
equally committed to the principle of equality of the sexes.
Temperance was to bridge the gap, she believed:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Drink and tobacco are the great separatists [sic] between
men and women. Once they used these things together, but woman's
evolution has carried her beyond them; man will climb to the same
level . . . but meanwhile ... the fact that he permits himself
fleshly indulgence that he would deprecate in her, makes their
planes different, giving her an instinct of revulsion </i>(Furnas,
1968: 281).<br>
</p>

<p>Although the WCTU was organized initially around the
temperance issue, it was not long before Miss Willard's
leadership expanded its conscience. </p>

<p>A statement of principles was adopted in its early years: </p>

<p><i>We believe in a living wage; in an 8-hour day; in courts of
conciliation and arbitration, in justice as opposed to greed in
gain; in &quot;Peace on Earth and Good Will to Men&quot;</i>
(Gusfield, 1963: 76).<br>
</p>

<p>Within three years of its inception, the WCTU reported that
its concerns included &quot;a better Indian policy&quot; and
&quot;wiser civil service reform&quot; (Gusfield, 1963: 77).
There were those in the Union who felt that their interests
should be limited to temperance. But, forecasting the mood of
Progressivism, Miss Willard steered the organization along the
broader lines to social reform. </p>

<p>The WCTU was responsible for part of the early campaign to
educate the public about temperance. Children were recruited to
sing praises of &quot;the true and the brave&quot; who signed the
abstinence pledge. They were assisted in this effort by
McGuffey's Readers which denounced the licensing of liquor stores
and saloons:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Licensed-to do thy neighbor harm,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to kindle hire and strife,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to nerve the robber's arm,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to whet the murderer's knife,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-like spider for a fly,</i> </p>

<p><i>To spread thy nets for man, thy prey,</i> </p>

<p><i>To mock his struggles, crush his soul,</i> </p>

<p><i>Then cast his worthless form away </i>(Lee, 1963: 34-35).<br>
</p>

<p>Whiskey makes &quot;the happy miserable&quot; and impoverishes
the rich, the, McGuffey books concluded. And the word spread. By
1902, the temperance campaign had permeated the public school
systems: every state but Arizona had introduced compulsory
temperance education. Their texts teemed with both facts and
misinformation such as &quot;Alcohol sometimes causes the coats
of the blood vessels to grow thin. They are then liable at any
time to cause death by bursting.&quot; (Sinclair, 1962: 43). </p>

<p>The WCTU was not carrying the burden of reform alone, however.
In 1869, the National Prohibition Party was born. Three years
later, the first party ticket was put forth in the presidential
campaign of 1872, headed by John Black, who received 5,607 votes
for President. Success at the polls ultimately peaked in 1892
when John Dedwell, the Prohibition presidential candidate,
received a total of 270,710 votes. Thereafter, its partisans
declined in number, having failed to break voters away from their
traditional affiliations (Cherrington, 1920: 165-169). </p>

<p>As a rule, the WCTU eschewed partisanship. Their objectives
were far broader and more practical than those contemplated by
the Prohibition Party. Only once it supported the Prohibition
Party in the notorious election of 1884. </p>

<p>The election of 1884 carried a variety of implications for
future candidates on the temperance issue. In New York City
alone, 1,007 primaries and conventions reportedly were held by
the various parties. Of these, over 60% took place in saloons
(Peterson, 1969: 123), recalling to mind the complaint of John
Adams a century before (Cherrington, 1920: 37; Dobyns, 1940:
215). The meeting places were indicative of the fact that at this
time neither party could afford to adopt a dry plank in its
platform, for New York would be a pivotal state in the race
between Republican James G. Blaine and Democrat Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p>Blaine campaigned hard, trying to overcome the defection of
several thousand dry Republicans to the Prohibition Party.
Speaking in behalf of Blaine at a New York City rally,
Presbyterian minister Samuel Burchard denounced the Democrats as
the party of &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.&quot; Needless
to say, the Catholic vote, as well as the wet vote, quickly
swelled the Democratic totals. Blaine, having thus alienated both
wets and drys, lost the state--and the election-by a tiny margin
(Furnas, 1968: 273; Lee, 1963: 29-30). </p>

<p>In case the lesson that temperance was an issue to be reckoned
with in national politics was lost on the parties after 1884, the
events of the decade culminating in the birth of the Anti-Saloon
League in 1895, dramatized the point. A second wave of state
prohibition laws was experienced between 1880 and 1890. The
results of much of the legislation during those years were less
than satisfying to temperance advocates, however; only six states
emerged with state-wide prohibition by statute or constitutional
amendment. Numerous other states had enacted local option, which
permitted towns to go dry if they so chose by referendum. Without
state or federal insulation from wet communities, however, the
so-called dry towns were scarcely temperance models. </p>

<p>In the wake of these state legislative actions, South Carolina
introduced a state dispensary system in order to eliminate the
motive of private gain from the liquor business. Political
scandals which quickly developed tended to discredit it, however,
if indeed it had enjoyed much support from any corner
(Cherrington, 1920: 250-251). </p>

<p>With this discomfiting history behind it, the Anti-Saloon
League arose to the challenge, while Carrie Nation independently
thrust her way into the public eye. The League was to develop the
art of lobbying or &quot;pressure political&quot; to its most
dramatic heights. Scarcely more than 10 years after organization,
it was described as &quot;the most dangerous political movement
that this country has ever known&quot; by the National Model
License League, a wet (and harassed) association. A more rational
viewpoint was expressed by the president of the New York State
Brewers Association in 1913: </p>

<p><i>We are not dealing with a theory which is the delusion of
the fanatic alone, but with a real condition which is in the
hands of a well organized force, led by aggressive, experienced,
and untiring leaders </i>(Odegard, 1928: 23).<br>
</p>

<p>The focus of the League's indictments included not simply
alcohol, but the saloon itself, as the purveyor of spirits. The
myriad League publications denounced the saloon for <i>&quot;annually
sending thousands of our youths to destruction, for corrupting
politics, dissipating workmen's wages, leading astray 60,000
girls each year into lives of immorality and banishing children
from school&quot;</i> (Odegard, 1928: 40-59). </p>

<p><i>&quot;Liquor is responsible for 19% of the divorces, 25% of
the poverty, 25% of the insanity, 37% of the pauperism, 45% of
child desertion, and 50% of the crime in this country,&quot;</i>
the League determined. <i>&quot;And this,&quot;</i> it concluded
, <i>&quot; is a very conservative estimate&quot;</i> (Odegard,
1928: 60). </p>

<p>League posters appeared everywhere depicting the saloon-keeper
as a profiteer who feasted on death and enslavement. Others
screamed out the dire consequences of alcohol. &quot;Alcohol
inflames the passions, thus making the temptation to sex-sin
unusually strong,&quot; advertised one (Sinclair, 1962: 51). </p>

<p>It was the League which geared up the campaign, but it was not
alone. As the Progressive spirit caught the national interest in
the early 19th century, the movement for reform embraced the
cause of temperance. The temperance movement assumed an aura of
evangelism, combining the concept of America's mission with the
vision of Messianism. Through the combination of temperance and
progressivism, it was believed that the Kingdom of God could
actually come to the United States.<br>
</p>

<p>In an article in Appleton's Magazine in 1908, the Reverend
Charles F. Aked articulated the aspirations of the reformers: </p>

<p><i>We are spending our lives, many of us, in the effort to
make the world a little better and brighter for those that shall
come after us.... we want to open out life and liberty to all the
sons of men. We want to make possible for all of life in the
whole, the good and the beautiful ... and the common sale of
intoxicating liquor renders our work a thousand times more
difficult ... </i>(Timberlake, 1063: 34-38).<br>
</p>

<p>Others were more mundane. Scientists began accumulating
evidence of the effect of quantities of alcohol on the nervous
system and general physical condition. The myth that alcohol
consumption improved muscular power was exploded. The
relationship between mental psychoses and alcohol was documented,
and thus did the condemnation of alcohol as a poison assume
scientific support. Finally, in 1915, whiskey and brandy were
discreetly removed from the list of authoritative medicinal drugs
contained in the United States Pharmacopoeia (Timberlake, 1963:
47). </p>

<p>Who were the people fueling the movement? Largely middle
class, rural, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant comprised the temperance
movement and they confronted the urban and industrial communities
head-on. &quot;The Anglo-Saxon stock is the best improved,
hardiest and fittest.... [I]f we are to preserve this nation and
the Anglo-Saxon type we must abolish [saloons],&quot; proclaimed
one temperance publication (Gusfield, 1963: 100). Calling itself
&quot;The Protestant church in action&quot; (Sinclair, 1962:
108), the Anti-Saloon League concentrated single-mindedly and
evangelically on the cause of temperance and refrained from
dabbling in other reforms (Gusfield, 1963: 108). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Episcopal and Lutheran churches never
aligned themselves with the AntiSaloon League, while Jewish and
Catholic groups generally opposed their objective. The conviction
shared by Anti-Saloon Leaguers expressed by Reverend Francis
Ascott McBride was: &quot;The League was born of God&quot; (Lee,
1963: 35). Thus one had to be for or against the movement; there
was no half-way commitment. </p>

<p>When the sides were lined up initially, industrialists and
union leaders alike preferred to keep God on their side. From the
company's point of view, the saloon was often responsible for
industrial injuries and absenteeism. Some believed that the
drinking man demanded higher wages than his sober counterparts.
Furthermore, union locals tended to congregate in saloon meeting
halls maintained for that purpose and, it was sometimes
suspected, for the plottings of anarchistic conspirators (Furnas,
1968: 310). </p>

<p>Accordingly, it was not long before industry moved from an
acquiescent position to an active role in the temperance
movement. Various methods were adopted to encourage sobriety,
including lectures, literature and job preferences for
teetotalers. Businessmen opined that sobriety expanded
productivity, increased bank deposits, improved collections and
stimulated the retail trade (Timberlake, 1963: 67-79). </p>

<p>At the same time, the prospect of diverting patronage of the
liquor industry to other products tantalized some industries.
Thus the Welch Grape Juice Company advertised:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Get the Welch Habit-It's one that won't get you!</i>
(Timberlake, 1963: 77).<br>
</p>

<p>Opinion was not unanimous, of course. Businessmen, including
bankers, whose interests were tied to the liquor industry could
ill afford to be beneficent toward temperance. Others, including
the DuPonts, Rockefellers, Kresges, and Wanamakers spent freely
to cover the League's annual campaign costs of $2.5 million
(Odegard, 1928: 126). </p>

<p>As surely as liquor was the enemy of the home, it was also
proclaimed the enemy of the working man. &quot;The great sinkhole
for the workers' wages is the saloon,&quot; wrote the editors of
one League publication, The California Liberator. &quot;When that
abomination is destroyed, labor is freed from its greatest
curse&quot; (Odegard, 1928: 53). The logic appealed to the union
leadership. According to one official of the American Federation
of Labor: <br>
</p>

<p><i>No force in our country has been as effective in the
promotion of temperance among working people as the organized
labor movement. The labor movement has achieved more for the
cause of temperance than all the temperance societies combined
... </i>(Timberlake, 1963: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>Since similar credit has been claimed for the League, the
Protestant church, and business interests, it is difficult to
apportion the plaudits. Subsequent events suggest that the labor
interests failed to live up to this claim, however. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding Terrence V. Powerderly's early speech against
&quot;the strong right hand of labor itself . . . that carries
with it the rum which drowns reason,&quot; his own Knights of
Labor repealed their constitutional provision which denied
membership to anyone connected with the liquor trade (Timberlake,
1963: 85-86). </p>

<p>As the reports of the National Commission on Enforcement of
the Prohibition Laws (known as the &quot;Wickersham
Commission&quot;) were later to record, it was particularly the
workers who resented the paternal legislation which they believed
was directed at them and their habits (National Commission on Law
Observance, 1931: 345). </p>

<p>In addition, there were. those whose livelihoods would be
directly affected-indeed, effaced-by the success of the campaign:
brewery workers, bartenders, glass workers, waiters, and
musicians among others.<br>
</p>

<p>Thus, even though the Socialist Party resolved in 1908 that <i>&quot;any
excessive indulgence in intoxicating liquors by members of the
working class is a serious obstacle to the triumph of our cause
since it impairs the vigor of the fighters in political and
economic struggle&quot; </i>(Timberlake, 1963: 98), the
industrial urban centers of the country continued to harbor and
stimulate antagonism towards the temperance movement.<br>
</p>

<p>The identification of the saloon and its offerings with the
urban, immigrant working class further enraged Prohibitionists.
As one sociologist observed, &quot;The saloon appeared as the
symbol of a culture which was alien to the ascetic character of
American values . . .&quot; (Gusfield, 1963: 100). Thus,
Americanism became a central issue in the temperance movement. </p>

<p>One temperance spokesman, cited in Barker's &quot;The Saloon
Problem,&quot; vented these sentiments:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The influx of foreigners into our urban centers, many of
whom have liquor habits [sic], is a menace to good government. .
. . [T] he foreign born population is largely under the social
and political control of the saloon. If the cities keep up their
rapid growth they will soon have the balance of political power
in the nation and become storm centers of political life </i>(Timberlake,
1963: 118).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1913-1933: NATIONAL PROHIBITION -- PROLOGUE AND FINISH<br>
</b></p>

<p>The distrust of the immigrant population became more
pronounced as the economic, political, and social power of the
cities developed. It was given a strong impetus by the
anti-German tremors which shook the country in a mood of
anticipation before World War 1. </p>

<p>The United States Brewers Association misread the prevailing
temper and associated itself with the German-American Alliance to
oppose the temperance advocates and defend German kultur in the
United States. </p>

<p>As the United States came closer to war, the antipathy which
developed against the Central Powers was directed with equal
force against brewers and tipplers (Furnas, 1968: 334-35) :<br>
</p>

<p><i>Pro-Germanism is the only froth from the German's beer
saloon. Our German Socialist Party and the German American
Alliance are the spawn of the saloon. . . . Prohibition is the
infallible submarine chaser </i>(Sinclair, 1962:122).<br>
</p>

<p>The war gave the prohibition cause new ammunition. Literature
depicted brewers and licensed retailers as treacherously stabbing
American soldiers in the back. Raw materials and labor were being
diverted from the war effort to an industry which debilitated the
nation's capacity to defend itself. It was urged that wartime
prohibition would stop the waste of grain and molasses and would
remove a handicap on workers' efficiency. </p>

<p>&quot;Liquor is a menace to patriotism because it puts beer
before country,&quot; preached Prohibitionist Wayne Wheeler
(Odegard, 1928: 72). The fact that names Pabst, Schlitz, and
Blatz broadcast their national origin only did further injury to
their interests. </p>

<p>In this atmosphere the Wartime Prohibition Act was passed in
1918. It followed a series of federal laws such as the Wilson
Original Packages Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act, attempts to
protect dry states from their wet neighbors. </p>

<p>The Wilson Original Packages Act was passed on August 8, 1890,
and provided that all intoxicating beverages shipped interstate
would be subject to the laws of the destination state upon
arrival. No mechanism for federal enforcement was provided. </p>

<p>The Webb-Kenyon Act, enacted March 1, 1913, was intended to
reinforce the 1890 Act by providing that it was a violation of
federal law to ship an intoxicating beverage interstate with the
intent that it be used or sold in any manner in violation of the
laws of the destination state. The lack of federal enforcement
rendered the statute virtually meaningless. </p>

<p>The Reed Amendment, enacted four years later, provided a fine
of $1,000 for transporting liquor into a dry state with no
greater effect. </p>

<p>None of the earlier acts met with substantial success in
curbing the flow of liquor into purportedly dry regions, but they
did mark a change in federal policy. Formerly liquor laws were
designed solely to produce federal revenue; Congress now took
cognizance of the role it could play in the regulation of
consumption. </p>

<p>The role was actually forced upon a reluctant Congress at
first. Indeed, the government had passed up numerous prior
opportunities to involve itself in the temperance movement as
such. The particular part it was to play was forecast by the Sons
of Temperance who, in 1856, declared themselves for national
constitutional prohibition. </p>

<p>Twenty years later, Congressman Henry Blair of New Hampshire
introduced a prohibition amendment to the Constitution for the
first time in Congress. As a senator, he introduced another such
resolution in 1885, along with Senator Preston Plum of Kansas.
After consideration by the Senate Committee on Education, the
bill was reported out favorably and placed on the Senate Calendar
in 1886. Nevertheless, no action resulted (Cherrington, 1920: 317
). </p>

<p>In the meantime, states continued the struggle between the
wets and the drys, with great success for the temperance
advocates. By 1913, nine states were under stateside prohibition.
In 31 other states, local option laws were in effect. By reason
of these and other variants of regulatory schemes, more than 50%
of the United States population was then under prohibition. </p>

<p>The national constitutional campaign was resumed as such in
1913 when the Anti-Saloon League went on record at its 15th
National Convention in favor of immediate prosecution of the
objective of constitutional amendment. </p>

<p>The National Temperance Council, founded at the same time,
coordinated the activities of numerous temperance organizations
with the same object. In 1913, the demands of the League were
formally presented to Congress by the Committee of 1,000. </p>

<p>The measure was then introduced in the House by Congressman
Thompson and in the Senate by Senator Sheppard. The following
year, the first joint resolution failed to secure the necessary
two thirds majority for submitting a constitutional amendment to
the states. A second resolution was submitted in 1915 and
favorably considered by the Judiciary Committees of both houses,
but neither ever came to a vote. </p>

<p>Ultimately, in 1917, the resolution to prohibit the
manufacture, sale, transportation or importation of alcoholic
beverages in the United States was approved by Congress and sent
to the states for ratification (Cherrington, 1920: 317-330). </p>

<p>It took only one year and eight days for the 18th Amendment to
secure the necessary ratification. On January 8, 1918,
Mississippi proudly became the first state to ratify, and on
January 16, 1919, Nebraska completed the job as the 36th state
(Lee, 1963: 42). By the end of February 1919, there remained only
three hold-outs: New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island
(Cherrington, 1920: 330). </p>

<p>October 28, 1919, was the day that Congress enacted the
National Prohibition Act-more often known as the Volstead
Act-with the intent to give effect to the new constitutional
amendment. Officially, the liquor drought was to begin on January
17, 1920. The celebrants of the occasion were concentrated in the
membership of the Anti-Saloon League, which could rightly claim
that its consummate skill in pressure politics had maneuvered the
country into its dry state. </p>

<p>The early experience of the Prohibition era gave the
government a taste of what was to come. In the three months
before the 18th Amendment became effective, liquor worth half a
million dollars was stolen from Government warehouses. By
midsummer of 1920, federal courts in Chicago were overwhelmed
with some 600 pending liquor violation trials (Sinclair, 1962:
176-177). Within three years, 30 prohibition agents were killed
in service. </p>

<p>Other statistics demonstrated the increasing volume of the
bootleg trade. In 1921, 95,933 illicit distilleries, stills,
still works and fermentors were seized. in 1925, the total jumped
to 172,537 and up to 282,122 in 1930. In connection with these
seizures, 34,175 persons were arrested in 1921; by 1925, the
number had risen to 62,747 and to a high in 1928 of 75,307
(Internal Revenue, Service, 1921, 1966, 1970: 95, 6, 73).
Concurrently, convictions for liquor offenses in federal courts
rose from 35,000 in 1923 to 61,383 in 1932. </p>

<p>The law could not quell the continuing demand for alcoholic
products. Thus, where legal enterprises could no longer supply
the demand, an illicit traffic developed, from the point of
manufacture to consumption. The institution of the speakeasy
replaced the institution of the saloon. Estimates of the number
of speakeasies throughout the United States ranged from 200,000
to 500,000 (Lee, 1963: 68). </p>

<p>Writers of this period point out that the law was circumvented
by various means. Although there may have been legitimate,
medicinal purposes for whiskey, the practice of obtaining a
medical prescription for the illegal substance was abused. It is
estimated that doctors earned $40 million in 1928 by writing
prescriptions for whiskey. </p>

<p>The legal system was equally evasive; the courts convicted
about seven percent of those charged with liquor violations
(Sinclair, 1962: 193-195; Dobyns, 1940: 292). The exception for
sacramental wine from protection under the Volstead Act also
invited abuse. In 1925, the Department of Research and Education
of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ reported that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The withdrawal of wine on permit from bonded warehouses for
sacramental purposes amounted in round figures to 2,139,000
gallons in the fiscal year 1922; 2,503,500 gallons in 1923; and
2,944,700 gallons in 1924. There is no way of knowing what the
legitimate consumption of fermented sacramental wine is but it is
clear that the legitimate demand does not increase 800,000
gallons in two years </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 297).<br>
</p>

<p>The smuggling trade was revived with new vigor and new
incentives. Rum-runners, often under foreign flags, brought
liquor into the country from Belgium and Holland. In 1923, there
were 134 seizures of such vessels. The following year, 236 were
apprehended (History of the Alcohol . . . 928). With fewer risks,
liquor was readily smuggled across the Canadian border. One way
or the other, the Department of Commerce estimated that, as of
1924, liquor valued at approximately $40 million was entering the
United States annually (Sinclair, 1962: 198).<br>
</p>

<p>The manufacture of &quot;near-beer&quot; and industrial
alcohol provided other opportunities for diversion from licit
channels, while the salvage of the California grape industry was
section 29 of the Volstead Act (27 U.S.C. § 46) which authorized
the home production of fermented fruit juices. Although the
section was allegedly inserted to save the vinegar industry and
the hard cider of America's farmers, it was welcomed by home
winemakers as well. In the spirit of cooperation, the grape
growers even produced a type of grape jelly suggestively called
&quot;Vine-go&quot; which, with the addition of water, could make
a strong wine within two months (Sinclair, 1962: 206). </p>

<p>One of the great ironies of the prohibition era was the fact,
noted by the Wickersham Commission, that women happily took to
drink during the experimental decade, and, what is more, did so
in public. As the counterpart of the WCTU, the Women's
Organization for National Prohibition Reform was founded, stating
in its declaration of principles that Prohibition was &quot;wrong
in principle&quot; and <i>&quot;disastrous in consequences in the
hypocrisy, the corruption, the tragic loss of life and the
appalling increase of crime which has attended the abortive
attempt to enforce it&quot; </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 107). </p>

<p>Drinking at an earlier age was also noted, particularly during
the first few years of Prohibition. The superintendents of eight
state mental hospitals reported a larger percentage of young
patients during Prohibition (1919-1926) than formerly. One of the
hospitals noted: &quot;During the past year (1926), an unusually
large group of patients who are of high school age were admitted
for alcoholic psychosis&quot; (Brown, 1932:176). </p>

<p>In determining the age at which an alcoholic forms his
drinking habit, it was noted: &quot;The 1920-1923 group were
younger than the other groups when the drink habit was
formed&quot; (Pollock, 1942: 113).<br>

<p>To be sure, the Volstead Act was enforced in the United States
wherever it had popular support. In the rural South and West
prohibition was effective and in some cases still is. The
failures of prohibition enforcement were spotlighted in the big
cities where the law was flagrantly defied and in the smaller
towns, populated by miners and industrial workers, where the law
was simply ignored (National Commission on Law Observance, 1931:
345). </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the weak enforcement of the Volstead Act, some
believe that it was only the coming of the Depression with its
demand for increased employment and tax revenues which finally
killed the experiment (Gusfield, 1963: 127). Others observe that
Prohibition was a by-product of the stress and excesses of war
and could not have survived in peacetime even under optimal
economic conditions (Sinclair, 1962: 23-24). Finally, there are
those who accuse the selfishly motivated businessmen of the
United States for repeal which they allegedly brought about
through the same high-pressure tactics so successfully employed
by the partisans of temperance in the preceding decades (Dobyns,
1940: 5-130 passim). </p>

<p>Despite mixed motivations, the repeal movement was financed
and driven by the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment
(AAPA). </p>

<p>The members declared that &quot;the principal business and
objective of the Association shall be to educate its members as
to the fundamental provisions, objects and purposes of the
Constitution of the United States&quot; (Dobyns, 1940: 5). They
worked for the election of Congressmen who agreed to submit the
question of repeal to a vote of the people in each state. They
were successful fund-raisers and by January 1, 1931, had almost
$3 million in cash in the bank (Dobyns, 1940: 9). </p>

<p>The sources of the funds included a number of converts from
the dry cause. In 1928, the DuPont family abandoned the drys,
followed in 1932 by John D. Rockefeller and S. S. Kresge
(Gusfield, 1963: 128). Their conversion was effected under the
strong influence of the income tax. Doggedly, Pierre S. DuPont
circulated a brochure concluding that &quot;the British liquor
policy applied in the United States would permit the total
abolition of the income tax both personal and corporate&quot;
(Dobyns, 1940: 22). </p>

<p>Concern for the effects of the prohibition laws was not
limited to the private, wealthy sector. In 1928, a dry-wet
confrontation emerged in the presidential election between Alfred
E. Smith, a Catholic New Yorker, and Herbert Hoover. Hoover
solemnly praised the &quot;great social and economic
experiment&quot; and tightened his grip on the dry vote.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the popular image of Smith as a staunch wet,
his platform tried to avoid any outright repeal sentiment. He
asked instead for an amendment of the Volstead Act which would
provide a &quot;scientific definition of the alcoholic content of
an intoxicating beverage.&quot; This would enable each state to
interpret and apply the federal standard within its borders. In
addition, he favored what was to be known as the &quot;state
store&quot; system of manufacturing and dispensing alcoholic
beverages (Lee, 1963: 212).<br>
</p>

<p>In retrospect, it is difficult to ascertain whether it was the
religious campaign or the dry campaign which defeated Al Smith.
H. L. Mencken may have written accurately that &quot;if [Al
Smith] loses, it will be because those who fear the Pope
outnumber those who are tired of the Anti-Saloon League&quot;
('Sinclair, 1962: 303). Nevertheless, Prohibition survived the
1928 election, as did Hoover's campaign pledge to establish a
commission to investigate the conditions under Prohibition. Head
of the Commission was George W. Wickersham, former Attorney
General under Taft. Although the Commission's purpose was set
forth as an examination of the problems of enforcement, it soon
decided to undertake much broader policy considerations. </p>

<p>The Commission's report, published in 1931, included opinion
surveys, statistics on the number of deaths connected with
enforcement efforts, testimony by consultants and experts, and an
analysis of the organization, personnel and methods of
prohibition enforcement. On the basis of the five volume report,
the Wickersham Commission ironically concluded in its summary
that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There have been more sustained pressures to enforce this
law than on the whole has been true of any other federal statute,
although this pressure in the last four or five years has met
with increasing resistance as the sentiment against prohibition
has developed . . . . That a main source of difficulty is in the
attitude of at least a very large number of respectable citizens
in most of our large cities and in several states, is made more
clear when the enforcement of the national prohibition act is
compared with the enforcement of the laws as to narcotics. There
is an enormous margin of profit in breaking the latter. The means
of detecting transportation are more easily evaded than in the
case of liquor. Yet there are no difficulties in the case of
narcotics beyond those involved in the nature of the traffic
because the laws against them are supported everywhere by a
general and determined public sentiment </i>(Sinclair, 1962:
367-368).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this dire analysis, 10 out of the 11
commissioners signed a summary of conclusions of the report which
stated that the Commission as a whole opposed the repeal of the
18th Amendment, the entry of the Federal or state governments
into liquor business, or even the modification of national
prohibition to permit the sale of light wines and beer (Sinclair,
1962: 364). </p>

<p>Walter Lippmann commented, &quot;What was done was to evade a
direct and explicit official confession that Federal prohibition
is a hopeless failure&quot; (Sinclair, 1962: 365). Whether or not
Lippmann correctly read the Commission's intentions, there was
clearly a gap between the input and the outcome of the report. </p>

<p>It is difficult to assess the relative numbers of the wet and
dry partisans during the last few years of national prohibition.
In terms of strength, however, the wets surely had the edge which
less than two decades before had belonged to the drys. The new
wet strength showed up at the National Convention of the
Democratic party held in Chicago in 1932, where Mayor Cermak of
that city filled the galleries with his supporters. And, though
Franklin D. Roosevelt had wooed the dry vote for some time, he
now came forward on a platform which favored the outright repeal
of the 18th Amendment. Accepting his nomination, he stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>I congratulate this convention for having had the courage,
fearlessly to write into its declaration of principles what an
overwhelming majority here assembled really thinks about the 18th
Amendment. This convention wants repeal. Your candidate wants
repeal. And I am confident that the United States of America
wants repeal </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 160).<br>
</p>

<p>While dry leaders looked on with disgust, Roosevelt was
elected president and Congress turned a somersault. The repeal
amendment was introduced February 14, 1933, by Sen. Blaine of
Wisconsin and approved two days later by the Senate 63 to 23. The
House followed four days later, voting 289 to 121 to send the
amendment on to the States (Lee, 1963: 231). It required approval
by 36 states. Michigan was the first state to ratify it; 39
states voted, on the amendment during 1933, with 37 approving its
ratification and two-North and South Carolina-voting against its
ratification. The final ratification was accomplished on November
7,1933, when Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Utah gave their
approval. </p>

<p>Congress officially adopted the 21st Amendment to the
Constitution on December 5, 1933. </p>

<p>Within three weeks of taking office, President Roosevelt
witnessed the first sales of 3.2 beer, following a redefinition
by statute of the terms &quot;intoxicating liquors.&quot; The
more popular, higher alcohol-content beer was relegalized by
Congress under the Cullen-Harrison Act. Sale of beer became legal
on April 7, 1933, in the District of Columbia and the 20 states
where state laws did not prohibit its sale. During the next four
years the remaining states changed their laws to permit its sale,
with Alabama and Kansas in 1937, as the last to join the legal
sale ranks. <br>
</p>

<p>The job of total repeal was accomplished with the help of the
determined AAPA during the succeeding year. Their lawyers
assisted the states in preparing bills for conventions and
release of various forms of political propaganda, thereby
enacting a serious satire on the 1919 campaign launched by the
Anti-Saloon League. Notwithstanding their high and enduring
constitutional principles, on December 31, 1933, with repeal a
reality, the AAPA ceased to exist and sent its files to the
Library of Congress. &quot;Having attained its objective . . .
the Association resisted the temptation to linger on as a
'sentinel of American liberty' '', the New York Times observed in
the organization's obituary (Dobyns, 1940: 132). <br>

<p><b>PROHIBITION IN PERSPECTIVE</b> </p>

<p>During 13 years, what did Prohibition accomplish? There is no
single compilation of Prohibition statistics which would enable
us to determine the degree of success which Prohibition enjoyed
during its lifetime. </p>

<p>In discussing the relative successes and failures of
Prohibition, most observers conclude that the undertaking failed.
&quot;Prohibition destroyed the manufacturing and distributive
agencies through which the demand for liquor had been legally
supplied. But the demand remained&quot; (Hu, 1950: 51). </p>

<p>In its Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of
the United States, the Wickersham Commission concluded that the
country had prohibition in law but not in fact. They reported:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There was general prevalence of drinking in homes, clubs
and hotels.... Throughout the country people of wealth,
businessmen and professional men and their families, and the
higher paid workingmen and their families, are drinking in large
numbers in open flouting of the law. And neither Congress nor the
states set up adequate machinery or appropriated sufficient funds
for the enforcement of the prohibitory legislation. Federal and
state legislation, as a matter of fact, strove to satisfy so
that, as it was aptly said, the drys had their prohibition law
and the wets had their liquor </i>(Hu, 1950: 52).<br>
</p>

<p>Although some view the theory of prohibition as reasonable, it
is generally conceded that the realities of manufacture and
distribution make it unworkable, for in one form or another,
alcohol can be easily produced by farmers, high school chemistry
students, and ordinary citizens. </p>

<p>Prohibition has been attempted many times in various parts of
the world; except for some Moslem areas, attempted legislative
controls have not proven adequate. In spite of many sincere and
determined efforts, no country in Europe or the Americas has yet
succeeded in eliminating the use of alcohol by society by
legislative fiat (H.E.W., 1968: 41). </p>

<p>Those who had been accustomed to using alcoholic beverages
sought other sources of supply &quot;in disregard of the
legislative mandate. In the presence of high pecuniary returns
there [was] a strong tendency for supply to meet demand in spite
of prohibition&quot; (Hu, 1950: 51). </p>

<p><b>Consumption. </b>Although it is impossible to make an
accurate determination of the consumption of alcoholic beverages
under Prohibition-since there are no statistics compiled
regarding the output and sale of the outlaw industry-estimates
have been made by those examining the economic results of
Prohibition as well as by the Bureau of Prohibition of the U.S.
Department of Justice. The Bureau placed the consumption of
alcoholic beverages at 73,831,172 gallons, or 0.6 gallon per
capita in fiscal year 1930 as contrasted with 166,983,681 gallons
or 1.7 gallons per capita in 1914. </p>

<p>In terms of pure alcohol, the Bureau concluded that per capita
consumption in 1930 was 35% of the 1914 rate of legal
consumption. These estimates have been criticized as being far
too low (Tillitt, 1932: 35). </p>

<p>The figures published by the Department of Commerce in the
Statistical Abstract of the United States reflect a different
picture. The average annual per capita consumption of hard liquor
from 1910-1914, inclusive, was 1.46 proof gallons. &quot;This
5-year period was before the rise of abnormal conditions
coincident to the World War and may be taken as fairly indicative
of the normal rate of drinking that - prevailed in the
Pre-Prohibition 'era&quot; (Rosenbloom, 1935: 51). </p>

<p>The per capita rate for the Prohibition years is computed to
be 1.63 proof gallons. This is 11.64% higher than the
Pre-Prohibition rate (Tillitt, 1932: 35). Based on these figures
one observer concluded: &quot;And so the drinking which was, in
theory, to have been decreased to the vanishing point by
Prohibition has, in fact, increased&quot; (Tillitt, 1932: 36). </p>

<p>Others disagree with the implications of these unverified
statistics noting that persons of limited means, formerly unable
to patronize the expensive speakeasies, once again had cheap
access to alcohol following repeal and thereby increased
consumption (Harrison &amp; Laine, 1936: 1). </p>

<p>Popular opinion is equally inconclusive; a survey conducted by
the American Institute of Public Opinion in 1936 asked whether
conditions (drinking customs, consumption, etc.) were better
worse or without significant change since Repeal 36% indicated a
worsening and 31% could see no appreciable change (Harrison &amp;
Laine, 1936: 2). Perhaps indicative of a gradual process of
adjustment, however, the results of later Gallup polls suggest a
gradual decline in the use of alcohol. Of a national sample, 67%
indicated they used alcohol in 1945, in contrast to 60% in 1950
and 55% in 1958 (Gusfield, 1963: 135).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Alcoholic Psychoses.</b> There was a notable decrease in
alcoholic psychoses and in deaths due to alcoholism immediately
preceding the enactment of Prohibition and a gradual increase in
alcoholic psychosis and in deaths from alcoholism in the general
population since 1920. </p>

<p><i>&quot;These facts appear to indicate that since 1920,
Prohibition [was] increasingly impotent as a means of preventing
excessive use of alcohol to an extent productive of serious
mental disorders and untimely death. 1920 marks the end of the
decline and the beginning of the rise in the trends of alcoholic
mental diseases and of deaths from alcoholism in the general
population&quot;</i> (Brown, 1932: 88). </p>

<p>The increase in mental disorders and deaths from alcoholism
after 1920, however, also coincides with the heavy consumption
period-early 1900's-which would have resulted in an increase in
alcoholism some years later. </p>

<p>The following table reflects the decrease prior to 1920 and
the subsequent gradual increase in percentage of alcoholic
psychosis among new admissions to 56 hospitals in 25 states as
well as among admissions to New York civil state hospitals
(Brown, 1932: 76-77; Malzburg, 1949: 294) :<br>

<p><b>Deaths from Alcoholism.</b> In New York City, from 1900
through 1909, there was an average of 526 deaths annually
attributable to alcoholism. From 1910 through 1917, the average
number was 619. It plummeted to 183 for the years 1918 through
1922. Thereafter, the figure rose, averaging a new high of 639
for the years 1923 through 1927 (Rice, ed., 1930: 122). </p>

<p>Total deaths from alcoholism in the United States show a
comparable trend, with the gradual increase resuming somewhat
earlier, about 1922 (Brown, 1932: 61, 77; Feldman, 1927: 397;

<p>The highest death rates from alcoholism occurred during the
decade prior to Prohibition as did the highest death rates from
cirrhosis of the liver. These statistics should be qualified by
the observations of Dr. Charles Morris, Chief Medical Examiner
for New York City: <i>&quot;In making out death certificates
(which are basic to Census Reports) private or family physicians
commonly avoid entry of alcoholism as a cause of death whenever
possible. This practice was more prevalent under the National Dry
Law than it was in preprohibition time&quot;</i> (Tillitt, 1932:
114-115). </p>

<p>Even if reliable, per se, such statistics may be unrelated to
the consumption of alcoholic beverages in any given year. Another
writer of this period noted: &quot;The relation of fatal
alcoholic diseases to consumption of alcohol must be one
extending over a long period of years and the actual duration of
the critical period can hardly be estimated&quot; (Jellinek,
1942: 48-1). According to one sociologist, rates of alcoholism
and related mental and physical diseases reflect past drinking
habits, developed ten to 15 years earlier (Gusfield, 1963: 119).<br>
</p>

<p>A shorter &quot;lead time&quot; is suggested by a mental
hygiene statistician who attributes the temporary reduction in
alcoholic psychoses &quot;to the legal restriction of the sale
and use of alcoholic beverages, made effective by the support of
public opinion which during the war period had discountenanced
self-indulgence, of all sorts&quot; (Brown, 1932: 88). He adds,
however, that the notable increase in alcoholic psychoses and
deaths from alcoholism towards the end of the prohibition era
(1927-1932) indicated that: </p>

<p><i>... since 1920, prohibition has become increasingly
impotent as a means of preventing excessive use of alcohol to an
extent productive of serious mental disorders and untimely deaths
</i>(Brown, 1932: 88). </p>

<p>The highly limited statistical label of death from alcoholism
has been noted elsewhere:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The trend of death from alcoholism reflects hardly anything
else than progress in the treatment of the so-called diseases of
chronic alcoholism. Nevertheless, statistics of death from
alcoholism have been used by both Drys and Wets to prove that
Prohibition or repeal has greatly improved the rate of death from
alcoholism. . . . Death from alcoholism is simply not an index of
the prevalence of inebriety. Death from alcoholism could fall to
zero in response to medical progress, while at the same time the
rate of inebriety might rise many fold </i>(Jellinek, 1947: 39).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Arrests</b> Arrests for drunkenness also provide a source
of information about the extent of drinking in the United States.
It must be noted, however, that statistics of this sort vary with
local police policies. For example, during a six-year period in
the 1930's, the arrests for drunkenness were from 14 to 31 times
higher in Philadelphia than in New York (Kolb, 1941: 608). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, gross statistics drawn from 383 cities indicate
that arrests for drunkenness per 10,000 population reached a high
of 192 in 1916 and fell to 71 in 1920. From this level, they rose
steadily again to reach 157 in 1928 (Warburton, 1932: 102). Of
course, arrests prior to Prohibition may not bear the same
relation to the use of alcohol as they did subsequently,
Warburton theorizes: <br>
</p>

<p><i>. . . [U]nder Prohibition, especially during the early
years, police were more strict in making arrests, and . . . a
larger proportion than formerly of persons appearing on the
streets under the influence of liquor are arrested. Also, since
the sale of liquor is illegal and cannot be obtained in public
saloons, and when the police are more strict in arresting
intoxicated persons, it is reasonable to suppose that drinking is
less public and that fewer drunken persons appear on the streets
relative to the quantity of liquor consumed </i>(Warburton, 1932:
103).<br>
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the cyclical trend suggested by these figures
coincides with statistics on alcoholism (Brown, 1932: 61, 71,
77). Whatever their independent validity, however, they correlate
earth the theory of one author that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>[T] he l8th Amendment could not have been passed without
the support of the psychologically tolerant, made temporarily
intolerant by the stress of war. But when the moderates deserted
the drys in the time of peace, the hard core of the movement was
revealed</i> (Sinclair, 1962: 23--24).<br>
</p>

<p>Without the support of the moderates, the author theorizes,
Prohibition was to become itself a symbol of excess, unsupported
by the vast majority of the population. </p>

<p>Outcome. What, then, did Prohibition accomplish? To a great
extent it eliminated the saloon from American life. While bars
and taverns reopened joyfully following repeal, they ceased to be
the centers of systematic political corruption and debauchery
which they had once been. Part of this may be attributable to the
greater sophistication of the electorate and politics generally.
Part, no doubt, is owing to the fact that women were welcome as
customers in the new cocktail lounges, having shown themselves to
be eager patrons of the speakeasies. </p>

<p>And finally, the change in the character of the saloon was
effected by public determination that it should be changed. This
attitude was expressed in the post-repeal statutes concerned with
the physical appearance of the saloon and the character of
persons authorized to operate them. </p>

<p>Prohibition did make the nation conscious that corruption of
the law and of the populace may be the consequence of a law which
is not reflective of the morals and mores of the time. It played
out some of the deepest social class resentments, culminating in
the realization that the behavioral standards of some could not
be impressed -upon others. It demonstrated that the fervor of war
and the cult of patriotism may be abused-and abuse the country in
return. </p>

<p>Repeal reimposed the burden of regulation upon the states.
They were required to develop a system of control directed at the
particular objectives they wished to achieve. The post-repeal era
was to prove an exercise not only in states' rights but in
states' responsibilities. <br>
</p>

<p><b>1933-1971: AFTER THE DELUGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>On December 4, 1933, the day before final ratification of the
repeal amendment, the President established the Federal Alcohol
Control Administration, pursuant to Executive Order No. 6474.
FACA was to have the power to grant or revoke permits to engage
in the alcoholic beverage industry-not the brewing industry-as
well as the power to control plant capacity and production; it
was also to engage in consumer protection through regulations
designed to prevent misbranding and false advertising of
alcoholic beverages. In addition, FACA prohibited the ownership
of retail outlets by manufacturers and wholesalers (Harrison
&amp; Laine, 1936: 24-29). </p>

<p>This scheme fell under the Schecter Poultry decision by the
Supreme Court. The Treasury, Federal Trade, Commission and Food
and Drug Administration then moved in. A new alcohol control
agency was proposed, leading to a dispute as to whether it should
be independent or part of the Treasury.<br>
</p>

<p>Joseph H. Choate, Jr., first head of the FACA, testified that:
</p>

<p><i>The Treasury has not been an organization whose duty it was
to study and understand the liquor business, the interest of the
public in that business, or the method by which that business
ought to be carried on in order to subserve the interests of both
the public and state governments. It has been a creature of one
idea, that one idea being, quite properly, to get revenue and get
it as fast and as copiously as it could </i>(Harrison &amp;
Laine, 1936: 33).<br>
</p>

<p>The Department of the Treasury agreed with Choate's analysis. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this testimony was disregarded and the Federal
Alcohol Administration was created as a division of Treasury in
1935. This arrangement was superseded in 1936 when the Liquor Tax
Administration Act established FACA as an independent agency of
the government. Soon thereafter it was reorganized, once again as
an arm of the Department of Treasury, and even its separate
identity was abolished as of June 30, 1940. Today, the Treasury
retains full authority to administer all federal liquor laws. </p>

<p>The current federal laws regulating trade in intoxicating
beverages may be classified in the following categories: </p>

<p>(1) Revenue: Taxes are imposed on rectifiers, brewers,
manufacturers of stills, dealers; wholesale and retail stamps are
required on distilled spirits (26 USC, 1971a). </p>

<p>(2) Criminal Penalties: Criminal penalties are provided for
unauthorized production, sale or possession, transportation into
states prohibiting sale, C.O.D. shipments and unlabeled shipments
(26 USC, 1971b; 18 USC, 1971). </p>

<p>(3) Interstate Transportation: Interstate shipments of
alcoholic beverages are subject to the laws of the receiving
state (27 USC, 1971a). </p>

<p>(4) Permits: Importers, manufacturers and sellers of
intoxicating beverages must have permits (27 USC, 1971b). </p>

<p>(5) Unfair Practices: Exclusive sales arrangements, tying,
bribery and false advertising or labeling are prohibited (27 USC,
1971b). </p>

<p>The intent of the Federal Government to reserve all decisions
regarding regulation of consumption is quite clear from federal
statutes presently in force. The states have reacted with a
variety of regulatory schemes controlling to varying degrees the
seller, the buyer, the place, time and opportunity for sale and,
through revenue measures, the cost. </p>

<p>In 18 states, the state store or state monopoly system has
entirely displaced the private wholesale or retail sale of
intoxicating beverages. Other states permit the sale of liquor,
wine and beer through private, licensed outlets. </p>

<p>The license system may be implemented by different, means.
Administration may be solely by the state, or control may be
shared by the counties or municipalities. </p>

<p>Local control may be exercised to a greater or lesser degree.
For example, in the 1930's, immediately after repeal,
Massachusetts and New Mexico permitted local boards to grant
retail licenses only after investigation and approval of
applicants by the state board. During the same period, other
states, predominantly in the South, gave local authorities
supplemental powers to issue licenses while requiring concurrent
state licenses as well.<br>
</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, the local license had to be obtained
first, and the state license could be granted thereafter. In
Illinois, however, the state commission's power was curtailed by
requiring that a state license be granted once the local license
was secured. And although the state was given the power to revoke
its license, it was given no power to inspect places of sale to
determine grounds for revocation (Harrison &amp; Laine, 1936:
50-53). </p>

<p>The license system has been suspect by many wets as well as
drys because of the opportunities it may afford for political
abuse. On the other hand, there is substantial opinion which
holds direct participation in the sale of liquor in contempt. As
to the relative efficacy of each, there are no reliable means of
making a judgment. Each apparently depends on the integrity and
capacity of the individuals charged with the job of enforcement
and oversight. </p>

<p>Superimposed on the basic system of regulating the sale of
liquor are other sumptuary laws which are directed at the
purchaser. Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated
persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well.
Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence
of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior.<br>
</p>

<p>The sale of liquor by the drink is permitted in most states,
but some still require that it be sold in packaged form only,
reflecting the continuing fear of the resurrection of the saloon.
In many states Sunday closing laws are enforced, and mandatory
closing times are imposed upon bars and package stores alike.
Sales are prohibited almost uniformly on Election Day, at least
during polling hours, and, in many places, on Thanksgiving,
Memorial Day, Christmas and other holidays. </p>

<p>Local option is still granted in most states, in voting units
ranging from the plantation to the city or county. Of the
monopoly or control states, only Utah and Wyoming fail to make
provision for local option at all. Wyoming maintains a state
monopoly at the wholesale level only. Private retailer sellers
are licensed. </p>

<p>In the remaining monopoly states, it is often possible for
towns within a wet county to go dry, and sometimes vice versa. Of
the 33 license states, only 10 (including the District of
Columbia) do not permit local option at any level. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the various patterns of regulation, Senator
Arthur Capper's words of the 1930's still seem to be correct: </p>

<p><i>We can repeal prohibition, but we cannot repeal the liquor
problem</i> (Peterson, 1969: 126).<br>
</p>

<p>Neither the states nor the population have yet come to grips
with the problems of alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Both the
monopoly system and the license system are directed at other
concerns. They, no more than Prohibition, have been able to
control or even alleviate the very real and dire consequences of
alcohol use by society.<br>
