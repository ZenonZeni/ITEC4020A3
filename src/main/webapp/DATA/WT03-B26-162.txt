<B>4. RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
</B><BR>
Out of the wide ranging discussions and issues addressed there were three
which were agreed as of particular importance for the AVHRR community to
achieve as soon as possible. These are: 
<UL>
<LI>Data receiving stations should process data so that the base and standard
products are consistent and to a specifiable and repeatable standard within
and between stations; 
<LI>Geometric accuracy should aim to be RMS of 1pixel with recommended algorithms
and processing plus measures of quality to be developed and implemented
as the next step; 
<LI>Absolute radiometric correction should aim to 5% with measures of quality
to be developed and implemented as the next step. 
</UL>
The resonsibility for taking steps to achieve these recommendations rests
jointly with CSIRO, BofMet, WASTAC, AIMS as well as the prime data users
in the State and Commonwealth Departments. Therefore a fourth recommendation
is: 
<UL>
<LI>CSIRO EOC should convene a group consisting of data receivers and data
users to establish the workable solutions for these goals. 
</UL>
