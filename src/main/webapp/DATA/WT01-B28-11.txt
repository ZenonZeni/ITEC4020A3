<p><font size="5"><strong>Chapter 7 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>The Pure -Food and Drug Act of 1906</strong></font><br>
</p>

<p>A major step forward in the control of opiate addiction was
taken in 1906 </p>

<p>when Congress passed the first Pure Food and Drug Act despite
opposition </p>

<p>from the patent-medicine interests. The pressures to pass the
act were </p>

<p>intense-generated by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley and his crusading
journalistic </p>

<p>followers, notably Samuel Hopkins Adams,' who were known as
&quot;muckrakers.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The 1906 act required that medicines containing opiates and
certain other </p>

<p>drugs must say so on their labels.2 Later amendments to the
act also </p>

<p>required that the quantity of each drug be truly stated on the
label, and </p>

<p>that the drugs meet official standards of identity and purity.
Thus, for a </p>

<p>time the act actually served to safeguard addicts.<br>
</p>

<p>The efforts leading to the 1906 act, the act itself and
subsequent </p>

<p>amendments, and educational campaigns urging families not to
use patent </p>

<p>medicines containing opiates, no doubt helped curb the making
of new </p>

<p>addicts. Indeed, there is evidence of a modest decline in
opiate addiction </p>

<p>from the peak in the 1890s until 1914.3<br>
</p>

<p>For those already addicted, however, the protection afforded
by the 1906 </p>

<p>act and by subsequent amendments was short-lived, for in 1914
Congress </p>

<p>passed the Harrison Narcotic Act, which cut off altogether the
supply of </p>

<p>legal opiates to addicts. As a result, the door was opened
wide to </p>

<p>adulterated, contaminated, and misbranded black-market
narcotics of all </p>

<p>kinds. The heroin available on the street in the United States
today, for </p>

<p>example, is a highly dangerous mixture of small amounts of
heroin with </p>

<p>large and varying amounts of adulterants. The black market
similarly </p>

<p>distributes today large quantities of adulterated,
contaminated, and </p>

<p>misbranded LSD and other drugs. The withdrawal of the
protection of the </p>

<p>food-and-drug laws from the users of illicit drugs, as we
shall show, has </p>

<p>been one of the sign)ficant factors in reducing addicts to
their present </p>

<p>miserable status, and in making drug use so damaging today. </p>
