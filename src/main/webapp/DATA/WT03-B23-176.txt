<P>
As the name states, stock funds invest primarily
in stocks. However, each stock fund's portfolio will vary depending
on the fund's investment objectives. Some funds will stress growth,
some income and some a combination of both. They will also differ
in the amount of investment risk they take. For example, one fund
may only buy established growth stocks while another will buy
stocks in emerging growth companies.

<P>
Like individual investors, funds will buy 	<A HREF="stocktyp.htm#stockblu">Blue Chip Stocks</A> for income and safety; <A HREF="stocktyp.htm#stockgro">Growth Stocks</A> for future appreciation; 	<A HREF="stocktyp.htm#stockval">Value Stocks</A> for stability
and growth; and 	<A HREF="stocktyp.htm#stockcyc">Cyclical Stocks</A> to take advantage
of periods of economic growth. However, the major difference in
buying a fund rather than individual stocks is the diversity that
an investor can attain for the same amount of money.

<UL>
<LI><B>Capital Appreciation or Aggressive Growth
Funds</B> --- aim for maximum capital
appreciation, primarily through the use of equities. Some of the
investment strategies may include high portfolio turnover, leveraging,
purchasing unregistered securities, and options. If the market
conditions are not right, the portfolio manager may hold a large
cash position. On a continuum, this category is very speculative
and volatile with the risk of above-average losses to receive
above-average gains.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
 
<UL>
<LI><B>Growth Funds</B>
--- invest in companies whose long-term earnings are expected
to grow significantly faster than the stocks represented in the
major stock market indices. The stocks are generally in mid- or
large-capitalization companies whose earnings are expected to
rise faster than those of the overall market. Growth funds
are generally considered to be more conservative than capital
appreciation or aggressive growth funds.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
 
<UL>
<LI><B>Small-Company Growth Funds</B>
--- limit their investments to companies based on size.
Average market capitalization may be anywhere from the micro $50
million to the larger $950 million. Investors should be aware
that small stocks run in market cycles and can be extremely volatile.
Small stocks are generally considered very speculative and volatile
with the risk of above-average losses in an attempt to receive higher
gains.</LI>

<UL>
<LI><B>Growth and Income Funds</B>
--- seek capital appreciation as well as dividend income. The
funds generally buy stocks that pay high dividends and show good
earnings growth. They often pay quarterly dividends and when reinvested,
offer a form of &quot;forced&quot; <A HREF="mudca.htm">Dollar-Cost Averaging</A>, which adds to this type of fund's more conservative nature when compared
to growth or aggressive growth funds. Risk of loss is considered
average.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
 
<UL>
<LI><B>Sector Funds</B>
--- focus on stocks of a particular industry or segment of the
economy, such as technology, healthcare or financial services.
Unlike most mutual funds that are diversified across different
industries, sector funds are more specific. Although the funds are
more diversified than a single stock, there is nothing in their 
portfolios to offset a downturn in the sector. Since sectors
are highly volatile, they offer opportunity for large gains to
investors who ride the right wave.</LI>
