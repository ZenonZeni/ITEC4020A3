Large New York City law firm <BR>
relies on NewsNet's timeliness</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>


For more than a decade the library staff at Shearman & Sterling has been relying on NewsNet for timely company and litigation news from both the newswires and from many newsletters.<P> 

Established in 1873, Shearman & Sterling is one of the largest law firms in New York City.  Fred Shanks, a reference librarian for its headquarters in New York and one of its primary NewsNet users, signs on to the system each business day to check his NewsFlash profiles. NewsFlash is one of his favorite NewsNet features. He likes being able to continually monitor news stories in the media and track particular issues of interest. Corporate information, tax and bankruptcy news, and general litigation are some of the main points of interest for Fred and his coworkers.<P>

The timeliness of information retrieved from NewsNet, especially those articles clipped in NewsFlash, is one of NewsNet's most attractive features according to Fred.   "We can pull stories that have come out in the last couple of hours or so, and that's a real advantage," he said.<P>

Accessing the wire services through SCAN and SEARCH are also popular activities with the NewsNet users at Shearman & Sterling.  Getting current, relevant information on NewsNet is elementary. <P>
