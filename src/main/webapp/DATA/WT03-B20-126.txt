<h2>Saving Energy in the '90s</h2><p>
<b>by Christine A. Ervin</b><p>
<p>
It has been nearly 20 years since we experienced our last oil shock in 
the
United States. Should we still care about using energy more efficiently, 
and
about making greater use of solar, wind and other types of renewable 
energy?<p>

You bet. Even though no crisis appears to be lurking around the corner, 
there
is more reason than ever for each of us to make our country, our 
community and
our personal lives cleaner, wealthier, healthier and more productive with 
good
energy choices.<p>

Never before have we consumers had so many options for saving energy 
dollars.
Since the last energy crises in the 1970s, America's scientists and
entrepreneurs have developed new generations of products--super-saving
appliances, incredibly efficient lighting, intelligent designs for 
buildings,
clean industrial processes that prevent the generation of wastes, cars 
that
operate on renewable fuels rather than gasoline. <p>

These are no longer the gizmos of the future. Many of the new energy
technologies--ranging from wind machines to passive solar buildings, and 
from
compact fluorescent lights to cars powered by natural gas--are on the 
market
today, providing clean energy at money-saving prices.<p>

Today, wind machines are producing electric power as cheaply as coal or
nuclear power plants in some parts of the United States. In parts of the
Midwest and Northeast, there is enough untapped wind to provide more than

enough electricity for the entire country.<p>

Geothermal heat pumps, which heat and cool buildings using the earth's 
natural
temperatures, are growing in popularity. Passive solar buildings, which 
make
use of sunlight for heat and illumination, continue appearing all around 
the
country. And photovoltaic cells--those wafer-thin devices that power
calculators, watches and satellites--are providing economical electricity 
in all
types of remote applications, from park shelters to highway signs. One 
utility
--the Sacramento Municipal Utility District--is building its next power 
plant on
the roofs of its customers, in the form of house-by-house photovoltaic
panels.<p>

More revolutionary products are on the horizon. At the U.S. Department of

Energy (DOE), to give just two examples, we are researching ways to make
completely recyclable automobiles, cars that get three times more fuel 
mileage
than the models on the road today, and roofing shingles that produce
electricity when exposed to sunlight.<p>

Without a crisis to spur us on, why should we care about improving our 
energy
efficiency and expanding our use of renewable energy systems? There are 
many
reasons.<p>

The money each of us saves on our energy bills is like new tax-free 
income.
That new income not only makes us wealthier, it also creates jobs for 
others as
we spend the money on other goods and services. Studies done for DOE 
indicate
that each dollar invested in energy efficiency creates more employment 
than
dollars spent on many other types of investment, including building new 
power
plants.<p>

Efficiency and renewable energy strengthen the economy in other ways, 
too.
Today, the United States imports nearly 50% of its petroleum from 
elsewhere--
more than during the oil shocks of the 1970s--and the amount is projected 
to
rise to 60% by 2010. Most of our foreign trade deficit is due to these 
imports.
Reducing oil imports lowers the trade deficit, makes our economy 
healthier, and
keeps dollars at home, creating jobs. <p>

Reducing our dependence on imports may also reduce the number of military

conflicts the United States is forced to confront in the future. <p>

By investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy at home, we can 
make
these young U.S. industries stronger and more competitive in the global
marketplace. Today, half the world's people do not have electricity. 
Massive
nations like China and India are undertaking development projects that 
will
open up vast new markets for energy technologies.<p>

By capturing these opportunities, U.S. energy efficiency and renewable 
energy
companies will not only increase America's exports, they'll also help 
make sure
that newly industrializing nations are built upon foundations of clean,
inexhaustible energy supplies.<p>

And that leads to another major benefit:  Energy efficiency and most 
renewable
energy systems prevent pollution and many other types of environmental 
damages.
At home and abroad, they are the key to making economic growth compatible 
with
environmental health.<p>

There have never been more good reasons or more good opportunities for 
each of
us to take advantage of energy efficiency and renewable resources. If you 
want
to learn more about your choices, call DOE's Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable
Energy Clearinghouse at 1-800-363-3732.<p>
