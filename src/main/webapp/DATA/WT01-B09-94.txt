<B>Project Title:  Federal Railroad Administration Next Generation High Speed Rail Program<p>
Performing Organization: The University of Texas at Austin, Center for Electromechanics</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: John H. Price <BR>

Telephone: (5l5) 471­4496 </P>


<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of operation a hybrid locomotive propulsion
system consisting of a gas turbine and a flywheel energy storage system in a railroad locomotive. The
ultimate goal of the program is to develop a fossil­fuel locomotive capable of sustained speeds of
150mph on existing rail infrastructure, with acceleration comparable to that of an electric locomotive.</P>
<P>Additional goals are to develop a system that is reliable, fuel efficient, and in compliance with
applicable noise and air emission requirements. ALPS includes a 3MW turbine­alternator to maintain a
cruising speed of 150 mph, and a 600 MJ (165 kW­hr) flywheel energy storage system capable of
delivering an additional 3 MW for rapid acceleration, speed maintenance on grades, and recovery of
braking energy.</P><P> Program Phase I is structured to demonstrate a full­scale flywheel energy storage
system in the laboratory. Program Phase II is planned to provide a rolling demonstration of the
technology in a General Motors Electro­Motive Division locomotive. Phase I is cost shared by the
development team members. </P>
