<p><strong>TUCSON, Ariz.</strong> - In a keynote speech to a Nov. 16 forum on 
prison labor, Patricia Clark compared prison labor in the 
U.S. to the maquiladora plants along the Mexican border. 
"Prison labor has taken a form much like maquiladoras" Clark 
said, adding that now, with privatization and "new" prison 
industries, prisoner labor has become a source of corporate 
superprofits.</p>

<p>Clark, who heads up the criminal justice program for the 
American Friends Service Committee, spoke at a one-day 
meeting titled "Factories with Fences." In her presentation, 
Clark gave a compelling overview of a US prison system 
which, she said, "is headed for disaster."</p>

<p>After pointing out that a majority of U.S. residents commit 
crimes for which they could be jailed, Clark reminded her 
audience that almost all prisoners are drawn from a narrow 
segment of society. "African American males, for example, 
make up only 6 percent of the total population, but account 
for the majority of prisoners," she said. "They are more 
likely to be arrested and more likely to be convicted." She 
said that white collar lawbreakers, on the other hand, are 
less likely to get caught and serve shorter sentences when 
they are.</p>

<p>The forum was initiated by the American Friends Service 
Committee and cosponsored by the Coalition of Black Trade 
Unionists, Salt of the Earth Labor College and groups 
concerned with peace and prisoner rights. Workshops were 
held on labor, chain gangs, privatization, and the rights of 
prison laborers.</p>

<p>The labor workshop included a panel made up of Clark, local 
Jobs with Justice leader Steve Valencia and Fred Markusen 
and James Beverly, both of whom are correction employees. 
Markusen described how in the 20 years since he began 
working, the prison population increased tenfold.</p>

<p>Beverly who is a leader of American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees and the Coalition of Black 
Trade Unionists, blasted the idea of private prisons, citing 
studies showing that private prisons suffer from high staff 
turnover, lower pay, a high level of violence and high 
escape rates. "They have no rehab programs," he said, and 
are run by those who have a "lock 'em up" mentality.</p>

<p>Valencia said the issues of prison labor and privatization 
"are in character with the most vile features of corporate 
America." He said both were a "fast-track transfer of public 
wealth to private coffers."</p>
