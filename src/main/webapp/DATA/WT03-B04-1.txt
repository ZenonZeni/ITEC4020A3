RM60m for SHL"s expansion

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Ishun P. Ahmad

SHL Consolidated Bhd has allocated RM60 million for the expansion of its
brick and quarry operations in its scheme to develop them as core
activities in future.
  Executive director, Mr Yap Teiong Choon told reporters yesterday after
SHL's annual general meeting that from the RM60 million, RM40 million will
be invested for the construction of a third fully automated brick plant in
Sepang while RM10 million will used for the upgrading of its first brick
plant.
  "The remaining RM10 million is set aside for the expansion of a third
quarry plant which will increase the present annual production capacity of
3 million tonnes by another 1.5 million tonnes giving a total annual
production capacity of 4.5 million tonnes," Yap said.
  The third plant, which is expected to be installed by 1998, will add-on
another annual production capacity of 100 million pieces of bricks to its
current annual capacity of 200 million pieces of bricks.
  The new plant is expected to start construction in the third quarter of
next year.
  The upgrading of the first plant involves the construction of a new
tunnel kiln and extension of a new factory space together with further
add-on of new equipment.
  Yap said the expansion will see it to be the largest manufacturer of
bricks in Malaysia and a major player in the quarry business which will
help improve future profits.
  "From our experience in the quarry business, we foresee the new quarry
plant will generate about RM10 million annual profits," Yap said.
  Meanwhile, Yap said that SHL is in the process of negotiating a number
of big projects but declined to disclose the amount and when the projects
are expected to be finalised.

Across the board: Hefty rises on second board may elicit queries

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Adi Satria

HEFTY rises in the prices of Second Board stocks may be sweet for those
individuals who happen to own the stocks but for the companies concerned,
a sudden surge in prices and volume traded invariably elicit queries from
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
  This is as it should be because of the danger of small capitalised
stocks being manipulated by syndicates which if left unchecked, would lead
to a sudden plunge in prices - and volume - and those who would suffer
most would be most likely the individual retail players.
  Of course, not all individuals who buy second board stocks lose money
because if they had bought the stocks sometime ago when prices were lower,
they would still stand to gain if prices drop sharply.
  A retail player who bought his shares in a second board company when the
Second Board Index was at the 300 or 400 point level.
  However, given the small number of shares floating around among the
small capitalised stocks on the second board, it would not have taken much
buying power for prices to jump up over the last few weeks.
  What this means is that if many players had been chasing stocks on the
way up, many of them would have bought them at the higher end of the price
range.
  Those who play second board stocks would have realised by now that if a
person buys second board stock to keep it and then wait for something to
happen which would push up the price, he may have to wait for quite
sometime. Maybe even a long time because there are some second board
stocks which are thinly traded and their prices barely move.
  Therefore, the person who buys a second board stock may see his money
tied in the market for an uncomfortably long time because it is not easy
to sell his stock if he needs money urgently.
  In short, the lack of liquidity among the small second board stocks is a
drawback for those may want to buy stocks when the market is "quiet." It
may be so quiet that he will not be able to find a buyer for his stock at
a reasonable price.
  The net effect of this lack of liquidity among second board stocks is
that  many punters prefer to indulge in buying and selling of second board
stocks when there is already a build-up in the volume so that there is
sufficient liquidity for him to get in fast and get out even faster when
there is a need to do so.
  Unfortunately, given the small capitalisation, by the time there is a
surge in the trading volume of second board stocks - and thus in their
liquidity - their prices would have shot up to quite a high level.
  The upshot of this is that it is at this time when many punters jump
into the second board stocks, thus ending up buying the stocks at
dangerously high prices. However, after a sharp pullback, second board
stocks need not necessarily continue to slide.
  Like all cycles, second board stocks have their ups and downs, and they
can come back again - the only question is when they will make a comeback.
Many punters will, of course, hope that they do not have to wait too long
for their comeback.

AMALGAMATED Industrial Steel Bhd (AISB) has aborted its 100 per cent
proposed acquisition of Prisma Meridian Sdn Bhd, Infostas Engineering Sdn
Bhd and a three-for-five rights issue of 61.55 million new AISB shares of
RM0.50 each at an issue price of RM5.50 per share.
  This is because the directors have been informed that Teknologi Tenaga
Perlis Sdn Bhd (TTP)'s right to finance, construct, own and operate a gas-
fuelled combined cycle power station of 650MW in Perlis has been made void
as it has been awarded to Teknologi Tenaga Perlis Consortium Sdn Bhd.
  As a result, the company has decided to abort the proposed acquisition
and consequently not to raise equity finance required through the proposed
rights issue to invest in TTP.

Hwa Tai ventures into building

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Elena Shamsuddin

BISCUITS manufacturer, Hwa Tai Food Industries Bhd is said to be
diversifying into the construction sector following the recent acquisition
of a stake in the company by Mancon Bhd.
  With this new venture, Hwa Tai is hoping that in the long term,
contribution from the construction segment will "be the same" with its
biscuits manufacturing, said a source.
  At the moment, said the source, Hwa Tai is doing earthworks at a cost of
RM15 million, for a 2,000-unit medium cost residential development project
by Mancon in Lukut.
  The source who is close to the company also pointed out that Hwa Tai,
with no landbanks, is on the look out for more land to be developed in
East Malaysia as well as in Peninsular Malaysia.
  Hwa Tai, which is listed on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) is also aiming for a transfer to the main board in the
next two to three years, said the source.
  On Hwa Tai's biscuits manufacturing, he said that Hwa Tai plans to build
one factory each in a 4.5ha piece of land in Senai, Johore and an 8.1ha
land in Bukit Rakit, Terengganu.
  He said Hwa Tai has submitted layout plans to the respective state
authorities, and approval for the land in Senai is expected to be obtained
earlier than the approval for Bukit Rakit.

DVB meets local, foreign demand

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Lokman Mansor

DELLOYD Ventures Bhd (DVB), manufacturer and distributor of automotive
parts and accessories, en route for a listing on the Main Board of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM29.27
million for the year ending December 31 1996.
  The forecast includes net earnings per share of 34.75 sen, and proposed
gross dividend of 6 per cent worth RM2.73 million, according to its
prospectus released on Saturday.
  The 10-year-old DVB Group expects its business relationship with
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton), its largest client, to
strengthen further, following the setting up of DVB's factory-cum-
warehouse at the DRB-Hicom Proton City project in Perak.
  "About 66 per cent of the group's turnover last year is attributable to
Proton and EON Trading Sdn Bhd. Orders have been increasing, including
those requiring production to commence only in 1997," DVB managing
director Tee Boon Kee said in an interview.
  He said although the group presently commits a significant part of its
production facilities to Proton, there exists a ready OEM market which is
constantly requesting the group to increase its current supplies of
automotive parts and accessories.
  "Efforts to expand and diversify our customer base is expected to result
in sales increasing to such an extent that percentage of sales to Proton,
although expected to follow a growing trend, will decrease in future.
Everything will balance out," Tee added.
  In line with its overseas marketing strategy, the DVB group is already
seeking to expand its export customer base through the manufacture and
supply of radio antennas to Thailand for Toyota cars, and the manufacture
and supply of automotive parts and accessories for PT Timor Putra
Nasional, the Indonesian national car manufacturer.
  "Our products are already exported there. Eventually, we plan to set up
manufacturing facilities in Indonesia," he said.
  DVB's list of international direct export customers include countries in
South-East Asia and West Asia, Pakistan, the US, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, New
Zealand, Brazil and Fiji.
  Tee said the group also has plans to set up overseas joint venture
companies to strengthen its international marketing and distribution
networks with both its existing and new potential customers.
  DVB's other future plans include diversifying its product base for the
manufacturing of new automotive parts and accessories. These include
mirror lens for interior and exterior view mirrors, and door latches for
cars through a technical assistance and license agreement with a German
company.

George Town to diversify

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Ishun P. Ahmad

GEORGE Town Holdings Bhd expects to not only expand its current activities
but also to diversify into film studios, entertainment centres and theme
parks to ensure long-term growth.
  Chairman Tuanku Abdullah Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman says in the
latest annual report that the RM204.75 million from the proceeds of its
rights issue in November 1995 were used to expand its overseas business
and its existing operations.
  He says George Town has acquired a project in Leavesden, north-west of
London, which will house England's first movie theme studio tour and
family entertainment complex, comparable with that of Universal Studio,
Disneyland, and Disneyworld.
  Reviewing its financial standing, he notes that George Town has posted a
slightly higher group pre-tax profit of RM12.33 million for the year ended
March 31 1996 compared to RM12.19 million in 1995. This is on the back of
a turnover of RM310.20 million compared to RM310.11 million previously.
  Profit after-tax before minority interest improved slightly to RM8.02
million compared to RM7.92 million previously.
  Directors are recommending a final dividend of eight per cent less tax
for the year just ended.
  During the year under review, George Town Chemist Sdn Bhd opened two
oulets, one each in Kuala lumpur and Port Klang, bringing its total to 25
in the Klang Valley.

Notebook: An investor modest enough to admit making mistakes

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

By Yee Liam

THERE is this seasoned investor who told his friends that he had been
buying and selling stocks for over 30 years, experienced five major market
declines and yet he still makes the same mistakes.
  The only investor who does not make any mistake is a dead one and even
if he were to somehow return from the dead to invest in stocks, he is
likely to commit the same mistakes as before.
  The seasoned investor is modest enough to admit that he continues making
mistakes but as he is still rich and continues to speculate, he must be
making fewer of the same mistakes over the years. Otherwise, he is
unlikely to be rich today because if he had continued making the same
number of mistakes as he did in the early years of speculation in stocks,
chances are he would have lost most of his money by now.
  If he had gone through five major market downturns, it is logical that
he would have survived each of the downturns and participated in the
subsequent market rallies.
  He may have lost money because of the mistakes he made in each of the
boom and bust market cycles but as he is still wealthy today, his personal
scoreboard suggests that his right decisions outweigh his wrong decisions
in the stock market. The net effect of his decisions is that his profits
over the years have more than offset the losses incurred.
  Only an ignorant investor will strive for a perfect score and hope to
see profits in all his trades and suffer no losses.
  The most dangerous experience that a new investor can undergo when he
first ventures into the market is that of striking it big and making a lot
of money in his initial trades. He will think that making money is so easy
in the stock market, failing to realise that losing it could be even
easier if he becomes careless and over-expose himself. A new investor is
commonly in a hurry to make big money and consequently endangers himself
by taking on too much risk.
  A wise man knows his own limitations and accepts these limitations
gracefully and this seasoned investor is certainly wise because he readily
admits to his friends his limitations as an investor - one of which is
that he continues to make mistakes in stocks.
  He will still be making mistakes because he is only human and there is
no way he can avoid them completely as long as he is subject to the same
emotions and impulses which all human beings have.
  The only difference is that a successful investor makes fewer mistakes
than a less successful one, but they are likely to continue to make
mistakes.
  An experienced investor is likely to make fewer mistakes than the newer
one because he would have learnt from his past mistakes and make repeated
attempts to avoid them.
  Still, despite being more alert in avoiding mistakes, the experienced
investor will occasionally make some mistakes but he would have taken
precaution to make sure than he is not fatally injured financially and
that he will recover to fight another day in the market.
  After so many years of involvement in stocks, he will be realistic
enough to accept the fact that mistakes are unavoidable in stocks.
  More often than not, it is the new and inexperienced investor who goes
around with the notion that they must not make mistakes if they are to be
successful in stocks. He feels that many of those who came before him lost
money or if they did make money, they should be making more money, because
they made mistakes in their trading.
  As far as this new punter is concerned, he is out to "prove" that he
will be better than many of them because he will not make the same
mistakes committed by many others before him.
  He may not have realised it at this early stage but he had just made his
first mistake by carrying in his head the erroneous idea that he will not
make mistakes in the market. Over time he will realise how wrong he was.
  Ironically, by accepting the simple fact that making mistakes is part
and parcel of the whole business of speculation, the punter is better
prepared mentally to avoid the mistakes that come in our way.
  The reason is simple. If a speculator buys a stock because he feels that
the price will double in two months' time, he will not hesitate to get rid
of it if it does not perform to his expectations after one month. For
instance, if the price falls sharply instead of rising, he may quickly re-
examine the stock and come round to the conclusion that he had been
mistaken about the stock. He accepts that he can make mistakes and before
any further damage is done, he may decide to cut loss and clear out of the
stock.
  A punter who carries the notion that he will not make mistakes may not
be psychologically prepared to accept mistakes even if he is uncertain of
a stock anymore.
  Instead of acting fast and cutting losses if a trade has gone wrong and
he had obviously made a mistake, he may just refuse to budge and continue
hoping that things will get better.
  He has already made up his mind that mistakes will cause him to lose
money and as he does not want to lose money, he will not make mistakes and
by refusing to sell to cut losses, he can continue with the fiction that
he has not made a mistake. It tends to become a vicious cycle and it can
be costly to the punter when the vicious cycle is finally broken by him
selling out to cut his losses.
  There is this thing about realising one's losses and if a punter has to
ultimately realise his loss, it is better than he realise it sooner rather
than later because that way, he minimises his loss. Inaction and refusal
to accept reality can be enemies of the successful punter.
  If the punter cannot avoiding mistakes because stocks can be so volatile
and unpredictable, then he can at least minimise the damage that can be
caused when he makes the inevitable mistakes.

Ariston to compensate land occupants in Sihanoukville project

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

By Leela Barrock in Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH, Sun: Ariston Sdn Bhd has agreed to pay some US$400,000 (US$1 =
RM2.51) in compensation to 360 families who are occupying land on the site
of the Kang Keng airport and on Naga Island, in Sihanoukville.
  "We are paying the compensation on behalf of the Royal Government of
Cambodia, eventhough land is a state matter," Mr Tan Teng Chye, Ariston's
project director, said in Sihanoukville.
  Ariston, which was awarded the US$1.3 billion Sihanoukville development
project, was accused of dragging its feet in starting work on the project,
by several quarters, including Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
  The Malaysian company explained that it was unable to begin renovation
work at the Sihanoukville International Airport - the first phase of the
project - as it was unable to obtain vacant possesion of the land.
  The amount that was paid to the various families is said to vary
according to the size of land each family lived or worked on.
  According to Tan, Ariston was advised on the amounts to be paid to the
villagers by a special task force within the Sihanoukville Development
Authority that was set up to determine the figure.
  According to the villagers and some of the provincial officials, the
cheques reportedly ranged from US$25 to more than US$3,000.
  However, Tan said Ariston has still not obtained vacant posession of the
land as the villagers are still on the land. "They should move off soon
and then we should be able to get things going," he told Business Times in
a telephone interview.
  Ariston has begun work on Naga Island, however, where an international
standard casino resort and hotel will be built.
  The deputy governor, Kim Bo, who witnessed the handing over ceremony,
said the villagers had arrived at a mutual understanding with the Royal
Government and were happy to accept the compensation.
  "I am aware that my land is located on a development site and I am happy
with the compensation," a villager was quoted as saying in a local
newspaper.
  He admitted that he was among those who had taken up weapons and
demonstrated at the airport site in May this year.
  "I thought that my land was being invaded by Ariston at the time and so
I took an axe to fight against them. But now I find they are honourable
and I am very happy with the compensation," he said.
  Neither Tan nor Cambodian officials would specify the amount of cash
that had been paid for each plot of land.
  However, Cambodian officials say the agreed compensation that was paid
by Ariston amounted to some US$1,500 for each hectare of land, though
other sources say US$1,700 was paid per hectare of land.
  Meanwhile, Ariston signed three agreements in mid-September with the
Royal Goverment that will expedite work on the Sihanoukville project.
  The first agreement was for the lease of land on Naga Island for a 70-
year period. Naga will be the site of an international standard hotel
resort and casino.
  The second was a land lease agreement for O Cheou Teal, involving the
development of an 18-hole international golf course and international
hotel.
  The third agreement was a 25-year build, operate and transfer (BOT)
concession agreement for the Sihanoukville International Airport.

Off market: Giving local analysts prominence

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

By Datuk Salleh Majid

A CHIEF executive of a stockbroking company told me how difficult it was
for him to get an appointment from an old friend. This friend happens to
be one of the key executives of a big and still expanding outfit listed on
the stock exchange with operations so diverse from the original core that
it is difficult to keep track. One day this chief executive thought, why
not look up this old friend and since his background is research, he
thought it might be a good idea to know what is happening with the
company. Instead, he was surprised to be greeted with a barrage of
questions, cynical enough to question his motive of seeking an
appointment. He said to himself that he is not going to ever call this old
friend for an appointment again. He felt if it has been any of the foreign
analysts such as Merril Lynch, Solomon or BZW, in no time will they be
granted an appointment. He is wondering what is happening to our
executives? Don't they realise that by being reluctant to meet local
analysts they are placing the local analyst in a more disadvantaged
position than the foreign ones?
  Not too long ago the Research Institute of Investment Analyst Malaysia
(RIIAM) conducted `Meet the Analysts' sessions for listed companies.
Although we had some response from some listed companies, but overall it
was difficult to get anybody to face the local analysts. In the end the
sessions were stopped for lack of response. At the same time we read about
companies with their entourage going overseas to meet the foreign analysts
or accommodating requests of foreign analysts. Maybe local analysts do not
represent billions or trillions of dollars foreign ones do, but disclosure
of information to our local investors will certainly help improve the
current situation of believing in rumours, so typical of the Malaysian
market. Take the second board companies for example, the whole euphoria
has the semblance of the 1993 bull run and prices are really getting to
dizzy heights. The amount of rumour being generated is unbelievable so
much so those so familiar with the characteristics of our investors need
only to generate some ridiculous rumour to get their support.
  This year the focus has certainly been on the second board but the
gullibility of the investors have certainly not been confined to just the
second board companies. The dialogue with local analysts was intended to
help enhance the transparency of companies. With the rapid pace of
economic growth it is not strange to find the rapid change in a company's
situation. The number of companies listed too increase rapidly and one
hardly has time to differentiate the numerous acronyms companies assume.
If companies are reluctant to entertain requests made by local individual
analysts, then the dialogue with a number of analysts might save a lot of
time and be more beneficial for the local investors. One cannot really
pass a law to stop rumour mongering. Neither can one pass a law to believe
in a rumour. If a rumour is being worked upon very hard by certain
individual to make it look like it is not a rumour (the prices actually go
up as claimed), it is even more difficult to convince the public not to
believe in rumours. So much has been said about the importance of relying
on fundamentals but this year anyone can throw fundamentals away by
showing the increase in the prices of second board companies.
  So much has been said of the importance of not relying on rumours about
the importance of investing in fundamentals but this year what seems to
drive the market is the same thing that drove the market in 93 and 94. The
volume of trade may be inflated by those who trade intraday, purely on
speculation. Do we limit the increase narrower? Do we limit the increase
on the first day of listing? Do we restrict the availability of
speculative trading? Do we restrict the flow of funds to the stockbroking
companies so that they cannot grant too many facilities to their clients?
Or do we shorten the settlement period so that there is not much room for
speculative activities? These are not easy questions to answer. We need to
balance between maintaining order and the need to allow the market to take
its course. If allowing to take its course means a lot of people are going
to get hurt, does it mean we will still allow it to happen?
  In the meantime, companies should come forward to be more transparent in
their activities and not necessarily wait for queries should there be any
irregularity. Periodic meetings with analysts will certainly enhance
investors' understanding of the corporate sector. Provided of course the
analysts do not keep the information to themselves.

Improved services with accountability

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

By Wendy Lim

THE corporatisation of the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of
Malaysia (Sirim) will be different from other such exercises undertaken by
the Government. This is because the role, contribution and viability of
Sirim will not be measured by its revenue-earning capacity.
  Sirim Bhd president and chief executive Dr Mohamed Ariffin Aton said its
corporatisation will allow a more flexible management system for it to
provide fast, efficient, cost-effective and customer-oriented services
with accountability.
  "Ultimately, we want to be cost effective and broaden our customer base
and train our people to make decisions at their level. This will certainly
speed things up but quality is maintained as they know their job well.
  "At the same time, everyone learns about responsibility and will be held
accountable for making that decision," he told Business Times in Shah
Alam.
  Ariffin was the managing director of Petronas Research Sdn Bhd before he
was appointed to head Sirim Bhd, taking over from Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin
Ali who became the executive chairman of Tenaga Nasional Bhd,
  For Sirim to achieve quality and speed, Ariffin is embarking on an
"inside out" quality services strategy to meet its vision.
  He believes that quality, when planted internally, will progress
naturally outwards.
  "In our day-to-day work, for example, the finance department which holds
the traditionally role of scrutinising every claim will have to think of
its colleagues as clients.
  "Some think this will encourage forgery but the claimants have a
responsibility and are accountable for their claims.
  "In this way, there will be continuous improvement and value creation
for the company to move faster. Ultimately, Sirim is the people," Ariffin
said.
  Sirim's vision, he said, is to be a renowned institution in three of its
core businesses: research, technology development, and standardisation.
  His said his task is to strenghten the competency base and put in place
the research and development (R and D) strategy.
  Sirim's technology competencies include industrial instrumentation and
electronics, industrial automation, automotive, measurements and
artificial intelligence systems.
  Ariffin said R and D does not necessarily get one's hands dirty. "There
is also a management side to it which I am dealing with."
  He feels that R and D is a continuing process of investment and regards
researchers as "a special breed of people who are very independent".
  "It is an intellectually challenging experience to be in the group," he
said.
  Ariffin, who considers working as his pastime and thinking of solutions
as his hobby, feels that the biggest challenge in managing researchers is
to change their perception of research work as a service.
  "Research is not a hobby, especially when there is a sponsor, and
researchers must try to provide the quality work in as short a time as
possible within a limited budget," he said.
  On human resource management, Ariffin said he is not worried that
Sirim's staff will be pinched. "All good companies will have staff
movement. Those who move away from Sirim are not totally lost as they will
be contributing to the country in other ways."

PM unhappy with UN Security Council"s failure to censure Israel

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir Mohamad yesterday expressed
disappointment with the UN Security Council members for their failure to
censure the Israeli Government led by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu for breaching
the peace agreement between Palestine and Israel.
  "The Security Council members should have taken into account the various
violations committed by the Netanyahu Government such imposing blockades
on Palestine by preventing Palestinian aircraft to land on the Palestinian
airport, preventing Palestinians to commute to work, and building of
Israeli settlements," he told reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz
International Airport yesterday.
  "Members of the Security Council failed to accuse Israel of committing
these violations out of fear of being branded as pro-Palestine," Dr
Mahathir said.
  "That is why we had the (UN Security Council's) resolution calling for
the cessation of hostilities, closure of tunnel and resumption of peace
talks.
  "I am attracted to (British Foreign Secretary Malcolm) Rifkind's speech,
where he outlined one-by-one all the violations of treaty committed by
Israel since Netanyahu took office as Israeli Prime Minister."

Amcorp sees abundant opportunities for expansion

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

WITH the Malaysian economy heading for the ninth consecutive year of
strong growth, opportunities are abound for Arab-Malaysian Corp Bhd
(Amcorp) to further enhance its position as a leading provider of
financial, property and infrastructure services, says its chairman Tan Sri
Azman Hashim.
  In his latest annual statement, the chairman says the group will
"entrench our strategy on our financial and property/infrastructure
services expertise to create synergies these two core business areas and
at the same time, seek to develop our interests in other sectors such as
industrial services".
  Reviewing the group's performance, Azman says the group's core business
areas continued to record impressive growth.
  Amcorp's activities in property development have been given a boost when
it acquired about 82.96ha of land for the development of 311 bungalow lots
under the exclusive Kayang Heights development project, which is next to
the Bukit Cerakah Forest Reserve in Shah Alam.
  Amcorp has also successfully concluded conditional mandatory general
offers for shares in two companies. The first being the shares in
Melawangi Sdn Bhd, developer of the prestigious Amcorp Trade Centre in
Petaling Jaya, which is now 100 per cent-owned by Amcorp.
  The other is South Peninsular Industries Bhd, a manufacturing company
listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) second board, which is
presently a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of the group.
  Azman says growth within AMMB Holdings Bhd, which led the financial
services sector of the group, continued to be significant. Among the
developments is the commencement of offshore banking operation in Labuan.
  Elsewhere, Arab-Malaysian Securities Holding Sdn Bhd expanded its
operations to Indonesia when it acquired a 60 per cent stake in Jakarta-
based stockbroking firm, now renamed PT Arab-Malaysian Capital Indonesia.
The group, through a subsidiary company, has also acquired a seat on The
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.
  Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, which obtained Tier-1 status and the
approval from Bank Negara to open four more branches, has entered into an
asset management joint-venture agreement with Macquarie Bank Ltd of
Australia.
  Closer to home, AMMB Futures Sdn Bhd began operations trading in futures
contracts on the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange and
the Malaysia Monetary Exchange. Meanwhile, Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd and
Arab-Malaysian Bank Bhd has also received approvals from the Central Bank
to open nine and eight new branches respectively.
  Azman says the growth prospect of the Malaysian economy is expected to
create increased loan demand which will provide lending opportunities for
the AMMB Holdings group. Likewise, activities in the capital markets will
remain robust, in line with Government's objective of promoting Kuala
Lumpur as a regional financial hub.
  "Thus, the group is poised to harness further opportunities arising in
the forthcoming year," says the chairman.
  Other significant events include the listing of Powertek Bhd, in which
Arab-Malaysian Development Bhd has a 30 per cent stake, on the main board
of the KLSE. Azman says this is notable as it is the first independent
power producer and first new infrastructure project company to be listed.
  For the year ended March 31 1996, the Amcorp group registered a profit
before tax of RM321.9 million, which shows a growth of 38.6 per cent.
Profits from Amcorp's own activities, comprising financial services and
property construction and development, surged by 79.3 per cent to RM87.7
million.

Marina Cove"s RM100m project

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Meera T'Ratnam

MALACCA-bound Marina Cove which will be built on a 35-acre coastal site at
the Kuala Linggi riverine estuary joins the latest string of waterfront
development projects to take off this  year.
  Construction for the RM100 million integrated waterfront property is set
for December this year. The project will be developed by Harvest Rimba
Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of public listed Harvest Court Industries Bhd.
  The development, which is projected to be completed by 1999 is situated
close to Port Dickson and the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
Sepang.
  "We are very pleased and excited to be developing this project in
Malacca given the state's historical ties with the sea. With the
development of Marina Cove, we hope to generate local interest in yatching
and other related activities," director of Harvest Rimba Sdn Bhd, Encik
Abdul Halim Yunus said.
  "The main attractions of the cove lie in its low resident per acre
density, exclusive home designs and its own private marina berthing
facilities," he said, in a statement.
  "These factors, together with pleasant surroundings and world-class
marina facilities make it a high value investment."
  Marina Cove waterfront project, which was launched a few days ago by the
Chief Minister of Malacca Datuk Seri Haji Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani, will
comprise of bungalows, townhouses, apartments, shops, hotel apartments, a
clubhouse with marine facilities and a broadwalk.
  "Marina Cove will have the lowest resident density per acre in the
waterfront marina development segment. We will be developing only 12 units
per acre  compared to the industry average of 40 units per acre," said
Abdul Halim.
  "Because we want own ers and residents to enjoy the privacy and serenity
for their surroundings, we will be developing only 19.25 acres of the
alloted 35 acres of coastal land. The remaining acre is devoted to open
spaces and water ways," he said.
  On the developed area, a Marina Arcade comprising of 10 shoplots and a
16-storey Waterfront Apartel consisting of a 150 unit apartment hotel will
be built.
  On the residential side, Cove Apartments-made up of five different
blocks of either four or five storeys and only 176 apartments, will be
built. The company also plans to offer 80 units  of terraced townhouses
with private berthing facilities as part of its Waterfront Quay Terrace.
  "In other waterfront projects in Malaysia, private berthing facilities
are available only to bungalow owners. Marina Cove has extended this
exclusive facility to our terrace house owners because we want as many
residents as possible to enjoy the pleasure of yachting and boating," he
added.
  Some 20 bungalow lots are expected to be available to owners of
Waterfront Villas.

Malaysia an atrractive choice: Economist

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Meera T'Ratnam

WITH the outlook for both the Malaysian stock market and economy set to
improve considerably by year-end, Malaysia will be an attractive choice
for the astute investors wishing to bank in Asia, Jardine Fleming Pte's
Singapore-based economist Rajeev Malik says.
  Not only have fears of a fast-paced economy been allayed but purer
economic and political fundamentals, coupled with Malaysia's ease in
coping with this year's global electronics slowdown, are just some reasons
why Malaysia may win hands down in garnering economists' approval.
  "Until a few months ago investors were worried that Malaysian economy
was growing too rapidly. The economy was like a Kancil bounding with a
high centre of gravity," he said. "It raised fears it would topple coming
round the corner."
  "But it's made a very skillful turn, so much so the concern now in some
quarters is that softer external demand will cause a sharper-than-expected
slowdown," he said.
  In an interview with Business Times, Malik said some downward revision
of the government's own estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth -
previously set at 8.5 per cent - should be expected with the budget. The
budget is set to be tabled on October 25.
  Expectations of a sharp slowdown in GDP are quite unwarranted though, he
says. While the economy is moderating, its overall strength remains
robust. Malaysia's second quarter performance of 8.4 per cent was much
better than Singapore where half-year growth came in at a lower-than-
expected 7 per cent.
  Despite estimates that up to half of Malaysia's total exports are tied
up in electronics, the slowdown in electronics has hurt Malaysia far less
than other Asian tigers. The absence of lumpy imports has also contributed
to this year's trend of sharply falling trade figures, with exports
outpacing imports.
  "Malaysia's current account deficit for 1996 is already set to be much
lower than Thailand," he said. "Neither does it have to contend with a
hotbed of political and economic woes like Indonesia and Thailand."
  Malik expects real domestic demand to ease from 14.6 per cent to 10.1
per cent in 1996. He credits the central bank for steering the economy
without resorting to severe credit controls. Last year's budget brought
tighter controls on credit card users, higher taxes on real property gains
and foreign purchases of real estate, higher taxes on luxury cars and less
financing for car purchases.
  The central bank followed up with initiatives to free up interest rates
by introducing a new framework for calculating base lending rates; raising
the statutory reserves requirement twice; and, a healthy dose of moral
suasion.
  It may have taken some time for the slowdown to register but loan growth
has clearly eased. Though partly driven by a decline in lending to broad
property and consumption, Malik says it's happening across the board. "A
recent pick-up in property lending growth in no way bucks this trend," he
adds.
  On the longer-term horizon, Malik dispelled the need to agonise over the
loss of competitiveness issue hounding the coverage of Asian economies
lately. "Sure, the convergence theory that Asia is cheap is no more. But
it does not mean because costs are rising, foreign investors are shifting
their investments and moving out."
  On trend in Malaysia, a greater proportion of new investment in
manufacturing goes towards expanding existing operations, instead of
setting up new ventures but as Malik sees it, "It's part of a gradual
process that has to take place for Malaysia to become the capital of
value-added manufacturing operations".

"Shorties" to debut on KLSE today

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Jennifer Jacobs

TODAY, for the first time, the Malaysian stock market opens itself to
"shorties", the colloquialism for those who carry out short-selling, that
is "... selling shares one does not own in anticipation of buying them
back later at a lower price and profiting from the difference in price."
  Many foreign players, as well as professional traders, have long
commented that opening the market to short-selling is a crucial step in
the development of the Malaysian capital market as it will facilitate
hedging and arbitrage activities which are essential for the introduction
of stock options trading.
  What this roughly means is that one can either buy equities and short-
sell futures, thereby covering one's back if the market turns either
bullish or bearish or short-sell equities and buy futures contracts.
  With the introduction of short-selling, investors can also profit in a
bearish market.
  Short-selling is expected to increase the liquidity of the market
especially for the securities in the approved list. The list of 50
counters, released on Friday evening, came as a surprise to many who had
only expected some 20 to 30 counters initially to be on it.
  As at the end of last year, only 28 counters had met the relevant
criteria for short-selling, namely, an average daily market capitalisation
of RM2 billion for the past three months; at least 100 million shares in
public float; at least 2,000 registered shareholders; five years of
uninterrupted profit track record; and, an average monthly share volume of
more than 2 million for the past 12 months.
  These criteria had been drawn up to ensure that short-selling is not
allowed across the board but limited only to the "bluest of blue-chips".
  Of course, the Securities Commission, in approving the rules drawn up by
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), had added that the exchange has
the discretion to expand and change the list of approved securities as and
when deemed necessary.
  The exchange must have deemed it necessary right away because the list
included companies that are hardly blue, maybe a pale azure.
  The question, of course, is whether in "shorting the shares" investors
can actually manipulate the prices and push them down unnaturally, as it
is one thing to bet on the shares going down and another altogether in
forcing the counter down.
  The exchange, with this concern in mind, has introduced prescribed
limits to bring about an idealised form of short-selling.
  KLSE senior manager for marketing development S. Loganathan said the
exchange will suspend further short-selling for any period if the position
exceeds the amount that is desirable to public interest or if it is
detrimental to the counter.
  Every deal has to be reported to the KLSE at the end of the trading day
so that the exchange can disseminate the positions of the short-selling
done for the day.
  Direct deals are not allowed, meaning no off-market deals between the
dealer and the client.
  And only stockbroking companies which have in place approved written
guidelines on "Know Your Customers" practices will be permitted to engage
in regulated short-selling.
  Investors seeking to engage in regulated short-selling must be fully
aware of the risk and have the financial capacity to meet their financial
commitments. Which basically means as in all other types of trading: "If
you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen."
  Professional traders used to the liberality of the more matured markets
may find these safeguards rather draconian and unnecessary, but they
should bear in mind the highly speculative image of the KLSE, especially
the second board, where speculators have had a field day in pushing up
stocks as the fancy takes them.
  The exchange, which has been trying to fight off this image, would be
loath to put yet another toy into the hands of these gamblers.
  However, all in all, short-selling is essential for the maturity of the
capital market and regulated short-selling protects the market from
possible foul play, so maybe this will be one market that can have its
cake and eat it.

Resolve problems within party, advises Dr M

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Jimmy Yeow

PRIME Minister and Barisan Nasional chairman Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad has urged members from the Barisan component parties not to go to
court to solve their internal disputes.
  He said while it is common to have differences in opinions between
members, they should try to resolve their problems within the party.
  Dr Mahathir said there will be no end to the culture of members seeking
legal action if members persist in doing so.
  "Today it will at the party's central committee level, tomorrow
divisional and branches."
  For example, he said even if a member succeeds in getting the court to
declare him or her as the party leader, it would not help if the majority
of the members reject his or her leadership.
  "There must be some form of compromise within the party.
  "If this cannot be achieved, the dispute should then be solved by the
political way of who is getting the most support from members," he told
reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz International Airport on his return
from New York yesterday.
  He was asked to comment on the political tussle between Parti Gerakan
president Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik and Gerakan member and member of
Parliament for Batu, Datuk Joseph Chong.
  Dr Mahathir said the dispute within Gerakan will not affect the Barisan
coalition and expressed confidence that the Gerakan members will be able
to resolve their problem among themselves.
  On Umno, Dr Mahathir said the special committee, headed by him, to
investigate complaints against disciplinary committee members for
allegedly breaching the no-campaign ruling is keeping an eye on the
conduct of the candidates.
  "You will find out in time," he said to a question whether any of the
disciplinary committee member had breached the ruling.
  A total of 185 candidates has been declared eligible to contest in the
Umno party elections in October.
  On allegations that some candidates are using their official functions
as a  "platform to campaign" by opening two or three functions a day, the
Prime Minister said the bunching of some of these functions could not
avoided.
  "But I hope the delegates will be able to judge for themselves the
motives of these functions," Dr Mahathir said.

Act now to ensure sufficient supply (HL)

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

THE construction industry's strong run may falter if measures are not
taken to ensure sufficient supply of basic building materials, according
to findings of a study prepared for the Ministry of Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs.
  At least six basic materials critical to the industry are likely to be
short in supply before the year 2000.
  Clinker, the main component for making cement, is also on this list.
Supplies of marble, reinforcement steel, structural steel, and PVC pipes
are also not expected to be able to meet the industry's demand. The supply
of sanitary ware and fittings are expected to begin running short by 1999.
  Even materials which are expected to be in surplus could experience
"localised" shortages.
  The study investigated supply and demand trends of 15 building materials
since 1994 and produced a trend forecast up to the year 2000.
  Expansion plans, existing production capacities, imports and exports
were also analysed in studying future trends for the building materials.
  The study was conducted by Arthur Andersen HRM (Management Services) Sdn
Bhd in association with the Quantity Surveyor Malaysia. It is the first
report prepared for the Goverment which covers the aspect of basic
building materials.
  The 15 materials included in the report are cement, carpentry and
joinery timber, aggregates and crusher-run, marble tiles, ceramic tiles,
bricks, reinforcement steel, structural steel, sand, roofing materials,
uPVC pipes, cast iron pipes, concrete pipes, sanitary wares and fittings
and timber of formwork (plywood and timber remnants).
  The construction sector is forecast to grow at an average rate of 7.5
per cent a year.
  Clinker is likely to be short in supply up to the end of the year. Even
at 90 per cent production capacity, local manufaturers are only expected
to churn out 9.9 million tonnes of clinker this year. Domestic demand
however is forecast to be 10.7 million tonnes.
  Clinker is a major semi-finished product used in the production of
cement. Production of a tonne of cement requires a 0.95 tonne input of
clinker.
  Last year, local clinker production was only 7.7 million tonnes which
was only about 83.7 per cent of the required 9.9 million tonnes, thus
causing a supply deficit of 2.2 million tonnes.
  Local cement producers will continue to source clinker from South Korea,
Japan, Thailand and Indonesia until the shortage, which has been occuring
since 1991, begin to ease later next year, the report said.
  The study forecasts a 1,000 tonne surplus of clinker next year.
  The situation will further improve in 1998 with a surplus of 3.2 million
tonnes but dropped to 2.9 million tonnes in 1999 and 2.1 million tonnes in
the year 2000.
  The cement industry, as a whole, is involved in a production expansion
programme from 13 million tonnes in 1995 to 21.87 million tonnes by the
year 2000. The Malaysian Cement Industry's 1995 Report showed that the
demand for cement last year was 12.1 million for Peninsular Malaysia and
1.35 million tonnes for Sabah and Sarawak.
  In the case of marble wall and floor tiles, the report said that with
its current production at 52 per cent capacity, shortages can be expected
right up to the year 2000 and beyond. However, the shortage may be delayed
at least until 1999 if production runs at full capacity. The report
suggested that the authorities look at the possibility of imports to meet
the rising demand.
  For reinforcement steel, the report forecast a shortage of 29,000 tonnes
next year which will reach 430,000 tonnes, or more than a quarter of the
total demand, in 2000.
  In the case of structural steel, the shortage since 1994 is expected to
last until the end of the decade despite increases in production capacity.
The authorities have been urged to introduce new incentives to attract new
investments to the sector.
  Demand for sanitary ware and fittings grew between 1988 and 1993 but
supply has been able to meet the industry demand. At 85 per cent
production capacity, the industry is expected to face a shortage by the
year 1999.
  The uPVC pipes are substitutes for cast iron and concrete pipes and are
mainly imported. Since the early 1980s, local production capacity has not
been able to meet the requirements of the local market. This is not
expected to change during the period under review.
  The study also highlighted manpower shortages in the respective
industries producing the building materials. Inefficient transport
services, quality of materials, and pricing were also discussed.

Smooth start for self-service at selected Caltex petrol stations

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 2

SELF-service for motorists at Caltex Oil petrol stations seems set to have
a smooth introduction with the company offering self-serve educational
programmes for motorists at three sites.
  The three selected petrol stations, located in the Klang Valley, have
been positioned with a group of trained experts known as customer service
assistants to help motorists get comfortable with the idea of serving
themselves.
  "We are committed towards addressing the labour issues that are plaguing
the country, especially with the issue of foreign labour at the
forecourts," chairman and managing director of Caltex Oil (M) Ltd, Mr.
Robert J. Gregory said in Kuala Lumpur.
  "As with any change, there is bound to be some apprehension and we
believe the best solution is to help, prepare and educate the public to
get used to the various aspects of self-service," he said.
  The Meor Hisham station in Ampang began to offer self-service on
September 19, followed by F I Star and Kwang Hap Siang.
  The company has put in place a programme that incorporates various on-
site programmes for motorists. This is to familiarise them with the
concept of self-serve well before the Government mandated date for all
petrol stations to be on self-service by January 1, 1997.
  Trained customer service assistants will point out how to use user
friendly electronic facilities and to guide customers on payment methods
according to their choice of cash or card.
  In addition, Caltex Malaysia will also have an elite squad of trained
personnal who will be deployed to these self-serve test stations initially
and subsequently to the various self-serve test stations in residential
neighbourhoods.
  Tagged as the "Self service Support Squad" (SSS Squad), the squad will
be commissioned to provide additional support to customer service
personnel at petrol stations and introduce the do-it-yourself concept
whilst giving hands-on demonstrations on self-serve.
  Apart from investing in mobile labour squads, Caltex has also invested a
total of RM9 million on hardware, electronic and retail automation for
facilitating self-serve.
  Caltex has also set up a toll-free hotline at 800-3188 to handle
enquiries on self-serve.
  "We are confident that with our comprehensive programme, additional
features and unique services, Caltex Malaysia will take the lead for self-
serve," said Gregory. "We will also be joining the Government and other
oil industry members in the joint educational programmes that have been
planned." he added.

Ecodrill scores a first with oil well workover service

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 2

By Kang Siew Li

IN THE past, Malaysia had to depend on foreign-based workover service
contractors to put non-productive oil wells back into business, but
Ecodrill (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd has changed all that.
  In the middle of last year, the company purchased its own workover rig
for RM15 million and, in doing so, became the first Malaysian company to
provide full workover service.
  The rig, named "Merpati Cerah", was designed and partly built by
Ecodrill and is capable of "working over" or reconditioning 30-40 oil
wells a year and drilling up to 10,000ft, Ecodrill director Raj Narayanan
said in an interview with Business Times.
  "Unlike other rigs used in the oil and gas industry, this rig is easy to
dismantle and is designed to handle all heavy duty workover work except
pure drilling," he said.
  He believes the improved design will help the company's clients save
substantial amounts of money in conducting remedial operations to restore
production at problem wells.
  The company was awarded a major workover service contract worth RM11
million a year by a leading oil and gas company - Unocal Thailand, which
is a subsidiary of US-based Unocal Corp.
  "The initial contract period is for one-and-a-half years, but the deal
is expected to take between four and six years," Narayanan said.
Operations are expected to start in the middle of next month.
  The contract is viewed as a means to help Ecodrill realise its long-term
objective of becoming a regional integrated workover service company, he
said. The company is also negotiating similar deals with three other oil
companies in Brunei and Indonesia.
  "This, coupled with our approval as a local contracting arm under the
Vendor Development Programme of Petronas, should see the company operating
at least four workover rigs (inclusive of the existing one) by the year
1999," Narayanan said.
  Ecodrill hopes to have its subsequent rigs totally manufactured in
Malaysia.
  Besides workover services, the company is also actively involved in
providing technical training services.
  "We have successfully established a skills training centre in Miri,
Sarawak, known as Ecotech Training Centre and Technical Institute since
1990," Narayanan said.
  Established in 1988, Ecodrill is jointly owned by Narayanan (16 per
cent) and chairman Mej. (R) Mat Salleh Noor (84 per cent). "The initial
paid-up capital of the venture was RM25,000, which has since increased to
RM3 million."
  Narayanan said the company with 32 workers was set up to provide
consultancy services to the oil and gas industry in Malaysia and the Far
East region in the drilling, engineering, production and maintenance
areas.
  "Four years later, we started providing technical training in petroleum
and drilling engineering at the present Technical Institute," he added.
  "Miri was chosen because we saw tremendous potential growth in the area
at the time. We also wanted to go to an area where we felt we could
introduce certificate and diploma courses to people interested in the oil
and gas industry," he said.
  Plans are already under way to set up its first branch campus in Kuala
Lumpur next year.
  "We also intend to upgrade the Technical Institute to become a research
and development support centre, now that we have direct involvement in oil
production operations, as we own a workover rig," Narayanan said.
  "From there, we can move to the development of new products and
technologies," he added.
  Narayanan believes Ecodrill is now ready to export its services
regionally, particularly to Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam.
  Currently, Ecodrill's business totals some RM4 million a year which is
solely from the provision of training and consultancy services.
  "This year, we expect total business to increase to RM6 million from
training and consultancy services together with a small contribution
coming from workover services," Narayanan said.
  From next year onwards, with the Unocal Thailand contract in hand and
improvements at the Technical Institute, the company expects turnover to
reach RM18 million to RM20 million a year.
  "By 1999, we'll see turnover rising to RM60 million-RM70 million a
year," he said. "Workover services will eventually contribute 70 per cent
of total revenue while the remaining 30 per cent will be from training and
consultancy," he added.
  Narayanan estimated that in Malaysia, the workover business is worth
RM100 million a year. "We are not looking at monopolising the industry,
but we aim to secure between RM20 million and RM30 million worth of
services."

YOUTH and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Mohd Yassin says Automobile
Association of Malaysia (AAM) chairman Tunku Mudzaffar Tunku Mustapha has
written to him requesting that they meet with local motorsport officials
over alleged infighting and disputes within the affiliates. Speaking in
Subang yesterday after opening the national level "Jati Diri Budaya Belia"
programme, he said he will listen to their viewpoints and get an objective
picture of the situation. While Malaysia plans to host a Formula One event
in 1999, the Malaysian rounds of the Formula Asia series have been
cancelled and the International Automobile Federation has struck the Rally
of Malaysia off the Asia Pacific Championships Round next year.

MAH to "represent all hotel views"

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 3

By Kang Siew Li

MALAYSIA Association of Hotels (MAH) president Mazli Mohamed wants the
211-member body to be truly representative of the entire sector by getting
most, if not all, the nation's hoteliers to join MAH.
  "I don't want the association to be perceived as one that only looks
after the welfare of hotels in Kuala Lumpur just because it is based in
the capital," he told Business Times in Kuala Lumpur.
  Mazli who is also Holiday Inn (hotel operations/development) general
manager, has taken the first step by ensuring the association represents
the views of hotels across the board.
  "Our new management committee members comprise not only four- and five-
star hotels but also three-star operations as well," said Mazli, who has
taken over from Encik Azman Harun whose two-year term ended recently.
  Mazli wants the association to be more vocal in fighting for the
interests of hotels and the industry. MAH is currently seeking to lower
electricity charges which have gone up with the withdrawal of the 10 per
cent discount on electricity tariffs for the hotel sector.
  He said the hotel industry contributes substantially to the country's
total electricity consumption and that the average three- or four-star
hotel (with 200 to 300 rooms) in Kuala Lumpur spends about RM500,000 per
year on electricity.
  Tenaga Nasional Bhd is very aware of this and it has already raised
electricity charges considerably without giving prior notice, he said.
  The association has submitted a memorandum to Energy, Telecommunications
and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie in June to consider its claims but has
yet to receive a response.
  MAH, working together with the Government, is also looking into
ambiguities in sewerage and service charges, the Social Security
Organisation (Socso), the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and wages.
  "We have compiled these matters in a memorandum which has already been
sent to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim during a pre-budget dialogue session in Ipoh in July," he added.
  Mazli said the hotel industry is presently enjoying a boom, with hotel
occupancy rates at between 70 and 80 per cent.
  "At the end of next year, we'll see tremendous growth in hotels in the
country as the industry gears up to host the Commonwealth Games for the
first time," he explained.
  At present, there are about 55,000 hotel rooms in the country.
  The number is expected to reach 100,000 by the end of next year.
  On whether the hotel market will be saturated then, he says, this
largely "depends on how well we promote our country and how good our
economy will be".
  "Equally important is the location of a hotel. If a hotel is not
properly located, it may suffer with the onset of fierce competition," he
added.
  However, Mazli said one unavoidable problem is the shortage of skilled
workers and service staff.
  "This will inevitably lead to an uncontrolled increase in wages as
hotels fight for more staff to fill positions in their hotels. Each
(hotel) tends to offer more for similar posts," he explained.
  Because the market share for hotels is becoming smaller, Mazli said
hoteliers must now work hand in hand with the authorities to find ways and
means to bring in more visitors into the country.
  "I think we should not rely solely on the Government to bring in more
visitors. I believe hotels have got to do more," he said.
  He added that the association has been supporting the Government in all
its efforts to promote tourism in the country.
  Mazli said MAH is currently working with the Malaysian Association of
Tour and Travel Agents and the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board in
anticipation of the Asean Tourism Forum which will be held in Kuala Lumpur
in January next year.
  "The event will generate income and create more awareness of Malaysia's
tourism industry," he believes.
  "At the same time, the association is also looking at the meetings,
incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) sector.
  "This is one component of the tourism business that I think will
contribute major exchange earnings to the country in the long run," he
said, adding that business travellers have higher disposable incomes and
their length of stay is longer.
  Mazli said there is a need to build convention centres in Kuala Lumpur,
Penang and Kuantan so that business will be spread out evenly.
  According to him, the construction of the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport (KLIA) in Sepang marks the beginning of a new era, as "the new
airport means more airlines will be coming in, more visitors and more
business for the hotel industry".
                               

Pix: Mazli ... tremendous growth in hotels in the country.

Ordinary week but for 2nd board plunge

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 11

By Roziana Hamsawi

IT WOULD have been a rather uninteresting week if not for the "sad
incident" which befell  a majority of the second board stocks on Thursday,
leaving punters to shift their attention to cheaper main board stocks.
  Otherwise, the local bourse last week was mildly active on quite a
healthy number of shares traded, making it "generally uninteresting but
definitely not boring" according to one analyst.
  Despite the country's seven months' good trade figures, the market had
started out on a weak note last week, arising from the uncertainties in
the direction of US interest rates. The KLSE Composite Index, on Monday,
lost 4.09 points, closing at 1,126.51 while the second board index rose
1.35 points up to 608.48.
  On Wednesday, shares rose in active trade with strong gains registered
in index-linked stocks. It was an immediate reaction to the US Federal
Open Market Committee's decision to maintain interest rates at the current
level. The Composite Index closed 5.59 points higher at 1,129.31, while
the second board rose 16.62 points to 625.41.
  After a continuous upward movement in the second board index, Thursday
saw it tumble down 24.86 points or 3.98 per cent to 600.55. Although a
correction was expected, the fall on Thursday was due to concerns of
restrictions on second board stocks, imposed by some local stockbroking
firms. The KLCI, however remained steady, losing only half a point to
1,128.81.
  The last day of the week ended fairly mixed with the CI moving up 1.78
points at 1,130.59 while the second board index continued its downward
fall, breaching the 600-psychological level to end the week at 595.58. The
first time the second board index hit the 600 level was the Friday before
when it closed at 607.13.
  Overall last week, a total of some 1.647 billion shares were traded
worth RM14.258 billion compared to 1.781 billion shares worth RM15.006
billion the week before.
  About 914.247 million shares were traded on the main board valued at
RM6.681 billion, while the second board saw a total of 602.420 million
shares done worth RM7.114 billion.
  Analysts said for this week, the market is expected to move sideways,
with speculative main board stocks continuing to attract punters. Interest
in second board stocks, however will not cease, said one analyst.

Chart trend: Bourse set to be choppy with wide fluctuations

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 11

By Raymond

ACTIVITY on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) started on Monday with
blue-chips taking a back seat while play resumed among speculative stocks
on the second board.
  Negative trade figures which were reported did not have a significant
impact on the KLSE.
  Volatile trading on Tuesday saw second board stocks trading in an
erratic fashion.
  Stocks on the main board were not doing much either, one way or the
other.
  Heavy speculative buying on Wednesday pushed prices of small capital
stocks upwards.
  The overall market sentiment also improved with a new batch of stocks
which came into play.
  The volatile movement of second board stocks continued on Thursday, only
this time round, they were hammered by aggressive selling.
  The bearish situation was, however, cushioned by firm support for
selective main board stocks which registered good gains.
  Mixed trading was the order of the day on Friday. Market sentiment was
pulled down by cautious selling on second board stocks, while only the
situational issues on the main board were giving supportive play in the
market.
  For the week, second board stocks were again in the limelight for the
right and wrong reasons.
  The much expected correction came in to cool off the over speculation
which has taken the second board stocks to record highs.
  Market players who were caught on the high side would be licking their
wounds, but for medium- term investors, this correction is healthy.
  Sentiment wise, the KLSE is expected to be choppy with wild fluctuations
to remain a feature among second board stocks.
  The market minus the very speculative second board stocks is still
attractive in value terms and interest may just shift to main baord
counters.
  In the past couple of weeks, there has been a slow uptrend which has not
caught too much attention among main board counters.
  This gradual momentum has not produced anything spectacular but with
patience there is a high potential for lagging stocks to bring in the
rewards.
  On the technical front our short-term Timing Device has been on the
downtrend for the past eight trading sessions and currently the falling
pace has been steadily reduced in the past four sessions.
  It is quite possible that this short-term market barometer which is now
standing at -56.4 points, is preparing itself for a trend reversal
sometime this week.
  The first supporting level is at -119.2 points, failing which, it is
expected to have the second support at around the -300 point level.
  Our O/O Indicator has continued to go up but at a lesser pace.
  Until this rising market barometer is arrested, we will continue to
remain bullish and treat corrections such as the one we are now seeing as
a technical pullback, which are necessary for any rally in the market.
  Currently, breaking out of the overhead resistance at zero is vital to
the continuation of the bullish trend we are seeing.
  Failure to do so can lead to our market heading for a new serious
correction.BT O/O INDICATOR

The Kunta Kinte column: Maintain good name of country abroad

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 4

By Datuk A. Kadir Jasin in New York

NEW YORK: A prominent Malaysian businessman I met strolling on New York's
Fifth Avenue a couple of mornings ago excitedly told me that his managing
director was in the Bahamas to attend the wedding reception of his nephew.
  He told me the story after I remarked that the Malays have come very far
from their rice farming days to be able to stay in the best hotels, shop
at the most fashionable stores and stroll leisurely on one of the most
fashionable streets of one of the largest cities in the world.
  And he was not alone and he may not have travelled on the supersonic
Concorde as some did. A whole group of Malaysia's most successful
businessmen descended on the city last week to join the Prime Minister,
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, at the United Nations.
  The fact that an untypically large group of Malaysian businessmen had
accompanied Dr Mahathir to the UN is explained by the fact that the Prime
Minister had earlier attended and addressed a business meeting organised
by the Asia Society.
  They could have joined the trip in deference to the Prime Minister and
the co-sponsor of the Asia Society dinner, Petronas.
  Having covered major international conferences around the world in which
Malaysian leaders have participated since the late 1970s - first for the
Business Times, then for Berita Harian and now the New Straits Times - I
can quite confidently say that our country has come a long way.
  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, only a handful of business people
would accompany the Prime Minister or his deputy on such trips. The
Bumiputera businessmen were the rarest.
  The Prime Minister or his deputy could count themselves lucky if they
had more than the usual group of journalists from Radio and Television
Malaysia, Bernama and the few large newspapers accompanying them.
  Businessmen almost invariably did not consider accompanying the Prime
Minister on international trips a fruitful business. Officials, too, did
not find it appropriate to invite them to join him on his official tours.
  Malaysia Incorporated was still many years away and the likes of Tan Sri
Tajudin Ramli, Tan Sri Halim Saad and Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Hussain were
still in the backrooms learning the tricks of the trade.
  Even dealmakers Tan Sri Vincent Tan, Datuk Francis Yeoh and the youthful
Datuk T.K. Lim were still in the background - shadowed by the likes of Tan
Sri Lim Goh Tong, Mr Robert Kuok and Datuk Tan Chin Nam.
  Tan Sri Kishu Jethanand of Globe Silk Store fame had already hit the big
time but had yet to develop an international profile, while Mr K. Ananda
Krishnan had the name but not the face. He had made his fortune in oil
and, being a graduate of Harvard University, was at ease with things
American.
  He is still a shy and highly private person. But like other successful
Malaysian businessmen, he too has been thrust onto the world stage by
Malaysia's unprecedented economic success in the last decade and by Dr
Matathir's Malaysia Incorported policy.
  In the early days, the media organisations were invited to send
journalists to cover the Prime Minister's visit abroad and their expenses
were often borne by the Government. This practice was stopped by the late
Tun Hussein Onn when he became Prime Minister in 1976.
  Fortunately, since media organisations also benefit from the rapid
economic growth, they can continue to send journalists on overseas
assigments at their own expense.
  When I was first sent to New York for assignment, the best hotel the
Business Times could offer was The Tudor, which in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, charged US$70 a day (US$1 = RM2.51). Today, even middle-level
journalists stay at St Regis together with the Prime Minister.
  Times have certainly changed. But the bigger change is in the way the
Government and businesses are collaborating to strengthen the country's
position on the global political and economic map.
  For this very important reason, it is contemptible that we find some
Malaysian companies and businessmen showing tendencies of becoming
arrogant and insincere in their dealings with the outside world,
especially the poorer countries.
  I think it is the collective responsibility and moral obligation of
Malaysian businessmen, especially those enjoying the privilege of being
included in the Prime Minister's entourage, not to do things that will
tarnish the good name of the country and its leaders.
  It is alright for them to take pride in telling people that they are
accompanying the Prime Minister or his deputy, especially if it helps to
open doors. But they must make sure that they announce the Prime
Minister's name at the appropriate door.
  Those who misbehave, even in front of a United Nations security guard or
a hotel clerk, should be hauled up and spoken to by those responsible for
including them in the Prime Minister's entourage.
  Kurang ajar and arrogance should not be made our trademark. If they are
not known to have good manners (including table manners), they should be
given proper briefings before they are let loose on the world as members
of the Prime Minister's entourage.
  Although some Malaysians can travel all the way from Kuala Lumpur to the
Bahamas to attend wedding receptions and their children's graduation or
are picked up in a private jet to go on a gambling trip to Las Vegas, we
should avoid behaving like kaduk naik junjung. We should try to be like
padi, semakin berisi semakin tunduk.

Prices end lower on US rates fear

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 12

SINGAPORE blue-chip stocks closed last week 0.8 per cent lower on Friday
amid an absence of local and overseas incentives after fears of a US
interest-rate rise were disproved.
  The Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) ended the week 16.81 points
down at 2,171.05. The broader All-Singapore index was 2.35 points lower to
529.17.
  Dealers said the market was expected to trade in a narrow range in the
near term, but added that the start of October could see some programmed
buying by institutional investors.
  Average daily turnover fell to 68.79 million shares worth S$187.46
million.
  The week opened on a quiet note with investors trying to digest the
release of lower-than-expected August trade data and awaiting the Federal
Reserve's decision on interest rates.
  Creative was still the top gainer, its share price recording an absolute
increase for the week of S$1.95 to S$7.95.

Stocks rise as US rate jitters ease

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 13

SHARE prices rose 1.4 per cent over the week to Friday as the futures
market gained after the US federal reserve left interest rates untouched
mid-week, dealers said.
  The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index gained 167.03
points last week to finish at 11,759.39 on Friday.
  Average daily turnover amounted to HK$6.2 billion, down from the
previous week's HK$7.158 billion dollars.
  The market rose on blue-chip buys, up 29.77 points last Monday. It lost
75.43 points on Tuesday on rate jitters but recovered 0.5 per cent on
Wednesday and a further 32.60 points on Thursday.
  Friday saw the biggest gain of the week with the Hang Seng up 123.26
points.

Mart ends mixed on FOMC move

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Public Bank Treasury Division

THE market's immediate reaction was mixed as to the surprise move by the
Fed to leave rates unchanged at the September 24 FOMC meeting. The Fed's
action gave the market a clearer direction for interest rates as the
week's economic data turned out mildly weak.
  Consumer confidence for September was down to 111.8 against August's
112.0 and August's existing homes was also down 0.02 million to 4.13
million. More significant was the durable goods for August which dropped
3.1 per cent against a 1.4 per cent increase the previous month.
  With this, rates eventually eased and they are expected to stay soft
next week until the next FOMC meeting in November.

Rates expected to close firmer this week

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Bank Bumiputra Treasury Division

INTERBANK money rates closed firmer as players borrowed the short- to
medium-term money for the settlement of the new bonds to be issued today.
  Shorter-end money rates rose higher while the longer-end closed steady
as covering activities were mostly centered on the short to medium tenors.
The highlight of the week was the tender result of the new bonds issue
which was announced on Friday afternoon.
  The 7-year MGS 2/96 coupon, fixed at 6.586 per cent, rallied after the
result to a high of RM100.60 as short covering activities took place. It
settled at RM100.33/35 in active trading.
  Even though the market was still flush with excess liquidity, term money
rates were pushed up in anticipation of a tighter market next week as
there will be an outflow of RM2.0 billion being payment for the new bonds
issue.
  The benchmark one, three and six months closed higher at 7.25/30 per
cent, 7.30/35 per cent and 7.33/35 per cent respectively.
  While one, two and three weeks money closed above 7.00 per cent as
dealers did not want to be caught short next week.
  The new MGS 2/96 bonds showed a big jump as the yield was depressed to
as low as 6.48 per cent after the announcement compared to 6.60/58 per
cent when it was traded in the grey market. It however retraced to close
the week at a 6.53 per cent yield (price RM100.33/35).
  There was no Bank Negara bills issue during the week forcing some banks
who were short on their liquid assets requirement to buy up Bank Negara
bills in the secondary market.
  As a result the band 4 (68 to 91 days) Bank Negara Bills dropped to
6.65/63 per cent at closing compared to the last tender result average
which was at 6.728 per cent.
  For this week, we expect rates to tighten temporarily due to the payment
of the RM2.0 billion for the new bonds.

Money talk: Investors surprised by Fed decision

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Bank of America Treasury Division

EARLIER last week, speculation of whether the US Federal Reserve will
increase interest rates during the FOMC meeting had preoccupied the
foreign exchange market.
  However, the market was caught by surprise with the Fed's decision to
leave interest rates unchanged, prompting fresh concerns about rising
inflation. The FOMC voted against raising short-term rates, even though a
majority of analysts had predicted a modest 25 basis points increase.
  Currency investors that had banked on a rate increase sold the US dollar
from 1.5140 to 1.50  marks, with strong support seen intact at 1.4980.
Some dealers blamed politics for delaying a much-needed interest rate
increase, with the pressure of Presidential and Congressional elections in
November.
  By the end of the week, the market witnessed a steady bid interest on
the US dollar after a surprising Swiss interest rate cut. Switzerland cut
its discount rate to an 18-year low of 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent and
investors fled the Swiss franc and the mark . Investors appear to have
forgotten their dissapointment with the Fed's decision to keep interest
rates untouched. The market is also expecting lower interest rates in
Germany in the coming months. The market has also turned a blind eye to
the dissolution of the Japanese Parliament's Lower House.  The market
closed at 1.5240 amd 110.70 against the mark and the yen respectively.
  As for next week, the market is vulnerable to all US indicators in the
run-up to the key non-farm payroll on Friday. Some analysts believe that
the US asset markets are currently hyper-sensitive to all kinds of rates
and so the US dollar could be on its guard. Others express concern that
the US dollar is gaining its strength mainly from external factors. The US
dollar will require fresh internal incentives/factors to rise above its
current key resistance level of 1.5250 marks.
  As for the local unit, the ringgit fell to the 2.51 level on fresh US
dollar demand ahead of the month-end requirements from commercials and
also due to heavy stop losses orders being triggered as the market
approaches the 2.51 level. The market is expected to be traded between
2.5050 and  2.5125 for next week.
  As for the Asian currencies, we expect the Singapore dollar/ringgit  to
trade between the 1.7750 and 1.7880 range and  the yen/ringgit between
2.2500 to 2.2800.

assumed on our part for error of facts and opinions.)

Hope for a city struggling for survival

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 4

By Leela Barrock in Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH: There was a loud sound. The car dipped and then appeared to
levitate. A harsh gasp broke the startled silence as the passengers
waited, almost expectantly, in the split second for the bang ... There was
a dull thud and then the silence was broken by an apologetic giggle.
  "Sorry, pothole," the driver said. A regular journey through the streets
of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
  This is a city of contradictions. The traveller first meets what must be
a collection of the nicest Customs officers in the world, as they
apologise for having to check your luggage and then actually help you to
put your things back.
  Having been lulled into a false sense of security that all the
literature on the gentle Cambodian people is true, the weary traveller
sets foot outside Pochentong International Airport, only to be accosted by
a large crowd of deafeningly aggressive taxi drivers. They stick their
faces in yours and holler at the top of their voices: "Taxi, madam".
  If it is not the taxi drivers, then it is self-styled porters who try to
grab your bags and rush off in any direction they think you want to go.
Saying "No" is of no help.
  After locating your vehicle, they will shove everything into the boot
without a thought given to the fact that you may be blanching in shock at
the sound of breaking bottles of sambal belachan and Lee Kum Kee oyster
sauce. The inevitable tip is asked for. You could get away with a 500 riel
tip (about 50 sen) although if you do not have riels, US$1 (2,500 riels)
will get you a princely bow.
  Once safely in the car, the next shock hits you: there are no street
lights in most parts of Phnom Penh. This adds a new dimension to the
meaning of the phrase "pitch dark".
  Then, comes contradiction number two in the glaring and almost
decadently bright shape and form of Monivong Boulevard, one of the main
streets in the city.
  Almost every shop is adorned with colourful lights, and neon signs blink
away the darkness announcing the presence of massage parlours, snooker
parlours and parlours where one can do any number of parlour-like things.
This is the world of Suzie Wong - on a smaller scale and without the
American GIs.
  In the glaring daylight, however, Monivong is a lot less colourful. It
is shrouded in a perpetual cloud of dust that seems to hang over the whole
country and choke and cloak everything. The facades of the shops and
stores without the cover of night, are no more inviting than the "rumah
tumpangan" in Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur.
  A quick whizz around Phnom Penh, and this city-bred Malaysian had parted
with a fortune in US dollars to what appeared to be society's downtrodden.
Beggars come at you from all sides and do not mind pinching conveniently
exposed parts of your body to attract attention. Most of them are
heartrendingly incapacitated, lacking in at least one limb, usually more.
  These are just a small part of the thousands of mine victims in
Cambodia, struggling to make a living in a country where even the fit,
hale and hearty have a tough time making ends meet. The only other two
places in the world where I have seen these many beggars are India and the
London underground.
  By lunchtime, several dollars poorer, wearing a cloak of dust and
parched from the dry heat of the city's "rainy season", we stepped into a
"Pizza Hot" restaurant. The logo is a mirror of the more well-known Pizza
Hut's red and white. The food is not that much different - a tad more
international than the Malaysianised fare in Kuala Lumpur's Pizza Huts.
  Suddenly overcome by a fit of homesickness, I decided to find that
accoutrement of most homesick Malaysians - Maggi Mee. Choosing the fastest
means of transport, I hopped on to a "moto dop" (motorcycle which doubles
as a taxi) and whizzed away, past the slower "cyclos" (trishaws).
  Whizzing with me were whole families of five or six, perched on
motorcycles. There were also the odd motorcycle balancing a mattress or
two, or with furniture strapped high on the back seat. I ogled at them and
the Cambodians ogled back at me, for I was the only woman sitting astride
a motorcycle, hanging on for dear life to the rider.
  The other women all sit side-saddle and do not come into any physical
contact with the riders. During the war years, apparently men too were
required by law to sit side-saddle on motorcycles because this made hand-
grenade throwing more difficult.
  In a local supermarket catering for expatriates, I found Maggi Mee. It
was also here that I encountered Cambodian directness.
  "Madam come from where?" a sales assistant asked me.
  "Malaysia."
  "Madam how old?"
  Looking as mortified as I felt, I decided to pander to this peculiar
outrightness. "Madam, 29 years old."
  "Ah ... " (She looked surprised). "I think Madam sirty fife," she said,
driving the point home by holding her hands up to show three and five
fingers.
  I left the store bemused and amused, armed with a packet of curry laksa
flavoured Maggi Mee which cost 25 US cents. Also in my grocery bag was a
packet of cigarettes which cost US$1, a bottle of Angkor beer for 80 US
cents and a French loaf for 30 US cents.
  Grabbing a newspaper for 1,000 riels, I walked out of the store to read
the first person account of a Khmer Rouge deserter on life with the
notorious Pol Pot leader of the guerrilla faction, which had stayed in
power in the country from 1975 to 1979.
  Almost 20 years after the Khmer Rouge were overthrown, their legacy
remains in the broken families, the shattered dreams of the people, their
crushed city, the homeless children, the bomb craters dotting the
countryside, and ruined lives.
  That night, after a packet of Maggi Mee and sitting in the balmy night
breeze of my villa (read this as semi-detached house), I noticed the smell
of Phnom Penh was finally overpowered by the large "mata kucing" tree in
my front garden.
  Phnom Penh smells like a growing child - of food, sweat and hope.
  And it is this hope that is most infectious. I found myself hoping that
the Khmer Rouge will surrender and that complete peace will be restored to
this still tragic country, that those of my generation who have known not
much more than a life of war and deprivation will be the last to know such
a life.
  The gentle smiles from the older generation of Cambodians are no longer
mirrored in the younger folks. It is this gentleness that could be the
