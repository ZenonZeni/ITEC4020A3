<H1>Utilities</H1>
<H4>The Energy Foundation will support efforts to spread
regulatory and market models wherein a utility's most
profitable mix of power sources-energy efficiency,
renewable energy, and fossil fuel power plants-is the
one with the lowest long-term costs. The foundation is
particularly concerned that consumers and low-income
constituents be represented in this process.</H4>

Power generation by electric utilities in the United
States takes a severe toll on the environment. U.S.
power plants discharge two-thirds of the country's
sulfur dioxide emissions, one-third of its carbon
dioxide emissions, one-third of its nitrogen oxide
emissions, and half of its nuclear waste. To compound
these problems, rising use of electricity, up 3 percent
in 1994, is creating demand for new fossil-fuel plants.
<P>
Energy-efficient alternatives in this sector are
particularly compelling. The Electric Power Research
Institute estimates that 23 percent of all U.S.
electricity consumption could be saved for less than 3
cents per kilowatt-hour-less than the cost of generating
that electricity. Over time, between a third and a half
of U.S. electricity consumption could be saved through
energy efficiency. Electric utilities, given proper
incentives, could finance these improvements for
industrial, commercial, and residential consumers. 
<P>
In New England, New York, California, Wisconsin, and the
Pacific Northwest, pioneering reforms in utility
regulation have made it profitable for utility companies
to meet electricity demand through energy efficiency
rather than through power plant construction. Both
consumers and utilities benefit from these investments,
establishing a 'win-win' collaboration among utilities,
businesses, consumers, and environmentalists.
