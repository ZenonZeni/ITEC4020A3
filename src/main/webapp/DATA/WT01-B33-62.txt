<ul>
    <li>&quot;The American crack experience is fairly well known,
        having been reported, and perhaps overreported, in the
        media since early 1986&quot; (Inciardi, 1993, p. 1). </li>
    <li>&quot;As asset forfeiture provisions, RICO [Racketeering
        Influenced and Corrupt Organizations] and CCE [Continuing
        Criminal Enterprise statute] mandate forfeiture of the
        fruits of criminal activities&quot; (Inciardi, 1993, p.
        1). </li>
    <li>&quot;At state and local levels, zero tolerance gave
        birth to the many 'user accountability' statutes. User
        accountability was based on the notion that if there were
        no drug users there would be no drug problems and that
        casual users of drugs, like addicts, were responsible for
        creating the demand that made trafficking in drugs a
        lucrative criminal enterprise. As such, the new laws
        called for mandatory penalties for those found in
        possession of small quantities of drugs (Inciardi, 1993,
        p. 2). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;The Federal Corrections Institute in Lexington,
        Atwood Hall Drug Abuse Program [AHDAP] is a traditional
        12-step program in which drug abuse is viewed as a
        disease that leads to physical deterioration, emotional
        instability, and spiritual bankruptcy&quot; (Wellisch,
        Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 11). </li>
    <li>Some of the requirements for admission to this program
        (AHDAP) are &quot;...no serious medical, psychiatric, or
        psychological problems; and no violent institutional
        infractions within the last 12 months&quot; (Wellisch,
        Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 11). </li>
    <li>Re: enrollment in treatment programs while
        incarcerated--&quot;Most authorities agree that too early
        enrollment may erode the gains made in treatment because
        the prisoners will remain in an environment--the
        prison--that is conductive to relapse&quot; (Wellisch,
        Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 21). </li>
    <li>&quot;Drug abuse treatment requires individuation and a
        degree of flexibility that is not consonant with most
        prison operations&quot; (Wellisch, Anglin, &amp;
        Prendergast, 1993, p. 21). </li>
    <li>&quot;Because dependence on drugs is a chronically
        relapsing condition, in most cases several cycles of
        treatment, aftercare, and relapse will occur&quot;
        (Wellisch, Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 22). </li>
    <li>&quot;...since a large percentage of incarcerated women
        have been subjected to physical and sexual abuse, they
        require counseling and psychological support in addition
        to general health care&quot; (Wellisch, Anglin, &amp;
        Prendergast, 1993, p. 24). </li>

    <li>&quot;There are many phenomena in the prison environment
        that make rehabilitation difficult&quot; (Pan, Scarpitti,
        Inciardi, &amp; Lockwood, 1993, p. 34). </li>
    <li>&quot;Finally, there is the prison subculture--a system
        of norms and values that tend to militate against
        rehabilitation&quot; (Pan et al., 1993, p. 34). </li>

settings. In J. A. Inciardi (Ed.), <u>Drug treatment and criminal
justice</u> (pp. 44-80). Newbury Park: Sage Publications, Inc. </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Federal, state, and local responses to the drug
        epidemic have focused on reducing the supply of drugs
        through enhanced law enforcement efforts, minimum
        mandatory sentences for drug offenses, and unprecedented
        construction of new jails and prisons. Efforts aimed at
        drug suppliers and users have not succeeded in reducing
        the availability of drugs in most communities (Peters,
        1993, p. 45). </li>
    <li>&quot;The role of jails has expanded in the past 20 years
        to address the needs of special inmate populations,
        including substance abusers, the mentally ill, and
        individuals with educational and vocational deficits.
        These changes have been affected in part by the
        recognition that jails frequently serve as the repository
        for socially disadvantaged populations (e.g., mentally
        ill, substance abusers, the homeless) that move somewhat
        fluidly from one community institution to another&quot;
        (Peters, 1993, p. 46). </li>
    <li>&quot;Survey findings indicate that a small fraction of
        jail inmates in need of substance abuse treatment were
        receiving services (Peters, 1993, p.49). </li>
    <li>&quot;The CD [Chemical Dependency] approach views the
        development of addictive disorders as a product of
        physiological, psychological, and social factors. Inmates
        are taught that drug dependence is a lifetime disorder.
        During periods of abstinence, the 'disease' is in
        remission, but the individual must always be concerned
        with reoccurrence of symptoms&quot; (Peters, 1993, p.
        50). </li>
    <li>&quot;...narcotic agonists such as methadone, which
        replace the physiological need for opiates,...have been
        found to be useful in the treatment of offenders who are
        addicted to opiates&quot; (Peters, 1993, p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;Methadone treatments have been researched
        extensively and have been shown to be effective in
        reducing withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings&quot;
        (Peters, 1993, p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;Use of this approach [methadone] is usually
        reserved for individuals who have not been able to
        achieve abstinence in drug-free programs. Use of
        methadone is governed by federal regulations that require
        narcotic dependency for at least 1 year prior to the
        onset of treatment and previous involvement in treatment.
        Other federal guidelines require drug testing,
        counseling, and development of individualized treatment
        plans (Office of Technology Assessment, 1990). Several
        states have also adopted regulations governing dosage
        levels and quality assurance monitoring&quot; (Peters,
        1993, (p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;Methadone has been used infrequently in jail
        settings, because, in part, of a reluctance by
        administrators to provide narcotics to inmates and
        related issues of medical supervision and concerns of
        compromising institutional security&quot; (Peters, 1993,
        p. 52). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;As case studies have repeatedly pointed out, such
        stressful life events as divorce or loss of employment
        can play a critical role in precipitating a relapse to
        drug use&quot; (Martin &amp; Inciardi, 1993, p. 82). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Research has repeatedly found that criminal
        behavior increases following addiction, and that arrests
        for drug offenses and property offenses decline with
        decreasing frequency of drug use&quot; (Dembo, Williams,
        &amp; Schmeidler, 1993, p. 113). </li>
    <li>&quot;Methadone maintained clients have better outcomes
        in terms of illicit drug use and other criminal behavior
        than when not treated or detoxified and released or when
        methadone is tapered down and terminated. Clients who
        stay in treatment longer have better outcomes than
        clients with shorter treatment courses&quot; (Dembo,
        Williams, &amp; Schmeidler, 1993, p. 116). </li>
    <li>&quot;It is counterproductive to treat youths in
        residential settings, only to return them unassisted to
        environments that supported their problem behavior in the
        past&quot; (Dembo, Williams, &amp; Schmeidler, 1993, p.
        119). </li>
    <li>&quot;In treating a person for dysfunctional drug use, it
        is important to appreciate that altering a drug-dependent
        existence is often a prolonged process involving periodic
        relapses to drug use&quot; (Dembo, Williams, &amp;
        Schmeidler, 1993, p. 121). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Addicts who are fortunate enough to have been well
        educated, have steady incomes, and good social support
        and thus do not need to turn to crime to support their
        addictions, often experience...problems with relapse. The
        fact that many [Treatment Alternative to Street Crimes]
        TASC clients more often than not have additional burdens
        and problems to overcome makes relapse even more
        understandable in their circumstances&quot; (Swartz,
        1993, p. 135). </li>

    <li>The <u>Atlanta Georgian</u>, 27 February 1935, ran a poem
        named 'The Jaws of Death' by George E. Phair: &quot;A
        slinking thing with hellish sting, The reptile known as
        Dope. </li>
</ul>

<p>Its poison breath is living death Beyond the pale of hope, </p>

<p>And in the blight of endless night Its countless victims
grope. </p>

<p>In stricken homes the reptile roams On hearthstones bare and
bleak. </p>

<p>Ambition dies in youthful eyes, Slain by the noxious reek. </p>

<p>For Dope is strong and prospers long Because the laws are
weak&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p. 20). </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;...Anslinger's crusade appears to have been the
        ravings of a madman. Using the mass media as his forum,
        Anslinger described marijuana as a Frankenstein drug that
        was stalking American youth&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p.
        22). </li>
    <li>In a magazine, he wrote: &quot;The sprawled body of a
        young girl lay crushed on the sidewalk the other day
        after a plunge from the fifth story of a Chicago
        apartment house. Everyone called it suicide, but actually
        it was murder. The killer was a narcotic known to America
        as marijuana, and to history as hashish. It is a narcotic
        used in the form of cigarettes, comparatively new to the
        United States and as dangerous as a coiled
        rattlesnake...(Inciardi, 1986, p. 22). </li>
    <li>The same magazine, <u>American Magazine</u>, ran this
        from Anslinger: &quot;An entire family was murdered by a
        youthful addict in Florida. When officers arrived at the
        home, they found the youth staggering about in a human
        slaughterhouse. With an ax he had killed his father,
        mother, two brothers, and a sister. He seemed to be in a
        daze....He had no recollection of having committed the
        multiple crime. <i>The officers knew him ordinarily as a
        sane, rather quiet young man; now he was pitifully
        crazed. </i>They sought the reason. The boy said that he
        had been in the habit of smoking something which youthful
        friends called &quot;muggles,&quot; a childish name for
        marihuana [sic]&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p. 22). </li>
    <li>&quot;Colored students at the Univ. of Minn. partying
        with female students (white), smoking (marijuana) and
        getting their sympathy with stories of racial
        persecution. Result pregnancy. Two Negroes took a girl
        fourteen years old and kept her for two days under the
        influence of marihuana [sic]. Upon recovery she was found
        to be suffering from syphilis&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p.
        22). </li>
    <li>&quot;During the early decades of the twentieth century,
        commentaries about cocaine took on racial overtones,
        precipitated by white fears of the blacks' sexual and
        criminal impulses. In 1910, for example, testimony before
        a committee of the House of Representatives referenced
        these fears and also included almost every white
        stereotype of blacks: The colored people seem to have a
        weakness for it [cocaine]. It is a very seductive drug,
        and it produces extreme exhilaration. Persons under the
        influences on it believe they are millionaires. They have
        an exaggerated ego. They imagine they can lift this
        building, if they want to, or can do anything they want
        to. They have no regard for right or wrong. It produces a
        kind of temporary insanity. They would just as leave rape
        a woman as anything else and a great many of the southern
        rape cases have been traced to cocaine&quot; (Inciardi,
        1986, p. 72). </li>
    <li>&quot;Indeed, heroin is a powerful narcotic. Several
        times more potent than morphine, it suppresses both
        respiratory and cardiovascular activity, has strong
        analgesic effects and a high-addiction potential. At
        overdose levels, heroin can produce coma, shock, and
        ultimately, respiratory arrest and death&quot; (Inciardi,
        1986, p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;As the result of Anslinger's crusade, on August 2,
        1937, the Marijuana Tax Act was signed into law,
        classifying the scraggly tramp of the vegetable world as
        a narcotic and placing it under essentially the same
        controls as the Harrison Act had done with opium and coca
        products&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p. 23). </li>
    <li>Inciardi (1986, p. 204) criticizes psychiatrist Thomas
        Szasz's point that &quot;...the drug problem in America
        was created in great part by the very policies designed
        to control it&quot; by saying that in Szasz's book there
        were &quot;numerous errors of fact combined with his
        caustic abuse of the English language.&quot; Likewise,
        Inciardi (1986, p. 204) does not agree with Washington
        attorney Rufus King who takes a similar view and has
        described American drug-control policies as &quot;a
        50-year folly, a misguided and ineffective
        endeavor.&quot;<sup> </sup><b><i>make footnote: 50-year
        folly--Rufus King, </i></b><i><u>The Drug Hang-Up:
        America's Fifty-Year Folly</u></i><i> (New York: W. W.
        Norton, 1972). </i>Again disagreeing, Inciardi (1986,
        p.204) quotes Alfred R. Lindesmith from an article in <u>The
        Nation:</u> </li>
</ul>

<p>For 40 years the United States has tried in vain to control
the problem of drug addiction by prohibition and police
suppression. The disastrous consequences of turning over to the
police what is an essentially medical problem are steadily
becoming more apparent as narcotic arrests rise each year to new
records and the habit continues to spread, especially among young
persons. Control by prohibition has failed; but the proposed
remedies for this failure consist mainly of more of the same
measures which have already proved futile. </p>

<p>Inciardi (1986, pp.204-206) lumps these social scientists
together and dismisses them as &quot;armchair crusaders who had
little direct contact with life in the street worlds of heroin,
cocaine, and crime [who]....suggest that federal drug policies
are simply an outgrowth of the government's practiced benign
stupidity.&quot; </p>

<ul>
    <li>In contrast with those views, Inciardi (1986, pp.204-205)
        defines and disagrees with the Marxist perspective of
        Criminologists D. Stanley Eitzen and Doug A. Timmer
        &quot;that the American approach is deliberately
        structured to fail because the political economy of the
        United States needs the private accumulation of capital
        and profit that drug trafficking provides. For that
        reason, they state, the drug trades are not only
        tolerated, but condoned as well.&quot; Criminologists
        Eitzen and Timmer are dismissed by Inciardi (1986, p.
        205) because he believes they &quot;read far too much
        into an erroneously documented statement&quot; by William
        J. Chambliss in <u>On the Take</u>: </li>
</ul>

<p>...the heroin traffic from Southeast Asia, especially from the
Golden Triangle of northern Thailand, Burma, and Laos, expanded
production as a new source of heroin for the incredibly lucrative
American market....It is not known whether this new heroin source
was linked to Republican politicians, but the fact that the CIA
and the South Vietnamese governments under general Ky and Thieu
actively aided the development of this heroin source suggests
that such a link is not beyond the realm of possibility. </p>

<p>Inciardi (1986, p. 205) scoffs at the translation of
&quot;this into the 'private accumulation of capital and
profit'&quot; argument but does accept the conclusion of Alfred
W. McCoy in <u>The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia</u>
&quot;that the heroin trade in Southeast Asia grew to some extent
with the complicity of the U.S. government representatives in
that part of the world...[due to] American anticommunist
zeal.&quot; </p>

<ul>
    <li>Ask Dr. Brown about the Iran-Contra coverup movie we saw
        about Oliver North, Reagan, etc. Doesn't that give more
        credence to the Marxist perspective of Eitzen and Timmer?
    </li>
    <li>It is absolutely amazing to me how many of our rights we
        are willing to give up in the off chance that we can put
        a dent in the drug problem. &quot;Ignorant men don't know
        what good they hold in their hands until they've flung it
        away&quot; (Sophocles). </li>
    <li>&quot;Dr. William Pollin, former director of the National
        Institute on Drug Abuse:...If there were no law
        enforcement, then the number of cocaine users would be up
        there in the same numbers with smokers and drinkers&quot;
        (Inciardi, 1986, p. 211). Pray tell, how does he know? It
        is inconceivable that those who demand scientific studies
        and well-documented evidence insist on using these
        off-the-wall quotes regarding something that no one knows
        for certain is going to happen. </li>

    <li>&quot;...ambitious lawmakers and empire-building
        policemen appear to have created social attitudes instead
        of, as the system is supposed to work, merely reflecting
        and responding to them&quot; (King, 1974, p.18). </li>
    <li>&quot;During the Civil War opium and morphine were in
        such demand to control dysentery and ease the suffering
        of wounded soldiers that addiction among veterans was
        tolerantly known as 'the Army disease&quot; (King, 1974,
        p.18). </li>
    <li>In the early 1900s, the approximately 200,000
        &quot;victims [of addiction] were believed to be
        preponderantly female, middle-aged, white, Southern,
        rural, and from privileged or middle classes. No one then
        dreamed of associating drug abuse with criminality&quot;
        (King, 1974, pp. 18-19). </li>
    <li>The Food and Drug Act of 1906 &quot;...required drug
        manufacturers who made use of interstate commerce to
        disclose the ingredients in their products by appropriate
        labeling&quot; (King, 1974, p. 19). </li>
    <li>In the meantime, China lost the Opium Wars and
        &quot;...according to one estimate, 27 percent of the
        adult male population of the country was addicted in some
        degree&quot; (King, 1974, p. 19). </li>
    <li>&quot;On the other side of the world in Washington,
        Yankee lawmakers were being swept away by missionary and
        moralistic zeal...[and in 1908] President Theodore
        Roosevelt proposed that all powers concerned with the
        international opium traffic should meet to consider
        cooperative measures to put an end to it&quot; (King,
        1974, p. 20.) </li>
    <li>&quot;Out of this came the Shanghai Conference (1909) and
        the Hague Opium Convention, signed in 1912 by delegates
        from thirteen governments. Under this Convention...each
        High Contracting Party proposed to bind itself to
        restrain its nationals from trafficking in opium and coca
        products, and to impose domestic controls on its citizens
        to curb non-medicinal uses&quot; (King, 1974, p. 20). </li>
    <li>&quot;The first federal <i>control</i> enactment, the
        Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914...relied upon a then
        extraordinary extension of the federal tax power to
        require manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers of
        opiates and coca products to register with the Treasury
        Department and to keep records of transactions involving
        these substances&quot; (King, 1974, p. 19). This is how
        Congress intended to fulfill their obligation to the
        Hague Opium Convention. </li>
    <li>&quot;And it bears stressing again that in that day
        federal intervention into matters of local choice and
        personal concern was virtually unprecedented&quot; (King,
        1974, p. 21). </li>
    <li>&quot;...it was even possible for addicted persons of
        sufficient prominence and good connections to be
        'treated' with tacit Bureau protection. The payoff for
        this was what Commissioner Anslinger wanted in the way of
        appropriations for his forces, and new federal
        legislation he usually got virtually for the asking&quot;
        (King, 1974, p. 24). </li>
    <li>Re: Marijuana Tax Act of 1937--&quot;So the result was
        merely another nationwide enforcement empire and new
        categories of federal crime&quot; (King, 1974, p. 25). </li>
    <li>&quot;By 1937, when the Marijuana Tax Act was pushed
        through Congress, the T-men had begun to sound another
        note that would become their major theme for the ensuing
        decade: the charge that American drug problems were
        caused by too-light penalties for second and subsequent
        drug offenses&quot; (King, 1974, p. 25). </li>
    <li>At the same time the Senate Judiciary Committee held its
        hearing, the American Medical Association (AMA) and
        American Bar Association (ABA) made a study of the drug
        problem. The five recommendations which came out of this
        included </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;a comparative study of federal and state laws&quot; and
&quot;an evaluation of the effectiveness of current enforcement
policies&quot;. The Bureau of Narcotics threw a fit and attacked
with 'comments' on the recommendations and interference with the
project's funding (King, 1974, 28). </p>

<ul>
    <li>Daniel Glaser (1974, p.39) described two types of drug
        use. The first is &quot;instrumental&quot;, and that
        means a drug is used &quot;for a specific physiological
        effect.&quot; An example of instrumental drug use would
        be to take an aspirin for a headache, a cold preparation
        to relieve symptoms of sneezing and runny nose, or the
        addict taking opiates to relieve withdrawal symptoms.
        &quot;Appreciative&quot; use of drugs is &quot;done to
        conform to socio-cultural expectations in particular
        situations where shared norms and values encourage
        it&quot;; it is expected that a person have a drink
        containing alcohol at a cocktail party. </li>
    <li>&quot;Continued heavy use of opiates will almost always
        acquire an instrumental aspect when physiological
        dependence occurs and the users discover that opiates
        relieve withdrawal symptoms; this instrumental aspect is
        superimposed on any appreciative basis for its use&quot;
        (Glaser, 1974, p. 41). In other words, no matter how a
        person starts using opiates--appreciatively, socializing
        with friends, or instrumentally, coping with pain,
        ultimately use always becomes instrumental in relieving
        withdrawal symptoms. </li>
    <li>&quot;The newer pattern of opiate use predominant in the
        United States since World War II is initially more
        appreciative than instrumental. It occurs mainly among
        youth in urban areas who have a background of
        delinquency, of other drug taking, and of failure or
        dissatisfaction in conventional educational and
        occupational pursuits. Minority group youth from poor
        families are over-represented in this newer pattern of
        opiate use&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 41). </li>
    <li>Government agencies use prohibition and regulation to
        control drug use. &quot;Prohibition is directed at
        suppressing all use of a drug, while regulation is
        concerned only with restricting the circumstances,
        procedures, and subjects of drug use&quot; (Glaser, 1974,
        p. 41-42). </li>
    <li>&quot;The 1914 Harrison Act of the United States and the
        1920 Dangerous Drug Act of Great Britain are very
        similar, both being based on a 1912 International
        Conference at the Hague to promote opiate regulation
        ....[but] the American system gradually became one of
        prohibition,...while the British system remained more
        limited to regulation. Since the post-World War II
        legislation, opiate use has become a far costlier problem
        for American society than it was prior to World War
        II&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 42). </li>
    <li>&quot;Regulation rather than prohibition prevails in most
        of Europe and many other parts of the world. A salient
        advantage of regulation is that it permits files of
        police and health authorities to be much more complete
        and current on the number and characteristics of drug
        users than files where prohibition prevails and drug
        users are motivated to keep their drug use hidden from
        authorities. Further consequences of a prohibition rather
        than a regulation approach to drug control become evident
        when one examines how problems of policing depend upon
        the behavior to be policed&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 43). </li>
    <li>&quot;<i>Prohibition of drugs in great demand is feasible
        only in a tightly regulated society or in an isolated
        community; it has never closed more than a minute
        percentage of the actual or potential channels of supply
        for any profitable illegal drug market in America&quot;</i>
        (Glaser, 1974, p. 44). </li>
    <li>&quot;An acute shortage of opiates for addicts developed
        in the United States during World War II because
        shipments from opium-producing countries were cut off or
        impaired by enemy military actions....Since money was
        plentiful and addicts were desperate, the price they
        would pay for illegal opiates increased, and the
        tremendous profits in narcotics selling attracted
        professional criminals (Glaser, 1974, p. 46). </li>
    <li>&quot;The entrance of organized crime into large-scale
        narcotic trafficking after World War II more than met the
        demand of the older instrumental addict; these
        organizations also developed a new and greater market of
        appreciative users in the drug peddlers' home
        neighborhoods, the slums&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 46). </li>
    <li>Two direct relationships between drugs and crime are
        mentioned in Daniel Glaser's (1974, pp. 47-48). <u>Interlocking
        Dualities</u>: The first is &quot;the fact that
        prohibition laws make drug use or possession a crime in
        itself [and] that the chemical action of a drug on the
        human body causes a person to commit crimes. This is the
        'dope fiend' mythology widely promulgated by proponents
        of prohibition laws, notably those against alcohol,
        opiate, and marijuana. They allege that many assaults,
        robberies, and rapes result from users being 'crazed' by
        these drugs.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;...three indirect relationships of drug use to
        crime are all, in fact, effects of prohibition policies
        much more than of drug use itself: ...persons who are
        addicted but cannot afford the price of drugs will commit
        crimes to get money to pay for drugs [so] <i>the first of
        the distinctly prohibition-engendered types of crime is
        addiction-supporting professional property crime&quot; </i>(Glaser,
        1974, p. 49). The involvement of large-scale criminal
        organizations in the sale of illegal drugs is a second
        effect of prohibition....Because these criminal
        entrepreneurs operate outside the law in their drug
        transactions, they are not bound by business etiquette in
        their competition with each other, in their collection of
        debts, or in their non-drug investments. Terror,
        violence, extortion, bribery, or any other expedient
        strategy is relied upon by these criminals not only in
        the sale of illegal goods or services, but also in their
        investments in legitimate businesses of all types, from
        taverns to savings and loan associations. <i>The most
        serious impact of prohibition of drug use on crime
        probably is that which is most indirect--its consequences
        for the total administration of justice in a
        society&quot; </i>(Glaser, 1974, pp. 49-50) vis-a-vis
        erosion of the Bill of Rights, disrespect for the law in
        general, and shady enforcement policies. </li>
    <li>&quot;Social movements to enact <i>prohibition</i> laws
        have been promoted by 'moral entrepreneurs' when they
        regarded a drug as dangerous and promulgated an
        interpretation of its use as morally reprehensible
        (Becker, 1963). When that which is to be prohibited is
        used only by small or low-status segments of the
        population...passage of the legislation reflects a
        combination of the prohibitionists' exaggerated accounts
        of the harmful effects of these substances and the
        ignorance or indifference on this matter of the rest of
        the population. Under these circumstances legislators
        have a highly vocal group against them if they oppose
        prohibition, but there is little objection if they
        support it, so they vote for drug prohibition as though
        they were voting for Motherhood, even when they have no
        direct awareness [of it] as a problem&quot; (Glaser,
        1974, p.51). THIS GOES DIRECTLY TO THE POLICY OF
        DISCRIMINATION OF POOR AND MINORITIES, THOSE WHO THE LAWS
        DEFILE. A PERSON WITH CLOUT IS ABLE TO DETOUR THE
        CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OBTAIN HIS/HER <i>medicine </i>THROUGH
        PROPER CHANNELS. E.G. MCCARTHY. </li>
    <li>Glaser (1974, p. 50) predicted that &quot;the ultimate
        form of control for all non-medical drugs in the United
        States will greatly resemble the present controls for
        alcohol.&quot; UNFORTUNATELY, IN SPITE OF THE
        OVERWHELMING ARGUMENTS FOR DECRIMINALIZATION, WE CONTINUE
        TO PLUNGE HEADLONG INTO MORE REPRESSIVE LAWS, FURTHER
        BASTARDIZATION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE FURTHERANCE
        OF THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE &amp;QUOT;DRUG FIEND&amp;QUOT;. </li>
    <li>&quot;Probably in the future drugs will be available to
        those who crave them sufficiently, with no risk of
        criminal prosecution if they use authorized procurement
        procedures and only fines or other lesser penalties for
        illegal use....[and] the dispensation of more dangerous
        drugs will doubtless be under medical supervision&quot;
        (Glaser, 1974, p. 51). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Drug addiction is a major contributor to our
        nation's crime problem....Since possessing illegal drugs
        is itself a crime, and since addicts have to possess
        drugs in order to be addicts, addiction increases the
        total amount of crime&quot; (Gould, 1974, p. 57). </li>
    <li>&quot;Of the seven 'serious' crimes included in the FBI
        Index of Crimes (manslaughter, rape, assault, robbery,
        burglary, larceny, and auto theft) Americans are most
        fearful of the first four, crimes against the person
        (President's Crime Commission, 1967a: 87-89). But with
        the exception of robbery, these are not the crimes that
        drug addicts are most likely to commit&quot; (Gould,
        1974, pp. 58-59). </li>
    <li>&quot;To explain the epidemic qualities of drug use, one
        could turn to the works of Erikson (1966) and Durkheim
        (1958) who argue that crime becomes epidemic in form
        during periods of extreme social stress. Indeed,
        according to these sociologists, it is through the
        resolution of these epidemics that societies realign
        their normative boundaries and reaffirm the validity of
        their normative order&quot; (Gould, 1974, p. 72). </li>
    <li>The call for stiffer punishment is the
        'classical-utilitarian' theory which was &quot;the
        prevailing theory at the time our nation was
        founded&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 71) but has &quot;little
        currency among modern criminologists.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Positivist criminological theory is the hypothesis
        that people commit crime because of psychological,
        biological, or social factors in their present makeup or
        personal backgrounds....When crime has been on the
        increase, all positivist criminologists have been able to
        do is recommend treatment and rehabilitation&quot;
        (Gould, 1974, p. 71). </li>

    <li>&quot;Methadone maintenance-1 (MM-1) is the type of
        program currently being offered in a number of clinics
        imposing strict control. Urines are closely monitored and
        patients are confronted with evidence of illicit drug
        use. Take-home methadone is only permitted when there is
        continuing evidence of abstinence from heroin and other
        drugs, plus social stability. Patients are strongly urged
        to seek employment and are dismissed from the program for
        repeated drug use, alcoholism, irregular participation,
        and illegal behavior&quot; (McGlothlin &amp; Tabbush,
        1974, p. 87). </li>
    <li>&quot;A review of current methadone programs indicates
        that some 25 to 50 percent of the patients are indeed
        motivated by this aspect. They do want out of the
        addiction routine and are attracted by the normal rewards
        afforded by working, family, etc. They make minimum
        demands on the program staff, do not attempt to
        circumvent the treatment via substitution of other drugs,
        and often demonstrate a dramatic change in life
        style&quot; (McGlothlin &amp; Tabbush, 1974, pp. 89-90). </li>
    <li>&quot;It is useful to point out the logical fallacies
        resulting from society's ambivalence in dealing
        with...[addiction]. It is perhaps best reflected in the
        Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the crime of being
        an addict, but continue the felony penalty for possessing
        the necessary material for addiction (Robinson
        decision)&quot; (McGlothlin &amp; Tabbush, 1974, p. 117).

commitment in multimodality programming. In J. A. Inciardi &amp;
C. D. Chambers (Eds.), <u>Drugs and the criminal justice system</u>
(pp. 171-182). Beverly Hills: Sage Publications, Inc. </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;It is increasingly recognized today that criteria
        other than abstinence--such as improvement in
        interpersonal relationships, changes in self-image,
        employment, better use of leisure time, reduction in drug
        use and criminality, and general movement towards
        conventional behavior must be applied to assess treatment
        success&quot; (Meiselas &amp; Brill, 1974, p. 173). </li>
    <li>&quot;What must be stressed...is that there are all kinds
        of drug abusers, involved in varying degrees with drugs.
        Some may be 'deviant' only in the area of involvement
        with drugs and conventional in all other respects; while
        others are totally submerged in all aspects of living as
        subsumed under the term 'street addict'&quot; (Meiselas
        &amp; Brill, 1974, p.175). </li>
    <li>&quot;The question of civil rights and liberties has
        figured prominently in discussions about civil commitment
        as a device for compelling treatment. Psychiatrists and
        doctors such as Szasz (1963, 1970) and Well (1970) and
        sociologists like Schur (1965) hold that society has no
        right to define and control private behavior and see drug
        use as a personal affair. The natural corollary of this
        position is that treatment may not be indicated at all;
        or, if it is, it must be voluntary and not imposed since
        it then becomes punitive and valueless&quot; (Meiselas
        &amp; Brill, 1974, p. 179). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Imagine, if you will, that the drug abuse crisis in
        our country was the result of a conspiracy. A conspiracy
        so vast in its scope as to boggle the mind of a James
        Bond. The purpose of this conspiracy would be, of course,
        to so confound and confuse the United States of America
        that she consistently and mindlessly would pursue a
        course of absolute idiocy. That she would steadfastly
        perform acts that were antagonistic to her best
        interests--that would alienate her people, destroy her
        health, ruin her morale. Imagine the minds of her
        legislators befuddled, the souls of her judges and
        policemen hardened and twisted in hatred, the intellects
        of her educators confused, and her citizenry reduced to
        the level of a frenzied mob. Conjure up the picture of
        evil alien rules rubbing together their hands in glee
        over the sight of the most powerful nation in the world
        destroying itself from within, like a scorpion
        dispatching itself with its own stinger. </li>
</ul>

<p>And then ask yourself--if the truth is not too
painful--whether any evil aliens or sinister plots could have
succeeded in impairing our national welfare as totally as we have
done through our frenzied efforts to react to a phenomenon that
we never really attempted to understand. Try and recall the
period in our history when people first began to realize that
drugs were going to be a white middle-class problem in the United
States, and consequently decided to do something about it. Look
back on all the legislation, all the drug education programs, all
the legal and illegal police activities, and yes, even all the
National Football League public service announcements on drug
abuse. Are we any closer now to what we wanted to accomplish back
in 1964 in terms of keeping drug abuse within 'acceptable'
limits? If we could be magically transported back to those
fateful years of the 1960s and be given a chance to do the whole
thing over again, and then if we deliberately attempted to <i>create</i>
the drug problem, could we, even with the benefit of hindsight,
be more successful at throwing our country into crisis? </p>

<p>It is time to face the fact that after several frantic,
heartbreaking years of reaction and overreaction to drug usage,
we have accomplished virtually nothing--nothing except the
exposure of our legal system as an inept, sometimes oppressive
and corrupt instrument for the enforcement of public and private
morality. We have not curbed drug abuse...we haven't even slowed
it. What we have done is to further alienate an entire generation
of our children, already alienated by the reality they perceive
around them. </p>

<p>...Had the Vietnam war ended in 1965 or 1966, would the
'passive' 1950s have erupted into the massive disruptions and
violence of the 1960s? If the nation had reacted to the shame of
watching an overtly racist social system enforce its values by
utilizing firehoses, clubs, guns, bayonets, and vicious dogs to
subdue non-violent school children, and committed itself on a
long-term basis to establishing real equality for blacks, would
our children have turned away from their television sets in fear
and disgust and taken to the streets? An finally, if we had
reacted with acceptance, or even paternalistic amusement to long
hair, bare feet, unorthodox dress, and the conception of a new
type of brotherhood for our country, instead of with disgust,
envy, hatred, fear and violence--if we had taken the flower that
was offered instead of slapping the bearers' hands away--could we
not have kept our children, instead of driving them away?&quot;
(Greenberg, 1974, pp. 183-184). </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Americans are a peculiar people. More than any
        other country in modern times they have avowed their
        dedication to the highest principles of freedom. They
        have written and enforced a constitution emulated the
        world over for its protection of the major freedoms of
        the common man from the government which he has set above
        him. On the other hand, Americans have tolerated almost
        without qualms, restrictions on their rights of personal
        privacy...&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, p. 189). </li>
    <li>&quot;Virtually all laws which attempt to influence
        private morality suffer from the same
        defect--[they]...are generally passed to protect everyone
        else but the people who write them. Just as prohibition
        was initiated largely by non-drinkers, laws against the
        use of drugs were passed by those who hadn't the least
        idea of what drug usage was like&quot; (Greenberg, 1974,
        p. 189). </li>
    <li>&quot;<i>Many of the persons responsible for setting the
        moral and legal tone for our nation do not want to know
        the truth!</i> The truth is irrelevant to their reality.
        What <i>is </i>relevant to their reality is that, for
        political considerations, they do not want to be on
        record as being a political leader who presided over the
        legalization of drug usage--not in this era of the
        ascendancy of the silent majority. And if we have to
        throw a few thousand of our children into jail to
        preserve the purity of our politicians' voting
        records...so be it.&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, pp. 189-190).
    </li>
    <li>&quot;It is clear...that the majority of the drug abuse
        efforts in the middle and late 1960s was politically
        inspired. By this I mean that the rationale behind the
        legislation was not the control of drug abuse, but the
        deliberate harassment and suppression of an emerging
        minority group felt to be politically dangerous and
        morally disruptive. No other rationale can explain the
        severity of the sentences mandated for crimes which were
        basically passive in nature and consensual on the part of
        the 'victims'. Nothing else can explain the failure on
        the part of lawmakers to distinguish between users and
        pushers, between addicts and those who could control
        their usage. An finally, no theory other than political
        suppression can account for the concentration of emphasis
        on the small-time user and pusher and the massive
        disinterest in pursuing the major illegal suppliers of
        narcotics and other dangerous substances&quot;
        (Greenberg, 1974, p. 190). </li>
    <li>&quot;Tragically, legislators actually believe, in many
        instances, that stiffer penalties deter the commission of
        crimes [as noted in] the study made by the California
        State Assembly Committee on Criminal Procedure, 'Crime
        and Penalties in California', which found no evidence
        that severe penalties effectively deter crime&quot;
        (Greenberg, 1974, p. 191). </li>
    <li>&quot;Ironically, many observers have come to the
        conclusion that the vigorous enforcement of laws relating
        to drug abuse have actually led to an increase in
        drug-related crimes. This is because an increase in the
        harassment of pushers drives the price of drugs up.
        Consequently, the addict, who must steal from five to ten
        dollars of merchandise for every one dollar of drugs he
        needs, is forced to turn a greater number of tricks in
        order to acquire an ample supply&quot; (Greenberg, 1974,
        p. 191). </li>
    <li>&quot;The rules of the game in relation to the passing of
        legislation relating to the imposition of penalties for
        drug abuse...have been relatively simple...and
        simplistic: First, act quickly, before there is time to
        study the situation. Second, don't let scientific
        evidence corrupt your point of view...rely on your gut
        reaction and the inflamed passions of your constituency.
        Third, don't hesitate to sacrifice someone else's child
        for the cause (you can always use your influence to get
        your own child off). And finally, start from the
        bottom--you offend less important people by doing
        so&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, p. 191). </li>
    <li>&quot;There is a great disparity of opinion as to whether
        a narc should be classified as a law officer or as a
        criminal....Perhaps the most charitable thing I can say
        about narcotics agents is that they are a necessary part
        of a failing system. They are a reflection of the depths
        to which we will sink in our efforts to control men's
        lives and morals&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, pp. 194-195). </li>
    <li>&quot;Society and the policeman share an almost classic
        sado-masochistic relationship. Often, however, it is
        difficult to determine which party is the sadist, and
        which the masochist&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, p. 198). </li>
    <li>&quot;A significant minority of police officers
        consistently, deliberately, and ruthlessly violate the
        rights of the citizens with which they deal, and violate
        the Constitution and laws they are sworn to uphold.
        Police, acting in the line of duty, may be responsible
        for more violations of the law per capita than any other
        group. Probably in no other area is the police officer as
        abusive of his authority as in the area of drug arrests.
        Because of the nature of society's response to the drug
        abuse crisis, the controls that would ordinarily be
        placed upon the policeman has been removed or ignored by
        his superiors and by the general public&quot; (Greenberg,
        1974, p. 198). </li>

<ul>
    <li>The &quot;heroin epidemic was particularly bothersome to
        the Nixon administration for at least two reasons: (1)
        there was concern that an increasing level of heroin use
        at home was linked directly to Vietnam, and (2) an
        increasing number of heroin addicts, with their presumed
        reliance on crime to support their habits, was
        antithetical to the administration's stated goal of
        reducing crime in the streets&quot; (Clayton, 1981,
        p.20). </li>
    <li>&quot;In an election year it was wise from a political
        standpoint to be fighting heroin addicts and their
        criminality while implementing a rehabilitative treatment
        system to help those who might have become addicted in
        Vietnam&quot; (Clayton, 1981, p. 20). </li>
    <li>&quot;American drug control policy is based on the
        assumptions that a two-pronged simultaneous attack on
        drug abuse via supply-reduction and demand-reduction
        strategies will affect drug use, crime, and the
        drug-crime connection. The policy makers at NIDA
        [National Institute on Drug Abuse] were upset that the
        efficacy of this policy was not affirmed in the Report.
        Therefore, <i>they</i>, the policy makers, decided not to
        publish the PANEL Report as a NIDA document (Clayton,
        1981, p. 23). </li>
    <li>Weissman explained why &quot;...NIDA chose not to publish
        the PANEL Report...[because] it questioned the basic
        assumptions on which American drug-control policies are
        based. The policies to which he refers are those of
        supply reduction and demand reduction that are
        articulated in the Federal Strategy Report&quot;
        (Clayton, 1981, p.24). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Most of the early investigators found little
        criminality before the onset of opiate addiction (Kolb,
        1925; Terry and Pellens, 1928; Pescor, 1943). Later
        studies, however, have shown a high probability of
        criminality preceding heroin addiction (Robins and
        Murphy, 1967; Jacoby et al., 1973; Chamber, 1974). Thus,
        Jacoby reports that 71 percent of heroin users in
        Philadelphia had a delinquency record prior to onset of
        their opiate use, compared to 35 percent of all boys in
        the same citywide age cohort who also had such
        records&quot; (Ball, Rosen, Flueck, Nurco, 1981, p. 40).
        OF COURSE, THE VERY ACT OF POSSESSING IS ILLEGAL. IS THIS
        CONSIDERED WHEN FIGURING THE LABEL OF DELINQUENCY? WE
        CREATED THE BLACK MARKET IN DRUGS WHICH PUTS THOSE WHO
        WERE ADDICTED MEDICALLY INTO THE POSITION OF HAVING TO
        DEAL WITH 'CRIMINALS', AND THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED SOME
        DEVIANT ACT ARE MORE LIKELY TO MEET UP WITH THOSE
        INVOLVED IN DRUGS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE DRUG-CRIMINALITY
        CONNECTION. WE HAVE CREATED MOST OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS RE:
        DRUGS, AND THE ONES WE DID NOT CREATE, WE COMPLICATED. </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;For street opiate users, economic goal attainment
        focuses on meeting the demands of daily existence rather
        than on any long-term career development. Survival
        presents a daily challenge that is dealt with in whatever
        fashion appears most appropriate under variable and often
        difficult circumstances&quot; (Goldstein, 1981, p. 67) </li>
    <li>&quot;The economic successes achieved by street opiate
        users tend to be discrete and transitory. Subjects in
        this study perceived and recounted these successes using
        the processual term, <i>getting over....</i>The notion of
        'getting over' is similar to that of 'getting by'. Both
        phrases are most often used to describe an economic state
        of affairs. However, while 'getting by' implies a static
        state, a mere holding of one's own, 'getting over'
        implies a dynamic process in which some sort of success
        is achieved. For example, an addict who sells a less
        experienced user a $5 bag of heroin for $10 say, 'I got
        over on him'....Getting over usually involves a degree of
        scheming or conning&quot; (Goldstein, 1981, p. 68). </li>
    <li>Goldstein (1981, p. 71) states, &quot;Most subjects in
        methadone maintenance treatment programs sold some of
        their dosage at least once during the month they were
        under study. Ten individuals out of 13 MMTP clients who
        were observed sold treatment dosages...&quot; HOWEVER,
        THIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT MOST METHADONE
        MAINTENANCE PATIENTS SELL THEIR DOSAGES. ADDICTS IN
        GOLDSTEIN'S (1981) STUDY WERE REPORTING TO A STOREFRONT
        IN EAST HARLEM WHICH WAS &amp;QUOT;KNOWN TO BE A CENTER
        OF OPIATE ACTIVITY&amp;QUOT;, AND THOSE ATTRACTED TO THE
        STOREFRONT WHICH WAS USED AS A
        &amp;QUOT;HANGOUT&amp;QUOT; BY MANY SUBJECTS MAY HAVE
        BEEN THOSE NOT ACTIVELY SEEKING
        &amp;QUOT;TREATMENT&amp;QUOT; AND COUNSELING. THEY WERE
        MOSTLY MALE (92%). FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROGRAM I AM IN
        UTILIZES RANDOM URINES TO DETERMINE EXTRACURRICULAR DRUG
        USE, AND SANCTIONS ARE IMPOSED FOR THIS--LOSS OF
        TAKEHOMES IS A MAJOR &amp;QUOT;PUNISHMENT&amp;QUOT; OR
        SANCTION FOR &amp;QUOT;IMPROPER&amp;QUOT; DRUG USE. THOSE
        OF US WHO ARE WORKING AND/OR GOING TO SCHOOL DON'T HAVE
        TIME TO GO INTO THE CLINIC EVERY DAY TO DOSE, AND WE ARE
        NOT INVOLVED WITH THE &amp;QUOT;CRIMINAL&amp;QUOT;
        ELEMENT. </li>
    <li>&quot;Cop men may simply pocket all the money and never
        return with the drugs&quot; (Goldstein, 1981, p. 73).
        THIS IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS
        &amp;QUOT;BACKDOORING&amp;QUOT;, AND COMES FROM THE FACT
        THAT A CUSTOMER WILL GIVE A &amp;QUOT;COP&amp;QUOT; MAN
        MONEY TO BUY DRUGS, AND THE &amp;QUOT;COP&amp;QUOT; GOES
        IN ONE DOOR WHERE THE CUSTOMER HAS DROPPED HIM OFF. THE
        &amp;QUOT;COP&amp;QUOT; GOES OUT A DIFFERENT DOOR WHERE
        SOMEONE IS WAITING TO PICK HIM/HER UP AND LEAVES THE
        CUSTOMER SITTING MINUS MONEY AND DRUGS. THIS HAPPENS
        FREQUENTLY WHEN A CUSTOMER GOES TO HIS REGULAR
        &amp;QUOT;COPPER&amp;QUOT;, BUT THE COPPER'S CONNECTIONS
        ARE OUT OF DRUGS, AND THE ADDICT IS DESPERATE FOR A
        &amp;QUOT;FIX&amp;QUOT;. THE ADDICT WILL THEN USE ALL HIS
        POWERS OF RATIONALIZATION TO &amp;QUOT;TRUST&amp;QUOT;
        THIS NEW COPPER BECAUSE S/HE IS SO DESPERATE FOR THAT

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Beginning with the Harrison Act in 1914, however, a
        series of events occurred that linked addiction with
        crime. As the addict population became typified by
        lower-class black males, moral hostility increased and
        'the image of the addict changed from a sick to a
        contemptible deviant' (Conrad and Schneider, 1980:128).
        Addiction had become a social problem&quot; (Datesman,

    <li>The film <i>Reefer Madness</i> shows a marijuana smoker
        &quot;turning into a werewolf-like creature after
        inhaling marijuana smoke&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 106). </li>
    <li>&quot;Whenever a drug user engages in violence, the media
        are apt to describe the incident in such a manner as to
        imply the continued existence and danger of drug
        fiends&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 106). </li>
    <li>In the early 1900s, &quot;the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
        was very active in describing the drug addict as behaving
        in a bizarre, unpredictable, often violent manner. The
        pre-World War II popular media influenced by the Bureau
        of Narcotics portrayed drug users quite literally as
        monsters and fiends&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 105). </li>
    <li>&quot;It is suggested that any attempt to understand the
        relationship between drugs and crime must include a focus
        on the daily life and interaction of the
        user--particularly within the context of the drug
        deal--not just on the activities undertaken to obtain the
        money for drugs&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 120). </li>

    <li>&quot;The Canadian Commission...reports that 'of all
        drugs used medically or non-medically, alcohol has the
        strongest and most consistent relationship to
        crime'&quot; (Goldman, 1981, p. 167). ALTHOUGH WE TRIED
        PROHIBITION, MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO USE ALCOHOL, IT IS NO
        LONGER ILLEGAL TO USE OR POSSESS IT. WE DO, HOWEVER,
        DELEGATE RESPONSIBLITY TO THE USER FOR ANY CRIMES S/HE
        MAY COMMIT UNDER ITS INFLUENCE. NOT SO WITH CERTAIN
        DRUGS; WE DON'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE USER WILL DO, BUT
        THE VERY ACT OF POSSESSION OR USE IS A CRIME IN ITSELF.
        THAT'S LIKE SAYING, &amp;QUOT;YOU ARE A CRIMINAL JUST BY
        VIRTUE OF OWNING OR SHOOTING A GUN. YOU MAY NOT HAVE HURT

    <li>Thomas Sowell (1989, October 2) stated &quot;...there is
        nothing so bad that politics cannot make it worse. Drug
        gang violence is not due to the chemical nature of drugs
        but to the illegality of drugs, which is what makes them
        costly and profitable. Ending Prohibition did not stop
        alcoholics from destroying their lives, but it did
        put...bootleggers out of business.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Hard core cocaine addicts are increasing but they
        are still less than one-half of one percent of the
        American population. Are the other 99 percent of the
        people to see their country and its institutions and

        group from destroying itself?&quot; (Sowell, 1989,

        center for drug dealing after all, but that a drug dealer
        elsewhere was lured there for this transaction just so
        the president could go public with the cocaine purchased

<ul>
    <li>In Principles of Legislation (1802), by Jeremy Bentham
        (1990, p. 85), he deals with the law and his
        interpretation of political good and evil on the
        following basis: </li>
</ul>

<p>It is with government, as with medicine. They have both but a
choice of evils. Every law is an evil, for every law is an
infraction of liberty: And I repeat that government has but a
choice of evils: In making this choice, what ought to be the
object of the legislator? He ought to assure himself of two
things; 1st, that in every case, the incidents which he tries to
prevent are really evils; and 2ndly, that if evils, they are
greater than those which he employs to prevent them. There are
then two things to be regarded; the evil of the offense and the
evil of the law; the evil of the malady and the evil of the
remedy. </p>

<p>Eg: The operation was a success but the patient died. </p>

<ul>
    <li>General Rule: Leave to individuals the greatest possible
        latitude in every case where they can only injure
        themselves, for they are the best judges of their own
        interests. If they deceive themselves, the moment they
        perceive their error, it is to be presumed they will not
        persist. Do not suffer the power of the law to interfere,<b><i><u>
        unless to prevent their injuring each other</u></i></b>
        (emphasis mine). It is there that law is necessary; it is
        there that the application of punishment is truly useful,
        since the rigor shown toward one may ensure the safety of
        all...&quot; (Bentham, 1990, p.86). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;If our society ever becomes interested in actually
        managing 'the drug problem' instead of throwing an
        ideological temper tantrum, it will concentrate its
        efforts on the long-term process of designating
        community-based regulatory mechanisms, in the public and
        private sectors, to influence and moderate drug-taking
        behavior. It will fund research into these
        alternatives&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 213). </li>
    <li>&quot;The Reagan Administration sliced the prevention and
        treatment budget in half in order to funnel the money
        into law enforcement&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.214). This
        is exactly the opposite of what should have been done. </li>
    <li>As Wisotsky states (1990, p. 214), The War on Drugs is so
        wrong, so ineffective, and so destructive that almost any
        alternative should be preferred by thinking people. It
        would be hard to do worse than the status quo.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Experience in Oregon, California, and Maine
        following decriminalization of marijuana in the 1970's
        showed no significant percentage of new users or an
        increase in frequency of use&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.
        215). </li>
    <li>&quot;The premises of the War on Drugs, in addition to
        being objectionable in principle, fail to offer any
        practical solution to the problem of drug abuse, which
        grows worse every year. The War on Drugs has no creative
        or constructive power whatever&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.
        216). </li>
    <li>Wisotsky (1990, p. 216), concludes that &quot;the War on
        Drugs is beginning to collapse of its own weight.&quot;
        This would be wonderful if true; and if so, it better
        hurry. </li>
    <li>&quot;As the hegemonic, senior generation over age 45 or
        50 dies off, it will be replaced by one for whom the War
        on Drugs makes no cultural sense, quite apart from its
        operational failures and black market pathologies&quot;
        (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 218). AND WITH ALL THE SOCIAL
        PROBLEMS WE HAVE WAITING TO BE SOLVED, IT'S TOO BAD MONEY
        FROM TAXABLE, REGULATED DRUGS IS NOT BEING MADE
        AVAILABLE. IN FACT, ALL THE MONEY BEING PUMPED INTO LAW
        ENFORCEMENT IS TAKING AWAY FROM AND CAUSING MORE SOCIAL
        PROBLEMS. </li>
    <li>&quot;Many studies report that the more (accurate)
        information a person has about drugs, the less likely he
        is to regard them as dangerous&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.
        219). </li>
    <li>&quot;The adoption of cocaine by the middle classes was
        evidently considered hot copy by the media, which
        reported on it incessantly and often sensationally&quot;
        (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 11). </li>
    <li>&quot;Viewing the entire cocaine industry as one
        corporation, it would rank seventh in sales among the
        Fortune 500&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 17). </li>
    <li>&quot;Another way of describing the rationalistic bias of
        this [objective] research method is to see it as
        anti-holistic, i.e., a captive of the Cartesian division
        between mind and body, analyzing the sum of the parts to
        learn about the whole without considering the interaction
        of the parts and possible synergistic effects. The bias
        against 'experiential' models of drug effects reflects a
        conceptual reductionism of human beings to mere
        components or parts (body or mind) reacting like machines
        to drug stimuli in standardized fashion&quot; (Wisotsky,
        1990, pp.19-20). </li>
    <li>&quot;The law thus neatly serves as prescription both for
        ignorance and for maintenance of the status quo&quot;
        (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 20). </li>

    <li>&quot;Perhaps because of our diversity as a people, it is
        difficult for us to find a stable basis for
        'congregating' as a nation, a circumstance that amplifies
        our collective craving for moral crusades against
        scapegoats bearing heavy loads of imaginary dangers&quot;
        (Szasz, 1990, Foreword xvi). </li>
    <li>&quot;The sacrificial principle of victimage (the
        'scapegoat') ...explains why it is such a sad truism
        that....'it is indeed probable that more harm and misery
        have been caused by men determined to use coercion to
        stamp out a moral evil than by men intent on doing evil.'
        In my opinion, this is not just probable, it is quite
        certain&quot; (Szasz, 1990, Foreword xvi). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Quite frankly, it would have been impossible for a
        nonuser to have gained access to this group to gather the
        data presented here&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 24). </li>
    <li>Many factors are involved in the pricing of illegal
        drugs: cost of the drug from the source; prevailing
        market price; location (logically, border towns provide a
        less expensive product since drugs are more plentiful
        there); risk of arrest associated with the number of
        borders crossed; how long the drugs have to be held
        before sale; distance of travel before sale; mode of
        transportation &quot;(especially if they have to transfer
        the drugs from one mode of transportation and/or storage
        to another)&quot;; credit considerations; quality
        (however, the quality of cocaine was &quot;fairly
        consistent [so] they thus let the dealers to whom they
        sold worry about testing and cutting the product&quot;;
        and situational conditions including &quot;need of
        money&quot; or personal relationships (Adler, 1993, pp.
        45-48). </li>
    <li>&quot;There were two basic forms of drug dealing:
        straight dealing and middling. Straight dealing involved
        purchasing drugs in one quantity and dividing them into
        smaller units to sell....[One type of midling involved
        selling the] drugs they purchased intact, without
        separating them into smaller units....The second type of
        midling was customer initiated. Dealers were often
        approached by people looking to buy a specific amount of
        drugs....[The dealer then] matched a source of supply
        with a cash purchaser,...boosted the price[,] and made
        money on the transfer&quot; Adler, 1993, pp. 49-53). </li>
    <li>&quot;In contrast to straight dealing, dealers who
        middled rarely adulterated the drug....'cause God forbid
        you have to give it back....A small quantity, however,
        was often removed for the middler's own personal
        consumption&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 53). </li>
    <li>&quot;It's not really dealing--[midling] it's just
        putting together two connections, but the trick is to
        keep them apart so they don't know who each other are and
        they need you to complete the link&quot; (Adler, 1993, p.
        54). </li>
    <li>&quot;Money meant nothing to me. Like, if some guy gave
        me a $100 bill I'd go out and burn it or cut it in half
        for all I cared&quot; (Adler, 1993, p.86). MONEY MEANT
        NOTHING TO ME EITHER EXCEPT THAT I HAD TO HAVE IT TO GET
        MY DRUGS. I ONLY THOUGHT OF MONEY IN TERMS OF HOW MANY
        DILAUDIDS I COULD PURCHASE--OTHER THAN THAT, I DIDN'T
        CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. </li>
    <li>Describing the lows of freebasing, a user states,
        &quot;Lows? It's like when you can't get up to go to the
        bathroom and your mind goes by itself. When you're up
        pacing the floor--your mind, but your body's not. When
        you're so wired and exhausted and you just want to sleep
        but you can't . You lie there staring at the ceiling for
        about 14 hours straight. You're so fucked up you're
        embarrassed to go out of the house. Falling asleep in
        public bars&quot; (Adler, 1993, pp. 88-89). UNLIKE OPIATE
        ADDICTION, THERE IS DEBATE AS TO WHETHER COCAINE IS
        PHYSICALLY ADDICTING. THE LOWS FROM OPIATE ADDICTION
        INCLUDE DEFINITE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES WHICH INCLUDE... </li>
    <li>Some &quot;children of the dealing crowd
        eventually...graduated to become 'tinydealers.' Moving
        into junior high and high school, 13- and 14-year-old
        dealers were capable of making large sums of money by
        selling ounces of marijuana and grams or half-grams of
        cocaine to their peers&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 93). </li>
    <li>&quot;To make it in the drug world, dealers and smugglers
        had to generate trust and likability. The most important
        character trait in this regard was <i>integrity</i>.
        According to others, quality dealers were honest and fair
        in their business transactions, gave exact
        &quot;counts&quot; (full weight values), and made fairly
        accurate estimations of the quality of their
        product.&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 100). </li>

    <li>&quot;In the 1930s, if a person accused of a crime could
        not afford to hire an attorney, he went to trial with no
        defense except his own efforts. It was not until 1942
        that the Supreme Court forced the states to appoint an
        attorney for an accused person, and then it was only for
        capital offenses. Twenty-one years later, in the famous
        case of <i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i>, the Supreme Court
        required the state to appoint an attorney to defend any
        indigent person accused of a felony&quot; (D'Amato, 1992,
        p. 49). </li>
    <li>&quot;By spring of 1968, &quot;resistance to the Vietnam
        War was so intense, so broad, and so angry that it had
        driven President Lyndon Johnson to announce that he would
        not run for reelection&quot; (D'Amato, 1992, p. 91). </li>
    <li>On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assasinated
        (D'Amato, 1992, p. 92). </li>
    <li>&quot;In Chicago [Martin Luther King, Jr.] recruited
        young men who were members of street gangs and converted
        their anger into energy for change. One of his early
        strategies was to appoint them marshals of the marches.
        It was their job to keep the peace. When glass bottles
        and bricks and rocks rained down from the rooftops at the
        marchers, the gang-members-turned-marshals caught them as
        a ballplayer would catch a pop fly, and then laid them
        gently on the ground&quot; (D'Amato, p. 73). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;We are starting to see how the gradual loss of the
        Self occurs in addiction, and how the addictive
        personality slowly gains more and more control. <i>The
        decrease in the Self causes an increase in the addictive
        personality.</i> </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there is an almost constant internal conflict
between the Self and the Addict. In this struggle, the Addict
wins. This is what is meant by &quot;loss of control.&quot; The
longer the struggle, the more control the addictive personality
gains and establishes. Each time the Self struggles against the
addiction, the Addict becomes stronger. To fight and struggle
against something that has more power than you drains your
energy. For each defeat there is some loss of self-esteem... </p>

<p>...In addiction, the Addict becomes the dominant personality. </p>

<p>People and family members often desperately ask themselves and
others, 'Why does he act like this? Doesn't he care about us
anymore?' The truth is that the Addict within doesn't care about
them. What it cares about is acting out, getting the mood change.
The Addict doesn't care about the Self either. A statement such
as, 'At least if you won't stop for me, stop for yourself!' falls
on deaf ears. The person who suffers from an addiction often asks
the same question long before anyone else: 'Why do I act this
way? Don't I care?' </p>

<p>It's often a great relief for people suffering from an
addiction to realize that they are not 'bad people', as they
believed, that their addictive personality is not all of them,
but only a part of them, having grown as a result of the
illness&quot; (Nakken, 1991, pp. 36-37).<br>

    <li>&quot;Cocaine came to be addictive among some inner-city
        users and among a very small percentage of middle-class
        users who tried the drug. </li>
</ul>

<p>Why didn't most of these people become cocaine addicts? The
answer is so simple that we are left wondering why scientists
can't figure it out: Most people have better things to do than to
become addicted to cocaine&quot; (Peele, 1991, p. 42). </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;A study of middle-class users of cocaine by the
        Addiction Research Foundation of Toronto found not only
        that most regular users do not become addicted, but also
        that most of those who develop a steady craving for
        cocaine eventually cut back or quit the drug on their
        own&quot; (Peele, 1991, p. 42). </li>
    <li>&quot;...we have reached a strange impasse in our
        civilization when we rely for information and moral
        guidance about habits on the most debilitated segments of
        our population--groups who attribute to addiction and
        drugs what are actually their personal problems. What,
        really, are we to learn from people who stand up and
        testify that they couldn't control their shopping spress,
        that they spent all their money and went bankrupt to get
        material possessions we were smart enough to resist, and
        that they now want us to forgive them and their
        debts?&quot; Who should we listen to regarding
        addiction--the moralists or the addict? (Peele, 1991, pp.

        most of those who drink are not doing it for the purpose
        of getting drunk, but those who take drugs are
        essentially moral degenerates because they take drugs to
        get high. He states, &quot;I know of no one who would

    <li>&quot;The first two laws prohibiting opium smoking were

        of the Chinese&quot; (Monson, 1980, p. 48) who were
        thought of as an inferior race. In 1910, legislation was
        requested regarding cocaine since it was

        direct incentive to the crime of rape by the Negroes of

    <li>&quot;Officials in drug-producing and -processing
        countries are quick to point out that the tremendous
        demand for drugs in the United States drives the drug
        business&quot; (Hyde, 1990, pp. 90-91). </li>
    <li>&quot;Many of the dealers are shot, some by the police
        when they resist orders, some by drug dealers who are
        trying to protect their turf or intimidate

        bed. More than a hundred people were killed in her

        related. ....Valerie wishes the police would arrest the
        dealers on the corner, but if they do, other dealers will
        take their places&quot; (Hyde, 1990, p. 26). </li>
    <li>&quot;Some experts in the field of drug abuse note that
        the first laws aimed at controlling opiate use in the
        United States were aimed at controlling a racial minority
        that the public feared....Many news reporters blamed the
        'yellow devils,' the relatively small group of Chinese
        laborers, for the spreading addiction problem in America
        and especially for corrupting American youth.
        Emotionalism was rampant, and moral reform movements were
        common. Alcohol, opium, and other drugs were the targets
        of crusades that fought against the use of drugs that
        affect the mind&quot; (Hyde, 1990, p. 33). </li>
    <li>&quot;At first, heroin was considered benign and was used
        as a substitute for liquor. It was backed by the Bayer
        Company for a short time, before it was recognized as
        producing the same kind of addiction as morphine&quot;
        (Hyde, 1990, p. 33). </li>
    <li>&quot;Until more is learned, many doctors are willing to
        accept methadone as the best treatment in the war against

    <li>&quot;In rapidly growing numbers, unskilled, poorly
        educated people in inner-city areas are finding drug
        dealing the most lucrative career option available to
        them. Many children enticed into the drug culture at an
        early age drop out of school and by their mid-teens enter
        the violent world of drug dealing and distribution&quot;
        (Berger, 1989, p. 34). </li>
    <li>&quot;Being a lookout is the entry-level position for
        nine- and ten-year-olds in the drug trade. It is the job
        of a lookout to warn dealers when police are in the area.
        For this, they can make ;up to $100 a day and be rewarded
        with a pair of fashionable sneakers, a bomber jacket, or
        a bicycle&quot; (Berger, 1989, p. 35). </li>
    <li>&quot;Being a runner is the next step up the ladder for
        ambitious young teenagers who want to succeed in the drug
        trade. The job can pay up to $300 a day. The runner
        transports the drugs to the dealers on the street. In the
        case of crack, the youngster takes the drug from the
        makeshift factories, where cocaine powder is cooked into
        rock-hard crack, to the dealers&quot; (Berger, 1989, p.
        36). </li>
    <li>&quot;Youngsters in the drug culture are often completely
        on their own. Family members may be living apart or may
        be dead....Seventy-two percent of the boys and girls in a
        correctional institute study said they had grown up
        without one or both parents&quot; (Berger, 1989, p. 37). </li>
    <li>&quot;As a source of income, dealing is especially
        attractive to low-income, disadvantaged youth. With few
        other possibilities for employment and troubling family
        situations, many embark on a career of drug dealing&quot;
        (Berger, 1989, p. 45). </li>
