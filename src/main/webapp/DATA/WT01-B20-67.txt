items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">February 2, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>European Parliament
Commission Favors Legalization of Cannabis</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recognizing the success of the Dutch policy of separating
marijuana from hard drugs, The European Parliamentary Commission
on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs voted Monday for &quot;cannabis
decriminalization.&quot;&nbsp; The full European Parliament is
expected to vote on this recommendation later in February.&nbsp;
Usually the parliament follows the recommendation of the relevant
commissions, but the United States is expected to bring maximum
pressure to prevent the replication of the Dutch success in
separating cannabis from hard drugs. </p>

<p>(For more information contact the European Parliamentary
Commission on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs in Brussels.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Drug Czar and Partnership For
A Drug-Free (sic) America<br>
Hold a Closed -- by Invitation Only -- &quot;Briefing&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Washington -- At the last minute, it was decided that a
&quot;briefing&quot; held this afternoon at the Old Executive
Office Building adjacent to the White House by Drug Czar Lee
Brown and James Burke, Chairman of the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America and the former CEO of pharmaceutical giant
Johnson and Johnson, was &quot;by invitation only.&quot;&nbsp;
This may have been done because of embarrassing questions having
been asked at their New York press conference on January
16.&nbsp; Consequently, the media were excluded from the
Washington version.&nbsp; This is unusual in Washington, where
media attendance at such &quot;briefings&quot; is generally
encouraged. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the New York meeting the Partnership announced a series of new
radio and television and print ads which American media are now
running as a part of their support for the continuing arrest of
millions of Americans for using marijuana.&nbsp; That briefing,
like the ads, warned about the horrifying dangers of the
marijuana crisis now sweeping America and causing terror in our
streets, the main drug concern of both the White House and the
Partnership.&nbsp; The purpose of the briefings -- and the
apparent reason for their being by invitation only -- seems to be
the growing panic among prohibitionists about being asked
critical questions.&nbsp; The media have so seldom been critical of
any claims about marijuana made by the Partnership or the Drug
Czar's office that the prohibitionists have not yet developed a
strategy for answering them.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, it may
have been decided not to risk having anyone present who might
disrupt the meeting by asking questions. </p>

<p>(Please do not call either the Drug Czar's office at
202-395-6618 or especially the Partnership at 212-922-1560 and
ask them any questions.&nbsp; That sort of thing just upsets
them.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Maine Governor Ends
Helicopter Marijuana Searches</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On February 1 the Associated Press reported that Maine
Governor Angus King is discontinuing helicopter flights searching
for marijuana growing in rural areas of Maine.&nbsp; Governor King
said the flights were &quot;too expensive for the return.&nbsp; I
think it's intrusive.&quot;&nbsp; The Maine Civil Liberties
Union, which has represented four Maine families who objected to
the invasion of their privacy by flights -- in which no marijuana
was found -- hailed the Governor's action. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The AP story reporting the Governor's action quoted an anonymous
undercover agent as saying that an anonymous &quot;marijuana
trafficker&quot; had told him that anonymous &quot;local growers
had increased their yield substantially in 1994 in response to a
cessation in flights.&quot;&nbsp; Presumably the AP was unable to
find any anonymous supporters of privacy rights to quote
anonymous victims of the overflights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML has published a special report on the role of the National
Guard in domestic marijuana eradication including the extensive
use of helicopters in both urban and rural areas. </p>

<p>(For copies of this NORML Report contact Allen St. Pierre at
NORML -- 202-483-5500.&nbsp; For more information on Governor
King's decision to cancel helicopter overflights for marijuana cultivation
contact Maine Civil Liberties Union Legal Counsel, Christopher
Branson at 207-773-5651.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Chief Coroner of Canadian
Province of British Columbia Calls for Consideration of
Legalizing Cannabis.</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>The Vancouver Sun Times</i> reported in a January 21 story
that Vince Cain, the chief coroner of British Columbia, said that
&quot;the so-called war on drugs which is conducted by the
criminal justice system can only be regarded as an expensive
failure.&quot;&nbsp; Cain went on to say that &quot;Police officers
have told me they're wasting their time on this social
issue.&quot;&nbsp; These comments came in a report entitled <i>Illicit
Narcotic Overdose Deaths in B.C.</i> published by the British
Columbia provincial government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, Cain used the
report to urge that the provincial Attorney General consider
legalizing the sale of marijuana.&nbsp; The report was discussed further
Tuesday at a meeting of provincial and federal law enforcement
officials.&nbsp; A senior Royal Canadian Mounted Police rejected
the report saying, &quot;we want a drug free society.&quot;&nbsp;
He then went on to say that the vast majority of Canadians have
used alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p>(Chief coroner Cain can be reached at 604-660-7737.&nbsp; The
B. C. Attorney General can be reached at 604-387-5008.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Kentucky Governor Creates
&quot;Hemp Fiber Crop Task Force&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones, reversing his previous
position on hemp cultivation, has created a special task force to
study the restoration of what once was one of Kentucky's most important
legal crops.&nbsp; (Illegal marijuana is currently the most
valuable cash crop in Kentucky.)&nbsp; In the late 19th century,
Kentucky produced more than 90% of the nation's hemp, which is
also the marijuana plant.&nbsp; This action has long been urged
by former NORML Board member and Kentucky Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is possible to grow varieties of hemp that have virtually no
psychoactive ingredients.&nbsp; It is generally recognized as one
of the most versatile agricultural plants, and it is cultivated
for non-drug purposes in China and most of Europe.&nbsp; There is
a strong demand for hemp fiber for clothing in America, but The
Drug Enforcement Administration opposes its cultivation in the
United States because it would send the wrong message: that
American farmers have been kept from growing an agricultural
staple as part of the propaganda campaign for marijuana
prohibition. </p>

<p>(For more information on the Hemp Fiber Taskforce call Jim
Claycomb at 502-564-2611) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>At Last, an O. J. Simpson
Marijuana Story (almost)</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On January 20, <i>New York Newsday</i>, in a cover story,
reported that new NORML Board Member and 1993 Nobel Laureate, Dr.
Kary Mullis, the inventor of DNA testing, has said that he would
testify that he &quot;wouldn't rely on the tiny blood samples
collected as solid proof of anyone's guilt.&quot;&nbsp; Now, if
O. J. would just read <i>Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine</i>
(Yale University Press) co-authored by NORML Board Chairman,
Lester Grinspoon, M. D. of Harvard, perhaps the book would be
reviewed and someone might report on the arrest of sick and dying
Americans as a part of the suppression of medical access to
cannabis. </p>
