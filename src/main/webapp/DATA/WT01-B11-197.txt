<B>Regulatory Restructuring for Aggregates and Petroleum Industries
</B>

</CENTER><P>


Ontario is changing the way it regulates the aggregates and petroleum industries to make industry more accountable for meeting strict provincial standards, Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today.<P>

As part of the government's ongoing efforts to eliminate barriers to job creation, the ministry has been working with the Red Tape Review Commission to reduce the impact of its regulations and practices on business growth.<P>

"Changes to the ministry's aggregates and petroleum programs will eliminate red tape and inefficiency, streamline delivery and remove barriers to private sector job creation," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

"This restructuring will maintain Ontario's leadership in regulating the two industries, and improve MNR's enforcement capability to ensure regulatory compliance," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

MNR will work with the aggregates industry to develop a compliance partnership where the industry will be responsible for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring, while the ministry will concentrate on auditing and enforcement.<P>

"I am also pleased to announce changes to modernize petroleum regulations and bring them more in line with other jurisdictions," Mr. Hodgson said.
A new type of well licence, for example, will make regulatory and administrative processes more efficient, while making it clear that landowners and well operators are responsible for registering their wells and meeting strict provincial standards.  Changes to the Act will also support enforcement efforts, by increasing the maximum fine for offences under the Petroleum Resources Act to $500,000 from $10,000.<P>

Increased efficiency will also result from the move to simpler, more concise regulations, combined with clearly defined, detailed technical standards.  These standards will allow MNR to be more responsive to emerging issues, while providing the industries with greater clarity about how they should manage their operations. <P> 

These standards will be developed in consultation with industry representatives, and other key stakeholders, and will be similar to current Canadian Standards Association standards governing hydrocarbon storage.
