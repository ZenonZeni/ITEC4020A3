<H4>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TAXATION</H4>
<P>CITIES AND GREED is an easily comprehensible examination of the assessment and taxation of the building and land components of real estate in Canadian municipalities. Ottawa lawyer Francis K. Peddle exposes the damaging economic and social effects of the indiscriminate taxation of both buildings and land as the primary source of revenue for local government. Dr. Peddle shows how the many negative influences currently embedded in the local property tax can be alleviated by simultaneously lowering the tax or mill rate on the building component of the real estate tax and proportionately increasing the rate on the land value component.</P>

<H4>URBAN ECONOMICS</H4>
<P>This book examines the interlocking problems which pervade our urban economies and systems of municipal property taxation. The principal proposal of the book, which would see the current system of property taxation replaced by a site value system of taxation, or what is now often called, especially in the United States, a two tier property tax, has been long advocated by tax reform groups, urban economists and others who are dismayed at how real estate speculation and the monopolization of community-created wealth negatively affects our economies.</P>
<HR>
<H4>CONTENTS</H4>
<P>CITIES AND GREED analyzes in depth how the current property tax discourages improvements to properties, encourages land speculation and increases land costs, contributes to urban blight and thwarts urban renewal, results in environmentally destructive urban sprawl, raises municipal costs and abets the housing shortage and inadequate housing. The issues of fairness and equity in taxation are addressed as well as the distorting effect of the current property tax on property rights and urban planning. The book connects cycles in real estate speculation with unemployment, inflation and declining productivity.</P>
<P>CITIES AND GREED evaluates the basic principles which should govern any system of taxation as they have developed in the history of economics. The positive effect of land value taxation is surveyed as it has been variously implemented around the world. There is also a chapter on the history and practice of land value taxation in Canada during the twentieth century.</P>
<HR>
<H4>TAX REVOLT</H4>
<P>There is now a pervasive and profound tax revolt going on in Canada that is aimed at the tax policies of all levels of government. What form this revolt will take in the coming years is anybody's guess, but there is no doubt it will intensify. This publication shows readers that there are viable and constructive alternatives to the current tax.</P>
<HR>
<H4>CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION</H4>
<P>Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of society and brought to a halt social progress. Not infrequently the end result of arbitrary and punitive forms of taxation is social turmoil and revolution.</P>

<P>By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and extending a helping hand to the needy. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line.</P>

<P>The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.</P>

<P>The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean urban environments.</P>
