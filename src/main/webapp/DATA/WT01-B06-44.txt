Building Toward an Investment Plan Starting From Scratch </H2><P>
<HR>

How do you go about starting an effective investment program if you are young or entering the investment world with a very small amount of money available to invest?<p>


First, of course, you should go through the asset allocation process, determining your allocation among the major asset categories, and then further down among the major stock market segments. This will serve as your ultimate goal.<p>


However, you won't be able to implement it immediately. Why? Mutual funds are the preferred route for newcomers, because they can provide broad diversification, as well as professional expertise at a low cost. However, most mutual funds have minimum initial investments. That means that if you have, say, $2,000 to invest, you will start out by investing in only one fund.<p>


What kind of funds can serve as starter funds? Here are two approaches:<p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Balanced Start:</strong> Under this approach, you would start your investment program by investing in a balanced or asset allocation fund that divides its assets in a relatively set range between stocks, bonds, and cash. Additional investments can be made to the fund until you have saved enough to begin investing in funds in more specific market segments.<p>


This has the major advantage of immediate diversification in the major asset categories with one minimum initial investment. The disadvantage, however, is that you cannot control the allocation--and many younger investors seek heavier commitments to stocks than is typical of balanced funds.<p>


Another disadvantage is that as you build up your savings, you will most likely outgrow the balanced fund--in other words, you will want to switch from the balanced fund to several different funds according to your asset allocation plan. If your balanced fund is taxable savings, you will have to pay taxes on any gains when you switch.<p>


If you use this approach, make sure that you fully understand your chosen fund's investment approach, because the names can be confusing. Some funds that call themselves "asset allocation funds" try to time the various market segments by changing their asset mix depending on their outlook. These types of funds should be avoided.<p>


<li><strong>Concentrating On Core Stocks: </strong>Under this approach, you would save up to the minimum initial investment of a broad-based stock index fund, and then invest the entire amount in it. The disadvantage, of course, is that you are fully exposed to the stock market during this time. But since you are just starting out, you most likely have a very long-term time frame (possibly over 30 years) and can afford to take on substantial stock market risk.<p>


The index fund serves as the core of your overall portfolio as you start to build toward your investment plan. It will be the most conservative portion of your stock market commitment, composed primarily of large-capitalization stocks; when you add on, you will be adding on more aggressive commitments--small stocks and international, for instance.<p>


Using an index fund gives you exposure to the stock market, but takes out "manager risk." For investment newcomers, this makes the mutual fund selection less daunting. However, you do need to focus on an appropriate index. Since the fund will be your core stock holdings, you should select one that targets a large-cap stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 or a broader index that still encompasses large-cap stocks, such as the Wilshire 5000. <p>
</ul>

Once you have picked a starter fund using either the balanced fund or core approach, keep adding to it over time, and gradually build up your commitment with the ultimate goal of matching the investment strategy you set up originally. Concentrate first on meeting your allocation goals among the three major market segments--cash, bonds, and core stocks.<p>


If you started with a balanced fund, you may want to next add a stock fund (once you can meet the minimum) to increase your percentage investment in stocks, and perhaps an intermediate-term bond fund after that; you can then start the switch out of the balanced fund.<p>


If you started with a core index fund, you could next add the minimum to an intermediate-term bond fund (in fact, you will have created your own "balanced" fund).<p>


At what point do you start diversifying beyond the major market segments--in particular, when should you consider diversifying your stock portfolio beyond the core? This will depend on the minimum initial investments of the funds that you have chosen and the percentages that you plan to commit to the other market segments. However, to have a meaningful effect, you really need a minimum commitment of around 10% to any market segment.<p>


Lastly, don't agonize over small deviations from your overall allocation plan. For instance, if a minimum investment in a small stock fund results in a 12% or 13% commitment to small stocks, and your strategy only calls for a 10% commitment to small stocks, go ahead and invest. Your overall allocation goal is only a rough guide.<p>
