<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Congress</a>:
Immigration</a><a></a>,
Welfare, Minimum
Wages</a></a</a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration.</u>  In July, Republicans continued to debate among
themselves whether to try to include the Gallegly amendment in pending
legislation aimed at reducing illegal immigration.  It would give states the
right to prevent illegal alien children from enrolling in K-12 schools; Bob
Dole supports the Gallegly amendment, while President Clinton opposes
it.</tt><p>
<tt>After the two Republican Senators from Texas expressed opposition to the
Gallegly amendment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich asserted that "Until we
effectively control illegal immigration, every state should have the right to
decide whether its limited budget should be spent to provide benefits to
illegal aliens."  </tt><p>
<tt>Colin Powell also opposed the Gallegly amendment, calling it a
"shortsighted" way of dealing with illegal immigration.  One of the California
author's of Prop 187, Ron Prince, came out against the Gallegly amendment,
arguing that its inclusion was really a ploy to prevent any immigration
legislation from passing.</tt><p>
<tt>As of mid-July, the House had not yet named its conferees to the committee
that will reconcile the House and Senate versions of immigration reform
legislation.  Once named, the conference committee has 20 legislative days to
reconcile the two bills.  It is possible that the House conferees will not be
named until Congress returns from its summer recess in September.</tt><p>
<tt>The House voted 338-87 in favor of the immigration bill on March 21, 1996,
and the Senate approved a similar bill by a vote of 97-3 on May 2, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is an issue on which Dole and Clinton differ sharply.  Dole
supported Proposition 187 in California, while Clinton opposed it.  In
California in June, 1996, Dole said "When I am president, there are going to be
two wars declared: a war on illegal  immigration and a war on drugs."</tt><p>
<tt>The Republican National Committee reportedly spent $1.5 million on ads in
19 states that asserted that there are five million illegal immigrants in the
US, and then attacked President Clinton for "giving benefits to illegals."  The
Democratic National Committee countered with ads that asserted that "President
Clinton increased border patrols 40 percent to catch illegal
immigrants."</tt><p>
<tt>In a New York Times Op-ed on July 11, California Governor Pete Wilson
argued against the 1982 Supreme Court decision, Plyler v Doe, that requires the
states to give public school education to all resident children regardless of
their immigration status.  He said Plyler v Doe was an "unfunded federal
mandate" and should be removed.  Economist George Borjas countered on the same
page that the best way to deter illegal immigration would be to enforce
employer sanctions, even if that meant the introduction of a national employee
verification system.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 700,000 illegal alien children in K-12 US schools,
including 355,000 in California--California spends $1.8 billion annually for
the schooling of illegal alien children.</tt><p>
<tt>Some teacher groups pledged not to enforce the law if it is approved,
though school administrators, not teachers, enroll pupils in most US
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>A Gannett News Service poll of 1,027 adults throughout the US on June
20-25, 1996 reported that 63 percent of those polled thought all children
should be able to attend school.  At the same time, the poll found that 71
percent of the respondents believed immigrants got too many public benefits
such as welfare, medical care, and food stamps, even though 83 percent said new
immigrants are very hard-working.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 58 percent of respondents believed new immigrants take jobs from
American workers, and 59 percent thought they drive down wages.  Most of those
polled agreed that new immigrants start businesses that help the economy, and
almost half agreed the newcomers bring needed skills to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A Los Angeles Times poll of Orange County Republicans found that 45 percent
favored building a wall along the United States and Mexican border--35 percent
of all US residents in this survey favored building such a wall.  Minorities
are 35 percent of Orange county's 2.4 million residents, but they are only 19
percent of the county's registered voters.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Orange County Republican Party paid part of a settlement of $400,000 to
resolve a lawsuit over a 1988 incident in which the party hired uniformed
security guards to police voting places in heavily Latino precincts in Santa
Ana.</tt><p>
<tt>Other issues took a distant second place to the Gallegly amendment.  Some
advocates took aim at the provision in the House bill that would require US
residents sponsoring the immigration of their relatives to have incomes that
were at least double the poverty line income for the residents and their
relatives--the Senate has a 125 percent of the poverty line requirement, up
from the current 100 percent rule.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were also calls to relax provisions in the new anti-terrorism law
approved March 1996 that would adversely affect asylees.  In signing the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in April, 1996, the anniversary
of the Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton said that "this bill also makes
a number of major ill-advised changes in our immigration laws having nothing to
do with fighting terrorism," and Clinton urged Congress to make revisions.
</tt><p>
<tt>The anti-terrorism law is being used to detain without bail aliens living
in the US who were convicted of crimes committed in the US.  Many immigrants
are caught when they return to the US from trips abroad as when, for example,
an INS inspector comes upon data in the computer that show that a permanent
resident returning to the US from abroad was convicted of drug possession 20
years earlier.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since the anti-terrorism law eliminates waivers of deportation for criminal
aliens, even permanent residents married to US citizens and who have US-born
children can be detained and deported.   The law does not distinguish between
crimes committed long ago and those committed recently.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has asked for more flexibility in dealing with such cases; under
the current law, it cannot stop deportation proceedings.  Since 1993, the INS
has deported 140,000 foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>In presidential politics, former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm announced
on July 9 that he would seek to be the presidential nominee of Ross Perot's
Reform party.  Lamm has been an outspoken advocate of stricter limits on
immigration to the US; he has proposed reducing the number of legal immigrants
by half, and doing more to stop illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The American Friends Service Committee in San Diego is urging Mexican
shoppers to boycott San Diego-area stores the weekend before the August 12-16
Republican National Convention in the city to dramatize the Mexican community's
displeasure with immigration reforms pending in Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>The House Appropriations Committee July 11 approved a $3.1 billion for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and increase of $531 million over
FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 25,000 Americans of mixed race demonstrated in Washington on July 20
in favor of a "multiracial" category on the 2000 Census.  Most minority groups
oppose permitting e.g. the child of a Latino and a White to describe themselves
as "multiracial," in part for fear that the undercount of minorities in the
census would increase.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare Reform.</u> On July 18, the House approved by a 256-170 vote a
welfare reform bill that would give states lump sum federal payments that they
could use to assist poor people as they thought best.  The head of every family
receiving cash assistance would have to work within two years or the family
would lose assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>States would have to require welfare recipients to work to obtain full
federal payments, and able-bodied adults would have to work at least 20 hours
each week if they want to receive Food Stamps for more than three
months.</tt><p>
<tt>The House bill puts a five-year "lifetime" limit on any family receiving
cash assistance, and permits states to have shorter limits.</tt><p>
<tt>The House bill is expected to save $10 billion per year-- one-third of the
savings come from denying food stamps and other benefits to current and future
legal immigrants--about one million immigrants would lose Food Stamps.  </tt><p>
<tt>Another 500,000 legal immigrants who have not become US citizens and are
currently receiving payments would be cut from the Supplemental Security Income
program; half of those eliminated from the SSI program have been in the US for
10 or more years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants would be barred from Medicaid until they became US citizens, and
almost all social service programs would have to verify the immigration status
of applicants for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate on July 19 refused to permit legal immigrants receiving SSI
payments to stay on the rolls under its bill.  By a vote of 62-34, the Senate
rejected a proposal by Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) to allow legal immigrants now
receiving welfare, food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits to continue
receiving them under the same conditions as US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>House Speaker Newt Gingrich emphasized that "Welfare reform must include a
general ban on welfare benefits for noncitizens."  President Clinton favors
restricting the access of immigrants to welfare by requiring US residents who
sponsor immigrants to live up to their sponsorship agreements, not having a
blanket bar to their participation written into law.</tt><p>
<tt>If approved, the ban on welfare for legal immigrants will affect California
and other immigrant states most.  For example, about 52 percent of the legal
immigrants receiving SSI payments are in California.  California counties are
currently required by state law to provide cash aid and health care to the
indigent, so if poor immigrants were removed from federal welfare programs,
California state and local governments may have to pick up the tab.</tt><p>
<tt>About 12.8 million people in 1995 received $22 billion in cash benefits
through Aid to Families With Dependent Children --two-thirds are children.  The
other two major programs targeted for reform are Food Stamps, which spent $29
billion to provide food coupons to 26 million people, and Supplemental Security
Income, which served 6.5 million people at a cost of $26 billion in 1995.
Since a disproportionately large number of the children of recent immigrants
come from poor families, the cuts will affect them more severely than the
children of the established American population.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the Republican plan, there would be a five-year limit on welfare for
any family, and states could set shorter eligibility periods.  On July 16,
President Clinton pledged to require welfare recipients to work after two years
of aid, with or without new welfare legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton vetoed Republican proposals to reform welfare programs as
part of the budget reconciliation process on December 6, 1995, and as a stand
alone reform on January 9, 1996.  Republicans agreed to consider welfare and
Medicaid changes separately, as President Clinton demanded, making it likely
that the welfare bill will be signed into law.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Minimum Wages</u>.  On July 9, the US Senate approved by a vote of 74 to
24 an increase in the minimum wage of $0.90 to $5.15 per hour by July 1, 1997.
The minimum wage would rise to $4.75 30 days after the bill is signed, and
employers would be able to pay teenagers the $4.25 hourly wage for the first 90
days of their employment.  Republicans attempted and failed to keep the minimum
wage at $4.25 for the employees of companies that have less than $500,000 per
year in sales.</tt><p>
<tt>The House approved a similar bill by a vote of 281 to 144 in May 1996, and
the House and Senate must work out differences between their bills before
President Clinton signs the wage increase into law.  </tt><p>
<tt>At $4.25 per hour, a full-time 2000 hour per year worker earns $8500; at
$5.15, annual earnings are $10,300.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, about 3.7 million US workers 16 or older were paid $4.25 or less
per hour; they represented about 5.3 percent of all hourly paid workers.  Teens
aged 16 to 19 are about one-third of those paid $4.25 or less; about 73 percent
of all minimum wage workers are white.</tt><p>
<tt>When the minimum wage was last raised, from $3.35 to $3.80 in April 1990,
and to $4.25 in April 1991, the percentage of teenagers who were employed fell
from 47 percent in March 1990 to 40 percent in June 1992--about 43 percent of
US teens were employed in mid-1996.  However, it is not clear how much
decreased teen employment is due to the higher minimum wage, and how much was
due to the July 1990-March 1991 recession.</tt><p>
<tt>The hike in the minimum wage is expected to offset at least partially the
wage depression in US labor markets due to the influx of unskilled immigrants.
Harvard economist Jeffrey Williams concluded that, between 1870 and 1910,
immigration reduced the real wages of unskilled US workers by 10 percent.  The
movement of so many workers from southern and eastern Europe to the US also
reduced global inequality.  Williams believes that immigration since 1980 plays
a "significant role" in rising inequality in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas agrees that immigration reduces real wages and increases
inequality.  According to Borjas, 20 to 30 percent of the drop in the real
wages of unskilled workers is due to immigration.  David Jaeger of the Bureau
of Labor Statistics concludes that immigration is responsible for as much as
half of the real wage decline of high school dropouts in the US labor
force.</tt><p>
<tt>A Wall Street Journal analysis of DOL investigations of US firms found that
many construction and apparel firms unlawfully refuse to pay their employees
overtime wages.  One employer group estimates that US workers are unlawfully
denied $19 billion per year in overtime pay.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL's 800 inspectors open 20,000 investigations each year, mostly following
complaints, and wins settlements for workers in about 90 percent of the cases.
The largest overtime law violator in recent history was the Food Lion grocery
store chain, which agreed in 1993 to pay $11 million to 21,600 workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Federal law requires that workers employed more than eight hours daily or
40 hours weekly be paid 1.5 times their normal wage--DOL estimates that
two-thirds of US workers are covered by these overtime rules.  But salaried
employees--defined as persons who do not receive hourly pay--who work
"independently" are exempt from overtime rules, which leads to confusion--some
courts have held that newspaper reporters are exempt, while others have ruled
that, because the reporters follow editor's instructions, they are covered by
overtime laws.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 16, DOL held a Fashion Industry Forum on sweatshops in the US in
which mostly immigrant women sew garments.  Earlier, the House by voice vote
transferred $5 million from the Job Training Partnership Act to DOL's Wage and
Hour Division's garment industry sweatshop enforcement efforts.</tt><p>
<tt>The General Accounting Office, in a 1984 report, defined a sweatshop as "an
employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing
minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial homework, occupational
safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration."</tt><p>
<tt>DOL Secretary Reich asserted that two factors are promoting sweatshops in
the US--the increased concentration in the retail apparel and accessory
stores--the 20 largest firms in 1992 accounted for more than 41 percent of
retail sales in all apparel and accessory stores--and the fact that the higher
fashion end of the industry that depends on changes in styles is increasingly
returning to the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 853,000 workers employed in the US apparel manufacturing
industry in May 1996, down almost 50 percent from the peak 1.45 million in
1973.  About 70 percent of US apparel workers are women, and their average
earnings of $7.94 are well under the average hourly manufacturing wage of
$12.71.</tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the 22,000 registered sewing shops in the US are believed
to be pay their workers below the minimum wage or violate federal overtime
regulations.  A DOL survey of apparel manufacturers in Southern California in
1996 found that 43 percent of sampled firms had failed to pay some of their
workers the minimum wage, 55 percent of firms had overtime liabilities, and one
third were not registered--as required--with the state of California.</tt><p>
<tt>Most garments are sewn in what is known as the "progressive bundle system,"
in which each worker specializes in a few of the 20 to 40 operations involved
in making a garment.  The bundle system involves large inventories, so that
there is work available for workers, and it is slow to respond to fashion
changes.  The alternative is a modular or team based system in which groups of
workers assemble a garment, with each worker performing multiple tasks.</tt><p>
<tt>WalMart, the US retailer originally charged with using children in Honduras
to sew "Kathie Lee Gifford" clothes, promised to use an independent inspector
to ensure that its US sewing shops abide by US labor laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The sweatshop controversy was set off in May, when a 15-year old Honduran
woman testified that she worked 74 hours weekly for $0.31 per hour to sew
"Kathie Lee Collection" clothes for Wal Mart.  WalMart stopped buying garments
from the Korean-owned company in Honduras, throwing many of the 600 women
employed there out of work. The Honduran Maquiladora Association says its
member firms have stopped hiring workers under 16. Kathie Lee reportedly
received $7 million from WalMart.</tt><p>
<tt>Interviews with women employed in maquiladoras in San Pedro Sula, Honduras,
one of whom made the original allegations against talk show host Kathie Lee
Gifford in May 1996, suggest that the women who work in the maquiladoras are
much better off than those who do not work in them, even at wages of $0.35 per
hour, helping to explain why so many women and girls are lined up waiting for
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Honduras is a country of six million with a per capita income of about $600
per year.  Unemployment and under employment are 30 to 50 percent.  About 20
percent of the 75,000 garment workers employed in 160 garment shops in Honduras
are unionized.</tt><p>
<tt>Apparel-making is a $500 million per year business in Honduras.  Honduran
law permits 14 year olds to work up to six hours per day and 36 hours per
week.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 15, Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) introduced a bill that would
block the importation of goods made with child labor.  The legislation, if
approved, would require the US government to identify countries that do not
prohibit child labor, or that have child labor laws but do not enforce them,
and the industries in which child labor is used.  To enforce this proposed law,
manufacturers could earn an international label that asserts that children were
not used in the manufacture of a product.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO estimates that some 73 million children between the ages of 10 to
14 are employed worldwide.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">INS:
 Enforcement, Asylum,</a> and
Naturalization</a></></a></h2>
<tt><u>Enforcement</u>.  Beginning in 1993, the INS implemented a "prevention
through deterrence" strategy along the US-Mexican border, seeking to discourage
illegal immigrants from entering the US rather than apprehending them after
they crossed the border.  This strategy called for fences, lights, and more
agents visible on the border.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along the US-Mexican
border south of San Diego, doubling the number of agents along 14 miles of
border, and arraying them in three tiers to make it harder for aliens to elude
apprehension.  After 20 months, the INS is apprehending about the same total
number of illegal aliens in the San Diego sector.  However, in the westernmost
Imperial Beach sector of the border, where Gatekeeper was concentrated,
apprehensions in the first nine months of the fiscal year fell sharply, from
138,000 in 1994 to 84,000 in 1995 to 60,000 in 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the eastern sector of San Diego county, apprehensions rose from 1,785 in
the first nine months of FY94 to 21,000 in 1995 to 60,000 in 1996.  The INS
argued that this eastward shift in apprehensions proved that Gatekeeper is
working--according to the INS, aliens are easier to apprehend in the east.  By
one estimate, an alien could slip into a US house or car within 20 minutes of
crossing the border in the westernmost section of the border, while at least 12
hours is required further east.</tt><p>
<tt>However, several Border Patrol agents in San Diego complained that their
supervisors encouraged them to under-report apprehensions along the westernmost
part of the US-Mexican border, and to over-report apprehensions further east,
in an effort to show that Operation Gatekeeper was pushing illegal aliens
attempting entry further east.  Aliens were reportedly bussed east to be
processed, and then returned across the border where they would attempt
re-entry, increasing reported apprehensions. </tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, Border Patrol supervisors allegedly returned aliens to
Mexico without processing them and removed or shut off buried sensors along
popular  illegal immigration routes on the westernmost stretch of the
border.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 1, 1996, the INS began an investigation into the charges that the
apprehension data were manipulated.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of a US-Mexican agreement, Mexicans from the interior of Mexico
who are apprehended in the US can volunteer to be flown home at US expense.
Reporters who accompanied a group of Mexicans flown from San Diego to
Guadalajara and given bus tickets to their home villages, report that the
Mexicans had tried at least three or four times to enter the US illegally
before consenting to go all the way home.  </tt><p>
<tt>One farm worker from Autlan, an area where half of the men usually migrate
to the US, expressed surprise at how difficult Operation Gatekeeper has made
illegal entry to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS extended its Employment Verification Pilot to San Diego in July
1996.  Under the EVP system, after an acknowledged immigrant is hired, the
employer submits his A-number to INS computers, which return an "authorized" or
"not authorized" message.  Workers who are "not authorized" are asked to
contact the INS to verify their status.  </tt><p>
<tt>During a seven-month trial of the EVP system in 1995 by 234 employers in
Los Angeles and Santa Ana, nearly 3,000 false immigration documents were
detected among 11,400 new hires.  The EVP system screens only those who
acknowledge that they are foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Atlanta in Summer 1996 became a mecca for unauthorized immigrants as well
as Olympic athletes and fans.  Unauthorized immigrants are particularly drawn
to construction and service jobs in the area.  INS inspectors have received
many tips from US construction workers in the area identifying places that
unauthorized workers are employed.  The INS has a total of 54 inspectors in
Alabama, Georgia, and North and South Carolina.</tt><p>
<tt>One unauthorized Mexican worker, detained at a Veteran's Administration
hospital asbestos removal job, expected to work 70 hours each week and send
$500 weekly to his family in Mexico.  The unauthorized workers who were
detained reported that their employers "knew" that they had presented false
documents to get their jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There was considerable speculation about whether and how many Cuban
athletes might defect during the Olympics, especially after two of Cuba's top
boxers defected from their team in Mexico in June 1996.  A US-born
Cuban-American agent predicted that many members of Cuba's national baseball
team would defect.  There are 10,000 athletes from 197 nations in Atlanta for
the Olympics.</tt><p>
<tt>Asian and Latino immigrants have begun to change the northern suburbs of
Atlanta, with Asian restaurants in Chamblee, and a requirement in Smyrna, with
5,000 Latino residents, that all public signs must be in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS continued to be criticized for "deceiving" a seven-member
Congressional delegation visiting Miami June 10, 1995.  According to the
Inspector General's report, INS officials moved detained aliens out of
overcrowded facilities, and authorized overtime at Miami airport, to cause the
visiting Congressional delegation to believe that there was little overcrowding
or delays.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS union complained after the visit that the Congressmen had obtained
a distorted picture, and INS  officials initially tried to cover up the
deception.  The Inspector General was able to re-create erased email messages
that detailed the deception and cover-up.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has 33 district offices around the country.  The quality of the
services they provide to often anxious immigrants varies considerably.
Foreigners in the US wanting to change their temporary permission to permanent
residence or otherwise revise their status must be interviewed at one of these
offices.  INS district offices also administer examinations for naturalization
and arrange naturalization ceremonies.</tt><p>
<tt>The 33 district directors have different priorities and philosophies, so
that some use their resources to reduce waiting times for those seeking green
cards, while others concentrate on other issues.  In the Washington DC area,
the differences between the DC and Baltimore offices are such that some lawyers
advise their clients to move to Maryland so that they can deal with the
Baltimore office.</tt><p>
<tt>The districts also differ in their philosophy toward asylum seekers--some
are reluctant to release asylum seekers who entered the US illegally or with
false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-June, ten illegal alien construction workers were detained by the
INS while working for a contractor at Anacostia Naval Station.  The contractor,
a Portuguese immigrant who won the contract under a government set aside
program, said that he had carefully checked what turned out to be fraudulent
documents submitted by the workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In suburban Chicago, the INS on June 25 raided the Palatine Park District
and detained 21 landscape workers in one of the rare inspections of local
government employees.  Since October 1, 1995, the INS in the Chicago area has
conducted 55 employer inspections, and detained 600 illegal Mexican
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Near Eagle Pass, Texas, Mexican drug smugglers are reportedly using illegal
aliens to attempt to carry 100 pounds of drugs each in backpacks into the US.
Nationally, the US seizes an estimated five percent of the total drug flow from
Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>In southern Texas, midwives, known as partera, deliver many of the babies
born to poorer women in their homes, and then prepare birth certificates that
show the babies were born in the US.  In thousands of cases, midwives also sell
false birth certificates to the parents of children born in Mexico that assert
that a child was born in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of an INS investigation, several midwives have been arrested,
and Texas is considering tightening its regulations on the issuance of birth
certificates.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  In 1994, the INS estimated that in October
1992 there were 3.4 million aliens present in the US without documentation, and
that the number of illegal aliens settling in the US was increasing by about
300,000 per year.  Revised estimates suggest that the illegal alien population
was larger in October 1992--3.8 million, including 1.8 million in California,
up from an earlier estimate of 1.4 million--but that the rate of increase in
the illegal alien population was lower--250,000 per year throughout the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>The revised estimates suggest that the illegal alien population in the US
increases by about 1 million every four years and will reach 4.8 million in
October 1996.  Because of potential errors associated with such estimates,
another range is provided.  Thus, the unauthorized alien population of October
1996 is expected to be 4.1 to 4.9 million, within it the range for unauthorized
Mexicans is 2.2 to 2.7 million.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the revisions increase the estimated number of Mexicans who were
illegally present in the US in the late 1980s, including some who may have
entered in the hope that there would be another amnesty.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  In FY95, some 149,500 foreigners applied for asylum in the
US, up slightly from 146,400 applications in FY94.  In the first six months of
FY96, there were 90,700 asylum applications. These data include 147,400
applications filed under a court settlement for Central Americans, but not the
20,000 to 50,0000 applications filed each year by aliens seeking to avoid
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>In July 1996, seven members of the family of the man convicted of
assassinating Mexican Presidential candidate Luis Colosio in Tijuana on March
23, 1994 was granted asylum in the US for fear that they would be persecuted by
the Mexican government in Mexico.  The seven illegally entered the US in 1994,
after the killing, and they are now eligible to apply for permanent resident
status in the US after a one-year wait.</tt><p>
<tt>An article in the Washington Post on July 7 compared two asylum cases:  a
Chinese man who used a false Japanese passport to enter the US, and sought
asylum because of China's one child policy, and that of a Togo woman who used a
false British passport to enter the US, and sought asylum because she feared
genital mutilation in her native Togo.  The writer noted that the Chinese man
was released and given a work permit (the INS now requires a 180-day wait
before issuing work permits to asylum seekers), while the Togo woman was placed
in detention.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS does not have data on the numbers of asylum applicants who are
detained and released, making it hard to detect patterns in detention and
release decisions.  The INS is attempting to develop guidelines to help its
officers decide which applicants for asylum should be detained.  Reportedly, 94
percent of the asylum seekers who were released at Kennedy and Miami airports
did not show up for their asylum hearings.</tt><p>
<tt>The US asylum system is criticized from many quarters.  Restrictionists
complain that undeserving migrants apply for asylum, and too many then receive
asylum.  They note that the prospect of forced abortion or sterilization in
China can be grounds for asylum, as well as the threat of forced female genital
mutilation in Africa.  </tt><p>
<tt>Such policies are easily abused.  An estimated 90 percent of the Chinese
applicants for asylum come from three counties in Fujian Province, where aliens
are coached in how to satisfy the US requirements for asylum.  A Chinese asylum
seeker, who was released after applying for asylum, admitted that he came to
the US for economic reasons rather than because of the one-child policy.  After
his release, he joined a gang that extorted money from other Chinese
immigrants, and was sentenced to 11 years in US prison.</tt><p>
<tt>Others critics of US asylum policy and practice, use the disparate INS
treatment of asylum seekers to argue that release or detention depends on the
individual judgments of mid-level INS officials rather than rational
standards.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has space to hold 8,400 aliens in 13 centers around the US--four
are operated by private firms for the INS.  Most of those detained are
foreigners who arrive in the US and seek asylum with no papers or with false
documents.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS plans to reopen the Elizabeth, New Jersey detention facility that
was closed after 315 detained asylum seekers rioted to complain of harassment
and poor conditions on June 18, 1995.  The INS will now have a different
private firm operating the facility.  Some state and local jails are adding
capacity so that they can offer beds to the INS.  The York, Pennsylvania county
jail plans to add 500 beds to house foreigners for the $50 per day that the INS
pays private contractors.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Naturalization.</u> The INS continues to struggle with a record number
of applications for naturalization--there were 1,056,981 naturalization
applications in 1995, up from 592,000 in FY94.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS is expected to naturalize one million aliens in 1996, including
327,000 in southern California.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has authorized six private firms to test immigrants wishing to
become US citizens in English, and it disqualified one of those firms, Spanish
Business Services based in Florida, after learning that the firm helps
immigrants to cheat on the test.  About 20 percent of the persons who become
naturalized US citizens take tests at private firms.</tt><p>
<tt>Latino activists are launching a nationwide effort, called Latino Vote USA,
to register one million new voters by November's general election.  About 85
percent of Latinos live in nine states that have 202 of the 270 electoral votes
needed to elect a President--Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 27 million Hispanics in the US in 1995, including 17
million who are 18 or older.  In the 1992 election, an estimated 4.2 million of
the 5.1 million registered Hispanics voted, and 61 percent of the Hispanic vote
went to Clinton, 25 percent to Bush, and 14 percent to Perot.  In the 1994
election, only 3.3 million of 5.2 million registered Hispanic voters cast
ballots.</tt><p>
<tt>The Texas-based Southwest Voter Registration Education hopes to increase
the number of Latino voters by 20 percent or one million by November
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Naturalization is open to foreigners who have had the status of legal
resident in the US for at least five years, were physically present at least
2.5 of these years, are at least 18, and are of "good moral character."
Applying for naturalization costs $95.  The applicant must take a test to
demonstrate that he/she can read and write English, and must answer correctly
12 of 20 questions on US history and government (Questions include:  What is
the Bill of Rights? Which countries were US allies in World War II? What are
the colors in the US flag?  What is Congress?  What does July 4 celebrate?

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Mexico</a>/US
</a>Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>It is often asserted that Mexico and the US have the largest wage gap
between contiguous countries, but the World Bank's World Development Report,
released in June 1996, shows Poland had a lower GNP per capita than Mexico in
1994, $2410 versus $4180, while Germany and the US each have per capita GNPs of
about $25,700.  This makes the Polish-German ratio 1 to 11, and the Mexico-US
ratio 1 to 6. (The Polish economy expanded by seven percent in 1995, while the
Mexican economy shrank by about seven percent).</tt><p>
<tt>The Czech and Slovak Republics were also poorer than Mexico, with per
capita GNPs of $3,200 and $2,250 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany, however, permits Poles to enter Germany without visas, and has
several programs through which Poles can work legally in Germany.  The US
requires visas or shopping cards from Mexican visitors, and offers relatively
few temporary work visas.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany attempts to prevent illegal Polish immigration and employment with
a mandatory resident registration system, and extensive labor market controls
that bear equally on citizens and non-citizens.  The US, by contrast, puts most
of its enforcement efforts at the border rather than inside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>As Mexico moves closer to approving dual citizenship, US think tanks have
begun to study the effects of dual nationality on Mexican and other Latin
American immigrants.  According to the Tomas Rivera Center, there is no clear
relationship between dual citizenship and naturalization.  About 40 percent of
the immigrants in the US from Latin American countries that offer dual
citizenship have become naturalized US citizens, versus 36 percent of the
immigrants from Latin American countries that do not offer dual
citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Absentee voting rights are also not correlated with US naturalization
rates--about 36 percent of the Latin American immigrants from countries that
offer absentee voting are naturalized, versus 37 percent from countries without
absentee voting.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 28, 1996, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said that Mexico
needed to distribute income more equally to address the growing gap between
rich and poor, and between the industrialized north and the rural south.
</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's income distribution became more unequal in the 1990s, and Mexico
has, according to the World Bank, the sixth most unequal income distribution in
the world outside Africa--the richest 10 percent of Mexican residents received
41 percent of national income in 1994, up from 34 percent in 1984.  Latin
American countries with more unequal income distributions include Brazil and
Panama, where the richest 10 percent of residents receive about half of the
national income.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Forbes, Mexico includes 15 of Latin America's 39 billionaires,
even though Mexican's are only 20 percent of the region's population.  Forbes
reports that there were 447 billionaires in 1995, including 149 in the US, 110
in Europe, and 41 in Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>The poorest 50 percent of Mexican residents receive only 16 percent of
national income, and the number of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has grown
to 22 million, an increase of 5 million since the peso devaluation in December
1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Growing inequality is evident in market activity.  Sales of
Mexican-produced Volkswagen Beetles fell sharply in 1995, while Mercedes-Benz
sales are expected to rise 50 percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mexico's San Quintin Valley, 130 miles south of Ensenada, some 500 to
800 of the 25,000 mostly migrant farm workers broke into businesses and
restaurants in Poblado Lazaro Cardenas for food when they were told that they
would not be paid for the third straight week.  Farmer Arturo Lomeli
Villalobos, one of about 50 large farmers in the area, said he was unable to
convert dollars into pesos fast enough to pay the workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the farm workers in the San Quintin Valley are Indians from
southern Mexico--Mixtecs, Zapotecs, Oaxacans and Triquis.  Most speak little or
no Spanish, and many work 12 to 15 hours a day for daily wages of 25 pesos or
$3.33.  The workers have been protesting low wages and poor housing for
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican economy is stabilizing--prices are expected to rise between 27
percent and 29 percent in 1996.  However, real wages in Mexico in 1996 are
below what they were in 1981, and the Mexicans doing best are those with ties
to the US economy, either via trade or migration.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1996, a procession of US fruit and vegetable growers have charged that
"unfair competition" from Mexico and Central America is hurting them.  First
came Florida tomato growers, then the California avocado industry and, in May
1996, California sugar pea growers complained that Guatemala, which produces an
estimated 70 percent of the world's snow peas and snap peas, have an unfair
advantage in lower labor costs and a climate that allows year-round sugar pea
production.</tt><p>
<tt>In both Florida and Mexico, tomatoes are picked by migrant Mexican workers.
Mixtec Indians from Oaxaca are prominent parts of the tomato work force in
Sinaloa and California, and Huichole Indians do much of the harvest work in
Mexico's Nayarit state.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 2, 1996, the International Trade Commission rejected 4-1 the
Florida growers petition under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act.  The 201
petition sought relief from price-based import surges of tomatoes and peppers
from Mexico; if the ITC had agreed with Florida growers, President Clinton
could have imposed extra duties on Mexican tomatoes.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the International Trade Commission on May 16 voted to continue a
separate antidumping investigation on fresh tomatoes from Mexico, as requested
by Florida tomato growers.  The ITC found a "reasonable indication" that the US
industry is being materially injured by tomatoes from Mexico that were sold
below cost in the US. </tt><p>
<tt>A preliminary Commerce Department determination on dumping is expected in
early September, and a final decision on the antidumping petition is expected
in January 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico produces about 45 percent of the world's avocados, some 800,000 tons
per year, but Mexican avocados have been banned from the US since 1914.  Some
100,000 workers are employed on 8000 avocado farms in Michocan, one the major
states of origin for Mexican migrants headed to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The ban on Mexican avocados is expected to be lifted in November 1996, but
California avocado growers are resisting a lifting of the ban, arguing that
more study is needed to ensure that imported Mexican avocados do not bring
pests with them. USDA regulations on avocado imports require that there be an
"absence of infestations of injurious insects known to attack fruits and
vegetables" in the area of origin of the fruit during the 12 months before
importation.</tt><p>
<tt>Under proposed USDA regulations, Mexican growers certified to ship avocados
to the US would have to be inspected in Mexico, and then USDA would also check
for pests in packing plants.  Mexican growers would pay for these USDA
inspections.  Mexican avocados could be sent to only to 19 Midwest and
Northeastern states during the months of November to February, when the cold
weather would prevent any of the pests from surviving.</tt><p>
<tt>Canadians pay $0.50 to $0.60 per Mexican avocado in retail stores, while US
consumers often pay $1 each for California avocados.  About five percent of
Mexico's fresh avocados are exported.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans consume about four times more fresh produce per capita than
Americans, in part because fewer Mexican have the freezers and microwaves
associated with frozen vegetables.</tt><p>
<tt>Because of drought, Mexico is expected to import about 12 million tons of
grain in 1996, one-third of Mexico's grain consumption.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first 10 months of 1995, Mexican agricultural exports to the
United States, excluding grains, rose by 42 percent to $ 2.9 billion, while US
agricultural exports to  Mexico fell 44 percent to $ 724 million.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, Mexico exported $69 billion worth of products to the US and
Canada--its NAFTA partners took 86 percent of Mexico's exports.  But one half
of Mexico's exports came from maquiladoras, and 70 percent of Mexico's exports
were shipped abroad by 300 companies.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico in mid-June began to distribute a 22-page pamphlet to Central
Americans attempting to enter Mexico illegally that outline their rights,
including their right not to be harassed by Mexican police seeking bribes.  The
pamphlet explains that it is illegal to enter Mexico without proper documents,
but then goes on to say that even illegal foreigners in Mexico have basic human
rights, such as the right to "respectful treatment," and provides telephone
numbers that migrants can call to report abuses. </tt><p>
<tt>The pamphlet advises migrants who suffer abuse to remember the color of the
uniform that the abuser wore, and the license plate number of the vehicle
used.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Immigrant
Integration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In July 1997, several reports on the economic progress of recent Latino
immigrants were released, and all were pessimistic about upward mobility for
Latino immigrants with little education.</tt><p>
<tt>Many immigrants arrive in the US without English, and largely for that
reason they initially earn less than US-born residents who are similar to them
in years of schooling, age etc.  Barry Chiswick of the University of Illinois
at Chicago found, in studies completed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, that
immigrant men initially earned 10 percent less than similar US-born men.
However, the extra drive and ambition that prompts immigrants to migrate
enabled them to close the earnings gap after an average 13 years in the US, and
provided them with six percent higher earnings after 23 years in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas argued that Chiswick was mixing together the characteristics
of the immigrants, and the general state of the economy.  In effect, Borjas
argued that Chiswick was generalizing from a unique set of
circumstances--highly skilled Asian immigrants who arrived during the 1950s and
1960s, when the US economy boomed.  </tt><p>
<tt>Borjas argued that immigrants arriving in the 1980s were more likely to be
refugees or unskilled workers who would not catch up in earnings to similar US
workers in a slow growing economy in which wages for unskilled workers were
falling.</tt><p>
<tt>Studies competed in the 1980s and 1990s show that both Chiswick and Borjas
are correct, each for some portion of the immigrant population.  For example, a
Rand Corporation study released in July 1996, "The Mixed Economic Progress of
Immigrants", reports that the median weekly earnings of immigrant men fell from
99 percent of those of native-born workers in 1970 to 89 percent in 1990,
supporting the conclusions of Borjas.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, immigrant men from China, Japan and Korea increased their earnings
relative to US born men between 1970 and 1990, jumping from average earnings
that were 88 percent as much as similar US born men earned in 1970, to 110
percent of the earnings of similar US born men in 1990, supporting
Chiswick.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican immigrant men aged 25 to 34 lost ground relative to similar US-born
men over the past two decades.  Those arriving between 1965 and 1969 earned 63
percent as much as similar US-born men in 1970.  By 1990, the earnings of this
same group of immigrant men were only 57 percent as much as similar US-born
men.  </tt><p>
<tt>These data suggest that Mexican immigrants enter the US with education,
language, and skill disadvantages, and that these disadvantages persist and may
even widen over time.</tt><p>
<tt>One reason for the drop in relative wages is that many Mexicans are
unskilled, and the earnings of all unskilled workers in the US economy have
been falling.  The earnings of foreign-born men in the bottom tenth of the US
work force--when arrayed by earnings--have fallen to 63 percent of their US
counterparts' earnings from 94 percent in the 1970s and 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Rand study, Mexican immigrants who arrived in the US in
the late 1970s typically earned about half as much as similar US-born
residents.  In 1990, they still earned only about half as much as similar
US-born residents.</tt><p>
<tt>The Rand study was based on data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Censuses, as
well as a 1980-86 survey of 10 and 12th graders.  The education data show that
80 percent of Asian high school graduates go on to college, versus 50 percent
of Hispanic high school graduates.  In California, about 25 percent of the 15
to 17 year olds born in Mexico were not enrolled in school in 1990, versus five
percent for other immigrant teens.  By the age of 15, many Mexican immigrants
have already been out of school for two years.</tt><p>
<tt>One critic of the Rand study argued that Latinos are rational when they do
not attend school, since the janitorial and service jobs open to them do not
require much education.  He argued instead for raising the minimum wage to
increase Latino earnings.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Department of Labor released its second analysis of data on the 1.6
million persons legalized under the 1987-88 program that permitted persons who
were illegally in the US since January 1, 1982 to become legal immigrants.
(The 1.1 million unauthorized aliens who became legal immigrants under the
Special Agricultural Worker or SAW program were generally much less educated,
and were not included in the DOL survey).</tt><p>
<tt>The report concludes that legalized aliens interviewed in 1992 "face
extraordinary obstacles to achieving the American Dream," in part linked to the
fact that, after ten years in the US, about 25 percent do not speak much
English.  Despite high labor force participation rates, relatively few of the
legalized aliens were able to move beyond the restaurant and construction jobs
they held as illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Legalized aliens were not eligible for most welfare programs for five
years, or until 1993.  However, when the survey was done in 1992, about 60
percent of the newly legalized sample families had assets of less than $1000,
which would qualify them for many benefit programs.  As the barriers to
benefits fall, the survey found that many of the newly-legalized are beginning
to apply for and receive benefits, although the proportion of the newly
legalized receiving benefits is lower than for similarly poor US-born
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL surveyed 4,000 legalized aliens in 1989 and 1992, including 69 percent
from Mexico and 15 percent from Central American countries.  About 58 percent
of the pre-82 amnesty applicants lived in California, followed by 13 percent in
Texas, and seven percent in New York.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 40 percent of the legalized aliens reported that no one in their
family had private health insurance.  It found heavy usage of emergency,
maternal and child health-care programs, and reported that 25 percent of the
legalized families have a child in reduced-price school-lunch programs.</tt><p>
<tt>According to journalist Robert Samuelson, the US may be "importing poverty"
through immigration.  He estimates that 25 to 50 percent of the increase in US
poverty since 1970 may be due to immigration--six million of the 15 million
increase in the number of poor persons between 1973 and 1994 were Hispanic;
about 40 percent of the nine million increase between 1987 and 1994 in the
number of Americans without health insurance were Hispanic, and the proportion
of Hispanics among the poorest 20 percent of Americans rose from five percent
in 1974 to 12 percent in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Samuelson, immigration aggravated rather than caused these
socio-economic problems;  US "indicators of national well-being" are depressed
when poorly educated immigrants arrive.  They and their children may do better,
as past waves of immigrants have, but success is not guaranteed.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Brit</a>ain
Debates Asylum Change</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The British government has been trying to reduce the number of asylum
seekers, and to limit their access to social services while their applications
are pending.  Britain is the only European country in which asylum applications
are rising, to 44,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The government has attempted this by administrative and legislative means.
In January 1996, the British government introduced new rules that would make
immigrants who did not apply for asylum upon entry ineligible for welfare
benefits.  It estimates that such a rule would save at least US $410 million
per year by excluding from benefits those who did not apply immediately.  One
June 21, a British Court of Appeal struck down the rule in unusually fervent
language.</tt><p>
<tt>The government then resorted to legislative means, introducing amendments
to pending legislation to enact the one-day rule.  The House of Lords balked,
choosing instead to give applicants three days in which to apply, but on July
15, the House of Commons rejected the Lords' amendment and supported the
government's more restrictive requirement. </tt><p>
<tt>On July 15, the Archbishop of Canterbury asked the government not to
eliminate welfare benefits for asylum seekers whose applications are pending.
The Archbishop warned that the proposed statute would mean that many genuine
asylum seekers would suffer unwarranted hardship after losing benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>Several backbench Tory M.P.'s warned the government on July 11 that if it
did not restore the three-day application period for asylum seekers to obtain
welfare, they would vote against the Asylum and Immigration Bill when it comes
up for a final vote.  The House of Lords is expected to decide on July 22
whether to agree to the one-day limit, or fight further for a three-day
application period.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">German</a>
Immigration Reforms
Expected</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration Policy</u>.  Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, Germany's
Commissioner for Foreigners, predicted on June 29 that Germany will soon make
reforms in immigration law.  Before the end of 1998, it will be easier for at
least the children of foreigners born in Germany to become dual nationals, she
said.  According to Schmalz-Jacobsen, most of Germany's 656 members of
Parliament are in favor of changing Germany's nationality laws to reduce the
waiting period before a foreigner can apply for naturalization, and to give
foreigners more rights in the naturalization process.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany's current nationality law, the 1913 Reichs- und
Staatsangehoerigkeitsgesetz, allows for the naturalization of foreigners.
There were about 200,000 naturalizations in 1993, and 260,000 in 1994.  Between
1973 and 1994, about 1.5 million foreigners became German citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>There are two major types of naturalization in Germany.  Ethnic Germans,
so-called "Aussiedler," are Germans abroad who move to Germany, where they have
a right (Anspruch) to German citizenship. There were 233,000 Anspruch
naturalizations in 1994, and 1.1 million since 1973.  The overwhelming number
of naturalizations in Germany are naturalizations of people of German
stock.</tt><p>
<tt>Other foreigners may become German citizens after residence of at least 15
years at the discretion (Ermessen) of the German authorities.  Such
naturalization applications may be rejected if the foreigner has committed a
felony (including prostitution), has less than six years of schooling, has
received welfare payments, or if German authorities deem naturalization to be
"not in the interest of the German state."  The fee for naturalization was
lowered in 1993 to DM500 per adult and DM100 per child.  Foreigners who marry
Germans can apply for naturalization after three years of marriage and
residence.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1993, foreigners between the ages of 16 and 23, who have lived
legally for at least eight years in Germany, and who have at least six years of
German schooling, have been entitled to German citizenship upon request.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 45,000 such "Ermessen," or discretionary, naturalizations in
1993--more than double the 18,000 in 1989.  In 1994, the number of
discretionary naturalizations fell to 26,000.</tt><p>
<tt>In most cases, foreigners wishing to become naturalized German citizens
must give up their current citizenship.  Most West European nations
automatically release their citizens when they naturalize, but a few nations,
notable Turkey, require the completion of military service before a young man
can give up his citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990s, of the 450,000 marriages that have taken place each year in
Germany, 390,000 have been between two Germans, 10,000 between two foreigners
(with at least one partner living in Germany), and 50,000 of a German with a
foreigner.  In about 25,000 marriages each year, a German woman marries a
foreign man--Turks, ex-Yugoslavs, Italians, and Americans together comprise
almost half of the foreign husbands.  In another 25,000 marriages each year, a
German man marries a foreign woman--Poles, Thais, and ex-Yugoslavs together are
about one-third of the foreign wives.</tt><p>
<tt>The German weekly "Der Spiegel" in June summarized the work of several
German researchers under the headline "Germany needs foreigners."</tt><p>
<tt>The article opened by contradicting German political convention in
asserting that Germany is a country of immigration (Einwanderungsland), and
that it is time for Germany to recognize that fact by enacting an immigration
law, and creating an immigration department to administer the law.  The SPD,
FDP, and the Greens have made immigration proposals, although the SPD speaks of
Zuwanderung rather than using the common German word, Einwanderung, which has a
negative connotation for voters.</tt><p>
<tt>In each of the political parties' proposed immigration laws, a commission
would be charged with setting an annual ceiling on the number of newcomers to
be admitted to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Many observers put the "immigration need" of Germany at 300,000 to 400,000
newcomers per year. According to a 1994 estimate, 1.1 million foreigners and
ethnic Germans entered Germany to settle, and 740,000 Germans and foreigners
left, leaving Germany with a net 330,000 newcomers--180,000 ethnic Germans, and
150,000 net new foreign residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Some politicians favor reducing the number of ethnic Germans to make room
for a larger number of other foreigners.  During the Spring 1996 elections in
southwestern Germany, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine argued that the country could
not afford to accept 220,000 ethnic Germans each year.  The FDP has proposed
that the 218,000 ethnic Germans admitted in 1995 be reduced in future years by
about 10 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Several economists argue that Germany's economic miracle is linked its
immigrants, and that Germany needs more young and mobile foreigners to sustain
its welfare state.  One estimate is that, in 1992, foreigners and ethnic
Germans paid DM32 billion in taxes, and received DM18 billion in tax-supported
services (there are no data on ethnic Germans, since they enter statistical
systems as Germans).  Another study argued that two-thirds of all foreigners
who found jobs since 1988 took jobs that Germans refused.</tt><p>
<tt>In one proposed immigration system, employers would bid against one another
by offering a fee to the government to obtain one or more of a annual quota of
foreign professionals.  Successful bidders would then receive permission to
import the foreigners that they recruit.</tt><p>
<tt>Some demographers argue that Germany needs foreigners to keep the
population from shrinking, from 82 million in 1996 to a projected 73 million in
2020, and 39 million in 2050.  In order to keep the German labor force at its
current level of about 41 million, it is estimated that Germany will need to
accept an average 400,000 immigrants annually through the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Aussiedler/Jews.</u>  Two groups have special privileges for settling in
Germany, ethnic Germans and Jews.  In 1939, an estimated 8.6 million ethnic
Germans lived outside the German Reich, mostly in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.  Today, an estimated three to 10 million remain, with most estimates in
the three to four million range.</tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic Germans (Aussiedler) living in the ex-USSR have the right to enter
Germany, but the burden of proof is on them to prove that they are in fact
descendants of Germans settlers.  Until 1990, ethnic Germans could move to
Germany and then prove that their ancestry allowed them to stay.  However, when
in 1990 almost 400,000 such people arrived, fears of a mass influx arose and
procedures were changed to require ethnic Germans to prove their ancestry
before emigrating, and the maximum number allowed to move to Germany was set at
220,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Today, most Aussiedler are from Russian and Kazakstan.  They arrive in
Germany as Russian and Kazak citizens, and they are permitted to keep their
Russian and Kazak citizenship even after they become German citizens.  Some
have returned to Russia and Kazakhstan.</tt><p>
<tt>Since World War II, Germany has had a policy of accepting Jews from the
USSR/ex-USSR on the ground that the destruction of European Jewry by Germany
imposed a duty to take in Jews suffering discrimination.  Recently, Germany's
Development Minister suggested that Germany may no longer need to accept Jews
from the ex-USSR, since conditions there have improved for them.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 45,000 Jews, and 1.5 million ethnic Germans, have migrated to Germany
since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Data on Foreigners</u>. There were about five million foreigners among
the 79 million residents of united Germany on October 3, 1990, and all but
100,000 of them were in what was West Germany.  Data on foreigners in Germany
has since 1959 come from a central register--Auslaenderzentralregister or
AZR--that collects data from the local authorities with whom residents register
when moving in or out of a city.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some foreigners are believed to have left Germany without de-registering,
so the seven million registered foreigners in the AZR in December 1995 may be
an overestimate by several hundred thousand.</tt><p>
<tt>About half of the foreigners in Germany in 1995 had lived in the country
for 10 years or more, and half of these had lived in Germany for 20 or more
years.  Some 2.5  million foreigners settled in Germany between 1988 and
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners are about nine percent of Germany's residents, and their
proportion is rising, mainly through natural increase.  About 100,000 or 12
percent of the 800,000 births in Germany each year are "foreign
children."</tt><p>
<tt>Turks are the largest group of foreigners--the two million Turks are about
28 percent of all foreigners in Germany, followed by 1.3 million persons from
ex-Yugoslavia, 19 percent; 572,000 Italians, eight percent; 356,000 Greeks,
five percent; and 263,000 Poles, four percent.  About one-fourth of the
foreigners in Germany come from one of the other 14 EU member nations.</tt><p>
<tt>There were two million asylum-related foreigners living in Germany in 1993,
and 1.75 million in 1994.  Of the asylum-related foreigners living in Germany
in 1994, only 267,000 were recognized refugees and their families.  Another
650,000 were "de facto" refugees, 415,000 had pending asylum applications, and
350,000 had a temporary safe-haven status in Germany, mostly because of trouble
at home.</tt><p>
<tt>About three-fourths of all foreigners lived in four of Germany's 16 states
in 1994.  North Rhine-Westphalia had 1.9 million foreign residents,
Baden-Wuerttemberg had 1.2 million, Bavaria had 1.1 million, and Hesse had
790,000 residents. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians</u>.  There are 320,000 Bosnians in Germany, 86,000 in Sweden,
80,000 in Austria, 36,000 in Italy, 28,000 in Denmark, 25,000 in Switzerland,
18,000 in Norway, and 15,000 in France.</tt><p>
<tt>Starting on October 1, 1996, Bosnians in Germany are supposed to return to
Bosnia, but it now appears that this will be difficult to accomplish.</tt><p>
<tt>First, the Dayton agreement says that Bosnians have the right to return to
their homes, but up to half of the Bosnians in Germany are Muslims from areas
now under Serbian control.  Second, the Bosnian government is demanding that
young men who avoided military service pay DM1,000 to DM10,000 in fines, which
may discourage returns.</tt><p>
<tt>Off-the-record, German officials complain that they do not want their
country to be forced into paying three times for Bosnia's civil war--first to
care for Bosnians in Germany, second in contributions to the EU-reconstruction
fund, and third in special payments to promote the return of Bosnians in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese</u>.  On July 5, Germany announced that Vietnam had approved
the return of 3,000 Vietnamese.  Germany submits the names of persons to be
returned, and Vietnam checks to be sure that they are Vietnamese.  There is not
yet a timetable for the repatriation process.</tt><p>
<tt>Meanwhile, an article in Reuters said that many illegal Vietnamese want to
leave the cigarette-selling underworld of Berlin to return home.  Some say they
fear arrest, others worry about the gangs that control the smuggling of
cigarettes. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum.</u>  In June 1996, there were 8,234 asylum applications, the
smallest number since June 1989.  About seven percent of the applications
handled in June 1996 resulted in a foreigner receiving asylum in Germany, and
another five percent of the foreigners were allowed to stay temporarily in
Germany--88 percent of the applications were rejected.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1996, it was reported that 74 of Germany's 31,500 Catholic and
Protestant churches had become sanctuaries for 230 foreigners, half children,
whom the government was seeking to deport.</tt><p>
<tt>In the "14 steps to the new asylum law," a leading journalist, Heribert
Prantl, reviews the history leading up to the narrowing of the right to asylum
in Germany.  Prantl began with Article 16 of the German Basic Law--persons who
are politically persecuted can obtain asylum--and then noted that, in the guest
worker era, there were few asylum applications--5,595 in 1973.  As the number
of asylum applicants climbed to 108,000 in 1980, there was talk of asylum
reform, but it was relatively easy to reduce the number of applicants by
requiring Turks, who were half of the applicants, to obtain visas before coming
to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, there were 193,000 asylum applications, and Germans began to say
that Germany had too many problems to deal with the burdens of asylum seekers.
In 1991, attacks on foreigners began first at Hoyerswerda and Huenxe.  Those
who opposed changing the constitution in a manner that restricted asylum said
that Germany should not give in to anti-foreigner sentiment stimulated by the
radical right.</tt><p>
<tt>In the spring of 1991, the SPD proposed an immigration law with annual
quotas.</tt><p>
<tt>Because Social Democrats have an historically based interest and sympathy
for people in need of refuge, the SPD was slow to accept the need for a change
in the asylum law.  The ruling CDU-CSU-FDP coalition wanted to amend the
constitution, but the SPD argued that procedural changes could resolve the
issue.  In August 1992, foreigners were attacked in Rostock, and the SPD, in a
fall 1992 meeting, agreed that the constitution must be amended in a manner
that reduced the number of asylum applicants living in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>On May 29, 1993, five Turks were killed in an arson attack on their home in
Solingen.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 26, 1993, the German Parliament approved the asylum reform by a vote
of 521 to 132--the individual right to asylum remained in the German Basic Law,
but access to asylum in Germany was limited by the "third safe country"
clause-- asylum applicants were expected to apply for asylum in the first safe
country they entered.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is surrounded by safe countries.  Thus, the burden of proof is very
great for applicants from countries recognized as generally safe.  Airport
rules permit an accelerated hearing on applications from persons arriving
without documents at German airports.  If they fail the test, they can be sent
back immediately.</tt><p>
<tt>The new asylum law went into effect on July 1, 1993, and was approved by
the German constitutional court on May 14, 1996.  Germany spent a record DM15
billion on asylum seekers in 1992; in 1995, the cost of operating the asylum
system was about DM8 billion.</tt><p>
<tt>About 2.3 million of Germany's 36 million households received welfare
assistance at the end of 1994, including 450,000 foreigners.  The number of
foreigners receiving welfare payments dropped by 200,000 between 1993 and 1994
because of changes effective July 1, 1993 that prevented many asylum applicants
from receiving cash assistance.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Residence and Work Permits</u>.  All foreign residents need an
Aufenhaltsgenehmigung, or residence permit.  There are four major
types--Aufenthaltsbefugnis, or Duldung (toleration) to stay in Germany granted
for humanitarian reasons, a status that can be revoked at any time;
Aufenthaltsbewilligung, or the right to stay in Germany for a specific purpose,
such as to study; Aufenthaltserlaubnis, or permission to stay, usually for one
year; and, Aufenthaltsberechtigung, or permanent residence status.</tt><p>
<tt>Most foreigners must live in Germany one year before obtaining a work
permit, and most foreigners initially obtain one- to- three year work permits
(allgemeine Arbeitserlaubnis) after the local employment office certifies that
there are no unemployed local workers available to fill the job for which the
foreigner is seeking permission to fill.  </tt><p>
<tt>The work permits usually restrict a foreign worker to a specific job with a
named employer.  Other work permits restrict the localities, industries and
occupations in which the permit-holder may work.  Most foreigners must live in
Germany for at least eight years before they can be self-employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Work permits can also be unlimited, or "unbefristet," in time, which means
that the foreigner is allowed to work in Germany as long as she has a valid
residence permit, and special, or "sonder," which means that the foreigner can
work for any employer and in any job without the labor office first certifying
that unemployed workers are not already available.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, some 2.2 million foreign workers were employed and enrolled in the
German social security system, including 605,000 Turks, 420,000 from former
Yugoslavia, and 203,000 Italians.  Another 400,000 foreign workers were
unemployed, including 21 percent of the Turkish workers, and 18 percent of the
Italian workers.  Most of these employed foreign workers are employed in
manufacturing (884,000) or services (573,000). In 1994, an average 16 percent
of foreign workers were unemployed, versus nine percent of all workers in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market.</u>  In mid-June, the German construction employers
association withdrew from the umbrella German employers' association to protest
the umbrella association's failure to approve a minimum wage for all workers on
construction sites in Germany.  The construction employers wanted the minimum
wage rule to discourage the employment of an estimated 150,000 cheaper British,
Irish, and Portuguese workers; the employers' association was afraid of setting
a precedent for an industry-wide minimum wage.</tt><p>
<tt>Many German construction firms have gone bankrupt, and more bankruptcies
are feared.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 200,000 non-German EU workers employed in the German
construction industry.  In a critical report, the German newspaper Der
Tagespiegel, on July 1 reported that many of the Poles working legally on
German construction sites under Werkvertraege (subcontracting arrangements
between German general contractors and foreign subcontractors) do not have
workers' compensation insurance--if they are injured on the job, they are
dismissed, so that they lose their right to work in Germany, and they wind up
being responsible for their hospital bills.</tt><p>
<tt>According to some Polish workers, contracts are signed in Poland just
before the workers' departure for Berlin, so that the workers are unaware of
their rights.  Many Werkvertrag workers are expected to work 60 hours per week;
hourly wages range from DM6 to 7, far less than the DM15.73 minimum for a West
German construction worker, and DM11.86 in the East, but far more than Polish
wages, which average about DM350 monthly or DM2 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>According to worker advocates, if the foreign workers honestly report their
long hours and low wages during inspections, they are fired, and thus lose
their work permits.</tt><p>
<tt>About 22,000 Polish workers were working in mid-1996  under Werkvertraege,
half of them in construction.  There are another 7,000 Hungarian workers
employed in Germany under Werkvertraege, 5,900 Turks, 5,100 Croats, 4,200
Romanians, 2,900 Czechs, 1,700 Bulgarians, 1,600 Slovakians, and 1,000
Bosnians.  </tt><p>
<tt>The German union federation DGB estimates that, for every legal worker
employed under a Werkvertrag, there are another six to 10 illegal foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, foreigners may enter Germany to work seasonally--defined as a
stay in Germany of up to 90 days.  Some 140,000 Polish seasonal workers were
employed in Germany in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 550,000 residents of the former East Germany commuted to jobs
in the former West Germany (340,000) or West Berlin (210,000) in November 1994,
down from 600,000 in November 1993, but still almost three times more than in
November 1990.  The commuting workers have average earnings of DM2,300 per
month, versus DM2,000 for non-commuters.  About 30 percent of the commuters
live in what was East Berlin. </tt><p>
<tt>There seems to be considerable movement into and out of commuter status. In
1994, 150,000 former East German residents stopped commuting, and 100,000 began
commuting.  About one in seven East German commuters is employed in West German
construction.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 1, 1996, 236,000 east German manufacturing workers began to receive
the same wages as their west German colleagues.  However, workers in the east
will continue to work 39 hours each week, four hours longer than in the
west.</tt><p>
<tt>A recent report from the Hessen state labor office indicates that most of
the jobs in the underground economy (Schwarzarbeit) are filled by German
citizens, not foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 2.6 million unregistered jobs in Germany.  Unions
blame high taxes and living costs for increased Schwarzarbeit.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Berlin</u>.  The 400,000 foreigners in Berlin are about 11 percent of
the city's 3.5 million residents.  The foreigners include 138,000 Turks, 70,000
persons from ex-Yugoslavia, 26,000 Poles, and 46,000 residents from other EU
countries.  Berlin has more foreigners than any other German city.</tt><p>
<tt>According to one projection, Berlin will grow slowly to 3.8 million
residents by the year 2010, but the number of foreigners will increase faster,
to 575,000, and amount to 15 percent of Berlin's population.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of Berlin's foreigners are in the former West Berlin--350,000 or 90
percent--making foreigners 16 percent of the former West Berlin's population.
Most of the foreigners live in so-called Altbaugebieten (neighborhoods of old
apartment buildings) in a few sections of West Berlin--Kreuzberg (33 percent
foreigners), Neuk&ouml;lln, and Wedding (27 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Among major German cities, Frankfurt has the highest percentage of
foreigners, 192,000 or 28 percent; followed by Stuttgart with 142,000 or  23
percent; Munich with 287,000 or 22 percent; and Cologne with 187,000 or 18
percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, for the first time, more than half the applicants for public
housing in Frankfurt were foreigners.  The Frankfurt housing office is required
to provide two apartments to Germans for each apartment awarded to
foreigners--the foreigners' quota of scarce public housing is 30
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Turks in Berlin have an unemployment rate that is twice the rate for German
nationals.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin and surrounding Brandenburg, a special task force (Gemeinsame
Ermittlungsgruppe Schwarzarbeit or GES) that includes representatives of the
police, labor department, tax office, health authorities, and customs was
established in 1994 to check employers for  unauthorized foreign workers and
other violations in the underground labor market.  About 9,300 persons were
fined in 955 businesses, including 3,400 foreigners.</tt><p>

Workers in

Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>As European countries such as Germany reduce illegal immigration and access
to asylum, migrants from Asia and Africa are being stranded in Eastern Europe.
An estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Sudanese, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Kurds and
other foreigners are in Romania--35,000 foreigners have been caught trying to
cross Romania's borders illegally since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the foreigners are men trying to reach Germany and work--wages in
Romania average only about $100 per month.  However, Romania complains that it
cannot afford to repatriate the foreigners whom it apprehends, since the cost
of flying an illegal immigrant home is often $5,000, while Romania spends only
$1,000 per year to detain illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Republic has 10.3 million residents, and five million workers,
including 160,000 foreign residents, and 150,000 foreign workers.  The 112,000
foreign workers with work permits include 60,000 from Slovakia, 27,000 from
Ukraine, and 12,000 from Poland--there are also 37,000 "independent" foreign
workers in the Czech republic--the largest group are 7,700 Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners in the Czech Republic with permanent or long-term
residence permits has risen almost fivefold in the past five years.  In 1995,
6,674 foreigners were granted permanent residence--31 percent were Poles.
</tt><p>
<tt>In neighboring Poland, there are believed to be 50,000 to 200,000
foreigners illegally working, and only 11,000 legal foreign workers.  In 1995,
4,000 foreigners applied for permanent residence in Poland.</tt><p>
<tt>Poland's economy is booming--the economy expanded by seven percent in
1995--and unemployment, at 14 percent, is down from a peak 16 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 35 percent of all work permits for foreigners in Poland went to
managers in 1995, and another 15 percent to teachers and trainers.  According
to reports, Poland welcomes foreign language teachers, but applications for
other professionals are scrutinized carefully.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Polish Employment Department has only 16 inspectors for the entire
Warsaw district, making it difficult to locate illegal foreign workers.  Polish
employers can be fined zl 5,000 ($1,850) for each undocumented worker, but most
foreign workers refuse to fill out the appropriate paper work and simply
disappear, according to department officials. </tt><p>
<tt>Since July 1995, the enforcement department has found only 100 illegal
workers.  After being detected, it is estimated that half of the illegal
workers return to their home countries, 25 percent find other jobs, and 25
percent apply for work permits to make themselves legal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, 841 foreigners sought asylum in Poland, and 600 requested asylum n
the first five months of 1996.  About 20 percent of those who request asylum in
Poland are permitted to stay, versus less than five percent in Germany.</tt><p>

<tt>Since January 1995, there have been over 80 suicide attempts, 20 of them
successful, by asylum seekers in the Netherlands.  The European refugee
organization, Participating Refugees in Europe, says that the suicides show how
heavily the mental strain weighs on refugees in uncertain status. </tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands' justice state secretary reported that of the 141 asylum
seekers who were ordered to a repatriation center in a northern province, 65
did not show up.  Of the 76 who did register at the center, 27 disappeared
shortly afterwards.  The center prepares asylum seekers whose applications have
been processed and rejected for repatriation.  Many have no identity papers.
</tt><p>
<tt>On June 28, the Netherlands Justice Minister announced new measures to
prevent smugglers from profiting from smuggling asylum seekers into the
country.  About 75 percent of the asylum seekers arriving in the Netherlands
have paid a travel agent between 5,000 to 30,000 guilders.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government plans to raise the current prison sentence for human
smuggling from one to four years, and impose fines on airlines and other
transport companies that bring foreigners without the proper documentation into
the country.  Currently, 60 percent of asylum seekers have false or no
documents.</tt><p>

employed in Thailand after they are registered.  The foreign workers receive a
card similar to the one given to workers awaiting deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai employers with illegal immigrant workers must register them as
"illegal workers" with the local police, bail them out, and then register them
at the provincial labor office between July 1996 and June 1997.  The foreign
workers with permits are to be paid the same wages, and have the same
protections, as Thai workers.  All are expected to leave Thailand after two
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The regulations apply to an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrant workers in
39 of Thailand's 76 provinces--Kanchanaburi, Krabi, Kamphaeng Phet, Khon Kaen,
Chanthaburi, Chachoengsao, Chon Buri, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Chumphon, Tak,
Trat, Trang, Nakhon Pathom, Nakhon Sawan, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Si
Thammarat, Narathiwat, Prachuab Khiri Khan, Pattani, Phangnga, Ayutthaya,
Phetchaburi, Phitsanulok, Phuket, Mae Hong Son, Ratchaburi, Rayong, Ranong, Lop
Buri, Suphan Buri, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram, Surat Thani,
Songkhla, Satun, Uthai Thani, and Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>As soon as the amnesty was announced, several agents began advertising in
Burma, offering to help workers find jobs in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai Labor Congress threatened a nationwide strike if the government
did not reverse its plans to legalize foreign workers.  The Labor Congress said
that the amnesty will result in hundreds of thousands of Thai workers losing
their jobs, and lead to social problems. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai Chamber of Commerce disagreed, saying that giving illegal
immigrants work permits could ease the country's labor shortage, and not affect
local workers, because the foreigners only took jobs that Thais refuse.  Thai
employers argue that the country is short 1.4 million workers.  The Thai
government denied it had plans to allow employers to recruit additional
unskilled foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>A National Security Council official expressed worries that immigration
could threaten Thailand's national security.  One official claimed that
immigrants destroyed natural resources along the border, raised crime and
prostitution rates, and created pockets of minorities, all while carrying
malaria and elephantiasis.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Security Council plans to force all illegal workers out of the
country by 1998.  The NSC hopes that stepped up border enforcement and
sanctions to be place within the next three months, and reduce illegal entry.
The Task Force of Commerce and Industry Council has recommended to the Thai
government that illegal immigrants pay a 10,000 baht surety to discourage them
from settling in urban areas.  </tt><p>
<tt>Thai migrant workers returning home from the Middle East are buying "cheap
gold" in Dubai markets as the most convenient way to bring back their earnings,
competition keeps margins on gold at two to three percent.  South African
krugerrands are then sold by migrants in Bangkok. </tt><p>
<tt>Thailand and Laos have been unable to agree on the fate of about 2,000
Laotian refugees in Thailand who do not meet US resettlement criteria.
Thailand wants to forcibly deport the Laotians, but the Laotian government has
ruled out deportation, while Thailand threatens to stop sheltering and feeding
the Laotians.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">Camps
for Vietnamese</a>
Close</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 30, 1996, most of the camps for boat people from Vietnam were
closed, ending a 20-year saga--the camps were originally supposed to be closed
in 1995.  However, there are still about 31,000 Vietnamese in camps, including
18,000 in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong has until June 30, 1997 to return the
Vietnamese in its camps.</tt><p>
<tt>After the Vietnam war ended in 1975, some 1.5 million people fled Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos, including 1.2 million who were resettled in the US.  Many
Vietnamese fled Vietnam in small boats, and wound up in camps in nearby
countries.  Of those who fled Vietnam, some 760,000 were resettled in third
countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the Comprehensive Plan of Action adopted in 1989, persons who left
their countries of citizenship after March 14, 1989 were no longer presumed to
be refugees fleeing political persecution.  Instead, they were housed in camps,
and interviewed by countries willing to resettle them to determine if they were
economic or political refugees.  About 80,000 Vietnamese were repatriated since
1989; most agreed to return voluntarily with a $240 integration grant and $50
in pocket money from the UNHCR.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN High Commission for Refugees has spent $350 million on the
Vietnamese in the camps since 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the Vietnamese have been in camps for seven to 10 years, and they
must return to Vietnam in order to apply to join families in the US, Canada,
and Australia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government will allow 1,800 Vietnamese asylum-seekers who
have been living for eight years in a detention camp to remain in the
Philippines.  The Center for Assistance to Displaced People has promised to
care for and help resettle those who do not want to return to Vietnam.  The
Catholic Church in the Philippines argued strongly against forced
repatriation.</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that half of the detained asylum-seekers reportedly would
rather return to Vietnam than remain in the Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam receives an estimated $600 million annually in remittances from
Vietnamese abroad.  However, overseas Vietnamese, known as Viet Kieu, have
invested little in Vietnam--they want the government to deal with the return of
property confiscated after 1975 when North Vietnamese forces took control of
Saigon, prompting an exodus of some two million people.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam has denied that it will restrict visas for travel to the country.
Visitors to Hanoi's embassies and consulates around the world reported that
visas were not being given out for travel to Vietnam in June.  The halting of
visas coincides with the Eighth Communist Party congress in Vietnam.  In 1991,
during the last party Congress, some foreigners were asked to leave the
country.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 6,000 Laotians are still registered as refugees in Thailand with the
UNHCR, despite the resettlement of more than 300,000.  Almost 260,000
Cambodians were resettled or repatriated before elections held in Cambodia in
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be about 100 Vietnamese and 300 Chinese working
legally in Laos, and hundreds more illegal Vietnamese.  On December 2, 1995,
Laos launched a major crackdown on illegal workers--mostly Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>The minimum wage in Laos is 2,000 kip per day, but Vietnamese will
reportedly work for 1,000 kip.</tt><p>

in Asia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The International Labor Office (ILO) estimates there are at least 1.5
million female workers from Asia employed outside their country of citizenship,
most of whom work as domestic servants.  There are an estimated 700,000 illegal
female migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 320,000 Asian women leave their country each year for jobs,
mostly to the Middle East and Singapore and Hong Kong.  Most of the women leave
Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and India.</tt><p>
<tt>Women are the majority of workers leaving many of these countries.  About
69 percent of Sri Lanka's migrants, 65 percent of Indonesia's migrants, and 55
percent of Filipino migrants, including 500,000 maids, are women.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be at least 150,000 maids in Hong Kong, including
100,000 Filipinas employed legally.</tt><p>
<tt>Only Egypt, Morocco, the Philippines, Seychelles, Chile, Mexico and Sri
Lanka have signed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
of  Migrant Workers and their Families, unanimously approved in 1990 by the UN
General Assembly.  The convention must be ratified by 20 countries before
coming into force.</tt><p>
<tt>A UN expert group meeting on Violence against Women Migrant Workers in
Manila in May 1996 concluded with a call for governments supplying or employing
migrant labor to sign agreements that provide better protection for women
workers against abuse and exploitation.</tt><p>
<tt>Sending countries have had little success preventing their nationals from
working in particular countries, or setting minimum wages and other conditions
for them.</tt><p>
<tt>Many countries specifically exclude domestic work from their labor
laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines announced that Filipina maids in Singapore could give their
passports to their employers for safekeeping, reversing an earlier decision to
have the maids, and not their employers, hold onto their passports.  Singapore
employers argued that they needed to hold the maids passports to safeguard
their S$2000 bond.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 13, 1996, the Philippines announced new guidelines for Filipina
maids in Singapore, including a minimum monthly salary of at least $300 and a
workday of 16 hours or less.  The going salary for maids in Singapore is $210
per month.  Singapore employers must in addition pay a $231 per month
government tax for each foreign maid they employ.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government reported that the Migrant Workers and Overseas
Filipinos Act of 1995 resulted in a 60 percent drop in illegal recruitment in
the Philippines.  Some Philippine labor officials are recommending that the
government redirect overseas workers from Hong Kong to Spain--there are about
100,000 Filipinos in Hong Kong, and 90,000 in Spain.  Monthly wages average
$1,200 in Spain, versus $700 in Hong Kong.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Australia</a>
Cuts Immigration 10
Percent</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Australian government announced the first week of July that it plans to
cut 1996/1997 non-humanitarian immigration by 10 percent, to 74,000 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government also proposed admitting 700 family reunion
migrants if they agree to settle in specially designated areas.  The plan would
require migrants to pay a A$30,000 bond which would be forfeited if they moved
to Sydney, Melbourne and parts of Queensland, where many migrants have settled
in the past.  Approximately 45 percent of Australia's new migrants now settle
in Sydney.</tt><p>
<tt>The proposed program would also impose a two-year waiting period on new
migrants applying for Social Security benefits, saving the government $600
million over three years.  In addition, migrants would be required to pass an
English language test. </tt><p>
<tt>Migrants paying the bond will be able to immigrate quicker.  An additional
500 places would be set aside for a trial program to match up skilled migrants
with employers in regional Australia.  The government said that the bond system
would apply to a new category of 1,200 visas that is being developed.</tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic groups said the new program violated the UN Convention on Human
Rights and harkened back to the past "white Australia" policies.  The Asian
community is concerned that the English language skills required could reduce
the number of immigrants from non-English-speaking countries.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 excluded non-European migrants
during Australia's gold rush, and lasted for 70 years.</tt><p>
<tt>The 20,000 Chinese students who were in Australia during the Tiananmen
Square crackdown on June 4, 1989 were give Australian passports, and they have
now become very desirable marriage partners for Chinese in China.  Some have
returned to China for visits, and been offered up to $30,000 for a marriage of
convenience that would enable their "spouse" to migrate to Australian.  </tt><p>
<tt>Authorities say it is hard to determine how many bogus marriages have
occurred, but they note that the number of applications for spouse visas has
ballooned by more than 30 percent in the past 12 months.  Australia plans to
admit up to 50,500 members of settled residents' families in 1995-96, most of
them spouses and fiancees.</tt><p>
<tt>Almost half of the immigration prosecutions in the first half of 1996
involved immigration marriage fraud.  In 1994-95, Australian authorities
rejected 1057 applications for marriage visas on the grounds that the
relationships were not genuine.</tt><p>
<tt>In July, 1996, a Sydney-based migration agent was sentenced to 18 months
jail and fined $283,200 for arranging bogus marriages.  The agents introduce
visiting Chinese to Australians, then arrange the marriage and complete
immigration forms for a fee of up to $16,000.  </tt><p>

the border is closed, or about $75 per worker per day, including the multiplier
effects of Gaza workers spending the $20 to $40 per day that they typically
earned in Israeli fields and construction sites.  Some Gaza workers said that,
even after paying $300 bribes for work permits, being employed in Israel still
generated higher earnings than employment in Gaza.</tt><p>
<tt>Instead of Palestinians, Israel is importing Romanian, Thai, and other
foreign workers.  There are about 100,000 legal foreign workers in Israel, and
an estimated 100,000 illegal foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>A recent police report indicates that the Romanian, Thai and other foreign
workers imported to work in Israel have contributed to a steady rise in
violence, alcoholism, prostitution and crime.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Romanian Tourism Minister charged that Romanian workers are being
mistreated while they are in Israel.  Romanians, he said, receive half the
salary of Israelis performing similar jobs and have intolerable living
conditions.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC21">US-
Mexican Cooperation on
Immigration?</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>A June 14-15 conference organized by Frank D. Bean, Rodolofo de la Garza,
Bryan Roberts, and Sidney Weintraub and the University of Texas at Austin asked
what the US and Mexico might do to respond to the apparent US "crisis" over
especially illegal Mexican migration to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Three background facts seem important:</tt><p>
<tt>1. The number of especially illegal Mexican immigrants seems to be
increasing despite new Border Patrol operations meant to discourage illegal
entrants, or at least push them to attempt entry in areas where apprehension is
easier.  The number of Mexican-born persons in the US increased by 400,000
between March 1994 and March 1995, a period in which legal immigration was
about 100,000.  By one calculation, at least 200,000 Mexicans become illegal
residents each year--160,000 who entered without inspection, and 40,000 who
overstayed visas.</tt><p>
<tt>2. Mexico is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been accompanied
by a jump in unemployment and falling real wages, which is one reason why it
appears that over half of the unauthorized Mexican immigrants headed for the US
come from Mexico City.  At the same time, beatings of Mexican nationals in the
US, and crashes involving smugglers, have made the Mexican government very
sensitive to the treatment of some Mexican nationals in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>3. There was much praise for the consultations on migration issues that
have already taken place, and hopes for more such discussions.  However, there
seemed to be less consensus that the US and Mexico could "negotiate" a solution
to the migration crisis.  For example, there was no agreement on what the
ultimate aim of any bilateral migration negotiation would be, and what, if
anything, each side would "give up" to persuade the other side to agree to its
position.</tt><p>
<tt>Most US participants were "friends of Mexico," and most argued that Mexico
must "do more" to help prevent unauthorized Mexican migration from souring the
US-Mexican partnership.  Many disagreed with the "official" Mexican position on
illegal migration to the US:  "the Mexican constitution prohibits the Mexican
government from preventing exits, and Mexico respects the right of the US to
control its borders.  Mexico only asks that the US respect the human rights of
all persons within its borders."</tt><p>
<tt>Many US and Mexican participants urged Mexico to, for example, reconsider
its policy of using police to help prevent criminals from preying on aliens,
but not to prevent the exit of the aliens who are the prey of the criminals.
Some Mexicans countered that the US should do more to offset "anti-Mexican
hysteria" in the US by educating the public about the "facts," although there
was not always agreement on what the facts are.</tt><p>
<tt>Perhaps the most realistic perspective on what appears to be a migration
hump--a temporary increase in migration from Mexico--is that it is in the
interest of both Mexico and the US to stick with Mexico's current stabilization
policy, and hope that it will soon accelerate Mexican economic growth enough to
encourage Mexicans to stay home.  It was widely agreed that the current Mexican
stabilization policy is beginning to restore economic and job growth, and that
it would be best to stay the course rather than change policies.</tt><p>
<tt>Among the other highlights of the conference:</tt><p>
<tt>* Mexico's population growth rate has slowed sharply--for the first time,
fewer babies will be born in 1996 than were born in 1995.  However, there  will
continue to be about 1.5 million Mexicans turning 16 every year for the next
decade.</tt><p>
<tt>* Control over illegal immigration can facilitate legal immigration, both
at the border, and in terms of "closing the back door to keep the front door
open."</tt><p>
<tt>* Just as wage gaps do not have to disappear to eliminate incentives for
Mexico-US migration, so illegal immigration over the southern border may
persist, but its level must be reduced to "tolerable levels" to minimize
adverse US reactions.</tt><p>
<tt>* There are few models of "cooperation on migration" that might guide any
US and Mexican negotiations.  For example, the EU's integration of southern
European nations was brought up many times, but it was noted that e.g.,
emigration from Portugal and Spain was "under control" when negotiations for EU
entry began, that both countries had established social safety nets, and
received EU assistance, to help persons displaced during economic
restructuring, and that gaps were not as wide as in North America--population
growth had already converged, and both Portugal and Spain had per capita
incomes that were about one-fourth of French and German levels in the
mid-1980s.  Even so, the EU insisted on a seven-year wait before Portuguese and
Spanish workers got full freedom to seek work in the EU rights.</tt><p>
<tt>* Both US and Mexican participants may have read too much into Prop. 187 in
California, and the incidents involving aliens along the border.  First, it was
noted that the NUMBER of illegal aliens in the US appears to be increasing even
as estimates of the number shrink--in the early 1980s, there was talk of 12 to
20 million illegal aliens in the US, versus current estimates of 3.2 million in
October, 1992, and increasing by 300,000 per year.  Second, it was emphasized
that Prop. 187 has not been implemented, and that efforts to reduce LEGAL
immigration levels in the current Congress were not successful.  </tt><p>
<tt>* There may be more of a "class" than a country-wide worry about
immigrants.  The perception is that unskilled immigrants are adding to the
poverty population in the US and, while they may arrive with a work ethic, and
not be eligible for welfare benefits, many are employed in high-turnover and
short-career industries, such as agriculture and meatpacking.  Thus, if the US
continues to accept large numbers of poorly educated immigrants, it seems
poised to reduce their access, as well as the access of US-born poor people, to
welfare benefits.  Just as US refugee policy was made in part by the budget
policy of reducing the period of federal reimbursement for benefits, so US
immigration policy may be set indirectly by budget policies.</tt><p>
<tt>* Some participants thought that the best way to deal with the migration
hump would be to have a guest worker policy for Mexicans, either with the quid
pro quo that Mexico help to manage emigration, or independent of Mexican
cooperation on border control.  It was emphasized that there would be
considerable opposition to such a policy in the US, and that it has proven very
difficult for the US to develop mechanisms to certify labor shortages, ensure
that US employers look seriously for US workers and abide by the terms of
worker contracts, and prevent temporary workers from becoming permanent
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>* There is plenty of blame for the current migration patterns.  For
example, the SAW program legalized about one in six adult men in rural Mexico,
and the program's designers asserted that SAWs would keep their families in
low-cost-of-living Mexico, and commute to seasonal US farm jobs.  However, the
US granted Mexicans immigration status, which allowed Mexicans to unify their
families in the US, so that when Mexico accelerated the transformation of its
rural sector in the early 1990s, many SAWs decided to unify their families in
the US.</tt><p>
