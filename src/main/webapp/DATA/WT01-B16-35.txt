<p>
The tasks related to the work scope in this SOW are identified by contract phase.  Where the
same or similar tasks occur in two or more contract phases, the tasks are described in terms of
their applicability to the specific contract phases.  The tasks, subtasks, and activities are
described in detail in the following sections, and the products of these tasks and activities are
identified therein (e.g., plans, schedules, reviews, reports, hardware items, services, and other
deliverables).   Within the scope of this SOW, the RSA shall furnish all labor, materials,
facilities, services, equipment, management, administration, and all else necessary to develop and
implement Purchaser Site Service Plans and a Regional Servicing Plan for the term of the
contract.  The SNF transportation and storage systems to be used by the RSA shall comply with
the requirements of 10 CFR 71 and 10 CFR 72 respectively, and be NRC certified or approved. 
The transportation and storage systems technical requirements and specifications are in <a href="#Acquisition of Hardware Items">Section 4.2.2.2.</a>
<p>
<h4>4.1  PHASE A:  DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICING PLANS  </h4>
<p>
The work scope for Phase A: Development of Servicing Plans includes the functions of
management, planning and requirements development, and preparation of revised prices for
Phase B and Phase C.
<p>
    <strong> 4.1.1     Management</strong>
<p>
     The RSA management system shall be documented in the Management Plan and
     Subcontract Plan  which are described in the following sections:
<p>
          <strong>4.1.1.1  Management Plan.</strong>  The RSA  shall provide a Management Plan for
          Phase  B and Phase C which shall be updated  as required.  The management
          reports and reviews provided for in the Plan will be used by OCRWM to monitor
          the RSA's progress and performance of work scope.
     <p>     
          <strong>4.1.1.2  Subcontract Plan.</strong>  The RSA shall provide a Subcontract Plan identifying
          all key subcontractors.  This plan is separate and distinct from the subcontracting
          plan required under the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
<p>
         <strong> 4.1.1.3  Quality Assurance.</strong>  Because it is envisioned that the RSA will not be
          performing any work subject to the controls of the QARD in Phase A, the only
          QA requirements for Phase A activities are performance of the work using best
          commercial practices. 
<p>     
   <strong>  4.1.2     Phase A:  Development of  Plans</strong>
   <p>       
    <dl>
<dt> The plans and information to be developed during Phase A include:
<dd>          Purchaser Site Service Plans
<dd>          Regional Service Plan
<dd>          Acquisition Plan
<dd>          Phase B and Phase C Revised Prices
<dd>          QA Program and Plan
<dd>          Institutional Outreach Program Plan
</dl>
<p>
       <strong> 4.1.2.1  Purchaser Site Service Plans.</strong>   The Phase A RSA shall work with those
        Purchasers in its region as identified in the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule
        for the Phase C operating period and prepare Purchaser Site Service Plans.  The
        Purchaser Site Service Plans will document the operating parameters at each
        Purchaser site that will govern the waste acceptance and on-site/near-site
        transportation operations.  The Purchaser Site Service Plans shall contain all
        planning information necessary  in sufficient detail to support preparation for and
        performance of the waste acceptance and transportation activities required to meet
        OCRWM's commitment under the Purchaser disposal contracts.  The RSA shall
        demonstrate  acceptance of the Site Service Plans by providing written Purchaser
        approval of the final Plans.   
<p>
        The Plans shall be provided to OCRWM for use in managing the Purchaser disposal
        contracts.
<p>
       <strong> 4.1.2.2  Regional Servicing Plan.</strong>  During Phase A, the RSA shall prepare a
        Regional Servicing Plan consistent with OCRWM guidance and the Purchaser Site
        Service Plans for the Purchasers in its region.  The Regional Servicing Plan shall
        contain time-phased, integrated schedules identifying each campaign for each
        Purchaser in the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule for each year of the planned
        five years of operation in Phase C.  The plan shall identify all time-phased
        requirements for transportation and storage related hardware items, structures,
        systems and components, to include canisters and storage modules, and all
        transportation and intermodal services.  Based on the time-phased requirements, the
        RSA shall develop the regional operating fleet requirements by year, e.g., how many
        dual-purpose systems, transport-only casks, SNF canisters, storage modules, etc, by
        type and other systems or components that will be needed to support each year of
        operation. <p>
        The Regional Servicing Plan shall contain a section that describes the RSA's plans
        for acquiring all of the resources and assembling the organizational capabilities
        required for performance of the Phase B and Phase C work scope.  This section of
        the Plan shall describe all of the responsible organizations and their assigned work
        scope, logistical approach to establishing the operating organization, staffing,
        communications, training, development of operating procedures, acquisition of
        transportation and cask maintenance services, etc.  Additionally, the plan will
        explain how the resources will be integrated and assembled and how the operations
        will be started up.
<p>
       <strong> 4.1.2.3  Regional Servicing Agent's  Acquisition Plan.</strong>  Using the hardware items,
        structures and other systems and components and services requirements developed
        in the Regional Servicing Plan, the RSA shall prepare an Acquisition Plan that
        reflects planned acquisitions for each year of Phase B and Phase C activities.  The
        Acquisition Plan shall identify all significant contracting initiatives planned for
        acquisition of hardware items, software, and services to meet the Regional
        Servicing Plan requirements.  The plan shall incorporate a master schedule
        reflecting the timing of all significant acquisitions to include key milestones for
        specific acquisition, and planned interactions with the NRC.
<p>
      <strong>  4.1.2.4  Quality Assurance Program and Plan.</strong>  During Phase A, the RSA shall
        ensure that its QA program for Phase B includes and reflects all of the QA
        requirements for those systems, structures and/or components and services being
        procured and used by the RSA and related activities subject to the requirements of
        10 CFR Part 71 and 10 CFR Part 72 in accordance with the QARD.  Controlled
        copies of the RSA's NRC approved updated QA Program and evidence of NRC
        approval shall be provided to OCRWM.  The application of the RSA's QA Program
        to Phase B and Phase C work scope shall be documented in a QA Plan, which must
        be approved by OCRWM prior to commencement of Phase B work activities
        subject to the controls of the QARD.  The RSA's QA Program and QA Plan shall
        be submitted to OCRWM not later than nine months after commencement of Phase
        A.
<p>
        <strong>4.1.2.5  Institutional Outreach Program and Plan.</strong>  In order to successfully
        perform the function of transporting SNF to the Federal Facility, the RSA will have
        to interact with the public and provide information to interested local, State, and
        Tribal groups.  The RSA shall establish an Institutional Outreach Program for
        public interaction and dissemination of information to individuals and groups
        interested in RSA activities.  The program shall provide for preparation and
        dissemination of information regarding the RSA shipping activities and
        transportation equipment to interested public groups and for RSA participation in 
        public meetings.  RSA institutional outreach activities shall be coordinated with the
        other RSAs, as required, for consistency and to avoid dissemination of conflicting
        or confusing information.  The RSA shall prepare a plan for implementation of its
        Institutional Outreach Program and submit it to OCRWM not later than nine months
        after start of Phase A activities.  All of the content of public information regarding
        RSA activities shall be cleared with OCRWM prior to release.
<p>
        <strong>4.1.2.6  Phase B/Phase C Price Information.</strong>  During Phase A, the RSA shall
        prepare prices for the Phase B and Phase C work activities and a revised price for
        canisters, storage modules and the hardware needed for support of Federal Facility
        Operator activities, in accordance with proposal format and instructions provided in
        Part IV, Section L of the contract:
<p>
<h4>4.2     PHASE B: ACQUISITION OF HARDWARE ITEMS AND MOBILIZATION</h4>
<p>
The initial focus of the work scope for Phase B is pre-operational startup preparations, including
performance of the work and activities defined in the RSA's Management and Acquisition Plan 
developed in Phase A.  Upon commencement of Phase C waste acceptance and transportation
operations, the Management Plan shall be revised to include provisions for managing the
continuing Phase B work scope and provisions for managing the Phase C work scope defined in
the Regional Servicing Plan and the Acquisition Plan
<p>
  <strong> 4.2.1      Management</strong>
<p>
   The management system shall be documented in updated Phase B Management and
   Subcontract Plans.  There are changes in QA requirements for Phase B which must be
   reflected and documented in the RSA's QA Program and QA Plan which are described in
   the following sections:
<p>
       <strong> 4.2.1.1  Quality Assurance Program and Plan.</strong>  Throughout Phase B, the RSA
        shall maintain its QA Program and QA Plan and ensure compliance with the
        requirements of 10 CFR Part 71 and 10 CFR Part 72 in accordance with the QARD. 
        This includes revision of the Program and Plan to meet QA requirements emerging
        from changes in the RSA's activities and its Subcontract Plan and Regional
        Servicing Plan.  Prior approval by OCRWM of the RSA's and its subcontractors'
        QA programs and plans is only required initially.  Thereafter, the RSA and its
        subcontractors performing work subject to the provisions of the QARD are expected
        to maintain their QA documents as required by the regulations and the QARD and
        the referenced subcontracts.  These changes will be reviewed by OCRWM for
        approval after implementation by the RSA.  <p>

        <strong>4.2.1.2  Subcontractor Quality Assurance Programs and Plans.</strong>  The RSA's
        subcontractors shall have QA programs and plans that are applicable to their scopes
        of work for Phase B and Phase C.  At the RSA's option, subcontractors may work
        under the RSA's NRC approved QA program.  The RSA's subcontract acquisition
        documents shall specify the applicable OCRWM QARD criteria for each major
        subcontractor work scope.  The RSA shall  provide OCRWM with evidence that  all
        of its subcontractors' QA programs and plans meet those applicable criteria.  For
        those subcontractors performing work subject to the controls of the QARD, copies
        of NRC approval of their QA programs shall be provided to OCRWM.  The
        subcontractors' plans shall identify procedures and instructions that will assure
        compliance with QA requirements for the assigned work scope. 
<p>
   <strong>4.2.2      Phase B Regional Servicing System Startup Activities</strong>
<p>
   The RSA shall perform all planning, development, integration and acquisition work
   necessary to establish a regional servicing capability for its  region.  The major Phase B
   work activities include but are not limited to the following: 
<p>
        <strong><a name="purchaser site">4.2.2.1  Maintenance of Purchaser Site Service Plans and Regional Servicing
        Plan.  </strong></a>
<p><dl>
 <dd>       a.    <em>On-going Plans Maintenance Activities.</em>  Throughout the Phase B period of
              performance, the RSA shall maintain communications with the Purchasers
              in its region and evaluate emerging changes related to Purchaser operations
              and on-site and near-site changes to facilities and transportation
              infrastructure, and changes to the Federal Facility receiving capability and
              scheduled operations.  The purpose of this activity is to identify where
              changes are required to Purchaser Site Service Plans.  All changes to the 
              Purchaser Site Service Plans shall be evaluated to determine when a change
              to the Regional Servicing Plan will be required.  The RSA shall prepare the
              required changes and update, with Purchaser approval, the Purchaser Site
              Service Plans and Regional Servicing Plan as required and provide copies
              to OCRWM.    
<p>
 <dd>       b.    <em>Schedule and Operations Reviews.</em>  To facilitate the effective, orderly, and
              coordinated operation of the overall waste acceptance, transportation, and
              delivery activities of all the RSAs and to facilitate the receiving and
              processing activities of the Federal Facility Operator, the RSA shall
              participate in quarterly Schedule and Operations Reviews to be hosted by
              the Federal Facility Operator.  The principal attendees shall include
              representatives from each RSA, the Federal Facility Operator, the DOE,
              and other Federal government agencies, e.g., possibly the NRC,
              Department of Transportation, etc.  
<p>
<dd>      c. <em>    Emergent Changes to the Regional Servicing Plans.</em>   It is recognized that
              there are circumstances that necessitate changes to the  Regional Servicing
              Plan.  When such a circumstance arises, the RSA is responsible for
              developing interim changes to the Regional Servicing Plan, obtaining
              coordination and concurrence with the affected Purchasers and the Federal
              Facility Operator.  The intent is that RSA shall fulfill delivery requirements
              of the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule to the Federal Facility with as
              few changes as possible to the Regional Servicing Plan.
</dl><p>
             <strong>4.2.2.2  <a name="Acquisition of Hardware Items">Acquisition of Hardware Items.</a></strong>  Acquisition of required hardware items,
              structures and other systems and components is a significant work activity
              commencing early in Phase B.  The RSA's Acquisition Plan shall identify all
              acquisitions for the services, facilities, hardware items the RSA elects to acquire
              and those items OCRWM plans to receive from the RSA <a href="2scope.htm">(Section 2.3)</a>.  The
              following minimum design and material requirements and criteria apply to the
              casks, casks/canisters and transportable storage casks (TSC) and supporting
              ancillary equipment to be acquired by the RSA for the Federal Facility. 
<p>
<dl><dd>        a.    <em>General Performance Criteria. </em>

 <p>
</dl>  <dd>     b.   <em> Disposal Considerations.</em>  Design and material considerations for disposal
              are optional.  These requirements will be developed during the NRC
              repository licensing process.  The Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC)
              Subsystem Design Procurement Specification, DBG000000-01717-6300-00001 contains those design and material requirements currently
              anticipated for disposal.  If the RSA desires to attempt to meet any disposal
              requirements, this specification may be used as guidance.
<p>
              [Note: OCRWM is considering policy options that may allow for
              compensation to the Purchasers or the RSA for the avoided costs of
              canisters that prove to be disposable.  The timing of such compensation
              may be tied to the utilization of such canisters in waste disposal packages.]
