NEW YORK CITY PLANS TO SECURITIZE TAX LIENS

The nascent movement among municipalities to securitize delinquent
property taxes took a major step forward last week when New York City
stepped into the fray, requesting proposals from investment banks on how
best to securitize $200 million to $250 million of tax liens; it would be
the biggest such securitization ever.
        The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrears
totaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; and
it is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the senior
notes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.
        Although the document states that an objective is to complete the
transaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "pretty
tight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completion
of any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment of
pending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is the
city's advisor.
        A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pending
legislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city as
the lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes when
someone falls behind on his property taxes.
        The proposed issue will be backed by the higher quality tax liens,
mostly commercial real estate with a high likelihood of repayment.
        According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizations
will accomplish four things: to increase the cash flow from delinquent tax
liens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;
increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need for
the city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.
        "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficient
method to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure process
the City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restore
fairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improve
collection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieve
upward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term sale
program will be the initial securitization," the request for proposals
states.
Choosing Bankers
        The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike a
traditional private placement, it will be fully underwritten by the
investment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-
efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital will
be funneled into the city's operations fund.
The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was last Friday,
and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about two weeks.
        The document asks bankers to describe their experience implementing
new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list of those with
specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.
        Most recently, Smith Barney priced a $19 million issue for the City
of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. Chemical Securities worked on New York
City's securitization of cash flows from delinquent tax liens a couple of
years ago and CS First Boston has structured deals for Jersey City.

LATIN AMERICAN ABS SEEN STABILIZING AFTER SURGE IN '95

Securitization of future cash flows in Latin America hit an all-
time high last year of  almost $3 billion. Although securitization of
future receivables may post a moderate gain in 1996, the market is unlikely
to see the same level of expansion, industry sources said last week.
        Duff & Phelps estimates that around $2.8 billion in new future flow
transactions were issued last year, up from around $1.5 billion the
previous year.
        "1995 was an extraordinary year," said Michael Moran, assistant
vice president. "It won't be that good this year, but we're projecting
moderate growth," he added. New issuers will learn about securitization
thanks to high profile deals from companies like YPF, Moran said. And
investment bankers searching for new business in Latin America will
cultivate securitized transactions, resulting in slightly greater volume
this year.
        Investment bankers note, however, that securitized volume is always
dependent on the Eurobond market. If Latin American issuers have access to
that market, many find it more economical.
        Following the Mexican peso crisis at the end of 1994, Latin
American issuers were essentially shut out of the Euromarket and
securitized volume grew dramatically as a result in 1995.
        This year, the door to the Euromarket may open a crack, noted one
banker active in securitization. Indeed, Mexico already tapped that sector
with a DM 1 billion bond two weeks ago which was reportedly well-received.
        "As conditions improve in the Eurobond market, future receivable
securitization will inevitably decline," the banker said. But Mexico is
still perceived as risky overall, with BB ratings from Duff & Phelps and
Standard & Poor's. "Mexican issuers will still use securitization," he
predicted.
        Ultimately, as countries in Latin America reach investment grade,
they will switch altogether to Eurobonds from future cash flow deals. At
that time, these countries will probably be ready to develop their own
domestic asset-backed markets.
        However, "this could be a ten-year process," one banker said, and
there may be several more cycles for future flow securitizations in the
coming years as a result.

INVESTORS BULLISH ON ABS PROSPECTS IN '96

Despite the general tightening of spreads in 1995, fixed-income
investors are inclined to increase their allocations to asset-backed
securities in the year ahead, according to preliminary results from a
survey conducted by Asset Sales Report and MBIA Insurance Corp.  Final
tallies will be presented next week at the American Banker/Asset Sales
Report 11th Annual Asset Securitization Conference in Naples, Fla.
        Of the 13 institutional investors responding, 11 said they are
ready to put still more money into ABS even though 10 of the 13 believe
that spreads will at best remain near current levels and could widen out in
1996. Only one institution expected to cut its allocation to ABS and one
said that it was unsure at this point whether it would increase or decrease
its commitment to the area.
        Despite near unanimity about their commitment to ABS, investors
were clearly more ambivalent about the prospects for interest rates and the
economy. Of the 13 respondents, seven predicted higher long-term Treasury
rates and six projected a drop.
        An averaged forecast from the group would put the long Treasury
rate at about 6.18% at year-end 1996, or almost exactly where it was at
last Wednesday's close. At the time the first surveys were distributed in
late November, the long Treasury yield was at 6.30%.
        Similarly,  seven expected that GDP will rise in 1996 while six
foresaw a decline. An averaged growth forecast from the 13  put GDP at a
gain of just under 1% in 1996. There were no projections at either the high
growth (above 4%) or sharp decline (-4%) ends of the spectrum.
        Among the new asset classes that investors showed some interest in
were home improvement loans and subprime auto loan-backed securities. In
each case, more investors indicated that they would buy the securities in
1996 than actually did participate in 1995.
        Other areas mentioned were securities backed by 12b-1 fees
generated by mutual funds and franchise-backed securities. Asset classes
that elicited caution from the investor group included timeshares, future
receivables, subprime auto loans (appearing on both lists) and Latin
American securitizations. In each case, more than three investors said that
they would not consider participating in these kinds of deals.
        Although not listed as a choice in the survey, three investors
wrote in to say they would not consider healthcare receivable-backed issues
in the year ahead, possibly owing to the well-publicized fraud in Towers'
deals two years ago as well as the complexity of the asset itself.
        Overall, however, investors expect to see even more asset-backed
supply in the year ahead. All 13 respondents said they expect at least $100
billion in new issuance this year, while 10 said that volume should exceed
$110 billion. Two even projected that issuance would top the $130 billion
mark. Interestingly, the investors as a group were more bullish on this
year's issuance level than investment bankers.
        Final details on investors' and others' forecasts for 1996 market
will appear in next week's issue of ASR.

FIRST CREDIT CARD ISSUES ENJOY SMOOTH RECEPTION

Three credit card issuers broke the ice in 1996, issuing around
$2.5 billion in new securities last week. All of the deals benefited from
pent-up investor demand including the first zero coupon asset-backed bond
from Citibank.
        Advanta's $466 million deal was fully sold just after pricing,
reportedly purchased with new cash, while Discover's transaction was
upsized by 100% to $1 billion.
        In each case, the deals were structured to appeal to more than one
sector of the asset-backed market or to bring in new investors entirely.
        Citibank's novel transaction was priced late Thursday through lead
manager Goldman Sachs at 37 bps over Treasury strip of February 2001 and
was quoted at around 37-38 bps over the five-year Treasury bond--on top of
five-year credit card securities. Priced at a discount of 74.817237, the
bonds yield 5.861%.
        The offering attracted around a dozen new investors to the asset-
backed market, mainly zero coupon buyers, traders said. "The interesting
thing is that this is probably the most liquid zero coupon paper in that
market," one syndicate official noted. The 6% subordinate tranche, also a
zero, was priced 15 bps behind the senior securities by lead manager
Merrill Lynch. (Full structure and pricing details will follow next week.)
        On Wednesday, Discover basked in the limelight with a five-year
floater; the issuer tapped into two investor bases, according to an
official at lead manager Dean Witter. Five-years is short enough for U.S.
buyers and although European buyers tend to buy longer-term securities, the
Discover bonds appealed to this sector as well, he noted.
        "We put in a $500 million deal and went to $1 billion without
giving up anything on the pricing," the official said. It was priced at par
with a coupon of 17 basis points over Libor, and once freed to trade, was
bid there.
        At the same time, Salomon Brothers sold two seven-year senior
classes for Advanta, one fixed and one floating-rate, using a structure
almost identical to the issuer's five-year Series 1995-F in November,
except for the maturity and the higher credit enhancement level.
        The combined fixed and floating-rate structure "allows us to tap
into two different investor bases," explained Mike Coco, director of credit
card securitization at Advanta. Issuing a fixed-rate bond was especially
attractive with interest rates so low, he added.
        The enhancement level was 100 bps higher than Series 1995-F because
of the longer maturity. Standard & Poor's "raises the enhancement level for
credit card securities with terms longer than five years," explained Ray
Galkowski, head of the credit card ratings group at S&P. Although he did
not comment on the Advanta deal specifically, Galkowski said the rating
agency holds that there is an increase in risk the longer the maturity, and
that the five-year term marks a natural dividing point.
        The additional support was all within the collateral interest which
was rated BBB by Fitch Investors Service. Because Fitch did not require
more enhancement for the longer maturity on the deal, it assigned a higher
rating of A+ to the subordinate tranche, according to analyst Mike Dean.
        Coco anticipated that Advanta's volume for 1996 would be close to
last year's level of $3 billion.

FASIT CAUGHT IN BUDGET QUAGMIRE

As the U.S. budget talks continue, the fate of the Financial Asset
Securitization Investment Trust (FASIT) is hanging in the balance. While
proponents are optimistic, inclusion of the FASIT in the final legislation
is not ensured.
        "We're caught in the political crossfire," said Donald B. Susswein,
partner at Thacher, Profitt & Wood, who worked on the proposal. The FASIT
would extend many of the benefits of the REMIC to non-mortgage assets and
was first proposed as legislation two years ago.
        Dampening its chances for passage with the budget package, the
FASIT proposal was placed on the Clinton administration's list of
"objectionable special interest" provisions in the Budget late last month.
However, nine Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee
responded quickly with a letter to White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta,
arguing the merits of the FASIT proposal.
        "In testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, Treasury
stated that it did not oppose the FASIT legislation," the letter states.
"Treasury and the Administration have also consistently supported asset
securitization, included in the context of the Community Development Bank
bill." In addition, it concludes, "FASIT is also a revenue raiser."

COMMENTS TO FASB FOCUS ON REPOS

As the deadline to comment on FASB's exposure draft on
securitization draws near, the Board has received about 25 comments, mostly
pertaining to repurchase agreements and requesting to testify at a public
hearing in February.
        Comments on the proposal, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," are due January 22.
        According to the commments received, the new rule would
dramatically limit banks' use of repurchase agreements, a major source of
funding, especially in light of the Board's recent tightening of financial
accounting standard 115.
        The exposure draft was issued around the same time that FASB
provided banks a window to transfer securities currently classified as held
to maturity into the available-for-sale category without a penalty. The
window of opportunity in FAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities," closed at the end of 1995, after which such
transfers are prohibited.
        As a result, a number of banking institutions put longer-term repos
into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealized gains and losses
needn't be marked to market. However, the proposed statement would require
any repos with a maturity of three months or more to recorded as a sale,
and hence marked to market. Banks would thereby be limited to using repos
with maturities of less than three months to avoid increasing volatility in
their capital bases, and any longer transactions existing when the rule
comes into effect would suddenly have to appear in the income statement.
FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit on repos is a period
that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because the Board believed that
the vast majority of repo transactions held far shorter maturities. "We've
since learned that there are more transactions with durations around three
months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, the project manager at FASB.
The Board will likely reconsider the three-month limit as it continues its
deliberations.

CITIBANK'S MASTER TRUST RENAMED

Citibank changed the name of its master trust last week to Citibank
Credit Card Master Trust I as part of an effort at the bank to increase
name recognition
        Since 1991, the trust was known as Standard Credit Card Master
Trust I. All deals issued from the trust will now carry the name Citibank,
including its first deal of the year, a $1 billion zero coupon bond last
week.
        With an estimated $44 billion in credit card receivables, Citibank
is the largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in the world.

FLOATING-RATE SECURITIES WELL-BID AS NEW ISSUANCE BEGINS

After a two-day hiatus due to snowstorms on the East Coast, new
issuance got off to a strong start last week and players were bracing for a
blizzard of another sort: another year of credit card issuance.
         Despite expectations for increased supply, spreads in the
secondary market held ground, with floating-rate securities enjoying
renewed demand.
        "Once the trigger is pulled on the first deal, others will follow
quickly," said one rating agency analyst. Indeed, three credit card deals
were priced last week in quick succession: Discover, Advanta, and Citibank.
        Despite the addition of $1 billion in new five-year floaters from
Discover, floaters remained well-bid. The deal was priced "aggressively" at
17 basis points over Libor and held at that level once it was free to trade
last week, one investment banker noted.
        In general, floaters looked inexpensive compared with fixed-rate
bonds on a swap basis, and as a result, dealers and investors were taking
advantage of the opportunity last week, traders said.
        Fixed-rate securities suffered neglect as a result of that
opportunity. In addition, one trader said that "investors are apathetic to
Treasuries right now and the market in general is backing off."
        The five-year, fixed-rate sector, which suffered from oversupply in
the fourth quarter and widened a few basis points as a result, was holding
at around 37 bps to 38 bps over Treasuries.
        Advanta's seven-year fixed-rate deal, totaling $220 million, was
priced at 46 bps over Treasury, but was softer when freed to trade, sources
said. With interest rates so low, investors were apparently not overly
enthused with longer-term, fixed-rate securities; the floating-rate portion
of the Advanta deal went very well, traders agreed.
        Home equity loan securities, which had also widened significantly
during the fourth quarter, tightened at the end of the year and have held,
said one trader. Three-year pass-through securities were quoted at between
105 bps and 115 bps over Treasury depending on the specific issuer. Three-
year tranched paper was quoted at around 85-90 bps.

CREDIT CARD ABS WEAKER: MOODY'S

Delinquencies on securitized credit card portfolios rose in October
to 4.23% from 4.17% in September. Overall, "performance continued to
decline," said Moody's analyst Ed Bankole, who prepared the credit card
index (see page 5).
        Charge-offs were slightly lower in October but still represent the
highest levels of the year with the exception of September. Thanks to
higher portfolio yield of 18.07%, excess spread moved up to 5.42% from
4.80%.

CHARMING ABS STEADIER IF UNCERTAIN

Although the retailer faced fears of impending bankruptcy just
months ago, Charming Shoppes securities could rebound significantly, with
Salomon Brothers analyst Paul Jablansky now categorizing the issues as
"likely to generate among the best returns in the three-year sector of the
credit card ABS market."
        The Bensalem, Penn. based outfit reached a definitive agreement
last month with Congress Financial Corp.  whereby  Congress will provide
Charming with a $157 million asset-based working capital facility for a
term of 2.5 years.
        Under this arrangement, Charming has successfully restructured $83
million of bank debt with existing lenders and substantially extended the
typical 90-day letter of credit.
        Recently estimated with a spread over 80bp for a 3-year term,
Jablansky says the ABS is now "priced at a level that still heavily weights
the likelihood of a bankruptcy--and a subsequent early amortization event--
during the next 18 months."
        Other analysts are not so sure. "It may be compelling, but I'd have
to see a lot of evidence to be convinced," said one source.
        "At this point I'd say it continues to be an outlier, pretty hairy
and likely to underperform."
        In the first nine months of 1995, Charming experienced a comparable
sales decline of 22% in its nationwide chain of Fashion Bug and Fashion Bug
Plus women's clothing stores as rumors of its fiscal troubles drove spreads
40-50 bp wide on its single public credit card securitization.
        With the new financing agreement, the retailer is "virtually
assured" of remaining solvent through the offering's maturity, optimistic
sources said.
        Jablansky adds: "The likelihood (of insolvency) is arguably no
greater than that of other retailers, whose credit card ABS trade at
significantly tighter spreads...the actual probabilities of any of these
early amortization scenarios are well below our arbitrary assumption of
50%."
        Any potential divergence from this forecast, Jablansky argues,
would stem from the fact that "the holiday season was not good for
retailers overall.
        The performance of the retail sector as it influences the bond
market is something Charming Shoppes will have to face as would any other
retailer."

NOMURA'S TRAIN DEAL CLOSELY WATCHED AS EURO PIPELINE BUILDS

Overseas securitization engines were sputtering back to life last week
after the traditional new year's lull.  While the flow of deals is expected
to be thin this early in the new quarter and year, a number of deals are
heard to be in the pipeline for later months.
        The deal garnering the most interest from securitization desks has
been Nomura's zero coupon train lease deal. Expected to receive triple-A
ratings from Duff & Phelps, the deal totals about $726 million (ASR
12/4/96). The transaction is expected to price this week, but participants
were reluctant to discuss details since it carries a private Rule 144a
tranche for sale in the United States.
        The structure of the deal creates securities from a series of small
government payments of about $9 million each over 98 months. Those
payments, essentially a series of bullets, are to be bought by investors
who will then typically find their own swap counterparties to gain floating
funding. Securitization experts expressed concern that the deal's failure
to include an internal swap counterparty would lead to illiquidity.
        Syndicate desks will be eyeing the 144a structure of the deal in
the coming months with a view toward the larger potential rail lease
markets in Britain and elsewhere.
Goldman Loses Three ABS Pros
        The struggle for mandates this early in the season has led to some
key horseraces between premier U.K. desks. The Bank of Kuwait was set to
award its mandate late last week for a second deal. The first from Kuwait
occurred last year, as Goldman Sachs led a deal which was relatively well
received. This time around, Goldman appears to have had some competitors.
Chief among them was Lehman Brothers, whose proposal appeared to be in the
running.
        The chief reasons for Goldman's failure to win the mandate outright
appeared to be its slew of departures in recent weeks, capped by this
week's news that the head of securitization John Van Deventer had left. Van
Deventer's destination is not known, though it appears he will not be
joining another big firm. Van Deventer's departure, coupled with those of
two junior analysts last week, added to the perception that Goldman's
resources have been depleted. Executive director Roger Barris will assume
Van Deventer's responsibilities.
        The UBK deal itself will be sized at about $100 million pounds
sterling. It will be a floater, with collateral similar to the last deal.
The deal will securitize over 35 commercial mortgages on investment
properties.
Scandinavia Active
        Elsewhere, Lehman has won the mandate for another securitization
from Sweden.  A consortium representing a large group of Swedish municipal
housing firms has been working with Lehman to establish a conduit-like
structure for future deals. Lehman's Jim Clark, who heads up the asset
securitization group, was in Sweden last week to discuss the plans. A deal
for a municipal housing firm outside Stockholm is slated for this summer.
        A second St. Eric transaction is also heard to be on the horizon.
This time around, only one of the three housing firms which participated in
the first transaction will be involved.  Collateral for the deal will be
