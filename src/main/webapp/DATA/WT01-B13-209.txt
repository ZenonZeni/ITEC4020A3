you about mutual fund performance?">
<BR>

The ultimate measure of your mutual fund is
whether it enables you to
achieve your investment goal - the purchase of a
home, the financing of
your child's education or the attainment of a
comfortable retirement.
But how do you evaluate your mutual fund's
periodic progress? What
encourages you about your fund's performance and
what discourages you?
Which of the many performance measures are
meaningful and which do you
dismiss as investment world static?
<BR><BR>

These are the questions that we sought to answer
when we recently asked
several hundred thousand Kemper mutual fund
shareholders in four equity
and three income funds to complete a Kemper Pulse
survey mailed along
with their issues of <I>Kemper Reports.</I> Response to
the survey was high,
and the results are believed to be statistically
significant and
demographically sound. Highlights of the survey
findings follow.
<BR><BR>

"On their own, survey results can't and shouldn't
dictate investment
philosophy," says Stephen B. Timbers, president
of Kemper Funds.
"But they can improve our understanding of
shareholders' expectations of
their funds, and they can help frame our
communications to investors."

<!-- question 1 -->

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf_question1.gif" ALT="1">
The performance of a mutual fund can be measured
a
variety of ways. What's most important to you
about your fund?

Total return is widely considered to be the best
yardstick of mutual
fund performance because it takes into account
the three components of
performance: income dividends, capital gain
dividends and changes in
the value of the fund's shares. 
<BR><BR>

<!-- question 2 -->

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf_question2.gif" ALT="2"

Question #2 on the survey varied, depending on
whether it was mailed
to an income or equity fund shareholder. 
<BR><BR>

<B>Equity Funds</B>
- Individual investors have varying expectations of
their mutual funds. For example, how many years
are you prepared to give your equity fund to
appreciate in value?
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf3_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR><BR>

<B>Income Funds</B>
- Individual investors have varying expectations of
their mutual funds. For example, to what extent
do you rely on your fund's dividends for your
monthly income?
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf4_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR><BR>

Investors in equities are wise to give their
investment more than
five years to appreciate. The fortunes of every
company depend to
some extent upon the health of the U.S. economy.
Giving an equity
investment just one or two years to perform may
be insufficient time to
expose it to the most productive points in an
economic cycle. 
<BR><BR>

An income fund's ability to provide current
income is one of its primary
appeals. However, a mutual fund's earnings are
influenced by interest
rates and other variables that can fluctuate
significantly.
