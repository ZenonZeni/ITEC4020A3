Zellman Warhaft</H3>
Two members of the School received the Dean's Award for Teaching Excellence
this year. <B>Don Bartel</B> received the award for development of the course
M&amp;AE 465 - Introduction to Biomechanical Engineering and for his extensive
involvement in supervising undergraduate research, as well as projects in
the Master of Engineering Program. <B>Zellman Warhaft</B>, professor in
the Sibley School, has taught M&amp;AE 117 - Introduction to Mechanical
Engineering, M&amp;AE 323 - Introductory Fluid Mechanics, and M&amp;AE 400
- Components and Systems: Engineering in a Social Context (co-listed as
Science and Technology Studies 400). Through these courses and related efforts,
Professor Warhaft has succeeded in emphasizing to students environmental
concerns and social responsibility as criteria in engineering design.
