<P>Dr. Elaine Gordon, Ph.D. is a Clinical Psychologist with a specialty
in infertility, child development, reproductive medicine and third party
family-building. Besides her role as a therapist and group facilitator working
with patients struggling with fertility related issues, she lectures on various
topics surrounding the psychology of reproductive medicine. Dr. Gordon is
the author of <A HREF="NewsF95.html#Mommy">Mommy, Did I Grow in Your Tummy?
Where Some Babies Come From</A>, a children's book dedicated to explaining
a child's unique reproductive beginnings.
<P>Her professional associations include The American Psychological Association,
The American Fertility Society, and the Pacific Coast Fertility Society.
She is currently serving as Education Chair for the Psychological Special
Interest Group of the American Fertility Society. Dr. Gordon's clinical work
include therapy and group for couples and individuals, staff training for
programs involved in reproductive medicine, and third party screening and
evaluation matching donors and recipients for egg donation and/or surrogacy.
She counsels birthmothers and prospective parents who are considering adoption.
<P>Dr. Gordon is well versed in both the medical and psychological aspects
of reproductive medicine utilizing third parties. Her involvement in egg
donation and surrogacy programs has stimulated an interest in the issues
surrounding secrecy and disclosure in third party parenting. Related to the
disclosure/nondisclosure issue is the need to assess the advantages and
disadvantages of open versus closed donation policies. Dr. Gordon is currently
involved in several research projects investigating the psychological implication
of using egg and/or sperm donation as a means of building families.
