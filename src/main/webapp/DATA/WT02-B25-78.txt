<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Dissociative Disorders: What Are They?</b></font></h4>
<p>Dissociative Disorders are so-called because they are marked by a dissociation from or 
interruption of a person's fundamental aspects of waking consciousness (such as who he is, 
what his personal history is, etc.) Dissociative Disorders come in many forms, the most 
famous of which is dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality 
disorder.) All of the dissociative disorders are thought to stem from trauma experienced by 
the individual with this disorder. The dissociative aspect is thought to be a coping 
mechanism--the person literally dissociates himself from a situation or experience too 
traumatic to integrate with his conscious self. Symptoms of disorders, if not one or more of 
the disorders themselves, are seen in a number of other mental illnesses, including 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. </p>
<p><b><i>Dissociative amnesia</i></b>: This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of critical personal 
information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. Dissociative amnesia, unlike other 
types of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma (like a blow to the head). 
Dissociative amnesia has several subtypes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Localized amnesia</i> is present in a individual who has no memory of specific 
events that took place, usually traumatic. The loss of memory is localized within 
a specific window of time. For example, a survivor of a car wreck who has no 
memory of the experience until two days later is experiencing localized 
amnesia. </p>
<p><i>Selective amnesia</i> happens when a person can recall only small parts of events 
that took place in a defined period of time. For example, and abuse victim may 
recall only some parts of the series of events around his or her abuse. </p>
<p><i>Generalized</i> amnesia is diagnosed when a person's amnesia encompasses this 
entire life. </p>
<p><i>Continuous amnesia</i> occurs when the individual has no memory for events 
beginning from a certain point in the past continuing up to the present. </p>
<p><i>Systematized amnesia</i> is characterized by a loss of memory for a specific 
category of information. A person with this disorder might, for example, be 
missing all memories about one specific family member. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Dissociative fugue</i></b> is a rare disorder. An individual with dissociative fugue suddenly and 
unexpectedly takes physical leave of his surroundings and sets off on a journey of some 
kind. These journeys can last hours, or even several days or months. Individuals 
experiencing a dissociative fugue have traveled over thousands of miles. An individual in a 
fugue state is unaware of or confused about his identity, and in some cases will assume a 
new identity (although this is the exception). </p>
<p><b><i>Dissociative identity disorder</i></b>, which has been known as multiple personality disorder, is 
the most famous of the dissociative disorders. An individual suffering from DID has more 
than one distinct identity or personality state &quot;surfaces in the individual on a recurring basis. 
This disorder is also marked by memory gaps that vary with the individual's &quot;alters&quot; or 
other personalities. For more complete information on this disorder, write or call NAMI for 
the factsheet on multiple personality disorder. </p>
<p><b><i>Depersonalization disorder</i></b> is marked by a feeling of detachment or distance from one's 
own experience, body, or self. These feelings of depersonalization are recurrent. Of the 
dissociative disorders, depersonalization is one most easily identified with by the general 
public; one can easily relate to feeling as though they are in a dream, or being &quot;spaced out.&quot; 
Feeling out of control of one's actions and movements is something that people describe 
when intoxicated. An individual with depersonalization disorder has this experience so 
frequently and so severely that it interrupts his or her functioning and experience. A person's 
experience with depersonalization can be so severe that h or she believes the external world 
is unreal or distorted. </p>
<p><b>Treatment:</b> </p>
<p>Since dissociative disorders seem to be triggered as a response to trauma or abuse, 
treatment for individuals with such a disorder may stress psychotherapy, although a 
combination of psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments are often used. Many of 
the symptoms of dissociative disorders occur with other disorders, such as anxiety and 
depression, and can be controlled by the same drugs used to treat those disorders. A person 
in treatment for a dissociative disorder might benefit from antidepressants or antianxiety 
medication. </p>
