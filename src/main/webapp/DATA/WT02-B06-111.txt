<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy Part III: State of Current Law</title>

<h2>Part III. Prosecution of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Other 
Violations of Criminal Law in Interactive Media Proceeding Under Current Law</h2>
<p>
As the Internet and other interactive media become more fully 
integrated into the fabric of our society it is sad, but not surprising, that 
criminal behavior has begun to appear online.  Already cases of consumer 
fraud and theft of intellectual property have been reported and prosecuted.  
Traffickers in obscenity and child pornography, too, have begun to use the 
Internet to facilitate their criminal behavior.  Notwithstanding the recent 
appearance of crime online, cyberspace is not left in a state of anarchy.  Federal 
criminal laws against transportation of obscenity, child pornography, and 
harassment have all been used successfully to prosecute criminal behavior 
online.
<P>
More vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws may be necessary, 
but law enforcement agencies and some prominent pro-family groups agree 
current laws already enable prosecutions of online obscenity violations.  The 
Justice Department has repeatedly stated that there are no gaps in current 
federal criminal laws prohibiting the distribution by computer of obscenity 
and child pornography.  Following this logic, it is unnecessary to amend 
federal law to prohibit distribution of obscenity by computer, since existing 
law already criminalizes such conduct, as well as threats made by computer.
<p>
<h2>A.	There is no anarchy in cyberspace:  Federal and state criminal 
laws already are used to prosecute criminal conduct in interactive media</h2>
<P>
Tough obscenity, child pornography and harassment laws are already 
in the federal criminal code.  Under existing Federal law trafficking in 
<b>obscenity</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.1462, 1464, 1466), <b>child pornography</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.2252), <b>harassment</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.875(c)), <b>illegal solicitation or luring of minors </b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.2423(b)), and <b>threatening to injure someone</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.875(c)) have already been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer networks.  Notwithstanding all of the concern in the popular media and the United States Senate about this issue, all indications are that these and other laws fully cover all serious criminal behavior that may be perpetrated in cyberspace.
<p>
The Department of Justice and the American Family Association agree 
that existing laws already criminalize obscenity online.  The American Family 
Association, a prominent pro-family, anti-pornography group lead by a 
former federal prosecutor from the Reagan and Bush administrations wrote 
to Chairman Thomas Bliley:
<p>
"[T]he federal criminal code currently prohibits distribution of 
both child pornography and obscenity by computer."[1]
<P>
In a communication to Senator Leahy, the Justice Department agrees with 
this assessment:
<p>
"[W]e have applied current law to this emerging problem. . . . 
The Department's Criminal Division has, indeed, successfully 
prosecuted violations of federal child pornography and obscenity 
laws which were perpetrated with computer technology." [2]
<p>
Thus, while more enforcement resources may or may not be required, no case 
has been made that any new criminal laws are needed in this area. 
<p>
<h3>B.	Violations of obscenity, child pornography, and other criminal 
law online are being prosecuted</h3>
<p>
Even as the Congress rushes to enact new criminal laws, online 
obscenity and child pornography crimes are being prosecuted around the 
country under existing law.  According to the Justice Department:
<p>
<blockquote>"The Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity 
Section is aggressively investigating and prosecuting the 
distribution of child pornography and obscenity through 
computer networks, and the use of computers to locate minors 
for the purpose of sexual exploitation."[3]</blockquote> 
<p>
To the extent that any obstacles arise, Congress should examine 
whether there is a need for additional training and resources for enforcement.  
The Justice Department, the agency responsible for investigating and 
prosecuting these crimes, sees no urgent need for legislation and instead has 
urged -- prior to any congressional action -- "in-depth analysis" of the 
"number of complex legal and policy issues" raised by the need to protect 
children while respecting the First Amendment and privacy rights of 
computer users.  The precise constitutional parameters, for example, of 
criminal obscenity laws and the application of community standards doctrine 
to interactive media are currently being decided by the courts.  If 
Congressional investigation determines that there are actual gaps in current 
law, it may, then, be appropriate to investigate modernization or clarification 
of existing law.
<p>
Ironically, the Communications Decency Act as passed by the United 
States Senate as part of the telecommunications reform bill, fails to add any 
protections against online stalking and child solicitation.  Everyone is 
concerned about protecting children from threats online and off.  The Senate-
passed Communications Decency Act, however, only punishes indecency and 
obscenity, not stalking or solicitation.  It offers no help to prosecutors or police 
in prevention of prosecution of online crimes against children.
