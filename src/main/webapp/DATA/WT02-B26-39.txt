When a sad 5-year-old Fairfax County child tries to kill himself by lying in front of a school bus, or a frantic 10-year-old  holds a toy gun to his head and says he would pull the trigger if it were real, the nightmare of childhood depression becomes all too real.<p>
  For Rockville mother Brenda Souto, whose son was so despondent teachers once feared he might attempt suicide at school, raising a depressed youngster can be a terrifying struggle. <p>
For Susan Dubuque, whose son held the toy gun to his head, her son's battle with depression was a hellish journey that nearly ruined him. Today, Souto and Dubuque are among other parents who credit antidepressant medication like Prozac and similar drugs for literally saving their children's lives. <p>
"If he hadn't had this medication [Prozac], I think he probably would have eventually become so miserable . . . he would be one of the suicide statistics," says Souto of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Arlington.<p>
 Up to 8 million youngsters suffer from depression in this country, according to Peter Jensen of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda. Increasingly, children as young as 4 and 5 years old are being treated with Prozac and other antidepressants that belong to the new breed of drugs called SSRIs, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.<p>
     Though it's difficult to determine exactly how many children in this country are treated with antidepressants for either depression or other mental problems, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, doctors have some clue by reviewing information collected by IMS America, a firm that tracks data from the pharmaceutical industry.<p>
      IMS, since 1992, has tracked the number of times, called "mentions," that physicians prescribed, refilled, recommended or administered SSRIs to children.<p>
      For children in the 5- to 10-year-old age group, IMS found that the number of "mentions" of Prozac grew from 61,000 to 220,000 between 1992 and 1994.<p>
      The most recent figures -- for June 1995 to June 1996 -- show 3,000 SSRI drug "mentions" for children up to age 4. For youngsters ages 5-10, the number of times doctors prescribed, refilled or administered the drugs was 116,000. The number of "mentions" for ages 16-20 was 899,000 in that 12-month period, according to IMS figures. <p>
Though Jensen and other mental health experts believe antidepressants can be highly effective for some children who have been properly diagnosed, there still is concern that not enough is known about the safety and efficacy of these drugs for young children and that more research is needed. Research involving children and drugs like Prozac has been scant compared with studies on adult usage, says Jensen, chief of Child and Adolescent Disorders Research at NIMH in Rockville.<p>
Nevertheless, Jensen says he, like other doctors, resorts to medication for a depressed youngster when all other behavioral therapies and counseling have failed to lift the child from the depths of serious depression.<p>
"I cannot allow this child to suffer longer," says Jensen. "If we've given it our best shot, then we'll do a therapeutic trial of medication, even though we do not have all the firm evidence we would like to have."<p>
  Harold S. Koplewicz, vice chairman of psychiatry and director of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, worries that mentally and emotionally disturbed children who could greatly benefit from medication are not being treated because of the stigma attached to giving children antidepressants and a failure to accept that the child's problems may stem from a mental illness or brain disorder.<p>
"People actually believe that parents are the cause of the children's problems and if the parent is giving a pill or medicine to the child, it's because you haven't been a good parent," said Koplewicz, author of "It's Nobody's Fault, New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents" (Times Books, Random House 1996).<p>
 "The real dilemma is not are we over-medicating our kids, but are we under-treating them," says Koplewicz. "If these children have a real depression, a real illness and it is unresponsive to psychosocial interventions, they need a treatment that will make it go away."<p>
 Left untreated, the results can be disastrous, he warns. "If teenagers feel bad and we don't help them with this depression, they will go and treat themselves. They will find `medicines' they think will work -- cocaine, alcohol and marijuana. Then you have a kid that is not only depressed, but suffering from substance abuse."<p>
Results of an important new study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas -- yet to be published -- may provide doctors with the best recommendation so far for prescribing the SSRIs to youngsters.<p>
   Conducted by Graham Emslie, a professor of psychiatry, and funded by the NIMH, the study showed Prozac to be effective in treating depressed children and teenagers. Ninety-six patients suffering from severe and persistent depression, ages 8 to 18, were studied for eight weeks. Fifty-six percent of those who had received Prozac responded to treatment, compared with 33 percent in a group that received a placebo.<p>
It's the first study -- especially with young children -- that showed Prozac was more effective than the placebo, according to Emslie. Hopefully, he says, this will foster more research in this age group and result in more depressed children receiving treatment. <p>
  Despite these results, Emslie also worries about possible long-term effects. "The difficulty with children is clearly that the brain is still developing. So, we don't know how the medications affect that. We have no data that says it's harmful. But it's always a concern."<p>
"On the other hand," says Emslie, "we have some data that suggests being depressed for a period of time can affect your brain functioning over time." Data show changing of blood flow to the brain and other neurological signs, so researchers can see "biological changes occurring in the state of depression," he says. "So, if you don't treat it you have danger of more permanent changes in the brain occurring."<p>
 Mental health experts like Neal Ryan, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, stress that the newer SSRIs are much safer than the older group of antidepressants called tricyclics. <p>
"I think they (SSRIs) will be the first-line treatment everywhere," Ryan predicts.<p>
 SSRIs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for adult use only. The drugs carry a warning label that they have not been tested on children. Doctors, however, can prescribe for children.<p>
 "Medication has taken such a lambasting," says parent Susan Dubuque of Richmond, whose son, Nicholas, now 12, has taken Ritalin, Prozac and other antidepressants over the years to treat disorders. <p>
"There have been certain cases of abuse and misuse. But I'll tell you when it works it really works," says Dubuque, who has written "A Parent's Survival Guide to Childhood Depression," published this year by the Center for Applied Psychology Inc.<p>
    Burned into her memory is that terrifying night Nicholas cowered in a closet, pointed a toy gun to his head and threatened to kill himself if it were real. She said he was hysterical, crying and pleading, "Please help me."<p>
   After years of dealing with a child's anger and sadness and seeking medical help, Dubuque says it's frustrating to deal with critics who don't understand the severity of depression in children and what it is like to raise such a child.<p>
   "People say, `Instead of giving the child a pill, why don't you find out what is wrong with him.' I just want to say, `I did. I have. And the problem is he's depressed.' The reality is it's a physical disorder. You wouldn't say, `Don't give your child insulin if he is a diabetic.' " <p>
A Bethesda mother said her young son's depression became so deep that by the age of 12 he was suicidal and she had to "hide all the knives in the house."<p>
"It was scary. He talked about feeling useless and [that it was] not worth living. He left the house one day for a long walk and later told his therapist that his plan had been to walk out in front of cars and be killed." <p>
 He has since been treated off and on with Prozac and Zoloft for depression and the stimulant Dexedrine for attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.<p>
Though his bouts with depression have lifted somewhat, "I'm afraid to take him off medication," she says. "I fear the risk of suicide. If I can just get him through the teenage years alive, then the rest of his life may work out."<p>
     It was long thought that young children could not be depressed, so depression in children was likely misdiagnosed or overlooked, according to Jensen. In the last couple of decades that all has changed, and now there is a sense of urgency in the medical field to diagnose and treat children who suffer from depression. <p>
In fact, beginning in 1997, the most comprehensive nationwide study on children and mental disorders in this country will be conducted by the NIMH, in conjunction with other agencies, including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Department of Education, and Center for Mental Health Services. <p>
The study will survey about 14,000 children, ages 4 to 17, and monitor them for a minimum of two years, according to Jensen. The goal is to learn more about the causes of mental disorders in children, how they are being treated, the quality of care, and why some kids are falling through the cracks either through misdiagnosis, insurance problems or other faults in the system.<p>
     Children under stress, who experience a traumatic loss, or who have learning, attention or conduct disorders are typically at a higher risk for depression, according to experts at the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.<p>
         Early diagnosis and treatment is critical for children suffering from depression.<p>
        The behavior of depressed children often can differ from the behavior of depressed adults, say doctors. Signs of depression in youngsters can include persistent sadness, boredom or low energy; inability to enjoy previously favorite activities; increased irritability; frequent complaints of physical illnesses; major changes in sleeping or eating patterns; frequent absences from school or poor performance in school. <p>
Children and adolescents who are depressed may say they want to be dead or talk about suicide. Depressed adolescents may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way to feel better. And sometimes children who cause trouble at home or school may be depressed but not know it, according to the Academy.<p>
     School educators, counselors and psychologists often are among the first to observe symptoms of depression or other disorders in children. <p>
Fairfax County school psychologist Martha Ozer is among those who have seen the heartbreak of childhood depression.<p>
"I've seen where a child writes `I wish I were dead' or `I'm going to kill myself' on a paper  that they were going to turn in and they knew the teacher would see it," recalls Ozer, who works with elementary school children . <p>
"We take it very seriously because very young children don't really understand death and they don't understand that when people die it is final," she says.<p>
       When a child talks of suicide, parents are asked to take their child for an emergency evaluation by a mental health professional. If they refuse to address the problem, Ozer says the school must call Child Protective Services for the child's own safety.<p>
        "Lots of times it is just so horrifying to a parent that a child would talk of killing [himself] that they just can't believe it so they may not actually follow up immediately."<p>
         She recalled one child who made an attempt -- a suicidal gesture -- in class. "It was a cry for help. It could have been more serious than it was." <p>
    In another case, a 5-year-old distraught over family problems lay down in front of his school bus in an attempt to kill himself. Fortunately he was not injured, says Ozer. Another suicide threat came from a child whose family was having financial difficulties, and the youngster "thought it would just be best for the family not to have her around any more."<p>
      "Today, some children are under tremendous stress . . . certainly more so than 20 years ago," says Ozer. "Children and families live very fast-paced lives and many times both parents work outside the home and there are child-care givers. Just the issue of who cares for the child is an issue that can cause stress."<p>
      "School curriculums are at a faster pace and lots of activities sometimes leave kids stretched to the limit and it's difficult for them," Ozer says. "It can leave them with not enough down time or enough time when a child can actually relate to the parent."<p>
        Jensen also cites societal changes like divorce rates and increased mobility as possible factors that can lead to depression. "One might argue that life is more complex and more difficult and in some ways more stressful than in earlier years," says Jensen.<p>
      Environmental factors, like kids' exposure to lead, have been shown to result in more behavioral problems, he says. Since depression can be biological, doctors note that depressed children often have a parent who has suffered from the disorder.<p>
Elizabeth Weller, professor of psychiatry, pediatrics and neuroscience at Ohio State University, worries that not all children are being properly evaluated and diagnosed before being prescribed antidepressant medication.<p>
  "When you look at the average pediatrician who spends around 11 minutes per patient and a family practitioner, seven minutes . . . you can't diagnose a little kid in that period of time. Paper-pencil tests are not even made to make the diagnosis and come up with a score saying this kid is depressed. But based on that they give the medication. It is really sad," says Weller. "If you give it to the properly diagnosed child it really helps," she adds.<p>
But constraints placed by managed care often bar doctors from being able to spend enough time with young patients to reach a clear diagnosis.<p>
 Even Dubuque has worried about the uncertainty over possible long-term drug risks.<p>
 "I'd be stupid not to," she says. "But when you are dealing with a child who is suffering from an acute bout of an emotional problem, you take crisis action. If we wouldn't have, there may not have been a long term to worry about."<p>
