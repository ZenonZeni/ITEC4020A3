 MEXICO: ZAPATISTAS AND GOVERNMENT AGREE ON FURTHER NEGOTIATING SESSION

 Two days of discussions between representatives of the government and the 
Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional (EZLN) ended on 17 July with some 
progress. The two sides reached preliminary  agreement on the second item on 
the agenda of peace negotiations. The talks have been going on since April 
1995 in the Chiapas town of San Andres Larrainzar. A full negotiating 
session on 'democracy and justice' is due to take place on 6 August, but the 
two sides appear to be as far apart as ever on the fundamental issues.

 The talks reflected the EZLN's determination to project itself as a 
national organisation, going far beyond issues affecting Chiapas. It set out 
its twin aims for the next round of negotiations as: 'Promotion of a regime 
of social coexistence fully covered by the rule of law and the construction 
of a democratic development that permits a peaceful political life and 
intense citizen participation.'

 'Comandante Tacho' of the EZLN was dismissive of the government's proposals 
on these issues: 'Democracy is much more than honest elections, extending to 
citizens' participation in all spheres of social, productive, political and 
cultural life.'

 This projection was further seen in a subsequent meeting in the Lacandona 
jungle on 22 July between EZLN representatives and members of the bank 
debtors' organisation known as El Barzon, which claims 1m members, and sees 
much in common with the Zapatistas in its struggle for more favourable 
treatment from the federal government. The two groups signed a mutual 
defence pact, and agreed to form a front of civic organisations to press for 
changes in the Mexican economic model.

 In Guerrero, the new guerrilla group known as the Ejercito Popular 
Revolucionario (EPR) confirmed its insurgent credentials on 19 July when it 
issued a communique, signed by 'Comandante Antonio,'  claiming 
responsibility for an attack on a military patrol three days earlier near 
Chilapa.

 LOPEZ OBRADOR WINS

 Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 43, was formally proclaimed the new leader of 
the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD) on 17 July. He received 
264,565 votes, 73.9% of the total, in internal elections.

 Lopez Obrador, former PRD candidate for governor of Tabasco, is regarded as 
on the radical wing of the PRD. He replaces Porfirio Munoz Ledo on 3 August.

 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: CAMILION QUITS OVER ARMS SCANDAL: MENEM FINDS A JOB 
FOR DEFEATED BUENOS AIRES MAYOR

 When he announced the appointment of the outgoing mayor of Buenos Aires, 
Jorge Dominguez, as defence minister on 21 July, President Carlos Menem 
insisted that the departure of Oscar Camilion, who resigned five days 
earlier, had nothing to do with the scandal concerning arms sales to Ecuador 
in which the minister had become implicated.

 Two in one week. For the second time in a week Menem had to let a long-
serving minister go, amid protestations that the departure had no particular 
motive (see Page 334/96). Camilion, like Rodolfo Barra, had apparently come 
to the end of his time, nothing more.

 But everybody knew that Camilion had been hanging on by his finger-nails 
for months, as the judicial inquiry into the arms sales drew closer and the 
clamour from the opposition benches grew louder (see Page 238/96). The final 
straw came when federal judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence 
of a cover-up to request the lifting of Camilion's ministerial immunity.

 Menem took five days, during which he was on a visit to the United States, 
to mull over the resignation. He finally decided Camilion must go, but took 
care to make clear that the government was no more involved in the scandal 
than the minister: 'Argentina sold the arms that ended up in Ecuador to 
private entities,' he claimed.

 But Urso based his application to interrogate Camilion on the testimony of 
the air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, who said he had warned the 
defence minister that the planes supposedly bound for Venezuela were 
stopping off in Guayaquil. The ministry took no action.

 The only suspects to be arrested so far are Luis Sarlenga, former president 
of the company that made the weapons, Fabricaciones Militares (owned by the 
defence ministry), and two other senior officials of the company.

 The departure of Camilion will help to mend fences with Peru, where 
indignation was widespread that an old ally should lend itself to supplying 
arms to an enemy in a time of conflict.

 Dominguez has fallen on his feet, after suffering a humiliating defeat in 
the mayoral elections on 30 June at the hands of the Radical candidate, 
Fernando de la Rua. Despite finishing third, behind the Frepaso candidate, 
Dominguez was told by Menem that he was 'the best mayor Buenos Aires has 
had.'

 AMIA BOMB SUSPECTS HELD

 Prosecutors investigating the bombing of the Amia Jewish community centre 
in July 1994 suspect two Buenos Aires policemen of Arab origin of supplying 
the pick-up truck loaded with explosives that was used in the attack, in 
which 86 people died.

 One of the two, who have not been arrested, is thought to be close to a 
'prominent member of the Lebanese community' who was connected in some way 
with the owner of the vehicle, Carlos Telleldin, the only suspect charged 
with involvement in the incident.

 Following Telleldin's evidence, judge Juan Jose Galeano has linked the 
vehicle with an extortion racket run by 14 Buenos Aires provincial 
policemen, arrested earlier this month.

 ARGENTINA: ECONOMY: STRIKE THREAT OVER SPENDING CUTS: MENEM BACKS CAVALLO 
(AGAIN) AFTER ROW WITH UNIONS AND PJ

 While economy minister Domingo Cavallo threatened to resign unless his 
latest economic adjustment measures were implemented by congress, President 
Menem took responsibility for whipping dissident members of the ruling 
Partido Justicialista (PJ) back into line.

 Menem imposed order in the party after ratifying yet again his faith in 
Cavallo. The latter's attempts to make amends for failing to meet fiscal 
targets set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were bitterly 
criticised within the PJ (see Page 316/96).

 'The adjustment measures are mine, not Cavallo's,' Menem said on 19 July. 
Some 2.4m workers stand to suffer from a reduction in state aid for 
dependent families, and from the taxation of food subsidies paid to some 
1.2m employees by companies as part of their total wage. The government is 
also considering the abolition of transport subsidies and imposing value 
added tax (IVA) on bus, metro and train fares -all wildly unpopular measures 
with the unions.

 The Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT) has called a general strike on 
8 August, 10 days before negotiations begin with the IMF to secure a waiver 
on the agreed fiscal targets. The unions have also threatened to seek a 
court ruling overturning the presidential decrees implementing the 
adjustment measures.

 Opposition economists expect the result to be a big fall in consumption 
rather than an increase in tax revenues. The government expects the measures 
to save up to US Dollars 1bn a year. The main employers' organisation, Union 
Industrial Argentina (UIA), has given its support, regarding the measures as 
preferable to tax increases.

 The fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn for the first six months of 1996 
was US Dollars 8m higher than the figure agreed with the IMF for the whole 
year.

 AUTONOMOUS BUENOS AIRES

 The first autonomous government of Buenos Aires will take office on 6 
August, in accordance with the first decision taken by the assembly drawing 
up the capital's political statutes, the 60-member Convencion de 
Representantes.

 Senador Graciela Fernandez Meijide, of Frepaso, was elected president of 
the convention on 19 July. Frepaso has 25 seats in the assembly, against 19 
for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), 11 for the PJ and five for Nueva 
Dirigencia.

 CUBA/UNITED STATES: DIPLOMACY: CLINTON FUDGE FAILS TO SATISFY ALLIES: 
HELMS-BURTON CONFLICTS POSTPONED, NOT PREVENTED

 The option chosen by President Clinton on implementation of the Helms-
Burton Act (see Page 325/96) was a skilful fudge: the law would be applied, 
but not yet. It was not lost on Latin American countries that the diplomatic 
clout of the European Union (EU) had caused Washington to postpone taking 
action under the most controversial section of the law.

 Six-month moratorium. The President's statement on 16 July maintained the 
right of US citizens to sue foreign 'traffickers' in confiscated properties 
in Cuba under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, but took to make sure that 
no cases would come to court for at least six months -that is, until 
February 1997.

 Clinton's calculation is that he will have done enough to avoid alienating 
the Florida Cuba lobby without driving the US into open conflict with the EU 
or its partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

 The first reaction of Senator Jesse Helms, joint sponsor of the law, was 
not promising, however: his spokesman said the President's decision was a 
'capitulation' to Castro and his EU allies.

 Clinton's best hope is that he wins the presidential elections in November, 
and can then extend the moratorium or, better still, quietly let Title III 
drop. But that will depend on the correlation of forces in the new Congress.

 Pressure for change. In the meantime, the US proposes to continue efforts 
over the next six months to persuade its allies to bring greater pressure to 
bear on the Castro government to introduce democratic freedoms in the 
island. If they do not do so, Title III could then be brought into action.

 In other words, Washington still insists on the 'extra-territorial' 
application of its national legislation -a point underlined a few days later 
when proposals were put forward in Washington to prosecute foreign companies 
trading or maintaining economic contacts with Libya or Iran.

 This position could be storing up trouble for the future, as it is 
precisely this point that has most enraged EU, Nafta and other Latin 
American countries. The EU has said it proposes to continue with 
preparations for retaliatory measures, and EU Commission president Jacques 
Santer has said Clinton's moratorium, while welcome, is not enough.

 The Spanish-based Sol-Melia hotel group, with extensive interests in Cuba, 
was among the first EU companies to begin its own campaign, on 22 July, to 
ensure that Titles III and IV are never applied. Sol-Melia is one of the 
foreign companies already notified that it is liable to sanctions under the 
Helms-Burton legislation.

 Title IV refers to the denial of visas to executives of companies dealing 
with Cuba, and is a mere pinprick compared with Title III. But pinpricks are 
annoying, and much has already been made by commentators in EU countries and 
Canada about the absurdity of refusing to allow children of, say, Sherritt 
International executives to visit Disneyland for their holidays.

 President Fidel Castro is making the most of the divisions among the 
Western allies. He emphasised in a briefing to Spanish journalists on 19 
July that the Helms-Burton Act was a 'sword of Damocles' hanging over the 
sovereignty of all nations and sets a precedent with dire implications for 
international trading relations in general.

 'AVIONETAS' AT UN

 Attempts by Washington to secure a resolution from the United Nations 
Security Council condemning Cuba for the shooting-down of two light aircraft 
in February seem to have come unstuck. US ambassador Madeleine Albright said 
on 22 July that she was satisfied there was a consensus in the Council 
against military attacks on civilian aircraft, but she was prepared to tone 
down a draft resolution prepared by the US.

 A report by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) criticised 
the incident and appeared to back the US position that it took place in 
international airspace (see RC-96-06). But the ICAO board did not 
specifically condemn the Cuban government, and US allies on the Security 
Council see Washington's campaign for sanctions against Cuba over the 
incident as part of its policy of isolating the Castro regime, and are 
reluctant to go along.

 SOUTHERN CONE: BRIEFS

 Chile's exports will rise to US Dollars 18bn in 1997, 13% higher than the 
US Dollars 16bn forecast for this year, according to the finance ministry. 
Last year services accounted for US Dollars 3.1bn of exports, the third 
largest figure in the region after Brazil and Mexico.

 Consumer prices are expected to have risen by 0.2-0.3% in July, compared 
with 0.8% for the same month of 1995, bringing inflation in Chile to 7.7% 
for the last 12 months, the finance ministry has announced.

 The state copper company, Codelco, has forecast a US Dollars 500m fall in 
income to US Dollars 1.2bn for this year, as a result of the Sumitomo 
scandal causing copper prices on the international markets to plummet.

 Forestry exports fell 20% in value to US Dollars 769m, and 11.3% in volume, 
in the first five months of the year, compared with the same period of 1995.

 Atilio Fernandez, the former integration minister, has been appointed head 
of Paraguay's Privatisations Council, his explicit brief being to speed up 
the sell-off process begun by President Wasmosy in 1993.

 Uruguay's public payroll has been cut back by 16,754 posts over the past 18 
months, to 239,146 officials.

 Uruguay's state electricity company, UTE, is to link up with the joint 
venture between the Uruguayan oil company ANCAP and the government of 
Argentina's Entre Rios province to build a gas pipeline on both sides of the 
river Uruguay, which divides the two countries. UTE is to invest US Dollars 
120m in a 350MW natural gas station to form part of the infrastructure.

 A new law will end the state monopoly on the financing of the construction 
of new homes, leaving the Banco Hipotecario, the current credit provider, to 
adapt to a new and competitive market.

 BRAZIL: ECONOMY: SETBACK IN JUNE TRADE FIGURES: BUT TELECOMS LEGISLATION IS 
THROUGH CONGRESS AT LAST

 External account figures released in mid-July were not as good as expected, 
causing the government to promise a thorough revision of its projections for 
this year. But, on the positive side, real progress was made with 
legislation on opening up the economy.

 Trade back in deficit. The May trade deficit of US Dollars 268m was 
followed by a disappointing US Dollars 327m deficit in June, with exports 
6.77% down on the previous month. The shortfall for the first half-year was 
US Dollars 296m -which makes the official prediction of a US Dollars 500m 
trade surplus for the year seem unlikely. The government concedes that the 
current account deficit will exceed US Dollars 2bn for the whole of 1996.

 The government, naturally, has been putting a favourable gloss on the 
results. The finance ministry's economic policy secretary, Jose Roberto 
Mendonca de Barros, pointed out that the growth in imports in June was 
largely accounted for by a 15.2% jump in machinery and equipment purchases. 
'The pick-up in investments is much more important than the import figures,' 
he said, adding that a reviving economy was bound to suck in imports.

 Mendonca de Barros noted that direct investments were pouring in, most of 
them related to Mercosur projects, making the accumulated reserves of US 
Dollars 60bn an advantage rather than a problem.

 A record total of foreign investments of US Dollars 1.1bn was recorded in 
June, bringing the total for the first six months up to US Dollars 4.37bn, 
according to central bank figures released on 19 July.

 Mexican spectre. Not everybody agrees with the government's upbeat 
assessment. The June trade figures suggest to some economists -those of what 
might be called the Dornbusch persuasion- that the spectre of a Mexican-
style crisis has still not been dispelled (see Page 268/96), and the 
deterioration of the external accounts should set the alarm bells ringing.

 Non-government projections of the current account deficit this year are in 
the range of US Dollars 4bn-US Dollars 5.6bn. And critics also point out 
that much of the foreign capital is coming to Brazil because of what are 
still among the highest real interest rates in the world.

 Cellular telephones law. The most impressive legislative advance was the 
approval on 18 July by the senate, by 55 votes to six, of the law regulating 
private participation in cellular telephony, satellite broadcasting and data 
transmission. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the bill into law 
on the following day.

 Cellular telephony is expected to attract foreign investments totalling US 
Dollars 5bn over the next five years, opening the floodgates of investment 
in telecoms. The compromise that enabled the law to complete its passage 
through congress means that companies taking part must have at least 51% 
Brazilian capital for the first three years. The former state monopoly 
company, Telebras, is authorised to set up subisidiares to compete for 
concesisons.

 Nineteen consortia. The communications minister, Sergio Motta, said the 
first bids for cellular telephony services would be called in the next few 
weeks, and the country would be divided into 10 regions for the purpose. 
About 19 consortia, already in existence or in formation, are expected to 
participate.

 Cardoso said at the signing ceremony that the government was in no hurry to 
complete its reform programme, but wanted to be sure that they were the 
right ones for the country. He nevertheless did not neglect the opportunity 
to appeal to congress to speed up approval of the big constitutional reforms 
that are still bogged down there, notably the social security amendments.

 A much watered-down version of this reform was given a second reading and 
approved by the lower house of congress by 318 votes to 136 on 17 July. The 
concept of 'years of contributions' rather than 'length of service' as 
qualification for a retirement pension is preserved, but in other respects 
the lower house badly mauled the government's original draft (see RB-96-04). 
Civil servants and teachers keep their privileges, including the right to 
retire on full pension after 35 years' service, and no minimum qualifying 
age is laid down for civil servants.

 Worst of all, from the government's point of view, it failed to carry the 
proposal to reduce the  state's contribution to financing the pension funds 
of publicly-owned companies.

[TEX] MALUF'S STAR RISES 

 Mayor Paulo Maluf of Sao Paulo, with a 52% approval rating in the latest 
opinion polls, looks increasingly likely to carry his unknown protege Celso 
Pitta into office on his coat-tails. While the mayoral campaign of former 
planning minister Jose Serra appears to be flagging, Pitta's is prospering.

 Pitta, born in Rio de Janeiro, is a former executive in the Maluf family 
business, and is clearly Maluf's man. He also has the undeniable electoral 
disadvantage of being black. But Maluf's vote-winning 'Projeto Cingapura', a 
low-cost housing and favela improvements scheme, financed with a US Dollars 
150m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank, could make all the 
difference to his chances -as well as keeping Maluf in the public eye and 
serving as a springboard for his undoubted presidential ambitions.

 Cardoso's PSDB party regards the election of Serra as vitally important 
both to the government's prospects in 1997 and to the chances of Cardoso's 
standing for re-election. If Serra were to lose, the government would settle 
for a victory for the Partido dos Trabalhadores' candidate, Luiza Erundina, 
who is still ahead in the polls.

 BOLIVIA: POLITICS & SOCIETY: UPROAR OVER PENSIONS REFORM: DECISION ON NEW 
SYSTEM PUT OFF AFTER MASS PROTESTS

 President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's determination to complete his 
programme of basic reforms before electoral politics take over completely -
the presidential polls are only a year away- suffered a setback with the 
decision to postpone discussion of the draft pensions law until August. 
Popular opposition to this measure shows no sign of abating.

 Political moratorium. Sanchez de Lozada, whose inability to delegate is 
notorious, has tried to put politics on hold while he completes his grand 
design. But the moratorium has proved no easier to impose on the streets 
than on his party, the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR).

 The pensions bill presented to a special session of congress on 10 July was 
met with a general strike, followed by mass demonstrations. Workers objected 
to the whole idea of individual policies replacing a fully state-financed 
scheme, particularly if the new private pension fund companies (AFPs) were 
to be based on Chilean models, and perhaps controlled by Chilean interests.

 The latter possibility was immediately struck out of the draft legislation. 
The President promised an international competition, and said the 
concessions would be awarded in November.

 A feature that provoked intense opposition was Sanchez de Lozada's 
insistence on fixing retirement age for the new system at 65. In the face of 
massive resistance, he conceded that workers could choose their own 
retirement age from 55 onwards, but if they wanted to draw their full 
pension, they would have to carry on working to 65.

 As the well-informed La Paz newsletter Siglo XXI points out, only 14% of 
Bolivia's 120,000 pensioners are 65 or over -and only 3.6% of Bolivians can 
hope to reach that age. It suggested that the next draft should lay down a 
minimum contributions level to qualify for a full pension -along Brazilian 
lines- rather than a qualifying age.

 One important concession has already been made: the old state pensions 
system will remain in existence even after the AFPs begin to operate. 
Sanchez de Lozada's main argument in favour of a new system is that it will 
extend coverage to all 3.5m adult Bolivians, rather than the tiny number 
covered by the present system.

 Everybody, wage-earner or not, is to receive a minimum of about US Dollars 
200 a year for life out of the proceeds of the capitalisation programme.

 Opposition to the capitalisation programme, however, remains widespread -as 
reflected in the decision to renegotiate terms for the gas pipeline with the 
US company Enron and postpone the capitalisation of the state energy 
company, YPFB, until September.

 The Chilean factor is also present in political opposition to the 
capitalisation of the state railways, which have passed into the hands of 
the Chilean Cruz Blanca group. Plans for mass lay-offs of the feather-bedded 
workforce caused immediate uproar.

 Similar lay-off proposals provoked strike threats from the workforce of the 
national airline, Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), now controlled by the 
Brazilian Vasp group.

 Political reform. Another difficult issue postponed until the second 
extraordinary session of congress, opening on 22 July, was the 
redistribution of congressional seats, to introduce a single-candidate 
system in place of lists for half the country's constituencies.

 This long-overdue reform set off a battle royal between departments, and no 
political party was prepared to concede any seats, for fear of losing out in 
next year's elections.

 The proximity of the elections has caused some edginess in the MNR, despite 
the President's attempts to keep the lid firmly down. The president of the 
senate, Juan Carlos Duran, has made no secret of his ambitions, and he has a 
national reputation. His lower house equivalent, Guillermo Bedregal, has 
also begun manoeuvring, with the aim of leading an MNR backlash against 
Sanchez de Lozada's preference for non-party independents in his cabinet.

 The minister with the best prospects appears to be Carlos Sanchez Berzain 
(interior), while an interesting outsider could be former planning minister 
Enrique Garcia. But he has just been re-elected president of the Caracas-
based Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF), and presumably has other things 
on his mind.

 BRAZIL: BRIEFS

 Banco de Credito Nacional, Brazil's fifth largest private bank, is to buy 
Banco Itamaraty as part of the central bank's programme to strengthen the 
fragile banking system, in which 100 out of 246 banks are expected to be 
'absorbed' or closed down. The two banks' combined assets will exceed US 
Dollars 11bn.

 Two investment banks, Cindam and Fonte, are also to merge, with combined 
assets totalling US Dollars 1.7bn.

 The Brazilian government has extended its alcohol fuel programme, due to 
end this December, for a further three years due to its environmental 
advantages. Subsidies cost Petrobras US Dollars 400m in the first quarter of 
1996 alone.

 Petrobras announced expected record production levels of 845,000bpd in 
1996, 18% up on last year. The increase was due to productivity gains, and 
the discovery of new reserves in Argentina, Ecuador, and the Bahia de Campos 
field, off the coast near Rio de Janeiro.

 Brazil's tax receipts totalled US Dollars 46.9bn for the first half of 
1996. The low figure, well below the government's expectations, is due to 
the slow-down in economic activity.

 The number of credit card transactions reached a record 188m and were worth 
US Dollars 11.8bn in the first half of 1996, a 24% rise on the same period 
of last year. One in 10 of the population has access to 'plastic' money.

 Brazil and Japan are to resume negotiations  regarding the former's 70% 
import tariff on foreign vehicles. The measure, introduced last year, cut 
Japanese car sales in Brazil by 95%.

 A government study suggests the country will receive US Dollars 220.5bn in 
private investment up to the year 2000, including US Dollars 10-12bn from 
privatisation.

 REGION: TRENDS: RESENTMENT GROWS TOWARDS WASHINGTON: THE REGION FEELS THE 
BIG STICK IS BEING BRANDISHED AGAIN

 Any lingering illusions about the end of the Cold War and the triumph of 
free-market capitalism making the world a simpler and safer place -the 'end 
of history' theory- must have been dispelled by the recent succession of 
issues concerning perceived national interests that have brought the United 
States into conflict with its allies and trading partners. The consequences 
for Latin America and the Caribbean include a growing feeling that Uncle 
Sam's big stick has been brought back out of the cupboard.

 The Helms-Burton Act, which has succeeded in lining up the European Union, 
Canada and the whole of Latin America against Washington, is seen by the EU 
as both an ideological aberration and a threat to its commercial interests. 
But in the US, zealots regard it as much as part of a crusade against the 
last remnant of Marxist totalitarianism in the Western hemisphere as a 
defence of citizens' property.

 In Latin America and the Caribbean, and particularly in Mexico, the Act is 
seen as part of a wider US attempt to stop the region developing independent 
economic relations. Such a perception may boost Mercosur, for example, at 
the expense of the US-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas. It 
certainly drove Chile away from Nafta and into the arms of Mercosur.

 These differing views reflect the extent to which US foreign policy in 
recent years has become a mish-mash of sometimes conflicting aims. These are 
highlighted by confrontations over two other issues: drugs and bananas.

 1. Drugs. As far as Washington is concerned, its pressure on Colombia in 
general and President Ernesto Samper in particular are acts of legitimate 
self-defence: drugs are a threat to its society, and countries that allow 
them to flow into the US become liable to sanctions.

 The uneasy reaction of Latin America is summed up in the words of Simon 
Consalvi, a former senior Venezuelan diplomat. He described the withdrawal 
of Samper's US visa as 'part of an escalation that could lead anywhere.' 
Samper himself saw it as an 'imperialist' act, a unilateral assault on the 
'South' -a view shared by the Non-Aligned Movement, of which he is chairman.

 Samper's US-born wife, Jacquin Strouss, singled out US envoy Myles 
Frechette as an exponent of an outmoded interventionist style of diplomacy. 
She warned that pressure on Colombia was stirring up an anti-American mood 
that she had never seen before.

 This feeling that US ambassadors are striking proconsular attitudes is not 
confined to Colombia: in Argentina, for example, the outspoken interventions 
of envoy James Cheek have been widely resented. Viewed from the south, 
officials in Washington and their representatives on the ground do not even 
pretend to have much respect for the institutions of the countries with 
which they deal.

 2. Bananas. The small Caribbean producers, particularly the Windward 
Islands, which are almost totally dependent on exports of the fruit for 
their foreign exchange earnings, have been lobbying Washington frantically 
in an attempt to persuade it to drop its objections to the EU's market 
regime. But the US has proved impervious to pleading, insisting that the 
regime is unfair to US marketing companies and should be subjected to a 
World Trade Organisation disputes panel.

 The argument that this narrow view of US interests could rebound on 
Washington if island economies collapsed and sent a flood of drugs and 
migrants northwards has failed to make much impact.

 The Caribbean's experience is similar to that of countries exporting to the 
US, which have found non-tariff barriers mysteriously appearing even as the 
free-trade rhetoric flows from Washington: reformulated gasoline exports 
from Venezuela and Brazil, which became the first issue to be resolved by 
the WTO's disputes panel, are a case in point.

 If Latin America and the Caribbean are coming to regard US policy towards 
them as a mixture of bullying and blinkered hypocrisy, that is a worrying 
trend indeed.

 REGION: DEBT&LENDING ROUND-UP

 ARGENTINA/ Debt grows. The foreign debt has grown by almost 57% over the 
past four years, according to an economy ministry report released on 18 
July. The total for both public and private sectors reached US Dollars 
91.47bn in March this year, compared with US Dollars 58.41bn at the end of 
1991 -a 56.59% increase.

 The public sector debt increased during the first quarter of 1996 by US 
Dollars 2.59bn.

 During the same period, Argentina's foreign exchange reserves increased by 
109.36%, from US Dollars 8.97bn to US Dollars 18.78bn.

 BRAZIL/ IDB road loan. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and 
Germany's Dresdner Bank group have agreed to lend US Dollars 25m for the 
construction of a 15km, six-lane toll road in Rio de Janeiro.

 Total cost of the project will be US Dollars 173.5m, of which  Rio 
municipal government will contribute US Dollars 112m.

 COSTA RICA/ Unused credits. The government is proposing to cancel US 
Dollars 450m worth of undisbursed loans from the IDB, including a US Dollars 
400m credit to the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). The 
country is paying US Dollars 4m a year to keep the loans open.

 ECUADOR/ Judicial reform. The World Bank is lending US Dollars 10.7m to 
help finance modernisation and strengthening of the judicial system. The 
government is to provide an additional US Dollars 3.6m.

 Spanish credit. Formal signing of a US Dollars 110m credit from the Spanish 
government for the extension of the new trolleybus system in Quito was 
completed on 18 July.

 PERU/ Paris Club deal. President Fujimori announced in Lima on 20 July that 
a restructuring deal had been reached with the country's Paris Club 
creditors, along the lines achieved by Russia in May.

 Payments are to be made over 20 years, with a maximum of US Dollars 450m-US 
Dollars 600m for the first three years. The total to be paid will be US 
Dollars 7bn, a reduction from the US Dollars 9bn owed to Paris Club 
countries. Peru's outstanding commercial debt totals some US Dollars 10bn.

 REGION/ World Bank appointment. Guillermo Perry Rubio, former finance 
minister of Colombia, has been appointed the World Bank's chief economist 
for Latin America and the Caribbean from 1 August.

 Before serving in the Samper government, Perry was a Liberal member of 
congress and of the 1991 constitutional assembly. He was minister of energy 
and mines 1986-88.

 World Bank lending back to normal. Latin American and Caribbean countries 
borrowed a total of US Dollars 4.44bn from the World Bank in the 12 months 
to 30 June 1996. The total for the previous year was US Dollars 6.06bn. The 
fall, the Bank says, reflects Mexico's recovery from the financial crisis at 
the end of 1994.

 Assistance to the financial sector fell from US Dollars 1.4bn to US Dollars 
11.9m, and lending for public sector management from US Dollars 1.06bn to US 
Dollars 666m.

 Most WB lending to the region was in International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (IBRD) loans at favourable market rates: US Dollars 4.05bn, 
down from US Dollars 5.71bn in the previous year. But lending at 
concessional rates, from the International Development Association, was up 
from US Dollars 345.2m to US Dollars 390.3m.

 Argentina was the bank's fourth-largest borrower, with US Dollars 1.51bn, 
Brazil sixth (US Dollars 875m) and Mexico eighth (US Dollars 526.5m).

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Help for poor. The IDB is to lend US Dollars 28m to 
finance community infrastructure and social services aimed at the poor. 
Projects include child care, education and conservation schemes.

 GUATEMALA: ECONOMY: RESOURCE LIMITS THREATEN PEACE DEAL: QUESTIONMARK HANGS 
OVER ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

 With the country now looking forward to the signing of the final peace 
accords between the government and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional 
Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrillas, (see Page 308/96) most likely to be 
initialed in September, attention is now being turned towards the economy, 
and the cost of peace.

 Questionmark over resources. A major step in the peace process was the 
socio-economic and agrarian accords agreed in May, from which the URNG 
negotiators had withdrawn their most radical demands, in particular the 
reference to the 'social function of land', and in return accepted somewhat 
loose promises of social reform. But the cost of implementing these accords 
is estimated to be between US Dollars 600m and US Dollars 900m, and the 
government's planning secretariat calculates that about US Dollars 2.3bn 
will be needed to pay for the rehabilitation of those areas affected by the 
conflict. Though some international aid is certain to be forthcoming, a 
questionmark hangs over the economy's ability to deliver the necessary 
resources.

 Economic indicators for 1995 were encouraging. Overall GDP growth 
accelerated to 4.5% from the previous year's 4%. The fastest growing sectors 
were mining (11%); banking & real estate (8%); construction (7.9%) and 
electricity, gas & water (7%). Agricultural growth was sluggish at 2.9%. 
Official figures for urban unemployment showed a fall from to 4.3% from 5.2% 
in 1994. Forecasts for 1996 place GDP growth at 5%.

 Export revenues increased 28.5% to US Dollars 2.2bn in 1995, mainly as a 
result of high coffee and sugar prices. Oil exports also performed well, 
rising in value by 38%. Exports to other Central American countries grew by 
23%, thanks to an agreement to consult on tariff changes in April 1995. The 
trade deficit, however, widened by 4.3% over the previous year as the import 
bill rose to  Dollars 3.3bn. Imports of raw materials and capital goods 
outstripped consumer goods for the first time in nearly a decade.

 Coffee, sugar and bananas account for 42% of export revenues and the recent 
dip in world prices has highlighted the need to widen the range of products 
the country sells abroad. While Guatemala succeeded in raising the value of 
non-traditional agro-exports from US Dollars 50m in 1986 to US Dollars 141m 
in 1989, progress since has been disappointing. (See table)

 The manufacturing sector suffered with the decline of the Central American 
Common Market in the 1980s and has responded inadequately to the lifting of 
tariff barriers in the 1990s. The country is an important exporter of 
chemicals, cosmetics, paper and processed foods, but manufacturing as a 
percentage of GDP fell from 16.7% in 1980 to 14.3% in 1994.

 Last year's trade deficit of US Dollars 1.1bn could widen if world prices 
continue to fall, but the current account will be helped by remittances from 
Guatemalans abroad as the government allows commercial banks to open dollar 
accounts. The peace dividend may well include an increase in the number of 
tourists, whose numbers rose from 537,374 in 1994 to 563, 478 last year.  
However the murder of one Briton and a US citizen in January has reawakened 
safety fears. 

 Domestically, President Alvaro Arzu is likely to continue the tight fiscal 
policy of his predecessor, who brought the fiscal deficit down from 1.4% of 
GDP to 0.7%, the lowest lower in Central America. Keeping inflation during 
the year to 8.6% was a considerable achievement.

 Though the three percentage point increase in VAT in January this year and 
the temptation to loosen monetary policy to spur growth may fuel inflation 
pressures, Arzu is unlikely to let prices get out of control.

 Privatisation on the cards. Despite strong trade union opposition the Arzu 
government has expressed its commitment to a privatisation programme. Least 
controversial are the loss-making rail network Fegua, the milk producer 
Prolac, and some municipal services. Electricity privatisation is going to 
be tricky, as the Guatemalan Electric Company, EESGA, the distributor, is 
refusing to pay its debts to the National Electricity Institute, Inde, the 
generator. However, in 1995 the Venezuelan government granted a US Dollars 
35 million loan to help modernise the country's electricity network.

 The state telecommunications company Guatel is the most lucrative concern 
on the list to be sold off. It is estimated to be worth US Dollars 1bn with 
annual profits of US Dollars 150m. But the government may be reluctant to 
lose such a valuable source of revenue and delay its privatisation. Last 
September Guatel, together with Northern Telecom of the US, inaugurated a 
modernisation project worth US Dollars 42m. An advanced switching system 
will be set up and a network of 40,000 telephone lines, 36,000 toll trunks 
and an international gateway exchange based on the latest technology will 
update Guatel's services. Meanwhile the US subsidiary Comcel, which operates 
a local cellular telephone monopoly, has given Motorola's Pan American 
Wireless Infrastructure Division a contract worth US Dollars 20m to 
introduce high-tech switching equipment. 

 Investment in infrastructure is vital, but with government spending at only 
6.3% of GDP in 1994, low even by Central American standards, there is little 
alternative but to rely on external financing. The Inter-American 
Development Bank recently approved a US Dollars 150m loan for road building, 
US Dollars 38.6m for healthcare improvements and US Dollars 4.3m to improve 
tax collection. The Japanese government has also pledged US Dollars 30m to 
modernise provincial infrastructure, and the Canadian government has 
promised to increase its contribution to the Fund for Democratic Development 
of Guatemala by US Dollars 3m.

 Foreign debt servicing soaks up about 4.8% of export earnings, well below 
the 10% figure regarded as 'manageable' by Eclac and better than the Latin 
American average of 16.4%.

 The May peace accords included a proposal to raise the tax to GDP ratio by 
50%, currently at 7.8%, one of the lowest rates in Latin America. But 
weighty political lobbying from the rich will render it a difficult task. 
According to the latest World Bank Report, 51% of the total population is 
outside the wage economy, and 37% of the urban population is in the informal 
sector, beyond the reach of tax collectors. In rural areas, the percentage 
of non-wage workers rises to 65%.

 Despite GDP growth, average living standards remain low and income 
distribution highly skewed. The country has achieved a sound base, including 
macro-economic and competitive exchange rate, for export-led growth, but 
without some levelling of income, through the broadening of the tax base, 
some social conflict could threaten progress after the URNG-government 
negotiaitions draw to a close.

 GUATEMALA: SOCIETY & POLITICS: DEATH SENTENCES PROVOKE PROTESTS: ARZU 
REFUSES TO PARDON MURDERERS OF FOUR-YEAR-OLD

 President Alvaro Arzu's determination to use the death penalty as a weapon 
against the crime wave that has swept Guatemala, in common with the rest of 
Central America, has provoked a wave of protests that threaten to overshadow 
the final achievement of a peace accord with the left-wing guerrillas -now 
scheduled for 15 September.

 Clemency refused. Two campesinos were still waiting in the death cell as we 
went to press, after a last-minute stay of execution. They had been due to 
face the firing squad in Escuintla on 23 July, after being found guilty of 
raping and murdering a four-year-old girl in April 1993. President Arzu 
refused to exercise his power of clemency, but the constitutional court 
accepted a motion from two lawyers that the judge who passed sentence had 
committed procedural errors.

 Guatemala is the only Central American country that still has the death 
penalty on its statute book. The executions of Pedro Castillo and Gustavo 
Giron would be the first to be carried out since 1983.

 Opposition to capital punishment has come internally from the Catholic 
hierarchy and human rights bodies such as the Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM), an 
organisation of relatives of disappeared people, and also from Amnesty 
International.

 GAM described the sentence as 'judicial terrorism,' and called on the 
government to attack the causes of violence in Guatemalan society, not the 
symptoms.

 Amnesty likened the death penalty to other human rights violations common 
in Guatemala, such as torture and disappearances. The organisation said four 
other death sentences had been passed in Guatemala, though appeals were 
still under way.

 Chief government negotiator Gustavo Porras announced a new round of talks 
with representatives of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca 
(URNG) before the end of the month. Their purpose, he said, would be to 
'clarify' some points about the strengthening of civil power and the role of 
the army in a democratic society.

 RIOS MONTT RE-ELECTED

 Retired General Efrain Rios Montt, prevented from standing for President 
again last year, showed his determination to remain in the political frame 
by being re-elected as general secretary of the opposition Frente 
Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG) on 21 July.

 Rios Montt made a show of accepting the accolade with reluctance. He bowed, 
he said, to the will of the party assembly. Losing presidential candidate 
Alfonso Portillo was chosen as one of the four assistant general 
secretaries, along with his former running mate, Harris Whitbeck.

 Rios Montt is now assured of control of the FRG for the next two years. The 
next presidential elections are in the year 2000, and in the meantime the 
General has the job of consolidating the FRG as the country's main 
opposition force.

 MEXICO: BRIEFS

 Mexico's stock exchange index fell 93 points to 2,916 in one day's trading 
on 15 July, wiping out all gains made this year. The 3.10% fall was seen as 
a knock-on effect from the Dow Jones fall on the same day's trading in New 
York.

 New capitalisation rules for financial intermediaries will come into force 
in September, including the allocation of greater resources to guarantee 
savers' funds against possible risks. The Mexican government also hopes that 
improved supervision of the banking sector will remove any remaining 
anomalies and provide a platform for investment-led economic reactivation.

 The Bank of Mexico has predicted a 33.9% rise in manufactured exports this 
year, driven by high investment in the sector.

 Only 0.9% of companies, the largest, generate 62% of the country's wealth, 
while the smallest 91.6% account for only 9.1% of the total, according to a 
report on the polarisation of Mexican industry.

 Sony is to invest US Dollars 9m in a factory in Tijuana which from next 
year will produce video recorders for distribution throughout the Americas.

 The steel maker Altos Hornos de Mexico announced net earnings of US Dollars 
318m in the first half of this year, three times higher than in the same 
period of 1995. This followed rises of 300% in exports and 30% in sales.

 Mexico's external trade surplus stood at US Dollars 3.93bn for the first 
half of the year, with a US Dollars 45.47m increase in exports, 18.4% up on 
the same period in 1995.

 Unemployment rose to 5.6% in June, a slight increase on the 5.4% figure for 
May.

 COLOMBIA: DRUGS & DIPLOMACY: SAMPER ANNOUNCES TOUGH LEGISLATION: BUT RETURN 
OF VICE-PRESIDENT COULD BRING CRISIS TO A HEAD

 By announcing a package of tough anti-drugs measures on 20 July, President 
Ernesto Samper both served notice that he would be unflinching in his 
determination to confront the traffickers who have all but wrecked his 
presidency and fulfilled one of Washington's most insistent demands. And by 
letting it be known that congress would be invited to modify the legislation 
that currently makes it impossible to extradite traffickers, he made another 
important conciliatory gesture to the United States.

 De la Calle returns. It could all be too late. Vice-President Humberto de 
la Calle, after conspicuously failing to give Samper his unreserved support 
against US pressures (see Page 326/96), finally resigned his post as 
ambassador in Madrid on 16 July and returned to Bogota to join in the 
political fray, or 'to collaborate more closely in the various and serious 
problems that afflict Colombia,' as he put it.

 He has been the focal point of innumerable scenarios and salidas for many 
months now -the latest came from former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen on 
21 July- and could again become the central figure in a negotiated accord 
that would enable Samper to step down gracefully. One option being discussed 
is that he, too, would step down from the line of succession, to enable a 
third party to serve out the remainder of Samper's term, which ends in 
August 1998.

 Names that have been mentioned include defence minister Juan Carlos 
Esguerra and former justice minister Nestor Humberto Martinez, both of whom 
are respected in Washington. But it seems highly unlikely that De la Calle 
would agree to such a procedure.

 The influential Liberal newspaper El Tiempo, after carefully sitting on the 
fence long after most politically-aware Colombians had taken sides, finally 
called upon Samper to resign, for the good of the country. 'This government 
is no longer viable,' said respected columnist Hernando Gomez on 16 June.

 And the industrialists' association, Andi, confirmed its support on 16 July 
for the strongly anti-Samper line taken by its president, Luis Carlos 
Villegas Echeverri.

 Since he took office in March, Villegas has been one of the loudest voices 
against the President within the Consejo Gremial Nacional -which feels that 
his remaining in power is doing serious damage to Colombia's economic 
prospects, particularly exports.

 Communications minister Juan Manuel Turbay, the most unconditional 
samperista of them all, has followed foreign minister Rodrigo Pardo out of 
the government. That leaves only the combative interior minister, Horacio 
Serpa Uribe, of the three ministers interrogated and acquitted by the 
supreme court, still standing by the President.

 Court cases continue. The supreme court has made clear that it will 
continue with its investigation of the 111 members of the lower house of 
congress who voted to clear Samper in April. Chief public prosecutor Alfonso 
Valdivieso said at the time that the representatives had failed to consider 
much of the concrete evidence against the President in their deliberations, 
and a complaint to that effect by a number of pressure groups has ensured 
that the matter will not be allowed to drop.

 The anti-drug measures are broadly speaking those promised by Samper in his 
speech after being cleared by congress (see Page 260/96), and can be seen as 
a survival strategy by the President. They followed the first steps to 
confiscate property belonging to imprisoned leaders of the Cali cartel, and 
declarations from Samper that he would press for the heaviest penalties for 
convicted traffickers.

 The proposal to debate the extradition of Colombian nationals -a marked 
change of tone from the defiance that characterised Samper's initial 
reactions to Washington's demand and to the withdrawal of his visa- was made 
conditional on the international community taking concerted action against 
drug-trafficking. This is a long-standing demand of Colombia and other South 
American countries, and serves to defuse the confrontation with the US by 
internationalising the issue.

 The departing foreign minister, Rodrigo Pardo, made a remark on 17 July 
very reminiscent of Valdivieso's comment that extradition could be a 'useful 
tool' for tackling the drug-trafficking problem.

 Successful pressure? This was a far cry from Samper's denunciation on 15 
July of Washington's 'unfriendly act' in withdrawing his visa, and its 'lack 
of respect for Colombia's democratic institutions.' The Clinton 
administration might be forgiven for concluding that its policy of incessant 
pressure on the Samper government is producing results, whatever the bluster 
from Bogota and the expressions of solidarity from around the world.

 The promised diplomatic offensive began on 23 July, when new foreign 
minister Maria Emma Mejia was dispatched to Washington. Samper himself said 
he would tour Latin America before addressing the United Nations general 
assembly in New York in September.

 MIRAFLORES EMERGENCY

 The government declared a special emergency zone in the department of 
Guaviare after Miraflores, San Jose del Guaviare and nearby towns were 
occupied by thousands of angry coca-growers, protesting at the government's 
eradication campaign, which uses aerial spraying of the herbicide 
glyphosate.

 This is the second such action in the region in the past year, and reflects 
both the effectiveness of the spraying operations, carried out by police 
helicopters, and the government's failure to offer small farmers any viable 
alternative way of making a living. The government blames Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc) guerrillas for organising the protests.

 ECUADOR: POLITICS: INDIAN CONFLICTS COMING TO A HEAD: ISSUES MAY PROVIDE 
EARLY TEST OF BUCARAM'S POLITICAL SKILLS

 The issue of the role that Indian organisations will have in the Bucaram 
government (see RA-96-06) looks like coming to a head sooner than expected. 
While jungle Indians are determined to resist plans for the further 
development of oil reserves in their territory -a declared priority of the 
incoming administration- highland communities are threatening an 'uprising' 
if the government fails to respond to their demands for assistance.

 The outgoing government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen has had to face a 
number of these levantamientos populares, generally organised by the 
Confederacion de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (Conaie) in connection 
with national issues, such as the privatisation of public utilities.

 Earthquake victims. But the latest threat has much more grass-roots 
origins: 80,000 campesinos from Cotopaxi province who lost everything in an 
earthquake in March claim the central government has given them no help with 
rebuilding their lives, despite lavish promises.

 Bucaram has fiercely attacked the 'racism' of previous governments, and 
promised a big say for Indian groups such as Conaie in his government -
including the creation of a full ministry of Indian affairs. Simmering 
Indian discontent, including roadblocks along the Pan-American highway, 
would be highly embarrassing for a leader anxious to establish his 
credentials both as a popular benefactor and as a man with whom foreign 
bankers and entrepreneurs can do business.

 The President-elect continued his efforts to reassure potential investors 
by confirming the president of the central bank, Augusto de la Torre, in his 
post on 19 July.

 De la Torre is regarded as a safe pair of hands by the private sector, and 
the best guarantee that the orthodox monetary policies of the present 
government will be continued under Bucaram. The latter has already been 
briefed by De la Torre on how to approach business leaders when he visits 
New York just before his 10 August inauguration.

 Oil development plans. Another of Bucaram's choices, Alfredo Adoum, as 
minister of energy, foreshadows an early conflict with jungle Indian 
organisations. Adoum, a Guayaquil businessman and old Bucaram ally, has 
already said he will 'open the doors wide' to foreign investment in the oil 
industry, particularly exploration. He is also committed to constructing new 
pipelines from the jungle to the coast.

 Such projects imply direct conflict with groups such as the Huaorani, only 
about 1,300 strong, who have been pressing the government to expel thousands 
of settlers who have moved into their territory in the Oriente jungles in 
the wake of the oil companies.

 The Huaorani have a legally-recognised 600,000-hectare reserve in Napo 
province, which has become a centre of oil production, involving foreign 
companies such as Oryx, Arco, Agip, Elf and Petrobras.

 The warlike Huaorani have threatened to seal off their territory and expel 
the oil companies and colonos themselves unless the government takes a hand. 
The Organizacion de Nacionalidades Huaoranis de la Amazonia Ecuatoriana 
(Onhae) has been claiming for some time that the companies have encroached 
on their territory without permission and have set one group of Indians 
against another with selective offers of economic aid and social services.

 A new, highly-recommended book* describes in detail the struggles of the 
Huaorani to come to terms with the encroachment of the outside world into 
their previosuly cloistered lives.

 CAPITALISATION PLEDGE

 Alvaro Noboa, economic adviser to Bucaram and one of the triumvirate of 
bankers who will run the economy (see Page 329/96), has promised to halt the 
privatisation programme initiated by the Duran-Ballen government and replace 
it with 'capitalisation' of state-owned companies, along the lines adopted 
by the Sanchez de Lozada government in Bolivia.

 TAX PROTESTS

 Thousands of small traders marched through the streets of the main cities 
on 17 July in protest against attempts by the government to extend the 
taxation system to the 'informal' sector of the economy. Invoices are now 
supposed to be issued for all sales above 10,000 sucres (about US Dollars 3) 
in value.

 The Guayas small traders' association threatened an all-out strike unless 
Bucaram reversed the measure by 20 August.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 ANTIGUA/ Nevis dispute. Prime Minister Lester Bird has brought in a former 
Commonwealth secretary-general and a university vice-chancellor to help find 
a solution to the political impasse between the Premier of Nevis, Vance 
Amory, and the St Kitts & Nevis Prime Minister, Dr Denzil Douglas. Amory has 
denounced the creation of an Office for Nevis Affairs on the smaller island 
by the Douglas administration, and has threatened to secede from St Kitts.

 BRAZIL/ Portuguese speakers. Portuguese, the third most widely spoken 
Western language, enjoyed linguistic communion on July 17, when Brazilian 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew to Lisbon to co-found the Community 
of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The founding act was attended by 5 
African countries as well as Brazil and Portugal, with the CPLP touted as a 
'model of north-south co-operation' between equals, despite the obvious 
population disparities: there are 160m Brazilians, but only 120,000 
inhabitants of Sao Tome-Principe.

 CHILE/ Miners' strike. The 1800 workers from the Lota coal mine, on strike 
since 17 May, have rejected for the fourth time an agreement reached between 
union leaders and the government. The strikers are demanding better benefits 
for the 450 who are to lose their jobs as part of a rationalisation 
programme. Meanwhile, development minister Felipe Sandoval hinted that the 
state coal company Enacar is to be partially privatised.

 COLOMBIA/ Bad weather. Some 600,000 people have been affected by the worst 
winter for five years. Torrential rainfall, already at nearly the yearly 
average of 3000mm after only six months, has destroyed 20,000 homes and 
100,000 hectares of crops, and claimed the lives of some 100 people. The 
Metereological Institute fears that the first rainy season, normally between 
mid-March and mid-June, is going to run into the second wet weather period, 
due to  begin in September.

 EL SALVADOR / Leftist meeting. Delegates from left wing parties from 
throughout the region were due to meet at the end of July in San Salvador 
for the 6th Congress of the Sao Paulo Forum, to be hosted by the FMLN. The 
Forum, founded in 1990 to promote political alternatives to neoliberalism, 
has also invited communist party members from China, Libya and Cuba, 
triggering heightened fears of subversion among El Salvador's security 
forces.

 To make matters a little more uneasy, only the previous week the 'Military 
Youth' organisation threatened to 'take control of the state' unless the 
government of President Armando Calderon Sol did not 'restore order', tackle 
social unrest, and investigating corruption charges against, amongst others, 
former president Alfredo Cristiani.

 GUYANA/ Floods. President Cheddi Jagan declared a State of National 
Emergency in mid-July after several months of some of the heaviest rainfall 
ever recorded in the country caused widespread flooding in coastal and 
riverside regions. All major rivers have burst their banks, affecting 30,000 
people and destroying swathes of rice crops, livestock and the Indian 
groups' staple, cassava. Army and police are supporting flood relief workers 
distributing food and medicine donated by the government and the 
international community.

 PERU/ Ratings slip. Public approval of President Alberto Fujimori's 
government fell to 56.3% in July, 3.5% less than in the previous month, 
according to an opinion poll by Analistas y Consultores. The number of those 
who disapprove of his record rose to 36%, six percentage points up on June.

 The ratings slip, however, came at the same time as Peru climbed two places 
on the UN's Human Development scale to 91st position, while UNICEF announced 
an US Dollars 8m health, education and nutrition programme for children.

 VENEZUELA/ Neighbour dispute. A new offensive in the war of words between 
Colombia and Venezuela over guerrilla activities in their common border 
region was launched in Caracas when the press reported a speech by President 
Ernesto Samper accusing corrupt elements of the Venezuelan army of selling 
arms to Colombian insurgents and drug-traffickers. The comments in fact came 
from a non-official report, according to Samper, who also released a veiled 
apology. But the duel has already soured Colombia's new foreign minister, 
Maria Mejia's imminent trip to Caracas to arrange a bilateral summit, the 
first since 1994.

 Minister sacked. President Rafael Caldera dismissed the justice minister, 
Enrique Meier, on 17 July, for his outspoken criticism of his predecessor, 
Rubens Creixems. Meier had only held the post since mid-March.

 REGION/ Oil Pact. Haiti and Panama are to rejoin the nine other Central 
American and Caribbean member states of the Venezuelan and Mexican Energy 
Co-operation Programme later this month. Under the scheme, quotas of oil and 
its derivatives are sold to the beneficiary nations with 20% of the cost 
returned as super-soft loans for development projects. Haiti and Panama had 
been suspended for overdue credit repayments.
