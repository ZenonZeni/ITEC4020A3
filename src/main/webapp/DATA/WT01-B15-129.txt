<h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<body><p>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today.  I
understand that the Committee intends to utilize S.1271, introduced by Senator Craig, as the
basis for its markup of a high-level waste bill.  Our administration is opposed to this legislation
for reasons I will elaborate on in this statement.
<p>
The primary emphasis in this bill, as in the similar measure that has been reported by the House
Commerce Committee, is to address the concerns of the institutions that are faced with extended
at-reactor storage of spent fuel from commercial power plants.  Their desire to provide for
removal of spent fuel from reactor sites is well understood.  By 2010, about 55 sites in 30 states
will require new spent nuclear fuel storage capacity for over 11,000 metric tons of uranium
(MTU).
<p>
There is a strong case against  leaving spent fuel at 73 sites in 34 states for several decades or
longer.  As power plants complete their licensed terms and go out of service, we will have
nuclear facilities operated for the sole purpose of spent fuel storage.  This scenario would be "de
facto" public policy to defer a decision on long-term management.  Certainly, no rational case
can be made that this is the preferred long-term management approach.
<p>
We are concerned, however, that the approach adopted in the proposed bill for resolving the
interim storage need is likely to raise new issues for equally important aspects of the national
nuclear waste system.  The bill as drafted assigns priority to an immediate initiative on interim
storage with a highly accelerated schedule.  This requirement coupled with the probable budget
constraints would place the repository program in jeopardy and reduce the policy commitment to
the long-term strategy of geologic disposal. 
<p>
Geologic disposal is the end-point of the federal radioactive waste management system.  A
decision to significantly defer or abandon it would have the effect of making at-reactor or interim
storage of commercial spent fuel the open-ended, long-term strategy.  If technical or institutional
considerations were to prevent supplemental storage, economic and efficient generating capacity
would be prematurely retired to the detriment of the ratepayers, the utility companies and the
national energy outlook.
<p>
Geologic disposal also underpins our efforts to clean-up the radioactive residue of decades of
nuclear weapons production.  The Department has more than 100 million gallons of high-level
radioactive waste that must be processed into tens of thousands of glass canisters requiring deep
geologic disposal.  Geologic disposal is the technical foundation for our international stance on
nuclear nonproliferation and our advocacy of limiting the international trade in weapons
materials.  Our endorsement of the international consensus on geologic disposal sets an example
for the high standards of environmental protection that we wish to promote worldwide.
<p>
Geologic disposal is also the strategy for the ultimate disposition of 65 MTU of spent fuel from
nuclear powered naval vessels, about 2,700 MTU of spent nuclear fuel owned by our
government, and 19 MTU of spent fuel of U.S. origin in foreign research reactors.  If we turn
away from this considered strategy and instead are left with a default strategy of perpetual
managed storage for defense wastes, our objective of encouraging the highest possible global
standards of nuclear safeguards and safety would be undercut.
<p>
Unless the importance of geologic disposal is reflected in the articulation of public policy and in
the funding of the program, we will need to rethink our options for the long-term custody of all
high-level nuclear waste.
<p>
<b>CONCERNS WITH S. 1271</b>
<p>
The objectives of S. 1271 are consistent with the long established Federal obligation to provide
for the long-term custody of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
Many of the provisions address issues that have arisen through prior efforts to meet this
obligation.  However, we are concerned that an emphasis on establishing an interim storage
facility in the vicinity of the Yucca Mountain site, and at an unreasonably rapid pace, will force
this program into excessively curtailed regulatory processes and unreasonable and logistically
untenable deadlines.  These provisions could also invite unnecessary public opposition to the
objectives of the program.
<p>
We are also concerned that, given the funding priorities for interim storage in S. 1271  and the
likelihood that funding will be constrained there will not be sufficient funding to maintain an
efficient schedule for the geologic disposal program.  The Yucca Mountain project is the only
process to determine if deep geologic disposal can attain public acceptance through an
independent regulatory process in the United States.  The results of that process are essential to
the credibility of the commitment we have made to weapons system cleanup and probably will
have important consequences for the options we are considering for the stabilization and
elimination of weapons grade materials as well. 
<p>
The bill's provisions mandate the immediate construction of a facility for the interim storage of
commercial spent fuel.  The facility is scheduled to begin operations in phases by January 1998,
at a designated location near the Yucca Mountain site.  The President has expressed his
opposition to the peremptory designation of Nevada as a site for an interim storage facility.  The
national policy, expressed in existing law, is that Nevada should be excluded from consideration
as an interim storage site.  The selection of any site for an interim storage facility deserves to be
based upon objective analysis using substantive criteria.  Furthermore, the relative merits of
selecting Nevada as an interim storage site would certainly be influenced by the probability that
the repository will also go forward.  That probability cannot be evaluated at this time. 
<p>
S. 1271 provides for the continuation of site characterization activities at Yucca Mountain, and
for the licensing and development of a repository if the site is found suitable.  In the event of
constrained funding, however, the licensing, construction, and operation of the repository are
designated to have a lower priority than the interim storage facility and its associated
transportation system.  Because the measure does not change the budgetary treatment of the
Nuclear Waste Fund collections, it seems likely that the funding for the repository determination
will be constrained as the requirements of an interim storage initiative increase.
<p>
<b>PROPOSED COURSE OF ACTION</b>
<p>
Our Administration continues to believe that completion of the scientific studies on Yucca
Mountain is the most sensible and principled course of action.  If Yucca Mountain is found
suitable and meets the test of licensing,  provision could have been made to take waste at the site
in a receiving facility as early as 2004.  The fiscal year 1996 budget submitted by the
Administration would have supported this approach.  However, funding constraints imposed by
the fiscal year 1996 appropriations appear to have foreclosed this schedule.
<p>
Faced with those realities, we suggest that the following principles be adopted in legislation. 
These principles will maintain momentum for permanent disposal, address the interim storage
issue, and recognize the realities of the budget outlook.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide adequate funding to resolve the major remaining technical uncertainties at
  Yucca Mountain.
<li>     Revise repository regulatory structure to reflect current circumstances.
<li>     Select any interim storage site based on objective criteria.
<li>     Initiate generic interim storage activities.
<li>     Protect environment, safety and health.
</ul>
<p>
First, we must fund a program at an adequate level so that an informed judgment can be made of
the viability of licensing and constructing a deep geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site. 
This judgment must include not only a scientific understanding of the geologic setting, but also
an engineering design that confirms that technologies are in hand that can carry out the design
concepts, and that the cost and capacity of the potential repository will make it a practical
undertaking.
<p>
Second, we must revise the regulatory structure that guides the licensing of the repository to
reflect the policy changes adopted since enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the realities
of the budgetary constraints on the program, and the experience of the past decade of work.  We
must eliminate unnecessary or duplicative requirements that make the cost of repository
characterization excessive.  In doing this, we will focus on the safety considerations of the
proposed project itself.
<p>
If the repository regulatory basis is updated to accommodate a more focused approach, and a
judgment is made in 1998 that the repository is a practical venture, a license application could be
submitted  to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 2006, which could result in emplacement
of waste in a repository beginning in 2015.  Our former targets for a license application in 2001
and emplacement in 2010 are nullified by the severe budget reductions in the FY 1996
appropriation.
<p>
Third, the selection of any site for an interim storage facility should be based upon the weighing
of objective criteria, including cost and social impacts; the technical evaluation of the risk to
public and worker health, safety, the environment; and the views of local stakeholders.  The
consideration of Nevada as a candidate site, or the determination of the need to consider other
candidate sites, should await the results of the 1998 viability assessment of the repository.
<p>
Fourth, consistent with the approach adopted by the Congress in FY 1996, the program should be
authorized and directed to initiate generic work toward early waste acceptance.  This work would
include requests for proposals for procurements to underwrite the investment necessary for the
private sector to develop the capability to carry out the transportation effort that will be required
for spent fuel removal from reactor sites nationwide.  It could also include the non site-specific
engineering work, such as the Topical Safety Analysis Report, needed to begin the licensing
process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Considerable progress could be made on
these two long lead time requirements in the period prior to the designation of an interim storage
site.
<p>
And most importantly, any legislation to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act must retain the
standards and procedures required to assure public and worker health and safety and
environmental protection.
<p>
<b>STATUS OF THE HIGH-LEVEL WASTE PROGRAM</b>
<p>
<b>Program Accomplishments</b>
<p>
The program accomplishments over the past year represent significant progress toward the
requirements of the proposal I have outlined.
<p>
In December 1994, we adopted a new program approach that was based on our own critical
examination of the civilian radioactive waste management program and on direction and
recommendations from the program's oversight, regulatory, and technical review organizations;
and feedback from concerned program stakeholders.  As an expression of support for the new
approach, the Congress agreed to a 40 percent increase in fiscal year 1995 funding to initiate it. 
Almost all of that increase was allocated to the Yucca Mountain Project.
<p>
Since that time we have made real, measurable progress towards geologic disposal.  We utilized
the entire increase, completing the fiscal year with very little carry-over and with
accomplishments that often exceeded our targets.  Our tunnel boring machine is two miles into
the Yucca Mountain site and well ahead of our planned schedules.  We recently completed the
turn into the proposed repository formation and have completed four scientific testing alcoves. 
These alcoves provide our scientists with direct access to the geologic features that must be
evaluated to determine the site's suitability for geologic disposal.
<p>
With adequate funding, we were scheduled in 1998 to make a determination of the suitability of
the Yucca Mountain site for geologic disposal and in 2001, if the site were found suitable, to
submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an authorization to
construct the repository.  Waste emplacement would have commenced in 2010.
<p>
<b>The FY 1996 Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act</b>
<p>
The FY 1996 appropriation for the civilian radioactive waste management program is far short of
what we had requested.  The Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act of 1996,
provides a total of $400 million for the program.  However, $85 million of the total appropriation
has been reserved to be used for an interim storage facility and would become available for
expenditure only upon enactment of new statutory authority.  Funds to implement the current
program are, therefore, effectively reduced to $315 million.  The consequence is a 50% cut in the
FY 1996 request for the program ($630 million) and a 40% reduction from the FY 1995 level of
expenditure ($522 million).  Based on Congressional guidance, we have allocated $250 million
of the available funds to preserve our core scientific work at the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
Prior to the recent appropriation action, we were on track to meet our major milestones,
culminating in emplacement of spent nuclear fuel in a repository by 2010.  That program
approach is no longer feasible.  The $315 million appropriation this year does not support the
program approach.
<p>
As directed by the Congress in the Conference report on the FY 1996 Energy and Water
Development Appropriation Act, we plan to address the major unresolved technical questions
regarding the conceptual design of the repository and its expected performance in a geologic
setting.  Consistent with the guidance, we have defined a new deliverable for the Yucca
Mountain Project which would take the form of a "Viability Assessment."  This package of
deliverables, included in a report to the Congress, would provide the requisite information for a
determination in the 1998-1999 time frame of the viability of continuing with the licensing of a
geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site.  This work will resolve the critical current
uncertainties.  With appropriate policy and funding support, we can regain a license application
target, but at a later date.
 <p>
<b>CONCLUDING REMARKS</b>
<p>
In closing, I urge you to consider our principles as you mark-up S. 1271.  My staff and I are
prepared to work with you as your deliberations proceed. 
<p>
I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.
