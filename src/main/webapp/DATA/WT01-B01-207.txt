<p><i>New Haven, CT, April 10 , 1996  -- </i>At the grand opening of the Endo-Laparoscopic Center at Yale University School of Medicine, 
Computer Motion, the world’s leading supplier of medical robots, demonstrated its prototype telesurgical robotic system, AESOP TS.  The 
company has been working closely with Dr. James C. Rosser, Director of Endo-Laparoscopic Surgery at Yale, in support of his research and 
education programs in telesurgery and robotically assisted laparoscopy.  The introduction of AESOP (pronounced “eesop”) at the training 
center marks a movement towards integrating robotics into mainstream surgical education curriculums.  The use of AESOP will make it easier 
for surgeons to learn advanced minimally invasive procedures by providing perfectly steady and controlled video images.  Using the AESOP 
technology in telementoring applications significantly changes the ability of the remote surgeon to participate in the procedure.<br>
</p>
<p>“We are honored to have the opportunity to contribute to the commitment that Yale University has made to educating our nation’s 
healthcare professionals in minimally invasive surgery,” said Gene Wang, CEO of Computer Motion.  “Our collaborative effort with Yale 
University to successfully integrate AESOP into the Endo-Laparoscopic Center demonstrates our commitment to educating the clinical 
community on the benefits that can be realized by using robotics in today’s healthcare environment.”<br>
<br>
<p>AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) is the first and only FDA cleared surgical robot.  
AESOP was first introduced in October 1994 and has been installed in over 100 hospitals and surgery centers around the world.  
This technology has also been used successfully in global telesurgical experiments.<br>
</p>
<p>“Robotic technology is at the heart of my research and educational vision. This technology is critical to the solo-surgery 
concept and enhances the surgeon’s abilities in the operating room,” said Dr. James C. Rosser, Associate Professor and Director 
of the Endo-Laparoscopic Center at Yale University School of Medicine.  “Clearly, the robot is fundamental to telementoring as 
it allows the remote surgeon to directly control the video image.  Our partnership with Computer Motion will allow us to bring 
robotics into the education system and demonstrate how it can be used effectively to reduce costs while improving the quality 
of care delivered to the patient.”<br>
</p>
<p>AESOP has successfully assisted over 13,000 minimally invasive surgical procedures allowing surgeons to perform procedures 
with fewer surgical assistants while at the same time improving outcomes.<br>
</p>
<p>“What I appreciate the most about AESOP is the steady picture,” said Dr. Robert W. Bailey, Division Head of General Surgery 
at Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Baltimore, MD.  “The robot provides me with a real advantage by giving direct control over 
the operative view, requiring fewer scope cleanings per procedure, improving procedural times and reducing overall operative costs.”<br>
</p>
<p>The company recently previewed AESOP 2000 with Voice Control {pending 510(k) market clearance} at the SAGES 1996 and 5th World 
Congress Meeting.  Computer Motion is currently developing new products which leverage the core technologies underlying the AESOP 
family of products.<br>
</p>
<p>“The ability to control AESOP using simple voice commands demonstrates how the surgeon can have direct control over not only the 
robot, but also the equipment in the operating theater which presently requires the assistance of another person,” said Dr. Carlos 
Gracia, Director of the California Laparoscopic Institute in San Ramon, CA.  “I can quite easily envision how allowing the surgeon 
to control the operating room environment using voice commands can provide significant benefits.”<br>
<p>Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics.  The company’s mission is to enhance surgeons’ capabilities
 and improve outcomes while reducing costs in the operating room using computers and robotics.  Computer Motion is privately held and 
is based in Goleta, CA. The company’s website is http://www.ComputerMotion.com.<br>
