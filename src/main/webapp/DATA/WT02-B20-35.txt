  This book on attention deficit disorders (ADD) is designed to prepare current  and
prospective teachers and other school personnel to teach and work with  students with
ADD in the schools.  Part 1 introduces the field; reviews  characteristics of ADD,
symptoms at different stages of life, and coexisting  conditions; offers a brief history of
the field; and discusses the role of  legislation.  Part 2 reviews assessment methods,
the diagnostic process, and  testing instruments; describes methods that regular
teachers can use in the  classroom; describes interventions used by special educators;
and discusses the  challenges faced by a parent of a child with ADD, methods of
counseling, and  home management for parents.  Part 3 reviews the kinds of
medications  administered to children with ADD; examines issues involved in using
medications; and focuses on the neurobiology that underlies ADD,  neurobiological
theories, and current research.  Appendices contain a  clarification of U.S.  Department
of Education policy to address the needs of  children with ADD, a list of support groups,
and a list of videotapes and  teaching and training materials.  Contains approximately

  This paper analyzes and synthesizes information on assessment of attention deficit
disorder (ADD), to provide guidance to states as they formulate  policies and practices.
The paper presents an overview of ADD from an  educational perspective, focusing on
student characteristics, developmental  patterns, and coexisting disorders.  Schoolwide
assessment of all students is  recommended, to screen for problems and to monitor
individual social and  academic progress.  This schoolwide assessment would be
followed by  modification of learning environments, and subsequent individual
evaluation of  only those students in need of additional assistance.  The paper identifies
the  best composition for a multidisciplinary assessment team, describes phases in  the
assessment process, and describes various strategies appropriate for  individual
student assessments in school settings.  Instruments used in the  assessment process
are provided, including the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire,  Skamp Rating Scale,
Home Situations Questionnaire-Revised, School Situations  Questionnaire-Revised,
and Academic Performance Rating Scale.  A brief paper by  Jeanne M. Kincaid titled
"Legal Considerations Pertaining to the Evaluation of  ADD/ADHD" and a paper by
Perry A. Zirkel titled "A Checklist for Determining  Legal Eligibility of ADD/ADHD
Students" are appended.  A list of parent support  groups and information centers
concludes the paper.  (Contains 26 references.)  (JDD)<br>   Descriptors: *Attention

  This report presents school-based interventions that teachers can employ in  regular
classrooms to educate students with attention deficit disorders (ADD).   The report
attempts to compensate for the limitations in the ADD research  literature by
extrapolating from research on other difficult-to-teach students  to identify and describe
academic and social skills interventions that are  likely to be effective in regular
classrooms with students who have ADD.  The  first chapter provides an overview of
the interventions and explains procedures  followed in selecting the interventions.  Each
of the remaining eight chapters  focuses on a single intervention program.  These
include: (1) classwide peer  tutoring, (2) early literacy program, (3) "Tribes," (4)
self-regulated strategy  development in writing, (5) earth science videodisc program, (6)
skills for  school success, (7) aggression replacement training, and (8) life-centered
career education.  Each of the eight chapters provides a description of the
intervention's purpose, its content and activities, implementation  requirements, impact
on teachers, significant costs, testimonials of  effectiveness, limitations, research
support, contact point for more  information, and a list of references.  To a large extent,
the program  developers, as well as the teachers and administrators who are using the
programs successfully, describe the interventions in their own words.  (JDD) <br>

  This paper provides guidelines on how to identify and work with students with
attention deficit disorder (ADD).  It begins by outlining common symptoms of  ADD in
the classroom and general principles for the incorporation of medication  into school life.
The paper presents features of schools successful in dealing  with ADD.  School-wide
suggestions emphasize individualizing classroom and  lesson planning, using
cooperative learning, pairing ADD students with non-ADD  peers, and using checklists
to formalize communication between the school and  the home.  Further suggestions
provide for serving the student with ADD within  the classroom context and as an
individual learner.  Principles of behavior  management effective in working with
students with ADD are also presented.  (PB)<br>

disorder (ADD).  Diagnosis, prevention, prevalence, behavior control, medication, and
mainstreaming issues are briefly addressed, in discussions of  such myths as "ADD can
be prevented," "medication can cure students with ADD,"  and "students with ADD
cannot learn in the regular classroom." The long-term prognosis for children with ADD is
also explored.  (PB)<br>

  This briefing paper is intended to improve understanding of attention/deficit
hyperactivity disorder (Ad/HD)--what it is, what to look for, and what to do.  Three
subtypes are identified: (1) the predominantly combined type; (2) the  predominantly
inattentive type; and (3) the predominantly hyperactive/impulsive  type.  Causes and
incidence of ADHD are briefly addressed.  Signs of ADHD are  discussed, including
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.  Essential  diagnostic features of the
syndrome based on the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
edition) are listed, and components and sources  of a professional diagnostic evaluation
for ADHD are explained.  The discussion  of ADHD treatment addresses: effects of
improved understanding of ADHD,  behavior management, medication, and educational
intervention.  Provision of  special educational services is also considered and basic
guidelines for  educational intervention are listed.  Parents are given suggestions on
what to  do if their child is found ineligible for services, how to help their child  improve
his/her self-esteem, and how to find parent support groups.  (Contains  7 references, a
listing of 21 readings and resources, a listing of 2 policy  clarifications of the Department
of Education on ADHD, and a list of 6  organizations.) (DB)<br>   Descriptors: *Attention
