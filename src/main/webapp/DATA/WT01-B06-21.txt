         Inc. web site! SMI has been assisting couples and
         individuals since 1984. We are one of a select few
         programs in the country that has never had a woman change
         her mind, and one of only three programs which is run by an
         attorney. We have been a member of the Better Business
         Bureau since 1986, with no complaints filed against us. We
         have had the pleasure of assisting couples from across the
         world in creating families. Our surrogate program is a full
         service agency, coordinating all medical, travel, and legal
         procedures. It is the only recognized surrogacy program in
         the world which also openly works with gay and lesbian
         couples/individuals. As of the writing of this home page, we
         have had nearly 90 babies born. We have another 50 couples
         from across the world who have selected surrogates and are
         expecting, or hoping to be expecting soon. We also have
         another 50 women available to be surrogates.<HR WIDTH="90%">
