Global Cooperation on Climate Change:  Experts Recommend Paths to
Effective Action

     This year will mark the beginning of formal negotiations
toward an international framework convention on climate change.
Protocols to add specific and binding targets will follow, or may
even accompany the convention.  What lessons can we learn from
previous agreements?  What obstacles will negotiators face?  Is a
global agreement likely to be effective, or could regional
agreements and unilateral actions be stronger in the short term?
To help answer these questions, GECR spoke with some of the
leading figures in the current drive to define the elements of a
convention on climate change.
     The 1985 Vienna Convention on Protection of the Ozone Layer,
and the subsequent Montreal Protocol, are widely seen as models
for future global environmental agreements.  The Vienna
Convention (which itself was partially modeled after the 1977
Barcelona Convention) was established as an interim agreement
when it became apparent that a specific protocol would not yet
have wide support; however it was a definite, formal statement of
commitment by governments to future action on the ozone depletion
problem.  The Montreal Protocol, signed two years later, added
legally binding deadlines for the reduction of ozone-depleting
chemicals.
     This two-step process (convention followed by protocol) was
necessary for the ozone treaty, but should the same procedure be
followed for a climate change agreement?  Why not aim for an
accord that includes protocols, particularly one on CO2?  "I
think that will delay it," says Ambassador Richard Benedick, the
chief US negotiator of the Montreal Protocol, now on detail from
the US State Department as senior fellow of the Conservation
Foundation/World Wildlife Fund in Washington, DC. "People aren't
ready for a protocol [on CO2], and I think you have to go through
a process to get there.  I believe in partial solutions -- in
fact, the Montreal Protocol is already a partial solution for
climate change -- and we ought to disaggregate rather than
complexify.  The framework convention could have some teeth, but
we shouldn't try to cram it up with too much.  It will load down
the convention, and we'll never finish it.  I'd rather go step by
step."
     A framework convention will be difficult enough to negotiate
(the current goal is to have a convention ready for signature at
the UN's Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992),
but producing the relevant protocols could prove an even greater
challenge.  As Benedick points out, we already have one
greenhouse gas treaty in the Montreal Protocol, but creating an
agreement that can reduce carbon dioxide worldwide while still
serving the short- and long-term interests of developed and
developing countries will test the limits of the parties'
diplomacy, cooperation, and patience.  Carbon dioxide carries far
more economic and political weight than CFCs ever could.
     Some observers are concerned that a truly effective
international agreement to limit carbon dioxide emissions won't
be signed by more than a handful of countries.  According to
Michael Grubb of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
London, UK, a treaty with any given reduction target would prove
relatively easy for parties like the US and the USSR to comply
with:  neither currently uses energy efficiently, and they have
many options available to reduce emissions.  But Japan or France,
which are already quite energy-efficient in terms of CO2
emissions, might argue against such "equal reduction" targets
because it would be unfairly expensive for them to take emissions
down another percentage.  Thus, any agreement based on equal
reductions could result in a "lowest common denominator"
compromise, which may not be strong enough to address the problem
of global emissions.  Richard Benedick says this becomes less of
a problem if the treaty establishes a retroactive baseline year
for emission levels back to the mid-eighties, for example, so
countries can credit their existing energy-efficiency policies
toward the targeted levels.  Still, setting that baseline year
could be problematic:  Japan began major measures to reduce
emissions in the 1970s.  Do we want to go back that far?
     This example merely hints at the complexity of establishing
targets that a majority of countries will accept.  And once goals
are established, ways to achieve and enforce them must still be
settled.  A number of agencies, groups, and individuals are
currently analyzing carbon taxes (domestic and international),
leasable or tradeable emission permits, and other regulatory or
incentive options, to see which ones might be most effective and
politically feasible.
     The idea of a Law of the Atmosphere is gaining some support,
although as Peter Faross of the European Commission headquarters
in Brussels explained to GECR, "a lot of countries are very
sensitive when you try to touch on their sovereignty rights.  And
the broad and ambitious approach of a full-fledged law for the
atmosphere might be a very time-consuming process.  You may
arrive at the point where it's too late to implement the
necessary action because the discussions would last too long."
The unsigned Law of the Sea stands in testimony to the political
unpopularity of international control systems.
     Peter Thacher, former deputy executive director of the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and assistant
secretary general of the UN, who now works with the World
Resources Institute in Washington, DC, says that the appropriate
way toward international cooperation on the global warming issue
is through a comprehensive action plan, much like the "Action
Plan to Protect Stratospheric Ozone" that UNEP developed for
governments in 1977.  An action plan for climate change would
contain a legal chapter, calling for negotiation and early
adoption of a framework convention and the first of several
protocols to deal with individual greenhouse gases, such as CO2.
The plan would also have a scientific chapter to implement --
with heavy involvement of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Program -- the intensified research and monitoring that is needed
to help bring other greenhouse gases under international control.
This calls for an additional chapter to ensure that international
mechanisms and funding are adequate to mount a stronger global
research effort.  "These funds are needed today," Thacher says,
"and should not be delayed until treaties are ready."
     Thacher acknowledges that negotiating international
conventions and protocols could take time.  What about other
actions in the meantime?  "I think the `big boys' ought to tackle
this on their own, unilaterally taking steps in their own
self-interest," Thacher told GECR.  The industrialized nations
have their own organs, such as the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), to do this if they want to
avoid using the UN.  "They can all benefit by looking at policy
implications of improving energy efficiency.  I think that ought
to get started without waiting for a package deal in which the
developed countries are involved.  They ought to get started
because that's where the big CO2 cutbacks can be achieved in the
shortest time."
     Michael Grubb takes a similar view: "You have to ask
seriously whether you really need to get all countries involved
at this stage, and you may well conclude that you can do more
with less:  70% of global carbon emissions are produced by the
US, Europe (East and West), and the USSR, so you may get
something useful from a more limited number of countries."  Grubb
stresses that global participation is ultimately necessary, but
notes that unilateral, bilateral, and regional efforts could be
important stepping stones on the way toward that goal.
     Conversations with sources at the OECD and the European
Commission indicate that neither body expects to develop
agreements among its members apart from the UN's global treaties,
but both are working on climate change issues on their own and
through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The OECD will hold a meeting in late January among its member
countries to discuss the questions they will need to consider
when they develop climate change policies.  The discussions
should help OECD countries work out some of their differences in
order to facilitate the formal IPCC negotiations.  The
International Energy Agency (IEA) and the OECD are collaborating
on an energy and greenhouse gas "outlook" up to the year 2005,
which will provide the basis for evaluation in 1990 of the
potential for and costs of specific sectoral actions to reduce
emissions.  And the European Commission is creating a coherent
energy saving program called SAFE, which it expects to release
this year.
     The IPCC will present the elements of a framework convention
at the Second World Climate Conference (29 October - 7 November
1990); formal negotiations will begin then or shortly thereafter.
Cooperation will be hard-won, but essential.  In his 1968 essay,
"The Tragedy of the Commons," Garrett Hardin wrote that "we are
locked into a system of `fouling our own nest,' so long as we
behave only as independent, rational, free-enterprisers." If we
knowingly choose not to abandon free enterprise and rationality,
then to avoid the tragedy of the global commons we must
compromise some of our independence.  Global solutions will take
time and will be imperfect, but in the end, it seems they'll be
the ones that matter.

United Nations Confirms 1992 World Conference on Environment

     In late December, the 44th session of the United Nations
General Assembly formally approved a proposal to go forward with
the long-planned World Conference on Environment and Development
to be held in Brazil in 1992.  The conference, which will be the
second UN-sponsored world meeting on the environment (the first
was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972), is expected to last two
weeks, and will be timed to coincide with World Environment Day
(5 June, 1992).  An open-ended preparatory committee, based in
the UN General Assembly, will meet five times to plan the
conference, with the first meeting planned for March 1990 in New
York.  The committee will hold its subsequent meetings in Geneva
and Nairobi, with a final meeting in New York to solidify plans.
     During the UN session, developed and developing countries
had to negotiate the locations of the planning meetings, as well
as which body of the UN would be responsible for planning the
conference.  Industrialized countries originally favored the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as the appropriate
planning group, with meetings to occur in Geneva.  Developing
countries objected to this choice on the grounds that they are
not well represented in Geneva, and they felt that their needs
would be better served by a planning committee drawn from the
General Assembly.

CFC Taxes Now in Effect in US

     As of 1 January 1990, US producers and importers of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) must pay a base tax of $1.37 per pound
of chemical, with adjustments according to the particular
chemical's ozone depleting potential.  Importers of products
manufactured with the use of CFCs (such as automobiles,
electronic equipment, refrigerators, etc.) are subject to the
tax, which will be passed on to consumers.  The tax was
originally sponsored by Representative Peter Stark (Democrat,
California), and was incorporated in the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989.  The Internal Revenue Service
released initial guidelines on 22 December; final regulations
have not yet been issued.
     The base tax will rise incrementally, with an increase to
$1.67 per pound in 1992, jumping to $2.65 per pound the following
year.  From 1995 on, the rate will increase by $.45 annually.
Halons, recycled CFCs, CFCs used for manufacturing rigid foam
insulation, and CFCs used as feedstocks (i.e., entirely consumed
in the process of producing another chemical) are not currently
covered by the law.  Manufacturers of CFCs and halons for export
are exempt unless they surpass their current level of exports, in
which case they must either pay the tax or apply to the
Environmental Protection Agency for new allowances.  Halon and
rigid foam manufacturers will pay the full tax beginning in 1994,
but are required to pay a reduced base rate ($.25/pound) from
1991 until then.  US companies can still produce ozone-depleting
chemicals outside the US without paying the tax, so long as the
chemicals are not imported into the US.
     Floor stocks are covered by the tax in cases where inventory
is being held for sale or for use in further manufacture.
Companies (defined by employer identification number) that hold
total floor stocks of less than 400 pounds are exempt from this
tax.  The GECR Document Service will provide all relevant
documents (legislation, IRS guidance, a list of products subject
to the tax, etc.).  Call the GECR Hotline for more information,
at TEL: +1-617-648-8700.

China Releases Results of Afforestation Programs

     China has planted enough trees in its northern provinces
over the past 12 years to increase forest cover by over 25
million hectares (250,000 square kilometers), according to a
Chinese official news agency report released 5 December 1989.
The country began the afforestation program in 1977 to "harmonize
the development of agriculture, forests, and animal by-products,
and to control sand expansion."  Grain production in areas now
protected by trees has risen 10% - 30%, and grassland in the
region has increased by 20%.
     According to the report, 16.5 million hectares (165,000
square kilometers) of forest were planted by airplane, with the
rest planted manually.  The report states that total forest
coverage in the 13 northern provinces has increased to slightly
more than 7%, up from 5% in 1977.  China plans to spend "several
decades" constructing additional forest protection systems in the
region.
     Because the figures for the total afforested area seem high,
GECR checked Chinese-English translation of the figures with
several sources, but we were not able to get independent
confirmation of the areas from China.  According to World
Resources 1988-89, published by the World Resources Institute in
Washington, DC, "China has the world's largest reforestation
program, planting new forests at the rate of more than 4.5
million hectares per year."

Mexico City Improves Air Quality by Restricting Driving

     The government of Mexico City, in response to public concern
about winter air pollution levels, has implemented a program to
restrict driving in the Mexican capital from 20 November 1989
through 28 February 1990.  According to Ramon Ojeda, the city's
director of prevention and control of contamination, "each car in
the metropolitan area has to be idle one day a week from Monday
through Friday."
     Stickers, coded with a color specific to the day that a car
is not allowed on the road, have been affixed to license plates
on all city-registered vehicles (automobiles and
non-passenger-carrying trucks).  Cars from outside the city are
restricted based on the last digit of their plate number.
Weekends are unrestricted, as is the period from 10 pm to 5 am
every night.  Taxis and buses are not included in the program.
     According to Ojeda, Mexico City has 2,300,000 vehicles
registered, and the program has decreased the number of vehicles
on the road by over 400,000 per day.  Vehicles caught driving on
their restricted day are impounded and held for 24 hours.  Owners
must pay a fine equivalent to one month's minimum wage salary
(currently 380,000 pesos, or US $125.00) to recover their cars.
Since the program began, the city has issued 7,000 fines, which
Ojeda sees as a relatively low figure, and a sign that most
people are obeying the rules.  "The public has supported the
program enthusiastically, and there weren't any complaints,"
Ojeda told GECR.  "To the contrary, they want it to continue all
year."  The city's public transportation system seems to be
little affected by the program, since most people are electing to
car-pool.  Ojeda is enthusiastic about the program, saying that
"now the skies are clearer:  you can see the volcanoes."

Cairo Conference Sets New Tone of Cooperation Among Countries

     The World Conference on Preparing for Climate Change, held
in Cairo, Egypt from 17 - 21 December, 1989, set a new tone for
global cooperation, according to John Topping, president of the
Climate Institute in Washington, DC.  The conference was convened
by the Climate Institute, the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), and the government of Egypt, and was
co-sponsored by 20 international agencies and organizations.
     Conference participants released the "Cairo Compact," a
proclamation toward a concerted world-wide response to the
climate crisis, which recognizes among other things the
responsibility of all countries, including developing nations, to
take measures in their own self-interest to reduce emissions.
     This was the first major world conference on climate change
to be held in a developing country, and Topping told GECR that a
distinguishing feature of this conference was the strong sense of
cooperation and common purpose -- and a relative lack of the
"North-South" tensions that have tended to plague such meetings
in the past.  "The Egyptians set the tone, which allowed it to be
successful in creating a sense of global commitment," Topping
told GECR.  The proclamation was initially endorsed by developing
countries as well as the industrialized nations.
     The conference focused strongly on adaptive measures, "not
because emission control isn't critically important -- it is, and
we're obviously very concerned about it -- but the problem is
that a lot of the developing countries will be affected even under a
stringent emissions control scenario."  Topping says that the
conference helped underscore industrialized nations' concern for
the safety and welfare of people in developing countries, not
just concern about their emissions.

Scientists Lower Estimates of Potential Sea Level Rise

     Predictions of sea level rise of up to 1.5 meters by the
year 2100 are probably overestimates, according to studies
presented at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union
(AGU).  Over 4,000 scientists met in San Francisco, California,
USA, on 4 - 8 December 1989 to discuss a wide variety of topics,
including global warming and sea level rise.
     Thirty years of observations of the Antarctic ice sheet have
led Charles R. Bentley, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
Wisconsin, USA, to conclude that the polar ice cap may actually
be removing water from the sea, accounting for a sea level drop
of 5 mm per year.  Bentley believes that the short-term response
to global warming is increased snowfall over Antarctica as
warming air takes up and holds more water.  This snow
accumulation would outpace any melting of the ice sheet,
according to Bentley.  Bentley stresses the importance of viewing
the Antarctic ice sheet as a dynamic system that responds to
climate changes over long periods of time.
     Satellite observations by H. Jay Zwally of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight
Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA, show that the Greenland ice
sheet is thickening as a result of increased precipitation, and
Zwally suggests that the thickening will continue.  Research
conducted by Tad Pfeffer, Mark Meier, and Tissa Illangasekare, of
the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA, indicates
that meltwater runoff from arctic glaciers may take a significant
amount of time to reach the ocean as it refreezes while filling
in snowpack pores as deep as 50 meters.
     According to Meier, by the year 2050 -- the time atmospheric
CO2 is projected to double -- melting of small glaciers may have
contributed about 0.15 meters to sea level rise, thermal
expansion may contribute a 0.2 meter rise, and human factors
(such as pumping groundwater into the oceans) may contribute
another 0.2 meter rise.  Greenland would contribute a 0.08 meter
fall in sea level, and Antarctica would lower levels by an
additional 0.31 meter.  Meier cautioned that the picture is still
quite uncertain, but that "it's beginning to look now as if sea
rise will lag behind warming by a significant amount."

Researcher Documents Acid Precipitation's Effect on Spruce
Seedlings

     Acidic clouds that envelope high-elevation forests for up to
35% of the year in the eastern US can cause more severe damage to
trees than acid rain does, according to Jay Jacobson of the Boyce
Thompson Institute of Plant Research at Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, USA.  The acid clouds have a pH of 3.5, several
times more acidic than acid rain, which has an average pH of 4.
The rising and lowering of the clouds over mountaintops causes
the acid measured on tree leaves to become concentrated to pH
levels as low as 2 as the water evaporates, Jacobson told GECR.
Jacobson studied the effects of acidified water vapor on red
spruce (Pinea rubens) seedlings, a species that dominates many
eastern US mountaintop forests.
     In greenhouse and field studies, Jacobson determined that
the effects of acidic mist depended on the relative
concentrations of sulfuric and nitric acid.  Acid precipitation
generally has a higher concentration of sulfuric acid than nitric
acid, along with small amounts of ammonium ions.  Sulfuric acid
alone was more damaging to needles by causing localized death of
plant tissue and premature loss of needles from the seedlings.
Nitric acid mist appeared to influence nutrient relationships by
increasing nitrogen levels and decreasing levels of calcium and
magnesium in the leaves.  However, sulfuric acid mist affected
the spruce needles at lower concentrations than did nitric acid,
Jacobson told GECR.
     Jacobson's research is part of the five-year federally
funded National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which
involved more than 700 scientists and a half billion dollars in
research money.  Funding expires this year; Jacobson told GECR
that some of the work is unfinished and inconclusive, but he says
it is unlikely that federal funding for the program will be
renewed.

Antarctic Ozone Hole Broke Up Earlier Than Expected in 1989

     The 1989 Antarctic ozone hole got off to an earlier and
stronger start than the 1987 hole, but it started to break up a
month earlier than expected, according to Mark Schoeberl of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.  "The polar
vortex in 1989 began to break up in mid-to-late October; in 1987,
it held intact all the way through November," Schoeberl told
GECR.  The total amount of ozone "ended up going down to almost
exactly the same level as or perhaps slightly higher (by about 10
Dobson Units) than 1987."
     The breakup of the ozone hole is controlled by two major
factors, Schoeberl explained: one is the intrinsic resistance to
breakup of the ozone hole caused by the ozone reduction itself,
and the other is the nature of the forces that tend to break up
the polar vortices.  These forces are extremely variable from
year to year and are unpredictable.  A more active dynamical
stratosphere that would tend to break up the hole or prevent its
formation "generally goes with the QBO (the Quasi-Biennial
Oscillation, a switching of tropical winds from east to west that
occurs approximately every 27 months)," Schoeberl told GECR, "but
this year was an exception."  Normally, with an easterly QBO, the
ozone hole is not as deep, as was the case in 1988.  Tropical
winds were still easterly in 1989, but "the link was broken
between the QBO and the zonality of the flow."  The vortex flow
tended to follow east-west latitude lines in 1989, keeping the
polar stratosphere quiet enough to cause ozone depletion nearly
as great as in 1987's record-setting hole.  "Then we had a big
dynamical event in October and the hole started to break up."
When the polar vortex is disrupted, undepleted air comes into the
system and ozone levels begin to rise.

Tree-Ring Research Used in Study of Climate Change

     Scientists in the US, USSR, China, Argentina, New Zealand,
Canada, India, Australia, and Europe are studying the rings of
long-lived trees for clues to historic and prehistoric climate
change.  Certain species of trees can accurately indicate periods
of drought and temperature fluctuations, and may be used to
reconstruct past climate events and trends.
     Malcolm Hughes, Director of the University of Arizona's
Laboratory of Tree Ring Research in Tucson, Arizona, USA, is
studying the rings of giant sequoias as a potential climate
record.  The trees can grow to at least 2,600 years old, and they
show "a good drought signal," with extremely narrow rings in dry
years.  Sequoias can thus show the frequency of severe droughts
in the region surrounding the trees.
     Researchers have to select carefully the tree species and
the individuals sampled to ensure that the growth ring response
can be correlated to the parameter being studied.  "A bristlecone
pine at a high elevation has a different response than one at
lower elevations," David Meko of the Laboratory of Tree Ring
Research points out.  Long-lived trees are often few and far
between, and getting good spacial coverage of a particular
species can be a problem.  The tree ring record must be
calibrated with known instrumental records in order to be used
with confidence, which can prove difficult if records are scarce
for the parameter (soil temperature, rainfall, etc.) being
measured.
     Gordon Jacoby, of the Tree Ring Laboratory at Lamont-Doherty
Laboratory in New York, USA, says that his group has recently
reconstructed  northern hemisphere temperatures for a 300-year
period using tree rings, and the reconstruction shows a warming
trend within the last hundred years "that is unusual in the
context of the 300 year record."  Jacoby was able to sample many
individuals of the same species (white spruce) over almost 90
degrees of longitude.  "We covered about 25% of the circumpolar
area in a fairly homogeneous data set."  White spruce is limited
by thermal properties such as air temperature, ground
temperature, and soil temperature, and is moisture-stressed when
the active zone above the permafrost is extremely cold, reducing
the tree's ability to take up water.

Energy-Efficient Lights are Selling, But Producers Face
Challenges

     The market for compact fluorescent lamps, which have typical
life spans of 8,000 to 10,000 hours and can save users 75% or
more of the costs associated with standard incandescent bulbs, is
"growing at about 25% per annum," according to Vivienne Charrett
of Thorn Lighting in Enfield, UK.  Much of that growth can be
attributed to incentive programs by electric utilities, such as
rebate offers, options to lease rather than purchase expensive
light bulbs, and giveaways.  Carol O'Neill of Philips Lighting
Company's US division in Somerset, New Jersey, told GECR that
growth in sales can also be attributed to media attention,
efforts by environmental groups, and general concern about global
warming.  Still, O'Neill says that compact fluorescents, while
"experiencing explosive growth," represent a minute percentage of
overall lighting sales.
     Producers face a number of obstacles in their effort to
bring compact fluoresents to a wider market.  Amory Lovins,
director of research at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Old
Snowmass, Colorado, USA, says that "we need to decouple
utilities' profits from their sales so they will no longer be
rewarded for selling more electricity, nor penalized for selling
less.  And when they do something smart to cut your bill, they
need to be allowed to keep part of the savings as extra profit."

     Other concerns, according to Lovins, include a lack of
properly trained installation technicians, the fact that no one
currently provides retrofit components in bundled packaging,
limited competition in certain areas (central Europe, Australia,
New Zealand) that allows manufacturers to sell at excessive
markups, and the need for more imaginative marketing.  "I haven't
yet seen any compact fluorescent manufacturer go for the green
market by pointing out that each lamp takes a ton of CO2 out of
the air over its life [when compared with other lamps]," Lovins
told GECR.
     Energy-efficient lamps appear to be selling better overall
in Europe and the UK than the US.  Vivienne Charrett of Thorn
claims this is due to the cost of energy: "The country with the
least penetration of compact fluorescents is France, where the
cost of energy is exceptionally low."  Fred Steinmeyer of Osram
in Munich, West Germany agrees, saying that Europe recognized the
need to save energy earlier than the US.  Dick Dowhan of GTE
confirms that the difference could be attributed to Europe's
early start on the market, but he also cited Europe's 220-volt
system as a reason:  customers don't notice as much of a
difference between incandescents and compact fluorescents as
Americans do.  Amory Lovins says, "I don't think it has much to
do with electricity price.  I think it's a function of utility
participation, and least-cost-planning or an equivalent process."

UK Residential Investment in Energy-Saving Equipment Drops 12% in
1989

     The British government's scrapping of numerous
energy-efficiency programs in the past two years has directly
affected domestic purchases of energy-saving  equipment,
according to Andrew Warren of the London-based Association for
the Conservation of Energy (ACE).  Using sales figures from
relevant trade associations, ACE found that residential
investment in energy-saving products dropped significantly in
1989, down 12% from already declining 1988 levels.
     Purchases of weatherstripping (draft proofing) were down
15%; double-glazed windows dropped nearly 20%; and economical
heating equipment (energy-efficient boilers, thermostatic
radiator valves, etc.) declined by 6%, with Warren forecasting a
12% drop.
     Warren points out that the cutting of incentives and
education programs for energy efficiency directly conflicts with
UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's stated commitment to fight
global warming.  "The policies are going in the wrong direction,"
Warren told GECR, "and Thatcher's own government's submission to
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that if
present trends in the UK continue, we will see CO2 emissions
leaping.  We're currently at 579.3 billion tons a year; we're
likely to see rises of 29% - 34% across the next 15 years, and up
to 48% - 58% in 30 years."

General Motors Displays Advanced Electric Car

     General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automobile
manufacturer, has unveiled a sophisticated electric car that can
accelerate from 0 - 60 miles per hour (0 - 96 km/h) in eight
seconds, and can run for 120 miles (192 km) at highway speeds
without charging the batteries.  Recharging can be accomplished
in several hours by plugging into a conventional wall socket.
The prototype vehicle, called the "Impact," could be on the
market by the mid-1990s, but several problems must first be
overcome:  operating costs of the vehicle are currently about
twice those for gasoline-powered cars because the entire battery
pack must be replaced (at a cost of US $1,500) every 20,000 miles
(32,000 km).  The company has also not yet tested the vehicle's
crash-worthiness.
     Spokesmen for General Motors claim that given adequate
demand, the purchase price of the sporty-looking car would be
similar to gasoline-powered vehicles in its class.  The company
hopes to improve the life of the battery pack to bring operating
costs down to those of conventional cars.  If the vehicle is
exported from the US to countries where fuel prices are taxed, or
if US fuel prices rose, the "Impact" could prove to be less
expensive to operate than gasoline-powered models.
     Electric cars are a mixed answer to threats of global
warming:  while they do not burn fossil fuels themselves, the
vehicles generally use utility-generated electric power to
recharge.  Still, a recent report prepared by the University of
California at Berkeley, California, USA, suggests that an
all-electric vehicle fleet could reduce CO2 emissions by up to
43%, depending on the mix of energy sources used by utilities and
the efficiency of the vehicles themselves.  Other alternatives
exist:  Solar powered cars are already in use in Europe, and a
number of companies and independent groups are developing
versions for the US market.  GECR will report on these and other
alternative-fueled vehicles (such as hydrogen-powered cars) in
future issues.

Carrier Introduces CFC Recycling Unit for Large Chillers

     Carrier Corp. of Syracuse, New York, USA, has developed a
refrigerant recovery and recycling system specifically designed
to handle large-scale commercial chillers.  The company will sell
the equipment, called the Refrigeration Management System (RMS),
worldwide to building owners when they purchase new centrifugal
chillers from Carrier, and to owners of existing commercial
air-conditioning units.
     The RMS units come in two sizes:  one will handle 1,600
pounds (720 kg) of CFCs and the larger unit has a capacity of
3,300 pounds (1485 kg).  Carrier spokesmen advise that the price
range for the equipment will be from US $6,000 - $12,000.  The
recycling unit draws a vacuum of 25 inches (62 cm).  For more
information, contact Rick Whitmyre at Carrier Corp., TEL:

US EPA Proposes New Controls on Municipal Waste Incinerators

     On 30 November, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposed new controls on municipal waste incinerators that would
trap five times more dusty particulates than currently required,
along with 90 to 95% of sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid, and
97% to 99% of airborne metals, such as lead and mercury.  The new
proposal also requires "tail gas" cleaning of nitrogen oxides,
which contribute to smog and acid rain, on those incinerators
which process more than 250 tons of trash daily.  This is
expected to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions by 40%.  These
new standards are expected to reduce 90% of the air pollutants by
1994, a reduction of more than a quarter million tons annually,
according to Robin Woods at EPA.
     The proposal requires monitoring and verification of
emissions by trained and certified supervisors.  By 1993, plants
would also be required to recycle 25% of the trash they process.
If approved, the new rules would be applied directly to the 150
incinerators that will be constructed at 60 US facilities in the
next five years, with the 450 incinerators currently in operation
at 200 plants being given several years to make the necessary
improvements.  Dave Ryan at the EPA told GECR that it may be a
full year before this proposal is approved and instituted.
     Woods estimates the national costs associated with the
proposed standards for new facilities to be $190 million
annually, which represents an increase of $13 per ton of
incinerated trash from the current $60 per ton.  It would cost
$320 million a year nationally to improve existing facilities, an
increase of $12 per ton.  In both cases, this translates to an
increase of $20 per year per household.  Public hearings will be
held in Boston on 22-23 January, Detroit on 25-26 January, and
Seattle on 30-31 January.  For more information on the public
hearings, call Ann Eleanor of the EPA at TEL: +1-919-541-5578.

global change scientists can be happy:  1990 federal funding for
climate change-related research is five times greater than it was
in 1989.  Much of the growth can be attributed to redefinitions
and shifts of existing programs to fall under the "global change"
umbrella.  A total of $664 million will be available, with the
Department of Energy getting the biggest relative increase ($60
million).  Most of the funding ($489 million of it) sits with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
