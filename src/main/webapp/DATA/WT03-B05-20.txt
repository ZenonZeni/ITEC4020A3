 BRAZIL: RATES OF EXCHANGE AND RECOVERY

 Rudiger Dornbusch's claim that the Brazilian real is heavily overvalued has 
once again raised the question of whether Brazil and indeed the whole of the 
region is running a sustainable mix of economic policies. Dornbusch, a 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims that Brazil 
is in the same position Mexico was in 1994 and that the real is between 30% 
and 40% overvalued.

 We do not believe him, as we explain overleaf in our commentary on Brazil. 
We argue that unlike Mexico, the real's exchange rate against the dollar is 
not a proxy for an overvalued or undervalued exchange rate. 

 Brazil does much less trade (about 20% of its total) with the US than most 
Latin American countries. Mexico by contrast does more:  almost 70% of its 
trade is with the US. We argue that this difference means that whether 
Brazil's currency is overvalued should be assessed on a trade weighted 
basis.

 We would argue that Brazil's ability to maintain export growth suggests 
that its currency is not too overvalued. The Brazilian government's 
ruthlessness in slapping on tariffs when domestic industries are threatened 
makes it difficult to gauge whether the currency is overvalued, judging by 
whether imports are rising or falling. 

 What does seem clear to us is that Brazil is more likely to follow 
Argentina than Mexico in its method for adjusting domestic prices. Mexico 
devalued, and thus made domestic prices internationally competitive. 
Argentina is sticking to the more difficult, but probably ultimately more 
rewarding, policy of using a fixed exchange rate to force the domestic 
economy to become competitive. 

 Like Mexico, the result of this has been a painful recession, huge numbers 
of unemployed and more recently a pretty feeble economic recovery. The 
economic recovery, like Mexico's, is being led by investment and exports, 
rather than by growth in domestic spending.  

 Argentina's problem is its tax structure. This is tilted heavily towards 
consumption taxes which are not very productive in periods of recession. The 
government has to push on with its tax reform plans, and actually get some 
of them through congress if it is to avoid disaster. 

 What Argentina's policymakers are doing is using the recession to force 
domestic prices to adjust to international prices in real terms. Under the 
convertibility scheme goods and services in Argentina appeared to be 
expensive and imports started to flood the market. Although imports fell as 
Argentina's economy slowed down and then went into recession last year, 
exports actually continued to rise. Although Argentina's export performance 
is distorted by its heavy exports of wheat and other grains, it does seem 
that manufactured goods have managed to find export markets, particularly in 
Brazil. This suggest that the economy is adjusting successfully.

 Of course the same could be said of Mexico. If anything, its increase in 
manufactured exports has been more impressive: 30% last year and on top of 
that 25% this year. The problem though is that the performance of Mexican 
manufactures is distorted firstly by the effects of the maquiladoras, which 
are simply cheap labour operations, and secondly by the dominance of the US 
market in its foreign trade.

 This means that it is far from clear that the whole of the economy is 
benefitting from the devaluation. Even the government is now concerned by 
the fact that exports are so concentrated. It should be even more concerned 
by the sharp increase in luxury car imports which we report on in our 
analysis of Mexico. This suggests that the centrifugal forces in the economy 
are getting stronger.

 BRAZIL: REALISTIC FORECASTS: AS TRADE ACCOUNT TURNS AROUND

 Pedro Malan, the finance minister, gave a realistic assessment of where the 
Brazilian economy stood to two senate commissions, finance and tax, last 
month. He has downgraded the official forecast of growth for this year from 
5% to between 3% and 3.5%. He said that over the first two quarters of the 
year the economy had actually contracted, though there was now evidence that 
this recessionary phase had ended and the economy would grow strongly in the 
second half of the year. 

 The Instituto de Pesquisa y Economia Aplicada (Ipea), which is attached to 
the planning ministry, said the GDP growth rate for the 12 months to June 
1996 was 1.2%. It pointed out that this was an improvement on the minus 2.1% 
figure to the end of March.

 Other Ipea indicators are also beginning to flash green for growth. Its 
survey of industrial production found that there was a 3.9% increase in 
April compared to March. This franked the findings by the Federacao das 
Industrias de Sao Paulo (Fiesp) which reckoned that industrial output had 
surged by 4.7% between March and April. 

 Fiscal deficit. Malan was equally optimistic about the prospects for the 
fiscal deficit. He told the senate committees that the operating deficit 
would come down from 5% of GDP (last year) to 2.5% this year, and the 
nominal deficit would be about 5% of GDP, compared to 7.3% last year. He 
added that progress on the fiscal deficit depended on the government getting 
its constitutional reforms through congress. In particular, it wants to 
reform the social security system and the bureaucracy, the two main 
consumers of tax revenues.

 The treasury reckons that it ran a 671m reais surplus in May after 
collecting taxes worth 7bn reais. The surplus was largely because it did not 
have to make any extraordinary payments. The accumulated deficit for the 
first five months of the year is around 3.8bn reais, the treasury reckons. 

 The deficit is likely to increase sharply in June as the 13th month bonus 
falls due and 500m reais of holiday payments to bureaucrats fall due. 
Foreign debt payments are also likely to increase from May's 1.26bn reais.

 Trade. The really encouraging statistic comes from the trade account. 
According to Malan, export revenues are up by 10% in the first five months 
of the year (despite the collapse of coffee revenues), while the import bill 
is down by between 8% and 9%. Export revenues in May were US Dollars 4.5bn, 
and imports were worth about US Dollars 4.1bn. 

 The government is calculating on the trade account being more or less in 
balance by the end of the year. Some trade officials though believe this 
could be an underestimate and that the country is on course to  register its 
traditional trade surplus.

 The authorities are certainly doing their best to boost exports. On 19 
June, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced that the government was 
restoring an export credit scheme which had been suspended as part of its 
cost cutting programme. The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ^mico now 
has US Dollars 1bn to finance particular categories of exports. It is 
offering credit at the rate of 5.5% over Libor for 15 months. 

 Antonio Kandir, the planning minister, said that rate was around a third of 
what the commercial banks were charging. The credit is aimed at 10 
industries: shoes, clothes, carparts, furniture, ceramics. whitegoods, 
electrical products, ironmongery, plastics and ornamental stone. 

 The credit is designed to help industries such as clothes and shoes which 
have been badly hit by the trade liberalisation policies while boosting the 
prospects of industries such as whitegoods and ceramics in which Brazil 
reckons it has a competitive advantage. The government is particularly keen 
on boosting ornamental stone exports: exports of marble and granite trebled 
last year to US Dollars 35m.

 Industrialists were pleased by the credit line. Luis Fernando Furlan, 
director of foreign trade at the Federacao das Industrias de Sao Paulo, 
reckoned that the effects of the credit line would be as beneficial to 
exports as a devaluation. 

 Besides putting the credit line in place, the government is also musing 
over creating an export credit guarantee agency, which would be capitalised 
largely with money from the private sector. This agency would try to compete 
with the Eximbanks, Cofaces and Hermeses of the developed world, which offer 
long term specialised finance to exporters. Brazilian industrialists reckon 
that this financing often offsets higher production costs in OECD countries 
and keeps exports from these countries competitive.

 Brazilian industrialists and trade officials moan that the system does not 
give exporters as much help: in fact they often face export taxes. Malan 
said that the government was trying to reform this, but its tax reform 
package was being stalled by congress. 

 Dagoberto Godoy, president of the Federacao das Industrias de Rio Grande do 
Sul, said that one possible answer would be to copy what Argentina had done: 
it had ended taxes on exports. 

 Current account. Malan's testimony to the senate committee was optimistic 
about the country's overall balance of payments. He reckoned that the 
country would run a current account deficit of around 2.5% of GDP, largely 
because of interest payments. He said the country should have little trouble 
financing this deficit because inflows of long term capital were so strong.

 In the first five months of the year longterm investments amounted to US 
Dollars 3.2bn, he said. The government was forecasting US Dollars 7bn by the 
end of the year. The country also had US Dollars 60bn in foreign exchange 
reserves at the end of May. 

 Dornbusch. The reserve figure and the strong inflows of foreign capital do 
not support Rudiger Dornbusch's claim that Brazil is about to face its own 
version of the 1994 Mexican devaluation crisis. Dornbusch claimed that the 
real is between 30% and 40% overvalued. He asserted that bringing the 
currency back towards its proper value would cause an economic dislocation 
on a par with what has happened in Mexico.

 We disagree with both Dornbusch's premise and his conclusion. To take the 
conclusion first. We believe that the quality of economic management in 
Brazil is far superior to that in Mexico. 

 There are two reasons for this. The first is that Brazil produces superior 
statistics and economic research: this breeds a lot more objective criticism 
of economic policy. 

 The second reason is related to this. The Brazilian government tends to be 
more responsive to alternative ideas and follows policies that are broadly 
related to what is happening in the Brazilian economy. Mexico is still far 
too interested in doing what pleases its international creditors. That 
attitude, above all else, was the reason for the Mexican crisis. Gimmicks 
such as Tesobonos which guaranteed investors against a devaluation boxed the 
Mexican government in and prevented it from devaluing until the economy was 
past the point of caring. 

 We do not accept Dornbusch's premise that the real is 40% overvalued. It 
may well be 10% to 20% overvalued against the dollar, but on a trade 
weighted basis the real is probably pretty fairly valued. The dollar is 
still cheap compared to DM and Yen.

 Unlike Mexico, Brazil's trade is not dominated by the US: almost 70% of 
Mexico's exports go to the US; only about 35% of Brazil's do. This means 
that a trade weighted measure of whether the real is overvalued is a more 
appropriate analytical tool, than a simple calculation against the dollar. 
(By analogy, the Swiss franc, French franc and DM all may be overvalued 
against the dollar but fairly valued against each other which is much more 
important from an economic point of view because so much of the three 
countries trade is with each other). 

 We would say that the Argentine peso is certainly at least as much 
overvalued against the dollar as the real. Yet the pattern of trade between 
Argentina and Brazil suggests to us that the two currencies are now pretty 
much fairly valued against each other.  The growth in Brazilian exports and 
drop in imports, plus the strength of direct investment in Brazil all 
suggests that the real is not massively overvalued. 

 Inflation: The government is forecasting an inflation rate of between 12% 
and 13% for the year. In the first five months of the year, inflation was 
5.1% according to the Fundacao Getulio Vargas and 14% for the 12 months to 
May. In May the rate of 1.55% was higher than the rate of devaluation 
against the dollar and the return on 30-day fixed deposits (1.5%). 

 Textiles: The government has imposed quotas on textiles from Panama, China 
and Taiwan (none of these countries yet belongs to the WTO) and is 
considering taking measures against four WTO members: Pakistan, South Korea, 
Hong Kong and Thailand. The authorities are under pressure from the textile 
industry to curb cheap imports. According to the textile industry, the 
number of companies has fallen from 832 in 1994 to 621 this year and that 
20,000 workers have lost their jobs because of unfair competition. 

 Unemployment: The Departamento Intersindical de Estudios Socioeconomicos 
calculates that unemployment is 15.9%. The government maintains that the 
official figure (which has risen from 5.7% to 6.4%) is more accurate. 

 The government admits that 2.1m jobs have been lost between 1988 and 1995. 
It blames the combination of the 1988 constitution, which guaranteed workers 
an annual bonus of a month's salary, maternity leave and lavish pensions, 
for pricing Brazilians out of jobs. It also says that the heavy investment 
in improved technology might have had something to do with the job losses. 

 Black economy: One in four workers in Rio de Janeiro makes a living from 
the black economy. That is 625,000 out of a total of 2.5m.

 MEXICO: GETTING BETTER: BUT STILL NOT OUT OF THE WOODS

 The gulf between what international investment bankers think is happening 
in Mexico and what Mexican businessmen know is happening seems to be getting 
even wider. On 22 June, Carlos Abascal, president of the Confederacion 
Patronal de la Republica Mexicana (Coparmex) urged his members not to panic. 
He said that while it was impossible to ignore reality and to believe that 
things were starting to improve, industrialists should not just give up and 
believe that things would never get better. 

 Abascal called upon the government to face reality and to stop pretending 
that everything was going swimmingly. He pointed out that the government 
could make a good case for itself, without saying that everything was rosy.

 Abascal is particularly concerned about the state of the banking system. He 
claimed that the government had so far done pretty well, pointing out that 
the rescue of the financial system had cost a mere 6.5% of GDP compared to 
the 30% of GDP Chile had to spend at the beginning of the 1980s when its 
financial system was wrecked by a devaluation following a period of peso 
overvaluation. 

 Coparmex, however, is not sure that the financial system has got over all 
its difficulties. Abascal said that the government needed to pay more 
attention to the banks' bad debt problems and come up with more schemes to 
convert debt into equity. He said that more help for the agricultural 
sector, which is also facing another year of drought, is urgently needed.

 Abascal also said that the government needed to introduce a more 
stimulatory fiscal policy (reduce taxes on new cars and corporate assets and 
rethink income taxes) and to ensure that the exchange rate remained 
competitive. 

 By contrast. The investment banks, on the other hand, can barely see 
further than the next mandate. Guy Erb, head of Goldman Sachs's Mexico 
office said that there was no sign that Mexico had saturated the 
international capital markets with its paper. John Donelly, head of Chase 
Manhattan's Mexico operations, said that the international markets were 
pleased by President Ernesto Zedillo's implementation of last year's 
economic plan. He said that the President had stuck to the letter of the 
plan. 

 Jaime Alatorre, from the Consejo Mexicano de Inversiones, claimed that 
foreign investors had poured US Dollars 1bn into the Mexican stockmarket 
this year. This was twice what they invested in the whole of 1995. Overall 
Mexico expects to attract financial investments (ie foreign investment in 
the Bolsa, GDR issues or debt issues on international markets) of US Dollars 
8bn this year. 

 Unemployment. To be fair there is some evidence that the economy has 
touched bottom. The most obvious indicator of this is the drop in 
unemployment. According to the official statistics agency, the Instituto 
Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica, the rate in May was 5.4%. 
This is a whole percentage point below the 6.4% recorded in January. This 
means that 2.67m Mexicans were officially unemployed in May.

 Inegi also reported that the percentage of workers either on strike or 
looking for a job has fallen from 10% in January to 8.8% in May. According 
to the agency 21% of Mexican workers still work less than 35 hours a week.

 Car sales. Another encouraging statistic is the pick up in car sales. In 
the first quarter domestic car sales were 24% higher than in the same period 
of 1995. Car imports increased by 65%. The most popular imports have been 
off-road vehicles (such as Explorer, Cherokee, Voyager and Land Rover) 
though imports of Mercedes Benzes and BMWs also increased sharply.   

 Even so, car sales still have some way to go to make up the ground they 
lost last year. The value of car sales dropped by 70% in 1995; volumes fell 
by 17% and sales of imports dropped by 65%. The industry, which supplies 18% 
of the country's manufacturing jobs, pulled through by increasing exports: 
these jumped by 28% in 1995.

 Exports are still strong. In the first quarter they increased by 39%. 
Overall production was 305,592 units.  

 Growth. The finance minister, Guillermo Ortiz, is still confident that the 
economy will grow by 3% this year. He said that his main concern now was 
ensuring that the growth rate remained at or above this level for the next 
few years.

 Even Ortiz is now conceding (what industrialists know) that the domestic 
market is still in difficulties. He said that domestic demand would grow by 
about 2% this year: a pretty feeble recovery after the 14% fall in 1995. 
Ortiz admitted that the recovery of the domestic economy was slower than had 
been expected because of the over-indebtedness of individuals and companies. 

 Inflation. The OECD's forecast for inflation in Mexico this year is 33%. 
This is well above the government's forecast of 21%. For 1997, the OECD is 
forecasting 17%. 

 In May, the CPI figure was 1.81%, well below the 2.8% recorded in April. 
The rate for the 12 months to June was 34%. The rate for the first five 
months of the year was 13.5%.

 What is slightly alarming about the inflation figure is the sharp rise in 
fruit and vegetable prices in May.

 Agriculture. The rise in food prices is partly due to the drought in the 
north of the country. This has hit the cattle industry particularly hard: 
Mexico's imports of meat increased by 94% in the first quarter of the year 
(admittedly to only US Dollars 11m) while its imports of milk almost 
quadrupled (to a more economically significant US Dollars 136m). 

 Already the number of cattle has fallen by a third to 9m as farmers cut 
their losses by slaughtering stock rather than buying expensive feed. 

 The government is also expecting to have to increase its imports of grains, 
especially maize. 

 OECD. Besides being more realistic about inflation than the government, the 
OECD is also pretty gloomy about growth prospects. It reckons that the 
economy will grow by at most 3% this year, but does not offer a figure for 
1997. The OECD highlights the fragility of the banking sector and the 
weakness of domestic demand: two of our themes over the past year. 

 More encouragingly, the OECD expects imports to pick up this year, but it 
does not expect more than a small current account deficit. The OECD expects 
this deficit to increase to 2% of GDP (US Dollars 6bn) in 1997.

 Trade account. The Secretaria de Hacienda reported that the country had 
record exports in May. It exported goods worth US Dollars 8.046bn and ran a 
trade surplus of US Dollars 532m.

 This brings the trade surplus for the first five months of the year to US 
Dollars 3.17bn. In 1995, the country ran a trade surplus of US Dollars 
7.35bn after running a deficit of US Dollars 18.5bn in 1994.

 What is encouraging is the increase in imports. These rose by 25% (year-on-
year) in May to US Dollars 7.5bn. This is sharply higher than the increase 
for the first five months as a whole which was only 8%. 

 Equally encouraging is the continuing growth in manufactured exports: these 
amounted to US Dollars 31bn for the first five months of the year (22% above 
the comparable figure for 1995). Oil revenues accounted for 12% of Mexico's 
total export revenues of US Dollars 37.7bn. This was 16% more than for the 
same period of 1995.

 MEXICO: THE REAL ECONOMY: STILL TILTED: TOWARDS EXPORTS

 The economic recovery is still heavily skewed. A study by the newspaper El 
Financiero, based on data from the finance ministry and the central bank for 
the first quarter, found that while exporting companies grew by 13.4% in 
real terms, domestic consumption grew by just 1.3%. and investment fell by 
4%.

 The investment figures are particularly disappointing. Another newspaper, 
Reforma, took a look at how companies had made out on the investments they 
promised to make in November 1995. The government had trumpeted the fact 
that the private sector would invest US Dollars 6bn in 1996.

 In fact, as Reforma found, very little of this investment has actually been 
made. Of the 28 companies quoted on the stockmarket which promised to invest 
US Dollars 4.4bn, 11 have invested nothing and have no plans to do so this 
year.

 Among these companies are ICA, a construction company, which promised to 
invest US Dollars 590m but has invested nothing; Bufete another construction 
company which promised US Dollars 255m but has invested nothing. Nine other 
companies have invested less than they promised (including Telmex, Iusacell 
and Alfa). 

 On the other hand three companies, Televisa, Gissa and Soriana have 
invested more than they promised and 14 have delivered on their promises. 

 EU: The European Union has formally given the go-ahead for the commission 
to start negotiations with Mexico about a free trade agreement. The 
agreement had been blocked by Britain as part of its non-cooperation policy 
with the EU in order to force concessions from its EU partners over the EU 
ban on exports of British beef and beef products.

 The EU and Mexico have agreed to set up a bilateral steering group which 
will decide on methods and a schedule for overcoming both the tariff and 
non-tariff barriers which block the way to freer trade. 

 Mexico believes that it should benefit from freer trade with the EU. In 
1995, it ran a deficit of US Dollars 3.35bn with the EU. 

 Steel production: Mexico's steel production in the first four months of the 
year was 11% higher this year (at 4.3m t) than in the same period of 1995, 
the Camara Nacional de Acero reported. The Camara says that if the industry 
keeps on at the current rate the country will produce 13m t of steel this 
year. This would represent a capacity utilisation rate of 92%. The biggest 
increase has been in laminated products where output has increased by 52% to 
1.6m t. 

 Teachers: A large number of the country's most important group of 
employees, the teachers, has rejected the government's offer of a 12% wage 
increase which was accepted by the official teachers union. The teachers 
launched a series of protests and demonstrations in the first half of June 
to back up their demands for a doubling of their wages. They currently 
receive US Dollars 226 a month.

 What unnerved the government was the strength of support for the claim. On 
five consecutive days over 20,000 people marched through the capital, 
demanding higher wages.

 The government felt that it had to respond, and officials from three 
ministries (interior, education and finance) met leaders of the dissident 
teachers. President Zedillo also asked the head of the capital's police 
force to resign after his heavy handed policing of the teachers' 
demonstrations left a dozen people injured.

 ARGENTINA: A BIT OF A JAGGED RECOVERY: QUESTIONS ABOUT FIRST QUARTER GROWTH

 The claims by the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, that the economy 
contracted by only 3.2% in the first quarter has been greeted with 
scepticism in Buenos Aires. Given that in the first quarter, agriculture 
probably declined by 5%, industry by 6% and construction by 17%, the rest of 
the economy (which accounts for the remaining 60% of output) must have done 
remarkably well.

 To be fair, the evidence is that oil and gas production, mining, power 
generation and other utilities had a good quarter. Equally, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that the tertiary sector of the economy had a poor 
quarter.

 More worrying is the most recent industrial trends survey from the 
Fundacion de Investigaciones Economicas Latinoamericanas which suggests that 
industrialists are revising downwards their expectations for business in the 
next six months.

 Just as alarming is the data for bankruptcies. Although the number of 
companies seeking reschedulings with their creditors fell by 10% between 
February and May 1996 (compared with the same period of 1995), the size of 
the debts involved increased by 13% in real terms. As for bankruptcies, the 
number of companies going bust increased by 74% although the amount of money 
involved increased by only 7%. 

 Lowest interest rates. Even the steady increase in bank deposits is not yet 
having a beneficial economic effect. Bank deposits topped US Dollars 50bn at 
the end of the May. This is a third more than in the same month of 1995 and 
11% up on 1994's figure.

 The government points out that this increase in liquidity has allowed 
interest rates to fall by two and a half percentage points: the prime rate 
is now 6.4%. These are the lowest rates since the convertibility plan 
started in 1991.  

 Bankers say that this abundance of liquidity has yet to tempt consumers to 
start borrowing again. They say that both companies and households are not 
yet confident enough about their economic prospects to gear up.  

 External sector. What seems clear  is that the external sector is still 
doing much better than the domestic part of the economy. Car exports to 
Brazil are still strong and agricultural exports have risen impressively. 
According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos, agricultural 
and food exports, (excluding rice, sunflowers and soya oil, which are major 
revenue earners) were US Dollars 910m for the first two months of the year. 
This was 28% up on the comparable period of 1995. 

 Indec noted that meat, fish and fruit had been the biggest revenue earners 
but the biggest increases had come from sugar and alcoholic drinks. 

 The government is continuing to revise upwards its figure for agricultural 
exports. It now reckons that the country could export US Dollars 10bn worth 
of primary and processed foodstuffs. 

 Brazilian business. Exports are hugely dependent on what happens in its 
larger neighbour. The Argentine ambassador to Brazil, Alieto Guadagni, said 
that Argentina's exports to its neighbour should be worth US Dollars 7bn 
this year. Last year Argentina shipped US Dollars 5.6bn worth of goods to 
Brazil.

 Cavallo himself underlined how important a flourishing Brazil now is to 
Argentina's economic recovery. He paid a quick visit to Brasilia to meet the 
whole of the Brazilian economic team to check that they would not change the 
economic policy in early June. During a series of meetings with everyone 
from President Cardoso down, Cavallo said that it was clear that Brazil 
would not change its exchange rate nor its economic policy. 

 Cavallo claims that the two economies were now in some sort of economic 
sync: both would grow this year and register low inflation. Low inflation is 
likely. A more open question is whether Argentina will hit Cavallo's target 
of 5% growth this year: the consensus in Argentina is that the economy will 
do well to grow by 3%.  

 Deficit. The government's fiscal position is still under pressure. The 
fiscal deficit may not just be a temporary problem caused by the 
sluggishness of the economy which has hit revenues. The creation of private 
pension funds has deprived the government of an important source of cash. It 
can also be argued that the decision to lower employers' compulsory 
inflation adjust for pensions (a liability which has been switched to the 
government) will also put pressure on government finances, even when the 
economy recovers. 

 The government has already consulted the IMF about getting some leeway for 
this year's fiscal targets. In the first four months of the year it had 
already run up a deficit equivalent to 70% of the US Dollars 2.5bn that was 
envisaged for the year as a whole. 

 The government is likely to be able to muddle through this year, but next 
year the problems will be even worse. Firstly its debt service payments will 
rise, as principal payments started on Bocones and the costs of the huge 
amount of borrowing in the past year or so start to have an effect. The 
other problem will be the consolidation of the (bust) provincial pension 
funds into the national state fund. 

 The government is still shirking structural reform measures: its only 
response to the growing problem has been to borrow more to shore up this 
year's accounts. In 1995 the country increased its net debt by US Dollars 
5.8bn and this year it has borrowed between US Dollars 4bn and US Dollars 
6bn.

 This is a dangerous policy. If US interest rates start to rise in the 
autumn, as the US credit markets expect, Argentina could find the door to 
the international credit markets slammed shut in its face. The crunch could 
come at the beginning of 1997.

 VENEZUELA: INFLATION KEY: AND CUTTING THE BUREAUCRACY

 The planning minister, Teodoro Petkoff, is clear about the economic 
variable which will determine the success or failure of the current economic 
plan: inflation. He recently told an audience of New York bankers and 
businessmen that nothing was more important for the poor and lower middle 
class than a lower inflation rate.

 Petkoff is still confident that the inflation rate will start to ebb this 
month: he is still aiming for a 2% monthly rate by December. 

 Petkoff was more guarded about the government's spending plans: he said 
that the government could not slash the social payments, but would take 
action to reorientate them. This is a reference to the increased social 
security payments the government announced along with its adjustment package 
in April.

 The government doubled the value of the payments it makes under its food 
stamps programme: this enables the poor to buy staples such as milk, eggs 
and rice. The government also doubled pensions and announced youth job 
creation schemes and an increase in the subsidised medicine programme. The 
IMF has put pressure on the government to reduce these payments. 

 Bureaucracy. The government is unwilling to cut these payments by as much 
as the IMF wants. Petkoff has made it clear that he would prefer to cut 
government spending by slimming down the civil service. He notes that 
Venezuela has 800,000 civil servants: that is 300,000 more than Brazil, he 
claimed. 

 Petkoff said that he did not expect to push through a six month programme 
to slash civil service numbers, as this would produce chaos and unrest. The 
first government move, he said, would be the imposition of a hiring freeze.

 Managing this process, Petkoff reckons, will be far from easy. But he said 
that the bureaucracy had to be cut back if the fiscal deficit was to be 
brought under control. 

 The banking system. There are signs that the banking system is on the mend: 
Jose Maria Nogueroles, president of Banco Provincial, the country's solidest 
bank, said that the bank's capital position was 13% stronger in real terms 
in March 1996 than in March 1995.

 The government is hoping to take advantage of this favourable wind to sell 
two of the banks it rescued in 1994. The big sale will be Banco de 
Venezuela, the country's second biggest bank but the government is also 
trying to sell the smaller Banco Tequendama.

 Banco de Venezuela now has assets of US Dollars 812m and according to a 
private consultancy, Softline, deposits of US Dollars 700m. Salomon Brothers 
is advising the government on the sale. Prequalification for potential 
bidders closed on 7 June. 

 The government has also pencilled in November as the date for the sale of 
Banco Consolidado, the country's fourth biggest bank. 

 Petkoff said the country hoped to get a loan of US Dollars 1bn from the 
multilaterals to help pay for the restructuring of the banking system. He 
reckoned this would be about half the total cost of sorting out the system.

 IMF. Petkoff has refused to give details on exactly how much the country is 
hoping to get from the multilaterals. The IMF has agreed to lend the country 
US Dollars 1.4bn over 12 months, and the deal is scheduled to be signed this 
month. 

 According to Petkoff, the loan can be converted into a structural 
adjustment facility at the end of the year if the government and the IMF 
agree. 

 Petkoff is also negotiating loans from the World Bank and the IDB. The 
country is expecting to get US Dollars 900m from the World Bank and US 
Dollars 1bn from the IDB. These loans will be designed to help pay for the 
restructuring of the financial sector and to ease the adjustment burden. It 
is likely that these loans, especially the money from the World Bank, will 
be tied to the privatisation programme. 

 Airlines: Other airlines are joining American Airlines in demanding 
compensation from the government for the losses caused by the government's 
exchange rate policies. American Airlines has asked for US Dollars 8m. 
Another 10 airlines say that the changes in the exchange rate have cost them 
US Dollars 21m. The airlines say that the losses were caused by the 
government's policy of exchange controls which tried to hold the bolivar at 
170 (and then 290) to the dollar. 

 American and the other airlines claim that their applications to exchange 
bolivars for dollars were blocked from July to September 1995 (when the rate 
was 170) and that they were only paid when the bolivar had dropped to 290 to 
the dollar. Under international agreements with the airlines, countries 
undertake to recompense airlines for losses caused by exchange rate 
variations. 

 Although the government is fighting the case in the courts, the finance 
minister, Luis Matos Azocar, is making conciliatory noises and says that an 
out-of-court settlement should be reached. He also pointed out, however, 
that the exchange control regime did not guarantee that companies would be 
able to get all the dollars they had asked for. 

 Reformulated petrol: The government is pleased by the WTO's decision in its 
favour. The WTO has ruled that the US was acting in a protectionist way by 
allowing US refineries more time to meet clean air standards. Imported 
reformulated petrol had to meet the new standards immediately. Venezuela, 
which was exporting between 55,000 and 60,000bpd of reformulated petrol, 
argued that the measure discriminated against its exports because US 
produced products did not have to meet the same standards. The state oil 
company PDVSA said that the unfair trade practice cost it about US Dollars 
50m because it had to ship the product to less profitable markets.

 CHILE: BANK LAW READY FOR APPROVAL: FROM IMPORTER TO EXPORTER

 Congress is on the point of passing a new banking law. This would both free 
the banks to do more internationally and domestically, define bank secrecy 
and force banks to meet the so called Basle committee's minimum, risk-
weighted capital adequacy standards.

 The law was designed by the previous government and included provisions to 
sort out the subordinated debt question. The state still holds a lot of 
subordinated debt issued by Chilean banks to stave off their collapse at the 
beginning of the 1980s. This issue has now been separated from the other 
issues which will modify the Ley General de Bancos. 

 Chile has 34 banks, of which 19 are foreign owned, three are sociedades 
financieras and one is state owned, Banco del Estado. Standard & Poor's, one 
of the world's most important credit rating agencies, recently issued a 
report which claimed that Chile had the solidest banking system in the 
region. Indeed the banks' non-performing loans have fallen from 2.1% of 
total assets in 1990 to about 1%. 

 The new businesses that banks will be able to get into are insurance (but 
not life assurance) stockbroking, factoring, running mutual funds and funds 
for investment overseas, custody of securities and financial advice.

 Subordinated debt. The banks have until 23 July to do a deal with the 
central bank to sort out the subordinated debt issue. The central bank now 
holds US Dollars 4.58bn worth of subordinated debt. The banks with the 
biggest amounts still outstanding at the end of March 1996 were Banco de 
Santiago (US Dollars 1.7bn);  Banco de Chile (US Dollars 1.7bn); Banco de 
Concepcion (US Dollars 654m); BHIF (US Dollars 380m) and Banco Internacional 
(US Dollars 127m). Under the terms of the deal to rescue banks in 1982 the 
central bank bought the bank's non-performing loans from them with 
subordinated debt: the banks undertook to buy the debt back over time, but 
no deadline was set. 

 The economy: The government is still concerned about inflation. It wants to 
hit its target of 6.5% for the year and is prepared to keep the currency 
overvalued (at least against the dollar) until the 12 month lagging rate 
comes closer to that target. The 12 month lagging rate stood at 8.6% at the 
end of May. The government has also indicated that it will not hesitate to 
increase interest rates (as it did in March) if it believes that the economy 
is growing too fast. In the first quarter the rate of growth was verging on 
9%. Growth last year was 8.25%, the highest in Latin America. 

 Investment: The finance minister said that the public sector would spend US 
Dollars 7.89bn between 1996 and the end of the millennium on infrastructure 
projects. He hoped that the private sector would invest a similar amount. 

 The president of the Camara Chilena de Construccion, Eugenio Velasco, 
reckoned that the country needs US Dollars 14.2bn worth of infrastructure 
over the next five years: he said that bottlenecks at ports and poor roads 
cost the country US Dollars 1.65bn in lost exports and repairs every year. 

 This year private sector investment in infrastructure is likely to 
increase. In 1995 it jumped to US Dollars 509m from US Dollars 31m in 1994. 
The government's target for 1996 is US Dollars 2.5bn. Most private sector 
construction projects are financed by bank loans. 

 Pension funds: The pension funds are finding the going tough. In the year 
to May they have returned only 1.2%., well below the average annual return 
of 12.6% since 1981.  The fund administrators point out that the worst may 
now be over: the funds rose by 1.7% in May. The best performers were 
Habitat, Aporta and Valora, which rose by 9%. The funds have assets of US 
Dollars 26.8bn, 40% of which is in Chilean government debt, a third in 
shares and 24% in private sector debt. Less than 0.2% of the funds' assets 
are invested internationally.

 COLOMBIA: SAMPER CLEARED: BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN

 President Ernesto Samper was cleared of knowing that his successful 
election campaign was financed by the drug cartels. He was cleared after an 
investigation by the Camara de Representantes. The US attitude to Colombia 
is still unclear though the omens are not good.

 Although the US ambassador to Colombia, Myles Frechette, said that the US 
wants to boost trade between the two countries, the Colombians are fretting 
about sanctions that may be taken because of a dispute involving American 
Airlines. Until 1993 American flew from new York to Bogota; but it then 
suspended the service, saying it was not making money. The Colombian 
authorities awarded the route to Continental Airlines earlier this year, 
producing squawks of outrage from American. The US government has taken up 
American's complaint and threatened Avianca's daily flight from Bogota to 
New York. The Colombians have rejected the suggested compromise from the US 
that two airlines from each country should fly the route: the Colombians say 
that this would produce too much capacity. 

 Car sales: Sales of imported cars fell by 23% in the first four months of 
the year. Sales of domestically assembled cars dropped 13%. 

 Investment: Foreign investment in Colombia increased by 19% in the first 
two months of the year to US Dollars 160m, according to the Corporacion 
Invertir en Colombia. The financial sector was the most popular, accounting 
for US Dollars 75m of new investment.

 Ganadero: A Spanish bank, BBV, bought 40% of Banco Ganadero for US Dollars 
300m. Ganadero has assets of US Dollars 3bn and made US Dollars 14m in the 
first quarter of this year.

 ECUADOR: BUCARAM AHEAD: BUSINESS ALARMED

 Businessmen are alarmed at the strong support for the Guayaquil populist 
Abdala Bucaram. He did much better in the first round than the opinion polls 
had suggested and looks more confident going into the run-off with Jaime 
Nebot on 7 July. Nebot is the candidate of the firmly middle class Partido 
Social Cristiano and if he should lose there is likely to be a bout of sucre 
weakness. The new government does not take office until August. 

 Bucaram's economic policies are not particularly clear. He has refused to 
debate with other candidates, preferring to issue pamphlets saying that he 
will not follow the current economic policies which he says pander to the 20 
national monopolies. Exactly who he will use to advise him on how to run the 
economy is unclear: all Bucaram will say is that he is a friend of Roberto 
Isaias, the owner of Filanbanco, one of the country's biggest banks, and 
interests in sugar and the media. Bucaram made his career as a populist 
mayor of Guayaquil where he developed a taste (reputation) for wild 
rhetoric. He was not generally considered to be a likely winner of the 
election. 

 Nebot, by contrast, was the longtime favourite. He is known to support more 
liberalisation and privatisation. 

 The country's electoral law bars opinion polls from being published in the 
run up to the election. One of the last, published on 2 June, after the 
first round results, gave Bucaram 44% of the votes against 31% to Nebot and 
24% undecided. The problem for Nebot is that the supporters of the third and 
fourth candidates in the first round, Freddy Ehlers and Rodrigo Paz, are 
unlikely to support his economic policies which form a key part of his 
platform: Ehlers was against opening up the economy and Paz and his party 
have opposed economic reform. 

 Although the second round will determine who becomes President, the first 
round has elected the members of congress. Here Nebot seems to have fallen 
short of the 30 seat target he set himself.

 PERU: MORE BUREAUCRATS TO BE SACKED: TO BOOST CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

 The government wants to cut the number of bureaucrats. This was one of its 
main promises to the IMF in its recent letter of intent. Over the past five 
years the government has already trimmed its workforce by 1m. Nevertheless, 
900,000 people still work for the government. 

 Despite these cuts, paying for the bureaucracy still swallows 65% of the 
country's tax revenues. The country collects US Dollars 242m a month in tax 
and customs duties. 

 This heavy bureaucratic expense means, the government says, that its 
spending on capital projects and debt payments is reduced. 

 In parallel with its plans to reduce the bureaucracy, the government is 
also trying to create 130,000 jobs a year as part of its anti-poverty 
programme. 

 The government wants to streamline both the central government and regional 
government. It says that there are still too many rules and regulations 
covering budgeting, accounting, cash management and procurement. 

 The government now wants to get each part of the administration to set its 
own systems, which it hopes will be more practical than a generalised system 
to cover every bureaucratic eventuality. The government also says that it 
will try to make individuals in the bureaucracy responsible for their 
actions.

 Tax overhaul. The government points out that the IMF has already welcomed 
some of its bureaucratic reforms, in particular its achievement in 
increasing the tax take from 5% of GDP to 14% in only four years. 

 The government also says that the IMF has said its privatisation and anti-
poverty programmes are models for other countries to follow. 

 The IMF has agreed to lend Peru US Dollars 150m to finance its Brady plan. 
This involves buying back debt and US Treasury bonds to back new bond 
issues. The government expects to sign its Brady deal in October. 

 Pension problems: The country's private pension system has lost US Dollars 
3m so far this year. Of the six Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones, only 
two, Horizonte and Integra, made profits. Both figures were marginal. 

 The companies say they are losing money because their marketing and 
operating costs are higher than their income. The main reason for this is 
that Peruvian companies are well behind on their payments to the AFPs. The 
official figure is that they are 50% in arrears. The AFP superintendency is 
mulling over the idea of offering companies easy terms to bring themselves 
back up to date. 

 So far the pension funds have signed up 1m people and built up funds of US 
Dollars 1bn. 

 Chilean investment: The Camara de Comercio de Santiago expects Chilean 
investment in Peru to hit US Dollars 3bn this year. This will be 30% more 
than the US Dollars 2.7bn registered at the end of 1995.

 The surge of Chilean investment has increased trade between the two 
countries, and led to a hefty Chilean trade surplus. Of the US Dollars 586m 
in total trade between the two countries, Chilean exports amounted to US 
Dollars 438m.  

 Tariffs: The government says that it will only move its tariff system to 
harmonise with the Andean Group's when that group lowers its tariffs to 
Peruvian rates. Peru still does not seem inclined to adopt the Andean 
Group's four rates for external tariffs (20%, 15% 10% and 5%). Peru's 
external tariff rates are 5%, 10% and 15%. 

 Currently Peru has partial free trade agreements with Colombia, Ecuador and 
Venezuela but does not apply the Andean groups external tariff system.

 BOLIVIA: DEBT NOT A PROBLEM: SAYS CAMDESSUS

 Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said that the country's 
foreign debt with the multilaterals should not impede its growth and 
economic development. Camdessus, who stopped in Bolivia during his tour of 
South America, said he was not coming to La Paz as some sort of 
international monetary policeman. He also said that it would be wrong to 
muddle up Bolivia's efforts to reduce its foreign debts with its fight 
against poverty. 

 Exports: The government is hoping that it can increase its soya exports 
once it is linked to the transport systems of the Mercosur.

 Banking system: Two thirds of the country's US Dollars 2.2bn in bank 
deposits are fixed term. A further 20% are held in current accounts, the 
Superintendencia de Bancos y Entidades Financieras reported in its 1995 
annual report.

 COSTA RICA: MISSING THE IMF TARGET: AS FIGUERES SNUBBED

 T
he government has admitted that it will miss the fiscal deficit target it 
agreed with the IMF this year. The target is 0.5% of GDP, but Fernando 
Herrero, who resigned as finance minister in June said that the likely 
outcome for this year would be a deficit of 2%. 

 Herrero said the government had been undone by two things: higher interest 
expenses (the government has run up domestic debts of US Dollars 2.9bn) and 
lower than expected tax revenues. The latter he said was due to the poor 
growth of the economy. 

 Herrero, who is handing over to Francisco de Paula Gutierrez, said the IMF 
may well take a lenient view of the missed targets, especially if it thought 
that other parts of the structural reform programme were going well. He did 
add, however, in his resignation report on the economy, that the government 
would need to raise new taxes to pay for its education, infrastructure and 
health programmes.

 De Paula Gutierrez. Herrero said he had resigned for personal reasons. He 
was married to another former member of the cabinet, Florisabel Rodriguez. 

 Herrero had presided over a fierce adjustment package to undo economic 
damage done in the first two years of President Jose Maria Figueres' 
administration. The worry is that political pressures will mean that the 
government will try to engineer a boom in the run-up to the elections in 
1997. The President has promised not to go for growth, but with over 50% of 
Costa Ricans reckoning that he has been a lousy President, this might 
change. 

 De Paula Gutierrez is a professional economist and has said the 
government's economic policy should not change. Before joining the 
government he was head of the Instituto Centroamericano de Administracion de 
Empresas. He is considered to be more of a free-marketeer than Herrero.  

 Contralor general: The government was forced to drop its contralor because 
of his closeness to the President. This made it doubtful that he could take 
an objective view of government spending. The new contralor, selected after 
three months of political bickering, is Luis Fernando Vargas, a member of 
the ruling PLN and a deputy labour minister in the Oscar Arias 
administration. Vargas's election is another snub to the President who 
supported another candidate. The (PLN) president of the legislative 
assembly, Walter Coto, led the rebellion by three PLN members.

 CUBA: LAGE FORECASTS 5%: GROWTH THIS YEAR

 The country's Vice President Carlos Lage reckons that the economy will 
slowdown after registering a 7% growth rate in the first quarter. He is 
sticking to a forecast of 5% growth for the whole year. 

 Lage said that the economy was boosted in the first half of the year by the 
increase in sugar production. The country just scraped through to  the 4.5m 
tonne target set by the government. In mid-June, with two or three sugar 
mills still grinding, the country had produced 4.45m t of sugar. This year's 
crop though was a big improvement on 1994/95's 3.3m t.

 Lage claimed that the economy grew by 2.5% last year, but the government's 
statistical information is still rudimentary and there are few ways of 
verifying statements made by leading politicians. 

 One of the fastest growing sectors of the economy appears to be the nickel 
industry. The government says that the country will produce a record 50,000t 
of nickel this year. This is a 40% increase on the 1995 figure. The problem 
is that nickel mining does not have much effect on the rest of the economy. 
At most  2,000 people benefit directly from the increase in production. 

 More important is the increase in tourism. Last year 730,000 people visited 
the island (20% more than in 1994) and the government is hoping for 1m 
visitors this year. Also important is the 25% increase in tobacco production 
and the 22% increase in agricultural output.

 The only downbeat part of Lage's report on the state of the economy 
concerned foreign investment. He noted that this had stalled, following the 
decision by the US Congress and then the administration to turn the Helms-
Burton bill into law. This allows the US to take punitive action against 
companies and individuals who have bought assets in Cuba claimed by US 
companies or individuals. Lage said that although new investment had not 
been forthcoming, no companies had yet said they would pull out of Cuba 
because of the law.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS AND FRAUDS: FROM IMPORTER TO EXPORTER

 The country faces a second round of the presidential elections on 30 June. 
The issue is whether the frontrunner in the first round, Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, can hang on and win. Ranged against him is not only the runner-up in 
the first round, Leonel Fernandez, but also the ruling party and the current 
President Joaquin Balaguer whose candidate, Jacinto Peynado, came a poor 
third.

 Balaguer is, apparently, very much against Pena Gomez, largely because Pena 
Gomez is black. Pena Gomez from the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano won 
46% of the votes in the first round, well ahead of the 395 won by Fernandez 
from the Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana. Peynado, from the Partido 
Reformista Social Cristiano, won 16%. 

 Corruption. The Contraloria de la Republica Dominicana revealed that 
800,000 state cheques had been forged, costing the government US Dollars 
47m. The contralor, Victor Grimaldi, pointed out that no official had yet 
been charged or convicted of any crime. The cheques seem to have been issued 
by the Tesoreria Nacional.

 EL SALVADOR: MAKING A GESTURE: BOOSTING PUBLIC WORKS

 The government is still under pressure from industry to take the brakes off 
the economy. The government was obliged to tighten monetary policy last year 
in order to stop credit growing at a destabilising rate and inflation 
getting out of hand. The private sector still reckons that policy is too 
tight. It wants the economy to be growing by at least 6% a year.

 The Camara de Comercio e Industria de El Salvador said that achieving 
stability was not enough: the economy had to also recover its dynamism. In 
1992 and 1993 the economy grew by over 7% a year in real terms. This rate 
dropped to 6% in 1994 and 1995. 

 The government of President Armando Calderon Sol clearly felt that it had 
to at least make a gesture. So at the beginning of June, on its second 
anniversary of accession to office, it announced a US Dollars 114m public 
works programme. 

 Besides this, the President also announced that the tariff reform programme 
would be slowed down: in particular the government says that it will give 
local industry more time before tariffs on consumer goods are lowered.

 The government is still planning to lower tariffs on capital goods to zero 
by the end of the year. Exports are also eligible for a 6% tax refund. 

 Crime. The opposition is linking the problems in the economy with the huge 
increase in crime. Marta Valladares, a leader of the former guerrilla group, 
the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional, claims that there 
were 8,000 murders in the country last year. This was more than the annual 
casualties in most years of the civil war she said. Even some members of the 
ruling Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA party) concede that more 
needs to be done to build up civil society and reduce poverty.

 GUATEMALA: THE RIGHT SURFACES: AS GUERRILLAS DROP TAX

 The hardliners opposed to any peace deal with the guerrilla Unidad 
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca have broken cover. A group of 
landowners, the Coordinadora Nacional Agropecuaria has criticised the 
government for not using the army to break up meetings called by the URNG or 
using soldiers to evict peasants from land they are squatting on.

 Conagro tried to derail the peace agreement last year by protesting against 
concessions offered by the government. Conagro claimed that they were 
unconstitutional but the constitutional court overruled this. 

 The government is pressing on with its programme to get a peace deal in 
place. Officials say that the URNG's commitment not to charge business the 
so-called 'war tax' seems to be holding. Gustavo Porras, president of the 
Comision de Paz, says that the people who seem to be levying the tax appear 
not to be guerrillas, but just common criminals. 

 Army: President Alvaro Arzu said that peace and a smaller army would not 
necessarily mean that the government could cut the military budget and spend 
the money on something else. He said that more mobile armed forces, needed 
to combat drug traffickers and protect forests, were more expensive. He 
noted that although Guatemala's armed forces had fallen from 47,000 to 
32,000, little money had been saved. 

 Strikes: The government is pushing on with its plans to reform the labour 
code which will end the right to strike for people employed in  essential 
public services. 

 Tax: The government reckons that the Impuesto de Solidaridad Extraordinario 
y Temporal should raise US Dollars 21.6m. This is a sort of supertax on 
companies and individuals with earnings of more than US Dollars 8,000 in 
1994/95. The tax is set at 1% for this year and will rise to 1.5% in 1997. 
People who make six monthly payments will get a 10% discount.

 CHILE: CODELCO AND THE COPPER MARKET: LINKS BETWEEN DAVILA AND HAMANAKA

 The Corporacion del Cobre, Chile's state-owned copper mining company, is 
likely to be badly affected by the fall in copper prices following the 
discovery that Yasuo Hamanaka had run up US Dollars 1.8bn in loss-making, 
unauthorised trades over the past 10 years. Codelco  traded heavily with 
Sumitomo, which was one of the few Japanese trading houses not to develop 
mines of its own. Instead it relied on the London Metal Exchange to buy 
stocks of copper to meet its clients needs. Japan, despite being a 
negligible copper producer, has the world's second biggest copper smelting 
industry. Codelco is the world's biggest copper producer. 

 Codelco had reckoned that the copper price would average between US Dollars 
1.15 and US Dollars 1.16 a pound this year. In the week of 24 June the 
copper price slid to just 81 cents a pound before recovering slightly. The 
fear in the copper market is that Sumitomo, which had built up huge stocks 
of copper which it used to try and squeeze the market, will now have be a 
forced seller as its management tries to adjust its position. 

 The fall in copper prices has been dramatic. Last year the price averaged 
US Dollars 1.33 a pound, despite the prospect of new mines coming into 
production this year and weak demand from the industrialised countries. 
Indeed until the second week of June (one week after Sumitomo started its 
investigation into Hamanaka's trading) the average price for the year was US 
Dollars 1.17.

 The Comision Chilena del Cobre reckons that each one cent move in the 
average price of copper costs the country US Dollars 20m a year. 

 Complaints. Juan Villarzu, Codelco's president, blames the LME for allowing 
the problem to arise. He said that the market had become too speculative. He 
wants rules to make speculation more difficult.

 Villarzu's complaint seems to be a case of sour grapes. Codelco did not 
understand what its futures trader, Juan Pablo Davila was up to three years 
ago when he managed to cost the company US Dollars 175m by doing loss-making 
deals with brokers. Indeed it was the brokers who first alerted Codelco to 
the problem. 

 The brokers seem to have acted similarly in Hamanaka's case. Once they 
started to get strange requests from Hamanaka about the way trades should be 
recorded, they went to the LME with their worries. The LME called in 
Sumitomo which did nothing. 

 The LME has also tried to smooth the copper market by increasing the margin 
requirement from its usual US Dollars 200 a tonne to US Dollars 600; given 
the market's recent volatility such an increase seems warranted. It is 
expected that once the current bout of volatility is over the margin will 
fall back to more normal levels.

 That is right. All markets need a mixture of users and speculators. Without 
the strange combination of two hedge funds (Quantum and Tiger) and a 
Montreal scrap dealer, who all started to short copper on 6 June, a day 
after Sumitomo started its investigation into Hamanaka's trading, the false 
market that had developed in copper would not have been revealed. The 
speculators' action increased the pressure on Sumitomo and Hamanaka as their 
losses increased. When they came clean, the speculators appeared to take 
their profits and leave the market to find its own level. 

 Hedging. Unlike gold mining companies which have used gold loans and other 
techniques to hedge their future production, Codelco seems to have spurned 
the idea of hedging. This may be a legacy of Juan Pablo Davila's activities.

 The company was already feeling the effects of the drop in copper prices in 
its first quarter. Despite a 10% increase in production the company's net 
profits fell by 9% to US Dollars 433m. Its operating profits fell even more 
dramatically, from US Dollars 491m to US Dollars 305m.

 CHILE: CORPORATE PROFILE/IANSA & PATHFINDER: QUITE A SUCCESS STORY: 
Developing from sugar into agribusiness

 The Pathfinder group in Chile, whose shareholders were among the pioneers 
of debt equity swaps in the 1980s, has now carved out a reputation as a 
specialist in turning around ailing Chilean companies has turned its 
attention to Iansa, a troubled fruit company. 

 So successful has Iansa become that Forbes, a US business magazine picked 
it as one of the five best run companies in the country. Pathfinder is 
running Iansa as part of Campos Chilenos. It took over Iansa four years ago.

 Failed first privatisation. The company was founded in 1952 by the state 
holding company Corfo. Its core business was producing sugar from sugar 
beet. As sugar prices were controlled by the state and Corfo's objective was 
to increase agricultural production rather than make money, Iansa wracked up 
losses rather than profits. 

 Once the privatisation bug bit the government in Chile, Iansa was clearly a 
prime candidate for divestiture. Instead of selling the whole of the company 
as a going concern, the government decided to sell three of its five sugar 
plants to two companies. Crav bought two and Compania Industrial one. 

 The sales coincided with a surge in the international sugar price: this 
prompted Crav to start speculating on the futures market just as the sugar 
market turned down. Crav went bust in 1981. Compania Industrial soon 
followed suit. 

 This led the Banco de Estado, which had been the major creditor to the two 
companies, to reassemble the group as it had been before the sales with five 
sugar plants.

 Second shot. The government had another go at selling the company between 
1986 and 1988. This time it sold the company partly through the stockmarket 
and in part directly to other companies. The new owners included: Campos 
Chilenos (which was then owned by famers who supplied Iansa with its raw 
materials and the company's employees); Continental Bank from Chicago; 
Sucden, a French commodity trading company; and Soquimich, a Chilean mining 
company.

 The current general manager of the firm, Ernesto Sahr, told the Chilean 
news magazine Que Pasa, that contrary to what people thought, the second 
privatisation did little to improve the viability of the firm. He said that 
conflicts between shareholders unhinged Iansa's management, marketing and 
financial system. 

 Pathfinder's chance. Pathfinder saw its chance and took it at the end of 
1991 by buying Campos Chilenos, Iansa's controlling shareholder. Sahr said 
that immediately the company's fortune's started to improve. Pathfinder 
built up its stake and now controls 43% of Iansa's shares.

 More importantly, Pathfinder also got the company to change its business. 
The company had originally been set up to help national agriculture, in 
particular sugar producers. Under Pathfinder's management, it had two tasks: 
the first was to dominate the local sugar market. The second was to 
diversify away from relying just on sugar for its money. 

 Challenge. Unlike some managers, who might have decided to move the company 
away from sugar almost immediately, Pathfinder decided that Iansa should try 
to dominate the local sugar market before diversifying.

 Dominating the sugar market was more easily said than done. Unlike most 
developing (and developed) countries, Chile does not protect its domestic 
sugar market with high tariffs.

 This meant that Iansa had to grow by becoming more efficient and 
competitive. First it cut costs, streamlined its management and invested in 
new technology to increase productivity. 

 So successful was Iansa that the low price for sugar in Chile has kept 
other companies out of the market. A kilo of sugar in Chile retails at 
around US Dollars 0.50. In the US, by contrast, a kilo of sugar costs US 
Dollars 1.20. 

 The bottom line. Iansa's strategy has not just delivered low-priced sugar 
to Chilean consumers: it has also delivered a spectacular financial 
performance. 

 In 1993, Iansa's profits increased by 425% (to US Dollars 11.5m) compared 
with 1992. But this was almost nothing compared to what happened in 1995 
when the company's profits shot up to US Dollars 48.5m.

 The main reason for the surge in profits in 1994 and 1995 was record sugar 
production in 1994/95. The company produced 550,000t of sugar: this was 20% 
more than it had produced in the previous season.

 Overall, Iansa has increased sales by an average of 18% a year since it was 
taken over by Pathfinder. 

 Diversification. Pathfinder's plan for Iansa is that it should cease to be 
a one product company but evolve into a diversified agro-industrial company. 
Sahr said that the company realised it was dangerous to depend on sugar, 
whose price can vary dramatically on the international market.

 Iansa first dabbled in agricultural supplies before moving into the tomato 
products market, fruit concentrates and animal feed.

 So successful has the diversification strategy been that Iansa has changed 
its corporate structure. Iansa has now become a parent company with five 
subsidiaries: 

 Iansa still runs the sugar side of the business. This consists of the 
original five plants and the sugar business still accounts for 64% of the 
group's sales. Iansa Peru and Insafrut run the fruit and fruit drink side; 
Iansagro looks after the supply of agricultural services and supplies and 
Biomaster deals with animal feed. Each company has a five year plan that 
calls for the whole group to invest US Dollars 230m. 

 Capital. Such a heavy investment programme has prompted the company to try 
and increase its capital. Originally the company announced that it would 
launch an ADR issue at the end of 1995. This issue has been delayed several 
times. 

 The company says it wants to raise about US Dollars 50m. Its international 
advisers have told it to hold off, despite the fact that the market for ADRs 
is buoyant. Instead the company is now planning a US Dollars 80m debt issue 
in the US.

 The company needs the money partly because of its capital expenditure plans 
and partly because it has international ambitions.

 Iansa is planning to add to its five Chilean plants (Curico, Linares, 
Chillan, Los Angeles and La Union) by buying Argentina's third largest sugar 
company (Ingenio San Martin del Tabacal). It is also interested in buying a 
sugar producer in Peru. 

 These acquisitions are in addition to its plans to build a maize syrup 
plant at Curico. Maize syrup is increasingly replacing sugar as the 
sweetener in soft drinks.

 Iansagro. Iansagro, which accounts for 16% of the group's total sales is 
expanding its business which currently revolves around providing 
agricultural services, especially technology, to beet sugar producers. 

 It is beefing up its operations by opening the first supermarket for 
agricultural products in the country. The fist supermarket will cost US 
Dollars 44m and the company expects to eventually roll out the concept 
throughout the country, if the first pilot store proves successful.

 Biomaster. The group's animal feed subsidiary also has ambitious plans. Its 
main business is providing food for sheep, pets and fish under the brands, 
Doko, Dokat, Cosetan, Melazan and Trucha.

 It is investing in a new US Dollars 10m plant to produce sheep food. It is 
also licensing technology from McCauley Bros from the US.

 Inasafrut & Iansa Peru. This part of the group plans to spend US Dollars 
25m this year on expanding its four plants. It also wants to move into the 
frozen food market and investigate the prospects for selling (and producing 
its) products in Brazil, Argentina and Peru.

 Still on track. According to Que Pasa, the company's business is still 
doing well. It pointed out that in the first quarter of the year profits 
increased by 23%.

 REGION: INFLATION

 As we warned last month the financial markets seem to have overreacted to 
some astute new management by the Mexican authorities. The markets paid the 
penalty for this in June when interest rates stopped falling and even backed 
up slightly, and the stockmarket and exchange rate had one of their rockiest 
periods this year. The markets were also rather annoyed that the inflation 
rate for May (at 1.8%, ostensibly a marked improvement on April), was at the 
top end of expectations. The big worry is food prices, which are beginning 
to rise as the effects of the drought start to hit supplies. Even the OECD 
is now reckoning that inflation this year will be 33%. Over the first five 
months of the year the CPI has risen by 13.5%. 

 Venezuela's inflation rate in May was even higher than April's. The 
government, though, does not seem too concerned, reckoning that the rate 
will subside sharply in the second half of the year. The accumulated rate 
for the first five months of the year is 52%. 

 Ecuador's inflation rate dropped into minus territory after hitting almost 
3% in April. In both Argentina and Brazil, inflation seems well under 
control. Argentina's rate for the first five months of the year is actually 
a fall of 0.7%. Brazil's is a modest 5.25%.

 REGION: INTEREST RATES

 After their sharp falls in April and May, cetes yields trod water for most 
of June, hovering around the 28% mark. This means that Mexican interest 
rates are barely positive. As we keep on saying, interest rates are close to 
being negative on independent forecasts (such as the OECD's) for inflation. 
The government is still reckoning on 22% for the year. 

 In Brazil interest rates started to fall quite sharply in June as inflation 
fears were dispelled and the government took a more relaxed view of the 
currency.

 REGION: EXCHANGE RATES

 The Mexican peso had a much rockier month. The currency which had actually 
appreciated against the dollar fell from 7.4 to 7.6 as investors began to 
fret that the US Federal Reserve Board might start to nudge short term 
interest rates higher. The US economy is clearly growing lustily and there 
is some evidence of tightness in some markets. If US short rates start to 
rise, foreign investors are likely to pull money out of riskier emerging 
markets and keep it closer to home where the yields are almost as good. Only 
when US yields are skimpy do they take a punt on emerging markets.

 PERU: PRIVATISATION: OIL SALES START: AND RESIDUAL TELEFONICA SHARES ON 
sale

 The government was delighted when Refinadores del Peru, a consortium headed 
by Spain's biggest oil company, Repsol, along with Yacimientos Petroliferos 
Fiscales from Argentina and Mobil from the US, won the auction for La 
Pampilla, the country's main oil refinery. This was the first substantial 
sale in the controversial privatisation of the assets of the state-owned oil 
company Petroperu.

 Repsol has a 45% stake in Refinadores. The consortium paid US Dollars 181m, 
well above the underbidder's offer (from Marven of Venezuela) of US Dollars 
166m. The minimum price fixed by the state for its 60% stake had been set at 
US Dollars 108m (of which US Dollars 38m could come in the form of debt 
paper). Besides paying the purchase price, Repsol has committed itself to 
investing a further US Dollars 50m and maintaining production at 102,000bpd. 
The company will take control of the refinery in August. 
 According to a former member of the board of Petroperu, Carlos Repetto, La 
Pampilla's accumulated debt at the end of 1995 was US Dollars 450m and this 
is likely to rise to US Dollars 600m by the end of this year. 

 Public sale. Daniel Hokama, the energy and mining minister, hinted that the 
government might sell its residual 40% stake in the La Pampilla refinery to 
the public through the stockmarket. 

 Hokama said that the world price for a refinery of La Pampilla's size was 
US Dollars 300m and the government had got US Dollars 180 for a 60% stake in 
it.  

 Oilfields. Simultaneous with the sale of La Pampilla was the sale of two 
concessions (blocs 8/8X near Talara and bloc 10 in the Amazonian jungle) 
owned by Petroperu. The 8/8X blocs hold 43m barrels of oil and the 
government set a minimum price of US Dollars 75m with a commitment to invest 
a further US Dollars 25m.

 The field was awarded to a consortium headed by Plus Petrol from Argentina 
with smaller stakes held by two Korean companies, Daewoo and Padco and a 
Canadian company, Yukon. The consortium paid US Dollars 142m for the field.  

 The first phase of Petroperu's privatisation occurred in 1992 when 78 of 
its petrol stations were sold and the company was broken up into bits that 
could be sold more easily.

 The parts that remain to be sold are Petrolube, the two main refiners are 
La Pampilla and Talara as well as the other two at Conchan and Iquitos and 
the oil pipeline. The oil pipeline, like the refinery at Iquitos, will be 
offered as a 20-year concession rather than completely sold.

 Telefonica. On 10 June the government then launched its international share 
offering for its residual stake in the telephone company, Telefonica del 
Peru. In February 1994, Telefonica de Espana bought 35% in each of the two 
state telephone companies (Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones and the 
Compania Peruana de Telefonos) for a total of US Dollars 2bn.

 The government's residual offering is designed to raise US Dollars 1.2bn. 
The government hopes to sell 50% of the shares in the US, 35% in Europe and 
the balance in Asia and Latin America.

 The government holds a residual stake of 28.6%, but it only wants to sell 
23% of its shares. It is also embarking on an ambitious programme to boost 
local shareholdings in the company.

 Tell Sid. In the first week of June, before the international marketing 
effort started, 20,000 individual Peruvians placed orders for shares. The 
government had hoped to interest a total of between 60,000 and 80,000 
Peruvians and raise US Dollars 200m. It looks as though these targets will 
be beaten.

 On 10 June, the government started its marketing programme to institutional 
investors in Peru. These investors range from the pension funds to insurance 
companies and  corporate and individual investors who place orders of at 
least 20,000 soles (US Dollars 8,300). The government has pencilled in 
takings of US Dollars 50m from institutional investors.

 The government has high hopes of building on the initial success of the 
telephone sale to promote shareholding to retail investors. Prime minister 
Alberto Pandolfi said he hoped there would be 400,000 individual 
sharehodlers in privatised companies by 1998.

 Proceeds: The Peruvian government said that it had received US Dollars 
4.6bn from privatisation between 1993 until the sale of La Pampilla. In 
addition, the new owners of companies had promised to invest a further US 
Dollars 5bn. The government reckons that it will raise a further US Dollars 
4.6bn from sales this year and next. 

 Fishmeal: Pescaperu, the state-owned fishing company, is selling six 
fishmeal factories and three fishoil refineries for at least US Dollars 40m. 
The company began issuing prospectuses at the end of May. Potential 
purchasers will have to put 40% down but can pay the rest in quarterly 
payments for two and half years plus an interest rate of 2% over six-month 
Libor. 

 Gold: The government says that it will sell the Quicay gold deposit, 
belonging to the state-owned Centromin, in mid-July. The minimum price is US 
Dollars 5m. The deposit holds a minimum of 3m ounces of ore with an average 
gold content of 0.3g a tonne. 

 Shougang: The government is holding talks with the Chinese company which 
bought HierroPeru about investment plans. Shougang has failed to meet the 
terms of the agreement it signed when it bought  HierroPeru in 1993. 
Shougang had promised to invest US Dollars 150m in two years, but did not do 
so by the end of 1995. The government said that it cannot take action 
against Shougang because the contract did not allow for it. Shougang has 
apprently offered to invest US Dollars 300m in a new pellets factory, which 
will also be able to handle copper.

 BRAZIL: CVRD: SOLD AS ONE: SAYS BNDES PRESIDENT

 Luis Carlos Mendoza de Barros, president of the Banco Nacional de 
Desenvolvimento Economico, said the country's biggest mining company, 
Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce, would not be broken up before it was privatised. 
The company, which is currently composed of 40 subsidiaries, is likely to 
fetch around US Dollars 12bn. 

 Mendoza de Barros said the government had now dropped the idea of selling 
the company in parts because so many of its subsidiaries had complementary 
activities.

 He also told the senate committee, before whom he was testifying, that the 
government would ensure CVRD's main rivals and customers in the iron ore 
business would be barred from bidding. CVRD is the world's biggest producer 
of iron ore and Latin America's biggest gold producer. 

 Although mining is its main activity, the company also controls transport 
systems, especially railways, roads and shipping, power stations and is 
involved in the lumbering industry. 

 Cellular: The communications minister, Sergio Motta, announced that the 
state-owned companies offering cellular services would start to be 
privatised from 1997. He said that the companies which used Band A would be 
lumped into between seven and 10 regional groupings and then sold. 

 The minister said that companies bidding for Band B wavelengths in specific 
areas would also have to bid for the local Band A company. 

 He also said the state-owned telecoms company would be privatised by the 
end of President Cardoso's mandate. This ends on 31 December 1998. 

 Maracana: The state government in Rio de Janeiro has put the famous 
Maracana soccer stadium up for sale. It is offering the stadium, which costs 
US Dollars 10m a year to run, on a 30-year concession. It has advertising 
receipts of around US Dollars 7m a year and collects US Dollars 120,000 in 
ticket sales from the derbies between Flemingo and Fluminense. The stadium 
is built to take 180,000 spectators but its capacity has recently been 
limited to 120,000. The state government reckons that the new management 
will have to spend between US Dollars 60m and US Dollars 70m on remodelling 
the stadium which was built in 1950. 

 Light: A consortium headed by Electricite de France in partnership with AES 
and Houston Power Industries bought control of Light, the electricity 
distribution company for the state of Rio de Janeiro. The government sold 
60% of the shares for US Dollars 2.2bn, the minimum set by the government. 
The consortium bought a 34% stake while 20% was bought by Brazilian groups 
and 6% was left unsold. 

 The government must be relieved to have sold Light. It had tried to sell it 
three times previously, but had been thwarted by potential investors' 
worries about litigation over the way the company adjusted bills in the era 
of hyper-inflation. 

 Initially the company was valued at US Dollars 3.7bn. Even at the new 
price, potential bidders, notably Chilectra, thought the price was too high 
for 60% of the shares in the company. 

 Telecoms: The Americas Telecom 96 trade fair in Rio de Janeiro has drawn 
360 equipment manufacturers. This is a substantial increase on the numbers 
attending the two previous fairs in 1988 and 1992, and organisers say this 
reflects the increased international interest in the industry in the region.

 Brazil's telecoms market, which becomes properly free in 1998, is worth 
around US Dollars 30bn a year. Thanks to a constitutional amendment passed 
last year, foreign companies will now be allowed to supply services such as 
cellular phones. Previously the state had a monopoly.

 According to the Union Internacional de Telecomunicaciones, which organises 
the trade fair, Brazil will go from having 14m conventional telephones and 
2m cellular phones in 1995 to 40m conventional telephones and 17m cellular 
phones by 2003. 

 In Argentina, where the privatisation of telecommunications is virtually 
concluded, the country has 20 lines per 100 people. In Brazil the figure is 
12.

 Venezuela: Elia Ynati, president of the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana, 
said that the aluminium industry would be put up for sale in November. He 
said that three companies had already expressed an interest in buying the 
companies in which the CVG is the principal shareholder. The state-owned 
aluminium companies have debts of US Dollars 1.3bn, of which about half is 
owed to foreign banks.

 El Salvador: Morgan Stanley and Citibank have won the contract to advise 
the government on the sale of the telecoms company, Administracion Nacional 
de Telecomunicaciones (Antel). The government has agreed a fee of 0.74% with 
the two banks, which will design and market the privatisation. The sale is 
controversial since the company is profitable and its 6,000 workers say 
their jobs are at risk if the company is privatised.

 Mexico: The government has been forced to delay its sale of the 
petrochemical plants. The delay has been caused by a range of factors: legal 
conflicts, pressure from the opposition and from oilworkers. The government 
had hoped to raise US Dollars 2bn from the sale of the petrochemicals 
industry.

 Privatisation under the current administration has been slow: only the four 
port terminals have been sold for US Dollars 165m. 

 The government is now trying to drum up interest in the railways. There are 
32 foreign companies interested in buying bits of the system which loses 
around US Dollars 140m a year.

 Paraguay: The IMF's managing director met trade unionists who said that he 
believed privatisation should be more flexible. Unions had held a general 
strike to protest against the sale of the steel company, Acepar. The 
government, which has sold only two state companies to date, is currently 
trying to sell the Flota Mercante Paraguaya.

 MEXICO: DEBT PAGE:PREPAYING THE US: US DOLLARS 4.7BN

 Mexico has prepaid almost half the money it borrowed from the US ahead of 
schedule. On 19 June the government announced that it had prepaid US Dollars 
4.7bn the previous day. 

 The Mexican government borrowed a total of US Dollars 12.5bn from the US. 
The US had offered a credit line of up to US Dollars 20bn.

 The Mexican government said that it had borrowed some of the money it used 
to repay the US from a syndicate of international banks headed by JP Morgan 
and Swiss Bank Corporation. The Mexican government said that the new loan 
was significantly cheaper than the money provided by the US and also had a 
longer maturity: 10 years instead of three and a half. Mexican officials 
reckoned that refinancing the loans from the US Treasury will save the 
country around US Dollars 50m a year in interest payments. 

 Over the first five months of the year Mexico has been a heavy borrower 
from the international capital markets. It has borrowed a total of US 
Dollars 7.4bn, bankers say.

 Mexico's total debt at the end of the first quarter was US Dollars 172bn. 
On some calculations Mexico's foreign  debt service burden this year is the 
equivalent of 14.5% of GDP. In 1995 it was 9.5% and in 1994 6%. 

 Eugenia Correa, a researcher at the economics faculty at the Universidad 
Autonoma de Mexico, reckons that the equivalent of 24% of GDP is being spent 
on sorting out the country's debt problems. This takes into account bank 
debts, domestic debt, and foreign debt. In dollar terms, she claims that 
this figure is US Dollars 73bn.

 Oil security. The new money does apparently have a hidden cost. Just as the 
US loan was secured against Mexican oil receipts so is (reportedly) the JP 
Morgan/Swiss Bank Corporation deal. Until the US-led rescue package last 
year, Mexico had refused to pledge its oil receipts. 

 The Mexican government though claims that there is no pledge over oil 
receipts and that the loan in fact gives Mexico greater freedom to use its 
oil revenues. 

 Cuba: The Cuban government is the latest in the region to admit that it 
needs to do something about its foreign debt. It owes US Dollars 9bn. Unlike 
other countries in the region Cuba is not a member of the IDB, the IMF or 
the World Bank and therefore does not have access to cheap credit to help to 
set up a debt reduction deal. 

 According to figures issued by the Banco Nacional de Cuba, the country's 
foreign debt at the end of 1995 stood at US Dollars 9.1bn, or US Dollars 
500m more than at the end of 1994. 

 Although European countries  account for the bulk of the country's debt, 
Argentina is also a major creditor, owed US Dollars 1.3bn. According to 
central bank officials, the US Dollars 9bn figure does not include the 
country's debts to the former Soviet Union and other Comecon countries. 
These debts are said to be large and unquantifiable. 

 Cuba stopped paying its foreign dent in 1986 as part of a campaign led by 
Fidel Castro to protest against the high cost of servicing foreign debts. 

 Cuba is now trying to build bridges with its creditors. It has held talks 
with banks and banking authorities in Japan, Spain, France and Britain. 
Bankers say that the talks have been wide ranging, including ideas such as 
debtswaps. 

 Cuba's inability to tap the international capital markets means that it has 
been forced into short term loans to finance its sugar crop. It is said to 
have borrowed US Dollars 300m to finance the 1995/96 crop which has barely 
hit the production target of 4.5m t. The danger of missing the target is 
that Cuba will be unable to sell as much sugar as it hoped on the 
international market. It has swaps with China and Russia to satisfy first. 

 Honduras: Eduardo Villanueva, fiscal for cultural affairs, claims that 
according to some optimistic researchers, the San Roque galleon which sank 
off Honduras in 1606 has enough gold and silver on it to clear the country's 
foreign debt. He said that the country should take special care of these 
rich shipwrecks. The San Roque was the flagship of a treasure fleet and 
apparently held 180 boxes of gold and silver coins; 250 silver bars and 100 
gold bars. The government says that it has located the site of the wreck. 
The site is believed to be close to the Bay Islands. 

 IDB: The IDB has made its first ever loan to the private sector to help 
finance a 2,180 metre tunnel through the El Corvocado mountain in Rio de 
Janeiro. The borrower is OAS, which has won the concession for a 15km 
Amarelo underground line.

 HONDURAS: THE GRAINS PROBLEM: FROM EXPORTER TO IMPORTER

 The President, Roberto Reina, has approved an emergency plan to deal with 
the scarcity of staple grains. The core of the plan involves setting up a 
committee, headed by Guatama Fonsea, a member of congress for the ruling 
Partido Liberal.  

 The country has had problems with growing its own staple foods for the past 
couple of years, following  changes introduced by the previous government of 
Rafael Callejas which its opponents say encouraged local producers to export 
rather than sell in the local market. Last year the harvest increased by 
1.9% but demand grew by 3.5%, the government said. The grains tend to go to 
neighbouring countries (El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) where local 
prices are higher than those in the Honduran market. 

 Already the government has had to import 1,500t of beans (at a cost of US 
Dollars 1m) from Canada. The government has set aside US Dollars 5m to buy 
staples (beans, maize and wheat) from international markets. 

 Maquila. The government and the textile industry is beefing up its campaign 
to stop the US penalising goods made in Honduras because of the bleak labour 
conditions at textile factories in Honduras. Last month it sent a mission to 
testify to the US Senate headed by the economy minister, Fernando Garcia and 
Cecilio Zavala, the labour minister.

 Honduran industrialists say that Charles Keraghan, head of the human rights 
committee of the National Labor Commission is behind the lurid, usually 
televised, 'investigative' programmes about textile maquilas in Honduras and 
the rest of Central America. Textile producers in the region claim that the 
US textile industry, which just wants to use maquilas for bits of the 
clothes-making process, is behind the campaign. They say that the US 
industry wants to prevent a textile industry, using non-US raw materials, 
developing in Central America. 

 The industry is important. It employs between 60,000 and 70,000 people, 
mostly in Korean and Taiwanese factories around San Pedro Sula in the north 
of the country. Textile exports were worth US Dollars 186m to Honduras last 
year and are likely to grow to US Dollars 220m this year.

 NICARAGUA: INFLATION PICKS UP: BUT ECONOMY ON COURSE, ACCORDING TO CENTRAL 
bank

 The president of the central bank, Evenor Taboada, said that although 
inflation picked up in May, the economy was doing rather well. He said that 
the government had more than met the targets it set itself of increasing 
reserves, increasing public sector deposits at the central bank and getting 
the private banks to finance this year's crop. 

 Taboada blamed the increase in inflation on an increase in the price of 
perishables. This pressure would ebb, he said, in the second half of the 
year.

 The pressure here will come from the politicians as the country gears up 
for the presidential elections scheduled for 20 October. It now seems likely 
that all 22 candidates will be ruled eligible by the Consejo Supremo 
Electoral: there had been allegations of unfitness made against five of 
them, including three of the key candidates, Arnoldo Aleman, the former 
mayor of Managua, Daniel Ortega, the former Sandinista president and Antonio 
Lacayo, the current President's son-in-law. Opinion polls suggest Aleman is 
currently leading.

 PANAMA: GROWTH STEADY: BUT SHRIMPS IMPROVE

 The economy grew by 3% in the first quarter of this year, but most 
independent economists expect the rate to fall back to between 1% and 2% for 
the year, because of the complicated political situation. 

 Economic statistics in the country are easily distorted: bananas account 
for half of the country's total agricultural output. Exports for the first 
four months of the year were 11.6m boxes, up 2.7% on the same period of 
1995. Meat production is just holding its own: in the first three months of 
the year 70,126 head of cattle were slaughtered. This was virtually the same 
number as in the first quarter of 1995. Shrimp production on the other hand 
is doing well. In the first two months of the year it was 13% up on the same 
period of 1995. 

 Although the consumption of electricity in the first quarter at 956m KW 
hours was 9% above the level for the same period of 1995, the industrial 
consumption index, at 128, was only two points above the level of the 
previous year. Construction, though, seems to be doing well. The issuance of 
licences was worth US Dollars 77m in the first quarter: that is 10% more 
than for the first quarter of 1995. 

 Canal traffic was also healthy in the first quarter. It was 57.8m t or 5.3% 
more than for the same period of 1995. The free-zone in Colon though is 
seeing lower volumes of re-exports. 

 What is depressing, though, is retail sales. At US Dollars 212m for the 
first two months of the year, these were 13% below 1995's figures. Tourism 
on the other hand was up by 50% at 72,000.

 The government is running a growing deficit. Spending in February was 26% 
up on the comparable month of 1995 at US Dollars 267m. Revenues were 2% up 
at US Dollars 210m.

 Although unemployment remains comparatively high at 14% (for February) this 
actually represents an improvement on the figure for the comparable months 
of 1995.

 PARAGUAY: DEFICIT PROBLEM: WARNS IMF

 The IMF says that the government must take action to lower the fiscal 
deficit if the country's economic prospects are to improve. The Fund says 
that it fears a renewed upsurge in inflation in Paraguay if the public 
sector deficit is not brought under cotrol swiftly.

 The Fund reckons that dealing with the problem should not be too difficult. 
It says that the increase in public spending this year is largely due to 
higher personnel costs. According to the fund, the public sector's personnel 
costs have doubled over the past six years and amounted to 8.5% of GDP in 
1995.

 The Fund also notes that some of the increase in public spending has been 
due to sorting out the financial system. It reckons that the bulk of the 
money has now been spent and that the recently approved banking law should 
start to settle things down again.

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: WRITING OFF: MOST OF THE LOANS TO GUYANA

 The government has decided, to the fury of the opposition, to write off 
most of the US Dollars 536m debt Guyana has run up with Trinidad & Tobago. 
The government has decided to write off US Dollars 357m and reschedule 
repayment of the remaining US Dollars 179m over 23 years. 

 Keith Rowley, from the opposition People's National Movement says that the 
write off is unnecessary: he would have preferred the debt to have been 
swapped for some of Guyana's forestry, rice fields or gold mining 
concessions.

 The government said that it was bound by the terms of the Paris Club 
meeting which it attended (and where it found itself to be Guyana's biggest 
creditor, above the US, Britain, Holland, Germany, France, Norway and 
Denmark). Trinidad started to lend large amounts to Guyana in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s when it was flush with oil revenues. 

 Neal & Massy. The stockmarket was surprised at the end of May at the 
decision by Neal and Massy's management to take provisions of T&T Dollars 
100m against a restructuring of the conglomerate. The company is closing or 
selling most of its lossmaking divisions to raise money to reduce 
borrowings.

 The company which is a major conglomerate operating in both Trinidad and 
Jamaica, has been under pressure for the past three years since it bought T. 
Geddes Grant. Stockbrokers say that it failed to integrate this company 
(which had companies in several of Neal and Massy's businesses) and allowed 
debt to balloon to nearly T&T Dollars 800m.

 URUGUAY: CONSTRUCTION PLANS: AND SCANDALS

 The president of the Camara de la Construcccion de Uruguay, Ignacio Otegui, 
has asked the government to take measures to reduce the red-tape which he 
says is preventing the industry from recovering. The construction industry, 
traditionally one of the engines of the economy, has been in recession for 
the past 18 months or so. 

 In 1995 the construction industry contracted by 15% as Argentine investment 
in Uruguay dried up. Since the end of the year the industry has continued to 
decline, throwing around 1,500 people out of work a month. 

 Otegui wants the government just to get on with the projects that have been 
already authorised. He said that announcing new projects or increased 
investment would not be as helpful as simply signing contracts and getting 
authorised projects moving.

 Otegui said that currently the industry reckons that it takes between eight 
and 12 months for prices, tendering systems and subcontracting arrangements 
to be agreed on projects for the public sector. 

 Inflation: In May prices rose by 2.1%, bringing the figure for the first 
five months of the year to 10.8%. More encouraging is the wholesale price 
index. It rose by just 1% in May and is currently registering 26% for the 
past 12 months. Although farm food prices fell by almost 2% as meat and wool 
prices dropped, processed food prices actually rose. This reflects the 
increase in grain and oilseeds prices. 

 Opinion polls: Support for President Julio Maria Sanguinetti hit a new low 
in May, according to a poll for the daily El Observador. It found that only 
18% of Uruguayans thought he was doing well, while 50% thought he was doing 
a poor job. The main criticism of his policies was economic: respondents 
complained of not being able to find jobs and of the sharp increases in 
prices. 

 Scandal: Ramifications from the Focoex scandal seem to be spreading. At the 
heart of the scandal are allegations that members of the former Lacalle 
government misused a US Dollars 200m line of credit from Spain to pay 
extortionate prices for basic goods. A congressional committee has already 
been set up to investigate the accusations which are being led by Leonardo 
Nicolini from the left wing opposition, the Frente Amplio. He has already 
suffered counter-suits for libel and damages from those he has accused of 
corruption.

 The allegations of corruption started nine months ago. The latest people to 
be tarred by the allegations are a former presidential secretary, Pablo 
Garcia Pintos, a former president of Obras Sanitarias del Estado, Villanueva 
Saravia, a former transport minister (who is currently a member of congress) 
Juan Carlos Raffo, and a former economy minister and central bank president, 
Enrique Braga. Braga has already disproved allegations that there were 
irregularities in the way a bank was sold during his time in office.

 BRAZIL: COFFEE: WHY THE DROP IN EXPORTS MAY BE STRUCTURAL: RATHER THAN JUST 
temporary

 The world's biggest coffee producer, Brazil, reports that its coffee 
exports in the first four months of the year were the lowest for five years 
at 2.27m bags. This was 37.5% down on the comparable period of 1995.

 Most analysts attribute the fall to the problems caused by the frosts in 
the winter of 1994. These cut the crop in 1994/1995 to 12.5m bags and the 
1995/1996 crop to 14m bags. The expectation though is for a much bigger crop 
in 1996/97, which is currently on the trees. 

 The official forecast is for a crop of 28m bags. Independent analysts go 
for 25m bags. 

 Important though the frost damage is, it could be masking a structural 
change in the Brazilian coffee industry. As Oswaldo Aranha, president of the 
Federacao Brasileira dos Exportadores do Cafe, said, another reason for the 
fall in Brazilian exports has been that domestic prices for coffee are now 
higher than the international price. This has led, he said, to a shift from 
exports to the domestic market. 

 Indeed the domestic market is recovering strongly. In 1995, thanks to the 
real plan which helped restore Brazilians' purchasing power, domestic 
consumption of coffee increased by 9%. This bucked the world trend of lower 
coffee consumption. 

 In 1995 world demand for coffee dropped from 96.6m (60kg) bags to 93.2m. In 
the US, the world's biggest consumer, coffee consumption dropped by 6%.

 Interestingly, the increase in Brazilian consumption is not a one-off. 
Consumption has been growing steadily since it fell to 2.3kg a head in 1980. 
A decade earlier it had been 4.6kg. In 1995 consumption was just under 3kg a 
head. US consumption is 4kg a head. 

 If the current trend continues in Brazil, the domestic coffee market could 
be using about 15m bags a year by the end of century, up from its current 
consumption of 10m bags. Even now coffee traders say that Brazil might have 
to import more coffee to meet domestic demand since the 14m bag (1995/96) 
crop plus the 7m bags in store will not be enough to both meet export 
commitments and keep the domestic market supplied. 

 The Asociacao Brasileira de la Industria do Cafe reckons that if domestic 
consumption does increase to 15m bags a year, the country's coffee crop will 
have to be 35m bags. 

 Exports. The dismal figure for exports in April, (512,468 bags) meant that 
Brazil's exports have now been below 1m bags for seven months in a row.

 The country has exported only half of its quota granted by the Association 
of Coffee Producing Countries. The quota is supposed to compel countries to 
hold back 20% of their production from the market in an effort to drive up 
international prices.

 The fall in export volumes (and the weak international price) has 
diminished export revenues. In April, revenues were a mere US Dollars 82m 
compared with US Dollars 185m in April 1995. In the first four months of the 
year export revenues were US Dollars 331m, compared with US Dollars 641m in 
the same period of 1995. 

 Colombia: The Colombian coffee crop has been badly damaged by heavy rains. 
The Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros now says that the country expects a 
crop of 10.6m bags for the year starting in June 1996. Originally Colombia 
had forecast a crop of 12.5m bags.

 In 1995, the country exported 9.8m bags, 17% less than in 1994. Revenues 
were US Dollars 1.9bn. 

 Mexico: The country now expects a crop of 4.7m bags. It says that it will 
export 3.8m to North America.

 Honduras: Although the Instituto Hondureno del Cafe expects the 1995/96 
crop to have increased from 2.5m (40kg) bags to 3.2m it does not expect 
revenues to follow suit. In fact it expects them to fall from last year's US 
Dollars 320m to around US Dollars 300m. 

 Nicaragua: Alvaro Velazquez, from the Comision Nicarag***uense del Cafe 
says that the country should be able to sell all of its exportable coffee 
from the next (1996/97) crop. He expects the country to harvest 792,000 
(60kg) bags and to be able to export 707,100 (60kg) bags. He says that the 
quota given by the ACPC was equal to total production. At current prices 
that volume of exports would produce US Dollars 110m in revenues. 

 Dominican Republic: The country expects to export 574,752 (40kg) bags in 
1995/96. This will earn around US Dollars 56m according to Jose Antonio 
Martinez from the Comision Nacional del Cafe at the agriculture ministry.

 Quotas: Brazil has been awarded a quota of 15m bags by the ACPC for the 
year starting in July 1996. Colombia has a quota of 10.65m bags. The ACPC is 
trying to get both Mexico and Guatemala to sign up. On 15 June, Central 
America, Ecuador and Colombia asked for their quotas to be modified. They 
want to move 254,000 bags from the first to the second half of the year. 
Colombia wants to move 100,000 bags from the final quarter of this year to 
the first of next year in order to match its production to its quota.

 Ecuador: The country's coffee revenues more than halved in the first four 
months of 1996, compared with the same period of 1995. They dropped from US 
Dollars 46m to US Dollars 22m. The fall in coffee revenues was paralleled by 
falls in revenues from oil, wood and shrimps. Yet overall the country's 
export revenues rose in the first four months of the year to US Dollars 
1.46bn from US Dollars 1.44bn in the same period of 1995. The main increase 
was in manufactures, which rose from US Dollars 267m in the first third of 
1995 to US Dollars 309m in the same period of 1996.

 ARGENTINA: AGRICULTURE: ON THE UP: LAND PRICES JUMP BY 30%

 Falling grain production in the US and a drop in supplies from the EU 
coupled with increased demand from Asia has led to a jump in land prices in 
Argentina. Land agents say that the price of arable land has jumped by 
between 30% and 50% over the past eight months.

 According to land agents the price of land suitable for wheat in the 
province of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe and Cordoba) has jumped from 
between US Dollars 1,000 and US Dollars 1,500 a hectare eight months ago to 
US Dollars 2,500 and US Dollars 3,500 now. Rents have also increased: they 
have gone up from US Dollars 100 a month in the Pampas to US Dollars 150. 

 The increase in prices follows the surge in wheat prices: these have gone 
from US Dollars 150 a tonne in May 1995 to just under US Dollars 200. 
Meanwhile maize prices have jumped from US Dollars 100 to US Dollars 172 a 
tonne. Soya has also jumped from an average of US Dollars 190 a tonne to US 
Dollars 275. 

 Raquel Camino, from the Centro de la Industria Aceitera de Argentina says 
that the increase in land prices reflects the effect of the Uruguay round 
which has cut the export subsidies farmers in the US and the EU used to 
enjoy. Coupled with poor weather (notably drought in the US), prices have 
risen sharply. 

 Even the beef crisis in Europe has helped to increase grain prices. Poultry 
and pigs eat more maize and soya than cows.

 Argentine officials expect the country to harvest 60m t of grain this year 
and export revenues to top US Dollars 7.5bn. Of these US Dollars 5bn will 
come from the export of oilseeds (principally soya and sunflowers).

 Some investors have already done well. George Soros, the man who forced 
sterling out of the EMS and whose aggressive shorting of the copper market 
may have prompted Sumitomo to crystallise a US Dollars 1.8bn loss, bought 
350,000 hectares of Argentine land 18 months ago. 

 The government says that the strong grain prices have led to increased 
demand for fertilisers and agricultural machinery.

 Downside. The downside to the delight of arable farmers is the grim 
position of stock farmers. They have been hit by the worldwide fall in 
demand for beef following the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) scare 
in Europe.  

 This problem with BSE has offset the benefits Argentina has won by being 
declared free of foot-and-mouth disease, which had limited its exports. 

 Humberto Volando, president of the Federacion Agraria Argentina, the forum 
for small farmers, said that lots of small farmers were getting rid of their 
animals and switching to growing crops. 

 Wool: Sheep farmers in the south of Argentina say that the country's wool 
production will drop by 30% because of the effect of a drought. 

 Bananas: Banana revenues in the first four months of the year increased to 
US Dollars 317m from US Dollars 308m in the same period if 1995. Export 
volumes fell by 6% (compared with April 1995) to 349,160t. Revenues in April 
though were up from US Dollars 79m to US Dollars 84m.   

 Fishing: The Chilean government has reaffirmed its support for the New York 
Agreement on deep sea rights. Chile has the world's fourth biggest fishing 
industry and the sector's exports last year were worth US Dollars 1.7bn. Of 
that 88% was generated by fishmeal. The agreement will give Chile the right 
to vet deep sea fishing vessels which catch fish that generally come inside 
Chile's 200 mile limit. 

 Fishing industry executives are less keen on the agreement because in 
return for the right to vet vessels outside the 200 mile zone, Chile will 
lose exclusive rights over its own zone. It will also come under pressure to 
allow foreign vessels to use its ports. 

 Chile has already taken a strong line on factory ships fishing for horse 
mackerel and hake. The number of such ships has been cut from 120 in 1991 to 
just 18 now, thanks to its licensing system. 

 Sugar: The Cuban sugar crop is still creeping towards the official target 
of 4.5m t. At the end of May production stood at 4.4m t. The government said 
that it was happy to have increased production by a third and has set a 
target of 5m t for 1996/97. Officials say financing for this crop has 
already been arranged: this will allow increased imports of fertilisers and 
other inputs. President Fidel Castro said that the country had borrowed US 
Dollars 300m for the last harvest and had to pay an interest  bill of US 
Dollars 50m for the privilege.

 MEXICO: OIL: PRODUCTION UP BY 7% IN FIRST THIRD: EXPORT PRICES INCREASED

 The state oil company, Pemex, reported that its production in the first 
four months of the year was 6.5% higher than for the same period of 1995. 
The company said that it produced an average of 2.79m bpd of oil. 

 The company said that its average production of heavy oil was 1.34m bpd 
while production of light Isthmus oil ran at 922,000bpd and extra light 
Olmeca at 582,000bpd.

 The country's main oilfield remains the Campeche Basin. It accounted for 
2.06m bpd of the total production. The southern production area (Tabasco and 
Chiapas) generated 634,000bpd while the northern production area produced 
96,000bpd. 

 Exports. The company said that its exports averaged 1.5m bpd. average daily 
exports were 837,400bpd of heavy Maya crude; 185,800bpd of Isthmus and 
480,300bpd of Olmeca. 

 At the beginning of June, the company increased the price of its oil sold 
in the US and Europe but reduced the price of its heavy crude exported to 
the Far East. 

 One constraint on exports, according to Cristian Javelly, the deputy 
manager for international marketing at Pemex, is the company's shortage of 
storage capacity. He said that the company would build two natural gas 
storage facilities in the south of the country.

 Gas. Pemex's gas production in the first third of the year was 4.247bn 
cubic feet a day. This was 17% up on the same period of 1995. The bulk of 
the gas production was in the southern production area which produced 2bn 
cubic feet a day. The Sonda de Campeche produced 1.5bn cubic feet a day 
while the northern zone produced 609m cubic feet a day.

 Politics. The clericalist opposition party, the Partido Accion Nacional, is 
putting pressure on the government to take a tough line on offshore oil 
reserves in the north of the Gulf of Mexico. The PAN wants the government to 
declare that its territorial waters extend for 200 miles. 

 The issue has suddenly become important because Shell, Amoco, Mobil and 
Texaco have all started to drill exploratory wells in an area that could be 
claimed by Mexico. The foreign ministry is playing down the issue saying 
that the wells appear to lie beyond Mexican territorial waters, though they 
could be tapping Mexican oilfields.

 The issue of territorial waters has been left on the back burner since 
1976, when the US Senate refused to recognise Mexico's decision to increase 
its territorial waters to 200 miles. This issue has now become tricky 
because studies by Shell and the other oil companies reckon that the dispute 
area could hold between 5bn and 22bn barrels of oil and 45 trillion cubic 
feet of natural gas.

 A PAN senator, Angel Conchelo, said that Mexico could be entitled to 75% of 
this oil. The fact that the oil companies are drilling to depths of 7,625ft, 
suggests that they may well be tapping into fields which lie predominantly 
in Mexican territory. 

 Tabasco: The government has said that only 9% of the left-wing opposition 
Partido de la Revolucion Democratica's claims of environmental damage done 
by the oil industry in Tabasco are true. The PRD had lodged 19,766 protests. 

 The protests had led to the blockading of 20 oil wells in January and 
February. In order to end the unrest both the government and the PRD agreed 
to abide by the judgment of a committee composed of officials from the 
energy, environment, agriculture, agricultural reform and communications 
ministries and the Comision Nacional del Agua and the Procuraduria Federal 
de Proteccion al Ambiente y los Asuntos Agarios.

 The government has yet to say what action it will take over the protests it 
considers to be justified.

 PERU: GAS: CAMISEA: BACK ON

 The government says that it has reached an agreement with Shell and Mobil 
to develop the Camisea gas deposit. This was discovered by Shell in 1983, 
but its development has been in abeyance since then because of its 
remoteness and the previous government's hostility to foreign investment. 

 Some points of the deal remain unclear. The foreign companies will invest 
between US Dollars 2.7bn and US Dollars 2.8bn to develop the deposit. Their 
concession will last for 40 years.

 What is still not clear is what will happen to the gas. The Peruvian 
government says that the country will now become a net hydrocarbons 
exporter. Yet Shell is not absolutely committed to building a gas pipeline, 
either to Lima or to Bolivia to connect to the Bolivian-Brazilian natural 
gas pipeline. Indeed the Shell-Mobil consortium is only committed to 
spending US Dollars 200m over the next two years to drill three exploratory 
wells. The development phase of the project only starts in 1998 and is 
budgeted at US Dollars 2.5bn. Yet without a pipeline, it is hard to see the 
foreign companies investing such amounts.  

 Camisea contains, according to official figures, 12.2bn cubic feet of 
natural gas and 610m barrels of gas liquids. This is worth, oilmen say, 
about US Dollars 70bn. 

 Camisea's oil reserves are equivalent to 2.2bn barrels, or seven times 
Peru's current reserves.
Output. The country's oil output in May, at 3.7m barrels (119,345bpd), was 
6% below the figure for May 1995. Overall in the first five months of the 
year production was 5% down on the same period of 1995 at 17.9m (or 
117,763bpd). Occidental is the biggest single oil producer in Peru 
contributing 1.66m barrels. It is followed by the recently sold bloc 8 which 
pumped 776,841 barrels. 

 Gas production is also down in the first five months at 3,758m cubic feet. 
This is 7.4% down on the same period of 1995.

 ECUADOR: OIL: HOLDING STEADY: BUT NO EFFECT FROM HIGHER PRICES

 Ecuador has not benefitted from the higher-than-expected oil prices in the 
first half of the year. In the first four months of the year, its oil export 
revenues actually fell, though by only US Dollars 2m to US Dollars 464m. 

 This was despite a 4% increase in oil production in the first quarter of 
the year to 35.4m barrels (389,000bpd). Petroecuador, the state oil company, 
produces 81% of the country's oil. Around 60% of Ecuador's oil production is 
exported. 

 The only month which seemed to have benefitted from the higher price was 
March where revenues reached US Dollars 124m, the highest since October 
1995. 

 The government announced that it would invest US Dollars 418m in the 
modernisation of the oil industry. Of this US Dollars 100m will go on 
increasing the capacity of the main TransEcuadorean pipeline from 350,000bpd 
to 380,000bpd. 

 The expansion of the Esmeraldas oil refinery (from 90,000bpd to 110,000bpd) 
will cost US Dollars 180m. Of that US Dollars 77m will be spent in the 
current year.

 The government is also spending US Dollars 2m on producing unleaded fuel. 
It reckons that this investment should be enough to meet the entire domestic 
demand. 

 The government is also embarking upon a US Dollars 72m project to increase 
gas production from the Amazon fields. The government has also agreed a deal 
with Energy Development Corporation for the exploration and production of 
gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil. The country has been trying to do such a deal 
to develop the gas resources in the Gulf for 25 years. 

 EDC is committed to spend US Dollars 45m over four years to explore for 
gas. The government offered a concession to a consortium in 1968 but this 
was suspended in 1972. Northwest Energy was awarded a concession in 1974 but 
this lapsed after five years when the government reckoned that Northwest had 
not met the terms of the contract. BHP King Ranch thought it had won a 
concession in 1995, but this was struck out by the Consejo para la 
Evaluacion de Licitaciones.  

 Court case: The Frente de la Defensa de la Amazonia has warned President 
Sixto Duran-Ballen to stay out of the court case it has started in New York 
against Texaco. The Frente is suing Texaco for the environmental damage it 
is alleged to have done to the Amazon during the period it produced oil 
there. 

 Texaco has told the court that the Ecuadorean government does not believe 
that it damaged the environment. The judge has asked the Ecuadorean 
government whether this is so: it has yet to reply, but if it supports 
Texaco, the judge says that he would be minded to throw out the case. 

 Last year Texaco promised the government that it would clean up the Amazon 
areas in which it had been operating. The Frente (and other independent 
organisations such as Greenpeace) say that the work Texaco has promised to 
do will not make-up for the environmental damage it has wrought.  

 The Frente initially sought US Dollars 1.5bn in damages, but it has now 
dropped this to US Dollars 800m. 

 Bolivia: Hydrocarbon production increased by 12% in the first quarter to 
30,131bpd, according to the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica. The INE said 
that the country's total production in 1995 was 2.43m barrels (which was 
enough to meet domestic demand). This year it is forecasting that production 
will increase to 2.74m barrels.

 The INE also noted that production from fields operated by the state oil 
company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, fell by 9% to an 
average of 18,570bpd. The Vibora field in the north of the country is the 
YPFB's most productive field, producing 5,321bpd. 

 The good news is that private contractors increased their output by 77% in 
the first quarter to 11,561bpd. The biggest oilfield in the country, Surubi, 
which is operated by Maxus, a subsidiary of Argentina's YPF. This field 
produced 9,335bpd.   

 Venezuela: Congress has approved the contracts won by the successful 
bidders in the January auction for deep fields of light and medium crudes. 
The winning groups (LAEB 03 96 p24) had paid US Dollars 245m in bonds at the 
time of the auction. The contracts, which will be on a joint-venture basis, 
signal the end of 20 years of state control of the oil industry. The new 
fields are reckoned to hold 17bn barrels of crude. 
  The Ministerio de Energia y Minas said that the average price for its oil 
exports was US Dollars 16.7 a barrel in the first five months of the year. 
The average price in the first half of June was down to US Dollars 16.3 a 
barrel. Officials expects quite a sharp decline (to an average of US Dollars 
14 a barrel) over the next three months as the embargo on Iraqi exports 
ends. 

 Paraguay: A US oil company, Phillips Petroleum, has ended its search for 
oil in the country. It drilled two dry holes and spent US Dollars 15m. Over 
the last 50 years fifty oil wells have been drilled in the country without 
finding significant amounts of oil.

 REGION: COPPER: PRICE PROBLEMS: TURMOIL ON THE LME

 The wild gyrations of the copper price on the London Metal Exchange are 
likely to have major effects on Latin America's two biggest copper 
producers, Chile and Peru. Over the past month the price of copper has 
dropped from US Dollars 2,800 a tonne (US Dollars 1.27 a pound) to US 
Dollars 1,900 a tonne (or US Dollars 0.86 a pound) before recovering to US 
Dollars 2,300 a tonne (or US Dollars 1.04 a pound). 

 We have been bears of copper for the past 18 months, though we did not 
expect the collapse in the market to be so sudden. We had expected a gentle 
glide down from last year's peaks to around US Dollars 1.10 a pound by the 
end of the year. 

 No-one seems entirely sure why the copper market has tumbled so far so 
fast. The two main reasons advanced by traders and analysts are (1) that 
China has held off from the market and (2) that Sumitomo Corporation from 
Japan, a major copper holder, might be about to change its policy.

 China is both a major producer and consumer of copper. Traders had been 
expecting it to start buying copper in order to meet the demand caused by 
its fast economic growth rate and heavy investment in infrastructure. Some 
analysts also expect it to want to build up its stocks of both refined 
copper and concentrates so that it has sufficient stocks to see it through 
any problems following the (long-anticipated) death of Deng Xiaoping. So far 
this buying has not come through, so analysts are beginning to wonder if 
China now reckons that it has sufficient reserves of copper.

 In the first half of June the copper market was riddled with rumours that 
Sumitomo's chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, had either resigned or been 
sacked. Finally. Sumitomo made an announcement on 13 June in which the 
company revealed that Hamanaka had been responsible for US Dollars 1.8bn 
worth of unauthorised trading over the past decade. The big fear in the 
copper market is that Sumitomo, which had a reputation for building up 
stocks which it then used to squeeze traders who were short of copper might 
now be holding more of the metal than it needs. This could mean that it 
would become a seller of copper, driving prices down further. 

 This fear drove the copper price down to US Dollars 1,850 a tonne on the 
day that Hamanaka's unauthorised trading was revealed. Although the price 
recovered to close at just over US Dollars 2,000 a tonne, we would expect 
the price to remain weak.

 So. What is clear from the tables and charts on this page is that weaker 
copper prices pose a big threat to both Chile's and Peru's prospects for a 
trade surplus this year. If copper prices were to average US Dollars 0.90 
for the year, Chile's copper revenues would fall by a quarter, even assuming 
a 10% rise in export volumes. The same would happen in Peru's case, though 
the consequences could be more dramatic since the trade account is already a 
problem. 

 In 1995, copper provided 21% of Peru's export revenues, and 41% of Chile's. 

 So far comment from both Chile and Peru on the prospects for the copper 
market have been muted; Juan Villarzu, president of the state-owned 
Corporacion del Cobre, the world's biggest copper producer, has said that 
the London Metal Exchange, the world's main copper market, must do more to 
ensure a more stable market.

 Eduardo Aninat, the Chilean finance minister, has said that the budget 
could be affected by the fall in copper prices. Last year Codelco alone 
provided the government with US Dollars 1.3bn: this was more than the rest 
of the corporate sector put together provided. Chile's total tax revenues in 
1995 were US Dollars 10bn.

 PERU: LOOKING FOR A BOOM: AS NEW INVESTMENT FLOODS IN

 The Peruvian mining industry expects to be exporting US Dollars 4bn worth 
of metals by 2005. In 1995, the industry exported metals worth US Dollars 
2.6bn.

 The president of the Sociedad Nacional de Mineria y Petroleo, Walter 
Sologuren, said that the growth of the industry would be led by new 
discoveries, privatisation and the renewed interest multinational mining 
companies were now showing in the industry. He said that this made a change: 
he claimed that the country had been spurned by investors since 1970.

 Sologuren said that he expected total investment in the mining industry to 
be US Dollars 13bn between 1995 and 2005. Of that, he expected foreign 
mining companies to stump up 60%.   

 Sologuren said that the country would be producing around 2m t of refined 
metals by the year 2004. He claimed that the biggest increase would probably 
come in gold production. He expected that Peru would be the biggest gold 
producer in Latin America by the end of the century, producing around 100t. 
In 1995 the country produced 56t which produced export revenues of US 
Dollars 460m. 

 Copper. Copper production has increased, especially at Toquepala, Cuajone, 
Cerro Verde and Tintaya. The big boost has come at Cerro Verde and Tintaya, 
which were privatised. In 1995, copper exports were US Dollars 1.2bn, up 
from US Dollars 824m in 1994. 

 The total revenues from mining exports were US Dollars 2.60bn in 1995, up 
from US Dollars 1.96bn in 1994.

 Gold. The fastest growing export, though, was gold. Export revenues 
increased by 37% as export volumes rose by 35%. Peruvian goldminers talk 
optimistically about the world developing a shortage of gold. Jaime Uranga, 
president of the Comite Aurifero de la Sociedad Nacional de Mineria y 
Petroleo, said that the world's current gold production of about 2,268t a 
year was about 1,000t short of demand, which he estimated to be 3,550t. So 
far, he said, the shortfall had been covered by loans or sales from stocks 
held either by central banks or investors.

 The whole question of gold supply and demand is complicated by the fact 
that one source of demand is from mining companies which borrow gold to 
develop new gold mines. They pay back the loans with their new production. 
Frequently the goldmines also hedge their production forward to lock in 
prices when they believe that prices might fall. 

 The core of the demand argument which suggests that prices are unlikely to 
fall is that production from the world's largest gold producer, South 
Africa, is falling at an annual rate of between 15% and 20%. South Africa's 
deep mines are some of the most expensive to operate in the world.

 Peru's main goldmine is Yanacocha which is owned by the big US mining 
company, Newmont. Yanacocha recently discovered another gold deposit, Sipan, 
which holds 16.8m t of ore with an average gold content of 1.73g per t and 
an average silver content of 4.1g per tonne. This mine is likely to come on 
stream in 1998. 

 Yanacocha is scheduled to produce 620,000 ounces (19.2t) this year, up from 
552,000 ounces in 1995. 

 Silver: Peru's export revenues rose by 13% even though the international 
price of silver fell by 13%. 

 New law: The government has promulgated a new law which tidies up some of 
the outstanding questions of ownership rights. The new law, which has been 
approved by congress, cleans up the register of claims, throwing out 11,000 
claims and forcing another 9,000 to lapse. The new law also stipulates that 
the coordinates of new (and all existing) concessions must be surveyed and 
marked on a single geographical map.

 SURINAME: BAUXITE: DEMAND: BY UNION

 The Paranam Workers' Union has pulled back from a confrontation with the 
management at Suralco. The union had issued an ultimatum, which expired on 9 
June, demanding a salary increase of 185%.

 The management had offered 30%, saying it could not afford higher 
increases. 

 The union points out that the official figure for inflation was 238% in 
1995, so even a 185% rise would represent a fall in real wages. 

 Despite the rejection of its ultimatum the union has resumed talks with the 
management. The union says that it will not do anything to damage the 
company, though it points out that the company's income is US Dollars 140 
per day per worker, yet the average daily wage is only US Dollars 4. 

 Gold: Uruguay's first gold mine is scheduled to come into production in 
1998. Owned and operated by the American Resource Corporation, the Mina San 
Gregorio will cost about US Dollars 50m to develop. It reckons to produce 
75,000 ounces (2.3t) of gold a year from processing 1m t of ore. The mine is 
based in the north of the country at Minas de Corrales, close to the border 
with Brazil. American Resource made its first venture into Uruguay in 1993 
when it extracted US Dollars 8m worth of gold from a mine that was thought 
to be exhausted at San Jose, 90km from Montevideo.

 Copper: Chile's Codelco and the Australian Mutual Provident Society have 
revealed more about their joint venture, Los Andes. In the initial stages 
the company will concentrate on developing Maria Delia, Sierra Jardin, 
Exploradora and Sierra de Moreno. These are all copper mines. Codelco will 
provide US Dollars 12m while AMP will supply US Dollars 6m. Los Andes' 
president will be Edgardo Boeninger, a former minister and senior official 
at the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.

 CUBA: FOCUS ON CUBA'S BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY: TRYING TO BOOST EXPORTS

 Cuba has been trying to build up its biotechnology industry for at least 
the past two decades. It has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in 
government-run research institutes such as the Centro de Ingenieria Genetica 
y Biotecnologia, the most famous of the 30 or so biotech institutes in Cuba. 

 The government has long nursed ambitions of becoming a major exporter of 
biotechnology. Indeed, before the collapse of Comecon in 1989, Cuba claimed 
to be exporting US Dollars 500m worth of medicines a year. This figure has 
since dwindled, along with exports of other Cuban products, to US Dollars 
100m.

 Cuba's most successful products are anti-meningitis and hepatitis vaccines 
and some diagnostic kits. Last year the country recently used its own anti-
leprosy vaccine to fight an outbreak of that disease in Holguin, it 
inoculated 120,000 people against the disease. The country also has high 
hopes of a product that deals with Tresteza, a disease that can wipe out 
citrus crops.

 Generally, however, the performance of Cuban products in export markets has 
been disappointing.

 Cuba claims to have 5,000 scientists and technicians working in its 
mediacal research industry. The quality of the scientists must be open to 
question: Jamaica recently ended its agreement to recognise Cuban medical 
qualifications after some poor experiences with Cuban trained doctors. 

 The most success the Cubans had was in selling biotech goods to other Latin 
American countries. Brazil and Colombia especially had been (reasonably) 
enthusiastic buyers of Cuban made medicines. Last year Colombia signed a US 
Dollars 10m deal to buy Cuban-made hepatitis and antimeningococcal 
meningitis Group B vaccine. Other Latin American countries have also bought 
a cholesterol-reducing drug PPG. 

 Cuba had also managed to sell interferons (which are used for a variety of 
tasks from diagnosing pregnancy to dealing with AIDS infections) to China.  

 York deal. The government has now changed tack and started to use 
established companies to break into new markets. It recently signed a deal 
with a Canadian firm, York Medical, to develop and sell Cuban biotech 
products in Canada and Europe. 

 The government awarded York a licence to test and market human and 
veterinary pharmaceuticals made by the biotech industry. Under this deal, 
York Medical will transfer technology and test products in Canadian biotech 
facilities. Cubans will also be trained to develop and market products. 

 York says that it will not only market Cuban biotech products in developed 
markets, such as Canada and Europe, but it will also assist in financing new 
products and getting them through the regulatory and quality controls which 
keep them from new markets. 

 Immediate plans. For the moment, York will concentrate on marketing 15 
Cuban biotech products (such as Heberquinasa (which eliminates blood clots); 
an epidermal growth factor which detects tumours; the antibiotics testing 
system; Diramic; Udertan (a product generated from red mangroves to 
disinfect cow udders); and Dermofural (an antibacterial and anti-fungal 
cream made from sugar cane extract.

 Neither York nor the Cubans expect any trouble from the Helms-Burton Act. 
They say that no US assets are used by the biotech industry and the 
intellectual property on which the industry is based dates from the early 
1980s, well after the 1959 revolution. 

 Non-human strengths. The strongest parts of the Cuban biotech industry 
appear to be in products that do not have medical applications. At a 
conference last year attended by 250 US, European and Latin American 
scientists, there was considerable interest in a vaccine that protects 
cattle against ticks, genetically engineered crops that repel insects and 
industrial enzymes. One of these enzymes dissolves dextran, a gummy 
substance that bogs down the sugar refining process. Cuban sugar producers 
say that the use of the enzyme has cut the sugar mills' energy consumption 
by nearly half.

 Maquila. One idea that has been canvassed by international drug producers 
is to use Cuba as a cheap manufacturing base. This will only happen if the 
country improves its regulatory and control standards: drug companies have 
been scared by what happened to Fisons, a British drug company which is now 
part of the Rorer Group which failed to meet US Food and Drug Administration 
standards at an inspection. The company was forced to stop production until 
it improved its systems. 

 Cuban scientists would certainly like access to hard currencies: at present 
most of them earn less than taxi drivers and barmen. The CIGB is trying to 
improve the scientists' lot by paying some of their salaries in dollars.
