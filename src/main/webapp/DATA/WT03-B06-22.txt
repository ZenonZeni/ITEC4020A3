STATISTICS

November's inflation rate dropped to 4.5%, after rising to 4.7% in October.
Preliminary data show that December's rate may be as low as
3%.

The ruble lost 1.4% of its value against the dollar.  It opened at 4,580 to
$1 on 12/1 and closed at 4,645 on 12/29.  It is likely that the ruble will
decline sharply in early January as new ruble corridor trading limits go
into effect.

The RINACO Plus RESI index of Russian stocks fell during the month by
several percent.  (Technical difficulties prevent inclusion of
full data for the month.)

1995 AT FIRST GLANCE

Although the results of the Duma elections on December 17 showed widespread
dissatisfaction with the government's economic policies, (see "Duma Election
Results,") there can be little doubt that they produced substantive changes
in economic performance in 1995.

Preliminary data indicates that in many respects the economy improved
markedly over 1994;  in other respects, the rate of overall decline has
slowed considerably.

In the opinion of many economists, the country stands on edge of an up-turn
in 1996: 
                            1994      1995
GDP (%change)                -15%     -4%
Industrial output            -21%     -3%
Inflation                    226%     140%
Deficit (%of GDP)            10%      4%
Unemployment                 6%       8%

STRIKES WIDEN

Strikes began to hit widespread sectors of the economy, prompted primarily
by the enormous backlog of unpaid wages and rising unemployment.

The Federation of Independent Trade Unions (FNPR) called for a nationwide
"Day of Action" on November 30, which brought out thousands of workers.
Demonstrations were held in some cities, but not Moscow, St. Petersburg or
Novgorod.

The FNPR has claimed that workers are owed a total of 13.6 trillion rubles
(about $2.9 bln).  In addition, although by ILO criteria the country's
unemployment rate is 8%, organized labor has charged that the actual rate,
including "hidden unemployment," is 15%.

Trains between St. Petersburg and Moscow, one of the primary freight and
passenger rail corridors in the country, were halted on December 7 when the
Oktyabrskaya Railway said it had no money to pay two months' salaries.

Coal miners, who continue to hold labor actions, have demanded another Rb
500 bln in arrears.  Although the government had just allocated Rb 500 bln
for this purpose, union leaders said the amount was insufficient and wanted
it doubled, to a total of Rb 1 trillion.

Oil workers in Komi and miners in Tula were staging hunger strikes to
protest working conditions as well as unpaid wages.   

As the month progressed, school teachers nationwide went out on strike as
well as air traffic controllers in some areas.  

On many occasions in 1995, President Yeltsin and other government spokesmen
issued calls for wage arrears to be paid, particularly during the run-up to
the Duma elections.  Almost all the back salaries are owed by state
enterprises and agencies.

CBR TO HELP BANKS

The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) may be abandoning credit auctions as a
means of pumping cash into the country's commercial banking system.

A draft document indicates that the CBR is considering allowing banks to use
treasury bills as collateral for repurchase funds.  This is a method widely
used in the West.

The CBR said it would also make special credits available for banks which
are experiencing short-term financial problems.

The number of private banks has declined in the last year, due mainly to
mergers and bankruptcies, and the country's commercial banking system
remains fragile.  With the decline of inflation and the implementation of
the ruble trading corridor, banks have lost the opportunity to earn the
large profits they did in 1992-1994.

PRODUCTION SHARING LAW PASSED

After months of often acrimonious debate, the Federation Council, the upper
house of the parliament, has finally passed a law regulating oil production
sharing agreements with foreign firms.

The law, which was passed by the Duma some time ago, was rejected by the
Council last month, and was heavily amended before final passage.

The revised law requires the Duma to approve each production sharing
agreement reached between foreign and domestic oil companies, limits the
legal recourse of foreign investors to international courts, and gives
Russia a unilateral right of renegotiation should world oil prices change.

A number of pending major deals are awaiting passage of the law, including
Exxon's $10 bln Sakhalin-1 project. Reportedly, tens of billions of dollars
in other investments are also on hold.

Opponents of the Council's version, which was influenced by nationalist
demands, believe that it creates an unfavorable climate for
desperately-needed foreign investments.  There was some speculation that
President Yeltsin would veto it.

Western oil firms declined public comment on the new law, although their
reaction has been reported as being negative.

RUBLE CORRIDOR COULD END

Sergei Alekhashenko, the new first deputy chairman of the CBR, said that the
ruble corridor could end in mid-1996.  Alekhashenko said he was speaking on
his own, and not expressing bank policy.  

Prior to his appointment, he was the head of a think tank associated with
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.

Alekhashenko's views have been supported by President Yeltsin's top economic
advisor, Aleksandr Livshits.

ECONOMIC NOTES

Agriculture Minister Aleksandr Nazarchuk, said that reforms are necessary to
rescue large, inefficient former collective and state farms. He said that as
many as 40% of these farms are "incapable of working efficiently" and that
urgent action, including land privatization, is required to ease the situation.
+++
At present, 136 foreign banks are operating in Russia.  Of these, 10 are
fully-owned by foreign banks, and 50 have mixed capital.

Russian banks have not been as successful in opening offices in the US.
Promstroibank,Incombank and Credit-Moscow have thus far been unable to
obtain permission from the Treasury Department to open offices in New York.
The only Russian bank with US representation is Vnesheconombank.
+++
A study conducted by the Leontiev Center and the Russian Marketing
Association has shown that the country's private sector is performing
much better than the state sector.

Private enterprises recorded production increases of 2.3% in 1995, compared
to a drop of 10% in the state sector.  In addition, after
being adjusted for inflation, salaries in the private sector rose by an
average of 9.8%, while state salaries fell 6.6%.
+++
In the first 11 months of 1995, Russia's foreign trade increased 21%, to
$113 bln, over the same period in 1994.  The trade surplus was $31 bln.

Exports to non-CIS countries rose 28% while those to the CIS fell by 4%.
+++
A survey compiled by the Corporate Resources Group in Switzerland shows that
Moscow is the world's most expensive city outside Japan.  On a scale in
which New York City is 100 points, Moscow ranked 142, just ahead of Zurich
and Geneva.
+++
Russia will impose quotas on the import of textiles from the European
Community to protect its domestic textile industry.

Data released show that textile imports to Russia exceeded exports by $563 mln.
+++
The Ministry of Economics said that it expected investments to grow by 4% in
1996 and rise to Rb 310 trillion ($67 bln).  It expects Rb 50
trillion of this total to come from Russian banks, a figure the Association
of Russian Banks disputes.  The group noted that commercial banks were able
to raise less than Rb 5 trillion to participate in the last round of stock
auctions.
+++
The agreement by which DeBeers sells 95% of Russia's diamonds through its
Central Selling Organization has been extended until February 1, giving
negotiators a chance to reach agreement on a new deal.  It had been reported
that the talks were at an impasse, and that no new arrangement would be
possible before the December 31 expiration.
+++
Russia, Azerbaijan and an international oil consortium have signed a
agreement to transport Caspian Sea oil through a Russian pipeline to
the port of Novorossisk.

The pipeline, owned by the state-owned monopoly Transneft, will go into
operation in the second half of 1996.
+++
Russian computer companies may be experiencing difficulties owing to
consolidations in the banking sector.  This may result in sales and
production slowdowns for the first time since 1988.  For some time, the
primary markets for Russian-made computers has been the banking
industry and state organizations.
+++
Reaction to the Duma elections and uncertainty about June's presidential
elections sent the value of Russian stocks down in trading on exchanges
across the country.  By the end of the month, shares were trading 30% below
their 1995 highs.

Russian and foreign brokers said that they believed buying opportunities
existed, and that stocks could be bought at bargain prices.

STET DEAL OFF

Russia's single largest privatization deal collapsed when Italy's STET
declined to make an initial payment for the 25% stake in Svyazinvest it had
successfully won at auction.

The auction, held on December 1, was expected to raise $430 mln in cash plus
a commitment for an investment of $400 per share over the next 2 years.
STET's winning bid was $630 mln plus the investment promise.

After some initial confusion, during which the State Property Committee
claimed the deal was off and STET insisted it was on, it was
announced on the 26th that the offer was dead.

The committee issued a statement saying, "In spite of the Russian
government's desire to compromise, STET insisted on a form of payment
which went totally beyond the tender conditions."

There were suggestions, which were discounted by outside observers and the
Russian government, that STET pulled out because of the results of the Duma
elections.  Sources close to STET's board of directors said that the company
had reconsidered its bid because it would be unable to realize a return on
its investment until the year 2000.  

A more likely cause of the collapse was STET's reluctance to make its
initial payment until all the details of the transaction had been clarified
by the Property Committee and until the future of Svyazinvest's
relationships with the 85 regional telephone companies it controls were
completely spelled out.

The government announced that it would reschedule the auction of the 25%
stake in Svyazinvest, perhaps as early as January, and would continue plans
to sell a further 24% share in the telephone company.  At present, it is
impossible to say whether the deal's collapse will affect the overall
privatization effort.

DEBT/EQUITY SWAP PROPOSED

The head of the State Property Committee, Alfred Kokh, said that the agency
was beginning work on a plan which would allow creditors to swap their
Russian debt for shares in Russian companies.

Kokh indicated that state-owned shares would continue to be sold in 1996,
including stakes in a dozen major companies, including the insurance giant,
Rosgosstrakh.

At a minimum, market capitalization would have to be raised 10 times in
1996, to at least $60 bln for Kokh's proposal to work.  Kokh said that his
agency's preliminary goal was to raise market capitalization, currently
about $7 bln, some 15 to 20 times, in 1996, allowing the debt/equity swap to
begin in late 1996 or early 1997.

Russian stock prices, due to political uncertainties and charges that the
privatization process has allowed well-placed companies to buy shares at
rock-bottom prices, are currently depressed, and it remains to be seen
whether the government's ambitious privatization goals for 1996 can be
achieved.  

It was hoped to raise $1.9 bln in 1995, but with the collapse of the STET
offer, this goal will probably not be met.

BANK PRIVATIZATION DELAYED

The State Duma passed a law on December 10 postponing the privatization of
former Soviet foreign and other banks.  Under the terms of existing
legislation, these banks were to have been privatized by January 1, 1996,
but the Duma has pushed the target date back to January 1, 2000.

Among the banks affected are the nationwide savings bank, Sberbank, and
Vnesheconombank, formerly Vneshtorgbank.

OIL STAKES SOLD

Stakes in major oil producing companies were sold in December, mostly to
groups of banks.

Stolichny Bank Sberizhni and the unknown Neftyanaya Finansovaya Kompaniya
successfully acquired 51% of Sibneft for $100.3 mln.  The banks' bid was
guaranteed by Bank Menatep, which is a major participant in the acquisition
of 78% of the YUKOS oil group.

NIKoil, a financial consulting firm, bought 16% of the oil giant,  LUKoil.
NIKoil was already acting as a broker for LUKoil, adding to charges that the
auctions were controlled by a small group of insiders.

RYBINSK MOTORS SALE DELAYED

An auction for 37% of the aircraft engine manufacturer Rybinsk Motors was
put back until February because of court challenges to the sale.

Company executives have brought suit disputing the authority of the State
Property Committee to hold the sale, to the declaration of the company's
bankruptcy, and to the inclusion in the company's assets of a fund designed
to benefit the workforce.

The auction may be held as early as February.  Gazprom, the producer of
natural gas, has indicated that it will try to acquire the engine manufacturer.

CURRENCY CONTROLS 


A decree establishing currency controls on the import-export trade is being
considered,according to a report in Nezvisimaya Gazeta.

The decree will require that payments to resident importers be made through
their Russian accounts and that importers will have to produce goods and
records to show that the value of payments and goods imported is equivalent.

This is being done as much to curb tax evasion as it is to reduce hard
currency flight.

EXPORT DUTIES CUT

President Yeltsin signed a decree banning export duties on refined oil
products and lumber products as of December 1, 1995.  

Effective January 1, 1996, export duties on crude oil, natural gas and
industrial goods will be reduced by 50%.

Oil exports, one of the country's major sources of export earnings, fell by
5% in the first 10 months of 1995 largely because of high duties.

Commission, which will have the authority to regulate pricing of the
country's "natural monopolies."

The new body will set prices for oil products,natural gas, pipelines, heat
and electricity. As of January 1, energy producers will be able
to raise prices only in line with actual inflation and with the permission
of the Energy Commission.

REGIONAL LAWS

Regional (oblast) authorities in many parts of the country have passed laws
and regulations designed to fill holes in national laws.

At a meeting of regional officials in Volgograd, various measures were
discussed. The Volgograd Oblast Duma Budget Committee head, Aleksandr
Morozov, said that his body had passed laws concerning non-state pension
funds, the activities of credit unions, and the issuance of promissory notes.

Regional officials complained that federal courts and procurators' offices
were unclear on what to do about such legislation and have not
adapted to it.

REPORTING LAW

Under current law, companies are required to pay their employees' salaries
through a single account, registered with local tax boards and
the state pension fund.

Since a large number of companies have been avoiding pension fund and other
non-budgetary fund payments, the CBR has recommended new
regulations.

The proposed law will require banks to report all new accounts opened by
companies to the CBR within 5 days. Included are budget, credit, loan and
hard currency accounts.

Instructions No. 30 of the CBR and No. 01-20/10538 of the Customs Committee
introduce Import Passports, which are similar to the
Export Passports already in use.

Import Passports will be required for all imports to be customs cleared as
of January 1,1996 in which payment was, or is to be, made in full or in part
in any currency other than rubles.  Goods which are imported free of charge
or from other CIS countries are exempt.

GRAIN IMPORTS BEGIN

It has been speculated for months that Russia's poor grain harvests in 1995
would force it to begin importing large quantities of Western
grain, , as much as 6 mln metric tons. Grain prices, which are near 15-year
record high levels, gained on European and American exchanges amid reports
that Russia had obtained $800 mln in credits to buy 2.5 mln tonnes of wheat.
The reports were later found to be untrue.

The Agriculture Ministry reported that a private company, Roskhleboprodukt,
had purchased $300 mln of wheat from Austria,
Hungary and the US.  The company is said to be linked with one of the
country's major banks, Oneksimbank.

Two other leading banks, Menatep and Inkombank,said that they were "talking
about buying a large amount" of grain, but that no specifice
deals had yet been reached.

The Economy Ministry reported that regions in the Far East had made
arrangements to import 400,000 tonnes of grain through commercial
companies.  These deals, according to the Ministry, were made at the
regional level and did not involve the central government.

While current stocks and reserves will be exhausted by June, estimates are
that the 1996 harvest will recover, and could be as high as 80 mln tonnes.
In the meantime, grain prices on Russian exchanges has remained relatively
stable, at about Rb 850,000/tonne.

REFINERIES TO BE REVAMPED

The Fuel and Energy Ministry will implement a program to modernize its
refineries, but said that unprofitable units will not be improved and may
even be allowed to close.

The Ministry said that the program had been developed in conjunction with
the Ministries of Economy and Finance, the State Property Committee and the
Federal Bankruptcy Agency.

Russia's refineries are in poor physical condition and require massive
infusions of technology and money.  Production fell 17% last year, and has
dropped 38% since 1990.  The average refinery is operating at 65% of capacity.

The Ministry did not say how much money would be made available, but did
indicate that it would come from private and state sources.  It also said
that tax breaks and other "privileges" for refineries would be adopted as
part of the plan.

Refineries who wished to participate in the program are expected to produce
business and technical plans for review.

TIMBER EXPORTS SLUMP

Declining world prices for timber, pulp and paper and the ruble trading
corridor have resulting in a substantial decrease in Russian timber exports.  

It has been reported that in some regions, export enterprises are sitting on
millions of dollars worth of product for which buyers can not be found.
Although the government has tried to help the situation by reducing export
duties on wood and wood products, industry spokesmen have said that
successful timber trade needs an exchange rate of Rb 7,000 to $1, well above
the level of Rb 4,500 - 5,000 which has been maintained since June.

THE DUMA ELECTIONS by Josh Zander

Depending the source, the results of last month's Duma elections presumably
show that either nothing or everything has changed with regard to the reform
process in Russia.

Western news media and, to some degree, the business community, have given
the impression that the strong showing of the Communists means that the
reform process has come to a halt.  Other observers, reinforced by the
government, believe that nothing has really changed and that the process
will continue at an accelerated pace.

Who is correct?

THE VOTE
In summary, the Communists were the strong showers, gaining 112 seats in the
new Duma.  However, the extreme left bloc of parties, including the
Communists, Agrarians, Women of Russia and Working Russia, gained only 58
seats, rising from 100 to 178.  Both Women of Russia and the Agrarians lost
heavily.

The far right parties, primarily the Liberal Democrats and  the  Congress of
Russian Communities (KRO), had a net loss of 7 seats.   KRO, under the
leadership of General Lebed, had been expected to do much better in the
polls, and he is expected to run in the presidential campaign in June.

Most disappointing were the results for the democratic, pro-reform parties:
Our Home is Russia, Yabloko and Democratic Choice.  As a whole, they were
able to gain only 8 seats.  Democratic Choice, which had 76 seats in the old
Duma, will have 9 in the new one.

The election results can hardly be said to contain a ringing endorsement of
the government's policies but neither can they be interpreted as being a
wholesale rejection of those policies.

Undoubtedly, there will be much speculation about the political impact of
the results in the months to come, culminating with June's presidential
elections.  Rather than trying to gauge the political impact, what can the
Duma elections tell us about Russia's business climate in at least the first
half of 1996?

POSITIVES...
The single most important factor is that neither of the two blocs most
opposed to the reform process, the Communists and the extreme nationalists,
have a majority in the new Duma.  

Even allied, which they have not thus far been able to do, the two groups
are far short of the 2/3 majority required to overturn presidential vetoes.

A simple majority of the Duma can pass a no-confidence measure or block
appointments by the prime minister.  It is not likely that the extremists
can muster sufficient votes to do the former.  The Duma's refusal to confirm
the head of the Central Bank for 13 months did nothing to hinder the
adoption of effective tight money policies.

The constitutionally weak Duma can be a thorn in the side of the current
government, but it does not appear that it do it any serious harm.

It must be remembered that 1996 has begun with a budget already in place, a
stabilized ruble, and inflation at the lowest levels since 1991. The country
appears to be poised at the beginning of a period of economic growth.

AND NEGATIVES
The fact that the center bloc of parties did not do better at the polls is
the single most negative factor of the elections.  

The vote clearly shows that a substantial portion, perhaps a majority, of
the electorate do not believe they have materially benefitted from the
reform process.  While the totals may be skewed by the elements of the
population who actually voted and may reflect a nostalgia for the "good old
days," the reform process has been dealt a psychological, if not a material,
blow.

Stock market averages are at depressed levels, down some 30% from their 1995
highs.  Investor confidence, shaken by the vote, is further upset by the
failure of the STET-Svyazinvest deal.  Many potential investors are taking a
wait-and-see attitude, pending the outcome of the June elections.

This will make it more difficult to raise sufficient capital to accomplish
the government's privatization goals.  These goals are not only critical for
the budget, but are the primary means of  modernizing Russia's economy. 

Added to this will be pressures brought by Communists and nationalists to
delay or suspend the privatization of "strategic" industries and that high
prices, perhaps unreasonably, are gotten for what enterprises are sold off.

There will be a greater effort to prevent the kind of "sweetheart" deals
which have characterized many of the major privatizations last year, and
there will be more resistance to privatizing, especially with Western
investment, the military-industrial complex.

At the same time, the Communists will probably make an effort to expand the
social safety net.  Friction between the Duma and the government may impede
enaction of  necessary legislation.  It is safe to say that this friction
will preclude any major legislative actions until after June's elections, at
the earliest.

THE NEXT 6 MONTHS...
To some extent, business in Russia will slow until June, especially as far
as major private investments are concerned.  In light of the STET deal's
collapse, there will be much more hesitancy to invest in Russia.

Russian stocks will probably remain at low levels, if only for psychological
reasons.  While they afford some investors long term gains, it will make it
more difficult for companies to raise capital.

Both President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin have stated that the
government's course will not change despite the election results, but the
results themselves will compel the government to, if not slow the pace of
reform, moderate its worst effects.

Increasing pensions and minimum wages, reimbursing investors of failed
enterprises, and similar measures may be popular and may win votes in June,
but could return the country to high inflation rates and destabilization of
the ruble.

Some of the pressures from within the Duma may result in actions positive
from a business point of view.  General Lebed, the KRO leader, has struck a
very popular chord with his attacks on bureaucratic and official corruption. 

The government has not been deaf to this message.   Any substantive
reduction in Russia's endemic problem of corruption can only benefit
business at every level.

Continued reductions in export duties will benefit exporters and the
increasing number of Russian producers engaging in export trade.  The
government will also be compelled to address the issue of unpaid wages.
This is one of the primary causes of mass discontent. Although payment may
bring inflationary pressure and worsen the deficit, the economy, at least
for the short term, will benefit from the payment of workers in rubles
instead of cigarettes, coal, paper or even tampons.

It is likely that the government will release billions of dollars in
payments for various programs in the defense, lawenforcement, agriculture
and social sectors.  It did this in the weeks before the Duma elections.
While this will exacerbate the deficit, it may help stimulate the economy in
the short term, and some industries will benefit.

It is widely expected  that economic growth will begin in the second half of
1996;  statistics indicate that it has already begun in some industries.

The government will do all it can to accelerate this process, so that more
people perceive a tangible benefit prior to the presidential elections.

AND BEYOND 
Do the Duma elections mean that Russia's economic reform process is in
serious trouble or even dead?  At this point, the answer is no.

It is not in the interest of any of the major parties, with the possible
exception of the Liberal Democrats, to drastically slow, let alone, reverse
the general course on which the country has been since 1992.

In the wake of the elections, it will probably be a tendency of the business
community, both Russian and foreign, to do nothing new;  to wait until after
the presidential elections in June.  

The next six months will be a critical period in the course of Russia's
development.  If the economy can be seen to have turned the corner, if
average citizen can see if he or she is beginning to materially benefit from
the reform process, it will continue at an accelerated pace.
