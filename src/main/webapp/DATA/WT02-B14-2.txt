<a name="RTFToC2">Salvadorans
TPS to Expire</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 2, it was announced that Temporary Protected Status or TPS for El
Salvadorans will be allowed to lapse on December 31, 1994.  Over 500,000
Salvadorans are believed to have come to the US during the 1980s, most
illegally, when civil war killed about 70,000 people and death squads spread
terror.  Most Salvadoran applications for political asylum in the US during the
1980s were denied.<p>
<p>
The 1990 IMMACT granted Salvadorans TPS in the US, which was extended by
President Bush in 1992 and Clinton in 1993.  The civil war in El Salvador ended
in 1992, and INS Commissioner Meissner said that today the "situation in El
Salvador has improved significantly and no longer serves as a basis for
continuing 'temporary' asylum."<p>
<p>
An estimated one million Salvadorans live in the United States in 1994--half in
Los Angeles--meaning that one in six Salvadorans lives in the US.  About half
are legal immigrants.  Between 90,000 and 190,000 Salvadorans are protected by
the TPS which is expiring--the INS does not have more precise data.  <p>
<p>
Salvadorans who currently have work authorization will be granted automatic
nine-month extensions, according to a notice published in the Federal Register
on December 6, 1994.  Salvadorans who apply for asylum in the US before
September 1995 will be able to stay longer.  <p>
<p>
Salvadorans' asylum claims today are eligible for special due process
consideration under a 1990 court case that alleged that during the 1980s the US
discriminated against asylum -seekers from El Salvador and Guatemala.  Less
than five percent of the applications for asylum filed by Salvadorans have been
granted.  Some social service agencies are urging Salvadorans to request asylum
in order to prolong their US stays and possibly gain permanent residence status
at a future date.  Under US law, aliens who have been in the US for at least
seven years, have good moral character, and would face hardship if returned,
can remain in the US indefinitely.<p>
<p>
In a profile of Salvadorans in Long Island, New York, it was noted that
Salvadorans are already discussing ways to stay permanently in the US,
including marrying a US citizen or legal immigrant at the going rate of $3,000.
<p>
<p>
Many Salvadorans were attracted to the US  by jobs that paid $5 hourly, but
they expected to live at Salvadoran costs in the US.  With mainstream US prices
too high, they have spawned an underground economy in which medical and similar
services are offered by unlicensed providers at less than half the going rates.
Such "immigrant economies" are responsible for reviving turn-of-the-century
institutions, such as live poultry markets in New York City.<p>
<p>
Salvadorans in the US remit an estimated $600 million to $1 billion to their
country annually, much of it to regions devastated by the civil war.  The 5.4
million Salvadorans in 1992 had an average annual GNP of $1,200 per capita.
Salvadoran exports in 1992 were worth $400 million, and imports were worth $1.1
billion; the gap was financed by remittances.<p>
<p>
Commentators were divided on the whether the end of TPS was desirable.  Those
who favored ending TPS argued that, if TPS were extended once again, the entire
concept would be in danger, since opponents could argue that TPS was simply a
side door to permanent immigration.  Opponents argued that the Salvadorans were
truly refugees, and that US support for the Salvadoran government prevented the
US from recognizing the Salvadorans in the US as legitimate refugees who should
have been allowed to start their lives anew in the US.  Many advocates for
Salvadorans argued that there would be mass firings of persons whose work
permits would expire September 30, 1995.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">US
Changes Asylum Regulations</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In an effort to re-establish the proper balance "between compassion and
control," INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on December 2 announced that asylum
applicants will have to wait for a ruling on their applications, or for six
months, before receiving work permits.   Under current rules, asylum applicants
can receive work permits within 90 days of applying for asylum, allegedly
encouraging aliens to file false asylum claims in order obtain permission to
work in the US.<p>
<p>
There are 425,000 pending asylum applications, and about 13,000 more are filed
each month.  INS announced plans to add staff and streamline the processing of
asylum applications.  The number of asylum officers will be doubled to 334, and
the number of immigration judges will rise by 63 to 179.  <p>
<p>
With these additional staff, the INS hopes to interview each applicant and make
an initial decision on all applications within 60 days by April, 1995.  Final
decisions are expected within six months.  The INS decided not to charge
applicants for asylum a proposed $130 filing fee.<p>
<p>
In recent years, about 120,000 persons have applied each year for asylum,
generating 120,000 first-level decisions on whether an individual (and
dependents) should be granted refugee status in the US.  About 10 percent of
these decisions are appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and 10
percent of them, or 1,200, are appealed to the Federal Courts of Appeal.  This
puts a heavy workload on a system not designed for so many cases--almost
one-fourth of the judges in the 9th Circuit, which includes California, spend
all their time on asylum cases.<p>
<p>
This means that the INS must "remove" from the US about 90,000 rejected asylum
seekers each year.  By all accounts, the removal system is not working well,
and the Commission on Immigration reform held a hearing on December 14 to
discuss methods to make the removal system work better.<p>
<p>
The INS has a three-section enforcement effort-- the so-called front, middle,
and back ends of the illegal immigration issue.  The front end refers to
efforts to keep illegal aliens and asylum seekers out of the US with border
controls and safe havens, the middle refers to employer sanctions and
eligibility tests for social benefits, and the back end refers to efforts to
removal of illegal aliens from the US.<p>
<p>
There are estimated to be four million illegal aliens in the US.  Every year,
about 1.3 million are located just inside the US-Mexican border, and almost all
of them agree to "voluntarily" return to their country of origin, Mexico.  In
addition, about 40,000 aliens are deported to a range of countries.<p>
<p>
The INS targets its limited resources on removing criminal illegal aliens after
they have served sentences in the US for crimes committed here.  Under US law,
illegal aliens are provided with lawyers at public expense to defend themselves
in criminal trials, but they are not provided with lawyers when, at the end of
their sentence, they are asked to show why they should not be deported to their
country of origin.  <p>
<p>
The 20,000 non-US citizens in federal prison are about one-fourth of all
federal prisoners, and the 30,000 non-US citizens in state prison are about
five percent of all state prisoners.  Half of the federal non-US citizens are
from Mexico and Colombia.  Most of the federal and many of the state alien
prisoners were convicted of smuggling drugs into or within the US.  In many
cases, those convicted are relatively low-level players, but they often have a
sufficient quantity of drugs that they commit felonies.  <p>
<p>
If aliens are released from prison, and then told to show up at a hearing so
that it can be determined whether they should remain in the US, virtually none
appear.  For this reason, immigration judges are going into federal and state
prisons to hold deportation hearings there, so that aliens can be deported as
they leave prison.<p>
<p>
Florida and the INS are cooperating on a program under which aliens convicted
of non-violent felonies are offered clemency if they agree to be deported.  If
the alien is later apprehended in the US, he/she must serve the original jail
term, plus up to 20 years for returning to the US after being deported.  In
this manner, more prison beds are made available for violent US citizen
offenders.<p>
<p>
It is widely agreed that the INS must do more than just remove criminal aliens
in order to make its removal policies credible.  The issue in most deportation
hearings is not whether the person should be deported--in most instances the
answer is yes--the issue is whether the alien who should be deported is
eligible for some form of relief from deportation, such as being in the US for
seven years, or developing an "equity stake" in the US.  There are private
attorneys in most cities with concentrations of aliens to advise aliens facing
deportation, for a fee, how to avoid deportation.<p>
<p>
Three of the many ideas advanced to speed up and make more credible removals
stand out.  First, add resources to INS and the courts so that hearings can be
conducted quickly, and removals ordered before aliens develop equity stakes.
Second, remove at least some non-criminal aliens to send the message that
removal is a real possibility e.g., remove with publicity some visitors who
overstay their I-94 tourist visas and aliens whose applications for asylum are
rejected.  Third, explore the use of incentives, such as refunding the alien's
share of social security contributions made while employed in the US if the
funds are claimed at the US consulate in the alien's country of origin within
30 days of the order to depart.  For alien's earning $1,000 per month, this
return incentive could amount to almost $1000 per year. <p>
<p>
FBI Director Freeh, in response to the World Trade Center bombing and other
terrorist incidents involving asylum seekers, endorsed proposals to speed up
processes for removing aliens from the US.  Freeh criticized current
regulations, which involve sending aliens letters asking them to "show cause"
why they should not be ordered to leave the US.  Most flee underground rather
than show up for their hearings.  Freeh would increase the bond to guarantee
the alien's appearance.<p>
<p>
According to Freeh, aliens making false asylum claims often enter the US under
the visa waiver program--under which 9.5 million persons arrived in FY 94--and
with student visas and through sham marriages to US citizens.  <p>
<p>
There is reported to be growing illegal immigration by rejected asylum seekers
from the US to Canada, especially along a six-mile stretch of border south of
Vancouver.  Many are reported to be Central Americans who crossed through the
US en route to Canada, where they thought their prospects of receiving asylum
were better.  For the first time in 1993, more asylum applications were filed
in downtown Vancouver than at ports of entry, suggesting that these applicants
entered the country unlawfully.<p>
<p>
Canada has a generous program for asylum applicants.  While waiting one or two
years for a decision, applicants are entitled to a work permit, housing,
welfare, and medical assistance, costing up to $37,000 per alien per year.<p>
<p>
During the summer of 1993, Canada resumed the deportation of criminal aliens to
countries considered dangerous, so that e.g., an Iranian alien convicted of
bringing heroin into Canada was deported even though drug dealers are sometimes
hanged there.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Prop.
187--Enforcement Stayed</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Citing serious constitutional questions, a federal judge in Los Angeles on
December 14 barred the enforcement of Prop. 187's requirement that public
schools and agencies verify the legal status of all persons seeking services
until its constitutionality is determined by the courts.  Judge Pfaelzer
expressed concern that enforcement of Prop. 187 could prompt immigrants
entitled to be in the US to leave the country when, e.g., the police question
those arrested about their immigration status, or when persons entitled to
services under federal law are denied services under Prop. 187 in California.
The judge's preliminary injunction blocks enforcement of all but two of the
initiative's provisions.  <p>
<p>
A state judge has prevented the enforcement of that section of Prop. 187 that
requires verification of legal status in order to obtain lower in-state tuition
at state colleges and universities.  Those portions of Prop. 187 that make it a
state felony to manufacture or distribute false identification papers have gone
into effect.<p>
<p>
In Los Angeles, public service announcements are being played on Spanish
language TV and radio that advise unauthorized immigrants that Prop. 187 is not
being enforced, and recommending that pregnant women and children should
continue to seek needed medical care.  In Sacramento, regulations to implement
187 are being prepared by state agencies, and there is a debate over what
obligation public employees have to report persons "reasonably believed" to be
illegal aliens, and what penalties can be levied on those who fail to report.<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 has slipped from the front pages of California newspapers.  Many of
the Prop. 187 stories in December were profiles of unauthorized immigrants who
were "confused" over which provisions of 187 were being enforced, and often
angry exchanges in letters to newspapers.  A typical profile described how an
eight-month pregnant unauthorized alien did not go to the doctor for fear of
detection and deportation, and her confusion and fears are, according to
immigration advocates, typical.  The number of patients at walk-in clinics
frequented by unauthorized aliens is reportedly down 10 to 20 percent in
southern California.  <p>
<p>
There have been reports that some Californians who supported Prop. 187 have
been asking Latino employees in restaurants and stores for their "green cards."
Prop. 187 does not give customers the right to demand identification from
employees, although one of Prop. 187's backers says that customers may want
assurance that employees are legal in places they frequent.<p>
<p>
Newspapers also report that, despite Prop 187's making the sale or use of false
documents to circumvent immigration laws a state felony, a provision of Prop.
187 that is in effect, fake drivers licenses, social security cards, and
immigrant visas or micas, are still being sold openly in MacArthur and
Huntington Parks in Los Angeles for $50 to $75.  On January 9, 1995, the first
three sellers of false documents are scheduled to be sentenced under Prop. 187
after pleading guilty to selling false documents.  They could receive jail
terms and then be deported.<p>
<p>
In the month since Prop. 187 was enacted, five people have been arrested for
selling false IDs.  Neither city nor county law enforcement agencies have made
arrests for the sale of false immigration documents a priority.  Police report
that false ID sellers are relatively sophisticated--a salesman takes the order,
a runner takes the order to the place where the documents are made, and a third
person delivers the false IDs.  Only at delivery can an arrest be made and,
even though all persons in the distribution chain can be prosecuted under Prop.
187, it has proven difficult to persuade those arrested to reveal their
collaborators.<p>
<p>
California's 8 million Hispanics are being urged to boycott companies such as
Disney that contributed to the re-election campaign of Governor Wilson.
Several groups have asked the nation's 25 million Hispanics to boycott
Disneyland, ridiculed as ''Migra Mouse.''<p>
<p>
Interviews with the drafters of Prop. 187 reveal that the initiative was
drafted by a committee of 10, and that the ban on public education for
unauthorized alien children was included in order to retain the support of the
activists who circulated the petitions to put Prop. 187 on the November 1994
ballot.  According to former INS Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell, Prop. 187
was tested by a couple looking for business for their campaign firm.  <p>
<p>
A California assemblyman, Richard Mountjoy, quickly convinced the "Committee of
10" that the most viable option would be an initiative denying public services
to illegal immigrants.  The fact that different sections have different
definitions of who is eligible for services has played a major role in court
orders to block 187's enforcement.<p>
<p>
The chair of the US Civil Rights Commission, Mary Frances Berry, expressed
concern that Prop. 187 could foster discrimination against Latinos.  At a
Washington, DC informational hearing on December 16, a co-author of 187, Ron
Prince, assured the commission that the initiative did not intend to promote
racial discrimination.  Instead, its aim is to cure "a present system that adds
up to discrimination against US citizens and legal residents of California," by
diverting resources to unauthorized aliens. <p>
<p>
On December 12, about 200 farm workers who typically earn $100 daily cutting
and packing celery for a Dole subsidiary, Bud of California, walked off their
jobs to protest Prop. 187.  The protest was organized by a Spanish-language
radio station in Oxnard to demonstrate the "economic clout" of unauthorized
workers.<p>
<p>
In a case not related to Prop. 187, the California Supreme Court upheld a state
regulation that requires persons seeking state-paid emergency health care to
provide a Social Security Number or admit that they are illegal aliens.  All
persons must be provided with care.<p>
<p>
The Prop 187 movement is spreading to other states.  Floridians for Immigration
Control announced on December 13 that they would mount an effort to enact a
Prop. 187-style state-run verification of eligibility for public benefits law.
Florida has sued the federal government to recoup some costs of providing
services to an estimated 322,000 illegal aliens.  Governor Chiles has announced
that he will oppose the Prop. 187 effort in Florida, saying that it is too
crude an attempt to deal with a complex issue.<b>  </b>Backers need 430,000
signatures by August, 1996 to put the proposal on the November 1996 ballot.<p>
<p>
In Suffolk County, New York, a decade of welcoming Salvadoran refugees ended
with the repeal last year of an ordinance that sheltered Salvadoran refugees.
This summer the county passed the "America First Welfare Reduction Program."
The county's resolution asked the state of New York for permission to deny
health care and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, and to legal immigrants
who are not yet US citizens.  The state refused the request. <p>
<p>
The seven states with the most illegal immigrants--California, New York, Texas,
Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and Arizona<b>--</b> have two-thirds of the
electoral votes needed to elect a US President.  Hispanic activists opposed to
Prop. 187-type measures have announced that they are working hard on the next
great civil rights movement--preserving the rights of legal and unauthorized
aliens.<p>
<p>
Many publications have run editorials decrying or praising Prop. 187.  In a
typical pro-187 editorial, US News and World Report called for giving more
preference in legal immigration to professionals, and requiring adult children
sponsoring their elderly parents to immigrate to the US to be responsible for
their economic well-being for at least 10 years after their arrival.  US News
also called for a reduction in the number of refugees, who are eligible for
welfare upon arrival.<p>
<p>
According to estimates done by The Rand Institute, 85 percent of the children
of illegal aliens in CA aged ten and under were born in the United States, and
are therefore US citizens.  Of those children who are aged 10 to 15, an
estimated 60 per cent were born in the US, and aged 15 to 19, around 50 per
cent.<p>
<p>
The GAO on November 30, 1994 estimated that California spends $2.35 billion per
year providing education, health, and justice services to illegal
aliens--two-thirds of these costs are incurred to provide education, and
one-sixth each to provide health care services and to incarcerate illegal
aliens.<p>
<p>
At a public hearing in mid December in Tijuana, speakers told a newly formed ad
hoc committee that Mexican consulates must become strong advocates for Mexican
citizens abroad.  The committee also discussed increasing its consular corps,
introducing dual US-Mexican citizenship, and developing a trilateral
immigration agreement tied to NAFTA.  The ad hoc committee, chaired by Carlos
Reta Martinez, has 20 members drawn from the PRI and three opposition parties.
The public hearing was the first of several to be held along the border and in
other parts of Mexico that send migrants to the US. <p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Illegal
Immigrants and Devaluation in Mexico</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In the aftermath of Mexican criticism of Operation Gatekeeper and Prop. 187,
there have been several reports of harsh Mexican policies toward illegal
immigrants in Mexico.  Although there are no "official" data on apprehensions
and expulsions, it is estimated that the number of mostly Central Americans
removed from Mexico during the first 11 months of 1994 averages 5,000 to 6,000
per month (Dec. MN).  There were reportedly 143,000 illegal aliens removed from
Mexico in 1993, and 90,000 in 1990.<p>
<p>
 Mexico's National Migration Institute reported that 3,651 illegal aliens were
"deported" between January and November, suggesting that most illegal aliens
are removed from Mexico informally rather than after a legal process.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
Mexico issues about 125,000 work permits to foreign workers each year.  A
public education is guaranteed to all children in Mexico, but most schools
require a birth certificate or a passport and visa to establish the identity of
the child.  This means that the children of illegal aliens are often barred
from Mexican public schools.  There have been roundups at hospitals to which
undocumented Central Americans go to seek medical treatment. <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
Many of the illegal aliens in Mexico are Guatemalans employed in jobs that
range from picking coffee beans to construction and maids.  Violations of
Mexico's minimum wage, and of basic human rights standards, are reportedly
widespread where illegal Central Americans are employed.  <p>
<p>
There have been charges that Central Americans suffer rapes, beatings,
extortion, and robbery at the hands of Mexican employers and police.  One
advocate for unauthorized Central Americans in Mexico is Tapachula bishop Jorge
Arizmendi, who hopes that Prop. 187 will put Mexico's treatment of undocumented
workers onto Mexico's national agenda.  Some immigrants from Central America
say that they were treated far worse in Mexico  than the US. <p>
<p>
The potential embarrassment from these complaints to President Zedillo after
his denunciations of Prop. 187 reportedly prompted the Mexican government to
undertake a thorough review of its immigration policies and their enforcement.
In the past, Mexico has ignored Central Americans passing through to the US,
but now that some are apparently staying in relatively wealthier Mexico, the
government feels compelled to act.  Mexico has increased the number of
roadblocks near its border with Guatemala.<p>
<p>
Mexican GDP per capita ($3470 in 1992) is 3.5 times the Guatemalan level of
$980; picking coffee beans in Mexico pays twice as much as the same job in
Guatemala.  About 40,000 Guatemalans live in camps for political refugees in<p>
the state of Campeche.  During his campaign, President Zedillo had promised
more public spending to help the Mexican poor and to offset the inequality that
accompanied Mexico's boom, and lower interest rates to spur foreign and
domestic investment in Mexican factories, housing, and infrastructure.  <p>
<p>
Mexico was headed for a deficit in its current account trade balance of $30
billion in 1994, equivalent to almost eight percent of its $395 billion GDP.
Its reserves fell from $30 billion early in 1994 to $6 billion on December 22
as Mexico attempted to support the peso at a rate of 3.45 pesos to $1.
Nonetheless, Mexico's new Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, confidently
predicted in mid-December that the economy would grow by four percent in 1995,
and that the peso-dollar exchange rate would remain stable.  <p>
<p>
On December 19, Zapatista rebels reported falsely that they had taken over 38
towns in Chiapas.  On December 20, Mexico devalued the peso, and it eventually
fell over 40 percent, from 3.4 pesos to $1 to 5.7 pesos to $1, before settling
at 5 pesos to $1 on December 29.  Mexican interest rates jumped to 40 percent,
credit dried up as banks stopped lending, the Mexican stock market fell
sharply, and there were fears that Mexico would not have enough dollars to pay
the interest it owes on its foreign debts.<p>
<p>
According to the estimates of University of California, Davis economist Ed
Taylor, a 10 percent devaluation of the peso could increase Mexico-to-US
migration by 17 percent (March MN).  If this village-based estimate proves to
be correct, there is likely to be a surge in Mexico-to-US migration.<p>
<p>
The Mexican explanation for the devaluation--to offset the capital flight
associated with Zapatista activity in Chiapas-- was described in the US as an
attempt to cover-up fundamental economic problems.  Some predicted that the
peso devaluation would be a blow to foreigners' confidence in the Mexican
economy.  Foreigners have $75 billion invested in Mexican financial markets,
and there were fears of a capital flight in 1995..  <p>
<p>
Mexico plans more privatization and stricter enforcement of rules designed to
promote competition in 1995, but it remains dependent on foreign investment for
the job creation needed to absorb one million new workforce entrants each year.
Mexican exports and internal savings are not sufficient to pay for the
country's imports, making Mexico dependent on an inflow of foreigners' savings.
As interest rates rose in the US and elsewhere, speculators bet that Mexico too
would have to raise interest rates, and that rising rates would slow economic
growth in Mexico, forcing Mexico to devalue the peso.  <p>
<p>
Devaluing the peso makes Mexican exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign
buyers, but it also fuels inflation in Mexico.  The Mexican government has
promised to cut government spending and allow interest rates to rise to prevent
an inflationary surge, but this means that the country risks recession that may
also reduce the attractiveness of the country to foreigners.<p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Another
Bracero Program Considered</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 13, the Inter-American Institute on Migration and Labor organized a
meeting of 25 farm worker advocates in Washington DC to discuss the possibility
of a foreign worker program with Mexico.  Even though it was agreed that there
were far more signs of labor surplus than shortage, it was noted that the two
blades of the scissors could come together quickly to produce a program.<p>
<p>
Outgoing President Salinas and Governor Wilson in November, 1994 called for a
guestworker program that would allow Mexican workers to be employed in the US.
Salinas justified a program in terms of protecting the inevitable flow of
Mexican workers to the US; Wilson in terms of having workers come legally, and
managing their access to public services ( Dec. 1994 MN).<p>
<p>
US employers are currently allowed to recruit unskilled foreign workers to fill
vacant US jobs only after they convince the US Department of Labor that, after
a search for US workers at prevailing wages, and the offer of  benefits such as
free housing to temporary foreign farmworkers, no US workers are available.
Since 1990, there have been 35,000 to 40,000 unskilled foreign workers admitted
each year.  About half fill farm jobs, and half fill nonfarm jobs.<p>
<p>
Temporary alien farm workers are admitted under the H-2A program, and they cut
sugar cane in Florida, harvest tobacco in the Carolinas, pick apples in the
Northeast, and herd sheep in the West.  Many farm employers and most farm
worker advocates decry the H-2A program--the farmers because of DOL's role in
certifying--and perhaps rejecting--their need for foreign workers on a
job-by-job basis, and the advocates because DOL allegedly does not do enough to
assure that farmers truly recruit American workers.<p>
<p>
If labor shortages develop in Spring, 1995, and INS border controls are
perceived to have reduced significantly illegal immigration at the border, then
pressures could mount for a non-H-2A foreign worker program.  <p>
<p>
Farm worker advocates at the meeting discussed the elements of such a program
if one should be proposed.  One suggestion was to push for more effective labor
law enforcement to encourage employers to prefer Americans, but it was quickly
agreed that complaint-driven and money-assessment-evaluated enforcement can
have only limited effects on a farm labor market that matches one to two
million seasonal workers with three to four million seasonal jobs.  <p>
<p>
Some argued that, if there were to be a non-H-2A foreign worker program, it
should be a RAW-type program, under which foreign workers would gradually earn
the right to become immigrants by doing e.g., at least 90 days of farm work for
two or three years. <p>
<p>
It was generally agreed that IRCA and IRCA-sponsored research has changed both
the reality and the perception of the farm labor market.  The reality is that
most farmworkers, and virtually all new entrants to the farm work force, are
born abroad--the base "states" for US migrants have switched from Florida,
Texas, and California to central and southern Mexico.  The only disputed point
was the share of unauthorized workers in the stable farm work force--the range
of hard-to-verify estimates is 10 to 50 percent.  There is general agreement
that the share of unauthorized workers is rising, but the most credible
evidence available today points to smaller percentages of unauthorized aliens.
<p>
<p>
The seasonal farm labor market is increasingly disorganized.  As intermediaries
such as labor contractors assume a greater role in job matching, more workers
wind up working only a few hours per day, and a few days each week, even during
peak periods.  Second, the farm labor market has gotten so isolated that
non-marginal changes in wages and working arrangements would likely be required
to end the industry's dependence on immigrant workers without other US jobs
options.  However, if there were to be such non-marginal adjustments, the
demand for labor might fall sharply, via e.g., mechanization or trade.<p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Gatekeeper
Reduces Apprehensions</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper, an experiment to
flood the westernmost section of the US-Mexican border with three lines of
agents to have a better chance of apprehending aliens attempting entry south of
San Diego.  Apprehensions along the six miles of border between the Highway 5
port of entry to the Pacific Ocean fell by half in October and November, from
600 to 800 per night to 200 to 300 per night.<p>
<p>
As apprehensions fall in the  most heavily guarded western sections of the
border, they are rising further east.  Overall apprehensions are down about 30
percent from year-earlier figures, but up sharply--over 100 percent--in what
were previously quiet mountain and desert areas.  There has also been a
significant increase in aliens attempting entry with counterfeit documents.<p>
<p>
Experts agree that the real test of Gatekeeper's effectiveness will come in
Spring, 1995, when aliens who are going home for Christmas attempt to return to
seasonal US jobs.  There may be more Mexicans attempting entry than usual
because of the December peso devaluation.<p>
<p>
In yet another report on "one of the Government's most troubled agencies" (Oct.
MN), the New York Times reported that the INS was promoting rather than
disciplining senior managers accused of sexual harassment and assault.  <p>

at the Summit of the Americas</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
President Clinton told the 34 leaders of Western Hemisphere countries that he
would like to see a free trade zone from Alaska to Argentina by 2005, but
newly-elected Mexican President Zedillo insisted on discussing immigration
during the Summit of the Americas on December 9-11, 1994 in Miami.  <p>
<p>
Several Central American leaders denounced Proposition 187, the California
initiative approved on November 8 that establishes a state-run verification
system to ensure that illegal aliens do not receive state-funded public
services.  Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon called Prop 187 "a flagrant
and<p>
massive violation of human rights, especially for children."<p>
<p>
Vice President Gore reminded reporters that the Clinton Administration opposed
187, and asserted that the real answer to illegal immigration is to "is to
create more opportunities for jobs and lives with dignity in the areas from
which the immigration is taking place."<p>
<p>
The 35 Western Hemisphere nations--many are small island nations-- have a
combined population of about 875 million and a combined GNP of about $8
trillion.  The US, with a $6 trillion GNP, accounts for three-fourths of all
economic activity in the region, followed by Canada ($566 billion), Brazil
($425 billion), and Mexico ($295 billion).  Clinton cited figures indicating
that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect January
1, 1994, increased U.S. exports to Mexico by 22 percent and created more than
100,000 new US jobs.  US export-related jobs pay 17 percent more than average
US wages.<p>
<p>
Political commentator Robert Novak argued that Mexican President Zedillo openly
asserted that Mexico needs the outlet of the US labor market for its nationals,
and that Mexico will push for some type of guestworker program.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Cubans
Riot in Panama</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
On December 8, about 1,000 of the 8,500 Cubans being held in Panama rioted to
protest what they argued was the slow pace at which their cases were being
handled.  Over 200 American soldiers were injured, and hundreds of Cubans
escaped into the jungle.  By December 9, almost all of the escaped Cubans had
been re-captured. Two were found dead in the Panama Canal. <p>
<p>
Some of the 22,000 Cubans at the US Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba, rioted
on September 6.  There are also 4900 Haitians in Guantanamo--14, 650 have
returned to Haiti, and 25 were sent to the US for humanitarian reasons.<p>
The riots were allegedly sparked by the Clinton Administration's decision on
December 2 to admit Cuban families with children directly to the US, even
though, in August 1994, President Clinton asserted forcefully that Cubans could
come to the US only after being screened in Havana.  INS Commissioner Meissner
stressed that only children for whom continued living in the camps would
constitute "extreme hardship" would be admitted with their families to the US.
Living in tents and not attending school are not considered by the INS to be
"extreme hardship."<p>
<p>
There are about 3,000 children under 17 in the camps, and it is estimated that
8,000 or one-fourth of the Cubans being detained could be admitted directly to
the US under this "humanitarian" program.  The Clinton Administration maintains
that the 4,900 Haitians still in Guantanamo, 234 of whom are unaccompanied
children, will not be admitted to the US.  On December 19, a US appeals court
upheld the government's decision not to admit these children, and reversed a
lower court ruling that guaranteed refugee advocates access to Cubans and
Haitians in Guantanamo, although the government said that lawyers would still
be permitted in Guantanamo.<p>
<p>
In October 1994, the Clinton Administration made the first exception to its
only-visa-Cuba immigration policy when 300 elderly and sick Cuban refugees at
Guantanamo and their close family members, as well as 45 children without
relatives, were taken directly to the US.  So far, almost 700 Cubans have been
moved from Guantanamo to the US.<p>
<p>
On December 20, a US Appeals Court lifted at least temporarily all restrictions
on returning Cubans from Guantanamo to Cuba.  Refugee advocates persuaded a
judge to stop such voluntary returns until it is determined whether persons
seeking US asylum at US facilities outside the US have US constitutional
rights.<p>

Lawsuit Thrown Out</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Florida was the first state to sue the federal government for reimbursement of
the costs of providing education, health, and justice services to unauthorized
immigrants.  On December 20, a federal judge threw out the state's lawsuit,
saying that the suit presented a "political issue" that he had no authority to
decide.  Florida's suit contended that the US government encourages illegal
immigration by not effectively controlling US borders and then requiring states
to provide services to them.  Florida's governor promised to appeal.<p>

Florida estimates that it spent $2.5 billion in 1993 to provide services to all
types of immigrants, including $884 million to provide services to 345,000
unauthorized immigrants.  <p>
<p>
A federal judge in Texas indicated that he too is inclined to dismiss that
state's suit for reimbursement.  However, California's Governor Wilson said
that the dismissal of Florida's lawsuit does not affect California's pending
lawsuit because California raises different claims.  California has three suits
pending in federal court in San Diego that seek as much as $10.5 billion in
federal reimbursement for the cost of providing services to unauthorized

<a name="RTFToC11">Immigration
in the 104th Congress</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), who lost by one vote his bid to be his party's
number two person in the US Senate, announced that he would oppose Republican
efforts to deny public benefits to legal aliens.  About half of the projected
savings in the Republican proposal to reform welfare--an estimated $21 billion
over five years-- would come from denying <u>legal </u>immigrants access to 60
federally-funded programs, from housing assistance to food assistance to legal
services, until they became naturalized US citizens.  Refugees would be exempt
for their first six years in the US, as would legal immigrants over 75 who have
been in the US  for at least five years.  <p>
<p>
There has been a great deal of discussion of the "quality" or integration
prospects of 1980s immigrants.  According to a Wall Street Journal summary,
this research casts "doubt on the widely held view that immigration is always a
net plus for the economy."  A Rand analyst asserted that adult immigrants who
enter the US labor market earning 30 percent less than US workers are likely to
leave the labor market still earning 30 percent less.<p>
<p>
University of California, San Diego Professor George Borjas has released
another paper that finds that recent immigrants are less educated and skilled
persons who "assimilate into welfare" in the US.  Despite the fact that the
Census includes illegal aliens and newly legalized aliens who are not eligible
for welfare, Borjas found that in the 1990 Census, 9.1 percent of all immigrant
households, but only 7.4 percent of US-born households, reported receiving
payments from welfare programs in 1989.  In their first years in the US,
foreign-born households (except refugees) are often not eligible for welfare,
so the percentage of households reporting welfare payments increases with time
in the US.  About 5.5 percent of those who immigrated between 1965 and 1970
reported receiving welfare in 1969, but 10 percent of this immigrant cohort
reported receiving welfare between 1980 and 1990.  <p>
<p>
Borjas points to the immigrants' fewer years of education, and thus low
earnings, as the reason why welfare usage rises over time.  An alternative
explanation may be changes in eligibility.  In the 1960s, there were still
residence requirements in many states that required a person to live for six to
12 months in the area before applying for welfare.  Similarly, the 1990 Census
asked about welfare usage in 1989, when about one-third of the 1980s immigrants
were newly-legalized aliens who were not eligible for welfare assistance until,
in most cases, 1993. <p>
<p>
Immigrants from Eastern Europe interviewed by a Wall Street Journal reporter
rejected the notion that they come to the US to receive federal benefits; some
note that countries such as Canada are far more generous to immigrants.  Under
the Republican proposal, legal immigrants already enrolled in assistance
programs would have one year to transition to US citizenship, if they are
eligible. <p>
<p>
The debate on immigrants and welfare is likely to emphasize that legal
immigration can impose costs on US taxpayers, and thus may lead to efforts to
reduce legal immigration, now running at 900,000 per year.  Simpson also
announced that he would push for the approval of legislation that would cut
planned legal immigration for five years, from 675,000 to 500,000 annually.
Simpson believes that such a cut would give the US "breathing space" to absorb
the recent wave of immigrants.<p>
<p>
Simpson asserted that he would try to repeal the 1966 Cuban American Adjustment
Act, which allows all Cubans who reach US shores to become legal immigrants
after one year.  This may be politically difficult, since many Florida Cubans
are ardent Republicans.<p>
<p>
Finally, Simpson wants to win approval for a counterfeit-resistant
identification system to improve the enforcement of employer sanctions.
Simpson also announced his opposition to Prop. 187's denial of education to
illegal alien children.<p>
<p>
In the House, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) has been named chair of the
Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims.  Smith has promised to "work diligently
to write a bipartisan solution to the problem of illegal immigration."<p>
<p>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) has been named chair of a special congressional task
force on immigration reform.  The task force, whose membership has yet to be
determined, will work with the Governors of border states to draft legislation
to deal with immigration issues. <p>
<p>
Court decisions make it clear that Congress, but not the states, can deny
benefits to legal and illegal immigrants.  However, the US has traditionally
talked of "we the people" rather than "we US citizens." The Bill of Rights, for
example, defines the rights of people, not citizens, because the founding
fathers were citizens of individual states rather than the US.<p>
<p>
The debate within Republican circles over immigration continues, with Jack Kemp
and William Bennett arguing that Prop. 187-style efforts to discourage illegal
immigration by denying them services is wrong-headed and will push immigrants
into the Democratic party, repeating historic party mistakes such as opposing
the civil rights movement.  They would admit immigrants, but end bilingualism
and affirmative action programs that permit immigrants to get special
preferences under programs originally created to remedy governmental
discrimination against Blacks.<p>
<p>
Governor Wilson and William Buckley, on the other hand, believe that the
Republican party should embrace efforts to limit immigration.<p>

<a name="RTFToC12">H-1B
Final Rules</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The US Department of Labor issued final regulations governing the employment of
temporary skilled foreigners in the US.  There were 110,000 H-1B workers
admitted in FY92, and 93,000 in FY93.  In 1993, 14 percent came from the UK,
and 9 percent were from Japan.<p>
<p>
The regulations, published in the Dec. 20 Federal Register, require US
employers to meet tougher standards to have their need for H-1B workers
certified, and reduce the validity of the H-1B visas from six to three years.
H-1B aliens are persons coming to work temporarily in the United States in
"specialty occupations"--generally professional-level positions requiring at
least a bachelor's degree.  There is to be an annual limit of 65,000 H-1B
visas.<p>
<p>
Most of the disputes over the regulations involved proposals to require labor
contractors who were requesting certification to employ H-1B workers to satisfy
additional steps to certify that there was a genuine shortage of American
workers, and that the employment of the aliens would not displace US workers.
In its final rule, the Department of Labor decided "at this time" not to
establish special procedures for contractors.  The final regulation "is both
less burdensome for employers and more protective of workers" than the original
proposal, the department said.<p>
<p>
In a related story, several employee and lobbying groups are seeking to change
H-1B program, which they allege allowed a company to eliminate jobs in a
Livingston, New Jersey plant and transfer the jobs to immigrant workers in
North Carolina.  The US Department of Labor is investigating North
Carolina-based Syntel, which allegedly employed H-1B  foreign workers in NC.
Syntel claimed that American workers did not have the necessary skills for
certain programming language and software tasks.  Many H-1B foreign workers are
computer programmers and physical and occupational therapists.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Immigration
and Population Change in Germany</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 15, 1994, the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and the American Institute
for Contemporary German Studies sponsored a conference in Washington, DC at the
American Enterprise Institute on Population Prospects for United Germany.  The
major conclusion was that the German population, now 81 million, will shrink,
and that the foreigners' share of the population, now eight percent, will
rise.<p>
<p>
Two major demographic issues were discussed.  First, what will Germany's
population be in the 21st century, given that fertility is below replacement
levels and that the country is avowedly not a country of immigration?  Second,
how will the Germans be distributed between the former east and western
sections of the country?<p>
<p>
Under all population projections, Germany's population will shrink, but
immigration is the major demographic variable that will determine by how much
Germany's population shrinks.  Government projections assume that 225,000
ethnic German Aussiedler per year will arrive until the year 2000, and then
their number will gradually decrease, so that none arrive in 2011.  Even though
Germany is not a country of immigration, it permits Germans and foreigners
living in the country to unify their families, so population projections have
three immigration scenarios:  100,000 net immigrants per year, 200,000, and
300,000.  <p>
<p>
Germany does not distinguish between foreigners and natives in its population
projections.  However, assuming that fertility throughout united Germany
converges to the West German rate of 1.4 by 1996, that mortality converges by
2030, that there are 300,000 net new immigrants per year, and that Germany does
not change its naturalization laws and practices, in 2030 the population would
shrink to 77 million, and foreigners would be 20 percent of all residents.  <p>
<p>
If a net 400,000 foreigners arrived each year, and naturalizations remain at
current levels, foreigners would be 30 percent of the population in 2030.  This
means that, in some cities, foreigners are likely to be a majority of the
population under current naturalization rates and policies.  Some assert that
well before Germany reached Swiss levels of foreigners--about 17
percent--naturalization laws and procedures would change.<p>
<p>
Where will Germany's shrinking population live?  At unification in 1990, there
were about 16 million East Germans and 63 million West Germans.  Since
unification, marriage and fertility rates in the East have fallen
sharply--further than they fell after World War II--and mortality has risen
sharply.  <p>
<p>
This demographic shock in the east is expected to  be short-lived.  Much of the
fertility decline is due to young women marrying later and postponing children.
One reason why marriages and births declined by 65 percent since 1989 is
because the demographic transition to capitalism was compressed in East
Germany, compared to the more gradual adjustments to the market in Poland and
other East European nations.  After East German women adjust to the 3 C's of
career, consumption, and childbirth, their marriage and fertility behavior is
expected to return to (low) West German levels.<p>
<p>
East Germany in the 21st century may no longer include one in five Germans.<b>
</b> Between 1989 and 1993, some 1.3 million East Germans moved West, and
250,000 persons in the West moved East, for a net internal migration of over
one million.  <p>
<p>
Even if young East German women who today seem to be delaying childbirth begin
having children in their late 20s and early 30s, as expected, the fact that
virtually all immigrants currently go to West Germany means that the East
German share of the German population is likely to shrink.  If there were no
more internal migration after 2005, and fertility and mortality converge as
expected, East Germany would still shrink from about 16 million in 1990 to 13
million by 2010, and older than average East German residents would represent
about one in six Germans.<p>

Seekers in Germany</a>
</a></h2>
 <p>
In November, 12,056 aliens requested asylum in Germany, bringing the total for
the first 11 months of 1994 to 114,024.  Almost one-fourth of the November 1994
applicants were from the ex-Yugoslavia, and one-fifth were from Turkey.<p>
<p>
Of the 26,343 asylum cases decided in November, 8.3 percent were approved.  So
far in 1994, there have been decisions on 324,682 applications for asylum, and
there are another 119,076 cases awaiting decisions.  Beginning December 8,
nationals of the Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso require a
visa to visit Germany.<p>
<p>
Germany spent a reported DM 15.5 billion ($10 billion) on the 400,000 persons
from the former Yugoslavia who are in Germany in 1994, or $25,000 each. <p>
<p>
Several of Germany's 16 Laender have begun charging asylum seekers whose
applications have been rejected the costs of their deportation.  However, only
5 to 10 percent of the failed asylum seekers actually pay.  Removing aliens who
do not have the right to stay in Germany is the responsibility of individual
Laender.<p>
<p>
Germany announced that to protest Turkey's sentencing eight Kurdish members of
parliament to prison terms for their alleged involvement with the Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK), no Kurds would be returned to Turkey between December 12,
1994 and January 20, 1995.  The FDP announced that it may try to get the ban on
deportations extended, and the German Green party called for an economic
embargo on Turkey and the granting of residence rights to Kurds in Germany.
New Turkish Foreign Minister Soysal rejected criticism of Turkey's treatment of
"the Kurdish problem."  Turkey did not accept the 10 percent of the US's $360
million in military aid for FY95 that was tied to Turkey's improvement of its
human rights record.<p>
 <p>
German Labor Minister Norbert Blum is planning to change rules and enforcement
that have allowed up to 100,000 British construction workers to be employed in
Germany and not pay German Social Security taxes.  The UK, joined by Portugal,
blocked a European Commission plan to provide the same wages and  employment
rights for workers "assigned" by their employers in other member states as
those that apply to local workers.  This allegedly permitted low wage British
construction workers to displace German construction workers.<p>
<p>
The Institute of German Business (IW) of Cologne surveyed German businesses and
concluded that foreigners were successfully integrated into schools, training,
and jobs.  Many foreign workers have been employed by the same companies for
years, and integration in the workplace is marked by tolerance and
understanding.  The language barrier has lessened over time, making for
relatively trouble-free communication.<p>
<p>
CSU leader Peter Gauweiler in Munich has called for an immigration law that
distinguishes family, ethnic Germans, and humanitarian immigrants, and limits
overall immigration in a US quota manner.  Gauweiler complained that every year

<p>
Other CSU politicians attacked this proposal.  Some termed any immigration
undesirable given Germany's high unemployment rate and housing shortages, while
others argued that Gauweiler's proposal was meant to obscure his real
anti-immigrant position. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">EU
Immigration Priorities</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 22, 1994, nine EU nations agreed in Berlin to implement the
border-free Schengen agreement on March 26, 1995.  The Schengen Agreement, was
drawn up in 1985, and implementation has been delayed four times.<p>
<p>
The Schengen Information System (SIS) in Strasbourg already includes data on
700,000 criminals and other undesirables. <p>
<p>
EU General Affairs Council directive COM(94)38 requires member states to permit
settled nationals from within the EU to vote and to run for local office,
opening the possibility of, e.g., a non-German Spanish mayor in Germany.  EU
citizens already have the right to vote locally for members of the European
Parliament.  France, Luxembourg and Belgium have been granted exceptions
because, e.g., mayors in France have some law enforcement powers, so that only
French citizens may be elected mayor.   In Luxembourg and Belgium, EU nationals
must be residents for six years before they can vote in local elections.<p>
<p>
The French, who assume the Presidency of the EU effective January 1, 1995, have
been asked to deal quickly with a long list of difficult immigration issues:
the sharing between EU members of the burden resulting from the hosting of
refugees, the development of common legal guarantees for asylum seekers, the
uniform interpretation of the term "refugee," and determining which country is
responsible for each asylum application filed, according to the Dublin
Convention.<p>
<p>
In the past, it has proven to be hard to get the required unanimous approval of
12 (15 after Jan. 1, 1995) interior and foreign affairs ministers on these
issues.<p>
<p>
Seven countries have agreed to remove passport controls between them as of
March 26, 1995.  The Schengen Accord will also introduce a standard visa valid
in all the member countries and create a single information system for the
police system. Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal will implement the accord in March, while Italy and Greece will join
later.  Freer travel restrictions between the Schengen states will be
counterbalanced by tougher identity checks at borders with non-EU nations to
counter crime and illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
Britain is opposed to an EU directive that would require standard treatment of
foreign workers in EU countries.  <p>
<p>
At the European Union summit in Essen, Germany, police detained 500 to 600
people marched against EU immigration policies.  The EU announced new programs
to accelerate development of the EU's Mediterranean rim.  <p>
<p>
Albania provides an example of the challenge.  The 3.4 million residents have
an average annual GDP of less than $500.  The country received about $290
million in foreign investment in 1993, only one-third as much as 600,000
Albanians abroad sent home in remittances.  Some hope to turn Albania into a
tourist destination for sun-seekers, but many beaches are not reachable by
road, and there are 750,000 concrete bunkers at others built to repel
invaders.<p>

<a name="RTFToC19">IOM
Reports on Trafficking, Transit Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The IOM reports that aliens are paying $300 to $30,000 each to be smuggled into
their country of choice.  They have created a migrant smuggling business that
generates $5 to $7 billion annually, according to papers presented at the 11th
seminar on migration held by the International Organization for Migration in
Geneva October 26-28, 1994.  The lowest fees are paid to smuggle aliens across
land borders, as with the $300 fee often paid to cross the US-Mexican border,
and the highest fees are paid to be smuggled long distances, as from China to
the US via southeast Asia and Latin America.<p>
<p>
The alien smuggling business requires an alien who is willing to pay to be
smuggled across borders and a smuggler or intermediary willing to take the
payment and at least attempt the smuggling.  Many alien smugglers also move
other items across borders, including drugs, since they already have false
documents, safe houses, and methods of arriving in remote areas of the
destination country.<p>
<p>
As industrial countries tighten their immigration controls, and pressures to
emigrate rise, the cost of migrating illegally and the potential profits of
alien smugglers also increase.  Migrants seeking a better life may wind up in
the clutches of often brutal international crime syndicates-- the reputation of
such organizations for revenge makes them reluctant witnesses against smugglers
even if they are detected.  <p>
<p>
Some 230 delegates representing 70 governments and 40 international
organizations agreed that fighting international alien smuggling syndicates
should become a higher priority on national and international agendas.  In
waging this fight, it was noted frequently that the rights of migrants should
be protected, and that the demand for migrant services should be reduced as
much as possible by creating other options for migrants to enter industrial
countries.<p>
<p>
On the international level, governments were urged to see alien smuggling for
what it is--a growth industry that permits often criminal elements to capture
the 10 or 20 to 1 income gaps between emigration and immigration countries.
Freer trade and capital flows eliminated many of the profits to smugglers of
goods and capital, and governments must realize that, if there is uneven
development in an increasingly integrated world in which migration is
restricted, they will have to place a high priority on combating alien
smuggling.  <p>
<p>
Specific steps urged were the international exchange of data on alien
smugglers, agreements between countries on the return of migrants to their
countries of origin, and coordinated law enforcement efforts to deal with
international aliens smuggling syndicates.  Longer term measures to accelerate
stay-at-home development were also recommended.<p>
<p>
A study on transit migration in Hungary released by the International
Organization for Migration reports that up to two million migrants are living
in Central Europe who want to move to the West.  Their number is continuing to
grow, because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, and immigration regulations
in Western Europe strand migrants in Central Europe. <p>
<p>
Over 70 percent of the migrants questioned about their future plans wanted to
move West; 60 percent said they would go to any Western nation. Germany and
Austria are the favored destinations for people from Eastern Europe; the US is
preferred by those from the former Soviet Union.  In Hungary, an estimated
70,000 to 100,000 foreigners are working illegally.  Most are young single men;
60 percent are college educated.  The Hungarian government will issue 2,000
immigration permits for 1995.  <p>
<p>
IOM is an international organization that helps member states to manage
migration, that conducts research on international migration, and that
encourages social and economic development via migration.  A summary of the
conference papers on alien smuggling will be published in International
Migration, Vol. 4 for 1994, and are available from IOM, PO Box 71, CH-1211

<a name="RTFToC30">Managing
Migration in Japan</a></h2>
The 15th Nihon University International Symposium brought together 70
researchers and policy makers from December 5-7, 1994 to discuss the problems
involved in managing migration during the Pacific century.  Nihon is the
largest university in Japan--it has about 5,000 professors and 80,000 students
on 14 campuses--and it differs from other Japanese universities in its concern
for issues throughout Asia.<p>
<p>
Most of the papers dealt with the challenge of managing migration to Japan.  By
all measures, the number of foreigners entering Japan has been rising sharply.
The number of foreign arrivals in 1992 was four million, the number of
foreigners registered as living in the country was 1.3 million, and the number
of foreigners who overstayed the tourist visas most foreigners use to enter
Japan was about 300,000.  <p>
<p>
The focus of most papers was on foreigners who work in Japan.  There are only
about 100,000 legal foreigners among the country's 62 million workers.  About
one-fourth of these legal foreign workers are entertainers, one-fourth are
engaged in international services, including teaching English, and 10 percent
are engineers.  <p>
<p>
Japan does not permit the importation of unskilled foreign workers, but there
are believed to be 300,000 to 500,000 illegal foreign workers in the country,
mostly filling so-called 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult.  Over
60,000 foreign workers were apprehended in 1992 and 1993, and two-thirds were
from three countries--Malaysia, Iran, and Korea--with each country accounting
for about 14,000 apprehensions.  About four-fifths of the illegal foreign
workers were men, and half of them were working in construction,--another
one-fourth were detected working in factories.  One-third of the women detected
were hostesses, and another one-sixth were working in factories.<p>
<p>
Japan is well aware of the gap between its policy of no unskilled foreign
workers and the reality that at least several hundred thousand such workers are
at work.  However, there seems to be little consensus for a large-scale
immigration solution.  If legal immigration to Japan were at British levels of
0.1 percent of the population, Japan would accept about 125,000 immigrants
annually.  If Japan took as many immigrants as the US, it would accept 500,000
immigrants annually, adding about 0.4 percent to the population annually via
immigration.<p>
<p>
There also seems to be in Japan little enthusiasm for a German-style
guestworker system, through which about 10 percent of the workforce in Germany
eventually became foreign workers.  In the Japanese case, this would imply
about six million foreign workers.  The major fear of adopting the German
probationary immigrant system--workers who proved to be satisfactory could have
their work and residence permits renewed, and send for their families--is the
settlement of "incompatible foreigners."<p>
<p>
Japan has not totally rejected the immigration and guestworker options.  There
are 150,000 mostly Brazilian descendants of turn-of-the-century Japanese
emigrants to South America in Japan, and about 100,000 legal foreign workers.
But there is little possibility that these systems will be used to admit more
than perhaps 500,000 foreign workers.<p>
<p>
Instead of opening the front door to legal immigrants, or the guestworker side
door, Japan seems most likely to tolerate unauthorized workers and to accept
foreign workers through trainee and student sidedoors.  If backdoor and
non-labor market sidedoors turn out to be the major avenues through which
foreign workers enter Japan, then Japan will be charting a new path to managing
migration, implicitly asserting that the unskilled foreign workers present in
the country are unwanted or that they are simply acquiring skills to be used at
home.<p>
<p>
It is not clear that the Japanese attempt to use trainee, student, and
toleration-of-unauthorized worker policies will prove durable in the 21st
century.  There are fears that these polices, singly or in combination, could
generate immigrant settlement in Japan and socio-economic problems<p>
<p>
There was a great deal of discussion of the trainee program.  Since 1954, the
Japanese government has had a program under which young Asians could enter the
country to receive training that would accelerate their country's development.
Japanese firms that invested abroad used this program to train future country
managers since the 1950s.<p>
<p>
But over the past five years, small Japanese firms that have never invested
abroad have become dependent on foreign trainees.  There are 40,000 trainees
employed in Japan in 1994.  About 90 percent are Asian, including 40 percent
from China.  Most--83 percent --are employed in manufacturing, usually by small
and medium-sized firms.  The trainees are generally very well educated by the
standards of their countries of origin.<p>
<p>
Many prominent Japanese advocate expanding the trainee system to permit up to
500,000 foreigners to enter Japan.  To most outside observers, this would mean
that Japan is opening itself to foreign workers, although calling them
trainees.  Trainees get paid $400 to $800 monthly, or just one-fourth to
one-half as much as Japanese workers.  The quality and content of the training
is left up to each firm, so there is room for abuse in both training and in the
housing that employers are required to provide trainees.  Finally, there is
supposed to be a one-year limit on how long trainees can stay in Japan,
although employers are pushing for a two-year limit.<p>
<p>
There was general agreement that the problem of managing immigration--which
results from rapid growth and labor shortages--is far preferable to the
alternative of emigration pressures.  However, there was widespread criticism
of the short-term perspective through which most Asian policy makers evaluate
migration issues, producing many skeptics of the notion that there will be yet
another Asian miracle in finding a mutually beneficial way to manage labor
migration and avoid unanticipated results.<p>

Foreigners in Japan</a></h2>
A private panel on December 26 recommended to the Justice Ministry that Japan
increase the number of foreign workers with specialized skills, and also
increase efforts to detect and deport illegal aliens.  The panel noted that
1990 revisions to Japan's immigration laws have increased the number of
foreigners overstaying their visas.<p>
<p>
Since a September crackdown, some 2365 illegal foreigners--1,442 men and 923
women--have been deported from Japan.  Most were apprehended while working in
or near Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.  One-quarter (509) of those apprehended were
from South Korea, 363 were Thais, and 292 were Chinese.<p>
<p>
Four unions in the Tokyo area are expected to call for equal treatment of
foreign workers under labor laws in a paper to be released in February 1995.
Between April 1993 and March 1994, 404 cases of work-related problems involving
foreign workers were brought to the four unions.  Over one-third of the
complaints involved unpaid wages, and another one-third involved layoffs.<p>
<p>
In Tokyo, a Chinese illegal alien who sued authorities for injuries she
received during an October 31, 1994 immigration raid was deported.  The Justice
Ministry has ordered an inquiry into allegations that Japanese immigration
officials frequently use violence against foreign detainees.  In late December,
two Chinese illegal aliens were given jail sentences for visa violations; one
arrived on a two-year student visa six years ago.<p>
<p>
Thailand's foreign minister personally gave 20,000 baht ($800) to the families
of two Thai workers who committed suicide in Japan in 1994.  Both Thais paid
200,000 baht each to job brokers, who then left them to fend for themselves in
Japan.<p>
<p>
The Thai government has launched an educational campaign to help prevent Thai
workers from being deceived by job brokers about the prospects for work in
Japan.  There are believed to be 50,000 Thais living illegally in Japan.<p>
<p>
There are reported to be hundreds of "orphans" in Japan, usually the children
of illegal alien women and Japanese men.  They are non-persons in Japan.<p>
<p>
According to one summary, the Japanese believe themselves to be descended from
a sun goddess, and there is reportedly widespread agreement that the Japanese
gene pool must be protected from contamination.  In order to be a Japanese
citizen from birth, a Japanese father must acknowledge his paternity before the
foreign woman gives birth.  In some cases, children of Japanese mother and a
foreign father can be considered Japanese.  <p>
<p>
A missionary couple was able to use a 19th century law to persuade the Japanese
Supreme Court to grant citizenship to a baby they adopted after it was
abandoned by a woman believed to be a Filipino prostitute.  Local officials
reportedly conducted one -year checks of two and three year olds to determine
whether they had criminal records that might invalidate their naturalization
applications.<p>
<p>
Aliens can petition for Japanese citizenship after three years of lawful
residence, but the Catch 22 is that Japan allegedly does not permit three years
of lawful residence to persons likely to apply for naturalization.<p>

<h2>
Planters--Open Malaysia to Foreign Workers</a></h2>
A leading planter on December 6 argued that Malaysia should allow a free flow
of workers among the six ASEAN countries to resolve labor shortages and
surpluses.  A. Navamunkundan of the National Union of Plantation Workers
(NUPW), one of the world's largest farm worker unions, countered that the
solution to plantation labor shortages in Malaysia is "to uplift the image of
the plantation industry by providing high wages and good employment benefits
for the workers."  If plantations were considered "industrial agriculture,"
they might be expected to pay factory wages and attract workers now pouring
into electronics and other factories.<p>
<p>
One official criticized the rubber industry for not adopting the labor-saving
tools developed by the Rubber Research Institute.  Semi-automatic tapping
knives, for example, are cheap, but are not widely used, in part because
foreign workers have been readily available.  According to one official,
Malaysian plantations will have to continue to rely on foreign workers, but
foreign workers should not be considered a long-term solution to labor
shortages.  <p>
<p>
It was estimated that Malaysia has lost over 6,000 bus and truck drivers to
Singapore because of higher wages there.  A political and economic risk service
predicted recently that Malaysia's current labor shortage will affect the
country's competitiveness seriously and prove a real threat to economic growth
in 1995.<p>
<p>
As a result of abuses, Malaysian employers may no longer be allowed to directly
recruit foreign workers, according to the Home Ministry.  After the first
meeting ever held between the Home Ministry and recruitment agencies, it was
announced that there have been cases of Malaysian employers extorting money
from foreign workers coming into the country.<p>
<p>
Since January 1, 1994, Malaysia has banned the recruitment of unskilled and
semi-skilled foreign workers, but permitted exceptions in some cases for
employers who recruit foreign workers directly.  Malaysia requires 70 local for
every 30 foreign workers in most Malaysian workplaces, but grants exceptions to
sectors such as plantations.<p>
<p>
The Human Resources Ministry's Prospective Employment in Manufacturing<p>
survey predicts that, despite current shortages of unskilled workers, by 2000
there will be surpluses of unskilled workers, and shortages of skilled and
professional workers.  Malaysia has one of Asia's highest percentage of foreign
workers, 4 to 10 percent, depending on the estimate, much higher than the
estimated one percent in Taiwan and 0.6 percent in Japan.  Most foreign workers
in Malaysia are unskilled workers in the plantation and construction sectors.

<h2>
Singapore Levies on Foreign Workers</a></h2>
Singapore announced in early December that it would reduce its dependence on
unskilled foreign workers by raising monthly levies for some categories of
unskilled workers, including foreign maids, and reducing them for skilled
foreign workers.  The changes take effect on April 1,1995.<p>
<p>
Employers of foreign workers must pay a monthly levy or tax to the government,
making Singapore one of the few countries to take advantage of wage gaps
between countries to increase its general tax revenues.  Most observers believe
that the wages paid to foreign workers are lower because of the levy.<p>
<p>
Singapore's Labor Minister told builders that "You must be able to steer away
from the mind-set of going for low-cost and low-skilled labor and low-tech
methods."  In November 1992, the construction sector was allowed to use five
foreign workers for each local worker, up from the previous three to one ratio,
but construction productivity did not improve.  Therefore, the levy on
unskilled construction workers will go up by 10 per cent from $S 400 ($275) to
$ 440 a month, while the levy on skilled workers will go down by 20 per cent
from $S 250 to $ 200.  <p>
<p>
Local observers expect subcontractors to be hit hardest by the higher levies.
Many general contractors turn over work at piece-rates to "kepalas" or labor
sub-contractors who hire their own workers--many kepala worker are believed to
be illegal aliens.<p>
<p>
Between January and September 1994, Singapore courts levied fines totaling S$
4.1 million on 278 employers of illegal foreign workers.  In 1993, 415
employers were fined S$ 4.3 million; Singapore expects fines to be higher in
1994.  Employers of illegal alien workers can be fined up to 24 months of the
levy due on them.  With levies running S$ 300 to S$ 450 per month, this makes
fines S$ 7,200 ($4900) and S$ 9,600 per illegal worker.  Employers of illegal
aliens can also be jailed for six months to two years and, if they hired more
than five illegal workers at the same time, caned.<p>
<p>
In early December, courts levied some of the heaviest ever fines, S$16,000 per
illegal alien worker hired at a construction site; S$ 25,200 for hiring two
Malaysians as hairdressers(42 months' levy), S$ 9,600 or 32 months' levy for
hiring a Malaysian illegal worker as a stall assistant, $ 10,500 or 35 months'
levy for employing a food service worker, and S$ 10,500 or 35 months' levy for
employing an illegal Malaysian as a welder..<p>
<p>
The Labor Ministry has promised to monitor closely pick-up points where
employers look for illegal foreign workers. <p>
<p>
In one account of a 2 am police raid on a construction site, 16 of 200 foreign
workers were determined to be illegal aliens.  At another site, 19 illegal
aliens were arrested after the police were called in to break up a fight.<p>
<p>
An illegal Chinese immigrant who entered Singapore in 1943, and married a
Singaporean in 1983, was jailed for three months and one week when it was
discovered that, for several years, he was using a friend's identity card.  He
may not be repatriated, but the Immigration Department stressed that "illegal
immigrants cannot be allowed to settle down in Singapore on the same terms as
permanent residents as this would only encourage many others to resort to
unlawful means to reside here."<p>
<p>
Like many other Asian nations, Singapore has a Central Provident Fund (CPF) to
which employers and workers each contribute 40 percent of their wages.
Singaporean citizens can withdraw of up to 40 percent of their CPF savings to
buy a house, but the estimated 50,000 Malaysian workers and other foreign
workers are only allowed to withdraw their CPF contributions after the age of
55.<p>

<h2>
Export and Import of Workers in Thailand</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Dr. Amara Pongsapich of Chulalongkorn University has called for a Thai
immigration policy that recognizes reality:  Thailand both imports<p>
and export workers in construction, and imports and exports female workers in<p>
the service sector.  The Thai government has recognized the shortage of
professionals, and has allowed unskilled workers entry on a provisional basis.
<p>
<p>
There are an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 illegal foreign workers in
Thailand--most are from Burma, now known as Myanmar.  The Thai immigration
authorities complain that they can detain only 1,500 illegal immigrants, and
that at least two months are required to process the paperwork needed to deport
an illegal immigrant.<p>
<p>
Today's fourth wave of Thai workers who emigrate no longer find riches abroad,
according to Amara.  Recruiters often take one-third of their wages, and they
are subject to exploitation abroad.  This is very different from the first wave
of male and semi-skilled Thais who went to the Middle East in the 1970s, and
the second wave of less skilled males who also&nbsp;went to the Middle East in
the 1980s.  The third wave in the late 1980s saw Thai workers shift toward
Asian destinations, and more women among the migrants.<p>
<p>
The Thai National Security Council estimates that in the past few years 283,500
Burmese, both labor migrants and political dissidents, have entered Thailand.
Burmese seek low-wage jobs in factories, agriculture and fishing boats.
Burmese women find work as maids, in factories or small shops and as
prostitutes.  There are estimates that 10,000 immigrants travel between Rangoon
and Victoria Point on Thai fishing boats earning about 1,500 to 2,000 baht per
month.  The Burmese work first on the fishing trawlers then move onto higher
paying work in construction or shops.  Thai officials acknowledge that
employers take advantage of the illegal Burmese workers who can not complain
due to fears of arrest and deportation. <p>
<p>
In Thailand, some 40,000 to 50,000 Hmong political refugees and asylum-seekers
fear repatriation to Laos under the Luang Prabang Tripartite Agreement (LPTA),
launched in 1991 by the Thai, Laotian and United Nations' High Commissioner for
Refugees with US financing.  In September, 1994, some 5,000 refugees at the Na
Pho camp in northeast Thailand signed a petition sent to the US Congress,
asking it to stop their forced repatriation to Laos.  The Hmong are protesting
the Laotian government's role in where and how they are resettled.<p>

<a name="RTFToC31">Chinese
Migrants</a></h2>
According to some estimates, one-third of China's peasants are idle most of the
year, urban unemployment is between 16 to 20 percent, rural unemployment hovers
around 37 percent and 10 percent of all Chinese workers are internal migrants.
Ten million new people are expected to enter the urban job market in 1995,
while 10 million in state companies have no actual work to do and the number of
rural workers seeing jobs in the city will rise to 30 million, according to the
Chinese Labor Minister. <p>
<p>
Inequality is believed to be a major force motivating internal migration within
and from China.  Those employed in joint-venture factories along China's
southern coast can earn $100 per month, ten times the monthly wage in other
areas of China.  Their wages are rising faster than inflation, which is rising
at about 40 percent per year, while other workers' wages are not.  <p>
<p>
Chinese cities in the booming coastal areas are taxing the wage gap between the
regions by charging internal migrants $3,000 to $10,000 for the residence
permits needed to obtain housing and subsidized food and transportation in them
(Oct. MN).  These richer areas can afford to pay more for food, driving up food
prices everywhere, and investments in the coastal areas appear more promising,
so savings leave poorer regions.  Some speculate that the increasing inequality
between cities and rural areas, and between China's 30 provinces, could fuel
both migration and unrest.<p>
<p>
Shanghai, a city of 7.1 million, has over 3 million temporary residents.
Special organizations offer technical training for migrant workers.  The city
government has developed regulations to manage migrants, and established labor
offices for them.  Nearly 1.35 million people from outside the city have
registered in Shanghai, and 500,000 have received certificates to work.  Over
48,000 people have been sent back to their homes since August, 1994. <p>
<p>
Beijing is also considering legislation to control the capital's 3.4 million
migrants. Laws aimed at controlling crime, transport, public hygiene, and
family planning are expected in 1995.  Beijing has a permanent population of
over 10 million. Fifty-five percent of the temporary population have lived in
the city for over six months, and 23 percent for more than one year. Many of
the workers live in "villages" named after their native provinces and work in
vegetable markets, construction and service industries. <p>

80 percent of them ethnic Koreans -- in South Korea, and their legal status
ranges from legal worker to trainee to illegal alien.<p>

Migrants Return to Vietnam</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
The US trade embargo on Vietnam was lifted in February, 1994, and as many as
10,000 Vietnamese each month are returning for visits to the country that they
or their parents fled to visit friends and relatives and to check out business
opportunities.  Some 800,000 Vietnamese were re-settled in the US.<p>
<p>
The Vietnamese who return, known as "Viet kieu," contribute a large share of
the $600 million annually that flows from the US to Vietnam.  Many are in their
20s and 30s, and use family ties to cut through Vietnam's red tape.  There is
also a return of the elderly, some of whom are able to buy or build the nicest
homes in their village with US pension moneys.<p>
<p>
The Vietnamese exodus, which began in 1975, is finally coming to a close.
About 40,000 Vietnamese remain in camps in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Southeast
Asia, and only about 1,000 of these camp residents are expected to be accepted
by the US before the camps are closed in 1995.  Second, the Amerasian children
of American servicemen, who came to the US directly from Vietnam, has admitted
about 20,000 Amerasians and 60,000 of their family members, and is just about
over.  Third, the refugee program for 35,000 former political prisoners and
about 110,000 family members will end in 1995.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong and Vietnam have had some discussions about the repatriation of boat
people to Vietnam.  On December 16, Vietnam rejected 150 boat people released
from Hong Kong citing nationality problems.  Vietnam has affirmed its
commitment to both voluntary and forced repatriation of screened-out migrants
from Hong Kong, but said it will only accept legal Vietnamese nationals.
Britain would like to resolve the problem of Vietnamese migrants in Hong Kong
prior to 1997. <p>

Vietnam protested on December 12 what it called a "massacre" of Vietnamese
nationals in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge, allegedly under the cover of the
Immigration Law approved by the Cambodian Parliament in August 1994.  The Khmer
Rouge responded that there are four million Vietnamese in Cambodia, and that
all should be expelled.  Cambodia has a population of about 10 million and a
GDP per capita of $250; Vietnam has 73 million people.<p>

Taiwan deported 14 Filipino workers on December 27 for leading a strike at the
Far Eastern Textile factory in Chungli, which was a violation of their work
visas.  In Taiwan, persons who are not union members cannot strike.  <p>
<p>
The factory changed the way it repaid wage deductions unilaterally.  Like many
Taiwanese employers, Far Eastern opened a savings account for each foreign
worker, and deducted wages each month until NT$30,000 ($1150) was
accumulated--workers forfeit the moneys in the savings account if they
(unlawfully) seek new employment.  Instead of repaying the deductions with
interest in a lump sum, the factory decided to repay them in installments over
two months.<p>
<p>
There are believed to be 5000 illegal Filipino workers in Taiwan.  The
Taiwanese government has threatened to locate and deport those who do not leave
voluntarily before a crackdown scheduled to begin&nbsp;before the Chinese New
Year at the end of January<p>

Taiwan has experienced a sharp increase in the number of foreign workers
permitted to enter, but the Council of Labor Affairs Chairman argued that COLA
does not have the resources to manage these foreign workers.  About 12 staff

On December 19, the Industrial Development Bureau approved 18 new "major

<a name="RTFToC33">Illegal
Immigration into South Africa</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are an estimated two million illegal aliens among South Africa's 40
million population, giving the country one of the highest percentages of
illegal residents (five percent)--the US rate would be 1.5 percent if there are
four million illegal aliens present.  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, South
Africa's Home Affairs Minister, blamed illegal immigrants for a crime wave
which he says has reached "almost unmanageable proportions."  South Africa,
which once had stringent border controls to keep out African National Congress
guerrillas, today has very relaxed entry controls, especially for travelers
arriving at night.<p>
<p>
The illegals include persons from nearby countries such as Mozambique,
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola; migrants from West Africa, who are reportedly
involved in smuggling, trading and using hard drugs; and people fleeing the
chaos in Rwanda.  Many Africans who arrive in South Africa as tourists apply
for residence permits once they are in the country.<p>
<p>
Some 57,333 aliens have been sent home between January and September 1994,
including 43,345 from Mozambique and 9,204 from Zimbabwe.  Some 93,600 illegal
immigrants were returned in 1993. <p>
<p>
Some in South Africa reportedly feel the need to accommodate "economic
refugees" after years of being responsible for destabilizing the region.  With
the unemployment rate running 42 percent for those 15 to 30-years old, the
government plans to tighten up border controls and stiffen penalties, including
jail sentences, on employers who hire illegal aliens.  Airlines that bring
passengers who do not have proper documents will also face fines.<p>

are former residents of Vietnam who were forced to return to China.  <p>

Most illegal immigrants are detained until the Immigration Department has
decided whether to accord them asylum as political refugees.  Australia's High

273 days.  Some applicants were held for two or three years, and the government
is considering paying them about $1 for each day there were held.<p>
<p>
Under new legislation, Australia does not grant asylum if the applicant has
already been refused recognition as a political refugee by another country.<p>

There are reportedly 80,000 illegal immigrants in Australia. Most arrived as
tourists or students and overstayed their visas.  <p>
<p>
Australia's 1994-95 immigration target is 73,000, a 16 per cent or 10,000
increase over 1993-94.  For 1995-96, the target will be 84,700.  Australia has

How should the world's leading region of emigration at the beginning of the
20th century deal with the fact that it has become the world's major
destination for immigrants at the end of the 20th century?<p>
<p>
This report, prepared for a Swedish Parliamentary Committee, provides a
valuable overview of immigration into Western Europe that stresses three major
points.  First, the number of persons entering Europe to settle there is at a
post-WWII high of about three million per year--despite all the talk of
Fortress Europe, immigration is up, not down, in the 1990s as compared to the
guestworker 1960s.  Second, about one-half of the annual entrants to Europe are
irregular family or economic migrants.  Third, there is a convergence in both
the reality and policies in all of the rich industrial democracies that asylum
processing must be speeded up, and persons who do not have a legitimate claim
to safe haven are removed promptly, and that more efforts must be made to
reduce illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
The starting point for the report is that immigration to Europe is ratcheting
upward, but that ever-larger immigration flows are not the answer to either
Europe's or the emigration countries' problems.  There are alternatives to
immigration to deal with Europe's demographic and economic problems, and more
children will make Europe "younger" much quicker than even massive immigration.
Second, the immigrants without much education arriving in Europe today may not
do well, given structural changes in the economy.  Third, immigrants are
changing the character of Europe's major cities, threatening to create in them
an underclass that will make downtowns there like US inner cities.<p>
<p>
The report outlines five phases of postwar European immigration.  The first
phase, from the end of WWII to 1964, was marked by the belief that free
movement was mutually beneficial in the evolving "United States of Europe," and
some 500,000 migrants per year moved across borders for at least temporary
stints abroad.  The second or guestworker phase from 1965 to 1972 saw over one
million foreigners per year arriving as probationary immigrants.  The theory
was that, at the  end of their one or two year contracts, they would be rotated
home to their country of origin, and then replaced by another Italian or Turk
if there was still a demand for unskilled labor in northern European factories
and construction sites.<p>
<p>
The third phase from 1973 to 1982 saw numerous efforts to encourage the return
of settled guestworkers ant to restrict the entry of more foreigners.
Immigration fell to about 700,000 annually.<p>
<p>
The fourth phase, from 1983 to 1989, saw an average 1.2 million foreigners
arriving, and many asked for asylum in Europe.  <p>
<p>
The fifth and current phase that began in 1989 is marked by 5 major streams of
migrants(1993 entries)<p>
--family unification(1.4 million), <p>
--asylum seekers and those seeking temporary protection from wars at
home(630,000), <p>
--the return of "citizens" to their countries of origin, as ethnic Germans to
Germany(242,000), <p>
--illegal immigrants(350,000)<p>
--and temporary workers(300,000).  <p>
The total number of entries peaked at almost three million in 1992, and was
reduced to about 2.6 million, excluding temporary workers, in 1993 by asylum
reforms in Germany and stepped-up efforts to reduce illegal immigration.<p>
<p>
Part II of the report provides country-by-country summaries of immigration
patterns since WWII.  Austria was converted from a transit country to a country
of immigration by guestworker recruitment and its attractiveness to asylum
seekers, so that the 700,000 foreigners in the country are nine percent of the
population.  Denmark's foreign population was changed by guestworkers and
asylum seekers from mostly Nordics to include more southern Europeans.  Finland
has traditionally been a country of emigration, but it has since 1990 begun to
receive asylum seekers--almost 4,000 in 1992.  <p>
<p>
Non-immigrant Germany is Europe's major country of immigration.  As in Austria
and Switzerland, guestworkers recruitment laid the basis for subsequent
immigration.  Most of the guestworker recruitment was concentrated in the four
years between 1968 and 1972, when the number of guestworkers rose from 1 to 2.6
million, and their share of the labor force rose from 5 to 12 percent.  German
efforts to reduce immigration were only short-lived successes, and its generous
asylum policy produced an estimated one million entrants to the former West
Germany in 1990.  Germany has revised its asylum policies, and offered
temporary worker opportunities to especially Eastern Europeans.<p>
<p>
France is Europe's traditional country of immigration, giving France one of the
easiest paths to naturalization.  France recruited guestworkers in the 1960s,
but under programs that were relatively inefficient, so that illegal arrival
and subsequent regularization of status became the norm.  This toleration of
illegal immigrants has produced in France several amnesties that were coupled
with tougher enforcement of immigration laws.  France in November 1993
toughened its asylum and immigration policies to make it easier to remove
failed asylum seekers and to make immigration more difficult.<p>
<p>
The same themes run through the other country studies.  In most, immigration
ratcheted upward despite policies designed to stabilize or reduce the foreign
population, and the frustration prompted sometimes significant changes in
immigration and asylum polices.  <p>
<p>
Perhaps the most useful part of the book is its sketch of the possibilities for
international cooperation to regulate immigration.  Immigration is probably the
most important international phenomenon that is not being coordinated by a an
international organization.  Imagine the confusion if trade in goods were dealt
with as are immigration flows--there would be no common definition or data, no
agreement on the costs and benefits of policy choices, and no organization to
enforce the rules laid down for nation-states. <p>
<p>
The report ends on the reminder that doing nothing is not a solution--the
problems of managing migration are likely to get more rather than less severe
over time.  European experience shows that, over the past 50 years, it has been
the form of immigration, but not the fact of immigration, that has changed in
response to government policies.  As countries change from active selection of
newcomers to coping with those who arrive, costs and frustration
mount--processing and caring for asylum seekers in 1993 cost $11 to $12
billion.<p>
<p>
Immigration is a major international challenge at the dawn of the 21st century,
as it was at the beginning of the 20th century.  The 20th century experience of
integrating European immigrants is today regarded as one of the major
achievements of North America.  Reports like this one can help European leaders
to ensure that their efforts to manage migration will be viewed favorably 100
years from now.<p>
<p>
The European Institute organized a December 12 discussion of European-American
immigration experiences, and Widgren there emphasized that there is in Europe
today a (false) sense that immigration has been dealt with successfully.  The
number of asylum seekers is down, East-West migration has been channeled
largely into temporary worker, ethnic citizen, and petty trader outlets, and
the threat of anti-immigrant political parties seems to have faded.  But
significant problems remain.  There could yet be a wave of refugees from
Eastern Europe and the ex-USSR, and the tensions between freedom of movement
and border controls within the EU could prove to be very divisive.<p>
  <p>
The facts speak for themselves.  The richest 15 percent of the world's
population--the 828 million residents of what the World Bank calls the 22
high-income countries--accounted for almost 80 percent of the world's $23
trillion GDP in 1992.  Their share of the world's population is shrinking,
while their share of world GDP has risen since 1970.  The result are huge gaps
in wages and incomes--an average person's income can be 10 or 20 or 40 times
larger in one of the high income country.  The result, not surprisingly, is
migration pressures, as the three revolutions of the past
generation--communications, transportation, and rights--make it easier to learn
that the grass is greener abroad, get to another country, and then stay
there.<p>
<p>
There was general agreement that managing mass migrations would be a major
challenge to governments in the 1990s and beyond, but little sense of where
policy makers should jump into the migration issue.  Some stressed the need to
prevent mass refugee movements by preventing war.  Others suggested that
immigration countries might look at their own policies to see what magnets are
attracting refugees.  Some stressed the need to deal with alien smugglers who
are profiting handsomely by taking advantage of differences of 10 or 20 to one
in wages, while others thought it more important to learn how to deal better
with immigration emergencies, as occur when Albanians set out for Italy or
Haitians and Cubans for the US.  Finally, some want to attack the root causes
of migration, which might imply much more aid and trade with emigration
countries and, at least in the short run, more emigration from them.<p>
<p>
In the search for transatlantic solutions to the common problem of managing
migration, it was noted that there is a fundamental difference between dealing
with goods and people.  People crossing borders are far more complex than even
the most sophisticated computer that is traded, but there is also another
difference--there is agreement that trade in goods should be as free as
possible, and estimates of the benefits of freer trade.  Europe and North
America do not yet have common migration goals, and there is no consensus on
the benefits and costs or open and closed borders.  <p>
<p>
Perhaps the fundamental problem is that people are ever changing, so that there
are few timeless principles in managing migration.   <p>

Roger Waldinger will direct a summer 1995 seminar for college teachers at UCLA
on "Contemporary Immigration to the United States."  This seminar will consider
recent immigration to the United States in light of the old, searching both for
the similarities that link this latest wave to the turn-of-the-century
experience, and for the differences that make post-1965 immigration
distinctive. <p>
