Over the past several years, thirty-
seven states have passed legislation
allowing medical patients to receive 
marijuana. Iowa's version was signed 
into law by the Governor of Iowa on 
June 1, 1979, after passing in the 
Iowa Senate by 46 to 0, and in the 
Iowa House by 68 to 26. In March of 
1992, that legislation was 
effectively nullified when the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the 
only legal source of marijuana in the 
United States, decided to stop the 
supply.  Remedial legislation is 
necessary.

QUESTION: Will you lend your support 
in demanding that the Federal 
Government allow Iowans with 
legitimate medical needs to use 
marijuana for medical purposes?

Yes

No

Not sure
