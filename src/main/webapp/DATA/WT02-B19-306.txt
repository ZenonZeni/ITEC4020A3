House Issues Discussion Draft of IDEA Reauthorization<P>
<BR>
Reston, Aug. 1, 1995 -- The House Committee on Economic and Educational<BR>
Opportunities is circulating a "staff discussion draft," which is dated July 27. <BR>
According to House staffers, they plan to mark up this bill sometime in<BR>
September, after the August recess.  The draft only discusses recommendations<BR>
for Parts A (Administrative), B (State grants), and C (Infants and toddlers,<BR>
formerly Part H).  Following is a brief summary of the draft's summary:<P>
Categorization/Eligibility:  The House wants to allow a more flexible approach<BR>
to providing special education and related services for young children.  They<BR>
have adopted CEC's recommendation to allow states to extend use of<BR>
"developmental delay" definition for children up to age 9.<P>
Funding formula:  The House proposes to phase out the "head count" formula,<BR>
and ease in a population-based formula over the next 10 years.<P>
LRE:  States will be required to have "placement neutral" funding formulas.<P>
Discipline/Stay-put:  Student's IEP will include behavior management<BR>
techniques; allow hearing officer to remove a potentially dangerous student and<BR>
place in an alternative placement for up to 45 days (same as Dept. of Ed's bill);<BR>
allow removal from classroom for 45 days for students that engage in violent<BR>
acts or bring weapons to school (same as ED bill and CEC's recommendations).<P>
PLUS:  If action is not disability-related, any school discipline policy applied to<BR>
non-disabled students may be equally applied to the disabled students.  CEC is<BR>
opposed to this, and believes that even if a child with a disability is expelled,<BR>
the school must still provide a FAPE in the LRE possible.<P>
Mediation:  States must provide voluntary mediation to parents. CEC made this<BR>
recommendation also.<P>
Attorneys' fees:  maintain current law on attorneys' fees allowance for parents<BR>
that prevail; allow judge to withhold attorneys' fees if parents do not give<BR>
schools 10-day advance writen notice of their concerns before filing complaint;<BR>
when multiple issues are in dispute, allow judge to award attorneys' fees only<BR>
for issues in which parents prevailed.<P>
Policy Letters vs. Regulations:  Certain policy interpretations with broad<BR>
applicability should be subject to public comment and review.<P>
Part C (formerly Part H):  continue current law policy allowing states to serve<BR>
at-risk children, but do not create any new requirements relating to at-risk (CEC<BR>
agrees with this).<P>
The House is asking for comments by Thursday, August 3; additional comments<BR>
will be accepted until August 28.  They should be addressed to the attention of<BR>
Deanna Waldron, Room 2181 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington,<BR>
DC  20515.<BR>
