<h2><a name="m&a">MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</a></h2>
<h4>Taking account of HR issues</h4>

<p>Cross-border merger and acquisition activity is as hot as ever. In spite of its strategic advantages, 
such activity can sometimes produce unpleasant surprises and disappointing results. HR issues provide 
a good example of what can go wrong. Here are some approaches that companies can take to maximise 
the potential opportunities and minimise the potential pitfalls. 

<p>Any acquisition has two phases: before the transaction and after. This article concentrates on the first 
phase; the second will be the subject of the leader in the next issue of Headlines in August. 

<p>Before the transaction is completed, a typical flow of events in a non-hostile takeover could be:

<p><ul>
  <li>pre-bid activity
  <li>due diligence review of target company
  <li>negotiation of price and approach 
  <li>contract wording. 
</ul>

<p>HR professionals have a role to play during each of these stages. 

<p><b>Pre-bid activity.</b> The HR department should be consulted to help assess the impact of HR 
issues as part of deciding whether to pursue the target. It should, for example, consider the likely costs of 
any redundancy programmes, and build appropriate employment costs into any financial modelling of the 
target business. 

<p><b>Due diligence review.</b> Some of the key items for review are:

<p><ul>
  <li>employee benefit plans: The buyer should ensure that sufficient funds or reserves exist to 
discharge any likely liability.
  <li>promises and acquired rights: The buyer should bear in mind that not all long-term commitments 
are in the form of written plans.
  <li>level and structure of compensation: The buyer must analyse how the target company’s 
compensation levels compare with those of its competitors and how well the structure will integrate 
with the buyer’s system.
  <li>staff skills, and development and training: The buyer will need to determine whether the 
appropriate skills and competencies exist to carry out the post-acquisition business plan.
  <li>employment terms for key executives: The buyer should establish whether key executives have 
employment contracts and whether they will require guaranteed severance arrangements or 
supplementary retention devices (such as restricted stock grants) to remain in the new organisation.
  <li>collective bargaining agreements: The buyer needs to be aware of any agreements that oblige it 
to agree to employment conditions set on an industry basis.
</ul>

<p><b>Negotiation of price and approach.</b> If the due diligence review uncovers significant HR 
issues, the buyer can proceed in one of three ways:

<p><ul>
  <li>quantify the potential financial impact and adjust the bid price accordingly
  <li>do not adjust the bid price but agree with the seller a framework for quantifying the cost impact 
and settling the issues financially after the deal closes
  <li>ignore the information or use some of the details in negotiation. 
</ul>

<p>The specific circumstances of the deal will dictate which approach makes most sense. However, the 
second approach usually provides the best protection.

<p><b>Contract wording.</b> The section of the purchase agreement that deals with HR issues can 
fulfil at least three purposes:

<p><ul>
  <li>It can provide a sequence of actions to be taken between parties after closure. 
  <li>It can provide protection — in the form of warrants that all relevant facts have been disclosed — 
from unpleasant surprises. 
  <li>It can specify exactly how the accrued liabilities under benefit plans will be treated and how any 
monetary adjustment will be calculated and remitted after the closing. 
</ul>

<p>The purchase agreement can even specify procedures — including an arbitration procedure — to be 
followed to resolve issues still outstanding when the agreement is signed.

<h2><a name="br">BRAZIL</a></h2>
<h4>Benefit trends highlighted</h4>

<p>The Towers Perrin 1995 survey of corporate benefit trends in Brazil reveals that companies are 
continuing to provide a wide range of benefits to their employees, in spite of difficult political and 
economic conditions. The survey was conducted among 261 companies operating in all sectors of the 
economy. Its main objectives were to:

<p><ul>
  <li>identify the most commonly provided benefits
  <li>collate information about coverage, eligibility and financing. 
</ul>

<p>The benefits most commonly provided by Brazilian employers are medical care, meal allowances 
and group life insurance, with more than 90% of participating companies providing all of these benefits. 
The full pattern of corporate benefit provision is shown in the chart below. 

<p>The percentage of companies providing a pension plan has increased to 52% in 1995 from 20% in 
1985. More than half (53%) of these plans are either defined contribution or hybrid, reflecting employers’ 
wish to control costs and minimise risk.

<h2><a name="ie">IRELAND</a></h2>
<h4>Pensions (Amendment) Bill progresses</h4>

<p>Employers with pension schemes in Ireland should monitor the progress of the bill that is currently 
going through its second reading in Parliament. It introduces a ‘whistle blowing’ provision, strengthens 
the powers of the Pensions Board and improves the position of trustees. 

<p><b>Whistle blowing.</b> The bill introduces a requirement to blow the whistle on any potential 
fraud or misappropriation. Failure to do so will be an offence punishable by a maximum fine of IR£1,500 
on a summary conviction or one year’s imprisonment or both. Those with a duty to blow the whistle 
include trustees, anybody to whom the trustees have delegated a duty, actuaries, insurance companies 
and investment managers, and those who prepare schemes’ annual reports. 

<p><b>Pensions Board.</b> The board will have greater powers to:

<p><ul>
  <li>investigate and intervene 
  <li>remove and replace trustees
  <li>give guidance on the operations of the Pensions Act
  <li>apply for court orders concerning wrongful payments or transfers of assets, unsuitable 
investments and arrears of contributions. 
</ul>

<p><b>Trustees.</b> The bill significantly improves the position of trustees by:

<p><ul>
  <li>removing the anomaly that a trustee could be found guilty of an offence, even though the problem 
was caused by the failure of a third party 
  <li>allowing them to charge the costs of ‘appropriate training’ to the scheme 
  <li>giving them direct representation on the Pensions Board by requiring that at least one member of 
the board be a trustee. 
</ul>

<h2><a name="nz">NEW ZEALAND</a></h2>
<h4>New tax rates discourage pension scheme investment</h4>

<p>A major issue facing trustees and company scheme sponsors is the taxation basis for schemes. 
Currently, the lower paid (and those earning the National Average Wage) suffer a small tax penalty by 
virtue of the tax at 33 cents in the dollar levied on a scheme’s investment income and on the employer’s 
contribution. 

<p>From 1 July 1996, the marginal tax rate for members earning between NZ$9,500 and NZ$34,200 will 
decrease from 28% to 24%, making a difference of 9% in the rate for the scheme and the member. From 
1 July 1997, the difference will increase to 12%. 

<p>If no changes are made to the new tax basis, then companies should start to consider alternative 
products such as unit trusts, which are taxed more favourably for the average New Zealand worker.

<h4><a name="nz2">Disclosure legislation stalls</a></h4>

<p>The Investment and Advisor Product (Disclosure) Bill (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a 
href="9602.html#nz">February</a> 1996) is still in its committee stages. The bill incorporates major 
changes to the disclosure requirements by corporate superannuation schemes to their members. It is 
currently not clear when the committee will report back to Parliament and whether or not changes will be 
made to take account of the legitimate concerns of corporate schemes.

<h2><a name="za">SOUTH AFRICA</a></h2>
<h4>Foreign investment through asset swaps permitted</h4>

<p>Local institutions, including retirement benefit plans, can now swap a portion of their local assets for 
foreign holdings. Plans considering asset swaps will need to carefully review the costs associated with 
the transaction as well as the mechanics of the swap and the management of the offshore assets. The 
move to allow swaps is part of the process of liberalising South Africa’s foreign exchange that began in 
March 1995. 

<p>The Reserve Bank has specified a number of parameters within which each swap has to operate. 
The critical constraint is that South African foreign exchange reserves must remain unaffected. This is 
achieved by matching the outflow with an equivalent inflow from a foreign investor. At this stage, only 
physical asset swaps are permitted (excluding derivatives), although there is some flexibility regarding 
the nature of assets to be transferred. The limit was initially set at 2.5% of total plan assets; however, on 
application, permission will be granted for up to 5%. 

<p>Asset swaps have clear benefits for the South African parties, including diversification, potential for 
higher returns, exposure to different economies, and protection against the volatile currency. The small 
percentage of assets remains a significant constraint. The attraction for foreign investors is less clear. 
They are free to participate directly in the market and would need some enticement in order to engage in 
the additional complications of an asset swap. Where discounts are available, these are typically less 
than 1.5% and may be linked to a lock-in period. There may be some liquidity advantage, as well as a 
marketing advantage, in terms of establishing a name and obtaining South African money to manage 
offshore.

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>Changes to tax treatment of stock options proposed</h4>

<p>Companies that operate stock option programmes in Sweden will need to monitor future 
developments following a report by the National Tax Board in which it proposes a change in the tax 
treatment of such options. 

<p>The options give employees the right to purchase shares in the future, often at a rate determined at 
the time of grant. The Supreme Administrative Court had previously ruled that taxation is not applicable 
at the time of grant of stock options. Income tax is currently levied when employees have the right to 
exercise the grant, regardless of whether they do so or not. 

<p>However, the National Tax Board has now decided that a tax liability does occur at the time of grant, 
according to ‘market conditions’. This liability will be determined by calculating an ‘expected future 
value’, using assumptions based on the Black- Scholes method. The tax authority in Stockholm has 
already indicated that the ‘expected value’ will be subject to tax after 1 January 1996. It is not yet clear 
how the ‘expected future value’ will be assessed by local tax authorities.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Long-term care proposals issued</h4>

<p>The government has issued a consultation paper on the provision of care for the elderly in the UK. 
The issue is important because the costs of long-term care can be substantial; as the population ages 
and life expectancy increases, it is likely that many individuals will need some form of care during their 
lifetime. 

<p>The purpose of the paper is to establish a framework for partnership between the state, individuals, 
their families and financial institutions to reduce the financial impact of long-term care. The main 
principle behind the proposals is that individuals who take steps to protect themselves against the costs 
of long-term care by, for example, buying insurance will be able to enjoy additional allowances when 
applying for state benefits. At present, individuals who have more than £16,000 of assets must fund the 
entire cost of care from their own assets and only individuals with less than £10,000 in assets have all 
the cost of their care needs met by the state. 

<p>Proposals set out in the consultation document would allow an individual who purchased insurance to 
increase the £16,000 limit. The higher the level of insurance purchased, the more assets that would be 
protected when applying for state benefits. These proposals are similar to schemes operated in some 
parts of the United States, such as California, Connecticut, Indiana and New York.

<h4><a name="uk2">Executive remuneration consultation paper issued</a></h4>

<p>A key recommendation of the Greenbury Committee’s report on remuneration for directors of UK 
listed companies (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9508.html#uk">August</a> 1995) was that the value 
of a director’s pension entitlements earned during the year should be disclosed. The committee asked 
for, and the UK actuarial profession prepared, a recommended method of calculation. However, once 
these proposals had been analysed, several commentators believed that the proposals were difficult to 
explain, likely to be misinterpreted and unacceptably volatile. 

<p>This led the Stock Exchange to ask the actuarial profession to broaden the scope of its review and 
present a consultation paper. The results of this consultation exercise, together with the UK actuarial 
profession’s recommendations, were published on 30 April 1996 and, although the consultation process 
produced no clear consensus, the report recommends that companies disclose both:

<p><ul>
  <li>the increase in the amount of accrued pension during the year
  <li>the capital value of the increase in pension or sufficient information such that an outside party 
could place a value on the increase in pension. 
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that the capital value be calculated using the pension scheme’s normal basis for 
calculating transfer values or its equivalent. The above applies only to defined benefit arrangements. For 
defined contribution (money purchase) arrangements, it is the contribution credited to the director that 
should be disclosed. 

<p>The next stage of the process will be for the Stock Exchange to prepare an appropriate listing rule 
that incorporates these recommendations; this will then be the subject of further consultation.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>High Court ruling raises new concerns for employers</h4>

<p>A recent decision by the US Supreme Court suggests that employers need to be more careful than 
ever about how they communicate their business plans to employees when those plans could have an 
impact on employee benefits. The ruling is particularly applicable to situations in which employee 
benefits stand to be affected by a significant business restructuring, such as a spinoff or divestiture. 

<p>In the case decided by the Supreme Court, an employer had organised a new subsidiary that 
consisted of several existing divisions. When the new subsidiary failed and its retiree medical 
programme was cancelled, the subsidiary’s employees sued the parent company, seeking restoration of 
their former retiree medical benefits. Among several issues litigated all the way to the Supreme Court 
was the question of whether the company was acting as plan administrator — rather than as employer — 
in its pre-spinoff communications with employees and, thus, whether a fiduciary standard should be 
applied to its conduct. 

<p>Employers who serve as plan administrators of their ERISA-covered benefit plans — as many do — 
often find themselves wearing two hats. In deciding whether to sponsor or terminate a benefit plan, 
employers make business judgments that are generally not subject to ERISA fiduciary standards. Once a 
plan is adopted, however, the same employer may also serve as plan administrator, a role subject to a 
fiduciary standard of conduct in which the employer must act solely in the interest of participants and 
beneficiaries. Knowing when an employer is wearing which hat has been a grey area in the law and a 
continuing challenge for employers. 

<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court concluded that the employer spoke as a plan administrator in this 
case when it conveyed the basic message to employees that transferring to the new subsidiary would not 
significantly undermine the security of their benefits. Thus, the High Court upheld the trial court’s ruling 
that the employer should provide ‘equitable relief’ — including in this case restoration of the benefits — 
to the employees. The ruling (Varity v Howe) not only is likely to fuel more litigation by employees and 
retirees whose benefits are reduced following a restructuring, it also makes it clear that employer 
communications will be scrutinised carefully and could be held to a very high standard of care in such 
cases.

<h4><a name="us2">Workers compensation cost growth slows</a></h4>

<p>As recently as 1993, the cost of workers compensation programmes — state-mandated medical and 
income-replacement benefits for workers who suffer work-related injuries and illnesses — was rising 
rapidly for many, if not most, employers. By last year, however, only half of the 686 employers 
participating in Tillinghast – Towers Perrin’s third biennial survey of workers compensation costs saw 
those costs as a threat to their bottom line. 

<p>Indeed, 41% of the respondents in our 1995 survey reported that their workers compensation costs 
actually declined over the last two years, while only 30% reported cost increases over the period. 
However, despite the favourable trends many companies are seeing, the survey shows that direct 
workers compensation expenses remain a significant cost of doing business in many parts of the country 
— averaging 2.09% of payroll for the 1995 survey participants (down from 2.16% in 1992). 

<p>The survey responses confirm that most employers have implemented a broad array of workers 
compensation cost management initiatives in recent years, such as safety initiatives/injury prevention 
programmes and case management approaches (both used by 88% of the respondents). The responses 
also reveal an opportunity for using more focused performance measurement as a tool to better 
understand which initiatives are most effective and, thus, further improve programme performance and 
results. For example, most survey respondents now collect a fair amount of data on injuries and 
illnesses, but relatively few use that data to measure the effectiveness of their programmes and ensure 
continuous improvement in their internal performance and that of their workers compensation vendors.
