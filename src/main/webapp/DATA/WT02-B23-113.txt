<p> The MMAE Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology 
offers the Bachelor of Science degrees in Mechanical 
Engineering (B.S.M.E.), Metallurgical and Materials Engineering 
(B.S.M.M.E.), and Aerospace Engineering (B.S.A.E.). These 
degree programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation 
Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and 
Technology (ABET). All three programs build upon a strong 
foundation in mathematics and basic sciences, the humanities 
and social sciences, and a balance of engineering topics in the 
respective disciplines; include innovative engineering 
activities and opportunities for undergraduate students; and 
are responsive to the changing needs of industry. The aim is to 
educate individuals for professional careers in engineering and 
to provide the basis for life-long learning and advanced study 
at the graduate level.</p>


<p>In recognition of the changing professional environment in 
which IIT’s graduates will function, the MMAE Department 
programs place substantial emphasis on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching students to understand the economic, ethical, 
societal, environmental and international context of their professional activities,</li> 
<li>improving oral and written
communication skills,</li>
 <li>training students to work in 
multidisciplinary teams,</li>
<li>  preparing students for the 
interprofessional work force of the 21st century,</li>
<li> enhancing 
students’ abilities to link science and engineering principles 
to key technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are introduced to the scope of 
the engineering profession in the first year courses 
Introduction to the Professions I and II, and to the ethical, 
economical, safety, environmental and other responsibilities of 
being a professional engineer. Strong emphasis is placed on 
development of oral and written communication skills. 
Accompanying courses in mathematics and the basic sciences 
provide the foundation for later studies of engineering 
sciences relevant to the students’ major fields of study. These 
areas include: energy and structures for the ME major; 
materials, processes and their selection, and plant design for 
the MME major; and structures and materials, propulsion and 
aerodynamics for the AE major.</p>
<p> The second year emphasizes 
building a foundation for the eventual study of engineering 
design. The engineering sciences offer a rational approach to 
solving detailed problems encountered in major-specific 
courses, including the capstone design courses, of the third 
and fourth years. The student’s professional experience is 
developed by participation in interprofessional projects in the 
second, third and fourth years.</p>
<p> In the third year, students 
begin the transition to professional practice and learn to 
develop sound engineering judgment by studying open ended 
problems and realistic constraints. Students build further on 
the engineering sciences and approximately one-third of 
major-specific course work is devoted to the introduction of 
tangible engineering design.</p> 
<p>The process continues into the 
fourth year where the metallurgical and materials program 
culminates in one and the mechanical and aerospace engineering 
programs culminate in two senior year capstone design courses. 
Mechanical engineering projects involve design of thermal and 
mechanical systems, metallurgical and materials engineering 
students develop new or optimized materials, processing routes 
and selection schemes, and aerospace engineering students 
produce conceptual designs of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>
