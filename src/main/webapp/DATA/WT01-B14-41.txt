<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>





The growth of the mutual fund industry has had several effects on the economy.

<P>

First, it has encouraged the household sector to boost its equity market exposure to the highest level since the 1960's.  Household ownership of equities and mutual funds now exceeds 25% of all households financial assets compared to 15.5% in 1995, 13.5% in 1975, and a previous peak of 36.0% in 1968.  Mutual funds now also represent about 25% of total household equity portfolios compared to 14% in 1985, 6% in 1968 and less than 4% in the 1960's.

<P>

Second, the growth of the mutual fund industry is broadening the number of households with exposure to the equity market.  According to data from Federal Reserve surveys of household finances, about 17.8% of U.S. households owned equities directly in 1992 compared to 19.l1% in 1983 and 17.2% in 1962.  But if we include mutual funds, the share of households owning equities rises to 22.0% from 20.1% in 1983 and 19.0% in 1962.  If we include IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans, the share rises to 37.4% from 33.2% in 1983.  There is no comparable data for the 1960's because IRA's and defined contribution pension plans were non-existent before the 1970's. 

<P>

While the share of the population owning equities has been expanding steadily during recent years, the great bulk of U.S. equity continues to be owned by high income people.  According to the Federal Reserve survey of household finances, people with incomes above $250,000 (1.2% of total households) own 29.11% of all publicly traded stock compared to 20.78% for the income group earning $100,000-250,000  (5.9% of total households), 8.76% for the income group earning $75,000-100,000 (5.51% of total households) and 15.16% for the income group earning $50,000-75,000 (13.38% of total households).

<P>

If we divide the population on the basis of wealth, the ownership of equity appears to be even more concentrated.  According to the Fed surveys, the wealthiest 0.5% of  U.S.  households own 58.6% of all publicly traded stock compared to 11.74% for the second 0.5%, 24.18% for the next 4% of households, 4.62% for the next 5% and less than 1.0% for the remainder of the population.  In the case of housing equity, by contrast, the bottom 80% of the population owns 28% of residential housing stock compared to just under 16.0% for the top 1.0% of the population.
Age also plays an important role in equity ownership.  In the 1992 Fed survey, households with ages above 65 owned 41.36% of all publicly of traded stock compared to 19.25% for the age group 55-64 years, 18.07% for the age group 45-54 years, and 17.01% for the age group 35-44 years.

<P>

But while U.S. equity ownership is highly concentrated among older high income people, it is becoming more diffuse. The share of publicly traded equity owned by people with incomes above $250,000 fell from 50.60% in 1983 to 29.11% in 1992.  If we broaden the measure of equity ownership to include mutual funds, IRA's, Keoghs and defined contribution plans, the share of the top income group drops from 43.06% in 1983 to 22.72% in 1992.  The major gainers are groups with incomes below $100,000.  The group with incomes of $75,000-100,00 per annum has expanded its share of all equities including mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh's defined contribution pension, to 12.1% from 7.28% in 1983.  The $50,000-75,000 group has boosted its share from 12.63% in 1983 to 16.75% in 1992.  The group earning $25,000-50,000 has boosted its share of  equity from 8.08% in 1983 to 18.39% in 1992.  The group earning under $25,000 has boosted its share from 3.06% in 1983 to 7.07% in 1992.

<P>

Stock ownership is also becoming less concentrated on the basis of age, not just income.  In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.35% of U.S. publicly traded equity compared to 49.24% in 1983.  The age group 35-44 years, by contrast, has increased its share of  publicly traded equity from 6.83% in 1983 to 17.01% in 1992.  Share ownership is also far more diffused when mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans are included.  On this basis, the share of equity owned by households over 65 years of age falls from 43.14% in 1983 to 30.71% in 1992 while the share of households aged 35-44 years rises from 9.13% to 16.97%.

<P>

Equity ownership on the basis of wealth continues to be highly concentrated but it is becoming gradually more diffuse.  In 1992, the top 1.0% of households owned over 70% of publicly traded U.S. equity compared to 78% in 1983 and 75.07% in 1962.  The next 4% of the population owned 24.18% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 17.38% in 1983 and 20.4% in 1962.  The next 5% of the population owned 4.62% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 3.58% in 1983 and 3.77% in 1962.  The bottom 80% of the population continues to own an insignificant share of publicly traded stock compared to 13.7% of all non-equity financial assets, 28.07% of the national housing stock and 19.2% of total household net worth. What has changed dramatically as a result of the mutual fund boom is the distribution of bond ownership by wealth class.  In 1992, the wealthiest 1.0% of the U.S. population owned 41.6% of all bonds compared to 78% in 1989.  The next 9% of the population has expanded its share of the bond market from 16.1% to 46.3% while the other 90% of the population has boosted its share from 5.9% to 12.0%.

<P>

Thirdly, the growth of the mutual fund sector is altering the ownership structure of the U.S. corporate sector.  In 1994, mutual funds owned 13.6% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 7.1% in 1990, 5.0% in 1985 and 4.5-5.5% during the 1960's.  During the modern era, the dominant trend in equity ownership has been a steady decline in the household share and a steady increase in the pension fund share.  In 1951, households owned 90% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 1.1% for pension funds, 3.1% for mutual funds, 3.5% for insurance companies, and 2.2% for foreign investors.  The household share remained high through the 1950's but plunged to 55.0-60.0% by the early 1970's while the pension fund share grew to 15.0-16.0% and bank personal trusts expanded to 11.0-12.0%.  The household share of corporate equity continued to erode during the 1980's and is now only 47.7%.  The bank trust account share also has slid to 2.7% while the pension fund share has been stable in the 24-26% range since the mid-1980's.  The growth of defined contribution pension plans, individual retirement accounts, and 401-K plans will probably continue to boost the mutual fund share of U.S. corporate equity during the late 1990's at the expense of direct household ownership.  But since households own two thirds of mutual fund assets as well as most trust fund and defined benefit pension plans asssets, analysts estimate that households still control about two thirds of all U.S. corporate equity on a direct and indirect basis.

<P>

Fourthly, the growth of mutual fund assets has helped to encourage a tremendous boom in securitized finance by companies. The number of initial equity public offerings has risen to record high levels during recent years partly because of the demand for new securities from the mutual fund sector.  The number of equity IPO's was 582 in 1995, 646 in 1994, 471 in 1993, 447 in 1992, 330 in 1991 and only 150 in 1990.  These IPO's raised about $34 billion of new capital for companies in 1995, $30 billion in 1994, $25 billion in 1993, $19.4 billion in 1992, and $13.8 billion in 1991 compared to only $4.2 billion in 1990.  The search for higher yields also revitalized the so-called "junk bond market".  In 1993, Wall Street sold about $60 billion of non-investment grade bonds compared to $42 billion in 1992, $16.9 billion in 1991, and $2.9 billion in 1990.

<P>

The improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium sized companies is important to job creation because practically all of America's employment growth since 1980 has been concentrated in that sector.  Between 1979 and 1994, the Fortune 500 companies reduced their employment from 16.2 million to 11.8 million.  In the 1980's, the employment losses at large firms were offset by job creation at small firms, but during the early 1990's the economy stalled in part because the small firms lost access to the credit market.  In 1993, by contrast, the mutual fund boom provided small firms with unprecedented access to the debt and equity markets while the recovery in bank profitability encouraged banks to ease their lending conditions as well.  The securitization boom has even had a benign effect on the U.S. real estate market.    During 1992 and 1993, Wall Street sold retail investors about 100 new Real Estate investment Trusts worth $12 billion.  These trusts permit investors to invest in real estate without being subject to double taxation of income.  They became popular as interest rates fell because commercial property still offered yields in the 10-12% range.  As a result of the IPO boomlet for real estate, the market capitalization of the REIT sector now exceeds $60 billion compared to less than $10 billion during 1990.

<P>

Fifth, the growth of the mutual fund industry is helping to encourage an unprecedented outflow of capital from the U.S. to foreign security markets.  The number of purely international equity funds has expanded from 13 in 1984 to 367 while the number of global equity funds (including U.S.) has grown from 16 to 176.  Meanwhile, the population of global bond funds has shot up from 1 in 1985 to 145 today.  International and global equity funds have expanded their assets from $37 billion in 1992 to $212 billion recently while global bond funds grew from $27.6 billion to a peak of $40 billion in early 1994 before rising interest rates caused an upsurge of net redemptions which reduced assets to $33 billion in late 1995.  The creation of this new infrastructure for retail diversification into foreign securities has made New York a far larger market for international bonds and equities than it has ever been before.  But the retail demand for foreign securities is volatile.  The share of money flows into international mutual funds peaked at 44% in early 1994 and then slumped to less than 20% during much of 1995 as Wall Street boomed.  The assets of international money market funds have slumped from a peak of $21.4 billion during the period of high European interest rates after German unification to only $3.7 billion recently.  In January, 1996, money flows into international and global equity funds shot up to over $6 billion from only $1-2 billion in mid-1995 but their share of total equity sales was still only 25%.

<P>

Finally, the mutual fund boom is forcing banks to introduce new fund products  in order to retain their share of household savings flows.  In 1994, 2072 banks sold mutual funds and 46% of them were proprietary funds compared to 31.5% in 1991.  In the early 1990's, banks primarily offered money market funds but they are also now actively promoting equity and bond funds.  Such products accounted for over 70% of their money flows in 1994 compared to only about one half in 1991.  Government officials are concerned that households may confuse mutual fund products with government insured deposits, so they are encouraging banks to carefully explain to customers that their mutual fund products do not enjoy FDIC protection but surveys indicate that bank customers do not always fully understand the distinction.  The growth of bank sponsored mutual funds is also complicating the task of the Federal Reserve in monitoring the growth of the nation's monetary aggregates.  The Fed includes money market funds in its measure of M2 but it does not include any share of bond and equity funds despite the fact that such funds often have check writing privileges.
