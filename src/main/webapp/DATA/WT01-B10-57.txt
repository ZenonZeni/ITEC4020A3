<b>Introduction</b><br>
We recommend that you read these instructions entirely as soon as you can, making notations in the margins about any area where you have questions.  As you approach each step we recommend that you re-read that particular section and ask any questions at that time.  This will prevent you from becoming confused with too many answers at one time.  <p>

The use of donor gametes (sperm  and eggs) has a long history in its application to male infertility.  When the male partner in an infertile couple has azoospermia (no sperm) or severe oligospermia (low sperm number), the only treatment which allows the female partner to conceive is the utilization of donor sperm for artificial insemination.  Artificial insemination with donor sperm is a standard and widely practiced treatment for male infertility.<p>

The use of the female gamete, the egg or oocyte, for treatment of certain disorders leading to female reproductive failure has only been possible since 1984.  The oocyte from a donor can be either recovered as an embryo after it has undergone fertilization within the body (by uterine lavage(washing)  in a process called ovum transfer) or recovered as an egg and inseminated in vitro (in the laboratory) to yield an in vitro fertilized embryo.<p>

Ovum transfer, the transfer of a normally fertilized egg from a female donor  to an infertile recipient, was developed in the United States and also performed in Italy.  It has presently been abandoned in the United States.  The major reasons for its present disfavor are:  1) The fertile donor, having to be inseminated with the recipient's husband's sperm would be at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, the most devastating one without a screening procedure being the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS),  2) if the conceptus created is not recovered by uterine lavage procedure, there is the risk of establishing an intrauterine pregnancy in the donor woman requiring its termination, and most importantly  3) without use of drugs to induce superovulation, the success of ovum transfer per each natural insemination cycle has been less that 10%.  
<p>
The use of in vitro fertilized donor eggs has been more widely applied with births reported in several countries including Australia, England, Israel, and the United States.  There are two major advances in in vitro fertilization technology that have made the use of donor eggs more feasible.  The first advance has been the introduction of ultrasound-guided egg recovery techniques.  Ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte recovery at Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre is performed on an outpatient basis requiring only local  anesthesia and sedation.  Laparoscopy and general anesthesia are not required, making the procedure less risky and its use more justifiable in women for whom there is no direct medical benefit.  The second advance is the success in cryopreservation (freezing) of in vitro fertilized human embryos.  The cryopreservation of embryos makes it unnecessary to have perfect synchronization of the donor and recipient women's menstrual cycles making the logistics of donation much simpler.<p>

It is important to remember that each patient has their own unique response to the medications they receive and that each ART cycle is different.  This means, not only are you unlikely to respond as others do, but you may actually respond differently from one cycle to the next.  For this reason, you will find that your treatment and testing differs from that of other patients.  Please do not compare your test results and medication plans with others to whom you may speak.  Although you may find much in common with other patients here, please keep in mind that IVF/GIFT is a very private matter and that some patients do not feel comfortable discussing this.  <p>

The schedule you find here is to help guide you through your treatment cycle.  Time changes and other adjustments will frequently be made in order to individualize your treatment. <p>

Please keep in mind that all costs are the responsibility of the recipient couple.  The oocyte donor, have no financial responsibility in this process. <p>
<b>Pre-Cycle Counseling</b><br>
Your initial interview at Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre will be with an IVF Nurse Coordinator and will last approximately  90 minutes.  During this time the process of oocyte donation will be explained.  The nurse will gather more detailed information about you and your medical history as well as explore your feelings regarding oocyte donation.  You will also see one of our physicians at this visit and have a physical examination which will include a pelvic ultrasound.  <p>

Following this visit, the information gathered will be reviewed by our IVF team and, when approved, you will be asked to schedule a visit with our psychologist for further testing.  When these tests are completed your file will again be reviewed by the IVF team for acceptance into the program.  You will be notified by mail of the results of this review.<p>

If you are accepted into the program ARHC will match you with a potential oocyte recipient before any further testing occurs.  This process may take several months.  When you have been matched with a recipient couple further testing will begin. The purpose of this screening is to protect the health of the recipient/mother.  This will include blood tests, a Pap Smear, and cervical cultures.  The recipient couple may request genetic testing;  this testing is at the discretion of the recipient couple and is not mandatory by ARHC policy.  Drug testing may also be requested.<p>

We recommend that when your period begins, on the cycle preceding the one you are scheduled to undergo ovulation induction , that you contact the IVF nurse coordinator at (404) 265-3662.  First, you will be asked to review and sign the <a href="donivfpr.html">Egg Donor Permit</a> and the <a href="agree.html">Donor-Recipient Agreement</a>. All consent forms must be signed by you and your husband (if applicable) prior to initiating your treatment cycle. At this time, arrangements will be made to provide you with the necessary  medications, and review and clarify your  obligations. You will have an IVF teaching appointment at which time you will meet with both the doctor and nurse to review these your <a href="ivf2col.html">instructions</a> and have any questions answered.  You are to avoid the possibility  of pregnancy during this cycle by using condoms.<p><hr>
