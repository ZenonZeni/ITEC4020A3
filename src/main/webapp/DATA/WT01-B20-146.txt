Symposium<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>March 2-5, 1995, Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the BIO FACH '95</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
The nova-Institute for Political and Ecological Innovation
in Cologne and the marketing firm TriTec, Bochum, have organized
the first international product and technology exhibition on hemp
as a bioresource, to be held from March 2-5, 1995.in Frankfurt.
The first international scientific-technological symposium on
the subject of hemp will be held concurrently.
<H3>Product and Technology Exhibition</H3>
The aim of the BIORESOURCE HEMP  is to support the realization
of innovative ecological products based on hemp; to bring together
scientists, companies and institutions involved in hemp technology
and hemp product development. Further synergistic effects result
from its proximity to BIO FACH '95, which is the largest trade
fair of ecological consumer goods world-wide. In March 1994, more
than 675 BIO FACH exhibitors displayed their products. At the
same time, the BIO FACH Congress also takes place. There, experts
report on current topics relevant to the eco-industry.<P>
Owing to the proximity to BIO FACH,  the exhibitors of BIORESOURCE
HEMP  have the opportunity to present their new product lines
and innovative technologies to a great number of ecologically
interested visitors. Approximately 30 companies and institutes
from various countries will present their technologies and products
in a projected exhibition area of 1,000 square meters.
<H3>Technological-Scientific Symposium</H3>
A four-day hemp symposium will also be held. Conference languages
are German and English and the admission fee for 4 days is DM
600 (students DM 300). For one day it is DM 250 (students DM 125).
For IHA members, a 20% reduction applies if the registration fee
is paid before February 28.<P>
The symposium will cover the entire spectrum of current international hemp research and technology development. The scientific level of the symposium is intended to allow a realistic assessment of the unquestionably attractive biological resource, hemp.<P>
