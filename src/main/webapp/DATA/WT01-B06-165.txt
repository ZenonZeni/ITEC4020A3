<H1>The Approaching Era of BSE ... Revenge of the Cannibal
Cows</H1>
<P>by Howard Straus, Editor</P>
<HR><P>There have been many cries of apocalyptic doom over
the last decade, from the hole in the ozone to the global
spread of AIDS, the rising cancer rate or global warming.
Many of these have generated controversies, each side of the
controversy having either a palpable agenda, or a vested
economic interest in the status quo. Meanwhile, governments,
in league with agribusiness have been fashioning a real,
present and current disease through cynicism, incompetence,
lies and shortsighted economic expedience. The result could
soon spell an epidemic that would dwarf cancer, heart disease
and AIDS.</P>
<P>In 1981, the British government relaxed agricultural
regulations regarding what could be fed to livestock,
allowing processed slaughterhouse waste to be fed to
livestock as high protein supplements. That meant that
various parts of sheep, chicken and cows, including brains,
eyes and bones, could be processed, flavored and mixed with
other feeds to cheaply increase the productivity of cattle
farms. Brains of sheep with a disease called scrapie were
included in the list of permitted contents of cattle feed, as
were, incredibly, chicken droppings. The fact that this
practice would turn normally vegetarian animals into
carnivores, even cannibals, was simply ignored, despite
warnings from various concerned scientists, and a Royal
Commission, who were roundly ignored and effectively
pooh-poohed. </P>
<P>The practice was widely adopted in the British cattle
industry, and subsequently led to cheaper beef, a highly
desirable result for the growers, and one that enabled the
British to compete well with the Continental beef producers
in France and Holland. </P>
<P>Suddenly, in 1986, the honeymoon ended. The first case of
a new cattle disease had been diagnosed. It was a bovine form
of the sheep disease scrapie, and was called bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE for short. Its better-known
name, by now, is Mad Cow Disease, because the cows that
contract the disease become aggressive, disoriented, and
generally appear to have gone &quot;mad&quot;. The disease
destroys and kills by literally turning the animals' brains
into sponges by boring holes in brain and nerve tissue.
Though the new disease was reported to the appropriate
authorities in the British government, they did nothing to
alert the general population to the situation for at least
eleven months, when they finally published the finding in an
obscure veterinary journal, unlikely to be seen or noticed by
the general public. Certainly, nothing was done to change the
practice of feeding slaughterhouse offal to cows, sheep,
chickens or pigs.</P>
<P>When the press got a hold of the story, and began raising
questions about the safety of British beef, the organs of
government churned into high gear. Every possible senior
official who had anything to do with public opinion, from the
Prime Minister to the Minister of Food and Farming, assuring
the world that British beef was sound, safe, and that this
disease, which had already made the jump from sheep to
cattle, could not possibly make the jump from cattle to
humans. This despite the fact that virtually nothing was
known for certain about BSE. Any researcher or government
official who did not hue to the party line was rapidly and
effectively silenced and/or &quot;made redundant&quot;, i.
e.: fired.</P>
<P>In 1989, two cases of an atypical strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) were diagnosed, a strain
which was alarmingly similar in effect and area of the brain
attacked to BSE. Rare instances of this disease had been
recorded as far back as 1965. Britain's trading partners
began making noises about quarantining British beef, as the
European Economic Community (EEC) had already done to
American beef (antibiotic residues are so high that American
beef is considered &quot;tainted&quot; by the EEC). Still
knowing nothing about the cause of the disease, and having no
&quot;scientific&quot; proof one way or another, the British
government continued its public relations campaign to
convince the world that British beef was sound. How could
they guarantee the health of every cow in the British Isles?
Advertising and governmental gobbledegook would have to do
the trick. The idea that someone might actually have to be
held accountable for an incipient and deadly epidemic was
simply unthinkable. Still, nothing was done to halt the
practice of feeding cows to cows.</P>
<P>The epidemic started to grow. At first, only older people
were affected. Many cases of CJD were probably misdiagnosed,
since the symptoms in humans are very similar to those of
Alzheimer's' Disease. In fact, at least one victim's wife,
convinced that her husband had died of CJD rather than the
diagnosed Alzheimer's, repeatedly demanded an autopsy before
her husband's body was cremated. She was unable to prevent
the cremation, and the autopsy was never done. Another
victim's mother, going public to save other mothers the agony
of watching their own teenagers sicken and die, was told to
think of the economic havoc she was causing. It appeared that
CJD had an incubation period of between ten and twenty years,
and nobody could prove that it was transmitted via cows and
the consumption of animal flesh. Experiments done by the
British government themselves showed that, contrary to the
authorities' statements, monkeys, and by extension, probably
humans were capable of contracting the disease from cattle.
Yet, the spin doctors managed to turn even these experiments
into encouraging news! Not until 1988 were any limits put
onto the amounts, types and health of the offal going into
cattle feed, and then they were inadequate and sloppily
enforced by a government far more responsive (as usual) to
the short-term economic interests of the farmers and commerce
than to the health and survival of its individual citizens.
It was a further two years before controls were put on
feeding infected offal to poultry, whose droppings, remember,
were still being fed to the cattle. Only on March 20, 1996,
after teenagers, some as young as 15 and 16 years old, began
to die of a much faster moving strain of the disease, one
with an incubation time of five to ten years, did the
government finally admit that BSE was the &quot;most
likely&quot; cause of the recent outbreak of CJD, publicly
eating their own words.</P>
<P>On March 26, 1996, the rest of Continental Europe, led by
Germany, put a quarantine on all British beef and beef
products. Russia even embargoed British milk and leather. The
British government has very belatedly instituted a program of
cattle destruction, hoping to limit the damage and restore
confidence in farming practices and the health of the British
cattle herd, numbering in the millions of animals. The
practice of feeding infected offal to the remaining animals
has been discontinued. But the death toll from the new strain
of CJD continues to rise, and the victims are otherwise
healthy teenagers and young adults.</P>
<P>The problems, of course, are very complex. In Iceland,
when the related sheep disease scrapie was found to be
infecting a large proportion of the sheep, every sheep in
Iceland was slaughtered and disposed of, and the entire herd
was replaced by importing healthy animals from abroad. Within
a few years, however, the new herd was infected again. The
only possible means of transmission of the disease from the
sheep that no longer existed to the new, healthy sheep, was
that the ground was infected, and the new sheep could be
infected from the urine and droppings of the old sheep. The
latest understanding of this disease is that it is not
transmitted by a virus or microbe, but by a tiny protein
fraction (called a prion) that is virtually indestructible by
sterilization, acids, heat or burial in soil. This has
chilling implications for the British, who, until recently,
have been burying large numbers of slaughtered, infected cows
and sheep in farms and landfills, many near rivers and
municipal water sources. There is no way to remove these
sources of infection from the ground, as the products of
decay have, by now, spread far and wide, both from urine and
cattle droppings, and from the buried animals. The disease
causes no immune response, and there is no known treatment
for it, much less cure.</P>
<P>Often, when a farmer begins to see the first symptoms of
a BSE-infected animal, economics dictate that he is better
off to kill and bury the animal on his farm than to admit
that his farm is no longer BSE-free, or even better, send the
animal to the slaughterhouse before the animal becomes
clinically ill and has to be destroyed. Although the
government will pay him to destroy and incinerate the
carcass, animals from &quot;BSE-free&quot; farms fetch higher
prices than those from farms admitting the problem.
Unfortunately, this gives farmers large economic incentive to
misrepresent the status of their farms. Some farmers have
already been fined for falsely representing their farms as
BSE-free, others have, most likely, escaped detection.</P>
<P>By May, 1990, a quarter of the population of Great
Britain refused to eat beef. In six months, beef prices
dropped 10-25%, devastating the cattle industry. Cats and zoo
animals are now dying regularly from their own variants of
spongiform encephalopathy; over 160,000 British cattle have
already succumbed to it. To date, there is still no
well-defined, strictly implemented program for keeping
infected offal from infecting healthy meat in Great
Britain.</P>
<P>That's England, though, isn't it?</P>
<P>&quot;What does this have to do with the United
States?&quot; you may be asking. &quot;We have been assured
that there is no BSE problem here. We don't import British
beef, do we?&quot; Well, no, we don't, and haven't since
1989. But what we do continue here is the practice, now
banned in Great Britain, of feeding processed slaughterhouse
waste to cows, chickens and pigs as low cost, high-protein
feed supplementation. This is the very practice that got the
British cattle industry in such bad trouble so very quickly a
decade and a half ago: feeding cows to cows. In 1991, the
USDA considered a mandatory ban on the practice. But
according to an internal USDA document, the agency dismissed
the ban because, &quot;the cost to the livestock and
rendering industries would be substantial.&quot; (Sound like
Britain's initial response?) </P>
<P>We certainly have the problem of scrapie in America, and
it is known to have jumped the species barrier from sheep to
the cattle herd. Scrapie manifests itself in cattle as the
animal falling down, and being unable to rise again. There is
the possibility, even the likelihood of an outbreak of BSE
and its associated human form, CJD occurring in the United
States. It may already have arrived here, and been missed in
the background noise of the enormous human tragedy of our
epidemic of Alzheimer's disease. It is quite possible that
many cases of CJD have been misdiagnosed here as Alzheimer's,
disguising the onset of the epidemic by not recognizing it
for what it is, and giving us a false sense of security. In
fact, there is good evidence that BSE has been in the United
States since the mid-'70s.</P>
<P>What is even worse is that it is not just beef that is
affected. By now, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and food
preparation workers have died of CJD, possibly from the
constant contact with animal blood and offal. The ground on
which the cattle have been urinating and defecating is
certainly infected, and we know that the vector survives in
the ground for long periods of time. We know little about the
effects of the disease or its vectors on other animals fed
infected offal, such as chickens and pigs. And we must assume
that milk and other animal products, like gelatin and dairy
products, and anything that contains them, are possibly
infectious. Think about that, for a moment. Substitute the
more familiar but less likely disease &quot;AIDS&quot;, and
imagine being at risk for infection from a milk chocolate bar
or a cold remedy in a gelatin capsule, the egg, butter or
milk in a piece of birthday cake, a cup of nonfat yogurt or
cottage cheese, and you will begin to understand how deeply
the malpractice of the food-animal industry has endangered
your life and the lives of your family. </P>
<P>&quot;The critical uncertainty,&quot; to quote an article
from the Internet by Michael Greger, &quot;is, how small a
dose is necessary to pass the disease along? Theoretically,
it doesn't matter if BSE can infect humans if we never eat
enough meat within a lifetime. Last year, calculations were
made to determine how many people will have consumed a
potentially infectious dose by 1997. The conservative
estimate runs upwards of 34 million people. In other words,
virtually a whole generation of people may die. And we are
not talking about a quick and simple death, either. If we
assume the disease runs a course similar to CJD, these people
will wake up one morning twitching and deteriorate weekly
into blindness and epilepsy, while their brain perforates
into a sponge. If they're lucky, they will be dead within
three months; if not, it may take up to five years.&quot;</P>
<P>This disease has the potential to be far more widespread
and deadly than AIDS or cancer, than heart disease or stroke.
And we don't know we have it until it is far, far too late to
do anything about, not to mention the fact that there is, at
the moment, nothing we can do about it. Americans' trust in
our own government has already fallen to such a low level
that we rarely believe its self-serving, exculpatory
statements. We must now, however, find a way to let the
government know, in no uncertain terms, that we are outraged
at the suicidal behavior of the factory farming industry and
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which is charged with
the often contradictory tasks of regulating and promoting
American agriculture. </P>
<P>Though we, as Gerson Persons, are basically vegetarians,
the practice of making vegetarian animals into cannibals puts
us all at risk from the most apparently innocuous substances,
and from contaminated water that cannot be purified short of
expensive steam distillation. We must force our governmental
organs to be responsive to our health and safety, and soon,
if we are not to fall victims en masse to the same fate as so
many Britons have already. We must fight for our survival
against our own food suppliers, and against our own
government, against the very institutions we want to believe
are protecting us. We know the results of trusting the FDA
and the NCI to help us. </P>
<P>This one, however, is a battle we cannot afford to lose.
