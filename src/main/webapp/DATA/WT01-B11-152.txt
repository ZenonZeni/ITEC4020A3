<B>Support For CWIP Continues, Says Hodgson
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources provided $191,000 to fund volunteers working on 140 Community Wildlife Involvement Program (CWIP) projects across Ontario in 1996, announced Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>

"I am very pleased that MNR has been able to continue supporting this valuable wildlife program and I want to thank all the volunteers who donated their time and energy," said Hodgson.  "CWIP projects are grass-root efforts and they demonstrate the substantial contributions that dedicated individuals and groups are prepared to make to Ontario's wildlife."<P>

Examples of some projects undertaken in 1996 are the erection of osprey platforms by the Friends of Charleston Lake and wild turkey trapping and relocations performed by the South-Central Big Game Association.  Other types of CWIP projects undertaken this year include habitat rehabilitation, tree planting, nesting box construction, clover seeding and wild rice planting.<P> 

Under the CWIP program, MNR provides start-up money and technical expertise to organized volunteers after their wildlife project is approved by the ministry.  This start-up money is primarily used for purchasing materials and supplies while a group or individual provides all the labour to complete the project.<P>

To qualify for CWIP funding, a project must meet one or more of the following objectives:<P>
<UL>
<LI>increased variety, abundance and distribution of Ontario's wildlife and wildlife habitat
<LI>increased knowledge of Ontario's wildlife resources
<LI>stronger relations between landowners, outdoor recreationists and interest groups.
</UL>
Funding for CWIP projects now comes from the special account established last year by MNR to support fish and wildlife management activities using revenue collected from fish and wildlife licence fees, royalties and fines.<P>

Interested groups or individuals should contact their local MNR District Office for further information on the program or projects in their area.<P>
