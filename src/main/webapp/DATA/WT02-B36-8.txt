MAJORS TURN TO JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES TO FINANCE OVERSEAS
DEVELOPMENT

      Major oil companies are emphasizing joint ventures and alliances
as they move to develop overseas projects. Leading U.S. producers have
worked with foreign entities since oil first was discovered outside
the United States. But the new agreements include financing by non-
U.S. participants that effectively makes them fuller partners as the
world oil industry continues to evolve.
   The most recent agreements include a $210 million investment by
Korea Petroleum Development Corp. (PEDCO) in exchange for a 15% stake
in Texaco Inc.'s Captain field in the British North Sea, and a multi-
faceted alliance between Chevron Corp. and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
subsidiary Maraven S.A. to develop the Boscan field in Venezuela and
supply heavy crude to Chevron in the United States.
   Chevron's arrangement makes it the first publicly traded multi-
national oil firm since 1975 to be responsible for such a high level
of Venezuelan production. It expects to spend $2 billion over a 20-to-
30-year period in the heavy oil field. The San Francisco-based company
will be responsible for Boscan operations and production (which it
plans to increase from 80,000 barrels per day to 150,000 b/d over the
next three years), while Maraven will handle marketing.
   The alliance, which covers an initial 20-year term with a 10-year
extension option, will make Maraven Chevron's joint venture partner in
a West Coast asphalt business, the Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance.
"Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees, is an excellent
asphalt feedstock," notes Dave O'Reilly, president of subsidiary
Chevron USA Products Co. Maraven also will supply crude to Chevron's
refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., and its asphalt plants at Perth Amboy,
N.J.; Portland, Ore., and Richmond Beach, Wash.
   Texaco, which previously owned 100% of the Captain field, will
continue to be its operator. It expects 60,000 b/d of initial
production, beginning in 1996's fourth quarter. Since a portion of the
project's expenditures will be lease-financed, PEDCO will assume a 15%
obligation for the financing. The companies expect to complete their
transaction during 1996's first quarter.
   "In addition to acquiring an investment partner with this alliance,
Texaco gains an important business relationship with PEDCO -- one that
will provide access to market opportunities in the Far East and in
other potential project developments," maintains York LeCorgne,
managing director of exploration and production at affiliate Texaco
U.K. Ltd. "The formation of strategic alliances is an important
element in Texaco's plan for growth and allows the company to expand
its core oil and gas activities worldwide."

BROCK'S MERGER INTO KEY MAY BE FIRST OF MANY AMONG SMALL INDEPENDENTS

   By Wall Street's standards, Key Production Co. Inc.'s approximately
$13 million all-stock acquisition of Brock Exploration Corp. is
relatively minor. But it could signal a consolidation among smaller
publicly traded independent producers every bit as intense as the
sales of domestic production properties and formation of joint
ventures by major oil companies, a leading oil analyst contends.
   "It could take place across the board. People who had good years in
1992 and 1993 following 10 years of the natural gas `bubble' are
beginning to say, `Never again!' after several warm winters," says
Joseph Culp of A.G. Edwards and Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Just as the
majors are amalgamating their domestic assets, the smaller producers
are doing the same thing, only with stock because they don't have as
much financial leverage." Key Production and Brock will structure
their merger as a tax-free exchange, with Brock shareholders receiving
one Key common share for every 1.45 Brock share. Key also intends to
open a regional office in New Orleans that will be staffed by several
employees who previously worked for Brock.
   Brock Exploration's sale has been expected since the New Orleans
independent producer issued its 1994 annual report with a front cover
featuring Lawrence E. Brock, the chairman and founder, posing with his
wife, Lorena, who was corporate secretary, standing on a Gulf of
Mexico beach alongside the words, "We toiled for 28 years! We left our
tracks! It's time to go! Adios, Amigos!" Brock is in his early 80s.
His wife is about 10 years younger.
   What took some observers by surprise was Denver-based Key
Production's role of purchaser. "It obviously brings it onto the Gulf
Coast. But it's a big move for Key beyond its Rocky Mountain and
California bases that I frankly didn't expect because I haven't
followed the company that closely," says one analyst who asked not to
be named.
   Culp, who does track Key, says that the deal makes perfect sense.
"It apparently is a combination of someone who probably said, `My
better days in the oil business are behind me,' with someone else who
said, `I'll let you ride a little bit on my coattails, but I also want
to diversify my assets,'" he tells Petroleum Finance Week. "Key has
been a financially sound company all along that's been able to acquire
properties and then aggressively exploit them. Apparently, it was able
to strike an all-stock deal based on its record of being able to do
something positive with its assets. It's going to be able to pay for
this because its recent acquisitions in California are beginning to
bear fruit."
   Key Chairman Francis H. "Mick" Merelli and Brock say that they
believe the combined companies will be more efficient and stronger
than either one was by itself. The merger has to be approved by both
companies' shareholders, who will vote on the proposal at special
meetings in February. Key intends to file the necessary registration
covering the new shares it intends to issue with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as soon as possible. The companies expect the
combination to be complete this spring.
   Culp considers Key a relative sleeper among small independents and
Merelli "a well-respected guy who walks in the circles of the large
independents. He can get an audience and do deals that surprise some
people. But he has always been very good at being conservative and not
taking big drilling risks. He also has made some good strategic
acquisitions. The company tends to hide its light under a bushel,
preferring to let its actions speak louder than its words. If people
understood the kind of value it offered, it would have a much higher
share price."

NORAM ENERGY COMPLETES TWO BANK CREDIT FACILITIES TOTALING $550
MILLION

   NorAm Energy Corp. completed two bank credit facilities totaling
$550 million with a group of 22 banks. The facilities are a $150
million term loan and an amended $400 million revolving credit, which
will allow NorAm to release two pipeline subsidiaries that it
previously provided the banks as security and provide the integrated
natural gas company financing at a lower price and with reduced
borrowing fees. CitiBank was agent for both facilities. Bank of
Montreal and NationsBank of Texas were lead managers of the revolving
credit, the terms of which were extended to December 1998.
   The $150 million term loan is a five-year facility, which will
generate proceeds for NorAm to redeem $150 million of 8% notes due
January 1997, which it called at par on Nov. 22, 1995, and redeemed on
Dec. 22. This facility, as well as the revolving credit, includes a
pricing grid where the facility and borrowing codes are reduced once
debt rating services Standard and Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service upgrade specific assessments.
   "These two facilities were well received by the banking community,
with both being well over-subscribed," notes NorAm Chief Financial
Officer Michael B. Bracy. "The improved terms in the revolving credit
reflect NorAm Energy's continuing improvement in credit quality,
reflected by debt reduction and improved results from operations. The
release of the security previously provided by [pipeline subsidiaries
NorAm Gas Transmission Co. and Mississippi River Transportation Corp.]
to the banks is another step toward management's goal of returning
NorAm Energy to an investment grade."

AMOCO, UNOCAL EMPHASIZE OVERSEAS PROJECTS IN 1996 E&P SPENDING PLANS

      -- Pennzoil's '96 Outlays Will Slightly Exceed 1995 Level --
   Continuing a well-established trend among major U.S. oil companies,
Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. each emphasized overseas exploration and
production prospects as they announced capital spending plans for
1996.
   Chicago-based Amoco announced a capital spending and exploration
budget of $4.7 billion, a 12% increase from the $4.2 billion approved
for 1995. The rise follows an increase last year of 31% from 1994's
$3.2 billion, "a pattern of strong re-investment" that compares with
average annual spending of $3.4 billion during the 1990-94 period.
   "The continued growth in our spending is a clear indication of the
success of our 1994 restructuring," Amoco Chairman H. Laurance Fuller
says. "That restructuring has allowed us to reduce costs, accelerate
decision-making and empower our business groups to more quickly bring
forward projects that we believe will provide profitable growth. In
fact, additional funds above the $4.7 billion level could be made
available to take advantage of other opportunities. For example, we
currently are negotiating the purchase of Albemarle Corp.'s olefins
derivatives business, the cost of which is not included in this
budget."
   Of the $2.8 billion that Amoco has budgeted for 1996 exploration
and production outlays (about 60% of the total), overseas projects
account for $1.4 billion, up from $1.15 billion of the nearly $2.68
billion E&P total in 1995. Significant projects include construction
of a liquefied natural gas plant in Trinidad and a program of highly
focused exploratory drilling. Startup of crude oil and natural gas
production in China and gas production in China and continuation of
Egyptian and North Sea programs also are included. U.S. E&P spending
will fall to an even $1 billion from nearly $1.08 billion in 1995,
while outlays in Canada will decline by $50 million, year-to-year, to
$400 million in 1996.
   The company expects to spend $525 million for refining and
marketing improvements ($450 million in the United States and $75
million overseas), principally to upgrade gasoline marketing
operations. In 1995, it spent $600 million downstream ($575 million in
the United States and $25 million overseas).
   Amoco has budgeted $1.25 billion in chemical outlays for 1996, $875
million of which is planned for the United States and $375 million
slated for overseas, where new facilities or expansions are under way
in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Belgium. In 1995, its chemical
spending totaled $900 million, with $575 million spent in the United
States and $325 million spent overseas.

With Downstream Outlays Essentially Complete, Unocal Turns its
Attention Upstream...

   Unocal budgeted $920 million, or 68% of its forecast $1.25 billion
capital spending total, for exploration and production, a 10.8%
increase from the $830 million it spent on E&P in 1995. The 1996 total
is slightly below the estimated $1.4 billion that Unocal spent overall
last year. "We have significantly reduce the capital allocated to our
downstream segment now that we've completed the refinery modifications
to manufacture California-mandated reformulated gasoline," Unocal
Chairman Roger C. Beach says. "This frees capital for new projects in
Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia, as well
as the oil project in Azerbaijan that will create significant value
for the company."
   Approximately $530 million of the $920 million budgeted for E&P is
earmarked for overseas oil and gas activities, up 43% from an
estimated $370 million in foreign upstream outlays during 1995.
Domestic E&P spending is budgeted at $390 million this year, down from
$460 million in 1995. Some 64% of the U.S. upstream budget is slated
for development of key natural gas projects in Louisiana and the Gulf
of Mexico.
   Unocal earmarked another $240 million for worldwide exploration,
$170 million, or 71%, of which will be spent for projects near
existing operations that the company believes have a high potential
for success.
   Planned expenditures for Unocal's 76 Products Co. division, which
encompasses its West Coast refining and marketing holdings, are $230
million for 1996, a 41% drop from 1995's $390 million. About $100
million is designated for marketing, principally the addition of quick
service restaurants, convenience stores, car washes and other new
profit centers to existing retail sites. Another $90 million is
planned for Unocal's California refineries on projects to enhance
profitability and meet environmental regulations.
   Spending for geothermal and power projects are expected to nearly
double to $110 million in 1996 and focus on projects in Indonesia.
Diversified businesses (agricultural products, carbon and minerals
operations, pipelines and real estate development) will receive $50
million, a 29% drop from 1995's $70 million when Unocal started up an
ammonia and urea manufacturing plant in Finley, Wash.
   Another integrated U.S. oil firm, Pennzoil Co., announced a 1996
capital budget totaling $474 million, up from the approximately $472
million that it expects to spend in 1995. The Houston company will
spend $233 million on oil and gas exploration, $214 million on motor
oil and refined products operations and $27 million on franchises and
other operations. The company also announced that it has hedged a
substantial portion of its 1996 oil and gas production as part of a
risk management program that it established in 1994.

TENNECO, QUESTAR CANCEL KERN RIVER DEAL AFTER UNFAVORABLE FTC RULING

   Citing the potential concentration of market power for Questar
Pipeline Co. in the Salt Lake City area, the Federal Trade Commission
voted against allowing Tenneco Energy Co., a subsidiary of Tenneco
Inc., to sell its 50% interest in the Kern River natural gas
transmission system to the pipeline division of Salt Lake-based
Questar Corp.. The companies agreed last week not to legally challenge
the ruling and terminated the $225 million cash deal that was
announced Sept. 8.
   The transaction would have been the largest in Questar's history,
dwarfing its $94.5 million purchase in April 1994 of exploration and
production assets formerly held by Amax Oil and Gas Co. from Union
Pacific Resources Co.. "We really wanted this deal. But the FTC
apparently doesn't understand how the restructured natural gas
industry works and how difficult it has become for a pipeline to
dominate a market," a Questar spokesman tells Petroleum Finance Week.
"It has sent a signal that we intend to aggressively grow and will
pursue other opportunities. But the growth won't be with Kern River."
   The 904-mile pipeline runs from Opal, in southwestern Wyoming, to
Bakersfield, Calif. It delivers 700 million cubic feet of gas per day
to customers that include local distribution companies, direct end-
users, electricity cogenerators and enhanced oil recovery systems.
Tulsa-based Williams Companies Inc. owns the remaining half interest
in Kern River.
   "We are disappointed with the Federal Trade Commission's ruling and
don't agree with it," says Tenneco Energy Chairman Steve Chesebro'.
"However, during the bidding process, we received a high level of
interest from several qualified bidders. We plan to reopen contact
with these parties in the next few days, with the goal of competing
the sale in a timely manner."

PARKER DRILLING WILL BECOME FIRST U.S. LAND DRILLER IN VIETNAM

   A subsidiary of Parker Drilling Co. will become the first Western
drilling contractor to work onshore in Vietnam, officials disclosed at
the Tulsa company's annual meeting. Parker Drilling International Ltd.
will drill two wells south of Hanoi for Australian oil company Anzoil
N.L. near the Gulf of Tonkin coast. Further contract terms were not
disclosed. "Parker has a long tradition in pioneering new drilling
markets. Vietnam holds great potential and we plan to establish a
long-term presence in this energy-rich country," said Parker Drilling
President Robert L. Parker Jr. In 1980, the company became the first
U.S. onshore drilling contractor to gain a contract in the People's
Republic of China. It became the first Western drilling contractor to
work in the former Soviet Union in 1991 and the first to enter
Kazakhstan in 1992.

LYONDELL PETROCHEMICAL ADOPTS POISON PILL THAT PARTIALLY EXCLUDES ARCO

   Lyondell Petrochemical Co. adopted a 10-year shareholder rights
plan, effective Dec. 20, 1995, that its directors say is designed to
protect shareholders in the event of a proposed change of control at
the Houston petrochemical producer and petroleum refiner. Like other
so-called "poison pills," the plan would be implemented with
distribution of common stock purchase rights as a dividend if a person
or group acquires 15% or more of Lyondell's outstanding common shares,
or if a tender or exchange offer is commenced that would have that
effect. The plan provides an exception for Atlantic Richfield Co.,
which currently holds 49.9% of Lyondell's stock. But it could be
activated if Arco decided to accumulate additional shares.

WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT DEREGULATED ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPETITION? NOT
ATMOS

   The prevailing sentiment is that natural gas demand will suffer
initially because the electric industry, once it is decontrolled, will
be so much more competitive. "For a low-cost, efficient provider like
Atmos Energy Corp., competition brings more opportunity than concern,"
declared Robert F. Stephens, president and chief operating officer of
the Dallas-based, multi-state natural gas utility holding company.
   "We're old hands at competition in the industrial market,
particularly in our Kentucky service area, where 59% of our throughput
is to large-volume customers," he said during a recent Atmos
presentation to the New York Society of Security Analysts. "We're also
accustomed to competition at the retail level from other energy
sources, and compete for customers against some very low-cost electric
utilities."
   The company has stayed ahead of other natural gas distributors in
making sure its operations are streamlined and efficient. Stephens
said that it has 400 customers per employee, compared to an industry
average of 380. Its operating expenses are among the industry's
lowest. And its plant investment per meter is below the industry's
average.
   Atmos also reduced its already low average cost of gas per thousand
cubic feet during fiscal 1995 (ending Sept. 30) to $2.46 because its
market-sensitive contracts let customers benefit from lower wellhead
prices while keeping the company competitive. "By operating
efficiently to keep its gas price low, looking for ways to trim gas
costs and providing a valuable resource to its customers to reduce
their total energy bills, Atmos has achieved a record of success in
competitive markets," said Stephens.
   James F. Purser, Atmos' executive vice president and chief
financial officer, pointed out that the company achieved a 12.3%
return on average shareholder equity during fiscal 1995 from earnings
that rose 28.6% (despite weather in its utilities' Texas, Colorado,
Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana and Kentucky service areas that was 10.3%
warmer than normal) to $18.9 million, or $1.22 per share from fiscal
1994's $14.7 million, or 97 cents per share.
   Cash flow per share increased 40% in fiscal 1995 to $3.02 from
fiscal 1994's $2.46, with the help of rate increases totaling $2.8
million during fiscal 1995. Atmos has established an ambitious
building program for fiscal 1996, including a second Colorado gas
processing plant and gathering system upgrades in Colorado and Kansas.
But the company is holding to a debt-to-equity ratio target between
40% and 60%, Purser indicated. "Regulators, obviously, have an impact
on that, although it has not been a bone of contention in any of our
rate cases where we have explained our capital structure," he said.
   Atmos' wide-spread gas utility operations make it distinctive among
local distribution companies -- and frequently mentioned as a
purchaser when it comes to acquisitions. "Looking at acquisitions is a
regular ongoing activity for our company," Stephens confirmed. "We
have enough experience that, generally, if someone is considering
selling a piece of property, we're generally invited to look at it."
   Most government regulators are hesitant to allow recovery from a
utility's acquisitions that are above book rate. Atmos supports this
idea, but adds that there are occasional instances where an
acquisition above book value should be allowed because it would be in
the public interest. "The kind of regulation that's present and the
kind of economy that a prospective addition operates in determines how
much we're willing to pay," said Stephens. "But our interest is piqued
if something different is offered."
   Atmos does not set a limit on the size of a deal because that would
limit its opportunities. "There are lenders who will finance $200
million if a deal offers very favorable returns," said Stephens. He
conceded that earnings dilution is almost inevitable following
acquisitions. But he also emphasized that Atmos' purchases have not
diluted payouts to shareholders permanently, "and we plan to make
certain that it won't happen."
   He said that Atmos is aware that several primarily electric
utilities are thinking of divesting their gas holdings. "We're finding
that an equal number, if not more, tend to view their service role as
energy products and are quite happy to have gas as a part of their
companies. I do expect several to shift more of their operations into
separate components, and that could provide more opportunity for a
company like ours," said Stephens.
   Asked if Atmos might consider acquiring electric assets, he
promptly replied, "We certainly would. We realize the reality of the
situation with electric companies' balance sheets and their higher
investment per customer. That would make an acquisition very difficult
financially for any gas company. But we would be interested if we
found a deal that makes financial sense."

DUFF AND PHELPS, FITCH TAKE POSITIVE VIEWS TOWARD ENRON FOR DIFFERENT
REASONS

   Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Co. and Fitch Investors Service took
a positive view toward Enron Corp. in separate ratings actions. Fitch
sees an improving credit trend for the Houston integrated natural gas
company because it is structuring its businesses to compete on a
vertically-integrated basis worldwide in all of its operating
segments. DCR applauds Enron's sale of more than 25% of Enron Oil and
Gas Co. because Enron will use the approximately $690 million of
proceeds to reduce its short-term debt. But the ratings service also
cites uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the Dabhol power
project in India and resolution of a dispute over the J-block natural
gas contract. The Enron Oil and Gas stock sale involved two separate
transactions: the direct sale of more than 31 million shares and the
sale of 10 million 6.5% interchangeable notes, which DCR and Fitch
rate Triple B-Plus, with mandatory common share conversion provisions.
DCR also affirmed its Triple B-Plus ratings of Enron's senior notes, a
Triple B assessment its senior subordinated debt and a Triple B-Minus
rating of its convertible preferred.
   Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corp. affirmed
their assessments of Talisman Energy Inc.'s senior debt following
Talisman's announcement that it will acquire Goal Petroleum Plc. (LSE)
for C$315 million in a debt-financed transaction. S&P, which assesses
Talisman's debt Triple B-Plus, sees a stable outlook for the company
because the purchase is consistent with Talisman's operating strategy
and will reduce its dependence on North American natural gas markets.
But Moody's, which rates the issue "Baa1", changed its outlook for the
Calgary independent oil and gas producer's credit to negative from
stable. Goal is a British independent producer active in the British
North Sea, and its acquisition is consistent with Talisman's goal to
increase its reserves outside Canada. Proved reserves, which total
approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent, are primarily
crude oil and include a 32% interest in the Blenheim field. Moody's is
concerned over the deal's size, the fact that it is being financed
with debt and the continuing impact of low gas prices.
   Moody's affirmed its "b1" rating of Tejas Gas Corp.'s preferred
stock while Standard and Poor's Corp. raised its assessment of the
Houston gas gathering, transmission and marketing company's issue to
Double B-Minus. Moody's also assigned a "Ba1" rating to the $455
million revolving credit facility of the Tejas Acadian Holding unit,
citing the parent company's relatively stable results, sensitivity of
earnings to gas prices and resulting pressures on margins from intense
competition in Gulf Coast markets. Both ratings services favorably
view opportunities from Coral Energy Resources, a gas marketing joint
venture in which Tejas has a one-third interest and Shell Oil Co.
holds a two-thirds stake. Coral, which began to operate in November,
is expected to assure higher volumes for Tejas' transmission system
and to expand its marketing capabilities.
   S&P placed a Single B-Minus rating on KCS Energy's $150 million of
senior unsecured notes, with a Single B corporate rating and a
positive credit outlook. S&P considers KCS "a small independent
exploration and production company with an aggressive financial
profile and above-average finding costs." Its positive outlook assumes
a favorable outcome for a gas contract dispute and moderate Rocky
Mountain drilling successes leading to improvements in finding and
development costs that are higher than average.
   In its first assessment of Public Service Co. of North Carolina,
Moody's assigned a preliminary "A2" rating to the Gastonia, N.C.,
natural gas utility's $125 million shelf registration for senior
unsecured debt. The assessment reflects PSNC's strong and relatively
stable earnings and cash flow, management's commitment to maintain a
conservative balance sheet and the absence of non-gas-related
subsidiaries. The rating also considers the company's small size
relative to other publicly traded gas utilities, its relatively high
average dividend payout ratio and the short-term nature of its
committed bank facilities.
