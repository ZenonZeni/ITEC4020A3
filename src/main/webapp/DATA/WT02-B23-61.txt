<B>For immediate release </B><P>
<B>January 2, 1995</B><P>
<CENTER><B>Quarterly journal Marine Watch launched</B></CENTER><P>
	Marine Watch, a  journal about events occurring on, under, and over the oceans of the world, debuted this month with a mailing of complimentary first issue copies to selected individuals in the earth sciences, the maritime and commercial fishing industries, the Navy and Coast Guard, and to members of  the sailing, diving, and surfing communities. <P>
	Geared to an informed readership, the quarterly is initially 16-20 pages in size (with no advertising)  and features authoritative in-depth reporting about a wide range of events of interest to the ocean community.  Charter subscriptions are $30 for individuals, $50 for vessels, agencies, business and institutions. <P>
	"Marine Watch is intended  for an audience composed of two groups," explains John Grissim, the journal's editor and publisher.  "On the one hand are scientists, researchers, skilled specialists and scholars in government, academia, and the private sector whose work involves the marine world and the earth sciences.  And on the other are professional mariners, sailors, boaters, underwater archeologists, sport and commercial fishers, surfers, divers, treasure salvers, and blue water adventurers. Both have a lot to share with each other and both have in common a deep knowledge and appreciation of the marine world." <P>
	Grissim, who is producing Marine Watch from Point Reyes Station, California, on the coast an hour north of San Francisco, has spent three years preparing for the journal's launch, drawing upon his 27 years experience as a  journalist (and author of seven books).  A  longtime surfer, fisherman, diver and lover of the ocean, he has been a communications officer on a U.S. Navy fleet oiler (Pacific),  edited the Australian surfing magazine <I>Tracks</I>, was a member of the dive team that discovered and salvaged the $20 million Spanish treasure galleon Concepcion north of the Dominican Republic in 1978, and  has crewed on West Coast salmon and herring boats. He has contributed to a number of national magazines, including <I>National Fisherman, Omni,  Playboy, Rolling Stone, Smithsonian, Oceans, Surfing, </I>and<I> Surfer</I>,  mostly on subjects that have some bearing on marine science and technology and the sea. <P>
	He explains that one impetus for the venture was the lack of publications that feature substantive writing about the ocean for the ocean community.  "There are fine periodicals out there for sailors, scuba divers, the maritime industry, the marine sciences, fishermen,  weather forecasters, you name it, but oddly,  not a single periodical devoted to the ocean. Marine Watch intends to help fill that void." <P>
	Marine Watch will  report on marine related news from a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from shipwrecks, shark attacks, severe weather, sea floor exploration, oceanography, and treasure salvage, to blue water cruising, surf stories, ocean oddities, high tech undersea research, even accounts by credible witnesses of encounters with marine cryptids ("We will avoid the pejorative term 'sea monster while keeping an open mind").   Grissim adds the editorial philosophy will be, in general,  non-political. "We're concerned less with the lubberly disputes of shore folk than with accurate reporting of actual ocean events. But underlying much that will be reported will be an implicit deep concern for the environmental emergency that has begun to manifest in Earth's oceans." <P>
	Regardless of the topic, the writing is geared for readers with a high level of comprehension. "We don't expect every surfer or sailor to be conversant with Doppler hook echoes and Kelvin waves, nor every scientist to know what a backside layback stall is,  or a helium unscrambler, or the difference between a checkerboard and a trawl door, but Marine Watch won't shy away from the technical or the arcane. We figure our readers have the  expertise and marine experience to dope out what they need to know and prefer it that way." <P>
	Marine Watch will be in close touch with its readers, reporting news of their marine activities, sightings, and experiences. To facilitate this exchange, Grissim will  mount a Marine Watch home page on the Web by the end of January, 1996. <P>
