<HR> <P>

Many school districts are still wrestling with the issue of how best to design  and implement inclusive programs.  The National Longitudinal Study, as cited by  the U.S. Department of Education (1994) indicates that the success of students  with disabilities in regular education classes is related to the supports and  services they receive. <P>

Studies have indicated that when general education classes are modified to  accommodate the needs of students with disabilities, these students have  improved educational outcomes.  For students with severe disabilities, these  outcomes include better social development, more social interactions, enhanced  skill acquisition and generalization, better health, more independence, greater  success in meeting the objectives of individualized educational plans (IEPs),  more positive attitudes on the part of nondisabled peers and others in the  community, and more normalized adult functioning.  For students with mild  disabilities, studies found that integrated placements resulted in higher  academic achievement and greater socioemotional growth.  Recent research  suggests that the more students with disabilities are included in general  education classrooms and other age-appropriate environments, the more likely  they are to have positive outcomes (Hunt, Farron-Davis, Staub, Beckstead,  Curtis, Karasoff, & Sailor, 1992).<P>

This report documents what has been learned through the National Longitudinal  Transition Study (NLTS) of Special Education Students about regular education  and secondary students with disabilities.  Findings are based on data from more  than 8,000 youth in secondary special education, ages 13 to 21, in 1985-86.   Focus of the report is on how much time students spent in regular education and  the effects of regular education on outcomes independent of student and other  characteristics.  After an introductory chapter, chapter 2 presents a general  description of the methodology of the NLTS and a discussion of analytic  considerations unique to this report.  Chapter 3 looks at characteristics of  students with disabilities in regular education.  Chapter 4 describes academic  and social outcomes during high school associated with time in regular  education.  Outcomes for young adults in the areas of postsecondary education,  employment, independent living, and community participation are presented in  chapter 5. Chapter 6 synthesizes findings from the NLTS about regular education  and secondary school students with disabilities.  (Contains 41 references.) (DB)<BR>

This paper presents findings of a 6-year study exploring factors contributing  to postsecondary school attendance or nonattendance by youth with disabilities  based on data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special  Education Students (NLTS) for 8,000 students, ages 13 through 21, with  disabilities.  Factors found to be related to enrollment in postsecondary  institutions included student ability/achievement, parental education,  family/school urbanicity, parent expectations, enrollment in academic classes,  and involvement in high school group activities.  Students who were  mainstreamed in high school academic classes were found to be more likely to go  on to postsecondary education, and students who displayed antisocial or  behavioral problems were found to be less likely to enroll in postsecondary  education.  Findings for postsecondary academic programs were similar to those  for vocational programs.  Appendices provide background information on the NLTS  sample and a list of 19 reports and papers based on the NLTS.  (Contains 45  references.) (PB)<BR>

This paper focuses on the secondary school experiences of Hispanic students  with disabilities, presenting findings from the National Longitudinal  Transition Study (NLTS) of Special Education Students.  The 5-year NLTS study  included data on more than 8,000 students (of whom 733 were Hispanic) enrolled  in special education in the 1985-86 school year.  The data provided in this  report were collected in 1987 from telephone interviews with parents of the  NLTS Hispanic youth.  The paper begins with a description of individual and  family background factors, such as disability category, functional skills,  youth demographics and household characteristics.  It continues with a  description of students' secondary school experiences including school  characteristics (such as size and urbanicity) and school policies and practices  regarding instructional placement and vocational education services and  programs.  The paper then focuses on aspects of student school performance and  activities related to vocational and instructional placement experiences  including absenteeism, school completion, employment during secondary school,  and participation in extracurricular activities.  Findings indicated that  Hispanic students with disabilities were unlikely to be in racially integrated  or mainstream settings, had fewer vocational training opportunities than other  special education students, and were unlikely to participate in extracurricular  group activities.  An appendix presents background information on the NLTS.   (35 references) (DB)<BR>

This report presents findings of a 5-year study on the transition of youth  with disabilities from secondary school to early adulthood.  The study included  more than 8,000 youth with disabilities who were aged 13 to 21 and receiving  special education in 1985-86.  It examined experiences of the students in  education, employment, and personal independence.  Data included interviews  with students' parents in 1987, analysis of school records, and a survey of  educators, followed up by 1989 interviews with a subsample of 800 parents  and/or youth.  An executive summary reports major findings addressing:  characteristics of youth with disabilities, secondary school programs of  students in regular schools, secondary school programs of students in special  schools, secondary school performance, secondary school completion, social  integration, personal and residential independence, employment, enrollment in  postsecondary schools, engagement in productive activities outside the home,  youth with emotional disturbances, youth with visual impairments, severely  impaired youth, young women with disabilities, the economically disadvantaged,  the link between secondary school and postschool outcomes, occupationally  oriented vocational training, regular education placements, work experience  during high school, and social activities.  The report provides narrative  analysis and many tables detailing findings in 11 chapters: "Introduction"  (Mary Wagner); "More Than a Label: Characteristics of Youth with Disabilities"  (Camille Marder and Robert Cox); "Secondary School Programs" (Mary Wagner);  "Secondary School Performance" (Mary Wagner); "Sticking It Out: Secondary  School Completion" (Mary Wagner); "Social Activities" (Lynn Newman); "Growing  Up, Moving On: Aspects of Personal and Residential Independence" (Lynn Newman);  "The Working World Awaits: Employment Experiences during and Shortly after  Secondary School" (Ronald D'Amico); "Enrollment in Postsecondary Schools" (Paul  Butler-Nalin and Mary Wagner); "A Broader Look at Outcomes: Engagement in  Productive Activities after Secondary School" (E.  Deborah Jay); and  "Reflections" (Mary Wagner.) Five commentaries by leading professionals (Alan  Abeson, Bud Fredericks, Teresa Middleton, Irving Kenneth Zola, and Jeffrey V.  Osowski) and four appendixes conclude the report.  References are provided for  most chapters.  (DB)<BR>

This study examined the management, operation, and effectiveness of special  education programs in 33 urban school districts from 1984-85 through 1986-87.   Data were collected on special education students, facilities, budgets, pre- referral, referral, placement, exit from special education programs, program  evaluation, vocational education, related services, special education  complaints and hearings, mainstreaming, and student progress evaluation  criteria.  Findings are organized around six underlying themes: the stability  of school district enrollments and funding for special education programs; the  referral and subsequent placement of students in special education programs;  the incidence of complaints and hearings; the impact of federal and state  regulations on program evaluation; the integration of special and regular  education programs; and policy and program recommendations.  No major  increasing trends were found in enrollment or expenditures over the years  studied.  Numbers of inappropriate referrals were reduced.  Complaints and  hearings were not a major problem in most areas, and most special education  students were enrolled in buildings that also held regular education classes.   Recommendations based on these and other findings are offered.  Eleven  appendices describe the study's methodology and present raw data.  (PB)<BR>

The concerns of Kansas educators about the implementation of the Education  for All Handicapped Children Act (P.L.  94-142) mandate are examined in this  research report.  Five different samples of public school educators, totaling  7,000 persons, were randomly selected and stratified according to district size. Each sample was sent either the Stages of Concerns Questionnaire (SoCQ) or the  General Concerns Inventory (GCI).  Returns were obtained from between 32 and 39  percent of the different samples.  The hypothesis central to the study was that  the developmental sequence of concerns is predictable and can be observed and  measured.  The longitudinal design provided a basis for (1) an annual  examination of educators' concerns regarding P.L.  94-142, (2) assessment of  the change in stages of concern over time, (3) a test of the developmental  change theory, and (4) the design and development of a new instrument, the  General Concerns Inventory.  The results from 3 years of study (1978-80)  indicated that Kansas educators are still at an early stage of adoption of the  mandated policy and only modest developmental change has occurred in the  interval, though that change is in the hypothesized direction.  The  developmental theory received continued support.  (Author/MLF)<BR>
