  A parent and educator who has spent the past 10 years struggling to help her 
own ADHD (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder) child offers suggestions 
for managing the challenges facing such children and enhancing the quality of 
their lives.  Since drug regimens have limitations, parents need to read 
appropriate literature and receive instruction in behavior management.  (MLH)<BR>

diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).  After 
comprehensive behavioral and academic programs (including token rewards, peer 
tutoring, resource room activities, an inclass aide) failed to stabilize 
Tommy's behavior, Ritalin was (successfully) prescribed as a last resort.  (MLH)<BR>

  The rush to label schoolchildren as suffering from attention deficit disorder 
(ADD) or attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has reached nearly 
epidemic proportions.  The diagnosis often meets parents' needs to assign 
behavior control to Ritalin; it should be an explanation leading to genuine 
help, not a license for unacceptable student behavior.  (MLH)<BR>

  Teachers play an important role in monitoring the effects of stimulant 
medication used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Any 
negative attitudes they hold toward ADHD students or the students' parents, 
doctors, or medication, can compromise treatment efficacy.  To assess teachers' 
perceptions of ADHD concerning social variables, drug therapy, causal factors, 
parental support, teacher training, involvement, and experience with ADHD 
students, 206 teachers, drawn from 11 elementary, middle, and high schools, 
were administered a 44-item survey.  Comparative analysis revealed no 
significant relationship between teachers' stimulant attitudes and causal 
beliefs and their amount of experience with ADHD students.  Teachers who 
advocated the use of ritalin were more likely to believe in genetic causal 
factors, and seemed more sensitive and aware of the social, academic, and 
medical problems associated with these disorders.  Neither age nor experience 
appeared to mediate teachers' attitudes toward ADHD causes or treatment.  Most 
teachers desired a high responsibility role in helping students with ADHD.  
Older and more experienced teachers expressed dissatisfaction both with their 
college training and in-service training on stimulant medication.  Future 
studies may concentrate on the adequacy of teacher training on stimulant 
medication, both on the college level and through in-service training.  Contains six references.  (RJM)<BR>

  In response to a critique by Lori Bell Mick (EC 600 580), the original author 
counters objections to ideas concerning the nature of Ritalin, Ritalin's side 
effects, drug dependency, and teachers as classroom pushers.  The response 
concludes that evidence for Ritalin's positive effect on reading achievement in 
children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity is lacking.  (DB)<BR>

  In response to Robert Cooter, Jr.  (EC 202 670), who questioned the 
widespread use of Ritalin with children having attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorders, this commentary considers four specific points: how Ritalin works, 
Ritalin's side effects and relationship to Tourette syndrome, the assumption 
that Ritalin leads to drug abuse, and the allegation that "teachers are 
pushers." (DB)<BR>

  Target Audience: Parents<BR>
  This guide provides information to help parents decide whether their child 
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should take 
methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin).  Information is provided in a question-
and-answer format on various concerns, including: the meaning of ADHD, whether 
Ritalin is overprescribed, when this medication is appropriate and who can 
prescribe and monitor it, what research indicates about the effects of Ritalin, 
how to know if the medication is working, the effects of medication on family 
functioning, different forms and dosages of Ritalin, the effects of Ritalin on 
attention span and impulse control, effects of medication on social behavior 
and academic performance, age at which the medication can be started and 
whether it helps adults with hyperactive behavior, documented side effects of 
Ritalin, and unusual negative results that have been reported about Ritalin use.
Points for the parents to consider are summarized: the effects of Ritalin can 
be linked to the adequacy of dosage and regularity of intake; symptoms return 
once the medication wears off; along with the medication, behavior management 
and parent education or counseling are important; the medication may facilitate
the application of behavior management to improve control over ADHD symptoms; 
and at some point medication will be stopped.  (Contains 31 references.) (SW)<BR>
