Research in the division focuses on the antecedents and consequences of substance use and abuse, with particular emphasis on the development and testing of novel approaches to the treatment of substance abuse. The division is unique in its ability to examine substance abuse issues at three levels: in non-human primates, in controlled laboratory research with human subjects, and, clinically, in treating cocaine-abusing patients. Faculty in this division not only conduct their own research, but, consistent with the major goals of the division, foster collaborative research both at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and across the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center complex.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In October 1994, the Division on Substance Abuse, in collaboration with Drs. Edward Nunes and Ronald Van Heertum at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, received a Medications Development Center grant from NIDA to develop novel medication approaches to treat cocaine and heroin abuse. The Core, in addition to providing centralized coordination and support, will carry out pilot studies on promising medications and provide funding for small pilot studies, including those of interest to the Research Fellows. Project 1, headed by Drs. Fischman and Comer, will focus on developing a laboratory model of smoked heroin and then use it in the Residential Laboratory to evaluate both new medications for opiate addiction, e.g., depot naltrexone and methoclocinnamox, as well as improving outcome and acceptability of existing medications such as methadone and naltrexone. In Project 2, Dr. Gottschalk, a Substance Abuse Research Fellow, is working with Dr. Van Heertum, examining the temporal course of cocaine's effects on regional brain activity using PET. These studies will examine human brain activation by intravenous cocaine in chronic abusers, using PET imaging techniques for measuring cerebral blood flow. The first experiment will examine direct drug effects of cocaine, tolerance effects, and conditioned cue response. Project 3, headed by Dr. Nunes, will evaluate treatment-seeking cocaine abusers and then use existing psychiatric medications to see whether treating specific disorders, such as depression, will improve outcome and retention. In addition, this project will use both a cue reaction paradigm and a novel clinical trial design to test new medications such as amoxapine and risperidone for cocaine treatment. A Cocaine Research Clinic will be opened on PI 11 to carry out this project and the Core pilot studies.

Dr. Richard Foltin is continuing his series of studies in non-human primates. His research project with baboons is providing both an animal model for assessing the behavioral mechanisms of action of anorectic drugs, with new substances evaluated as they are developed, and a behavioral economics model of eating behavior. Drs. Fischman, Foltin, Comer, and Haney are conducting similar studies in human subjects to investigate the neurochemical basis for the control of eating behavior in humans and to evaluate the commonalities and differences between food and drugs. Dr. Foltin, in collaboration with Dr. Evans, has another non-human primate research grant to develop and test a novel animal model of cocaine craving in rhesus monkeys. The availability of an animal model that operationalizes the concept of drug craving, i.e., cocaine-seeking rather than cocaine-<BR>
taking behavior, will provide an immense benefit to the development of pharmacotherapies specifically aimed at the alleviation of drug craving and subsequent drug taking.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Fischman and Foltin are continuing their research on the effects of cocaine, cocaine self-administration, and the interaction of cocaine with potential therapeutic agents using a controlled laboratory environment. Drs. Fischman and Foltin have developed a laboratory model of cocaine use in which volunteer cocaine-using research subjects can take repeated doses of cocaine, much as they might outside of the laboratory during a cocaine "binge." They measure cocaine self-administration before and during maintenance on a potential treatment medication to assess whether these proposed pharmacological adjuncts to cocaine treatment interfere with the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine. This is an efficient and scientifically useful adjunct to traditional clinical trial procedures for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of potential treatment medications.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cocaine abuse by patients maintained on methadone has become a serious problem. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of these two drugs in combination, and the clinical treatment efforts for this group have not been particularly effective. Drs. Fischman and Foltin are currently investigating the efficacy of buprenorphine as a treatment for both cocaine abuse and opiate dependence by examining the propensity to take cocaine in subjects maintained on either methadone or buprenorphine. Dr. Levin has been working with Dr. Foltin in developing protocols for optimal tapering of subjects off methadone and onto buprenorphine. This research will have clinical implications when buprenorphine is routinely used in methadone programs. Drs. Fischman, Evans, and Levin are evaluating another potentially useful medication for the treatment of cocaine abusers. They are studying <BR>
cis-flupenthixol, evaluating its safety in combination with cocaine and its efficacy both orally and in depot form. Drs. Foltin and Fischman are also conducting a laboratory analysis of cocaine abstinence including assessing changes in affect and reports of withdrawal symptoms following the termination of different doses and durations of a cocaine binge, changes in ratings of cocaine "craving" during abstinence, and differences in cocaine abstinence based on route of administration.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Fischman, Foltin, Comer, and Haney are conducting research on the workplace implications of drug use. The Substance Use Research Center is designed for continuous observation of human behavior over extended periods of time. Subjects can live under conditions in which sleep-waking cycles, daytime work activities, and evening recreational activities simulate those in the natural ecology. The effects of acute and chronic administration of frequently used drugs and medications on human capacities that are commonly used in the workplace are being evaluated. In addition, other studies will focus on residual drug effects, i.e., "hangover" on workplace performance, and the modification of drug use under workplace conditions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In collaboration with Dr. Fischman, Dr. Evans is continuing to conduct studies to assess the abuse liability of newly developed sedatives/anxiolytics prior to their marketing, as well as currently marketed sedatives/anxiolytics. Such procedures provide profiles of physiological and behavioral effects of these compounds including performance and memory impairment, as well as an estimate of the likelihood that they will be abused if they become commercially available. In October 1994, Dr. Fischman, in collaboration with Drs. Evans and Haney, received an NIH Women's Supplement to evaluate in women with premenstrual syndrome the effects of alprazolam on workplace performance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In line with the research mission of Psychiatric Institute, Drs. Kleber, Levin, and Evans have intensified their efforts in epidemiologic studies and new treatments for dually diagnosed patients, i.e., individuals with a substance abuse disorder (primarily cocaine) and another psychiatric disorder. To treat cocaine abuse more adequately, future studies may need to be targeted at different subgroups of cocaine abusers and to develop interventions appropriate to those populations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A NIDA-funded grant under the direction of Dr. Kleber and his associates, Drs. Levin and Evans, is assessing the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among cocaine abusers seeking treatment, including documentation of prevalence rates among specific minority populations. At the same time, parallel studies with cocaine abusers diagnosed with ADHD are being conducted in the research laboratory and these studies will focus on the interaction of cocaine with pharmacologic treatments for ADHD. Lastly, as part of the Core of the recently funded Center Grant, they will conduct an outpatient treatment study to assess the efficacy of methylphenidate and desipramine in reducing cocaine use in cocaine abusers with ADHD. Another subgroup of interest is cocaine abusers with schizophrenic symptoms. Drs. Levin and Evans are conducting studies to determine the effectiveness of the neuroleptics flupenthixol and risperidone in treating both the psychotic symptoms and reducing cocaine abuse in this patient population.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Levin recently received a Scientist Development Clinical Award to assess cocaine abusers for psychiatric co-morbidity and develop interventions appropriate to those subpopulations. In addition, Dr. Levin received a Clinical Trials Award to determine the effectiveness of the neuroleptics, flupenthixol and risperidone, in treating cocaine abusers with schizophrenia or schizo-affective illness.

</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Kleber and Levin have been actively involved with the Substance Abuse Steering Committee, co-chaired by Dr. Kleber and Dr. Oldham, in developing a new substance abuse curriculum for first- and second-year medical students. In addition, Drs. Kleber and Levin began a program to teach all housestaff at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center key aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of substance abuse. They are also working with Dr. Edward Nunes on courses for PGY-III and IV psychiatric residents.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Division continues to play a central role in a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded Research Fellowship in Substance Abuse Disorders for research fellows directed by Dr. Kleber and by the associate directors, Drs. Frances Levin and Edward Nunes. The purpose of this fellowship is to train candidates for careers in clinical research in substance abuse and dependence. The program is designed as a two-year curriculum with emphasis on four different components: didactic introduction to clinical research in the addictions, clinical experience, research apprenticeship-preceptorship, and development of teaching skills. From January-June 1994, the Division had two fellows-Michael Hwang, M.D., and Denise Hien, Ph.D. The former is now working as Director of the Anxiety Clinic at the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York City and is also Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at New York University. The latter received a FIRST Award from NIDA and is carrying out the research at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center. In July 1994, the division had two new Research Fellows, Dr. Christopher P. Gottschalk and Dr. Eric Collins. Dr. Angela Seracini, who is currently working with Dr. Nunes on the DES, will join the fellowship in January 1995.
