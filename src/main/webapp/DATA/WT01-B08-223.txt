</CENTER><B><I><img src="blueball.gif"> Business Executives Enforcement Teams [BEETs]</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> -- <B>In today's fast-paced and increasingly global business environment, staying on top of the information you need and knowing the rules of the game have become essential for survival.  From its  inception in 1991, the "Business Executives' Enforcement Team" (BEET) has become the forum for industry executives who need to stay current with the latest in practical, "hands-on" export enforcement topics.  Just as important, the BEET provides a direct communication link between the business and the export enforcement communities.  That's why BXA's Office of Export Enforcement, formed the BEET, and why  more than 2800 business executives have participated in this program, taking advantage of the unique opportunity to present their concerns and communicate directly with senior U.S. enforcement officials to learn about new and ongoing enforcement initiatives.<P>


Current BEET membership consists of individuals from various industries located throughout the United States.  As Export Enforcement reshapes its mission to reflect enhanced controls on weapons technologies -- chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and the means to deliver them, interaction with senior corporate officers of industries affected by these controls is especially welcomed.<P>


For further information on the upcoming BEET conferences, Export Enforcement's industry outreach programs, or on becoming a BEET member, please contact:<P>
