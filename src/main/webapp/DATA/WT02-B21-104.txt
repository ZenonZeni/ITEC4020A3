&amp; The Falkland Islands</FONT></B><BR>
29 January - 17 February 1998<BR>
20 Tour Days</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Dear Adventurer,</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty million years ago, Antarctica broke away from South America and became the world’s fifth largest continent. As the oceans flowed freely around the isolated land mass and temperate and polar waters mixed, the Antarctic continent cooled and ice sheets blanketed the land. The result - a vast white desert which holds over 90 percent of the world’s fresh water. Antarctica’s images are breathtaking. The wildlife, surrounded by a frozen pageantry of icebergs, glistening white glaciers and towering snow-capped peaks, offers unparalleled observation and photographic opportunities.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our voyage to Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands is scheduled during the height of the austral summer, when penguin rookeries are full of busy adults tending their hungry chicks. We will spend many hours watching the comical antics and curious personalities of Antarctica’s &quot;ambassadors&quot;.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vessel was specifically designed for passenger expeditions and her ice-hardened hull allows her to navigate easily in the most rugged natural environments. Critical to our expedition are her fleet of Zodiacs, which quickly and safely transport us to shore, allowing easy access to otherwise remote penguin colonies, seal rookeries and research stations. As the sun does not sink far below the horizon during this time of year, we will maximize our time ashore with landings early in the morning or even after dinner.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zegrahm &amp; Eco Expeditions well deserve the reputation for being the most experienced operator in Antarctica: combined, our leaders have visited the Great White Continent more than 250 times! Based on our experience, we have incorporated all of the best elements of an expedition to Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, including stops at several rarely-visited areas. Our voyage will follow in the wake of Sir Ernest Shackleton, from Antarctica to Elephant Island and on to South Georgia. We will spend six days on the Antarctic Peninsula and a day in the &quot;Inaccessible Islands&quot; - the magnificent South Orkneys - before continuing to the little-known natural wonderland of South Georgia.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wildlife sanctuary harbors thousands upon thousands of rarely-seen king penguins, the second largest and perhaps the most beautiful of all penguin species. The South Georgia Islands are also home to gentoo, chinstrap and macaroni penguins and four types of albatross, including the majestic wandering albatross - the world’s largest seabird with a wing span of up to 13 feet! Many protected bays hold the remains of abandoned whaling stations, mute testimony to this lucrative and risky enterprise in the South Atlantic during the early 20th century. During our three days here, as we walk beaches crammed with elephant and fur seals, we will observe the largest concentration of wildlife anywhere in the world. Finally, we reach the starkly beautiful Falkland Islands, with extensive populations of rockhopper, gentoo and Magellenic penguins as well as the regal black-browed albatross.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Antarctica, South Georgia and Falkland Islands expedition offers the experience of treading where no one may have been before as we land our Zodiacs on barren shores to observe masses of raucous penguins or colonies of albatross. For Antarcticans, history buffs, birders, photographers and lovers of wilderness areas this voyage should be one of life’s mandatory experiences. We hope you can join us!</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>29 January</FONT><BR>
Miami</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather this evening at the Miami International Airport for our flight to Santiago.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>30 January</FONT><BR>
Santiago, Chile</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrive Santiago early this morning and check-in to our hotel. Spend the rest of the day relaxing or sightseeing in Chile’s cosmopolitan capital city.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>31 January</FONT><BR>
Santiago / Port Stanley, Falkland Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly to Port Stanley and explore the charming town before embarking the World Discoverer. We set sail this evening for Antarctica.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>01 - 02 February</FONT><BR>
Drake Passage</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Named for the 16th century English seaman, Drake Passage is a deep waterway spanning 600 miles from the southern tip of South America to the South Shetland Islands. As we cruise this historic passage, our lecturers present fascinating discussions on birds and marine life. Strolling the decks, we have opportunities to see and photograph the wandering and black-browed albatrosses that wheel over the white-capped seas in company with sooty shearwaters and white-chinned petrels. We keep a lookout for the whales that are often seen in these waters.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>03 - 06 February</FONT><BR>
Antarctic Peninsula</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cruise the waters of the Antarctic Peninsula and its adjacent islands, making several landings each day. We plan to visit research stations and witness the scientific activities conducted by the multi-national community of scientists working there. Weather and ice conditions will determine our daily schedules. Though the expeditionary nature of our voyage precludes guaranteeing specific stops, the World Discoverer plans to visit the following places:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Deception Island</B> - As we approach Deception through Neptune’s Bellows, a channel just wide enough for our ship to navigate, the majestic albatross leave us and are replaced by flocks of southern fulmars and pintado petrels. Our anchorage is inside a volcano, whose collapsed cone was filled by rushing seawater. Brave souls may dip into the warm thermal waters near Pendulum Cove to experience swimming in the Antarctic! Weather permitting, we make a landing on the outside of the caldera at a colony of more than 100,000 nesting chinstrap penguins.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Torgersen and Anvers Islands</B> - Thousands of Ad&eacute;lie penguins, named for the wife of an early Antarctic explorer, greet us as we land on Torgersen Island. Just opposite Torgersen is Anvers Island, home of the U.S. Palmer Research Station. We go ashore to observe wildlife, returning to the ship as sunset glows from mountain peaks.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Lemaire Channel and Petermann Island </B>- Cruising the beautiful Lemaire Channel, we keep watch for the humpback and minke whales often spotted here. This narrow channel is one of the most spectacularly scenic areas of the Antarctic Peninsula. Steep mountain peaks jut up out of the sea on both sides and the waters surrounding our vessel are often choked with icebergs and frequented by crabeater seals. At the south end of the Channel, we stop at Petermann Island, where vistas of high mountains and glaciers provide a dramatic backdrop for colonies of blue-eyed shags, Gentoo and Ad&eacute;lie penguins.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Port Lockroy, Neumeyer Channel </B>- Large bleached whale bones attest to this anchorage’s whaling history. On a low-lying island in the bay, we can photograph gentoo penguins and blue-eyed shags, or enjoy the dramatic 360-degree panorama of alpine peaks. Crabeater and leopard seals dot the ice floes alongside our vessel.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Paradise Bay</B> - In our Zodiacs, we weave our way amongst fantastic icebergs, sculpted by wind and water, and approach the immense glaciers which rim this beautiful bay. Blue-eyed shags mingle with other seabirds as we go ashore and set foot on the Antarctic Continent. We can observe nesting gentoo penguins, or catch sight of a blubbery Weddell seal on shore.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Paulet Island / Antarctic Sound</B> - In an area of often heavy ice concentrations, Paulet Island sits at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and on the border of the Weddell Sea. Huge numbers of Ad&eacute;lie penguins as well as significant numbers of other breeding birds are found here. Remnants of the hut built during the Nordenskjold expedition is located nearby. The spectacular Antarctic Sound separates several offshore islands from the tip of the mainland. Numerous large tabular icebergs from the neighboring ice shelves provide fabulous scenery.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>07 February</FONT><BR>
Elephant Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrive this morning at Elephant Island, made famous by the survival saga of the Shackleton Expedition. Awesome glaciers, speckled with pink algae, create a dramatic backdrop. Weather permitting, we plan to make an expedition stop on the island.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>08 February</FONT><BR>
South Orkney Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mountainous islands were once known as &quot;The Inaccessible Islands.&quot; In winter, this group is actually joined to the Antarctic Peninsula, some 450 miles away, by a solid sheet of fast ice. Arriving on Laurie Island, we make our way up to the plateau of the island where a scene of unparalleled beauty awaits us. Once on the plateau, for as far as we can see, penguins everywhere!<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>09 February</FONT><BR>
South Scotia Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lecture series continues with presentations and informal discussions with our naturalists. They will recap our visits to Elephant Island and the South Orkneys, and introduce us to the South Georgia Islands.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>10 - 12 February</FONT><BR>
South Georgia Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility in this area is a must. All of our expedition leaders have been to South Georgia numerous times and, if the weather is in our favor, we may want to have a landing before breakfast or even after dinner. We’ll call at some of the many islands, bays and coves where outstanding birdlife and fur seals can be seen close at hand - a photographer’s paradise. The following is a list of places we plan to visit on South Georgia. Some of them are pending final government approval.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Elsehul Bay</B> - This beautiful bay on the north end is home to thousands of fur seals. Listen for the high-pitched trumpeting of the king penguins amid the magnificent sounds of marine mammals that echo throughout this bay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Right Whale Bay or Royal Bay</B> - Southern fur seals, elephant seals and king penguins, plus dozens of other bird species inhabit both these locations.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Salisbury Plain </B>- Thousands upon thousands of king penguins greet us, in every conceivable plumage. Lush and dense tussock grass provides habitat for the birds. Above the penguin rookery are two glaciers and rugged snow-capped ridges.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Albatross Island or Prion Island</B> - Located across the Bay of Isles from Salisbury, these islands have breath-taking scenery. We’re likely to find skuas and giant petrels nesting or wheeling overhead in great numbers. Fur seals abound. Wandering albatrosses nest atop the grassy hillsides, and a good hike up the ridge takes us closer to view these magnificent birds, whose enormous wingspan permits effortless soaring.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Stromness Bay</B> - Site of Shackleton’s arrival after a harrowing crossing of the island’s glaciers on foot, Stromness offers views of cliffs and a glacier, from which the adventurer and his companions descended. We’ll explore this historic bay by Zodiac, accompanied by the occasional blue petrel or light-mantled sooty albatross overhead.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Grytviken</B> - Our ship docks alongside an old whaling pier. Explore on foot, discovering old ruins of this once-active whaling station, now home to a small British military garrison. The cemetery holds a special fascination as it is here that Shackleton is buried - at the scene of his greatest triumph - on this island he loved. Seabirds, penguins and marine mammals can be seen while walking along the coast.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>13 - 14 February</FONT><BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lecturers recap our experiences at South Georgia Island. Join our marine biologist and ornithologist on deck in search of marine mammals and seabirds which flourish in these nutrient-rich waters.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>15 February</FONT><BR>
Sea Lion Island / Bleaker Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we will make stops on two islands off the south coast of East Falkland Island. Offshore Sea Lion Island provides a highlight of our Falklands visit - here we’ll visit a rockhopper penguin and king cormorant colony, in addition to gentoo and Magellanic penguins, plus communities of elephant seals and sea lions. With our naturalists, walk along the coast of Bleaker Island to a gentoo penguin colony and a large freshwater pond, where there is an excellent variety of Falklands waterfowl.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>16 February</FONT><BR>
Port Stanley, Falkland Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disembark the ship in the charming town of Port Stanley. Time to explore Stanley before we transfer to the airport for our flight to Santiago, connecting with our flight to Miami.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>17 February</FONT><BR>
Miami</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early morning arrival in Miami and connect to homeward flights.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>What to Expect<BR>
</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most activities a relatively low level of exertion is required. You will need to climb into and out of Zodiacs for excursions ashore; (there will be staff and crew members at hand to assist.) Ashore, you must be able to walk moderate distances over rough terrain (rocky, uneven beaches in the sub-Antarctic islands, and occasional ice and snow on the Antarctic Peninsula).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accommodations aboard the World Discoverer will be very comfortable and spacious. European chefs prepare a variety of international specialties.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperatures will range from 45&ordm;-55&ordm; in the sub-Antarctic region, and may get as cold as 30&ordm;-40&ordm; on the Antarctic Peninsula itself, although sunshine and low humidity will create a very temperate atmosphere.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will most enjoy the remarkable opportunities this expedition offers if they travel with a spirit of adventure. For more information please call Amy Shepherd at Zegrahm Expeditions (800) 628-8747 or (206) 285-4000.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Our Leaders <BR>
</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Michael Messick (Expedition Leader)</B> - A Galapagos family vacation almost 20 years ago inspired Mike to chart a course for adventure after college. He has visited more than 140 countries since. For the past eight years, Mike has been leading expeditions (many of them first-ever destinations), to Antarctica the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, the Arctic, Central and South America, the Amazon and Orinoco River, Madagascar, Japan, Indonesia, the South Pacific and Australia. A true sea-lover, Mike holds a U.S. Coast Guard Captain’s License, and has both Instructor and Divemaster certification from the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI). Mike is also a member of the prestigious Explorer’s Club. If you have not had the pleasure of traveling with Mike before, you will soon find out why he is considered by passengers and staff alike to be one of the best in the business.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Peter Harrison, MBE,</B> - A professional birder, artist, author, and screenwriter, Peter is widely considered the world’s foremost authority on seabirds. Often credited with having seen more seabirds than anyone, past or present, Peter has written and illustrated over a dozen books of which Seabirds: An Identification Guide is considered the bible of seabird identification. Whether on a ship at sea or strolling the beaches and forests onshore, Peter is not unlike the Pied Piper as passengers follow him, listening to his colorful dissertations on wildlife. Peter has led expeditions the world over and is noted for his quick-thinking and daring’s-do in tight situations. An active conservationist, Peter was recently invited by the Queen to Buckingham Palace to receive the prestigious award &quot;Member of the British Empire&quot; for Services to Natural History. Peter’s latest project is a 4-year contract as key consultant to the BBC’s latest and most ambitious natural history documentary production, an 8-part series entitled &quot;The Blue Planet.&quot;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Shirley Metz</B> is a modern-day adventurer and explorer. In 1989 she became the first woman and one of the first Americans in history to ski overland to the South Pole, a journey of over 800 miles! She is listed in the Guinness Book of Records and in 1989, the Soviet Minister of Polar Research and Exploration bestowed upon Shirley his country’s prestigious Polar Award, the only woman to have received this distinction. In addition to leading expeditions to the remote corners of the world with husband, Peter Harrison, Shirley films the wildlife of the areas they visit and maintains a stock library of footage which is used by production companies worldwide. She produces her own wildlife videos under the name of Eco-Productions. Because of her expeditionary expertise and training, Shirley supplies both logistical support and equipment to their film projects.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Carmen &amp; Conrad Field</B> - Naturalist’s Carmen and Conrad Field have been key members of a number of expedition teams aboard a variety of vessels to Antarctica, South Georgia and the Falkland Islands. 1996/1997 will be their eighth consecutive season in Antarctic waters. Carmen and Conrad have a gift for noticing and appreciating the minute details of life in Antarctica. In addition, they have the ability to not only share these discoveries with others, but also to explain the development processes and how they relate to the complexity of the Antarctic ecosystem. Their willingness to share their vast knowledge of the Antarctic history, as well as the natural history, will enhance both our shore excursions and our lecture series.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Richard Fagen</B> - A magna cum laude English major from Yale, with a M.A. in journalism and a Ph.D. degree in Political Science, Richard Fagen taught for 32 years at Stanford University. He is the author or editor of 16 books and dozens of scholarly articles. His most recent book is a novel, Closer to Houston, a political adventure set in Central America. A specialist in Latin America and American Foreign policy, Professor Fagen has taught in Mexico City and Santiago and served for two years as a resident consultant to the Ford Foundation in Chile. In 1981 he became the first holder of Stanford’s newly endowed Gildred Professorship of Latin American Studies. He has lectured on several World Discoverer expeditions including Antarctica, South Georgia and the Falkland Islands.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>TORRES DEL PAINE NATIONAL PARK</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><I>Optional Pre-Cruise Extension</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>January 23 - 31, 1998</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torres del Paine National Park, considered to be one of the most beautiful on the planet, was established in 1959 and exemplifies the indescribable scenery of Patagonia. It is over 615,000 acres in size and has justifiably been declared a World Bioshpere Reserve by UNESCO. Peaks of twisted granite in unusual shapes, dusted with snow, rise from the flat Patagonia plains. The three Towers of Paine dominate the scene with waterfalls, emerald lakes and verdant valleys.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 150 native animal species, which include over 100 species of birds, reside in the steppe and forested areas of the park. Flamingos move like pastel brush strokes against a canvas of sapphire, lapis lazuli and emerald colored lakes. Black-necked swans with necks that look like question marks glide gracefully by, while ebony-faced guanacos and their &quot;chulengo&quot; calves romp on the slopes beneath the Towers. Darwin rheas, the New World’s largest bird, race off in a high-stepping rumba and high, high above, South America’s aerial champion, the Andean condor, traces curves upon the wind.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by Zegrahm &amp; Eco Expedition leaders, we will have ample opportunity to observe the unique flora and fauna of this fascinating region. Together with the help of selected local guides they we will offer a wide range of activities. We will divide into smaller &quot;special interest&quot; groups of hikers, photographers, birders or those with a general interest in natural history. Depending on the weather, some excursions will be arranged by mini van to various locations within the park, or you can ride horseback, explore on foot, in a launch or on a mountain bike - always with the help of our expert leaders.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectacular Hotel Exploradores de la Patagonia is a study in refined elegance and the perfect counterpart to this primeval wilderness. Perched on the shores of Lake Pehoe, the view is spectacular with ample windows offering the imposing serenity of the Patagonian scenery. All of the furniture is hand made with a variety of the finest local woods. The Restaurant offers a blend of Mediterranean and traditional Chilean cuisine, and the Hotel also arranges picnic lunches and a superb Magellanic barbecue.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For outside recreation, there are open air jacuzzis, saunas, a swimming pool and a series of nature trails which provide hours of interesting exploration.</P>

When such tickets are used, you are generally bound by the terms of these tickets with respect to your legal relationship to the owners and operators of the ship, their agents (ZOE), and the ship’s crew.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On advancement of deposit to ZOE the depositor acknowledges that he/she has read and understands the above recited terms and conditions, and agrees to be bound by them.</P>
