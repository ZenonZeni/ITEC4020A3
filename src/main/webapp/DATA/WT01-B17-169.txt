<b><font size="+1">SALES OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS GROW</font></b><br>
<b>Consumers Want Natural Medicines </b><p>
A new survey by Whole Foods magazine indicates that 1995 sales of vitamins, dietary supplements, herbs, and homeopathic products grew by 19.6% over 1994 for nearly 70% of U.S. retailers. These four categories represent, on average, 64% of a natural retailer’s sales. Among vitamins, multiple vitamin and mineral formulas represent 30% of sales, single vitamins 20%, led by vitamin C (33%), followed by vitamin E (20%), and B complex (18%), reports Whole Foods.<p>
Among the most promising of new supplements expected to soar in sales were melatonin, antioxidants, shark cartilage, and green foods. Pycnogenol, cat’s claw, and glucosamine sulfate, tied with vitamin E. Product categories that showed the most sales growth in 1995 over 1994 included homeopathic remedies (85%), specialty supplements and herbs (44%), single vitamins (28%), sports nutrition formulas (25%), and single minerals (19%). Speciality supplements include antioxidants, stress formulas, weight-loss aids, green concentrates (e.g., spirulina, chlorella, wheat grass), and probiotics (“friendly” bacteria for the intestines).<p>

<b>U.S. Cardiologists Displeased </b><p>
American cardiologists hold “highly negative attitudes” toward the FDA and its regulatory policies, according to a poll of 216 cardiologists and cardiac surgeons conducted in 1996 by the Competitive Enterprise Institute of Washington, D.C. About 94% of the cardiologists were  men and 56% have been practicing for more than 15 years.<p>
In the survey, a majority (57%) said that FDA’s long approval process for new drugs results in patient deaths, 46% contend FDA regulations prevent physicians from using promising new drugs or medical devices, and 65% believe the FDA acts too slowly in approving new drugs. Of considerable interest is the opinion of 63% of cardiologists that the general public does not understand the “human cost” in suffering and lost lives caused by FDA regulations. <p>
According to 60% of cardiologists polled, the FDA’s policy of limiting information about off-label, “unapproved” uses  for drugs and devices, makes it more difficult for them to learn about them. When asked if the FDA’s approval process has hurt their ability to treat patients with the “best possible care,” 71% said yes. <p>
Finally, 53% favor FDA reform so that unapproved drugs can be used by physicians, and 47% said the most important criterion informing their decision to use an unapproved substance would be persuasive published research; only 25% said FDA approval or product use in other countries would be good enough. “Something is wrong when an agency charged with protecting public health is viewed this negatively by physicians fighting for their patients’ lives,” said Sam Kazman for the Institute.<p>

<b><font size="+1">THE FINANCIAL POLITICS OF MAMMOGRAMS</font></b><br>
<b>The Results Don’t Support the Expense</b><p>
Current research within conventional medicine itself provides 4 strong reasons why the unquestioned popularity and use of mammogram screening for detection of breast cancer ought to be reconsidered.<p>
First, mammograms are costly (from $50-$200) and have a low accuracy rate for early detection of breast cancer, according to The Lancet (July 1995). The article states that breast cancer screening via mammography for women under 50 years old is inappropriate, and goes on to say that, in general, “The benefit is marginal, the harm caused is substantial, and the costs incurred are enormous, [so] we suggest that public funding for breast cancer screening in any age group is not justifiable.”<p>
Second, since mammographic screening was introduced in 1983, the incidence of a form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which represents 12% of all breast cancer cases, has increased by 328%, and 200% of this increase is due to the use of mammography. <p>
For women under 50, the increase in DCIS diagnoses rose 4000% during this same period. About 97% of women with DCIS are treated with surgery or radiation despite the fact that physicians do not know whether either treatment actually extends lives at all, according to The Journal of the American Medical Association (March 27, 1996). Physicians conducting the study admitted there is an urgent need to reevaluate the appropriateness of these treatment options.<p>
Third, mammography’s false-positives waste money. A Swedish study of 60,000 women, aged 40-64, who were screened for breast cancer revealed that of the 726 actually referred to oncologists for treatment, 70% were found to be cancer free. For women under 50, the number of false positives for breast cancer was 86% of those referred for more testing. In addition to the needless anxiety produced, the clinical follow-up for false positives accounted for almost 33% of the total cost of the entire screening program, according to the British Medical Journal (February 1996). <p>
Fourth, estrogen therapy confuses mammogram results. According to a study of 8,800 postmenopausal women, aged 50 and older, the use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) leads to a 71% increased likelihood of receiving a false-positive result on mammogram screening, according to Mary B. Laya, M.D., M.P.H., study leader at the University of Washington at Seattle, who published the results in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1996. <p>
Dr. Laya also found that women on ERT were more likely to get false-negative readings. In summary, faulty mammogram results endanger health, exact a heavy emotional toll, and can lead to expensive and unnecesssary tests.<p>

<b><font size="+1">LETTING THE REAL PROS HANDLE HEALTH CARE</font></b><br>
<b>Medical Racketeering Gets Organized </b><p>
Many critics of the conventional medical establishment in the U.S. have likened it to organized crime and racketeering for the way huge profits are skimmed off at taxpayers’ expense, but now evidence has emerged in New Jersey indicating the Mafia is actually in on the profits of America’s $1 trillion healthcare honeypot.<p>
According to  Peter G. Verniero, New Jersey Attorney General, authorities “smashed a ring” of at least 12 individuals with known Mafia family connections. The ring was involved in siphoning off money and filing fraudulent medical claims in union-sponsored healthcare plans covering one million patients. The company in question was Tri-Con Associates which arranged and managed medical, dental, and optical group plans for employers and unions. <p>
“We hope it’s not a national trend, but we cannot dismiss that possibility,” Verniero commented. His investigators stated that the U.S. healthcare industry is “a potential treasure trove for mobsters” to use personal information from insurance programs to blackmail and extort patients and providers. Somehow Mob involvment in U.S. healthcare seems in keeping with the prevailing spirit of the conventional medical establishment.<p>

<b><font size="+1">THE DRUGS AND TESTS MAY NOT BE NEEDED</font></b><br>
<b>But the Profits Are Hard to Resist</b><p>
<b>ANTIBIOTICS.</b><br> 
Antibiotics are never warranted in cases of acute bronchitis, according to doctors in The Lancet (March 1995). Seven double-blind trials show no major clinical benefit to taking antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis, yet 50-70% of patients with this condition are still being given antibiotics, as doctors continue to prescribe them at an “alarming” rate. 
Further, a study of 1439 Medicaid patients who consulted doctors for colds revealed that 60% received prescriptions for antibiotics even though only 2% actually had secondary acute sinusitis or ear infection that would indicate the need for such drugs. Otherwise, antibiotics for colds (or acute nasopharyngitis) are considered ineffective, reports The Journal of Family Practice (1996). This use of ineffective antibiotics adds an estimated $37.5 million to the annual cost of U.S. health care and it might contribute to the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria, the researchers said.<p>
<b>LASER SURGERY.</b><br>
Since the introduction of laparoscopic (laser) surgery, the number of gallbladder operations on people 65 years and older has increased by 22%, despite the fact that 67% of these surgical patients suffered only from uncomplicated gallstone disease, which does not normally require surgery, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, May 1995. At the same time, malpractice suits for bile duct injuries during gallbladder removal have risen by 500% since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery.<p>
<b>HEART TESTS.</b><br>
Researchers at the Maine Medical Center found that the number of bypass surgeries and angioplasties performed in a region of the U.S. depends entirely upon the amount of diagnostic testing of patients, but not necessarily upon actual medical need, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (April 17, 1996). The researchers estimated that 80% of all heart testing procedures are inappropriate and that 50% of all bypass operations in the U.S. are unnecessary. The total 1993 cost for Medicare billings for diagnosis and treatment of heart disease was $1 billion.<p>

<b><font size="+1">LETTING AIR OUT OF THE MEDICAL BLOAT</font></b><br>
<b>Earnings Drop for Physicians</b><p>
A small decline in the earnings of conventional physicians in 1995 may indicate larger changes to come in the financial bloat known as U.S. health care. According to a poll of 4,000 physicians, the average physician’s income dropped by 4% in 1995 from 1994, and for the specialist (surgeon, psychiatrist, gynecologist), the drop was 5.3%. <p>
The decline would seem paltry except for the facts that it is the first income reduction since 1982 and that, for the last 12 years, physicians’ incomes have risen 6% yearly. The reversal is due mostly to the rapid growth of managed-care insurance plans and their tendency to squeeze out excessive spending, said researchers in Health Affairs (September 1996), the journal that published the report. It may finally indicate that some of the bloat is being let out of U.S. health care. <p>

<b><font size="+1">DON’T EXPECT THE MEDICAL TRUTH ON ER</font></b><p>
According to a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine, television’s portrayal of emergency allopathic medicine may glamorize the treatments at the sacrifice of accuracy. <p>
The researchers analyzed 97 episodes of ER, Chicago Hope, and Rescue 911, highly popular television shows that constantly portray heroic chest thumping and last-minute cardiac resuscitations of dying patients by presumably skilled doctors and nurses; ER alone has an estimated 35 million viewers. <p>
However, the researchers found that at least 60 of these episodes that presented “seemingly authentic detail” actually quite misrepresented emergency room realities. On TV, only 17% of those receiving CPR are elderly, yet in “real life,” the majority of cases are old people; on TV, about 75% of cases requiring CPR derived from accidents, in real life 75%-95% are caused by underlying heart disease; and while 66% of CPR patients on TV survive, the reality is more like 7%-15%. <p>
The “real life” version of CPR is gruesome, violent, undignified, and sometimes causes broken bones, the researchers noted. Television’s glamorized version of amazing medical successes succeeds only in fabricating an illusory picture of allopathic competence. While it may be a fabrication, it is fabulous propaganda for conventional medicine. <p>
