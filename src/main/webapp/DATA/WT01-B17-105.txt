<H3>ENDING THE MONOPOLY
-Major Congressional </H3>
Support for Alternative Medicine on the Docket
Alternative medicine is poised for major Congressional support this year as Senator
Tom Daschle and U.S. Representative Peter deFazio (with 18 Congressional co-sponsors)
introduce their Access to Medical Treatment Act in both Houses of Congress.
&quot;Conventional medical treatments have monopolized the market and shut out
complementary and alternative treatments,&quot; state Barton and deFazio. 

<P>The intent of the bill is &quot;to expand the selection of medical treatments available
for illness and to give many patients another option when conventional methods fail.&quot;
The bill would guarantee the right of every person to receive any medical treatment
desired, including those not approved, certified, or licensed by the FDA, providing
this treatment is administered by a state-licensed health care professional. If
passed, this bill could profoundly open up the medical marketplace for the legal and
unharassed use of alternative medicine. &quot;I want to get the thousand-pound gorilla
known as the FDA off the backs of people who want access to beneficial health
treatments without compromising the public's safety,&quot; states DeFazio.
<P>

<H3>ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAKES DRAMATIC GAINS AT THE STATE LEVEL</H3>
One key to making alternative medicine universally available in the U.S. (and
reimbursable by insurance companies) is a change in the licensing laws at the state
level. This year New Hampshire became the tenth state to license naturopathy, thanks
to unflagging grassroots work. The news from Oregon is similarly encouraging for a
nationwide shift in licensing. There, on May 30 this year, the Oregon House of
Representatives passed the &quot;Alternative Medicine Bill&quot; which will make this state the
sixth in the U.S. to provide legal protection for patients seeking or doctors
providing &quot;unconventional&quot; treatments or drugless therapies. According to lobbyists
who worked for this bill, it was &quot;the energy and the power from the many citizens,
physicians, patients, and their families&quot; that guaranteed the passage of the bill. On
July 28, an extraordinary grassroots campaign managed to persuade legislators to
overturn the Governor's veto of this bill, thus ending 20 years of consistent
persecution and prosecution of licensed physicians who practiced alternative
medicine. This is an exceptionally important development, with favorable import for
the future of alternative medicine in the U.S.

<P>The Massachusetts legislature is now looking over a Medical Freedom of Choice Act
that would prevent government authorities from interfering with &quot;duly qualified
practitioners&quot; simply because they are using unconventional practices or products.

<H3>INSURANCE MONEY TALKS-The Nation's 
First Alternative Health Plan</H3>
Citizens for Health, a national health advocacy group based in Tacoma, Washington,
has teamed up with the Alternative Health Group of Thousand Oaks, California, to
provide a progressive health coverage plan for alternative treatments. The plan
covers conventional and alternative therapies, including, for example, acupuncture,
ayurvedic, chelation, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbs, nutrition, and others, in all
50 states. Not only is this plan a welcome relief to highly restrictive conventional
insurance plans, but it may exert financial leverage to mobilize legislative change
at the state and national levels. That's because alternative medicine is probably
more cost-effective than conventional and can save insurance companies a great deal
of money. They in turn can help change the structure of American health care to favor
alternative medicine.

<H3>&quot;QUACKBUSTERS&quot; BUSTED</H3>
All 190 charges against Lawrence Taylor, M.D., a California physician practicing
chelation therapy, have been dropped. Dr. Taylor had been the subject of a concerted
$750,000 harassment campaign by conventional medical authorities that included the
Office of the City Attorney (San Diego), the California Medical Board, and the
pseudo-science sham &quot;quackbuster&quot; front called the National Council Against Health
Fraud. All this despite the lack of formal patient complaints against Dr. Taylor. 

<P>Too bad they wasted all that money on a futile cause. How much more a benefit to
society the money would have been if these misguided medical &quot;authorities&quot; had
instead financed further research into the health advantages of chelation therapy. An
effort by the California Medical Board to outlaw chelation therapy in that state
(despite prodigious scientific research validating its claims) also nosedived into
nonresults, no doubt further exasperating the ill-advised opponents of alternative
medicine.

<H3>U.S. CONGRESS BARKING AT THE HEELS OF AN OUT-OF-CONTROL FDA-Threatens to Defund
&amp; Micromanage the Agency</H3>
Congressional investigation of inappropriate or unlawful activities by the FDA,
called the &quot;Foot-Dragging and Alibi Administration&quot; by Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), who
is leading the charge, are intensifying as the year proceeds. At issue are the FDA's
rampant intimidation of practitioners, their Gestapo-style clinic raids, their
tardiness in approving new medical devices, and their heavy-handed tactics against
unconventional physicians, all of which eliminate patient access and medical freedom.

<P>In Barton's view, the FDA is &quot;uncooperative&quot; in answering Congressional inquiries; at
least seven of their regulatory programs are now &quot;targets for defunding;&quot; and if they
keep on &quot;subverting the intention of Congress&quot; that will leave &quot;no alternative but to
be micro-managed to ensure that they live up to their legal requirements.&quot; One
powerful way to snap the FDA back into line is to simply, and literally, cut off
their tax-payer-supplied money.

<P>The fact that FDA is trying to railroad new rules to keep the names of people who
make unfavorable reports on devices, products, and doctors confidential is not likely
to win Congressional favor. That's because this rule would enable FDA to use bogus,
unreliable, or unsubstantiated adverse reports as the basis of regulatory actions
without having to disclose these for public inspection or challenge. It could give
the &quot;quackbusters&quot; yet another unfair edge against alternative medicine.

<HR><A NAME="HOMEO"> </A>
<H3>HOMEOPATHY WORKS! Admits Prestigious 
Scientific Journal</H3> 
A landmark study in the British medical journal, Lancet, convincingly shows that
homeopathy is indeed credible, dispelling the lame criticism by skeptics of
homeopathy that its healing effects are more imaginary than substantial.

<P>Researchers worked with a group of 28 patients who suffered from allergic asthma.
They gave 14 patients a placebo while the other 14 received a homeopathic remedy
specific for allergies. None of the 28 people (or the researchers) knew whether they
had the real remedy or the placebo.  One month later, when homeopaths and
conventional doctors examined all 28 patients,  they found that those who had the
homeopathic remedy showed a marked improvement in their symptoms compared to the
placebo group.

<A NAME="hay"> </A>
<P>This study came on the heels of two earlier, highly favorable studies involving the
use of homeopathic remedies for hay fever sufferers. Taking the results of all 3
studies together, researchers concluded that patients using homeopathic remedies had
a 33% reduction in symptoms compared to only 10% with placebo.  A 1991 study in the
British Medical Journal showed that  out of 107 clinical trials for homeopathy, 77%
showed positive outcomes for illnesses such as influenza, migraines, and rheumatoid
arthritis.

<P>Meanwhile, it's encouraging to learn that about 20% of pharmacists nationwide are now
regularly directing their patients to over-the-counter homeopathic remedies on the
average of 6 times a month. Further, the World Health Organization states that
homeopathy is the second most widely used form of medicine in the world, second to
Chinese medicine; herbalism is third and conventional medicine is fourth.

<H3>DOUBT IS THEIR 
PRODUCT-When Science Becomes Public Relations</H3>
One of the prime reasons that our protracted war on cancer has turned into an
unwinnable &quot;medical Vietnam,&quot; says Robert N. Proctor, History of Science professor at
Pennsylvania State University, is that cancer research and the reporting of its
results has become a predominantly political issue. And when you link politics with
medicine, you suddenly enter a perilously gray territory in which truth recedes and
special interests rush to the forefront. 

<P>As an estimated 538,000 Americans now die of cancer every year, a &quot;cure&quot; grows ever
more remote and even clarity about prevention gets increasingly obscured by the
financial interests of the conventional medical establishment. You have &quot;islands of
agreement separated by deep seas of controversy,&quot; writes Proctor. Cancer research is
big business and unless you are a discriminating, resourceful reader, most likely you
have been subjected to the clever, often deceitful, promotional efforts of corporate
trade association &quot;science.&quot; In 1986, at least 1700 associations spent $2 billion on
&quot;issues management, advocacy, communication, and image advertising&quot;-on
smokescreens, in other words, but not the bare truth. 

<P>Trade associations (notably tobacco, petrochemical, and asbestos) adeptly combine
research and advocacy-sometimes as only &quot;a mixture of scientific fact and
fiction,&quot; says Proctor-to produce a culture of doubt and uncertainty in which
they are carefully insulated from charges of bias or legal liability. In this
ambiguous  new world of propaganda, manipulation, and public opinion shaping,
&quot;rhetorical strategies of avoidance&quot; reign supreme. 

<P>In Proctor's view, &quot;all [associations]  share a desire to absolve their constituent
client substances...of blame for an alleged nuisance&quot;-especially if it's a
cancer cause. If suspected cancer causes are in doubt, from conflicting studies or
inconclusive results, this becomes the perfect excuse, if you're a regulatory body,
for doing nothing to change it.

<BR>Special Report
<BR>
BAY AREA BIG ON ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, 
<BR>Says New Poll</CENTER></H3>
Of people living in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, 41% tried alternative
medicine at least once last year, according to a new poll of 600 adults conducted in
April 1995. This is far above the national average of 34%, which surprised many when
first cited in 1993 (based on 1990 figures). Most popular among the disciplines
consulted are herbs and vitamins, relaxation techniques, massage, chiropractic, and
macrobiotics. Interest in acupuncture is soaring in California, with 4500  licensed
practitioners, or one half of the nation's total, at work in this state.

<P>Of those who tried alternative medicine, 54% said they were &quot;very satisfied&quot;  and 80%
said they would do it again; 51% said they were &quot;likely to try&quot; alternative
treatments soon. More women than men made those office visits, yet 51% of both sexes
said they were favorably considering making an appointment. Why is alternative
medicine's popularity growing so rapidly? Because it works, is affordable, and
doesn't fill your life with side effects.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Drug Industry-
<BR>America's Nonstop Profit Center</CENTER></H2> 
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Why The Club, or organized conventional (allopathic) medicine, wants to maximize profits and minimize 
information, regardless of what patients want.</CENTER></H3>

In case you're wondering what is driving U.S. annual health care costs over the
unbelievable $1 trillion mark, take a look at recent drug industry statistics to see
a major contributing factor. 

<P>According to information reported in 1993, drug prices outside the U.S. were 10%-70%
lower than those charged in America; prescription drug prices rose about three times 
higher than inflation between 1980-1990 as drug makers boasted annual profits 3 times
higher than the national average for Fortune 500 companies. Further, drug companies
spend about $13,000 per U.S. physician in marketing, about 22% of their total sales
(about $75.2 billion worldwide) on promotion, and $231 million to develop and patent
a single drug.

<P>It's not as if the exceptionally high drug profits are making life any easier for the
sick. Patients pay exorbitantly for these &quot;modern medical miracles.&quot; For example: a
diabetic woman's monthly drug cost is $150; a heart transplant patient shells out $50
a day for antirejection pills; a Gaucher's disease patient needs $270,000 a year to
pay for his drugs. Herbs are mostly unpatentable and thus unprofitable, so it's
easier for drug companies to suppress rather than support them. That's what keeps
&quot;The Club,&quot; or the organized conventional medicine establishment, highly profitable,
says medical researcher and activist  Michael L. Culbert, D.Sc.

<P>&quot;While the American expression of the Drug Trust is the focus...the international
nature of the pharmaceutical octopus cannot be 
overlooked,&quot; writes Culbert, &quot;for it has played a role, both openly and behind the
scenes, not only in  endlessly producing toxic synthetic compounds for human
consumption, but in helping bar the development, use and distribution of natural
therapies at every turn.&quot;
