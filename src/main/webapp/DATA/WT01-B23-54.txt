<h1>CHAPTER V. ADULT FELONY MARIJUANA DISPOSITIONS</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The following graph clearly shows the buildup of marijuana
cases in California's superior and lower Courts until 1977, when
the Moscone Act, in tandem with Penal Code Section 17, and PC
1000, took marijuana possession dispositions out of the court
system. </p>

<p>This part of our report is far from complete. The Bureau of
Criminal Statistics has provided us with adult felony marijuana
disposition data for the years 1976 to 1984, which is presented
here. 'There is no data available on adult misdemeanor
dispositions, and the juvenile disposition data is limited. </p>

<p>The adult felony marijuana dispositions are collected by a
system known as OBTS-- the Offender Based Transaction Statistics
program, which has been on line in California since 1978. Before
that, the information is less than complete because some counties
weren't using OBTS yet. </p>

<p>Even the OBTS data, however, is thought to be about 30 percent
underreported. This applies to all adult felony dispositions
including those for felony marijuana offenders. Despite this, it
is possible to calculate the costs of these dispositions by using
the percentage of all dispositions which were for marijuana
instead of the raw figures themselves. </p>

<p>The other figures needed for this calculation are Accurate,
across the board Court expenditures including direct trial costs
and other court related expenditures. Only the California
Judicial Council collects this information in combined form, and
that has only been in the last few years. We have used this
information to determine an approximate court-cost per adult
felony marijuana disposition for fiscal years 1982/83 and
1983/84. </p>

<p>The data collected by the Bureau of Criminal Statistics
divides these expenditures into Court costs (for Superior,
Municipal, and Justice courts) and &quot;Court-Related
Costs&quot; which are not divided by court. This makes it hard to
assign court-related costs to superior or lower court, and we're
still reforming on a method by which to do this. Then we will be
able to ascertain total Court expenditures on marijuana
dispositions for other years. </p>

<p>In the DISPTREE charts on the -following three pages, the
-figures used determine court costs are those in lines 8 and 39,
because those are the dispositions that made it into a court.
Line 1, the total adult felony marijuana dispositions, includes
those released by the police (line 2), those that were turned
over to another jurisdiction (line 3), those on whom a complaint
was requested by a prosecutor (line 4), and those whose complaint
was denied by a Court (line 5). </p>

<p>Since only those on whom a complaint was filed (line 6) made
it into courts it is accurate to use only the actual court
dispositions (lines 8 and 39) in computing Court Costs. However,
this does not include the costs of police dispositions,
prosecutors, or public de-fenders. </p>

<p>Actual court expenditures on adult felony marijuana
dispositions were approximately 16.4 million dollars in fiscal
1992/83, and approximately $18.6 million in fiscal 1983/84. This
works out to a Superior Court cost of $2112 per marijuana case, a
Lower Court cost of $1491 per marijuana case, and a combined
average cost of $1701 per marijuana case. </p>

<p>Inflation-adjusted expenditures have -riot been calculated
yet. </p>

<p>334) COSTS OF ADULT FELONY MARIJUANA ARREST DISPOSITIONS,
1983-84 </p>

<p>The method used to calculate the costs of marijuana
dispositions relies on the time-weighting technique which the
Judicial Council of California uses to determine the number- of
judgeships needed in the state (Source la). This technique
recognizes the wide variance in judicial time needed to dispose
of different types of cases, and gives a much more accurate
picture of court dispositions than would be obtained from using
the raw numbers of dispositions. </p>

<p>In fiscal 1983/84, for example, there were 781,471 cases filed
in superior court. Of these, only about IC) percent (74,412) were
criminal cases. However, these criminal cases tool, up 33
per-cent of superior court time. For comparison juvenile
delinquency cases were also about IC) percent of filings, but
took up only 7 percent of superior court time because most were
sent to juvenile court (Source la!, pp. 105, 114). </p>

<p>With this in mind, the costs of felony marijuana dispositions
can be worked out by ascertaining the costs of criminal cases in
superior and lower courts, and then multiplying the result by the
percentage of those cases which were for marijuana. </p>

<p>The figures for court expenditures in fiscal 1982/83 and
1983/849 and the percentage of time spent on criminal cases, come
-from the annual reports of the California Judicial Council
(Source 1). However, the Council does not have specific
information on the number of marijuana dispositions processed
through the courts, and for this we must rely on Bureau of
Criminal Statistics data (Sources 2 and 3). </p>

<p>BCS can provide information on adult felony marijuana
dispositions back to 1976, and for comparability we will
therefore use BCS data on total adult felony arrest dispositions.
However, due to underreporting of disposition information to BCS,
only about 70 percent of adult felony dispositions are recorded
each year (Sources 2 and 3). And this does not include any adult
misdemeanor dispositions or juvenile dispositions. </p>

<p>Thus, we are comparing expenditures that are 100 percent
reported with dispositions that are only 70 percent reported. The
difficulty is mitigated somewhat by the fact that the percentages
of total adult felony dispositions which were for marijuana
(lines 6, 14 and 20 in the tables) would remain approximately the
same if the disposition information was reported 100 percent.
Since the calculation of marijuana expenditures relies on these
percentages rather than on the raw number of dispositions, the
result should be as accurate as possible with available
information. </p>

<p>In the lower courts, the categories of criminal cases which
include marijuana offenses are felony preliminary hearings,
felonies reduced to misdemeanors, and Group A misdemeanors. These
are the criminal cases used to determine the percentages of
Municipal court time in line 10. Justice Court percentages are
unavailable; by using Municipal Court percentages we have in
effect transferred the relatively few marijuana cases in Justice
Court into Municipal Court. </p>
