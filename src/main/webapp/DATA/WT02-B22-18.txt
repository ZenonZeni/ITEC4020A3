<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>it's great!! If it wasn't for adult chat lines, I never would have met my boyfriend (Who's great in bed and very good looking by the way)
<LI>not enough
<LI>diapers are great :) I would have had seriusly psychic problems without the supprt of the Adult/Baby Infantilism community on the net.
<LI>disappointing
<LI>wonderful
<LI>Interesting.
<LI>should be taken off
<LI>It gives me a hard-on!!!
<LI>i think it is interesting
<LI>great!
<LI>it´s wery fun and interesting
<LI>it is pointless
<LI>I think it's great,and I would like to know how to get conneted with more of it. It has opened my mind.
<LI>It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside...and out!!!!
<LI>everybody wants money. I might as well go buy a magazine
<LI>CAN INDULGE A FANTASY OF PEDOPHELIA, NEVER APPROACH CHILD
<LI>I haven't really found what I'm looking for.
<LI>boring
<LI>Absolutely the best thing that ever happened to the PC
<LI>ponography is in the eyes of the beholder.if you don't like,don't watch
<LI>I t is the greatest hting ever
<LI>it's COOL but i can't find animal sex pictures :(
<LI>I think adults should be able to do what they want on the Internet; however, children should be supervised by a parent when they have access to this type of materia......everyone should not be punished!
<LI>Educating
<LI>Pedophilia and bestiality should be removed; sites rated; parents responsible.  ISPs should be able to limit access to triple-X sites/newsgroups for specific accounts.
<LI>I think it's great, but some of the links are misleading because you don't find sex on them.  Also, sometimes you can get some good ideas.
<LI>I think it is interesting I learn things every day
<LI>It is very good.
<LI>found my husband on the Net.......sex is great!!!
<LI>Some of it is pretty sleazy but the net is a fabulous medium, underutilized for the promotion of healthy sexual attitudes.
<LI>I believe that sex on the internet should not be regulated.  I is a good source for some people to let out their sexual expressions.
<LI>i think people should have free access to it
<LI>It costs money for the real good ones
<LI>the more the merrier
<LI>Sex on the Internet is why I bought a modem!
<LI>I think that the internet is a cool place to find information on things, talk about things,or expierence things you wonder about.
<LI>As long as it is not hard core pornography, I don't see anything wrong with it.
<LI>I think that sex on-line is a option for sex in real life, and with all those STDs out there, sex on the Net should be promoted
<LI>I hate censorship. First they censor sex, they tell you what you can and can't see, next they tell you what you can say and not. And don't give me the "it's to protect the children"-crap. If you have children, look after them, talk to them. Don't try to educate someone else his children.
<LI>It's not for kids...Netscape & others could build in a "blocking" switch.  Adult providers don't want kids and would gladly insert code to correspond with blocker switch code.
<LI>Not a bad thing. it is a little educational.  Anonymous mailing programs promote people to say and do thing that the normally would not.
<LI>I think it's very disturbing that people turn to computers for sexual outlet when there are so many other ways to do it.  cum on the keyboard is a pretty gross idea but it happens.  there is no absolute way to stop kids from seeing it--my little siblings 
<LI>Sex on the Internet--it's better than sex with my wife.  She cut me down to once a month for sex.  I'm lucky, though--I know two guys she cut out altogether.  I'll tell you, strange things happen around my house. The other night I came home from work and found a guy jogging naked in front of my house.  I asked him how come.  He said, "Because you came home early!"  I said to him, "Who told you you could fool around with my wife?"  He said, "Everybody!"  Sex, sex, sex.  I remember the first time I ever 
ad sex--boy, was I scared.  I was all alone!  But getting back to your question--sex on the Internet?  I think I prefer sex in bed, thank you very much.
<LI>Its great to view pictures of hot chicks, but I would like to see more wild stuff
<LI>It is real opened-minded
<LI>i like it
<LI>Enjoy it.
<LI>Great lunch time entertainment
<LI>It's a new way of exploring one of the most natural aspects of human life.
<LI>I suppose it can be fun for whoever likes it
<LI>It's freedom of speech - it's up to parents to control it
<LI>it is cheap
<LI>I think it is a good idea
<LI>sex and the internet is fantastic. I wish it were easier to get to the good stuff!
<LI>I like it alot 'cause I don't get it no where else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>futuristic, not real
<LI>Amusing for those who can't get it elsewhere.
<LI>I think that it is great that I can have acess to all of thi and more naked maless great matieral. I just wish that more of it was free.
<LI>faddish
<LI>So far I have'nt found it offensive, but it could very easily become offensive.
<LI>If you don't like it -- quite simple don't tune into it!
<LI>not enough porn relating to fellatio wich i love to give
<LI>Sex is human nature and there is no need to stop the development of Internet.
<LI>It is great.
<LI>It's fun to access
<LI>Part of life.  Pervertyed for some, normal for the vast majority
<LI>Not all that connected!
<LI>No wonder there's so many perverts out there! Instead of being an intimate act between husband and wife, it seems that everything and anything is a go-ahead. One day, God's gonna get all perverts, just like he did with Sodom and Gomorrah!
<LI>Good forum where people can interact freely and openly
<LI>Answer to 16.  Sexual material is very easy to find.
<LI>There is noting wrong with sex on the internet. Even if sexual matterial were banned from the internet that still doesn't help solved any of the problem that we are currently facing.
<LI>I think anything should be allowed on the internet
<LI>I am glad that the Internet and Usenet are open areas of discussion.  My girlfriend and I wouldn't have met and we wouldn't have been able to develop as healthy a relationship without an open area to talk and question.
<LI>fun
<LI>those who think sex and the internet should be regulated should look at our constitution and our freedom of speech, the internet is just a new way of transfering information, there should not be any regulation on it whatsoever because what you find on it is what you are specifically looking for and nobody's fault but your own.
<LI>I WANT TO FUCK EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!!
<LI>just came online today. kinda hard to find.
<LI>Keep up the good work!  Hopefully there will be some strange stuff to come.  
<LI>cool eh
<LI>I said it all already
<LI>I feel that other medie such as the internet to obtain sexual information is great as long as parents do realize that older kids (starting at age 5 or 6) can and will find out how to use the internet to find the sex stuff. Everyone with children should buy the parental block software.  I have a month old girl, and when she gets older I will install blockers on my system.
<LI>I Love it !!!!
<LI>Information wants to be free! Sex must go on!
<LI>I think it's great, it's simply fun to read and view the sexual stories and photos on the net.
<LI>It's better than being repressed.
<LI>Sex is normal, it should be open for anybody.
<LI>I think there should be more communication between potential partners
<LI>I wish it were organized better.
<LI>do it do it do it if you are of age
<LI>great
<LI>It's not a problem.  I personaly like it.
<LI>How different is it from Compu$erve and AOL, REALLY?
<LI>MORE OF IT AND MAKE IT EASIER TO ACCESS AND DN LOAD
<LI>i THINK IT IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS YOU NORMALLY WOULD FEE UNCOMFRTABLE ASKING IN PUBLIC.
<LI>It shouldn't be regulated. Parents should be responsible enough to purchase proper software and not put the burden of "baby sitting" their children on the rest of society.
<LI>Its Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
<LI>It's there.
<LI>looking forward to exploring
<LI>Its great
<LI>nothing
<LI>NO CENSORSHIP !
<LI>Sex is cool.... and so is the internet... together they are pretty cool.
<LI>People should have the right to do what they please...  censor yourselves, not others
<LI>I really have found sexual material on the net, but then again I haven't been looking for it.
<LI>It's not near as big a deal as the media's made it out to be.  In the end, parents, and not the government, need to do the babysitting.
<LI>SEX:I like it, I want it, I need it!  
<LI>Sex on the Internet should be treated no differently than any other subject.  The beauty of the net is the lack of censorship. Just like television, it IS the responsibility of Parents to censor what their young children view.  Blaming others for porno, rebellionism, or whatever on the Net is blatant immaturity.  Parents should be parenting (I am a parent, so I feel as though I have the right to say that) 
<LI>show me your pussy!!
<LI>Sex is the ultimate entertainment, always has been, always will be.  Why should the net be any different.  Phone sex, adult movies on cable and nudie mags are all allowed, why victimize net users?
<LI>Lets all get off!
<LI>It is interesting to see what is avalilble on the net.  I have become more open to other people's sexual orientations.  I think for people my age sex on the net is a good thing.
<LI>I enjoy it although I understand the need for some control over what can be viewed by whom.  When I have children I wouldn't want them to be able to find this stuff so easily.
<LI>Entertaining
<LI>Very few sources which portray sex as a beautiful and personal act between two people in love 
<LI>I LOVE IT! 
<LI>Thanks for presenting material that is not cencsored!
<LI>seems to be a lot of fun... ;-)
<LI>Internet sex sucks because I'm wacking off to a bunch of fat whores and little kids.  
<LI>it"s pretty cool.
<LI>I still cant find a homepage on body hair, my preference !
<LI>I want to see more...it is a little hard to find anything really good
<LI>Porn is very hard to find on the net : all is soft !
<LI>I love it
<LI>I think it's empowering for people to see that they have peers.  The net provides that.  Keep it that way.
<LI>I enjoy having access whenever I feel the need
<LI>It opened up my eyes to what is out there and has helped me to better understand it.
<LI>should have more access to hard core porn 
<LI>cool
<LI>I think for older people it is fine but I do not think it is appropriate for children.
<LI>I believet that censorship of anykind should be discouraged.  I monitor my kids and they know that if they get into an area that is off limits, they leave.
<LI>Interesting
<LI>still looking
<LI>All the best sites require you to send money
<LI>`i think that sex sites on the net are harmless, and should be available to anyone who wants them.
<LI>Uhh...It rules.
<LI>Its great!
<LI>its actually very stimulating adult entertainment
<LI>N/A
<LI>very cool 
<LI>paid site everywhere
<LI>I think that kids learn lots about it on the net. I like to look and listen but it's harmless. I think it's a great learning exspience.
<LI>I find that it is an outlet for me and opens me to different types of sex and helps in my marrage as far as our sex lives.
<LI>I wish it were easier to access.  It is a good vent for frustration and boredom.  Let's face it, SEX is fun.  Why not be honest with human nature and teach respect instead of repression.
<LI>It blows my mind .
<LI>I like it, I don't think it should be banned, but you must take responsibility for your own actions!
<LI>remarkable
<LI>none
<LI>I am offended that the US government thinks it has a right to limit my access to ANY kind of information.
<LI>it is the best thing this century!
<LI>I like it
<LI>Crazy Brazilian Boy
<LI>more more more but filter it from kids
<LI>I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT VERY MUCH BUT I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN
<LI>I have not looked for it that much and am a new user. Maybe will reply again later with a more precise feeling. But initial reaction I don't see the problems that all have been talking about.
<LI>I love it
<LI>its interesting
<LI>Satisfied a great deal of my curiosity - ironically, I've lost interest in many things - becoming more "normal".  Go figure!
<LI>I like to use the internet as a source for sexually explicit material
<LI>pity we are sitting in a library
<LI>Reflects the values of its users
<LI>I think is a great place to increase knowledge without embarrassing.
<LI>I think in terms of regulating sexual content on the net - there is a very thin line between censorship and regulation; I think it's up to parents to monitor what their kids are exploring through the internet.  I enjoy exploring the different sexual arenas available on the 'net.  I think it's scary that governmental agencies are trying to control what information is available online.
<LI>go v-chip!
<LI>it O.K
<LI>It's all a bit hyped up really
<LI>very cool!
<LI>great
<LI>There should be more
<LI>We like it!
<LI>very erm?... explcite- if you know where to look
<LI>its briliant.. i love it.
<LI>It's pretty imformative
<LI>I think it's terrific!
<LI>boring
<LI>Everything should be open to children. 
<LI>Cool
<LI>People need to become open minded somehow.  Maybe this is they way.  If you don't like it, you don't have to see it.  It's a choice that should be kept open.
<LI>it's great
<LI>BORING!! There is nothing too tell. What I've seen is webpages set up like Playboy magazines, and after age 16 that shit is tired.
<LI>cool
<LI>I love it, wish I could find more.
<LI>I think it is a good thing, to get people aware of what sex really is.
<LI>There should be more hard core stuff available.
<LI>great
<LI>Ain't nothing like the real thing.
<LI>fascinating
<LI>i think its a great way to finding info on subjects that turn you on. and to connect with others that have the same interest
<LI>People seem to spend too much time having this 'virtual' sex stuff.  I don't see the point.  
<LI>more pictures
<LI>Nothing wrong with it.  I do believe there should be some sort of security measures taken so children are not able to access certain areas.  As far as how to accomplish that, I don't have a clue.
<LI>it should be available for consenting adults. if people dont want to see it they don,t have to, but they do not have the right to dictate my morals
<LI>The time has come for people to manage their own sexual activities and desires(in the privacy of their homes) without being shamed  or belittled...I am talking about adults ,children have fewer rights,you can't child proof the world..that is why they invented parents...Keep up the good work
<LI>I was so so.
<LI>I don't think there should be any censorship of sex on the net.
<LI>It is a-okay.
<LI>It is good, as long as at stays out of childrens hands
<LI>great
<LI>I think it's great
<LI>It's Great
<LI>I think that sex on the internet can be very enlightening, interesting and fun.
<LI>I wish I knew where to find it and it could be downloaded quickly.
<LI>I think that it's not abig part of the internet, but it is there
<LI>It's there because people want it. 
<LI>keep it going until I find the real stuff.
<LI>I am new to the internet, but so far it has been difficult to find sex on the net.  I think I will have to try it out before I can give an honest answer.
<LI>havn't found it yet
<LI>IT IS GREAT!!! CUM<CUM<CUM!!!
<LI>Keep up the good work
<LI>sex belongs to every aspect of live
<LI>No comment at this time.
<LI>There are many people who have nothing better to do than to push their will upon others. Freedom of choice is still the best thing about being American, or sentient, for that matter.
<LI>too open, need id system???
<LI>I think it is great that people are so open . But they probably short our many a keyboard. ;)
<LI>Fuckin' awesome!!!!!
<LI>I think it is fabulous
<LI>just one more piece of information in the jungle
<LI>I THINK IT IS GREAT AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED
<LI>The Net sholuld be completely open.  Information is information and should not in any way be restricted.
<LI>There is nothing wrong with it.  
<LI>It sucks because you have to pay for everything
<LI>LET IT STAY.... The Internet should be a place without rules.. If you are smart enough to use the internet then you have the right to do what you please without the pigs getting into your business
<LI>Basically I have found it to be very mild and inoffensive.
<LI>Good adult entertainment of kind.
<LI>There isn't really a whole lot going on I Feel.
<LI>wish people were more mature about it.
<LI>Certainly cheaper and closer than adult newsstands, but, like them, gets boring fast.
<LI>I think the availability of this kind of material on the net is itself not a bad case, though it should be handled in a responsible way.
<LI>I don't believe in censorship, bur I do believe that it is the responsibility of the parents/ responsible parties (Teacher, administrator, etc) whoever it is that is giving the child access to the internet, to monitor and restrict access to innapropriate material.
<LI>I think it should stay and be accesible 100% of the time.
<LI>i want sex, hard sex
<LI>not much
<LI>a kind of relaxsation,  take out our stress
<LI>Sex in the internet is okay, you can learn about different lifestyles and explore about yourself more
<LI>sex is great and so is the net
<LI>I want more....more.....more sex on the Internet
<LI>Leave the Net be. It's the last stronghold of True Freedom in this world. If people want Sex they're going to find it no matter what ie. magazines, movies etc
<LI>I think they're letting it get out of control to quickly. A rating system would appear to be a must.
<LI>I like to read the sex articles
<LI>I think it's great. STD's aren't an issue. Life is too short anyway for "the gift" that keeps on giving...HIV... thanks. .
<LI>Sex=Sex; Internet=Internet
<LI>It's my choice and I want to keep it that way.
<LI>Gives one an outlet to find out things regarding weird subjects. ie Foot Fetishism
<LI>I tink it is great for releasing sexual frustration!! Keep it up!!!
<LI>I have only been on for 2 days and i intend to fully explore
<LI>Great!
<LI>I am new here
<LI>Interesting and educational
<LI>The internet is a fantastic place to fantasize and engage in totally safe sex.
<LI>no problem
<LI>i love sex
<LI>I wish there was a way to keep kids from it.
<LI>I like it. It's like having sex without actually dong it.
<LI>Let People do what they want. Don't fuck with our rites!!
<LI>No Comment :->
<LI>I would like to get access to more of it
<LI>It serves as the physical needs satisfyer to the human being
<LI>This Is Good Shit
<LI>it's the best I know
<LI>there is not that much.  there should be more
<LI>I think it is our right to do,say whatever we want!!!
<LI>lotta talk little action
<LI>Sex is already shoved aside in society the net lets it out
<LI>I really like the idea. It is harmless and fun
<LI>It has enabled me to explore my sexuality safely, wisely, and affordably.
<LI>it can be good and bad at the same time..but depending on your purpose what do you want from it!!
<LI>People want government to take responsibility for raising everyone's kids, except their own.
<LI>I THINK IT'S GREAT,THERE SHOULD BE MORE VEDIOS.I'M NEW AT THIS.
<LI>People do on the Internet what they really want to do deep inside but they never would do off the computer.
<LI>I like what I see on the net, however I am concerned about confedentiality, especially since I am not the only one who has access to my computer. I am worried about someone stumbling onto to something that I don't want them seeing. Other than that I think sex on the net is great.
<LI>I think there should be more chat places
<LI>Haven't really thought too much about it...
<LI>from what I've seen, it's more hype and advertising than anything else.
<LI>Keep up the good work
<LI>I want more
<LI>it burns up alot of time
<LI>Not enought
<LI>its good
<LI>very interesting and could be educational
<LI>love sex, love the internet, people should use them to stay happy and healthy
<LI>If a person want it and they are of age, if its on the internet it can be available to them.
<LI>Complete Freedom is Needed.
<LI>cannot find what I am looking for
<LI>It's great
<LI>Lots of hot and horny pictures
<LI>I enjoy sexual material on the internet because it allows privacy. I am a happily married man, but I am curious about bisexual relations. The internet allows me to fantasize privately and view material which could be embarrassing to purchase at a video/ma
<LI>It's there, but you have to look for it.  IE Erotica is not thrown at the user, and it takes effort to find it.  But it's easy to find.
<LI>It's fine. I like it
<LI>boring
<LI>More More More!
<LI>Absolutely fabulous.
<LI>Informative!!!
<LI>Fuckin' Hard to find
<LI>It's okay
<LI>Good idea!
<LI>I think sex on the internet is cool, as long as you don't just get off on your hand.Geta girl
<LI>Grrrrrrrrrrrrreat!!
<LI>I find all aspects of the available information to be interesting.  I will continue to visit the NET and learn more.  Thanks for giving me a chance to say my two cents.
<LI>I am a sexual person and the NET offers a variety of subgects. Although I have had great dfficulties in accessing much of the sexual sites, and hate having to pay to see pictures and stuff.
<LI>A cultural treasure
<LI>I view some pornographic material on the internet.  However, I do not believe that it is healthy.  It definitely is not necessary.
<LI>not enought
<LI>sex material
<LI>love it
<LI>Sex (in all it's forms) is a natural act.  One based on trust, openness and sharing.  Personally I would perfer to see violence and commercialism controller on the net. 
<LI>I think the services that help people with their questions are great.  Even things like the dirty jokes and R rated stuff don't bother me, but the XXX stuff must be stopped for the sake of the kids.
<LI>it must be intertaining; no bestiality's, no kid's porno
<LI>it must be intertaining; no bestiality's, no kid's porno
<LI>this is quite fun and i like it
<LI>Best shit aroung.  It was through the Net that I found another Hermephradite to have sex with.  We sucked each other, and also fucked each other's asses and pussies.  It was great
<LI>I luv it
<LI>like it
<LI>I don't like those sites that say "sex here" and then there is nothing
<LI>i would like to see it easery to talk to people about sex
<LI>To each his own...If you want it, you go there...if not stay out...
<LI>I don't go looking for sex/porn on the net, but if I run into it, I might check it out.
<LI>Dandy.
<LI>its really not that bad, people make more out of it than what is really there
<LI>I believe that the internet is a wonderful way for people to express themselves.  I think it is also a great learning tool, and it lets us explore our interests, and broaden our horizons.
<LI>Wonderous.
<LI>fun to look at, but the real thing is so much better
<LI>It's good. I've had fun with it like sex is supposed to be.
<LI>I'm not opposed to it, and I look at some pictures once in a while, but I think that there is a bit too much of it on the'net.
<LI>need more FREE pornography
<LI>Sex on the Internet has made me very open-minded.  I know the truth of some misconceptions about sex, disease, and sexuality. I have learned more about myself.
<LI>love it
<LI>I think it's great. If people are worried about seeing "controversial material" on the net then I feel they shouldn't look for it. It's a free country and people should be able to access what they want.
<LI>i feel that there is much more talk about it than really appears on the net.  most  interesting things require membership or a fee.
<LI>Sex is the beginning of and a part of life.  The Internet is a new culture which is also a part of life.  Violence is more damaging than sex!  Ban Violence from TV, if you think something needs to be banned.
<LI>It is a fantastic vehical of self exploration- It must not be govornment regulated
<LI>Everyone does it, why not talk about it. However, children do not have sex and should not have access to sexual material such as pornography. More and more this society needs an uncensored uncorporate influenced media such as the internet offers -- true democracy!
<LI>I think it should be at the descretion of the user weather he or she wishes to connect to a sex site or not.
<LI>It's Private and my business and it hurts no one includeing me 
<LI>I love it! I'm always horny and ready to have sex. Anywhere.
<LI>I think its what we want and each person should decide
<LI>Sex is the most basic thing in all our lives.  It will be on the "net" and anywhere else people congregate.  Censorship, in any form, is dangerous. Open, honest, presentations of all forms of sexuality should be MORE available to everyone if social stigmas are ever to be exposed for what they really are--a means of propagandic mind-control to force people into tired stereotypes favored by facist conservatives.
<LI>I love it,it fun 
<LI>IT rocks!!!!
<LI>I find sex and the Internet go well together. Sex is a good thing and should not be hidden.
<LI>i can be fun, but step to keep out of little hands should be taken
<LI>Since I'm curious about bi-sexuality, it gives me a chance to find out what I like about wemon, and if really makes me "Bi-sexual".
<LI>I think that it is great, I have learned a lot about that people's interests from other parts of world are no different than anyone else's
<LI>Think it"s fun if kept in prospective.
<LI>I think it is an exercise of are rights to gain access to sex on the net.
<LI>It's overrated. Folks are too obsessed with it. The net provides a forum for _antbody_ to post any type of perverted material and be assured of a potential readership in the millions. 
<LI>give me more!
<LI>it's great
<LI>its great!
<LI>it's good
<LI>Interesting and educational
<LI>It's great of you're in the mood; if not, it is still tolerable.  It is a wonderful form of free expression!!!
<LI>Do not let the government mess with it
<LI>I like it, you can learn what you need to know with out beeing embarrased
<LI>No problem with it.
<LI>I like jizzing on the keyboard.
<LI>The issue of porn on the 'net is highly exaggerated.  If parents don't want their kids to access "porn," they can always unplug the computer!
<LI>sex: don't know, haven't tried yet.internet: cool.both:ok
<LI>Who jerks off at work? Not I!
<LI>stupid
<LI>Sex is cool.
<LI>It's alright with me
<LI>It's fun but can become obsessive.
<LI>Too much, and in the same time too little. It's hard to find what you search for.
<LI>Have not found very much so am not qualified to say.
<LI>Like anything else, it is capitalistic
<LI>I think if an adult is curious about this area of the internet, that it is a very good source.  It is also very helpful for self-help subject matter.  The only thing I do not like is that child pornography(from what I understand) is on this and that it is
<LI>I like it.  I dont think child porn should be allowed. but other than that, its like everything else, it harms just as much as it helps.
<LI>I like it. Most of the free stuff is pretty tame (Playboy, Penthouse) and the really raunchy stuff appears to be mostly pay-for-service. I don't subscribe to any paid services, and my kids can't get into those areas, even if they knew how.  Besides, the process of searching for "bad pictures" is a GREAT way to hone your searching skills, and become more computer-literate. I'm sure that kids will do this (after all, I did), but what they're likely to find is no worse than I'm sure they've seen from frie
ds at school.
<LI>i think that as long as you are very dicreet about what you bring up in publicc it is o.k. Parents should monitor their own children at home but a comittee should appeal to the public on what is moral and what is not, than take it from there. surveys are a good idea
<LI>I think that it is informative 
<LI>Anarchy prevails--long live anarchy!
<LI>all sex
<LI>it's not good enough... links say "free pics here!" and I'm lucky to find a single lady with her bikini off... that kind of sucks and if links are going to advertise "100s of free pics" then that's what should be whether the surfer is a member of the link
<LI>It's ok for adults, but it's too easy for children to access!!!
<LI>overrated
<LI>i love it.  everbody should look at at and read the material and none of it should be censored
<LI>I think it's too easy to run into, when you're not looking for it. Like, I searched "Toys" and the second reference was for sex toys. I wanted to look at kids toys. I figure so do most kids. So what's up with that? A rating system is a good idea, coupled with parental supervision.
<LI>much ado abount very little. . .those who would ban what little there is. . .get a life!
<LI>sucks
<LI>it is harmless
<LI>i don't know
<LI>I like it it is safe and know one needsto know you are on
<LI>it's ok
<LI>It sure can waste alot of our/my time, but sometimes informative.
<LI>Aside from personal curiosity and interest, it has helped with my research paper on bisexuality.
<LI>good
<LI>Gay links are hard to find!!!!!!!
<LI>It is great.
<LI>n/a
<LI>if you type sex in a search it returns every home page
<LI>its awesome
<LI>i wish my parts matched!!!
<LI>its awesome
<LI>its fine, the parents should be responsible for their children and all hard core porn cost money (credit card) anyway.
<LI>I believe that it should be available due to the fact that it will promote safer sex, and masturbation if you will by providing erotic material to all those that just can't get none.  :)
<LI>Fascinating...
<LI>I really try not to think about it:)
<LI>its cool 
<LI>as a mature adult i like to be able to view what i want, sex or anything else.
<LI>I hate paying for it. FREE PORN!
<LI>get rid of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<LI>IT KICKS ASS (but it isnt as good as the real thing) sincerley Jerrin "Wesley" Frabrello I Like Boys girls are o k but Jacking off with wesson ismy favorte
<LI>cool
<LI>i have been trying to find pictures to download and I can't.  I'm 22 years old and want to get aroused..  I
<LI>anonominity of the net promotes honesty 
<LI>I LIKE IT.
<LI>to tell the absolute truth, I haven't really seen any at all and I woulb be really curious to see what all the hype is about.
<LI>Most sexual sites on the internet are expenseive or just cost for something that is  supposed to be open
<LI>It is not as heavy as it would be, I thought I would be impressed, but didn't happened that way
<LI>I think it's very good that there is sex on the internet because it gives people anonymity so they can feel comfortable to say or do what they want while on the net.
<LI>I think it should be easy to be accessed because marriages can be saved by steamy, sexual pictures.
<LI>I thinks it fine just as long as its rated and maybe some sort of clearance code needed to access the material.
<LI>It's ok
<LI>It's cool as long as the Children do not get into the areas
<LI>If someone doesnt like it they dont have to read it.
<LI>i think it's arousing and fun
<LI>i think it's arousing and fun
<LI>Sex and the Internet go well together...
<LI>Very interested to get into IRC and e-mail domination
<LI>Can be a useful source of information and exchange, as well as an avenue for the more inhibited to act out their fantasies, in the private/comfort of their own environment, without posing a threat to anyone.  You can always logoff if disinterested.
<LI>I THINK YOU CAN FIND SEX ON THE INTERNET IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE.
<LI>Sex on the Internet is something that everyone should have access to.  Anyone getting on line knows that these areas are available.  If it offends one, one simply stay away from the sites!!
<LI>I like it.
<LI>I particularly dont care about it but some people want it let them have it.
<LI>very interesating
<LI>Sex on the internet opens people's minds to new and different ideas.
<LI>People who don't like the fact that sex is on the net should simply not access that material.  To each his own.
<LI>Love them both!
<LI>People who don't like the fact that sex is on the net should simply not access that material.  To each his own.
<LI>it should be real.
<LI>I have never encountered 'sex' on the internet, though I have sought it out.  Nudity is easily accessed and I feel that nudity should not be censored.  Keep in mind that sex is the only way that the species survives and at one point or another, almost everyone engages in sexual intercourse.
<LI>Lousy
<LI>i think that it's interesting to have access to this stuff.
<LI>I think it's great, there should be more!
<LI>k-r4d
<LI>It's okay. I'd like to see more harder-core type stuff.
<LI>Need more ads.
<LI>I think the Internet is not so attractive without Sex.
<LI>could be better organized
<LI> i think it's a good safe otlet for sexual relations
<LI>As a matter of fact,I have not found any "real" pornography on the "net"! But if I should find any "porno",on the "net", it's no one else's "business"!
<LI>its great
<LI>I believe it is opening up new areas of sexual expression, and that is a good thing.
<LI>i LIKE IT
<LI>You can't stop people from talking about sex, either appropriately or inappropriately.  But I think that sites that have pornography and sexually explicit material should have a page that warns users before entering.  Also, I think that these sites should voluntarily put some sort of switch or HTML code on the warning page that when recognized by a browser will not permit the user to enter that area if the user or the parent had that option checked on their browser or security program preferences. Pers
nally, the internet would be better if there was no pornography on it, but I guess that there's always going to be perverted people out there.
<LI>I think sex on the net is very stimulating.
<LI>I haven't real tried anything yet, just seen some pictures that's all.
<LI>Keep it up, er, I mean good job.
<LI>it's a turn on
<LI>Its OK
<LI>It's only a curiosity right now
<LI>wHERE DO i FIND IT?
<LI>I think sex is unavoidable.  Computers are a way of life for most people .  If this is going to remain so, censorship is obsolete.
<LI>I belive in freedom; if you don't dont look.
<LI>It's been a new and exciting experience that both my wife and I enjoy.
<LI>It's a psychological and socialogical revolution.
<LI>more,more,more,
<LI>Its ok with me
<LI>I don't think that there are enough places on the net that specifically deal with fettishes that I have, pedophilia for example.
<LI>uncertain
<LI>I think it's a good way tolearn more about especially reading other peoples experiences.
<LI>digital sex?  boring.
<LI>I' a virgin on net
<LI>As an adult, I love it. 
<LI>boring commercial
<LI>I think that sex on the net is great.  And it is everywhere!
<LI>i like it
<LI>If you like sex then the Internet is one area amongst many that are available. There are minority groups, individuals and governments who feel it is there right to interfere in the lives of others, the net to a small degree helps to curb their interference.
<LI>GREATTTT!
<LI>Nice way to find new things...
<LI>IT'S O.K
<LI>Its ok
<LI>I don't forsee any problems with it
<LI>I think that is very healthy & brings out open-minded feeling
<LI>The internet is for everybody and must not be censored
<LI>No Comment
<LI>I think it's stimulating, interesting, and fun for adults to be able to interact in an open forum.
<LI>I personally do not want my childern to be able to have access to this on the internet but I want them to surf and learn maybe freedom has to given up for the greater good of society/everyone is looking for one special thing to keep sacred that is what keeps us going for me it is a purpose have people stop degredating other people if people had more respect for others who knows what would happen maybe utopia
<LI>its the best thing since penthouse
<LI>We like it a lot!!
<LI>I hope more open-net.
<LI>Great !!!
<LI>Why not? We all like it or life wouldn't exist on the planet.
<LI>A fun and safe way to fulfill some interesting needs
<LI>I believe that the internet is like a TV, if you do not like what you see, turn it off!
<LI>if it is pormoting safe sex then I am for it, but if the perverts that I read about in the papers have acess to children then it is going to far.
<LI>I've seen some very degrading images and statements on the internet regarding sexuality and women. However, I do not believe that the internet should be regulated by the government, for the government would commercialize the internet, and promote a milder form of oppresion of women. The need some groups and individuals feel to denegrate the sex act, and especially the place of women in that act, smacks of fear and self hatred. It is unfortunate that they get the reinforcement they are looking for on th
 internet, be it positive or negative.
<LI>Its there if you want it
<LI>I think it's easy to access commercial sites of pornography rather than get a private honest talk to someone of your age. I'd like to find more people to talk to.
<LI>Keep it up everyone, support voluntary rating scheme
<LI>IT'S FINE
<LI>I've just seen Webs such as Playboy or Penthouse, nothing else really interesting
<LI>It's nice that you have it and it has helped me through times 
<LI>Internet is a good way for adults to explore sexuality, and I think that sex on the net is OK, and just about as available as i t should be.
<LI>it helps me find new ways to pleasure
<LI>I feel that only parents of children should have the final word on home net-use.  If a provider says no to porn, then you still have the option to goto another provider. As for kidie porn, I have no idea how that should be handeld I think it is just harmful to kids
<LI>LOVE TO SEE MOVING PICTURES RATHER THAN PHOTOS ONLY.
<LI>it's alluring, but you can't really get anything!!!
<LI>it's good
<LI>should be more ways to find it
<LI>Sex on the internet is like sex in life, it's everywhere if you want it to be.  We are all in control of what we do or don't see.
<LI>WAnt lots more of it
<LI>not interested
<LI>it's a good outlet for adults, but not minors
<LI>open and creates a the loss of innocence
<LI>big deal.  the government needs to keep their nose out of it.  if these groups want some type of control, let the parents have it.
<LI>It's novelty.  It's all a joke.
<LI>SEX,SEX,SEX,SEX,SEX,SEX I WANT SSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEXXXXXXXXXX
<LI>It's gives the new meaning too life in the sex lane.
<LI>New to the internet-not enough information yet to have a worthwhile opinion
<LI>Thank God!
<LI>As a new user, I wanted to see how easy it was to to access pornography - real simple, just type anthing remotely close in the net search box and you are there.  Also, inappropriate conversations in almost every newsgroup to "stumble on to."  I watch my 11 year old closely.
<LI>i love it
<LI>Hm... nothing really. It's been fun so far, though.
<LI>free minded
<LI>I have nothing against sex on the net. I occasionally read alt.sex.stories, and have engaged in cybersex a fe times, but thats about it. As a 16 yr old, I htink that its normal to have some curiosity, and the net has helped fulfil some of that curiosity.
<LI>i have yet to see anyinternet sex...very easy on AOL
<LI>it's grown alot since the net first gained popularity
<LI>I have not had much experience with the internet.  I am not really sure yet what the internet has to offer.
<LI>uncontrolable
<LI>I fuck the monitor!!! The mouse strokes the prick.
<LI>No real opinion, I get bored from time to time, so I browse and I'm not dissapointed when I find it.
<LI>i don't believe in any form of censorship, but regulation?...  children need to not have access, etc.
<LI>it is one way to conveniently view sexual material
<LI>Its wonderful
<LI>Access to the masses and the sex drive being second most important only to eating to avoid starvation in humans, is anyone really surprised that sex is so popular on the Internet? Think about it, instead of having to buy a porn magazine at a store and risk someone you know seeing you or going to an x-rated theater sitting in God knows what to watch a porn movie, people can now get this on the web in the privacy of their own setting of choice. It's kind of like porn videos becoming available for home re
tal. 
<LI>Nothing that you havn't seen or heard of before!!!
<LI>It is cool and interesting trying to find it but at the same time I am morally opposed to it and afraid that the children seeing this will be injured for life.
<LI>I think that it is fun and gets people to let out their inner hibititions out..
<LI>i think that it's o.k.
<LI>live and let live, if you want to pull up pornography it is the individuals choice.
<LI>It is no big deal
<LI>It's OK, fun to read but there are lots of really, I mean really sick people out there. I hope the things that they write about are fantasys and not real life.
<LI>Just another vehicle for entertainment/expression
<LI>it's great!
<LI>not enough clean hot naked women, too many ugly girls
<LI>The more sex, and the more openness, the better.
<LI>just like everything else, it's there, so what?
<LI>I can watch you masterbate through your computer screen!
<LI>Boring
<LI>I'm pretty new to the net, so maybe I should keep looking, but it seems to me that there isn't a whole lot of really good, juicy, information sources about sex on the net, mostly alls I see is porn, which can be informative and educational in itself, but sometimes I'd like to learn something, instead of just just jerking off.
<LI>it's another topic that can be found on it;  if people are interested in it,  then they have the option of choosing it;  essentially it's on the net because an interest is shown for its availability.
<LI>It's what everybody is looking for so it should not be restricted too much.
<LI>It is disillusional.
<LI>I think it is a great thing, you can other people just like you through the identity of the computer and later decide if you want to lose your identity and come in contact with a certain person.
<LI>Just new to the net, but I am searching for more info and details
<LI>Yawn!
<LI>I like sex in general.  My favorite thing to do is use a dildo while looking at pictures.  I sometimes speak French because I am the French teacher at PPHS. 
<LI>More hipe than anything.
<LI>I want it all the time
<LI>I don't think the net needs policing action.  Sexual curiosity is natural and healthy. It's better than pemiscous (sp?).
<LI>GRRREEEAAAAAT!!!!!!
<LI>sqish sqish mmmm
<LI>It's cool!!!
<LI>Love it!
<LI>it´s wonderful
<LI>i think it is a ver good place for people to meet other 
<LI>More sex on the internet please!!!
<LI>Explicit and sometimes extreme even for the open minded. It possibly gives vent to the repressed needs of a society that needs an outlet.  Rather have the repressed getting off on the 'net' rather than through criminal expression.
<LI>You won't see anything shocking unless you're looking for it
<LI>I'm exploring; I'll tell you if I have any.
<LI>What Ihave found has been great. I get a thrill out of finding sexual information by typing in certain key words. i believe there should be a book with all of the information's locations.
<LI>not enough
<LI>puritanic
<LI>Some regular information is needed for sex in Internet
<LI>only one part of a vast amount of interesting material
<LI>I wish there was more
<LI>It's a-ok and extremely entertaining.
<LI>wank wank wank wank wank SPLUT
<LI>It is not everywhere like the media likes us to believe.
<LI>i love sex,
<LI>ITS HORNY
<LI>Not a problem.  
<LI>Don't really know enough to answer.
<LI>I will looking for the erotic pictures and sex stories
<LI>i wish there was more!!!!!
<LI>I think it's healthy to a great extent. Government doesn't belong as a moral policeman. Individual control at the micro (PC) level (parental or otherwise) is a better solution than Government telling me something is morally degrading .
<LI>Its silly. WHats the difference other than the children in the net and the sex shops and strip joints etc?
<LI>should be more    activities
<LI>back in my day we didn't have things like this to make people look at sexuality as a form of porn.  It was a bond between a married man and woman.  The world would be better if people went back to that way of life.
<LI>I think that SEX on the INTERNET is an outstanding forum for those who want and respect it .
<LI>There is not enough access to hard core stuff.  It's a lot of wasted space and stupiid links to other links to about 50 sites that really have pictures
<LI>I wish I knew how to find more of it. (Gay related things)
<LI>Since surfing the Internet is very much a one-person activity, it is ironic that sex has flourished so enthusiastically.  I'm sure masturbation is riding an all-time high in popularity.
<LI>a great opportunity for one to express their really sexual feelings in the privace of their home.
<LI>Censorship is wrong
<LI>I believe that it is a safe way of venting sexual frustration.  I also think that there should be more sites on the net available for free.
<LI>it allows for indiviuals to see what is out there and to ask questions and hopely find a correct answer to their questions.
<LI>The internet provides a unique outlet for many people to express themselves in a safe and open manner. As a learning tool there can be no match.
<LI>watching people masterbate
<LI>It's a new form of safe sex. Prevent the kids form seeing it, but don't take it wawy.
<LI>Answer to #17 resumes all.
<LI>I think that sex is a great way to have fun an experiment in different ways.  As for it being on the internet,I see no problem with it at all.
<LI>great.
<LI>A cheap thrill!

<LI>no government intervention--user can choose not to
<LI>Not a damn thing
<LI>if you donot like it donot look at it
<LI>if you don't like it, you don't have to view it!
<LI>Parent key lock on rated sites
<LI>There are other channel that sex can be access through. I think that internet is just a part of a problem, if there is one, but not the major part of the problem.
<LI>there should be an ID number that you had to submit that simply showed you were of a legal age to view certain topics, it had no other function, certainly not discrimination or censorship
<LI>sex on the net is for losers
<LI>create blocks
<LI>parents should regulate their own children.
<LI>Build net interface systems with censor programs that either censor recognized words (user-specified words or pre-programmed lists) or do not connect with sites that contain said words.
<LI>An established "Internet Police" find the jackasses that give the net a bad name
<LI>If it is OK on phone lines, its OK on the net!
<LI>Get a life buddy!  Ya gotta love it!
<LI>if you do not like it do not access it
<LI>password sites
<LI>Let private industry provide for the needs of the conservative.
<LI>some sort of parental lock
<LI>illegal: bestiality, kiddie-porn, violence should be gone
<LI>allow free market to "create" products to allow a parent regulate usage
<LI>Action against the Net based on pornographic and terrorist activities is much more about political power and the preservation of the status quo.
<LI>provide free filters to prohibit child access
<LI>find out their religous views and then we can see where they're coming from.
<LI>tell people to shut the fuck up and if they don't like the sexuality of some URLs, don't go to them.
<LI>You should be able to "lock out" undesirable sites by ratings.
<LI>Parents should be responcible for their kids..I damn sure am!
<LI>providers should be required to screen, on request by the individual customer
<LI>Parachuttes are like minds they only function when open!!!(:
<LI>personnell software restrictions
<LI>Have a content rating encoded into HTML Programming and have a programmable content configuration option included in future versions of Netscape, and other popular browsers. In this way, adults, and parents could set a rating level within their viewer that would automatically monitor and restrict the viewing of HTML files that exceeded the pre-configured rating level.
<LI>no governmental or corporate control
<LI>let it be
<LI>Each user should be responsible for ensuring that Minors and those offended should not have access
<LI>This Is Good Shit
<LI>open but protected to people 18 or over
<LI>However, parents should be responsible for keeping very explicit material away from their kids
<LI>the more the pictures the better
<LI>What subjects you explore on the net is personal. People should be permitted to view and discuss any and all subjects. If something is not to your liking, don't view it!
<LI>should be monitored by yourself at home.
<LI>personal censorship programs
<LI>Parents should be the ones to censor their children
<LI>Install parental lockout capability
<LI>Have warnings
<LI>If they don't like it, why are they looking?
<LI>don't let the kids seen a sex picture
<LI>If they don't want to see don't look
<LI>Fuck them.  They are fucking losers.  I     would like to fuck their noses and come on their brains.
<LI>establish universal site locator for adult sites.  These could be used by parents to limit access by children
<LI>Make it easier to block the things you don't want.
<LI>No censhorship mof any kind on the net !
<LI>Sex for all: everywhere  anyti
<LI>kill the fascists
<LI>comletley open
<LI>offer these people a way to block sex sites, like call block through the telephone company
<LI>people have to make up their own minds.  
<LI>tell them to turn it off
<LI>Allow parents to regulate use by children.  Post warnings on explicit material
<LI>LET PARENTS DEAL WITH THERI KIDS, NOT MY PROBLEM
<LI>fuck them all damn it!!!!
<LI>retail "sex-safe" software browsers
<LI>If you are interested you should have the chance to use it.unsure
<LI>enforce US laws where site is located, then make *sure* all other sexuality is restricted to legal, choosing adults.  (more than "go away if you're too young" messages.  Offensive advertising outside of this area should be removed.
<LI>Self Regulation by site ops
<LI>I feel the only way to reulate the net is on a hosehold bases, parents being in charge. If parents don't fell the need to monitor the kids that is their busness and still legal responibilty
<LI>users must have a code to acsess
<LI>let the parents deal with it.
<LI>It's up to parental guidance.
<LI>who cares
<LI>Some sorce for "locking" kids out of certain areas
<LI>Nothing done at all at any level. 
<LI>with the freedom of speech, comes the freedom not to listen.
<LI>put porn everywhere
<LI>These newfangled contraptions will be the downfall of us all!!!
<LI>Create private software to censor material for super anal-retentives to install and repress only themselves.
<LI>should be open to small children He.He.He
<LI>more sex on the net
<LI>Promte software censor agents that become part of the service providers provision of products.
<LI>leave it up
<LI>I feel the Net should be open w/individual control
