FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT

The UK Securities and Investments Board (SIB), under its chairman,
Andrew Large, is entering a new phase in its attempt to police London's
financial markets.

The SIB's early years were mainly taken up with detailed rule-setting;
subsequently there was a shift away from detailed rules in favour of
broader principles which the self-regulating organizations (SROs) could
then apply; and now, following some spectacular financial scandals, the
emphasis is on enforcement.

The background to this problem is the fragmentation of responsibility
for tackling market abuse. The multifinance enforcement agencies
involved include the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury,
the Crown Prosecution Service, the Services Fraud Office, the
Securities and Futures Authority, the Stock Exchange - and, of course,
the SIB.

The SIB Chairman is now proposing a much more centralised and effective
enforcement regime, based partly on US experience. Firstly, he wants to
see the development of a central transaction database covering on-
exchange and off-exchange transactions in both cash and derivatives
markets, so that abuse can be better detected. Secondly, the
investigation of abuse needs to be strengthened, particularly where
misconduct is of a criminal nature. And, finally, there should be more
effective enforcement action to deal with cases where abuse has been
established - as already reflected in the SIB's willingness to use its
powers under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban people
from the investment industry.

In the areas of investigation and enforcement the SIB is now focusing
its efforts on more rigorous monitoring of the performance of the SROs
that come under its wing. This is being done through on-site
supervisory reviews of both the SROs themselves and (more
controversially) individual regulated firms. However, the SIB believes
that it is handicapped through insufficient statutory powers:
specifically, powers relating to the appointment of officers of SROs
and the imposition of monetary penalties on SROs where there is a
failure to comply with regulations.

In addition, the SIB would like to possess punitive powers over
authorised firms (eg the power to impose fines). The belief is that
fallback enforcement powers of this kind would encourage more decisive
action by SROs who would wish to avoid any need for the SIB to
intervene.

But the most radical new ideas on enforcement concern the interface
between the civil and criminal law. Mr Large has pointed out that in
the US, market abuse may be dealt with both under the criminal law and
as an administrative "offence", for which the SEC may impose penalties
of three times the profit made. The most serious cases are dealt with
by criminal prosecutors but in many other cases the civil route is
preferred, the public interest being served by the payment of financial
penalties to the SEC, which passes them to the US Treasury. This regime
is further buttressed by a plea-bargaining system which often avoids
the need for protracted legal proceedings.

Mr Large evidently sees much to be admired in the US enforcement
regime, and on the particular issue of plea-bargaining he expressed his
views forcefully earlier this month:

"I believe it cannot be beyond the wit of man, and certainly not beyond
the combined brain power of our best legal minds, to devise a fair and
open system of plea-negotiations which respects the role of the
judiciary in sentencing, a guilty defendant's desire to own up quickly
and on all fronts, and the needs of our criminal and regulatory-
enforcement agencies to secure their respective objectives without
wasting valuable resources - that could command real public
confidence."

The fact is that the law, and the law enforcement agencies, have
fallen into disrepute following a succession of failed prosecutions
involving allegations of financial fraud and market abuse. The public
perception is that the UK legal/ regulatory system is simply incapable
of dealing with serious misconduct based on sophisticated exploitation
of London's increasingly complex financial markets. The SIB chairman
clearly wants to do something about this, but it will require the co-
operation of Parliament and, above all, the legal profession, if
financial law and order is to be restored.

SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

In reply to an unusually large volume of negative comments, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has modified its earlier
proposed rule requiring reporting by "large traders" both inside and
outside the US on transactions effected in "publicly traded securities"
using US market facilities. (For a description of the originally
proposed rule, see FT-FRR January 1992.)

As re-proposed, Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identify
themselves to the SEC, and require their brokers to maintain records of
the large traders' activity, to be provided to the SEC upon request. A
large trader is a person who, for an account he owns or controls,
effects transactions, during a calendar day where the account is
located, in publicly traded securities, aggregating at least the lesser
of (a) 200,000 shares with a fair market value of $2 million, or (b)
$10 million fair market value, or that constitute "program trading."
("Program trading" is either index arbitrage or any trading strategy
involving the related purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more
publicly traded securities with fair market value of at least
$1,000,000.)

The modifications are designed to reduce the number of traders
affected, as well as the burdens and costs of the proposed system on
both large traders and their brokers. This is accomplished through:
clarifying the definition of a large trader; increasing the minimum
level of trading that requires reporting; reducing the amount of
information required for filing; streamlining the filing itself, as
well as providing for an inactive status; improving the instructions
for filing; reducing record keeping requirements; providing special
reporting requirements for execution times; and defining a safe harbour
for the broker's duty to supervise his large trader clients.

The large trader reporting system, if approved as re-proposed, will
require large traders to file Form 13H with the SEC to obtain a large
trader identification number (LTID). Each trader is then responsible
for advising his brokers of his LTID and all accounts to which it
applies. These brokers must maintain records of the trades for the
accounts, which they will be required to provide to the SEC upon
request. The brokers must also supervise their clients' compliance with
the rule. The large traders themselves are required to update Form 13H
annually.

In the re-proposal, the large trader definition has been clarified to
include a person who effects transactions "for an account that he owns
or controls" in place of the original "for his own account or an
account for which he exercises investment discretion." According to the
SEC, this change is merely a clarification and does not change the
functional meaning of the definition. The re-proposal includes similar
clarifications with regard to the definitions of "person," "account,"
"ownership," "control," and "transaction." The revisions are designed
to limit the reach of the large trader definition by limiting the
number of accounts that are deemed to be owned or controlled
indirectly.

Probably the most important modification is that of the increase in the
level of activity which identifies one as a large trader. The
identifying activity level for any 24-hour period would increase from
activity involving 100,000 shares or a fair market value of $4 million
to 200,000 shares or a fair market value of $10 million. In addition,
those 200,000 shares must have a fair market value of $2 million, in
effect excluding from large trader status many who trade in large
volumes of lower priced securities. The re-proposed activity levels are
also intended to minimise the impact of the rule on natural persons who
infrequently trade large amounts of securities.

To simplify the identification of activity which requires reporting,
the SEC has proposed to change the 24-hour period to "a calendar day
where the account is located." The change will preclude the need to
aggregate trades occurring on different days, or to "correct" for time
zone differences. An account is deemed to be located at the principal
place of business of the broker, not where the client is located.

The re-proposal narrows the scope of the rules for aggregation of
accounts and transactions. This is accomplished partly through the
modifications to the definitions of "ownership" and "control." In
addition, aggregation of accounts will not be required where the
aggregation would include accounts of a person who would independently
qualify as a large trader. On the other hand, aggregation will be
required to include accounts of any other person who would not
independently qualify as a large trader. Further, under no
circumstances shall a person or group acting in concert toward a common
investment objective be allowed to disaggregate where that
disaggregation would permit them to avoid large trader identification.

Modifications to the filing requirements provide that a large trader
must file its original Form 13H within 10 days after it initially
reaches the identifying activity level; and within 60 days after the
end of each year thereafter. The re-proposal has rejected the original
requirement that large traders submit a new Form 13H each time the
"information contained therein becomes inaccurate for any reason," in
favour of the single annual update. In addition, the new form provides
for "inactive status" filing, by which a trader is exempt from annual
filing requirements until and unless it subsequently reaches the
identifying activity level. At that point, the trader again has 10 days
to "reactivate" by filing Form 13H.

Form 13H and its schedules and instructions have been modified to
reflect the changes in the Rule and have been generally simplified. The
re-proposed Form 13H allows for incorporation by reference of
information already on file with the SEC. The requirement for detailed
information regarding persons who own or control large trader
organizations has been largely eliminated. The schedules for listing
new accounts have also been revised, corresponding to the large
trader's status as owner, controller or custodian/ nominee of the
accounts.

With regard to the duties of broker-dealers, the rule requires that
they report electronically transactions that reach a certain level for
persons who they know or have reason to know are large traders. The
level of trading activity that must be reported is increased in the re-
proposed rule from 1,000 shares or a fair market value of $40,000 to
2,000 shares or a fair market value of $100,000. This change also
incorporates the change from a 24-hour period to a "calendar day." The
SEC recommends that brokers inform persons they have reason to know are
large traders of their obligations to identify themselves to the SEC.
Although the principal responsibility for compliance in placed on large
traders, brokers have a duty to identify large traders. The re-proposal
provides "a safe harbour" for brokers in this regard, provided they
adopt and follow reasonable procedures to identify large traders.

Finally, the SEC maintains that the burdens imposed by the proposed
rule on foreign entities are "necessary and appropriate" and "not
unduly burdensome," given their uniform application to foreign and
domestic entities. The re-proposal points out that, through the
redefinitions of identifying activity level as well as the concepts of
"ownership" and "control," the effect of the rule on foreign entities
is greatly reduced.

PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATION

Both the Senate and House Banking Committees have now passed their
versions of interstate banking legislation, and prospects are good that
both Bills will pass the respective Houses of Congress before the July
4 holidays. That will provide time before the end of the Congressional
year for a conference between the Houses to resolve differences between
the two Bills, and passage of a landmark interstate banking Bill this
Congress.

House
The House Banking Committee passed HR 3841, the "Interstate Banking
Efficiency Act of 1994", by a vote of 50-1, and it should be reported
to the full House of Representatives within the next 30-60 days. Senior
members of the Committee are considering placing it on the portion of
the agenda of the House known as the suspension calendar, usually
reserved for non-controversial Bills. While that may not succeed, since
two-thirds of those voting are required to pass such a Bill, the mere
fact that it is being considered shows that the Bill has solid strength
and will very likely pass the full House.

The Bill is similar to the Bill passed by the Financial Institutions
Subcommittee, changed only by modest amendments related to branch
closing requirements, statistical data collection, and inter-affiliate
agency activities. Efforts to impose crippling amendments sought by con-
sumer activists were soundly defeated.

The House Bill would permit acquisitions of banks across state lines
one year after passage of the Bill with no authority for states to
prohibit such acquisitions. Consolidation of interstate banks within a
holding company into a single branch network could take place 18 months
after passage. States would be able to prohibit branching by passing
legislation any time within three years after passage of the Bill, and
if a bank holding company had consolidated its subsidiary banks within
such states into an interstate branch network before the passage of
three years, it would be required to convert them back into banks as
they existed prior to the consolidation.

De novo interstate branching, as opposed to acquisitions and
consolidations, could take place only if a state expressly permits it
by statute. States would also be able, during a three-year period
following passage of the Bill, to prohibit interstate branching through
acquisitions.

Branches of national banks would be subject to the laws of the host
state with respect to con-sumer protection, fair lending, and community
re-investment as though they were branches of a state bank chartered in
that state. Branches of state banks would be subject to the laws of the
host state as though they were branches of a state bank chartered in
that state.

Foreign banks would be free to branch interstate with wholesale
branches and would not have to establish a subsidiary bank to do so,
but no change is made in the current law which requires establishment
of a subsidiary bank for conducting retail banking activity, whether
such activity be conducted through a branch or a bank. In other words,
if a foreign bank wished to engage in interstate retail banking
activity, it would have to do so through a US subsidiary bank.

Senate
The Senate Banking Committee passed its interstate banking Bill,
currently unnumbered and known as the "Interstate Banking and Branching
Act of 1994", by unanimous vote, and it is expected to pass the full
Senate before the Easter recess. It differs from the House Banking
Committee Bill in some key respects.

Interstate acquisition authority mirrors the House Bill, and no
significant differences need be debated in conference on that part of
the Bill. In the Senate Banking Committee Bill, interstate
consolidation, however, may not occur until two years after passage, as
opposed to 18 months in the House Banking Committee Bill.

Under the Senate Banking Committee Bill branches of national banks
would be treated in a host state as though they were branches of a
national bank chartered in that state. Branches of state banks would be
treated as though they were branches of state banks chartered in that
state.

Foreign branches do not fare as well under the Senate Banking Committee
Bill as under the House Banking Committee Bill. While a foreign bank
which had established a subsidiary bank to engage in retail banking
would be permitted to branch (as would any other US bank) it appears
that it would not be permitted to establish interstate wholesale
branches without first establishing a subsidiary bank, unless the state
law expressly permitted such activity. It appears, however, that it
would continue to be able to have representative offices, agencies, and
loan production offices in all states not specifically prohibited by
state laws, as long as those entities only conducted wholesale banking
activities.

Under both the Senate and House Banking Committee Bills there are
limits on the aggregate amount of deposits which can be retained in a
firm which expands by acquisition, although those limits differ
slightly.

Prognosis
Interstate banking seems to be alive and doing well in this Congress.
While passage of onerous provisions urged by consumer activists may
still derail final passage in the House, the prospects now are good
that an interstate Bill will pass this year.

The conference between the two Houses on the Bill will be difficult.
Significant differences exist on a wide range of subjects such as
determination of applicable law governing interstate branches, timing
and effect of state actions vis-e-vis branching, effect on foreign
branch activity, concentration limits, and the effective date for the
conduct of activities permitted by the Bills.

Similarly, the shadow of serious disruption of Congressional activity
which might be occasioned by hearings into the "Whitewater" affair are
beginning to build, and what Bills that might retard or scuttle are
unpredictable.

Still, for the first time since the McFadden Act was passed in 1927,
Congress appears to be prepared to liberalise laws governing interstate
banking and branching activity.

FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS

The Federal Reserve Board ("the Board") has proposed revisions to
existing risk-based capital standards as part of the implementation of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).

In line with the Basle Accord, US banks currently calculate their
regulatory capital requirement on the basis of credit risks associated
with broad categories of assets and off-balance-sheet instruments.
Institutions are required to maintain a level of capital equal to at
least eight per cent of their risk weighted assets.

The proposed modifications would seek to adjust capital standards so as
to take into account the following factors:

1 The degree concentration of credit risk in a bank's loan portfolio.

2 An institution's ability to manage credit risk.

3 An institution's ability to manage the risks posed by involvement in
non-traditional activities.

Although the Board recognises that there is no generally accepted
approach to identifying and quantifying the risks associated with
concentration, it proposes that institutions with significant levels of
credit-risk concentration should hold additional capital. They note
that the information to achieve this is already available. Banks can
identify and track loans by industry, geographical location, country,
and loan type. This information would form the basis for the new
standard.

While the Board recognises that there are potential gains in risk
reduction through portfolio diversification, it is aware that there are
also potential pitfalls. For example, it is concerned that a bank
should not seek to achieve diversification by "lending in unfamiliar
market areas to out-of-territory borrowers or by rapid expansion of new
loan products for which the situation does not have adequate
expertise." They are anxious that any new regulations will not create
false incentives for management that will unintentionally decrease the
soundness of the banking industry.

The proposal does not identify specific categories of non-traditional
activities that it proposed to monitor. The Federal Reserve recognises
that new developments in technology and financial instruments have led
banks to become involved in activities that have not been associated
with their traditional business. They are aware of claims that any new
regulations could limit the ability of institutions to compete with non-
bank competitors. However, they are concerned that the risks associated
with any new activities should be promptly analysed and that capital
should be increased appropriately. The ability of an institution to
manage such risks will be taken into account.

The Federal Reserve notes that "the final supervisory judgement on a
bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that
might be drawn solely from the level of its risk-based capital ratio".
In addition to those factors which influence portfolio diversification
and a bank's management skills, they will also be looking at factors
such as interest-rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks;
and the quality and level of earnings.

SEC PROPOSES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEMS

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently proposed Rule 17a-
23 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act")
requiring brokers and dealers that operate automatic trading systems
(broker-dealer trading systems or BDTSs) to maintain participant,
volume and transaction records to be reported periodically to the SEC.

Under the 1934 Act, sponsors of BDTSs must register as broker-dealers
and are subject to its normal record keeping and reporting
requirements; they are not, however, required to identify separately
those transactions effected through the BDTSs, nor to summarise the
volume or type of activity occurring through the automated systems.
Additionally, numerous automated trading systems operate pursuant to no-
action letters obtained from the SEC at the commencement of their
operation.

In 1989, the SEC proposed a rule that would have required sponsors of
BDTSs to comply with a number of procedural and substantive
specifications. The SEC now believes, in light of the favourable
findings of its Market 2000 Study (See FT-FRR February, 1994 for a
description of that study), that enhanced record keeping and reporting
will be sufficient for purposes of detecting potentially or actual
fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative practices and protecting the
public interest in the automated trading arena.

The rule is intended to assist the SEC in evaluating the role of
computerisation and automation in the securities industry, with an eye
toward the goals of the national market system, to monitor the effect
of BDTSs on competition, and to reassess whether broker-dealer
regulation remains the appropriate method for monitoring these systems.

The proposed rule would apply only to those systems through which
actual execution or at least matching of orders occurs automatically,
excluding those systems which merely automate the collection of orders
or the routing of orders but do not provide for automated matching of
buy and sell orders within the system. BDTS sponsors will be required
to maintain records of daily summaries of trading; time-sequenced
records of all trades; information regarding system participants as
well as applicants who have been denied participation; and all notices
sent by the sponsor to the participants. The sponsors will be required
to file with the SEC an initial description of their system and its
operation; quarterly summaries of activity; and notification of
material changes or cessation of operations. The proposed rule
specifies no particular format for these submissions, in recognition of
the variance in internal procedures already established by BDTSs.

The SEC stated in its proposal that the anticipated costs to sponsors
in order to comply with these requirements "do not appear to be
significant," as many sponsors already maintain their own records and
the automated nature of the systems facilitates accurate and timely
data collection.

STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATION

More than 70 organizations responded to the Stock Exchange's
Consultative Document on the dissemination of price-sensitive
information (see FT-FRR November 1993 pp 7-8).

The following points raised have resulted in changes:

False market. Several respondents indicated that they were unclear
about the scope of the obligation in the Listing Rules to avoid the
creation of a false market in their shares. Are they obliged to correct
any errors in market perception which lead them to feel that their
shares are wrongly valued? Many companies consider that their
responsibility to correct errors in market perception should only arise
when the cause of the error originates - or appears to originate - from
the company or its agents.

Companies should not have to be "incessantly concerned" with comments
on their performance, their sector or their competitors. The Exchange
will be examining, in consultation with the Treasury and market
participants, possible changes to its Official Listing Rules to clarify
that a company which is keeping the market properly informed only has a
regulatory obligation to correct misconceptions in the market when the
source of the error is itself or its agents. Factual correction of
inaccurate information from a third party should be a matter of
sensible judgement and good practice by the company.

There will have to be further consultation by the Exchange on the basis
of the text of the revised rule. The present text of the guidance
reflects existing Listing Rules.

Confidential. Concern had been expressed that the draft guidance does
not fully reflect the situation where a company should not make an
announcement. There may be occasions when a company's duties to its
shareholders, employees and creditors conflict with any duty of prompt
disclosure to the market as a whole. In response to this, the Working
Party has included a new paragraph on the handling of confidential
information. The Working Party did not intend this guidance to imply
that companies could not keep commercially sensitive information
confidential until the appropriate moment for its announcement.

Responsibility for issuing information. The revised guidance makes it
clear that in the Working Party's opinion, policies concerning the
handling of price-sensitive information must be set by the Board of a
company, though the implementation of the policy may be delegated.

Annual General Meeting. Some commented that public occasions such as
Annual General Meetings were unsuitable for intelligent discussion
between directors and shareholders because they were so sparsely
attended.

The Working Party would "deplore" a situation where the public
proceedings at the AGMs remain anodyne, whilst influential audiences
are briefed privately on sensitive matters. Companies must remember
their obligation to announce formally - either before or at the time of
the meeting - any price-sensitive information which is to be given at
the meeting.

Significance. Some consultees have suggested that the guidance, if
taken to extremes, would require a company to monitor constantly all
comments about itself, its competitors and its marketplace to see if
they created the need for some statement of clarification. The guidance
has been amplified to stress that an assessment must always be made of
the significance of information. The guidance is not intended to lead
to a stream of inconsequential announcements.

Status of guidance. The Working Party was strongly urged to clarify the
status of the guidance in proceedings either in a court or as a result
of action by the Exchange as Competent Authority. The guidance cannot
constrain any regulatory body and compliance with it will not
necessarily constitute a defence in the event of regulatory action
being taken. However, the Board of the Stock Exchange has agreed that
the Exchange will take into account judgements made by companies in
accordance with the guidance.

List of what constitutes price-sensitive information. No respondent
believed that price-sensitive information should be defined by
reference to a given percentage movement in share price, but a few
suggested that a list of likely price-sensitive events might be
helpful. The Working Party has gone some way to meeting this request
but has emphasised that any list is inevitably deficient in those grey
areas where companies may be most anxious for guidance.

Making people insiders. Some respondents suggested that the very act of
asking a shareholder if he consents to become an insider will convey
price-sensitive information to him, in that he may well have a shrewd
idea of what he is likely to be told. If shareholders wish to avoid
being placed in this position and are reluctant to lose their ability
to trade, even for a short period, they should make this policy known.

Quarterly statements. In general, respondents did not wish this part of
the guidance to become prescriptive and endorsed the tone of the
consultative paper. Some thought that it was inappropriate for the
market to be given figures which had not been externally verified. The
Working Party disagrees that the market will be misled by such
information provided that its status is made completely clear at the
time of the announcement.

Analysts. The guidance now contains some observations on how analysts
should behave in the conduct of their relationships with companies.
Many analysts are employed by firms which are members of the Exchange
and, even if the Exchange has no statutory responsibility for their
conduct, it feels it should encourage best practice, especially as
companies are expected to handle their side of these contacts with
great care.

Small companies. The guidance is applicable to every size of company.
It is acknowledged that companies whose progress is followed by only a
few analysts will have particular problems if those analysts are wildly
wrong in their forecasts and may well need to consider whether they
need to make a correcting announcement.

SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDING

The Securities and Investment Board has announced proposals to end
cross-contributions for SFA and IMRO members with regard to the
Investors Compensation Scheme.

The proposals have been drawn up in the light of comments which the SIB
has received in response to its Discussion Paper, "Financing Investors
Compensation", published in October 1993.

The proposals are as follows:

* to end cross-contributions, as of April 1 1994 for SFA and IMRO
members, and on recognition of PIA for members of FIMBRA, LAUTRO and
SIBRO;

* to set up separate contribution arrangements for SFA, IMRO and, if
recognised, PIA, with a cap of #100 million for each SRO;

* to treat SIBRO firms as belonging to the relevant SRO for
compensation purposes;

* to continue with a unitary scheme, administered, as now, by ICS, with
separate SRO funds;

* to change the basis for allocating management costs to an activity-
related basis, as far as possible;

* to give SROs increased control over, and responsibility for, looking
after their own arrangements for financing their own compensation
liabilities.

Cross-contribution
There was unanimous support for the proposed ending of cross-
contribution and the SIB proposes to set up separate contribution
arrangements for individual SROs, with no cross contribution between
them. However, there was concern about the proposal that there should
be caps of #100 million for each of SFA, IMRO and PIA.

The fact that an SRO has a cap of #100 million does not necessarily
mean that it has to levy the full #100 million on its membership in any
one year. It would be open to an SRO to avoid having to do this by
borrowing on its own credit.

Treatment of "SIBRO" firms
The ending of cross-contribution raises the question of how SIBRO firms
should be treated. The SIB last year indicated its preference that
direct regulation should be available only as a last resort. The
Discussion Paper proposed that, instead of remaining a separate
constituency with its own cap, SIBRO firms should be treated, for
compensation purposes, as belonging to the relevant SRO.

This was the only other proposal in the Discussion Paper which aroused
significant comment. Concern related to: the inappropriateness of
breaking the link between compensation and regulation; the requirement
in s54(3) that so far as practicable an SRO's contribution to ICS
should reflect claims experience in its own constituency; and the
practicalities of identifying the appropriate SRO.

However, the SIB did not find these arguments persuasive and remains
convinced that the original proposal is the most appropriate way
forward. Rather than breaking the link between compensation and
regulation, the SIB sees the proposed approach as emphasising the value
of community of interest as between investment firms in the three
eventual groups (SFA, IIRO and PIA) in effective regulation. Apart from
SIBRO members who are applicants for membership of a SRO, who will be
treated as belonging to that SRO's group, the presumption is that the
relevant SRO will be PIA (if recognised) unless a firm is predominantly
engaged in dealing (in which case, it will be SFA) or managing (in
which case, it will be IMRO).

Separate SRO funds
or separate schemes?
There was very little support for the idea of entirely separate SRO
schemes, each with their own administration. Accordingly, the SIB
proposes to proceed on the basis of a unitary scheme, administered by
ICS, but with separate SRO funds.

Management costs
The SIB proposes that the first #300,000 of management costs should be
treated as fixed costs and that these should be divided equally between
SROs. The SIB proposes that the variable costs element should be
allocated on an experience-related basis according to a 3-year rolling
index which takes account of the number of defaults occurring in each
constituency and the number of claims related to each constituency
handled by the Scheme in that three-year period.

Methods of financing
SRO members' liabilities
Under the present arrangements, SROs are given the status of
administrators of the Scheme for the purpose of the levy procedure
only. In other respects, they act as agents of ICS and it is the SRO
members, rather than the SRO, which owe the liability to the Scheme.

The SIB proposes to change the rules so that the SROs will be
constituted as the administrators of the Scheme for the purposes of
raising the amount required - whether by levy or otherwise - from their
members. The initial liability to pay ICS will thus fall on the
individual SRO, but ICS will retain a right over the SRO's members in
the event of a failure by the SRO to pay or collect and pay over the
sums due to ICS.

The SIB also proposes to enable an SRO to defer - at least, in part -
its members' obligation to pay for compensation liabilities by means of
borrowing.

Representations in respect of the proposals should reach the SIB by
March 25 1994.

THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994

On March 1 1994, The Traded Securities (Disclosure) Regulations 1994
came into force, to give effect to Article 7 of the European
Community's Council Directive (89/592/EEC) of November 13 1989 which
sought to co-ordinate regulations on insider dealing.

Article 7 requires that:

"all companies and undertakings, the transferable securities of which
are, whatever their nature, admitted to trading on a market which is
regulated and supervised by bodies recognised by public bodies,
operates regularly and is accessible directly or indirectly to the
public, should be under an obligation to inform the public as soon as
possible of any major new developments in the issuer's sphere of
activity which are not public knowledge and which may, by virtue of
their effect on the issuer's assets and liabilities or financial
position or on the general course of its business, lead to substantial
movements in the price of the securities admitted to trading".


The regulations stipulate that the above will apply to securities
traded on any regulated market in the United Kingdom, except where the
recognised investment exchange, which regulates and supervises the
regulated market on which an issuer's securities are admitted to
trading, exempts the issuer from this obligation.  It may do so if
satisfied that the disclosure of the particular information would
prejudice the legitimate interests of that issuer.

The regulations go on to state that in the event of failure on the part
of an issuer to comply with such disclosure of information, the rules
of the recognised investment exchange (on which those securities are
traded) must:

* discontinue the admission of the securities to trading; and/or

* suspend trading in the securities; and/or

* publish the fact that the issuer has failed to comply with the
obligation; and/or

* itself make public any information which the issuer has failed to
publish.


The Regulations thus impose important reporting requirements on issuers
of securities traded on regulated markets, although those listed on the
Stock Exchange are already subject to similar rules set out in Chapter
9 of the Yellow Book entitled - Continuing Obligations.

THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAW

On December 27 1993, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
notified banks that there was no need to refrain from entering into
close-out netting agreements. It was said that the MoF had consulted
with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the MoJ had come to the
conclusion that close-out netting provisions would be held valid in the
existing framework under the Bankruptcy Act, the Corporate
Rehabilitation Act and the Civil Code. Strictly speaking, however, even
though Japanese banks are now allowed to enter into close-out netting
agreements with foreign counterparts, the question of validity will
ultimately have to be decided by the Japanese courts, this point being
acknowledged by both ministries.

There has been some substantial discussion among Japanese lawyers on
this issue. The main question appears to be whether a contractual
agreement entered into with a view to setting off, under certain
circumstances such as insolvency of one party, debts which are not due
and payable and are denominated in different currencies will be held
valid under the Japanese insolvency law. Two main points at issue are:

* whether a set-off will work on a cross-currency basis (the "currency
point"); and

* whether an agreement to set-off debts which are not due and payable
will stand under the Japanese insolvency law (the "timing point").

As to the currency point, Article 403 of the Civil Code provides:

"Any debt denominated in a foreign currency may be paid by the debtor
in Japanese currency, the amount of which shall be determined in
accordance with the exchange rate available in the place of payment."

There is also a rule established in a Supreme Court decision that, in
connection with a debt denominated in a foreign currency, the creditor
(not the debtor) may require the debtor to pay in Japanese currency.
The combined effect of these is that one of the parties to a swap
agreement will be able to convert all the outstanding foreign currency
debts into those in Japanese currency, thus enabling such party to
effect set-off as if they were in the same currency. Since this happens
by operation of law, it is argued that there is no reason why an
agreement to set-off on a cross-currency basis should be held invalid
under Japanese law.

As regards the timing point, there is a well established Supreme Court
authority which states that an agreement made between a bank and a
customer to set-off debts which are not due and payable will defeat the
claim of the customer's creditor who obtains a garnishee order over a
deposit which the customer has made with the bank. It is generally
understood that the above rule will apply where a liquidator is
appointed for the customer.

On the basis of these observations, there does not appear to be any
difficulty in affirming the validity of a close-out netting agreement
under the Japanese insolvency law. Such an argument has been advanced
by a leading academic lawyer in Japan and it appears that there has
been an implicit consensus of opinion on these lines among Japanese
lawyers.

Insofar as there are remaining objections, they are likely to relate to
the argument that, while a right to convert currencies is available
under ordinary circumstances, it would be quite another matter for it
to be available in an insolvency situation. The reason behind this is
that to allow creditors who have multi-currency mutual debts to
exercise such a right in an insolvency situation, would give them
further priority over those creditors who do not have such a right,
such as depositors (although the contrary argument can be that since
the right of set-off is firmly established and those creditors having a
right of set-off are given priority over other creditors, it will be
regarded as a relatively minor step to expand the scope to multi-
currency mutual debts). Another problem with the above argument is
that, since the argument is based on Article 403 of the Civil Code,
there is some uncertainty as to a close-out netting agreement embodied
in a contract governed by a legal system other than Japanese law.

It should be noted that the Supreme Court decision referred to with
respect to the timing point took a substantial approach, in which it is
considered that the majority opinion upheld the validity of contractual
set-off against the claim of the garnisher on the basis that such a
function of set-off would enhance convenience in trading and be of
benefit to society as a whole. Although the said Supreme Court decision
dealt only with the timing point, the basic idea may well apply to the
currency point. Such a consideration would probably strengthen the
conclusion reached by Japanese lawyers and would be useful to overcome
the difficulties pointed out above.

It is worth noting that in the Supreme Court decision referred to
above, one of the respected judges added, that if such a right of
contractual set-off was widely acknowledged in a business community,
its validity should be upheld in that business community. It is
interesting that the judge intimated that there could be a special
legal system which would govern a business community. Such an idea has
not been discussed in detail among Japanese lawyers, but would be
useful in this context.

If there is any concern about upholding the validity of close-out
netting, it would be that creditors will be able to erode the principle
of pari passu distribution easily by an agreement with the debtor.
According to the above intimation, however, the validity of close-out
netting will be limited to financial institutions active in the market
(if "business community" may be translated as "market"). It is true
that to protect those financial institutions in such manner would have
a negative impact on other creditors (such as depositors) when a
financial institution goes into liquidation. However, other creditors
(in particular, depositors) would be protected more properly by the
capital adequacy requirements, the deposit insurance scheme and other
regulatory measures.

Although it may still be arguable as to how the validity of close-out
netting should be substantiated, it must be emphasised that almost all
lawyers (including the officials of the MoF and the MoJ) who have
focused on this issue recently have come to the conclusion that a close-
out netting agreement should stand up under Japanese insolvency law. In
order to minimise or even remove the risk, however, it is advisable
that some steps should be taken, which now appear to be possible as
Japanese lawyers have almost reached a consensus. It may be considered
that some relevant institution should formalise the Japanese position,
but it is questionable whether there is any institution which would
perform such a function. More importantly, the Japanese courts, as a
matter of policy, resist being influenced by outside opinions. In such
a judicial climate as exists in Japan, it will probably be more
appropriate to introduce recognition of close-out netting by
legislation.

ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARY

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has selected Asahi Bank as the first city
bank to establish a securities subsidiary. Asahi will be permitted to
open its subsidiary for business from July this year. Under the
Financial System Reform Act, enacted last April, the MoF removed the
original firewalls between commercial banking, trust banking and
securities industries.

Last July, Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-term Credit Bank of
Japan and Norinchurkin Bank set up securities subsidiaries. However,
the MoF delayed the establishment of subsidiaries by city banks because
of strong opposition from the securities industry. The city banks are
feared for their large financial resources, great influence over many
industries and highly trained staff. Because of these fears the MoF has
restricted the activities of bank subsidiaries to dealing and
underwriting bonds.

From the existing 11 city banks:

In July:

Asahi bank has the green light to commence securities operations
through a subsidiary.

In November:

Six other city banks will commence securities business. Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Sakura Bank and Sanwa
Bank.

In March 1995:

In the near future the MoF is expected to approve this date as the
entry point for Tokai Bank and Takushoku Bank to the securities
business.

Of the two remaining city banks, Daiwa Bank took over its securities
subsidiary "Cosmo Securities" last August in a rescue bid. Finally, the
Bank of Tokyo has no immediate plans to enter the securities business.

The MoF announced that it deliberately spread out the entry times so
that the securities industry would not be too disrupted by the
entrants. According to the MoF, by the end of January 1994, the
subsidiaries had underwritten approximately Y50 billion worth of
domestic corporate straight bonds, approximately Y3 billion worth of
domestic convertible bonds and some Y50 billion of overseas bonds.

Last month Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank came to the rescue of Kankaku
Securities by extending subordinated loans of Y70 billion. The two
firms already have close ties but Kankaku stated that it has no
intention of becoming a subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as a result
of the rescue. In the case of Daiwa Bank's bailout of Cosmo Securities
last August, Cosmo issued new shares that were bought by Daiwa, making
the securities firm its subsidiary.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has sent two teams of delegates on a
fact finding mission, one to China and Hong Kong and the other to the
ASEAN countries (Singapore. Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippeans and
Indonesia).

The teams were to visit the region's bourses, accounting firms, legal
firms, institutional investors and local units of Japan's big four
brokerages. Among the issues investigated were the types of settlement
systems, the types of protection given to shareholders and disclosure
regulations. The TSE's aim is to collect information so as to decide
whether Asian shares are safe for Japanese investors. This is seen as
the first step along the road to listing other Asian shares.

CCPC'S FIRST YEAR

The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) was set up in March
1993 as a joint venture between 162 financial institutions. So far 65
city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, life and non-life
insurers have used the CCPC to liquidate troubled debts. The number of
financial institutions using the CCPC is likely to rise in March 1994,
when many companies end their financial year. Estimates of the value of
bad debts that will be sold to the CCPC in March are put in excess of
Y1 trillion.

The banks sell bad debts to the CCPC at a discount, then charge the
loss against their profits, so cutting their tax bills. The CCPC is
then supposed to liquidate the loans by selling the underlying
collateral to private investors. So far it has only been able to sell
Y17 billion of collateral, due to weak demand for real estate. In
contrast the CCPC has bought Y1.33 trillion worth of bad debts with a
face value of Y2.86 trillion.

In the 1993/94 financial year the Ministry of Finance (MoF) restrained
the sales of bad loans to the CCPC, to avoid large tax losses. This
policy has now changed and the MoF wants to accelerate the banks' write-
offs dramatically. The goal of the MoF is to strengthen banks' balance
sheets in the face of unprecedented enormous bad debts.

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has announced that changes to the Listing
Rules have been approved, which prohibit multiple applications for
public offerings of securities and which should limit the occurrence of
undetected multiple applications. The new rules came into effect on
March 16 1994.

The new rules require issuers, their sponsors and underwriters to take
responsible steps to ensure multiple or suspected multiple applications
are identified and rejected. In addition, any application form for a
public offering of securities will have to be worded in such a way that
the applicant is required to declare that only one application is being
made by him or for his benefit. The new rules also specify that any
application for more than 100 per cent of the securities on offer will
be deemed to be a multiple application, which will therefore have to be
rejected.

CONSULTATIVE PAPER ISSUED BY THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has recently issued a 38-page consultative
paper entitled "The Way Forward" as part of its current project to
develop a strategic plan for the three years up to the hand over of
Hong Kong to China in 1997 and beyond. It has invited comments on the
paper by April 22 and expects the strategic plan to be publicised in
mid-1994.

The consultative paper summarises discussions that have been held with
market participants of issues facing the market and possible ways
forward. It also indicates the Exchange's response to each of the
proposals, which ranges from specific measures, through inviting
further suggestions, to stating that it does not intend to take the
proposals further. The list of market participants with whom the
Exchange held discussions includes as well as issuers, stock brokers
and fund managers, a wide range of interested bodies and individuals
such as The Hong Kong Association of Banks, The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, The Hong Kong Society of Accountants, academics and
information providers. The stated purpose of the paper is to get an
indication of the market's general views. If the market shows support
for a particular course of action, the Exchange may conduct a separate
more detailed consultation at a later stage.

The main emphasis of the consultative paper is on identifying ways in
which the Hong Kong's stock market can maintain its competitiveness in
an international context, as well as facilitating its role as a source
of international funds for the continued economic expansion in China.
The paper identifies certain key issues which are facing the Exchange:
* the maturity of the Hong Kong market in terms of domestic listings
and the need therefore to attract more listings of overseas companies
in order to maintain growth;

* the significance of overseas investors to the recent growth in the
Asian markets and the need to maintain and promote this interest;

* the importance of China's economic development to the future of the
Exchange and the role the Exchange can play in helping to fund that
development;

* the increasing demand for sophisticated derivative products for risk
management purposes or as trading vehicles;

* the need to be up-to-date in the secondary market in terms of market
automation, to facilitate higher trading volumes and meet the
increasingly complex demands of investors;

* the competition from other Asian exchanges, and the need to stay
ahead or at least equal with their development of derivative products
and automated dealing systems; and

* the need to promote the growth of the bond market in Hong Kong,
possibly as an alternative means of raising funds for Chinese companies
rather than equity issues.

Recurring themes in the consultative paper are the need to provide a
market that has the highest level of transparency and efficiency and
the need for a market which attracts investor attention. In this
respect, the Exchange believes that the emphasis must now be on an
"international" rather than local solution, as had been the case in the
past.

The consultative paper outlines options for the development of the
Exchange which should meet the stated aims of transparency, efficiency
and international competitiveness.

Some of the options involve building on existing developments. These
include the introduction last year of the Automatic Order Matching and
Execution System (AMS) and the first direct listings of China
incorporated enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as the ongoing
development of a traded options market, expected to be launched in
early 1995, and improvements to the debt listing regime.

Other options involve establishing a new direction for the Exchange as
part of the search for international solutions. New developments which
the Exchange is considering further include:

* re-orientating the Listing Rules of the primary market towards the
international arena by basing them on a listing philosophy similar to
the US, which would rely on extensive disclosure and self-regulation by
issuers and financial advisors, backed by strong sanctions against non-
compliance;

* relaxing the rules that require overseas entities to provide
shareholders with the same standard of legal protection as under Hong
Kong law. It is suggested that the US approach of requiring compliance
with the overseas entity's domestic corporate governance regime but
with the US accounting disclosure and accounting requirements would be
attractive to overseas entities;

* strengthening the corporate governance regime for listed companies,
for example by making audit committees and properly qualified finance
directors and company secretaries mandatory;

* improving the current disclosure requirements, such as requiring more
detail in the annual report, involving the auditors in interim
announcements and requiring annual asset valuations in the accounts;

* establishing a formal regime for the regulation of sponsors and
financial advisors, which may be backed by legislation;

* including members' internal control systems in the Exchange's
inspection programmes and considering whether further measures are
necessary to improve members' internal control systems;

* improving the automation of the market and considering the
possibility of off-floor trading;

* improving the provision of real-time trading information to the
market and developing a "quality of market" function to monitor and
facilitate improvement in market transparency on a more formal basis;

* introducing appropriate training programmes and allowing the
interface of AMS terminals with members' in house systems to facilitate
the development of sophisticated trading strategies in the secondary
market;

* extending the trading hours of the market which may allow a short
over-lap with the start of trading in London;

* reforming the current disclosure regime arising from the Securities
(Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance, which is thought to be onerous in
some respects and inadequate in others;

* increasing the current requirements for the minimum public float of
securities in a listed issuer and improving monitoring procedures;

* abolishing the board lot system and the rules for spreads, in
conjunction with the full immobilization or de-materialization of share
certificates;

* dissolving the Fidelity Fund or merging it with the clearing house's
guarantee funds and increasing the size of the maximum payment of
compensation by the Compensation Fund in the case of member defaults;

* considering the appropriateness of penalties for misconduct and the
feasibility of establishing arbitration facilities for disputes between
members and between members and their clients;

* enabling listed issuers to include their repurchased shares in their
balance sheets as treasury stock held for subsequent re-sale; and

* reviewing the relationship between the Exchange and the Securities
and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to ensure
greater co-ordination of responsibilities and resources and
consolidation of the different statutory instruments and non-statutory
codes covering the securities market.

In addition, the paper identifies areas where improvements or new
measures might be welcome and the Exchange specifically invites
suggestions for future developments in these areas. They include:

* developing listed Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chip
companies; and

* measures, beyond those for streamlining the listing process currently
being considered by the Exchange, to develop the bond market further.

The paper identifies three proposals which the Exchange does not intend
to take any further. These are marketmaking for stocks, introducing a
second-tier board for smaller companies which do not meet the full
Listing Rules requirements and introducing a trading-only board, with
no compliance requirements for the issuers concerned.

Although in the Foreword to the consultative paper the Exchange
stresses that these are tentative proposals which are open to comment
at this stage, in the body of the paper the Exchange identifies the
direction of the strategy for the years to 1997 and beyond. This
direction is focused on attracting overseas issuers and investors,
possibly by moving towards a US style disclosure-based regulatory
regime, and increasing the role of automation and sophisticated
products in the secondary markets. Press response in Hong Kong to the
proposals has been favourable, although doubts have been raised as to
the feasibility of introducing a US style disclosure regime in the next
three to five years, and the appropriateness of such a regime, which
would include reduced vetting by the Exchange, for new issues in Hong
Kong.

PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE"

A joint approach to the supervision of "bancassurance" in the European
Union is still a far way off. While there is agreement on some basic
principles such as the need for transparency of group structures, the
exchange of information, the role of auditors and the monitoring of
intra-group exposures, the main point of contention remains the
question of group surveillance of capital.

Consolidation would be the "natural" tendency of bank supervisors;
however, it has not been conclusively shown that this method is
adaptable for the control of insurance groups. Insurance supervisors
propose the "solo-plus" approach, whereby pure solo supervision of each
of the components of a group is extended to include elements of group-
wide risk assessment. The issue was the subject of a "jumbo" meeting of
EU finance supervisors in Brussels on February 23, and discussed during
a seminar held at the Central for European Policy Studies (CEPS) on
March 15.

Financial conglomerates are defined as "group of companies with
specific control relationships or under joint management, and whose
activities consist largely or exclusively of providing services in at
least two of the following financial sectors: banking, securities,
insurance." This refers in practice to many different structures: they
can be horizontal or vertical, headed by a supervised or unsupervised
entity, which may be a financial or a mixed-activity holding. According
to recent data, there are more than 200 financial conglomerates in the
EU. Some Member States already allow consolidated accounts of
conglomerates, although it is far from clear whether this would be
permitted under EC legislation.

While the European Commission does not want to stop the development of
financial conglomerates, which they see as a source of strength for the
Union's financial services sector, Member States' supervisory
authorities disagree on the way to control the capital adequacy of such
conglomerates at the group level. Different regulatory rules and tests
are applied at national and Community level, and wide variations exist
in the accounting treatment. There is however agreement on two basic
propositions, as Patrick Pearson of the Commission's DG XV said at the
CEPS seminar: all solo supervisors should monitor the full risks of the
conglomerate; and sufficient capital should be appropriately
distributed and available in the group to cover risks.

Some "easier" issues regarding financial conglomerates have already
been dealt with in the draft BCCI follow-up Directive. This proposal
sets a 20 per cent participation as the threshold for the inclusion of
a company in a group. It requires group structures to be transparent
and says that the head office should be in the same Member States as
the registered office. It furthermore requires auditors to provide
relevant information to the supervisory authorities. However, the
definition of groups was criticized at the CEPS seminar by an industry
representative as an example of excessive regulation, and it was
questioned whether reporting obligations could be strengthened by law.
But there was agreement that further efforts should be undertaken to
lower the obstacles to the exchange of information among supervisory
authorities, and that a lead supervisor should be designated for the
control of conglomerates. Reference was in this respect made to the
"protocol" model applied by the Dutch authorities.

On the matter of how best to tackle the most striking problem in the
control of financial conglomerates, the prevention of double gearing,
the opinions of regulators diverge. Double gearing is the double use of
regulatory capital in the different entities of the group. Banking and
investment firms supervisors would adopt consolidated supervision to
tackle this problem, but it is not obvious that this is the method to
apply to control bancassurance groups, since it is not proven that the
capital requirement for both parts is identical. The way therefore to
deal with double gearing in the immediate future is the automatic
deduction of participations, or the deduction of a minimum solvency
margin. However, automatic deduction is not required under the EU
banking and insurance Directives.

Other prudential concerns should also be dealt with in the near future.
Capital requirements can be circumvented through the use of unregulated
entities, such as leasing and factoring firms. In the other direction,
the holding company controlling the group can be used to distort the
capital standards. The latter problem was partly addressed in the
amendments to the consolidated supervision Directive (92/30). However,
it thereby only applies to financial holding companies, controlling
credit institutions, and it does not include mixed-activity holding
companies nor insurance companies in the consolidation. One proposal is
to introduce "fit and proper" criteria for the shareholders of a
holding company, but it remains to be seen whether this is feasible. A
further problem is "incestuous capitalisation", whereby own funds
elements are purchased by other intra- or extra-group entities, a
practice which cannot be prohibited by regulators. Limits should also
be set for intra-group loans and large exposures. The latter limits
exist in the banking and investment services sector, but not in
insurance. It might for example bring the banking arm of a conglomerate
to place its large exposures within the insurance undertaking.

As a medium-term solution, it was proposed that the solo-plus approach
should be adopted, whereby extra elements are added to the solo
control, namely the exchange of information, the monitoring of intra-
group transactions and transparency, and a minimum solvency for the
parents' company capital. Banking supervisors will however continue to
push for full consolidation. As Jean-Louis Duplat, President of the
Belgian Banking & Finance Commission and Vice-Chairman of the European
Commission's Banking Advisory Committee, said: "The solo-plus approach
offers a suitable solution for the time being, . . . the principle of
supervision on a consolidated basis, completed with aspects of solo
supervision, and, if necessary, sub-consolidated per pole (banking and
insurance pole), should be the final objective."

CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDS

Despite widespread speculation in late February that market volatility
may have been increased by activities of US hedge funds (in selling
bonds and trading financial derivatives), the central banks governors
decided at their meeting in early March against any immediate moves
towards curbing hedge funds' activities.

Hedge funds are not under the direct control of central banks, since,
although mainly managed in the US, they are normally based offshore.
However, their activities have still caused concern to the regulators
for a number of reasons:

* their activities appear to have added to market volatility;

* heavy losses following unsuccessful speculation (eg on currency
movement) might lead to defaults on loans from banks where a hedge fund
is highly geared;

* failure to settle a contract could lead to a chain of defaults
occurring throughout the financial system.

Any attempt to increase control over hedge funds would, however,
encounter difficulties, whether the chosen approach was one of direct
regulation or an increase of existing indirect control (via supervised
banks). Direct regulation would be difficult, since it would need to
tackle cross-border issues, define "hedge funds" and also try to
isolate the particular activities causing concern (given that short-
term leverage risk is in itself a common investment strategy). The
alternative of an indirect approach by the central banks would instead
focus on loans made by supervised banks to hedge funds for the purchase
of assets. Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board are
currently studying the implications of the ensuing credit risk
exposure, in light of the banks' common practice of only holding assets
to the value of the cash lent, with a margin of around 5 per cent or
less to cover risks. The concern here is that such margins would not be
large enough to cover sudden changes in hedge funds' positions,
particularly given that the credit risk of hedge funds is hard to
analyse, since they are not credit rated, have complex structures and
holders may also not provide net asset valuations. Additionally, recent
netting and market risk proposals by international supervisors seem
likely to reduce the requirement for banks to set aside capital against
such hedge fund exposures.

For the present therefore, the central banks appear happy simply to
monitor the situation, whilst keeping a closer eye on hedge funds'
activities. Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman of
the G-10 governors, summarised this approach, saying:

"We are willing to examine closely what is going on with these new
techniques, but we do not think that there is for the time being any
need for specific regulations. We think we have got to live with these
new techniques, but will follow closely what is going on."

REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The International Accounting Standards Committee ("IASC") has issued a
revised proposed International Accounting Standard on financial
instruments (Exposure Draft E48) for comment. This draft results from a
reconsideration of an earlier proposal (Exposure Draft E40) issued in
September 1991.

The draft covers the accounting for the disclosure, recognition,
measurement and presentation of all types of financial instruments and
sets out the proposed treatment for the financial assets and financial
liabilities so created, in the accounts of the respective enterprises.
A financial instrument in this context is a contract that gives rise to
both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or
equity instrument of another enterprise. Financial instruments include
both primary instruments such as cash, receivables and equity
securities, and secondary or derivative instruments, such as options,
futures and forward contracts relating to financial instruments and
interest-rate and currency swaps. Various interests, such as those in
associates and subsidiaries and commodity contracts, were excluded from
E40. The new draft also proposed to exclude from the scope of the
Standard insurance contracts and assets held specifically to provide
funds for satisfying obligations under insurance contracts.

Other significant changes from E40 include:

* the criteria for recognising and subsequently discontinuing
recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability now refers to
the transfer of substantially all of the risks and rewards associated
with the asset or liability;

* a legally enforceable right of set-off must exist before a financial
asset may be offset against a financial liability and the net amount
included in the balance sheet;

* impaired monetary financial assets and impaired non-monetary
financial assets are now treated separately under the Standard ;

* hedge accounting is now permitted for price risk exposure where
expected future positions are highly likely to materialize;

* financial instruments that hedge currency (foreign exchange) risk are
now within the scope of the hedge accounting requirements of the
Standard.

ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATY

The coming into force of the European Economic Area (EEA) Treaty on
January 1 1994 led to substantial changes in the regulation of many
commercial areas in Norway, including the regulation of financial
markets.

The changes relate both to the implementation in Norway of the general
principles of EEA law, like for example non-discrimination of EEA
nationals, and the implementation of the various EC Directives relating
to financial markets. There follows an overview of some of the changes
relating to both banking and investment business.

Banking
The Norwegian regulations contained various provisions regarding
nationality and residence of persons acting as board members of a bank
and the founders of a bank. Originally these persons had to be
Norwegian nationals and resident in Norway. These requirements have
been changed to cover persons who are nationals of an EEA state and
resident in such a state. The restrictions on foreign ownership of
Norwegian banks remain applicable since Norway can, according to the
EEA Treaty, benefit from a transitional period for its investment
controls until January 1 1995 when it has to lift its restrictions in
respect of EEA nationals.

The various EC Banking Directives have been implemented in Norway,
including the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive as a result of
which EEA Member State banks may provide services to, and establish
branches in Norway. The services provided for, relate to the taking of
deposits as well as the services set out in the Annex to the Directive.
The relevant regulations open possibilities for the imposition of
various rules on these branches to the extent that they are necessary
for the public good, as provided for in the Directive.

The Norwegian regulations in respect of banking activities have also
been amended in other respects to comply with the various EC banking
directives including regulations in respect of consumer credits and
money laundering.

Investment
As far as intermediaries are concerned, the rules now provide an
exemption for branches of EEA credit institutions in Norway to conduct
their securities activities through a separate legal entity. Norwegian
banks are under an obligation to organise their securities market
business in a separate legal entity. The activities must also be
separated physically from the other activities of the bank. Branches of
EEA credit institutions do not have to comply with these rules. The
legislation further provides a basis for the adoption of additional
requirements on EEA credit institutions offering securities services
through a branch in Norway.

In addition, the obligation on Norwegian residents to make purchases of
foreign securities through a Norwegian broker has also been amended.
The rules now provide that Norwegian residents can buy and sell
securities which are regularly traded in the EEA without the mediation
of a Norwegian securities broker. In addition, these securities no
longer need to be kept in the securities deposit of a Norwegian bank or
securities broker. Although the exemptions are mainly directed to
securities traded in EEA member states, the regulations also provide
that the exemptions can be made applicable to securities traded in
states which have supervisory standards similar to those of the EEA.

The listing requirements of the Oslo Stock Exchange have been amended
to comply with the various directives in this field, including the
rules in connection with the preparation and recognition of
prospectuses. The Norwegian regulations in connection with the offering
of non-listed securities have also been amended.

If the securities to be issued have a value of more than 5 million
krone and the offer is directed to more than 50 persons, then the
issuer has to prepare a prospectus which complies with detailed
requirements. The prospectus must be sent to the board of the Oslo
Stock Exchange, where the contents of the prospectus will be checked in
order to ensure that they comply with the relevant regulations. If the
securities are listed on an EEA stock exchange, a similar prospectus
needs to be prepared if the value of the issue is more than 300,000
krone or if the offer is directed to more than 50 persons.

Different prospectus requirements apply to issues which are directed to
more than 50 persons and have a value of between 300,000 krone and 5
million krone. In such cases, a less elaborate prospectus will need to
be prepared. The prospectus must also be sent to the board of the Oslo
Stock Exchange, however this is for filing purposes only. There are a
number of exemptions to these prospectus requirements which should also
be considered.

In addition, there are more general rules in connection with
invitations to subscribe or the corresponding acquisition of shares in
connection with the incorporation of a company or capital increases,
founder shares and bonds with a term of more than 12 months. In such
cases a prospectus must be prepared which complies with some basic
requirements. These rules apply only to the extent that a prospectus is
required pursuant to, for example, company law or when a prospectus is
issued in connection with the issue.

The regulations relating to investment institutions have been amended
and now also incorporate the UCITS Directive.

OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS

Since the beginning of March, options on futures contracts have been
quoted on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time on an
"experimental" basis. The wording of a standard contract for these
instruments is currently being settled by the management committees of
the "Mif" (Government Bond futures exchange) and by the "Mts" (the
Government on-screen trading market). It is expected that regular
trading will commence in earnest sometime in April 1994.

The underlying instruments will be futures contracts on ten-year
Treasury Bonds (BTp decennali) and will be based on the American model
(ie exercisable at any time from the date of purchase to the date of
exercise). There will be nine striking prices, exercisable at fifty
base-point intervals, and the premium will be payable upon maturity of
the option or upon its exercise.

In order to ensure the efficient management of the new instruments, the
Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (the national clearing house) entered
into a contract last August with the Options Clearing Corporation in
Chicago for the supply of specialised software which will also be used
for the other new products which are shortly to be introduced onto the
market, namely three-month Eurolira futures and stock exchange index-
linked futures.

SUPER PRIMARY DEALERS

In March, a Decree Law of the Ministry of Treasury introduced a new
player in the Italian markets namely, the "Super Primary Dealer", who
will operate in both the Italian primary and secondary markets in
Treasury Bonds.

The "Super Primary Dealer" is a Primary Dealer who is able to satisfy
certain strict pre-requisites (in particular, it must have assets worth
at least Lit. 75 billion, and have been awarded a market share
calculated on the basis of a year's trading, equal to at least one per
cent in respect of each category of bonds and no less than three per
cent of the of total volume of Treasury Bonds issued on the primary
market over the same period). Super Primary Dealers are expected to be
effective marketmakers and it is worth noting that they will have
access to certain Treasury Bonds auctions at which only Super Primary
Dealers will be permitted to bid.
