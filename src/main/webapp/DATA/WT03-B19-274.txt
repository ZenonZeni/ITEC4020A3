<P>
Historically, the Wimmera around Horsham is recognised for its
efficient primary production and spectacular tourist destinations
such as the Grampians National Park.
<P>
More than 80 per cent of Victoria's cereal crops are grown in
the Wimmera-Mallee, and the south-west of Victoria is the state's
biggest wool and sheep producer.
<P>
While sheep grazing remains the area's most important pastoral
activity, recent discoveries of mineral sands near Horsham could
see the creation of a major minerals industry.

<H2>Mineral sands</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/horsh1.gif" align=right>
Wimmera Industrial Minerals (WIM, a subsidiary of CRA) has discovered
one of the world's largest known reserves of mineral sands in
the district - including rutile, ilmenite, zircon and other minerals.
<P>
Following extensive research, WIM has made a commercial decision
to defer mineral sand mining and possible downstream processing
until the end of this decade. Commercial mineral sands mining
and processing remains a great opportunity for industrial development.
<H2>Agricultural value adding</H2>

<P>
Potential exists for downstream processing of local agricultural
produce, such as oil seed processing and refining, wool processing,
seed cleaning, legume processing, intensive feedlots, paper pulp,
strawboard cereal processing and breakfast cereal foods.
<P>
The Wimmera Development Association makes extensive data, information
and assistance available to companies interested in agricultural
downstream processing in the Horsham District.
<H2>Administrative centre</H2>

<P>
Horsham is strategically situated on the main rail and road routes
linking Melbourne and Adelaide. The Western Highway is the main
artery through the Wimmera, and the Henty Highway connects the
main centres in south-western Victoria including Hamilton, Warrnambool
and Portland.
<P>
Horsham is the administrative capital of central-western Victoria.
It is surrounded by Dimboola, Dunmunkle, Kaniva and Warracknabeal,
all of which possess excellent supporting infrastructures.
<P>
Horsham is well serviced with a quality water supply for irrigation,
stock and domestic use. Excess water supply capacity is available
for new industries.
<P>
The city's present infrastructure (water and sewerage) could support
an increase in population of eight thousand.
<P>
Horsham and District also offers future employees educational
facilities. Apart from providing comprehensive primary and secondary
schooling (both public and private), Horsham is the base for the
Wimmera Community College of Technical and Further Education (TAFE),
which has close links with the University of Ballarat. The district
has the state's largest concentration of agricultural research
and educational institutions.
<P>
The individual municipalities in the Wimmera actively encourage
and compete for industry and offer various forms of industry establishment
assistance.


<H2>Industrial estates maximise opportunities</H2>

<P>
Two industrial estates in Horsham provide 206 hectares of serviced
land. All municipalities within the Wimmera have land for industrial
estates.
<P>
The Wimmera Development Association is planning a Wimmera centre
for sustainable resource-based industrial development. The proposal
is to develop nearly two hundred hectares, including some land
set aside for purchase by resource-based industries.
<P>
Cereals, legumes and oil seeds are the main crops. They provide
opportunities for food processing industries to establish themselves
close to their primary source.
<P>
Although agriculture is by far the largest employer, manufacturers
also operate in Horsham. The largest is the Holeproof factory,
employing 120, and Vulcan Australia's repetition iron foundry
is another major employer.
<P>
In the wider Wimmera region, particularly in the Lowan area, many
medium-sized manufacturers employ between ten and sixty people.
These industries cover a cross section of engineering, cereal
production and meat and poultry processing.
<H2>Great outdoors offers tourism potential</H2>

<P>
The district's tourism industry has great potential for further
development. Apart from indoor and outdoor recreation facilities,
the Wimmera has a variety of pursuits for visitors and residents.
<P>
Recreation facilities include valuable tourist and conservation
resources. These include the Grampians National Park, Mt Arapiles/Tooan
State Park, and the wilderness. The surrounding forests offer
opportunities for bushwalking, orienteering, canoeing, fishing,
hunting, fossicking, picnics, horse riding, boating, trail bike
riding and pleasure drives.
