Clipper: Love your country, don't trust its government <p>

[... Further comment after noting the CIA story:] <p>

So, you can buy a high ranking CIA person (who ran the *counter*intelligence
branch for 2 years) for a measly $1.5 million.  I wonder how much a pair of
Clipper-key-escrow agency people will cost? <p>
