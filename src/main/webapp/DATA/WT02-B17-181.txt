<h2>Hawaii Biomass Gasifier Project</h2>
<img border=0 hspace=20 vspace=5 align=left src="images/hawaii.gif">
<b>Project Summary</b>

<p>The Hawaii Biomass Gasifier project is part of a major U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) initiative to demonstrate 
high-efficiency gasification systems for converting renewable 
biomass resources into electricity.  This project will provide a 
near-term demonstration integrating gasification and hot-gas 
cleanup (HGCU) components with gas turbines for power generation.  
The project is a 50/50 cost-shared effort that will significantly 
buy-down the perceived private sector risk associated with the 
deployment of biomass gasification power systems, while producing 
power at cost-competitive rates.

<p>The objective of the Hawaii project is to scale-up the pilot 
10-ton/day Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) Renugas&#174; 
pressurized air/oxygen gasifier to an engineering development unit 
that can handle 50 to 100 tons/day of bagasse (sugar cane residue) 
and wood as fuel.

<p><b>FY 1996 Products</b>

<p>Fabrication of the integrated gasifier and turbine assembly 
will be completed in FY 1996.  The integrated turbine system 
should be operational in the third quarter of 1997.
<p>
<b>Payoffs</b>

<p>Demonstration of this U.S. technology will provide significant 
market opportunities for advanced-cycle, high-efficiency biomass 
power generation systems, with applications in both domestic and 
international markets.  Since this demonstration is at an existing 
sugar mill, it will also provide access to the international sugar 
mill refurbishment market.  Verification of the performance of the 
gasifier, gas turbines and HGCU systems will facilitate the 
expansion of markets for these component-based units.

This project also leverages investments made by DOE's Fossil 
Energy (FE) Program through their coal gasification research and 
development activities.  Westinghouse's involvement with the 
biomass gasification/HGCU work allows them to build upon their 
extensive experience gained through FE's coal gasification program.

<p><b>Status</b>

<p>The scale-up will be completed in several phases.  Phase 1, 
which is now under way, consists of the design, construction, and 
preliminary operation of the gasifier to generate hot, unprocessed 
gas which will be flared.  The gasifier is being designed to 
operate with either air oxygen at pressures up to 300 psia, at 
typical operating temperatures of 850&#176; to 900&#176;C.   In 
Phase 2, during 1995, the gasifier will be operated at a feed rate 
of 50 tons/day at a maximum pressure of 150 psia, and a 
slip-stream HGCU unit will be installed to provide a long-term 
evaluation of its performance.  At the same time, the necessary 
design  and environmental permitting will be completed for the 
succeeding full-scale HGCU and gas turbine operation.  The turbine 
may utilize some supplementary fuel to obtain an output that would 
permit commercial operation after the demonstration period is 
completed.  Following the end of Phase 1 in mid-1996, a full-scale 
HGCU unit and gas turbine will be added to the system to generate 
3-5 MW of electricity.  In this phase (Phase 2), the gasifier feed 
rate will be 100 tons/day; and the system will operate at 
pressures up to 300 psia.  In Phase 3, the system will be operated 
in an oxygen-blown mode to produce a clean syngas for methanol 
synthesis, in addition to producing electricity.

<p><b>Partners</b>

<p>Participants in the project are Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation in Orlando, FL; IGT in Chicago, IL; the Pacific 
International center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) in 
Maui, HI; the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) in Maui, HI; 
the Hawaii Commercial and Sugar Company (HC&S) in Maui, HI; and 
the Ralph M. Parsons Company, the architectural and engineering 
firm for the project, which is also in Maui, HI.  The gasifier is 
installed at the HC&S sugar mill at Paia, Maui, Hawaii.  
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NRL) is providing 
project oversight in addition to systems analysis.

<p><b>Cost Share</b>

<p>Industry and the State of Hawaii have contributed $4.2 million 
to the first phase, with DOE contributing $6.0 million.  In the 
second phase, negotiations are underway for both the State of 
Hawaii and industry to cost share approximately 50/50 with DOE.

<p><b>Related Programs</b>

<p>The Biomass Gasifier Facility is an integral part of the 
overall Biomass Power Program strategy, which is managed under 
DOE's Office of Utility Technologies.  The core Biomass Power 
Program mainly operates in the technology validation and 
assessment area and support the initial development and deployment 
of the HGCU tecnology through a contract with Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation.  Westinghouse is the prime contractor on the 
above contract with IGT, Gilbert Commonwealth, and PICHTR as 
lower-tier contractors.  The current program encompasses the 
design, construction, and evaluation of high-temperature ceramic 
filter technology for the cleanup of hot-gas streams from biomass 
gasification prior to its use in gas turbines.

<p>The Biofuels Systems Program, under DOE's Office of 
Transportation Technologies, is developing liquid fuels from 
biomass with a strong emphasis on the use of biotechnology to 
produce ethanol from lignocellulosics.  As such, the technology 
development and validation to be accomplished under this 
program directly benefits the Biofuels Program as well.

<p><b>Vulnerabilities and Issues</b>

<p>The major vulnerability is international competition, since 
advanced biomass power technology offers a substantial worldwide 
market potential (it could increase, by a factor of 5, the 
electric power output of sugar industries and pulp and paper 
facilities worldwide).  Currently, there are several 
commercialization activities underway in North America, Brazil, 
and Scandinavia.  Two prominent international development 
(the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility Gasifier Project 
in Brazil, and the Varnarmo Bioflo project in Sweden) indicate 
that European biomass gasification technologies are also close to 
commercial demonstration, which could provide direct international 
competition for this developing market.  It is cricial that U.S. 
technologies not lose out to foreign competition in this vast area 
of market opportunity.  As such, further development, 
demonstration and deployment of this technology could be 
jeopardized should DOE funding for these Biomass Power projects be 
reduced.
