Significant progress has been made with our major research project. Two of our <BR>
PGY-IV residents, Randall Marshall, M.D. and Susan Vaughan, M.D., have used their PGY-IV elective time to collaborate with Steven Roose, M.D. and Roger MacKinnon, M.D. to develop a protocol for a feasibility study to evaluate the possibility of a major prospective outcome study, possibly multi-centered.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The research help and guidance from some of the department's most outstanding clinical investigators has made this project possible. Ronald Rieder, M.D., in particular, has helped and, with his support, both Dr. Marshall and Dr. Vaughan have obtained research fellowships that will allow them to devote significant time to this project. The Center is very grateful to the Psychiatric Institute faculty who are helping with our research effort. The Executive Committee of the Center has endorsed the project with its multiple rating scales, independent raters, and audiotaping of sessions. Thus far, nine psychoanalytic cases have accepted the study. The Center is supporting the inclusion of a parallel group of long-term analytic psychotherapy cases treated by residents under the supervision of Lisa Mellman, M.D. and our supervisory faculty. We have obtained a small grant from the Dorgan Fund to support most of the expenses.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1993, the Center, in collaboration with the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine, established the Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Division, an advanced course in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy for clinical psychiatrists who have recently completed training. The program was developed by Roger MacKinnon, M.D., Don Meyers, M.D., and Fred Kass, M.D. The course, which meets one evening per week for one year, is designed as a skills enhancing experience for those psychiatrists who are uncertain about formal psychoanalytic training, who have ruled out such training because of other career commitments, or who seek additional supervision and course work in psychotherapy.
