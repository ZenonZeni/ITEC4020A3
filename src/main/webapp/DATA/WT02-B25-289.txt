<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Policy-makers:  Points of View</H2>
<H4>An interview with Steven E. Hyman, M.D.
</H4></font>
<hr>
<I>Note:  This interview with Steven E. Hyman, M.D., director of the 
National Institute of Mental Health, was conducted by Laura Lee 
Hall, Ph.D., NAMI deputy director of policy and research. 
</I><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	Now that you have been the NIMH director for several months, 
what changes, if any, do you have in mind for NIMH in the near 
term and in the longer term?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font>	My near-term and long-term goals are similar:  ensuring that 
we fund the most promising science to advance our 
understanding of mental illness, improve treatment and service 
delivery, and ultimately lead to effective preventive 
strategies.  My priorities include an increasing focus on 
research in neuroscience, in genetics, and in the pathogenesis 
and treatment of serious mental disorders.  Within that broad 
plan, I already have set in motion several initiatives.  Let 
me illustrate with some specifics. 
<P>
	Many of our approaches to genetics were initiated when the 
complexity of the inherited vulnerability to mental disorders 
was not fully grasped.  Now that we recognize that 
"vulnerability" genes interact with environmental "second 
hits" to produce serious mental disorders, now that we 
understand that there may be more than one genetic pathway for 
vulnerability to mood disorders or schizophrenia, now that we 
understand that even in a single individual multiple genes may 
interact to produce vulnerability, it is evident that we need 
to update our strategies.  In particular, we need to take 
advantage of the rapid technological advances pioneered by the 
human genome project.  Accordingly, I have initiated a rapid 
and focused review of our investment in genetics so that we 
can better direct our resources toward finding genes that 
confer vulnerability to disorders such as schizophrenia, manic 
depressive illness, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, and autism.  
<P>
	Similarly, I have initiated a review of our investment in 
research on mood disorders.  I am concerned that we may not 
have enough of an investment in clinical trials while perhaps 
we still invest too much in human physiologic investigations 
using older approaches that are not informed by modern 
understandings of the brain.  This review should improve the 
quality of our portfolio in mood disorders and may identify 
new areas for research funding.  
<P>
	NIMH must adhere scrupulously to the principle that our 
research must be dictated by public health need and by a 
realistic opportunity for scientific progress.  Given our 
budgetary limits, we cannot continue to support research in 
areas that have outlived their usefulness.  Nor can we fail to 
invest in treatment and outcomes research because some of the 
research community finds these less "sexy" than, for example, 
neuroimaging studies.  The reviews I will be instituting are 
not geared toward producing glossy documents; rather, I want 
clear-eyed examinations of our investment with recommendations 
for implementation.  This is the type of mechanism that I will 
use--once we have gotten some experience with it--to update 
our successful long-term national plans in such important 
areas as schizophrenia research and childhood mental 
disorders.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	As you know, NAMI has become increasingly concerned that 
NIMH's research portfolio has become too expansive and has 
lost its focus on severe mental disorders.  What do you see as 
NIMH's primary mission in terms of the kinds of research it 
funds, and what criteria do you think should be in place for 
deciding the kinds of research that should be funded?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font>	If we look at the changes in the mission and research 
portfolio of the NIMH over the past two decades, the institute 
has in fact become progressively more focussed on severe 
mental disorders--in marked contrast to the institute of 
twenty years ago, which was involved in broad efforts in 
community mental health, in mental health promotion, or in the 
development of mental health service delivery.  This movement 
toward a focus on mental illness culminated in the return of 
NIMH to the National Institutes of Health, the world's 
premiere biomedical research organization.
<P>
	I plan to further strengthen this commitment to research on 
severe mental illnesses and to the basic sciences necessary 
for progress on these illnesses.  Particularly in the current 
budget climate, we need to be quite clear about our priorities 
and be guided by two primary considerations:  scientific 
opportunities and public health need.  Public health need 
dictates that our greatest commitment should be research 
focused on serious mental disorders.  We are fortunate that 
there are now unprecedented scientific tools that will hasten 
progress in these areas.  I am in the process of analyzing our 
entire research portfolio, not only to consider mission 
relevance, but also the quality of the science.  This effort 
has earned the explicit support of the Congress and a request 
that I brief Congress on our findings, which I find very 
encouraging.  
<P>
	NAMI has appropriately emphasized the need for research on 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic depressive 
illness, severe depression, and anxiety disorders.  We must 
not forget other severe and disabling mental disorders, 
however, including some disorders of childhood, severe eating 
disorders such as anorexia, severe personality disorders, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, and mental disorders of aging. 
 Congress has, in fact, encouraged research in many of these 
areas.  Similarly, we must remain committed to the support of 
basic science, which may not have obvious initial 
relationships to mental illness, because history has shown 
that we often cannot predict at the outset the ultimate 
implications or relevance of basic-science endeavors.  
Fortunately, all of my interactions with NAMI membership and 
staff have reassured me that there is no more sophisticated 
advocacy group when it comes to understanding the need for 
basic neuroscience research, and I believe that we will forge 
an even stronger alliance on behalf of both applied and basic 
research to benefit those with mental illness.  
<P>
	There is one other issue I would like to address.  NAMI has 
expressed concern about some of the basic behavioral research 
that we fund.  I believe that closer links between behavioral 
research and neuroscience are necessary.  And I intend to work 
to ensure that the behavioral research we support will have an 
immediate or longer-term impact on our understanding of these 
illnesses, on treatment, or on the delivery of services for 
mental illness.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	NIMH funds research spanning from very basic science to 
clinical research and services research. You yourself have 
spoken about improving the translation of basic-research 
findings into clinical advances and actual treatment in the 
service system.  Can you describe your views concerning these 
three general areas of research, how they interact, and how we 
can foster scientific advances that will translate as rapidly 
as possible into better care for people with serious brain 
disorders?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font>	NIMH does indeed fund research that extends from molecules to 
services.  A general problem in science, not limited to 
research in mental illness, is found in the extremely 
specialized languages and research tools used by investigators 
in different areas of science.  These languages and research 
tools are required for rapid progress at any given level of 
analysis; however, that specialization creates a problem in 
the translation from one area to another.  The term 
translational research was initially coined in the realm of 
cancer research, but is quite relevant to our concerns as 
well.  We must encourage a subset of our scientists to focus 
on the boundaries between basic science and clinical research 
and, for that matter, between clinical research and services 
research.  We must hasten the movement of new discoveries into 
the clinic.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	You know that NAMI has been an ardent supporter of NIMH.  But 
beyond lobbying for more funding for the institute, NAMI 
desires a greater voice in administrative and policy decisions 
at NIMH.  What role do you believe that citizens--people with 
serious brain disorders and their families--should play at 
NIMH?  How will you go about involving citizens in your 
efforts?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font> </font>	I am aware that the support for biomedical research in the 
United States stems from the needs of people suffering with 
illness and from their families and from the overall benefit 
to society of restoring those disabled by illness to 
productivity.  There is no place for arrogance among 
scientists.  We must have serious and open dialogues with all 
of our constituency groups.  NAMI plays a central role in 
advocacy for research on serious brain disorders; and I plan 
to involve NAMI, along with other constituencies, in our 
efforts in several ways.  First, I have encouraged all members 
of our National Advisory Mental Health Council--non-
scientists and scientists alike--to play a full and vital 
role in our policy decisions.  I was fortunate to have the 
opportunity to nominate Dale Johnson, former NAMI president 
and a very knowledgeable person, to our council.  I am also 
developing plans to convene our different constituency groups 
on a regular basis to discuss areas of mutual concern and 
interest.  
<P>
My near-term and long-term goals are similar:  ensuring that we 
fund the most promising science to advance our understanding of 
mental illness, improve treatment and service delivery, and 
ultimately lead to effective preventive strategies.
<P>
Particularly in the current budget climate, we need to be quite 
clear about our priorities and be guided by two primary 
considerations:  scientific opportunities and public health need.
<P>
Fortunately, all of my interactions with NAMI membership and staff 
have reassured me that there is no more sophisticated advocacy 
group when it comes to understanding the need for basic 
neuroscience research, and I believe that we will forge an even 
stronger alliance on behalf of both applied and basic research to 
benefit those with mental illness.
