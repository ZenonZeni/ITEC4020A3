<P><strong>Program Structure</strong><p>DOE Laboratories Spearhead 

the National Wind Energy Program<p>The Wind/Hydro/Ocean Division of 

DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy manages the 

National Wind Energy Program.  The division is responsible for 

ensuring that program activities are consistent with national 

energy policy, priorities, and directives.  DOE’s field offices and 

national laboratories implement program activities, including 

subcontracts with utilities, industry, and academia.  The agreements 

with utilities and industry are designed to foster the development of 

new wind energy technologies and accelerate their commercialization.  

University subcontracts help build the wind energy technology base.  The 

FY 1994 Wind Energy Program budget was $30.3 million.

<a href="http://nwtc.nrel.gov">The National Renewable Energy 

Laboratory</a>, located in Golden, Colorado, is the world’s largest 

scientific institution dedicated to developing renewable energy 

technologies.  As DOE’s lead laboratory in wind technology development , 

NREL operates the National Wind Technology Center.  NREL manages DOE’s 

cooperative government/industry programs, including wind turbine 

development, utility programs, and industry programs.  NREL also 

manages international and applied research programs, conducting 

research in structures and fatigue testing, wind characterization, 

aerodynamics, advanced components and systems, and wind resource 

assessments.

<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/wind_energy/homepage.html">

Sandia National Laboratories</a>, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 

and Livermore, California, has been involved in renewable energy 

technologies, including wind, for more than 20 years.  Sandia’s wind 

program focuses on both industry/utility issues and applied research.  

As part of the industry-driven Wind Turbine Development Program Sandia 

is leading an Advanced Manufacturing initiative to reduce turbine costs 

through innovative component manufacturing. Applied research activities 

emphasize the development, validation, and transfer to industry of 

analytical and experimental tools in the areas of aerodynamics, 

structural dynamics, fatigue, reliability, materials, and controls.
