<A NAME="Reach">
<H3>I.  Requirements to Reach Candidacy
</H3>
</A>
	The following courses and exams are required of all students in
order to reach candidacy:
<P>
<OL TYPE="A">	
<LI><B>Mathematics and statistics courses</B>:  All students must receive
at least a B- in each of Econ 653, 654, 673, and 674.  A student can place
out of any of these course requirements, however, by passing a placement
exam at the beginning of the relevant course during the student's first
year in the program.
<P>
<LI><B>Core theory courses</B>:  Normally, each student will take Econ
601, 602, 603, and 604 during the first year in the program.  Students
with additional time commitments, e.g. due to English language courses or
GSI responsibilities, may be allowed by the Director of Graduate Studies to
postpone Econ 602 and Econ 604 until their second year in the program. 
Students are required to pass a prelim in each area of theory by May one
year after the relevant coursework is completed.  If a student has still
not passed a theory prelim by this May, but has passed the other theory
prelim by that date, then that student will be allowed one more chance
during the following September.  <EM>However, if a student's GPA at the 
end of the first year is below 5.0, then in order to remain in the 
program that student must pass by September starting the second year all 
theory prelims for which the relevant coursework was completed during the 
first year.</EM> 
<P>
	Students are required to take Econ 601-604 for credit and cannot
register for a theory prelim until the associated course work has been
completed.  The only time a student can take a theory prelim without
having taken for credit the two associated theory courses is in May of the
first year or September of the second year.  If a student does so, then
the prelim must be passed by September of the second year to remain in the
program.  If the prelim is passed, then the requirement to take the
associate courses for credit is waived.
<P>

<LI><B>Major fields</B>:  Each student is required to pass a prelim in
each of two major fields.  Prelims can be taken each May and September. 
Normal preparation for each prelim is a two-course sequence in that field. 
<EM>Both prelims must be passed by May of the student's fourth year in the
program.</EM>
<P>

<LI><B>Other course requirements</B>:  
<OL TYPE="1">	<P>
    <LI>Each student must receive at least a B- in a course in a third
    "minor" field.
    <P>
    <LI> Each student must take two "cognate" courses, which are courses
    (approved for graduate credit) in another department of the University. 
    These courses can be cross-listed in the Economics department.
    <P>
    <LI>One of the student's three fields (the two major and one
    minor) must be either <I>Advanced Theory</I> or <I>Econometrics</I>.
</OL>
<P>
<LI><B>Available Fields</B>:  The current list of approved fields consists of:
 Advanced Theory, Economic History, Econometric Theory, Industrial
Organization, International Economics, Labor Economics, Monetary Theory,
Population Studies, Public Finance, and Transition Economics.  If the
Department, due to staffing limitations, is able to offer only one course
in a field, then that field can only be used to satisfy the "minor" field
requirement.  If no courses are offered, then that field cannot be used to
satisfy Departmental requirements.  However, when a course in one of these
fields is not offered, the Director of Graduate Studies, in consultation
with members of the relevant field, has the power to approve an
alternative course, taught outside the Department, or approve a reading
course with one of the members of the Department.
<P>
	While the Department discourages use of other fields, a student
may petition the Director of Graduate Studies to substitute a field not
included in the above list.  To do so, the following procedure must be
followed for a major field:

<OL TYPE="1">	<P>
    <LI>Two faculty members in the Economics Department must be found
    to sponsor the field.
    
    <LI>These faculty members should, together with the student, draw
    up a reading list appropriate for a two-course sequence in the proposed
    field.  In some cases, these courses may be based on regular courses
    offered outside the Department, supplemented where appropriate.
    
    <LI>These faculty members should agree to supervise these two courses,
    and agree to write and grade a preliminary exam in the field.
    
    <LI>The student should submit the reading list to the Director of
    Graduate Studies, along with a one-page petition describing why this
    alternative field is important for the student's education.
    
    <LI>This material will be circulated to all members of the Graduate
    Program Committee.  Unless objections are received from a majority of the
    members within a month, the petition will be approved.  Otherwise, the
    student can meet with the committee to try to convince a majority to
    approve it.
</OL>
<P>
	For a proposed minor field, the same rules should be followed,
except that only one faculty member is needed, and there would be no
prelim.
<P>
<LI><B>Teaching and research experience</B>:  Each student is required to
spend the equivalent of one year in a half-time teaching or research
assistant position.
</OL>

<A NAME="After">
<H3>II.  Requirements after Reaching Candidacy</H3>
</A>

<OL TYPE="A">	
<LI><B>Third year paper</B>:  All Ph.D. students are required to enroll
in Econ 695-696 during their third year.  In these courses, each student
is expected to complete a research paper of "publishable quality" with the
assistance of an assigned faculty supervisor.  The paper should be no more
than twenty-five pages long.  Each paper must be approved by two faculty
supervisors, on a pass/fail basis.  If the supervisors disagree on the
grading as of September of the student's fourth year or later, then the
student can ask the Director of Graduate Studies to appoint a third reader
whose word is final.  A failed paper can be revised and resubmitted, but
only three separate submissions of a paper will be considered.<P>

<LI><B>Seminar registration</B>:  All 4+ year students are required to 
enroll for one of the field seminars are are encouraged to enroll at the 
earliest possible time when their schedules permit.  Students registered 
in a seminar should participate actively in the seminar to merit course 
credit and are urged to present their own research to the seminar.  The 
specific requirements for each seminar will be chosen by the faculty 
running that seminar.  When students in 4+ find it difficult to register 
due to financial constraints or conflicts with other course commitments, 
they must seek a waiver from the Director of Graduate Studies. <P>

<LI><B>Proposal defense</B>:  Each student must successfully defend a
thesis proposal before a committee approved by the thesis chairman,
preferably including four faculty members.  A student must have
successfully defended a proposal to be ranked in Group 1 for GSI
eligibility in a student's fifth year, to be ranked in Group 2 in the
student's sixth year, and to be ranked in Group 3 in later years.<P>

<LI><B>Final thesis defense</B>:  If the final thesis defense occurs more
than seven years after the student first enrolled in the Department, then
the Director of Graduate Studies must approve the awarding of a degree.<P>

<H3>III.  Rules for Assignment of Graduate Student Instructors</H3>
</A>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><B>Eligibility for a GSI assignment</B>:  
<P>
<OL TYPE="1">	
    <LI>All students <I>must</I> enroll for the required GSI training course
    during the first term of employment or become ineligible for a GSI
    assignment during the subsequent term until the training has been
    completed.  Students who have taken the CRLT International GSI
    workshop are <I>not</I> exempted from this requirement.
    <P>
    <LI> Foreign-born students who currently have a score on the ELI exam of
    4- on the grading scale of 1-5 are ineligible for a GSI assignment.
    <P>
    <LI>Foreign-born students scoring 4- on the ELI exam must obtain a
    4P rating from CRLT's IGSI workshop to be eligible for a GSI assignment. 
    All that is promised is that among students with a 4P rating, we will
    attempt to assign in priority order.
    <P>
    <LI>Students must have passed the theory prelim for any courses
    taken in their first year by May of their second year in order to be
    eligible to teach in the fall of their third year.
    <P>
    <LI>Students must have passed all theory prelims by May of their
    third year in order to teach in the fall of their fourth year.  
    <P>
    <LI>Students who are required to pass a theory prelim in September
    of their 2nd or 3rd year in order to remain in the Ph.D. program are
    ineligible for GSI assignments in the fall semester of that year.
    <P>
    <LI>Students who did not submit an acceptable third-year paper by
    May of their fourth year are ineligible for a GSI assignment.  
    <P>
    <LI>Students who have received from LSA at least tuition plus a
    quarter-time stipend for a teaching or research assistant position during
    at least ten semesters, not including spring or summer, are no longer
    eligible for a GSI assignment.
    <P>
    
    <LI>If a student has taught at least twice and the student's latest 
    average teaching evaluation score on question 298 ("Overall, my 
    [graduate student] instructor is an excellent teacher") is below 
    2.75, he or she cannot teach the next semester, and can teach after 
    that only if they have participated in some approved CRLT training.  
    (First-time GSIs are exempt from this rule during their first 
    semester teaching.)  If a student has any evaluation score
    lower than 3.00 in any section in the previous semester, the GSI must
    accept the supervision of CRLT personnel to continue teaching in the
    subsequent semester.  The most recent TA rankings will be used to
    determine any term's GSI assignment.  GSIs with an average ranking below
    3.00 who do not accept CRLT supervision will not be assigned a GSI
    position.
    <P>

    <LI>Students whose latest TA evaluation is below 3.00, or who have not
    taught before, are ineligible to teach during the spring or summer
    semesters.
    <P>
    <LI>In response to severe complaints about a GSI from the faculty
    member in the course, a GSI may be disallowed from teaching the following
    semester, or allowed to teach only with the assistance of CRLT personnel. 
    When a faculty member is unhappy about the performance of a TA, the first
    step will be to inform the GSI of the nature of the problem in 
    writing, so that the GSI has a chance to rectify the problem.  The 
    faculty member should also inform the Graduate Chair and the 
    instructors in the Department's GSI training course.  If the problem 
    is severe enough, current GEO rules provide for remedies during the 
    semester.  In any case, if the faculty member recommends that the GSI 
    not be allowed to teach the following semester, the case will go to 
    an ad hoc committee composed of the Graduate Chair, the Associate 
    Chair, and the instructors in the Department's GSI training course.
    <P>
    <LI>Students with a GPA below 5.00 are ineligible to be GSIs.
    <P>
    <LI>GSIs assigned to Economics 101 and 102 are required to attend
    all staff meetings and lab training sessions in addition to meeting
    scheduled sections, lecture section, and office hours.  The GSI will be
    warned only once and if these obligations are not met and problems
    continue, as determined by the faculty in charge of the course, the
    student will be ineligible to be hired for a term.
    <P>
    <LI>All other applicants are eligible.
