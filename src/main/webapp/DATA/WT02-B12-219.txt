The purpose of Migration Dialogue is to promote among opinion

leaders an off-the-record discussion of the major immigration

and integration issues likely to face the industrial democracies.

Three-day seminars are held in places that allow participants

during field trips to discuss with immigrants, service providers,

and others the day-to-day issues involved in dealing with immigration

and integration.

and

<P>

<U>Discussion questions</U>: When two distinct groups share a

geographic area, two extremes delineate their possible interaction--integration

or assimilation (eliminating boundaries between groups, encouraging

convergence in language, values, earnings etc.) and pluralism

or multiculturalism (encouraging maintenance of cultural diversity,

tolerating or welcoming enclaves). These are sometimes referred

to as the &quot;melting pot&quot; versus the &quot;salad bowl&quot;

approaches to accommodating immigrants.<BR>


<P>

1. What relationships can be identified between the patterns of

immigration and the integration experiences of immigrants? For

example, how do the numbers and origins of immigrants affect their

integration experiences? Does it matter for integration if immigration

flows from the same countries are continuous vs. fluctuating?


<P>

2. In countries of immigration such as the United States, and

in cities such as Chicago, what were the major factors that contributed

to the successful integration of large numbers of immigrants:

economic growth; policies favoring integration; and/or institutions

such as public schools, churches, unions, political parties, and

the military? What was the Americanization movement, what impacts

did it have on integration, and why is it criticized by some today?


<P>

3. How do the integration policies of European countries, and

of Canada and Australia, differ from those of the United States?


<P>

4. Are there trade-offs between immigration and integration policy?

For example, if a high proportion of immigrants enter under nuclear

or extended-family unification criteria, does this contribute

to or limit successful integration? Does it matter for integration

if immigrants are co-ethnics relocating to the &quot;mother country&quot;;

intending temporary vs. permanent immigrants; culturally/linguistically/racially/religiously

distinct from the receiving country's population? Is it easier

to successfully integrate a large immigrant population from the

same national/ethnic origin, or do diverse origins accelerate

integration? 

<P>

5. For purposes of integration, how important are underlying conditions

such as the labor market; the housing market; residential segregation

vs. dispersion; effectiveness of public education systems; etc.?

<P>

<U>Discussion questions</U>: The focus in this session is on native

reactions to immigrants. How do the perceptions of natives about

the ability of their societies to integrate the newcomers affect

their support for their society's immigration policies? An underlying

question is whether anti-immigrant reactions are cyclical reflections

of economic or political insecurity, or whether they are structural

reflections of demographic and other trends.

<P>

1. What is the history of Hispanic immigration to Chicago? What

are recent Hispanic immigration trends? What has been the recent

history of their economic and social integration and upward mobility?

<P>

2. How do current residents determine what constitutes the successful

integration of immigrants? What kind of integration indicators

do they look to: economic? language? crime? political activities?

immigrant children? intermarriage? What tend to be the flashpoints

that set off anti-immigrant native reactions? language? religion?

race? ethnic militancy?

<P>

3. How does the geographic concentration and linguistic segregation

of immigrants affect integration? What roles are played by the

nature of political and party systems?

<P>

4. What is the tenor of relations between recent Hispanic immigrants

and other ethnic groups in Chicago? How do Mexican immigrants

relate to Puerto Ricans?<BR>

<P>

<U>Discussion questions</U>: This session focuses on the immigrants,

and discusses how well immigrants are integrating as measured

by various integration indicators. An underlying question is how

the success or failure to accommodate immigrants in turn affects

immigration policy.<BR>


<P>

1. How effective, both during the first half of the century and

more recently, have the public schools been as integrating institutions?

Similarly, what have been the historical and contemporary roles

of institutions such as churches, settlement houses, ethnic associations,

development banks, local political leaderships, etc.?

<P>

2. What is the current tone of relations among the diverse ethnic

groups of Chicago? Cordial and cooperative? Competitive but proper?

Hostile and suspicious?

<P>

3. To what extent do ethnic and racial issues drive local politics

in Chicago? What is the role of citizenship and naturalization

rules in integration? Would adoption of jus soli and easing naturalization

rules promote integration? What are the effects on integration

of recent changes in citizenship laws in France and Germany? Should

an in-between legal status be developed, such as &quot;denizen,&quot;

for settled immigrants who choose not to naturalize?

<P>

4. What effective efforts have been undertaken to minimize discrimination?

To minimize residential segregation of ethnic groups? To manage

conflicts that may arise? What types of organizations have been

most effective in such conflict management? <BR>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc355670174">INTRODUCTION</A>

<P>

The fourth Migration Dialogue was held April 25-28, 1996 in Chicago.

Migration Dialogue seminars provide an opportunity for some 40

opinion leaders from France, Germany, and the US to discuss intensively,

in an off-the-record setting, the major immigration and integration

issues facing the industrial democracies. Each seminar includes

field trips, so that participants can learn about these issues

directly from immigrants and from immigration and integration

authorities.<BR>


<P>

This report was prepared after the seminar, and is being distributed

to participants in the Chicago seminar and to other interested

parties. Since it has not been seen or approved by participants,

it should not be construed as a consensus document discussed and

debated by participants. An agenda and list of participants are

attached.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc355670175">The Questions</A> </H1>


<P>

Four types of questions framed the Chicago discussions. First,

how did diverse immigrants come to be integrated in the US in

the past, and what are the lessons of history for integrating

the current wave of immigrants? In Europe, how can countries be

grouped in terms of their policies to integrate immigrants, and

why does there seem to be a sense that individual country experiences

show that there are &quot;many ways to fail&quot; when it comes

to integrating immigrants?<BR>


<P>

Second, why, by most criteria, do Hispanic immigrants seem to

fare worse than Asian immigrants arriving in the US today, but

better than US-citizen African Americans and Puerto Ricans? Are

there similar country-of-origin and ethnic differences in the

economic integration patterns of newcomers in Europe?<BR>


<P>

Third, what mechanisms brought about the integration of third-wave

European immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century?

Why do the integrating institutions--schools, unions, military,

churches etc.--seem to be less successful in integrating newcomers

today? Should they be revived and reformed, or do new immigrants

and new circumstances call for different integrating institutions

and policies? Given shrinking central government revenues, where

can the funds for efforts to integrate 21st century immigrants

be found? <BR>


<P>

Fourth, about one in eight Americans is African American, including

about 40 percent of Chicago's 2.7 million residents. African-Americans,

especially those in the central cities, have high rates of joblessness

and poverty. Some argue that African-Americans have been the US

residents most negatively affected by immigration, while others

believe that there is little relationship between the socio-economic

problems of African-Americans and recent immigration patterns.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc355670176">Immigration and Integration </A>Policies

</H1>


<P>

<B>Immigration policies</B> refer to questions such as--how many

immigrants should be admitted? From where? In what categories

or through which doors should immigrants enter--what is the proper

balance between immigrants admitted for family, economic, and

humanitarian reasons? In most countries, immigration policies

are exclusively the authority of the central government.<BR>


<P>

<B>Integration or immigrant policies</B> refer to public efforts

to deal with immigrants after their arrival, and they are set

by a mix of federal, state, and local policies. In the US, most

immigrants are &quot;sponsored&quot; by their US relatives or

US employers, and families and employers are expected to accommodate

them without public intervention or assistance. <BR>


<P>

Sponsorship is so powerful an integrating mechanism that the Commission

on Immigration Reform recommended that the US maintain the sponsorship

system rather than switching to a point system for admitting immigrants.

<BR>


<P>

Federal immigrant policies (1) are targeted on certain limited

groups, especially refugees, (2) regulate the access of newcomers

to general services provided by federal and state governments,

and (3) are determined in part by courts interpreting the rights

of immigrants based on their physical presence in the US. The

US has a relatively limited welfare state, and provides few targeted

services for immigrants who are not refugees. Most recent reform

efforts would further restrict the access of immigrants to government

services.<BR>


<P>

European countries offer more government services, and often provide

special services for immigrants, including, in some cases, public

support for maintaining the languages and cultures of newcomers.

However, it appears that, regardless of the policy mix adopted

in Europe, foreigners have unemployment rates about twice native

rates--similar to the 2 to 1 ratio of Black to white unemployment

in the US--and there have been clashes in many European countries

in which natives have attacked foreigners.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670177">Data</A> </H2>


<P>

Several speakers emphasized that immigration to the US is increasing

in number--roughly one million arrivals per year, 70 percent are

legally admitted. The immigrants are bimodal in origin and characteristics.

On the one hand, about 40 percent of US immigrants are from Latin

America, speak primarily Spanish, and have for the most part,

less education than the average US-born adult. On the other hand,

an equal proportion are from Asian countries, speak Chinese and

other Asian languages, and many have more education than US-born

adults.<BR>


<P>

Immigrants in the US are concentrated in certain neighborhoods

of six cities in six states. This concentration magnifies the

effects of immigration in those locations, with the consequence

that scholarly and popular attention is directed there. About

eight percent of the US population is foreign-born, but 95 percent

of all US residents live in places that have less than eight percent

foreign-born residents --Dade County, Florida has the highest

percentage of foreign-born residents--45 percent in 1990.<BR>


<P>

Studies of the economic effects of immigrants on US workers were

optimistic in the 1980s, in the sense that they found few negative

effects of immigrants on the wages or unemployment rates of similar

US workers, including African Americans. Studies in the 1990s

reach the opposite conclusion--immigration has a significant negative

effect on unskilled US workers, depressing their wages, and causing

US workers who compete with immigrants to leave areas with concentrations

of immigrants, or to seek jobs where there is little immigrant

competition, as in the public sector.<BR>


<P>

Until the 1980s, immigrants roughly replicated the US-born population

in the single-best predictor of earnings--years of education.

Immigrants arriving since the 1980s, however, have a different

distribution of years of schooling. When arrayed by years of education,

they are concentrated at the extremes of the distribution, so

that immigration joins globalization and technological change

as a factor that is squeezing people out of the middle class--pushing

them up or down the job ladder--and increasing competition at

the bottom of the labor market.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670178">Integration: Definitions</A> and Experience

</H2>


<P>

When two or more distinct groups share a geographic area, two

extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration

or assimilation</B> means blurring or diminishing boundaries between

groups, encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings

etc. <B>Pluralism or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand,

means encouraging the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating

or welcoming ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to

as the melting pot versus the salad bowl approaches to integrating

immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Since definitions of social issues usually contain at least the

seeds of proposed solutions, the definition of integration is

crucial for understanding the degree of integration of particular

immigrant groups. It was noted that Germany tends to define integration

in terms of lineage--persons descended from ethnic Germans in

the ex-USSR are more &quot;integrated&quot; in the sense that

they are automatically made citizens while Turks are by definition

less &quot;integrated,&quot; since they must acquire qualifications

in order to attain citizenship. <BR>


<P>

France, on the other hand, measures integration chiefly as an

ability to speak French. Foreigners who speak French will have

overcome a major hurdle to be considered French nationals. <BR>


<P>

The criterion of full integration in the US is citizenship, and

the US has the easiest path to citizenship of the major countries

of immigration--birth in the country, or five years of legal residence

and rudimentary knowledge of the English language and American

history and government. <BR>


<P>

One of the major questions in integration policy is whether there

is a trade-off between the number and the characteristics of immigrants

and the ease of integrating them. Thus, do countries tend to take

more immigrants if the immigrants are mostly professionals who

tend to earn high incomes and contribute tax dollars immediately?

Do efforts that make integration more difficult--such as Proposition

187's bar to services for unauthorized immigrants--help to control

the influx of such immigrants?

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670179">US Integration Policy</A> </H2>


<P>

The United States has been shaped by immigration, and American

culture is the result of an amalgamation of many cultures. From

the starts, residents of the US have worried about whether every

group of newcomers to arrive could be successfully integrated

into American society. Benjamin Franklin lamented that the Germans

arriving in Pennsylvania in the 1750s would not become English

and would impose their language on the English. The German settlers

did, however, become Americans, and English remained the dominant

language. <BR>


<P>

Because America has been in constant flux throughout its history,

it was suggested that the kaleidoscope, the metaphor first used

by the historian John Higham to describe the reconfiguration of

American society as it added new elements, was more descriptive

than the more static metaphors of the melting pot or the salad

bowl. <BR>


<P>

Americans tend to think of the immigrants of long ago as good,

and the immigrants of the present day as bad, leading to the aphorism

that one can tell that newcomers are integrated into the US when

they want to stop immigration. Immigrants have long been associated

with good things--new blood and entrepreneurial dynamism, revitalization

of neighborhoods, and scientific breakthroughs--as well as with

disagreeable developments such as crime and disease, unemployment

and welfare usage, and fears of disloyalty and cultural change.

<BR>


<P>

American history suggests that the crucial variables affecting

immigrant integration are the number of immigrants, their characteristics--including

whether they concentrate in particular cities/areas--and socio-economic

&quot;receptivity&quot;--the state of the economy and the degree

of political confidence felt by residents. Government policies

aimed particularly at immigrants have had little to do with it.

In the history of the United States, integration, it was noted,

has been the result of unique constellations of historical circumstance

that cannot be made to repeat themselves. The past does not offer

models that can be adopted for use at a later time. 

<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670180">US Integration Instruments</A> </H3>


<P>

The US has a relatively limited welfare state that allocates benefits

to the &quot;deserving needy,&quot; such as the elderly, coupled

with an extensive set of court-determined individual rights. The

allocation of public benefits to groups which made their case

in Congress, and then using courts to expand access to benefits,

was born in the civil rights era of the 1960s, and came to be

expanded to include immigrants, who are mostly &quot;minorities&quot;

in US parlance. Affirmative action for blacks started as redress

for past wrongs. Benefits for newly arrived people from abroad

are justified as remedies for present-day discrimination. <BR>


<P>

US integration policy has been described as a system in which

individuals are assigned to groups, representatives of each group

negotiate with government for rights and privileges, and the resulting

social change facilitates the integration of diverse groups. 

<BR>


<P>

Many Migration Dialogue participants were of the view that there

is a contradiction between the US policy of admitting increased

numbers of poor and minority immigrants and the simultaneous attempt

to balance the budget by scaling back the welfare state and reducing

the access of immigrants to social services. This libertarian

thrust of US immigration policy would permit numbers to remain

high, and make naturalization the gateway to the reduced level

of benefits available.<BR>


<P>

The contrast with Germany is striking. Legal immigrants in Germany

have relatively full access to the more generous German welfare

state, and Germans discuss whether additional targeted programs

should be available to foreigners. <BR>


<P>

Governments on both sides of the Atlantic, however, are scaling

back public benefits, and deregulating their economies. Increasingly,

therefore, immigrants will have to fend for themselves in restructuring

economies and societies. <BR>


<P>

Early this century, immigrants finding their way in industrializing

America achieved substantial social and economic upward mobility.

Some achieved positions of power in unions and in politics that

they used to combat unemployment and monopoly business power.

Integration or Americanization was promoted by social workers,

settlement houses, and schools. For the largest immigrant group,

Germans, the pace of integration was forced by two world wars,

and the public use of the German language was stopped as a token

of loyalty to America. 

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670181">European Integration Policies</A>

</H2>


<P>

Europeans tend to define immigrant integration differently than

do Americans--they perceive German or French language and culture

as more fixed than Americans view theirs --and to look to different

indicators of integration--unemployment rates, or the rate of

physical attacks on foreigners, for example. Most European countries

occupy the assimilation end of the integration spectrum--France

defines integration to include learning proper French and &quot;acting

French&quot; in public--with well-defined exceptions for historic

minorities. <BR>


<P>

None of the European countries has multicultural immigrant integration

policies designed specifically for &quot;different&quot; immigrants,

as in Australia and Canada.<BR>


<P>

American data tends to compare the progress of groups with reference

to indicators of integration. The groups are defined by race and

ethnicity. Europeans tend to look to compare foreigners and citizens.

<BR>


<P>

In the US, the major gaps are between races, including the 2 to

1 ratio of African Americans to white unemployment rates. In Europe,

there is about a 2 to 1 ratio of foreigner to citizen unemployment

rate, and it does not vary significantly from country to country.

<BR>


<P>

The US has often associated high rates of crime with immigrants.

In California, about 40,000 of the 140,000 persons in prison were

born abroad, including 20,000 who were believed to be illegal

aliens when they committed felonies. In Europe, by contrast, successful

integration was defined in terms of the absence, or infrequency,

of attacks by nationals on foreigners.<BR>


<P>

Germany has a famed school-to-work transition program that provides

two-thirds of the non-college bound high school graduates with

a certificated skill. This apprenticeship certificate normally

leads to a good job that can last a lifetime. However, foreign

youth, including those born in Germany, often do not participate

in the apprenticeship system, consigning themselves to lower wages

and more uncertainty.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670182">Unauthorized Migrants</A> </H2>


<P>

Integration policy normally refers to legal immigrants and refugees.

But many of the migrants in industrial democracies are in a &quot;gray

area&quot; in which they are either tolerated or continue in an

unauthorized status. How does the proportion of migrants who are

legally-invited immigrants and refugees affect integration policies?

<BR>


<P>

Germany and the Scandinavian countries believe that they can prevent

illegal immigration, so they make sharp distinctions between legal

and illegal migrants, with the result that some public employees

other than those directly concerned with immigration are involved

in immigration regulations. France and the US, on the other hand,

are more likely to accept their inability to eliminate illegal

immigration, leading to incomplete amnesties and the development

of schemes through which some rights are granted to illegal aliens

<H1><A NAME="_Toc355670183">Focus on </A>Illinois and Chicago

</H1>


<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670184">Illinois</A> </H2>


<P>

Illinois is the sixth most populous state, with almost 12 million

residents in 1996--75 percent white, and 8 percent foreign born.

Illinois is often described as two states--the Chicago area, with

about six million residents, including 80 percent of the state's

immigrants, and &quot;downstate,&quot; another six million residents

who are 90 percent US-born whites. <BR>


<P>

The state's population has been in the 11 to 12 million range

since 1970, a period during which the US population rose by 60

million, and the population of California increased by 12 million.

<BR>


<P>

Illinois has been losing US-born residents, and receiving about

45,000 legal immigrants each year, plus an estimated 15,000 unauthorized

immigrants. <BR>


<P>

There are about one million foreign-born persons in the state.

Eighty percent are in the Chicago area, making immigrants about

nine percent of Illinois' 12 million residents-- almost 20 percent

of Chicago's 2.7 million residents were born abroad.<BR>


<P>

Of the almost one million foreign-born persons in Illinois enumerated

in the 1990 Census, about 40 percent were from Mexico and Latin

America. One-third of the immigrants in Illinois were from Europe;

the largest single group was from Poland. One-fourth of the foreign-born

were from Asia, with the largest single group from Philippines.

<BR>


<P>

Seven of the top 15 immigrant countries of origin are European,

and 40 percent of Illinois's immigrants arrived since 1980. About

107,000 of Illinois's K-12 students are in some type of bilingual

program.<BR>


<P>

About two-thirds of the &quot;old&quot; European immigrants have

become naturalized US citizens, almost half of the Asian immigrants

are US citizens, and less than one-third of the Hispanic immigrants

are US citizens.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670185">Chicago</A> </H2>


<P>

Chicago, a city of 2.7 million on the southern shores of Lake

Michigan is about 40 percent African American, about 35 percent

white, about 20 percent Hispanic, and five percent Asian. About

one-third of the Hispanics were born abroad.<BR>


<P>

Chicago was for many years the second largest city in the US,

after New York City. Its growth was due to its role as the transportation

hub for the US, and a meat packing and manufacturing center--its

stockyards slaughtered one billion head of cattle and hogs, and

its factories included a Western Electric plant with 48,000 employees.

<BR>


<P>

Immigrants from Germany and Ireland, as well as southern and Eastern

Europe, who found manual jobs in factories and railyards, gave

Chicago a reputation as a city with &quot;broad shoulders&quot;

that &quot;worked&quot;--often under very hard conditions at low

wages. Each of these immigrant groups founded its own neighborhood

church, giving Chicago separate Catholic churches and schools

for e.g., Irish, Italian, German, Bohemian, and Croatian groups.

<BR>


<P>

Like other midwestern cities such as Cleveland and Detroit, Chicago

attracted African Americans--southern Blacks saw Chicago and other

midwestern cities as &quot;the promised land,&quot; and 50,000

migrated to Chicago between 1915 and 1920, and another 100,000

in the 1920s. Hundreds of thousands of small farmers and sharecroppers

migrated into Chicago, especially after 1945. <BR>


<P>

African Americans initially remained in the southern parts of

Chicago, near the terminus of the railroad that brought them to

Chicago. During the 1960s, there were numerous clashes between

Blacks and ethnic white immigrants as Blacks attempted to desegregate

housing by moving into ethnic Polish or Italian neighborhoods--repeating

what has been termed &quot;the chasing across the prairie&quot;

of various racial and ethnic groups.<BR>


<P>

Automobiles and freeways changed Chicago after World War II, as

the better off groups moved to the suburbs. The 1970s and 1980s

were marked by the economic decline of Chicago, white flight to

the suburbs, the entrance of Blacks into local city politics,

and the loss of factory jobs that paid high wages and could be

filled easily by newcomer immigrants. 

<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670186">Little Village</A> </H3>


<P>

The Little Village section of Chicago is one of two areas of heavy

Mexican immigrant settlement. This previously Czech immigrant

settlement is ringed by one-story factories that turn out a variety

of non-durable goods with relatively low-wage immigrant workers.

<BR>


<P>

Many of the settled Mexicans have begun small businesses to serve

the immigrants who continue to arrive--the 26th street shopping

district reportedly was second only to Michigan Avenue in shopping

dollars. However, there was some uncertainty about whether the

second generation schooled in the US would commit themselves to

taking over family businesses that often require very long hours

of work.<BR>


<P>

The factories employing mostly Mexican immigrants tend to recruit

workers by asking their current workers to refer family and friends

to fill vacant jobs. One factory processed the workers referred

by such family networks through a temporary employment agency,

so that all new workers were in effect probationary hires for

several weeks to several months. Once they were selected as permanent

employees, the employer offered them with pay at their regular

hourly rate for the time spent completing a GED high-school education.

<BR>


<P>

Another factory employed over 2,000 workers in a sprawling facility.

A condition of employment was that they work five or six 12-hour

days. At entry level, the first eight hours were compensated at

the minimum wage, with time and a half for the remaining four

hours. The long hours of work seemed to serve as an effective

screening device that favored newly-arrived Mexicans--many Americans

expect a 40-hour work week.<BR>


<P>

The schools in the 22nd ward of Chicago where Little Village is

located tend to be older two story structures jammed with students

born in Mexico. Many of the teachers do not live in the neighborhood.

Chicago has elected school boards, and school board elections,

in which unauthorized residents can run for office and vote, has

helped to launch several political careers.

<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670187">Polish Immigrants</A> </H3>


<P>

There are one million residents of Polish ancestry among the six

million persons in the Chicago metro area--two-thirds of them

live in the suburbs. An estimated 125,000 of them speak primarily

Polish, and 60,000 are believed to have arrived since 1990. <BR>


<P>

There were about 17,600 Polish applications for legalization in

1987-88, including 5,300 Polish SAW applications. Some 8,000 Poles

were legalized in the Chicago area in 1986-87. About 160,000 or

five percent of the three million applications for legalization

in 1987-88 were filed in Illinois.<BR>


<P>

There are several Polish language newspapers and radio stations,

reflecting both rising immigration and the fact that many immigrants

in the 1980s were dissident intellectuals.

<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670188">African Americans</A> </H3>


<P>

About 12 percent or 26 million Americans are African-American,

self-designated, since persons select their racial and ethnic

identity in the US for the census and other government agencies.

Blacks are about half of all US minority residents, and they are

generally those least likely to have achieved the American dream--the

success that is thought to be possible for anyone who works hard,

no matter how humble his/her station at birth. <BR>


<P>

Sentiments of African Americans are divided on immigration. Some

see minority immigrants as potential allies in the struggle to

obtain more benefits for minorities in the US; others see immigrants

as competitors for low-wage jobs that who retard African American

progress. Some whites argue that, if Asians and Caribbean Black

immigrants can fulfill the American dream, this demonstrates lingering

poverty is the fault of the individual, and not the US economic

system.<BR>


<P>

It was explained that comparisons of various immigrant groups

with US born Blacks are often misleading, because the Blacks in

the data include all American Blacks, whereas the immigrants are

often selected, or self-selected, from their home population because

they are likely to succeed in the US. Korean or Caribbean Black

immigrants, for example, are often drawn from the middle and upper

ends of the education and motivation spectrums of their societies,

and can be expected to do better in the US than the average Black.

<BR>


<P>

Similarly, most US-born Blacks were educated in urban areas of

the US and are thus familiar with the history of discrimination

against generations of US African Americans. They are far more

skeptical about the value of hard work for low wages than recent

immigrants from rural Mexico.<BR>


<P>

The indicators of integration for US-born Blacks put them near

the bottom of the US job ladder. But the same is also true for

many immigrant groups are also near the bottom, including Hmong

refugees and Dominican immigrants. If these groups fail to succeed

in the next generation or two, then the notion that the American

dream still works may be called into question by middle-class

Hispanics and Asians.<BR>


<P>

As immigration has increased in the 1980s and 1990s, evidence

has mounted that, as economic theory and common sense would suggest,

immigrants depress the wages and increase Black joblessness. In

1980 in Chicago, for example, there were two Blacks for every

Hispanic employed in construction. By 1990, Hispanics outnumbered

Blacks in the Chicago construction industry.<BR>


<P>

There are tensions between minority immigrants in Chicago. For

example, the public housing system is primarily Black--Hispanics

are about 20 percent of Chicago's population, but they are only

two percent of the tenants in the city's public housing units.

Even Lawndale Gardens, public housing in the heart of Little Village,

has only five percent Hispanic tenants.<BR>


<P>

Despite severe problems in the public housing system, there is

a long waiting list of persons wanting to get into public housing,

and the Chicago Housing Authority stopped taking applications

in 1985--persons moving in to subsidized units in 1996 applied

in 1981. Residents in public housing pay 30 percent of their income

for rent, and the government makes up the difference.<BR>


<P>

Hispanics sued the CHA in 1994, arguing that many Hispanics were

dropped off the waiting list because they did not respond to requests

for updated information that was available only in English.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670189">Chicago--Similarities and Differences</A>

</H2>


<P>

Immigration into Chicago is in some respects similar to immigration

elsewhere. First, immigration is accelerating ethnic shifts, making

minorities taken together sum to a majority, first in the central

city, and later in the region as a whole.<BR>


<P>

Second, the integration of European immigrants in Chicago served

as the basis for the three-generation language-shift integration

theory--the first generation did not learn English, the second

was bilingual, and the third was monolingual English. The University

of Chicago was the base of the leading theorists of immigrant

integration for much of the 20th century.<BR>


<P>

Third, as in other areas, immigration in Chicago brings promises

and problems. One the one hand, immigrants are credited with filling

vacant jobs, starting small businesses, and revitalizing neighborhoods.

On the other hand, the roughly 45,000 immigrants arriving in the

state each year, plus another 15,000 unauthorized immigrants,

are blamed for overburdening especially overcrowded school systems,

contributing to crime, and adding directly and indirectly to welfare

costs. <BR>


<P>

Chicago and Illinois are also different from other places in their

immigration and integration patterns. First, Chicago has a history

of successfully integrating diverse immigrants, and unlike other

cities, Chicago still has a relatively large number of manufacturing

jobs open to unskilled and semi-skilled immigrants. The political

climate in Chicago and Illinois seems to deter extremist reactions

to immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Second, Chicago&iacute;s immigrants are more diverse than is common

elsewhere. The three leading countries of origin for immigrants

in Chicago are Mexico, Poland, and the Philippines, making Chicago

the only major US city in which the three leading countries of

origin are on three different continents. There are also relatively

few refugees in Chicago, so that few newcomers go directly into

the welfare system.<BR>


<P>

Third, Chicago has long been associated with distinct immigrant

neighborhoods, the Irish in one neighborhood, the Polish in another,

and the Germans in a third, Lithuanians in a fourth, etc. Today's

immigrants are also concentrated in particular neighborhoods,

and they can utilize Chicago's peculiar brand of politics to achieve

some degree of political integration. Since the city has over

50 aldermen for just over 2.5 million residents, each local politician

represents just 50,000 residents, and residents turn to their

alder person to participate in social events such as weddings,

and to deal with city hall.<BR>
