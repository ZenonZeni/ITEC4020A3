BINARIANG RISES TO MALAYSIAN TELECOMS CHALLENGE

Binariang scotched talk that it is way behind with plans to become
Malaysia's second carrier with last week's successful launch of the
country's first telecoms satellite.

The on-schedule launch, from the European Space Agency facility in
Kourou, French Guiana, put Malaysia on a par with its neighbours in
terms of satellite TV capability and reaffirmed Binariang's commitment
to challenge the mostly government-owned Telekom Malaysia in every
sector of its business.

Binariang, which paid for the Arianespace launch, holds licences for a
cellular network, a satellite communications system, international
gateway services and a fixed network - the only Malaysian company so
endowed.

The company reckons its advanced 2-satellite system - a second Hughes
Space & Communications Co. spacecraft will be lofted in the middle of
the year - will give it the technological muscle to beat the best
telecoms service providers at home and abroad.

The first of the satellites has 5 high power Ku-band transponders and
12 C-band transponders which will give Binariang the capacity for 40
digital TV channels, 8 digital radio channels, a GSM cellular system
and the digital firepower to fulfil its domestic and international
telecoms aspirations.

Binariang - controlled by Malaysian oil, gaming and property tycoon
Ananda Krishnan - will beam only TV programming approved by the
government. Except for Singapore, Malaysia is now the only Southeast
Asian country that outlaws satellite TV.

Legislation is passing through parliament to change the law so that
Binariang can beam into Malaysian homes - and those beyond. But there
is no legislation that will help Binariang beat the 7 other companies
muscling for a slice of the telecoms market in Malaysia.

Competitors say that because Binariang has been late in getting its
fully digital GSM cellular network up and running, the company has made
it easier for less worthy competitors to resist government attempts to
force mergers in the overcrowded industry. Because of the late GSM
start-up, Binariang is now competing in a 5-way battle for the 600,000
or so Malaysians that own mobile phones (See APTA July 17).

Late last year Binariang was at pains to deny claims from competitors
that it was behind schedule with its roll out of services. Said Donald
Swan, Binariang's chief operations officer: "If you launch 4 lines of
business on an integrated basis in 12 months there are bound to be
problems". Swan is also a vice president of US West, which last year
took a 20 per cent stake in Binariang for an estimated $230m.

A huge potential problem for Binariang is the government's abrupt
policy reversal last June (See APTA June 5). After handing out licences
to all comers, Kuala Lumpur decided there had been too many takers and
that a shake-out should be engineered. Prime Minister Mahathir said:
"If possible, there should be mergers among them so that there are only
3 or 4 companies."

At a heated meeting in September, the licence holders said they had no
intention of doing this. The government had issued the licences and was
legally obliged to honour the commitments it had made.

Binariang, Time Telekom and Mutiara Telecommunications all insist that
they are going ahead with their investments - despite rumblings from
within government about overcapacity and duplication and agreement
within industry that there will undoubtedly be some rationalisation at
a future point. On this, Swan said: "There is going to be a shakeout in
this new industry and Malaysia is going to be no exception. You will
see mergers and partnerships and people becoming niche players."

A long shot is for Time Telekom, part of the politically well connected
Renong group, to buy a controlling share of Telkom Malaysia from the
government.

A fourth likely survivor would be Celcom, the first private cellular
network and by far the biggest with over 75 per cent of cellular
subscribers. For 1996, the big action in the Malaysian telecoms
industry is going to be in mergers and acquisitions.

AUSTRALIA: FOXTEL-AUSTRALIS MERGER FACING RESISTANCE FROM WATCHDOG

The A$700m merger of Foxtel, the cable TV partnership of Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and national carrier Telstra, and Australis Media,
the microwave and satellite broadcaster, is striking unexpectedly stiff
resistance from Australia's competition watchdog.

This is good news for Optus Vision, the cable TV and telephony arm of
Australia's second carrier Optus Communications, which faced a bleak
future if the merger of Australis and Foxtel was approved
unconditionally. The merger would cut the number of players in
Australia's fledgling pay TV industry from 3 to 2 and combine Telstra's
comfortable lead over Optus Vision in cable rollout with Australis'
monopoly over satellite and microwave distribution (See APTA October
23).

Although there is no widespread expectation that the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission would actually block the merger,
comments by its chairman, Professor Allen Fels, have raised the
possibility that the ACCC will impose strict conditions.

This would force a rejig of the merger, under which Telstra and Optus
would sell Foxtel to Australis for stock giving them a combined 60.5
per cent of its total capital. They would also have 6 directors out of
10.

Professor Fels said in early January the ACCC was worried about the
impact of the merger on the pay-TV and telephony markets, and that
telephony was of more concern because of its vast size. However, he
stressed that no decision had been made. The merger was announced in
October and Australis and Foxtel said they expected the deal to be put
to Australis shareholders in early December.

They executed formal contracts just before Christmas and Australis
advised the Australian Stock Exchange it expected to release documents
in mid-January for the meeting. Both companies have maintained a
steadfast silence since Professor Fels went public with his concerns
about the merger. They had hoped for a decision at the first meeting of
ACCC members for the new year 2 weeks ago, but nothing emerged except
reports the commissioners had endorsed Professor Fels' hard-line stance
on the merger.

Optus Vision has argued the merger would create a "communications
colossus" that would have "devastating and irreversible" effects on
competition and consumers and threaten Optus Vision's plan to crack
Telstra's local calls monopoly with cheaper local calls.

Australis and Foxtel have replied that the merger would make little
difference to competition in the pay-TV market because the 2 companies
already run common programming under an earlier deal sanctioned last
year by the ACCC's predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission. The TPC
appeared to treat pay-TV operators as participants in a broader TV
market that included terrestrial free to air broadcasters in its
reasons for that decision.

Although it emphasised this did not constitute a final determination of
the relevant market for pay-TV operators, the decision was taken as a
sign that the merger would be approved on the grounds that a merger of
fledgling pay-TV operators would have little impact in a market
dominated by established terrestrial broadcasters. But Professor Fels
played this down, saying the merger could be found to be anti-
competitive in telephony - the bigger market - even if it had been
found not to unduly affect competition in pay TV.

After a slow start Australis' subscriber numbers have more than doubled
in the space of a few months to about 70,000, largely as a result of
having adopted Foxtel's giveaway A$20 connection fee and A$40 a month
subscription rates.

Neither Foxtel nor Optus Vision, which did not launch their services
until September/October, have revealed subscriber numbers.

AUSTRALIA: TELSTRA FACES TARIFF RETHINK

Telstra suffered a setback in its plan to restructure tariffs aimed at
service providers late last year (See APTA December 18). Australia's
telecoms regulator, Austel, rejected 2 new service provider tariffs in
the course of approving a package of changes to residential, consumer
and business tariffs. The changes slashed business line rentals, long
distance and ISDN charges and sharply rationalised Telstra's
bewildering range of flexiplan discount plans.

They were designed to help Telstra compete better with Optus and the
aggressive service providers which have taken $3bn in annual revenues
from Telstra. They also aimed to force a rationalisation among service
providers, especially at the bottom end of the market where aggregators
simply combine the bills of their customers and pass back the resulting
volume discounts to them, leaving Telstra to bill and service them
individually.

The flexiplan changes resulted in the withdrawal of 2 local call plans
that proved extremely popular with aggregators, offering volume
discounts of up to 15 per cent, and replaced fees with per account
thresholds for those that remained.

Telstra argued that the heavy use of these tariffs by simple
aggregators was requiring it to pay the discounts without enjoying the
savings of dealing with a single high volume customer.

The tariffs were replaced by 2 new service provider tariffs offering
discounts of up to 37 per cent on long distance and 8 per cent on local
calls for service providers operating full billing help desks and some
service responsibility.

Telstra's strategy of encouraging service providers to take more
responsibility for billing and service is consistent with the views of
Austel, which does not regard aggregators as sustainable competitors or
believe they bring the same benefits as value added and switched
service providers. But the watchdog nevertheless disallowed the new
service provider tariffs on the grounds that they bundled competitive
services with uncompetitive services (local calls) and did not meet the
needs of the service providers' industry.

Since the disallowance, Telstra has continued to talk to service
provider representatives and was expected to meet with Austel over its
new proposals for these tariffs as APTA went to press.

Telstra was saying nothing about the changes it proposed to satisfy
Austel, but the chairman of the Service Providers Action Network
(SPAN), Brian Perkins, said Telstra was still insisting on bundling
local calls with long distance.

"I don't think what they are proposing is likely to satisfy us or
Austel," said Perkins, a senior executive at the switched reseller AAP
Telecommunications. He added that SPAN had no response from Austel to
its request that the regulator order Telstra to leave its popular local
call flexiplans in place while the fate of the new service provider
tariffs is resolved.

Telstra's new tariffs are slated to take effect on February 1 but
Austel has expressed concern about the inadequate time this leaves the
worst affected service providers to restructure their businesses.

Aggregators are being offered the option of upgrading their facilities
and becoming value added service providers, selling out to a value
added service provider, or applying to become authorised Telstra
dealers on more favourable terms.

AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT SAYS "NO" TO UNIVERSAL SERVICES PLAN

A suggestion by national carrier Telstra that services covered by its
universal service obligations be handed over to Australia's telecoms
regulator Austel to put out to tender was quickly stomped on by the
federal government over the Christmas-New Year break.

The suggestion was contained in a submission by Telstra to a government
inquiry into community service obligations under its new competition
regime, which is exposing utilities and the professions to competition
regulation for the first time.

Telstra's submission said the current practice of leaving it with sole
responsibility for providing uneconomical services - such as services
to rural and remote areas and payphones - failed the test of economic
efficiency and was inconsistent with government's plan to bring in more
competition after 1997.

The carrier also said the cross-subsidisation inherent in universal
service reduced incentives for investment by Telstra or other carriers
which might otherwise have entered the market for these services.

Telstra was backed by the Australian Telecommunications Users' Group
(Atug), which agreed that tendering would ensure "the best service is
provided at the best price" and said the way some rural services have
been provided under USO arrangements was "nothing short of appalling".

This was a reference to the digital concentrator radio system (DRCS)
that Telstra uses for remote parts of Australia that can not
economically be reached by landlines.

Telstra chose DRCS over the Aussat satellite service (now owned by the
second carrier Optus Communications) but this is widely believed to
have been a mistake. Atug says DRCS proved "grossly inferior" and the
Aussat satellites "would have been a much superior arrangement."

Optus and AAP Communications - a subsidiary of AAP Information Services
and a corporate half brother to the switched reseller AAP
Telecommunications - both expressed support for the idea and said they
would be interested in looking at any services put up for tender.
However, the Federal communications minister Michael Lee said USO
services would not be put out to tender as the idea had been rejected
when the government fashioned its post-1997 reform package last year.

Opposition communications spokesman Senator Richard Alston supported
Lee and said cross-subsidies from city to rural and remote customers
would remain under his party's plan to privatise Telstra.

Their caution can be explained by the proximity of a tight Federal
election, which must be held by May but is being tipped to be held in
March, and by the electorate's sensitivity to telephone service prices.

Telstra's initiative was reported as an attempt to "privatise"
universal service, but these are already calculated by Austel and paid
for by the 3 carriers in proportion to their revenues. This would
continue if they were put out to tender by Austel.

AAP Communications supplies "full mesh networks" to mining camps using
satellites and Hughes telephony earth stations, including payphone
services that offer employees calls to capital cities at local call
rates.

The group's director of marketing Geoffrey Rolls said it would
"certainly" be interested in providing similar services to Telstra's
rural and remote customers. It could run a network via satellites with
a hub in Sydney or Perth, or alternatively "beam bandwidth into a
remote area then split it off into effectively a local loop," he said.

Mark Harwood, Optus' sales manager for national media, said Optus would
look at any USO services put out to tender but "it would have to be a
business case decision."

HONG KONG: HUTCHISON RESTRUCTURES IN ASIAN EXPANSION DRIVE

Hutchison Whampoa is to revamp its telecoms units as part of a new
expansion drive focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. The company
stressed the move is not preparatory to a separate listing for its
telecoms interests; however, the restructuring would simplify such a
move further down the line.

At the same time, Hutchison bought back a 25 per cent stake in its
paging business from Motorola, the US semiconductor and personal
communications giant. Motorola retains a 30 per cent interest in
Hutchison's Hong Kong cellular telephone business.

Analysts are loathe to rule out the prospect of a future spin-off,
especially now that plans to float Orange, the UK personal
communications network, are coming together.

Under the shake-up, a new umbrella company Hutchison Telecommunications
Hong Kong (HTHK) has been created to consolidate the marketing and
operational resources of Hutchison's mobile telephone, paging and fixed
line network services as well as its trunked radio service in China,
Hong Kong and Macao. The move, in classic Canning Fok style - Fok has
been the group's managing director since 1993 - aims to create
synergies resulting in greater productivity and cost effectiveness.

It is the second big shake-up in Hutchison's 10 year telecoms history.
Hutchison Telecommunications was formed in 1986 to spearhead expansion
in Hong Kong's relatively competitive (that is, cartel-free) paging and
cellular mobile phone sector. However by 1992, having expanded into
overseas markets and nibbled at satellite, Hutchison unveiled a major
retrenchment of its telecoms operations, sacking 40 staff and
surrendering its Asia-Pacific ex-Hong Kong, China and Macao operations
in the process.

This time round there are no casualties, just aggressive expansion
plans. The group will this year invest HK$700m to upgrade its network
services in Hong Kong and expand its mobile infrastructure - the number
of cell sites have already swollen threefold to 300 (from 100) over the
past 5 months.

The company claims to have some 120,000 mobile phone customers and says
about 30,000 customers have subscribed to its recently launched fixed-
line network in Hong Kong. Hutchison plans to double both subscriber
bases this year.

Less bullish is the outlook for the lower market CT2 network, the
sector that proved to be Hutchison's Achilles heel in the UK where it
was ultimately forced to close its Rabbit CT2 operation, writing off
HK$1.4bn in the process. Locally subscribers to Hutchison's CT2 network
have dwindled to below 70,000 from 100,000 last year.

Telecoms businesses in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region will come
under the wing of Hutchison Telecom International, headed up by CN
Khoo. Included here, as well as paging and mobile services, are VSAT
and radio broadcasting.

While Hutchison is one of the colony's leaders in mobile services -
commanding some 18 per cent of the mobile telephone market and 29 per
cent of the pager market - its debut in the fixed network arena at the
end of last year was less pronounced. This is at least partially a
reflection of erstwhile monopoly Hongkong Telecom's stranglehold on the
market and partly to do with Hutchison's own strategy which is broadly
similar to that of fellow new entrants New T&T and New World Telephone
(See APTA June 5).

As well as emphasising discount international calls (still strictly the
exclusive province of Hongkong Telecom, although many loopholes to get
round this exist), all 3 companies are relying on newest technology to
provide a total package for consumers, with a different range of niche
services designed to appeal to business and residential users.

The synergies thrown up by Hutchison's revamp will be seen as the fixed-
network builds on its mobile communications strengths, with wireless
services revolving round the hub of its wireline technology.

The company, again like its 3 new competitors, is bidding for the new
mobile licences which were to have been awarded last year but have been
held up by deliberations in Beijing (See APTA June 19, November 6).

INDIA: BASIC SERVICES AUCTION HEADS FOR THIRD ROUND

Following the poor response to the second round of bidding, the auction
of basic services licences in India is heading for its third round.

The second round which earlier this month drew bids for 5 of the 13
licences on offer, only attracted 6 of the 16 consortia eligible to
bid. Ten groups opted to stay out of the round altogether.

Of the 13 licences on offer, only Punjab attracted more than one bid
(See table over page) and all the offers were far beneath the
astronomical fees quoted by the Himachal Futuristic-led consortium
(HFCL-Bezeq) in the first round (See table and APTA September 11,
December 18).

Licences back on the table for a third time will be: Andaman & Nicobar,
Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, North East, Uttar
Pradesh (East) and West Bengal.

Any further progress will in all probability await a decision from the
Supreme Court on the numerous petitions calling for the privatisation
to be re-examined. The court has ruled that basic services licences
will not be issued until all the petitions - of which there are now 10 -
 have been looked into and disposed of.

Following the second round, Tata Tele Service, Basic Tele Service,
Reliance Industries and Techno Telecom India are set to win the 4
licences of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Bihar respectively
as they are the only groups which bid for these circles. Essar Bell
Atlantic should be operating basic services in Punjab where it is ahead
of its only rival, Bharti Telenet, in its offer.

Shyam Telecom and Hughes-Ispat are set to operate services in Rajasthan
and Karnataka as the licensing authority, the Department of
Telecommunications (DOT), accepted that it had been mistaken in
rejecting their bids in the first round (See APTA December 4). Added to
those already allotted, 12 of the total 21 basic services on offer
nationwide have been allocated.

Analysts say there were several reasons behind the poor turn-out in the
second round including the growing controversy over the HFCL-Bezeq
consortia's winning bids and last month's parliamentary uproar over the
handling of the tender (See APTA December 18). But the strongest
negatives were the high reserve prices set by the Department of
Telecommunications for each licence - the fee had not left to much room
for profits - and the extremely tight tender deadline.

A representative of AT&T Birla said the group had decided not to rebid
for Gujarat where it had made an offer which was rejected as being too
low. "After a thorough evaluation of the business case, the J-V
concluded that at present our figures do not come up to the level of
the reserve price determined for Gujarat," he said.

If it were not for the strong business interests of the companies which
made offers in the second round, even the 5 licences where they placed
bids might have had no takers.

The Reliance industrial group has over $8bn worth of power, refinery,
petrochemical and downstream business coming up in Gujarat. The Tata
industrial group and Bell Canada, partners in Tata Tele Service, and
Usha Telecom, the Indian partner in Techno Telecom India, have already
won cellular licences in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively.

Essar is reportedly buying equity in one of the companies selected for
the Punjab cellular licence.

RPG, the local partner in the Basic Tele Service group, is involved in
cellular in Madras - capital of the state of Tamil Nadu where it placed
the only bid for the basic services licence for that state. It showed
its special interest in this licence by offering a fee of roughly 2 and
a half times that over US West-BPL's offer in the first round - an
offer which was $285m over its initial offer for the licence.

Aside from the Tata Tele Service group which offered more than double
the Rs18bn ($520m) it bid in the first round for Andhra Pradesh, fee
offers for the other circles were only marginally above the DOT's fixed
NVP.

Bidders are still baffled at the formula behind the reserve prices set
by the DOT on each licence, and the Department has still not disclosed
how it came up with the figures. The reserve price for the Gujarat for
instance is much less than that for the relatively less prosperous
states of West Bengal and Kerala.

Meanwhile, Bharti Telecom is the first of many aggrieved bidding groups
to turn to the courts. The J-V has submitted a petition to the high
court which says it should have won the licence for Punjab.

Sunil Mittal, Bharti Telecom chairman, said the situation was
"ridiculous". The company had offered a quote over 2 times the figure
deemed as a reasonable levy by the DOT when it bid in the first round,
but still was not allocated a licence.

Tata Tele Service has also now turned to the courts to resolve its
dispute over the DOT's decision to allocate the Maharashtra licence to
the Hughes-Ispat group. Though Hughes-Ispat offered $674m over the Tata
Tele Service bid, the latter was told it had won overall "on points" -
there are a number of additional criteria which are included in the
evaluation process. However, higher authorities then decided to reject
this decision made by the Tender Evaluation Committee and to award the
licence to the highest bidder - the Hughes-Ispat alliance - instead.

Alongside these 2 new cases, India's Telecoms Industry and Services
Association (TISA), which lobbies on behalf of local telecoms
interests, has turned to the court to block the DOT's decision to
charge the first instalment of the licence fee before the operators
begin service.

INDIA: CRACKS APPEAR IN CELLULAR J-VS

Cracks have appeared in 3 of the J-Vs selected to operate cellular
services in India last month over disputes which are certain to end in
partnership changes.

Differences have emerged between partners in the Koshika Telecom,
Modicom Network and HHS Communications J-Vs over recent weeks.

Pilipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel), foreign player in the Koshika
Telecom J-V, has been pitted against majority partner, Usha India Ltd.
(UIL) in a highly-publicised disagreement over its equity stake (See
story page 9) while Modi Wellvest, majority partner in the Modicom
Network alliance, appears to be in a terminal dispute with its US
foreign partner Vanguard. Singapore Telecom is seeking a way to back
out of Hinduja HCL Singtel (HHS Communications).

Problems at Modicom Network, the Indian-US-Thai alliance which holds
licences for the 2 areas of Punjab and Karnataka, appear to hinge on a
dispute over how much equity capital the foreign partner should tip in.

Vanguard says it agreed to invest $13m of the $50m equity required for
the $100m project (to be funded on a 1:1 debt-equity ratio) for a 26
per cent stake. But the Modis claim that project costs have now risen
to $250m and Vanguard must pump in more funds if it wants to keep a
grip on its 26 per cent stake.

Vince Snowden, Vanguard's representative in India, said the company was
not willing to give more than agreed in the original shareholders
agreement and had no intention of giving its permission for a change of
partnership. "Modicom used our networth and experience as keys to
secure the licences and now after getting them, they want to bring in
new players at our expense," he said.

Last month, Modi Wellvest approached the DOT saying it wanted to
replace Vanguard with Telstra - Modis' partner in cellular services in
Calcutta. But Telstra replied in a statement that not only had it "not
made any commitment to anyone or any consortium to buy in or join the
consortium" but that "Telstra is not contemplating participation in the
Modicom consortium."

Modi then said that Motorola and Lazard Brothers Asia were planning to
join it with 20 per cent and 29 per cent equity respectively, but
Chicago-based Bob Young, vice president, Motorola Network Ventures
Division said Motorola had been approached by a number of cellular
operators to invest in their ventures, "but nothing has been finalised
as yet."

This tangle has remained unresolved despite intervention last week by
Telecom Commission chairman R K Takkar. Modi Wellvest holds 51 per cent
of Modicom Network and the 23 per cent balance is held by Thailand's
Telecom International.

Meanwhile, Singapore Telecom is reportedly seeking to withdraw from the
HHS Communications J-V - licensed to operate in Tamil Nadu - as it is
not keen on participating in a single licence zone. To take on the
licence, the J-V is required to up its original offer by $84m to match
the fee offered by the highest bidder in that state (US West-BPL
Cellular which offered $238m). Ashok Leyland and HCL are the other
Indian partners in the venture.

So far, the DOT appears to be taking a lenient view of the possible
partnerships changes emphasising it wants to see services kick-started
as soon as possible.

Takkar says the DOT will not interfere if the changes fall within
Company Law and Foreign Investment Promotion Board guidelines and new
foreign partners are financially qualified and have necessary service
operation expertise. Government has the right to vet ownership changes
in the first 3 years under the contract agreements, but appears not to
wish to get involved.

The DOT has also been forgiving in allowing consortia to take longer in
paying the first instalment of the licence fees required - the tender
conditions are very specific in saying that if the licence fee is not
paid by the date due, the next highest bidder will be given the chance
to step in. Takkar said however: "The offers won't be cancelled unless
we are convinced that the parties are not serious." He noted that
companies are having to pay a heavy penalty in interest payments on the
amounts they owe and would not bear the burden if they weren't serious.

So far, 28 licences of the 33 selected are set to operate services in
their licence areas having deposited the first instalment of the
licence fee and signed the licences (See APTA December 18). The licence
fees are to be paid in 10 annual instalments.

Koshika Telecom, Modicom Network and HHS Communications have still to
make the first payment (due to their internal disputes) as have Aircel
Digilink and Hexacom India for their Rajhasthan licences. These last 2
groups have sought an extension until month-end following a dispute
with the DOT over whether they should match the highest offer for the
circle quoted by the Modicom group. Modicom was only permitted to take
up 2 cellular licences due to the tender's networth restrictions and
opted to drop the Rajasthan licence after it placed winning bids in 3
circles (See APTA December 18).

The second Karnataka licence has gone to J T Mobile. J T Mobile had
made an identical offer to AT&T Birla for the licence and the DOT broke
the tie by a draw of lots.

JAPAN: NEW MINISTER VOICES 'SERIOUS' RESERVATIONS ON NTT BREAK-UP

The break-up of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) which has
been at the centre of debate in the Japanese telecoms sector over the
past few months has taken a new direction under Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's cabinet.

Hashimoto, who became Japan's leader on January 11 appointed Ichiro
Hino to the "sensitive" position of Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications and within a few days of taking office, Hino stated
that he has serious reservations about the idea of breaking up NTT into
a few companies.

Hino noted that the ultimate decision will be a political one that will
take into consideration the views of all 3 ruling coalition parties -
Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party of
Japan (that of ex-prime minister Tomichii Murayama), and the New Party
Sakigake. Hino has also said that many politicians acknowledge that NTT
is striving to restructure its organisation so as to boost its
efficiency - some have argued this negates the necessity for its
breakup.

Serioku Kajiyama, the new chief cabinet secretary (the official
spokesman for the government) added that it is probable that there will
be no quick decision on the proposal to divide up NTT. Such a decision
would be likely to be made in the next fiscal year, according to
Kajiyama. The principal concerns were how Japan can remain competitive
with other advanced nations in the telecoms arena and how a possible
break-up of NTT would affect the country's international
competitiveness, Kajiyama said. He implied that to divide up NTT would
mean scattering the resources of Japan's sole telecoms company capable
of competing in the global arena.

Japanese newspapers have widely reported that Prime Minister, Hashimoto
opposes the idea of an NTT breakup. Furthermore, with elections coming
up in the not-too-distant future, major politicians like Hashimoto seek
to avoid alienating NTT's labour unions - which will mobilise tens of
thousands of votes.

The Telecommunications Council, an independent advisory body, is slated
to submit a report to the government in late February that is likely to
advocate a division of NTT so as to spur domestic competition. However,
the new Hashimoto cabinet appears to be more concerned about Japan's
status vis-a-vis international telecoms competition and especially in
nurturing Japan's technical capabilities in the sector.

Hashimoto's position largely opposes the idea of dividing NTT on the
basis that it would damage NTT's research efforts as well as its
potential to "compete" with international heavyweights such as AT&T,
MCI and British Telecom.

NTT - Japan's "flag carrier" - is currently limited to the domestic
market, but the new government's rationale could indicate that it may
be allowed to compete internationally sooner than might have been
expected.

PHILIPPINES: PILTEL THREATENS TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN J-V

Philipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel) has threatened to withdraw from a J-
V with Usha India Ltd. after disagreements over how the partnership
would be divided.

The Philippines' leading mobile-phone provider and Usha have resumed
negotiations to head off a collapse of Koshika Telecom Ltd., which won
licences to operate cellular telephone service in 3 areas of India.

Both sides have expressed confidence that deal can be worked out that
will allow Piltel a larger stake. In the meantime, a New Delhi court
has issued a restraining order blocking Piltel's withdrawal.

Piltel notified Usha that it intended to drop out of the partnership
after the Indian company refused a request for a larger stake. Under
preliminary agreement, Piltel was granted a 10 per cent equity interest
in Koshika with an option to increase to 34 per cent.

Usha has balked at allowing the increase, saying Piltel failed to
exercise its options before the bidding for the cellular licence was
issued late last year. Usha holds 85 per cent of shares in Koshika with
the balance of 5 per cent in the hands of a US-resident individual,
Chirinjeev Kathuria. "We are still in the process of negotiations,"
said Joseph Santiago, head of Piltel's legal department. "We just want
them to stick to the original agreement."

Santiago sent a team of negotiators to Manila to try to hammer out the
ownership disagreements with out success. Another round of talks was
scheduled in January. The court has instructed Piltel not to withdraw
or dilute its shareholding below 10 per cent until the case is disposed
of. The next court hearing is fixed for March 27.

Analysts said Piltel's threat to quit Koshika was nothing more than a
negotiation ploy to force Usha to increase the Philippine company's
equity stake. Without Piltel, the J-V could be in jeopardy along with
the cellular phone licences.

"Piltel wants to increase their participation to the point where they
are the managing partner," said Wilfred Son Keng Po, vice president at
Worldsec International Ltd. in Manila. "Usha wants a silent partner."

Vineet Rai, senior vice-president of Usha said Piltel had realised the
real worth of the project after the licences had been issued. "We will
not succumb to arm-twisting by our foreign partner," he said, "and by
obtaining an injunction we are further securing our position."

Ajay Chaudhury, Koshika Telecom chief executive added that the first
stage of the project would be completed by April 2 "with or without
Piltel". Piltel refused to send its technical staff for the project
unless it was allowed the additional equity, but Koshika brought in
Telecom Finland subsidiary, Telecon, to assist.

When the partnership with Usha was announced, Piltel officials said it
was a step toward taking the cellular company regional by providing
expertise in designing cellular networks in developing countries.

Piltel is the largest cellular phone operator in the Philippines with a
subscriber base that is forecast to reach 195,000 subscribers by year-
end. The country's population is about 65m.

Koshika's 3 service areas cover 260m people in Orissa, Uttar Pradesh
West and Uttar Pradesh East. That is a potentially lucrative source of
additional revenue, particularly when Piltel faces growing competition
at home.

Santiago said the experience in India hadn't soured Piltel on becoming
a partner in other companies in the region. "We are still trying to
look into being partners in other countries in the region," Santiago
said. "We have to learn from our experience in India."

Ramon Cojuangco, Piltel chairman, said 2 countries near India had
approached the company about cellular contracts.

PHILIPPINES: PLDT MAKES FIRST STAFF CUTS

For the first time in the company's long history, Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Corp. (PLDT) is eliminating jobs to increase
efficiency and trim excessive costs.

PLDT said it will eliminate 661 jobs - or 2.3 per cent of the total
workforce - thorough lay-offs or early retirements. The cuts are the
first phase of a retrenchment programme that could reduce PLDT's
workforce by 10 per cent.

"This is a significant change in the company's culture," said Ricardo
Tan, assistant vice president for investor relations. "We've never done
this in the 7 decades of our existence."

The departing employees include 35 executives, 243 managers and 383
workers. The company did not say how much it will spend for early
retirement or how much the long-term payroll savings will be.

PLDT is among the region's most inefficient telcos with about 48 lines
per employee, compared with 196 for Hongkong Telecom and 97 for Telekom
Malaysia, according to CS First Boston. Total salaries and wages in
1994 were Ps4.03bn ($153.8m), or nearly 29 per cent of the company's
overall expenses.

The lay-offs come as the 67 year old company undergoes an unprecedented
expansion to try to meet growing demand for communications. Between
1993 and 2001, PLDT plans to add almost 3m lines to its current network
of about 1.5m. It also plans to make its network all-digital to offer
new network services such as call-waiting and conference calls.

PLDT officials said many of those leaving are personnel familiar with
old equipment that the company is phasing out. "Some, rather than go
through retraining, would rather retire and take the golden handshake,"
Tan said.

"The programme will immediately cause some huge cash outlay, but the
medium- and long-term cost savings are enough to offset any initial
expense," said Conrad Andres, research director at DVP-Daiwa Securities
Philippines Inc.

PLDT, a former monopoly, now faces at least 8 companies in the
lucrative market for international calls. Some 60 per cent of its
revenue comes from overseas calls. Since December 1, it has had a
policy of not hiring new personnel.

SRI LANKA: SRI LANKA PRESSES AHEAD WITH TELECOMS PRIVATISATION

Sri Lanka has announced plans to press ahead with the privatisation of
the state-owned telephone company, Sri Lanka Telecom, within 6 months
despite widespread protests from trade unions.

Telecoms Minister Mangala Samaraweera said Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) was
unable to meet the explosive demand for phones in the country and
desperately needed fresh capital to expand its services. "Privatisation
of Sri Lanka Telecom is non-negotiable," the minister said adding that
trade unions were resisting because they were not fully aware of the
process.

Earlier this month, the government awarded the restructuring of SLT to
a consortium comprising investment bankers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, accounting firm Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu International and law firm Slaughter and May.

The minister said SLT together with 2 private operators with a licence
to provide wireless loop connections will be able to hook up only
400,000 new telephones by 1997 although the demand would be well over
1m. He said SLT was committed to an investment of some Rs20bn ($377m)
in the next 18 months but would find it difficult to raise the capital
unless it was privatised soon.

"We need huge resources to develop telecommunications," Samaraweera
said. "We must understand the realities of the 21st century. We have to
move forward with the new technology and for that we can't get money on
our own."

Privately, however, analysts say the government is desperate to raise
money through the sale of its assets to meet a huge budget deficit
brought about by its ballooning defence expenditure. The ruling
People's Alliance had opposed privatisation when it was in opposition,
but was forced to resort to do it to bridge the budget deficit of
Rs87.5bn (1.65bn dollars) in 1996.

The government hopes to raise Rs21bn ($396.22m) from the sale of state
enterprises during 1996. The Sri Lanka Telecom sale along with the
national airline AirLanka are expected to raise most of that revenue.
Both will be up for grabs by the middle of the year. Sri Lanka Telecom
had a turnover of Rs5,000m (94.33m dollars) in the year ending
September 1995.

Telecommunication trade unions say that retrenchment will be inevitable
as private management's take over SLT, which currently employs some
7,500 workers. The number of direct exchange lines operated by SLT is
200,000.

The World Bank has been asking Sri Lanka Telecom to reduce its staff
but officials said they were only prepared to reduce the worker/phone
ratio by increasing the number of phones. However, there was no money
for that.

The trade unions argue that tariffs will rise sharply following
privatisation. The SLT currently charges Rs13,000 ($245) for a new
phone connection although the actual cost is estimated at Rs106,000
($2,000).

"Privatisation is a curse," said J. B. P. Dissanayake, the president of
the Joint Organisation of Telecommunication Unions (JOTTU). "We all
must oppose it," he added.

SRI LANKA: GREEN LIGHT FOR FOREIGN WIRELESS LOOP VENTURES

Sri Lanka has given the green light to 2 foreign consortiums to set up
private telephone networks across the country using wireless loop
technology.

Secretary to the ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, K. C.
Logeswaran said the cabinet had accepted proposals by Bell Canada and
Telia of Sweden to set up networks with 100,000 lines each within 3
years. "They will have 3 weeks to incorporate companies locally to
undertake the work," Logeswaran said. "Thereafter, they will be issued
licences to (formally) operate parallel networks in competition with
(state-owned) Sri Lanka Telecom."

The 2 consortiums will have to pay a once-and-for-all fee of Rs300m
($5.66m) each for the licence but they will be free to determine their
tariffs.

"We got the initial proposals on June 30 and within 41 days we were
able to go through the technical evaluation process and obtain cabinet
approval for the 2 private networks," Logeswaran said.

Logeswaran said each of the 2 private operators - who will compete
against each other as well - was expected to provide at least 40,000
phone connections in the first year of operation and go up to 100,000
lines within 3 years.

There are some 220,000 potential telephone subscribers in the queue,
some which have been waiting for nearly 10 years for a phone connection
from Sri Lanka Telecom. However, the government estimates that the
actual demand is about 1m.

The two private operators will provide "wireless loop" phone
connections - eliminating the need for costly land lines - connecting
into Sri Lanka Telecom's backbone network to access international
circuits and other phone users in the country.

Long delays in obtaining fixed line phones in Sri Lanka have boosted
the sales of cellular phone operators in the past 6 years. The number
of mobile subscribers is estimated at 55,000.

TAIWAN: CONTROVERSIAL BILLS SHOULD BE PASSED BY MONTH-END

The long anticipated reading of Taiwan's 3 Telecom bills - which could
allow up to one third foreign ownership in telecoms J-Vs and offer up a
raft of new mobile licences - passed 2 readings in the Legislative Yuan
(LY) earlier this month despite persistent protest by telecoms
employees.

Industry observers said the bills are expected to become law by the end
of the month when the terms and conditions for potential operators will
be announced and a review committee formed to examine potential
bidders. The fact that the controversial bills had passed the first 2
readings showed a government commitment to bulldozing the proposals
through the legislature - despite outcries by the national operator's
employees, they said. Delays which have extended month after month
would soon be over; bills that pass the third and final reading become
law.

At a press conference, Liu Chao-shiuan, Minister of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), last month avowed that privatisation "will
happen" and was "inevitable". Since then, the government has repeatedly
stressed that the privatisation of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) forms the backbone of its Asia Pacific
Regional Operations Centre (APROC) plan - the high-profile scheme which
calls for Taiwan to become a regional hub for multinational
corporations and international telecoms traffic.

Meanwhile, however, several thousand DGT employees have continued to
protest outside the LY during the many review sessions being held by
its Telecommunication Committee since late December. They are
protesting that privatisation and liberalisation will see the new China
Telecommunication Co. - a spin-off of DGT proposed under one of the
bills - become an uncompetitive state-owned operator which will be
forced to rationalise, resulting in huge lay-offs.

Union members also threatened to shut off telephone switching systems
that operate public telephones and to destroy telecoms equipment, but
the DGT has countered that any employee found attempting to do so,
would be dismissed. High ranking MOTC officials have asked union
members to take a hard look at "the problems" facing Taiwan's telecoms
industry."

One of "the problems" they feel is the inability of existing
infrastructure to service the needs of large corporations that rely
heavily on the network - the kind of corporations that the APROC policy
is seeking to attract.

Acer Sertek Inc. - Taiwan's largest computer manufacturing company -
dragged this issue centre stage earlier this month when it threatened
to move its international telecoms centre to Hong Kong or Hawaii. Acer
plans to call in a telecoms company, such as AT&T or MCI, to help set
up an international network for them.

The announcement shook several government agencies, prompting the high
ranking Council for Economic and Development to say the group's plans
to move should be taken "as a warning to the country."

Top officials have been quoted in local papers as saying that unless
the 3 bills are passed by the legislature, the lack of a strong
telecoms infrastructure will be detrimental to the island's ambitions
as a regional operations centre.

The pro-liberalisation lobby would appear unstoppable. Minister Liu
said that he and other ministry officials would mobilise legislators to
pass the bills including amendments that call for the lucrative paging
and cellular sectors to be cracked open (See story below).

Several computer associations have also been collecting signatures to
show their support for the passing of the bills.

TAIWAN: TAIWAN PLANS TO OFFER 8 NEW GSM AND PCS LICENCES

Taiwan looks set to offer a total 8 new cellular licences to would-be
operators following a public meeting held last month which looked into
plans to liberalise the sector.

Following the meeting, chaired by Mao Chi-kuo, Vice Minister of the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) it was decided that at
least 3 regional GSM licences (covering north, central and south
Taiwan) and 3 regional PCS licences as well as 2 island-wide PCS
licences should be offered to new operators. Revised proposals are
awaiting approval by the Legislative Yuan (See story above).

Other parties at last month's meeting included representatives from
APROC Window (the group that advised the MOTC to liberalise), high
ranking officials from the national operator, the Directorate General
of Telecommunications (DGT) and private companies vying for licences.

The number of new licences on the table has come as a surprise to many
observers.

Taipei-based David Hoffman, Technology Practice Director at Coopers and
Lybrand, told APTA that while competition would be healthy for Taiwan,
he believed the introduction of so many licences at one time would make
it difficult for consumers to differentiate between the products and
services on offer and for operators to get a head start. He added that
the nature of the licences may not be "entirely fair" to operators: "It
depends on who wins the licences, whether they are also able to work
together," he said. "Taiwan does not have a strong regulator to oversee
that interconnections are easily made.

If the DGT is involved in the process, it would be in their own
interest to make it as difficult as possible for their competition to
enter the market."

The bills propose an auction method for awarding licences, but this is
coming under fire from local lobby groups. Hoffman agreed: "Auctions
for multiple licenses don't work all that well."

An auction would only encourage collusion and higher pricing because
those who make astronomical bids would be unable to charge more than
the going rates, he said, and recommended a bid-type method of awarding
licenses linked to performance, as was adopted in Hong Kong.

In Hong Kong, operators put down a performance bond, proposed tariff
rates and their plan for network deployment cover range and stated when
they would be up and running. The bidder guarantees to pay a penalty if
it fails to do what it outlined in its proposals. That way, operators
propose their best service, fastest roll out time and are obliged to
come up with their proposed goods on time.

Edmond Tsai, Motorola general manager, told APTA he believed cellular
penetration in Taiwan could reach well over 3m users by 2000 - up to 15
to 20 percent of the 21m population by then.

TROUBLES AT DAYA MITRA - INDONESIAN KSO UNIT - COULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIES

Domestic telecoms provider PT Telkom has launched its remarkable Joint
Operating Scheme (JOS), handing over the running of most of Indonesia's
telecoms infrastructure to private-sector consortia. But with Telkom
Malaysia apparently reconsidering its participation in the scheme,
there is uncertainty about the future of the PT Daya Mitra Malindo
consortium, due to take over the telephone network in Kalimantan this
month.

Telkom president Setyanto Santosa said on 13 January, without giving
details, that there were still difficulties within Daya Mitra.

Daya Mitra has been plagued by unidentified "internal problems" since
shortly after the JOS contracts were signed in October (See APTA
September 25, December 18). The difficulties were earlier thought to
involve a tug-of-war between leading local partner PT Alatief Nusakarya
Corp. and the major foreign partner in the venture, Telkom Malaysia,
regarding control of the project.

In early January Telekom Malaysia, which has a 25 per cent stake in the
consortium, raised the possibility of a withdrawal from the project.
Given that each of the JOS consortia was required to make up-front
payments of tens of millions of dollars any firm replacing the
Malaysian company would presumably "buy it out".

Kalimantan is now the only JOS division that has yet to be handed over
to its selected consortium. Encompassing most of the large island of
Borneo, the territory is the smallest project in the scheme in terms of
both the number of existing lines and the lines to be installed (See
table over page).

Daya Mitra's other members are PT Intidaya Sistelindomitra; Koptuindo
Telecom Malaysia Bhd; TM Communications (UK) Ltd; and American
International Assurance Co. Ltd. Under its contract with Telkom, the
consortium is to lay 237,000 new lines over the next 3 years (See table
previous page).

According to M Furqon I Hanief, executive director of the Indonesian
Telecommunications Society (Mastel), the problems in Daya Mitra is not
one between Telekom Malaysia and Alatief Corp. but is rather,
"something inside Telekom Malaysia".

"If it was a dispute between the partners, Alatief could easily find
another foreign partner," Hanief told APTA. "There are plenty of
Japanese companies which would very much like to participate," he
added.

Alternatively, Hantief speculated, Telkom Malaysia's extended posturing
might be designed to exact changes to Daya Mitra's JOS contract. But he
said he did not know what the desired changes to Daya Mitra's contract
might be. "I have been asking various people about this, but so far I
haven't got any answers," he conceded.

While Daya Mitra is alone among the 5 JOS consortia in holding up its
ascension to the driving seat, Jakarta observers are taking a
sympathetic view of the group's difficulties, obscure as they are.

"It is probably genuine that they are balking at the terms," said
Jakarta-based Robert Adair of GK Goh's Securities. Representatives of
Daya Mitra declined to comment on the problem.

Indonesia's Telkom, which floated 19 per cent of its enlarged share
capital on the New York, London, Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges
in November, has reportedly advised the Jakarta Stock Exchange that
Telkom Malaysia may have to be replaced with another foreign partner.

During their 15-year concession periods, the 5 JOS consortia are
expected to operate and maintain their existing fixed lines in their
respective geographical divisions, as well as laying a total of more
than 2m new lines before the end of March 1999. This expansion is to be
the private sector's contribution to the 5m lines which the government
aims to see laid by the end of its 6th 5-year development plan (April
1994-March 1999).

Telkom is to receive a minimum annual payment from each of the
consortia - in the region of $100m and 30 per cent of their operating
revenues. The existing networks are assumed by the JOS contracts to be
self-financing, while the costs of the new lines are to be borne by the
consortia. As Telkom's Santoso was quoted recently: "Telkom has nothing
to lose."

Greater Jakarta and East Java, Indonesia's 2 largest manufacturing and
commercial centres, will remain in Telkom's hands.

The JOS contracts are said to provide that Telkom may grant further
network-expansion projects to the companies, while the JOS consortia
are to have what is described as "First negotiating rights". Jakarta
based Laksono Widodo of Barings in Jakarta speculated that the Daya
Mitra difficulties involve the number of new lines stipulated in the
contract.

"Probably Telkom Malaysia plans to install more than the number of
lines stated in the contract," he told APTA. "So the local partner
would have to contribute more in terms of investment." Widodo added
that the dispute appears to be between the parties to the consortium -
an increase in the number of lines would presumably entail an amendment
to the contract between Daya Mitra and Indonesia's Telkom.

Any amendment to any of the JOS contracts is bound to be resisted
strenuously by Telkom, not least because of the precedent it would set
for the other 4 consortia. Telkom Malaysia may not be the only
participation company nervous about the profitability of the JOS
scheme, under which the private sector bears virtually all the risks.

"It's quite dangerous ground for Telkom. Others might start asking to
have their contracts amended," said an analyst with an international
firm in Jakarta. "The government wants to avoid any substantial
renegotiation of the KSO (JOS) agreements particularly in view of
future privatisations," the source told APTA.

In the JOS division of Eastern Indonesia, which is comprised of
Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and East and West Nusa Tengara, PT Bukaka
Singtel took over the telecoms network on 3 January. Comprised of
Singapore Telecom International and Fadel Muhammad's Bukaka Telekomindo
International, the consortium is to lay 403,000 new lines.

Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, a consortium of PT Astratel Nusantara (59 per
cent); PT Intertel Pratama Media; the cooperative of telecoms ministry
employees; France Cable et Radio (a France Telecom subsidiary), took
over the existing 600,000 lines in Sumatra on 8 January. Astratel is a
subsidiary of Indonesia's publicly-listed Astra International Pramindo
is expected to install 460,000 new lines on the island at an estimated
cost of $570m. Santosa was quoted as saying that his company's minimum
revenue payment from Pramindo would be Rp514bn for this year, a figure
to be paid on top of 30 per cent of operating profits.

Reuters reported in mid-January that Pramindo has mandated Banque
Nationale de Paris, Chase Manhattan Bank Asia, Fuji Bank and Societe
General to arrange a $350m commercial loan facility to finance the
Sumatra project. The credit facility, which is to be offered for
general syndication shortly, will mature in 8 years.

In the JOS division of West Java, the PT Aria West International
consortium took charge of domestic telecoms on 12 January. Aria West is
made up of PT Aritmas Kencana Murni, PT Aria Bahtera Internusa, US West
International and the Asian Infrastructure Fund. Its contract provided
for the installation of 500,000 new lines, more than doubling the size
of the phone network to 985,896 lines by the end of March, 1999. This
will see Sumatra's telephone penetration reach 3.8 as compared with 1.8
at present. Penetration (the ratio of lines per 100 population) stands
at 1.6 lines nationally.

PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia, made up of PT Indosat, Widya
Duta Informindo, Kokarindo, PT Krida Salindo Sentosa, Telstra
(Australia), Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, Itochu, and Sumitomo
took over the JOS division of Central Java and Yogyakarta on 9 January.
The consortium must lay 400,000 new lines. Mitra Global's minimum
annual payment to Telkom will be Rp300m ($130.4m). According to
Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board, the Mitra Global project
represents an investment of $640m.

TELECOM NEW ZEALAND PLANS TO ENTER CABLE TV MARKET

Telecom New Zealand's planned investment in Sky TV New Zealand may be
under threat, but this will not affect its plans to enter the cable TV
market.

Telecom said late last month that the Sky acquisition has been
"parked". It was reacting to a court order obtained by Clear
Communications which prevents it going ahead with a programming centre
agreement with Sky.

Clear is seeking to have the programming content agreement stopped on
the grounds it is anti-competitive (See APTA October 9).

This court offer follows an earlier one relating to Telecom's purchase
of 24.9 per cent of Sky from its major shareholders Bell Atlantic and
Ameritech. This is in limbo until the courts rule definitively on the
bid by Clear and BellSouth New Zealand to have overturned the go-ahead
for the deal from the New Zealand Commerce Commission.

Telecom has already hinted it might eventually not go ahead with that
part of the deal if the value of the investment, and therefore the
price it has to pay, goes up too much in the intervening period.

As the agreement to acquire a financial stake in Sky was also
conditional to reaching a content agreement, the deal is now in
jeopardy on 2 fronts.

On the other, Telecom says, "Clear's spoiling tactics just reinforce
our determination to get on with the business of providing a new
service and offering more choice to more and more people."

GSM NETWORK IN SHANGHAI

China Unicom, fledgeling second network operator, has attracted 10,000
subscribers to its GSM network in Shanghai since it began signing them
up 3 months ago. Its competitor, the dominant Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT), has a total 160,000 subscribers on 2 analogue
and one digital network in the city.

Unicom, which also has mobile services in Beijing, Tianjin and
Guangzhou, plans to extend its GSM networks to 20 more cities by March.
It also aims to launch its preliminary fixed telephone network in
Shanghai in the first quarter of this year.

Peng Pingxuan, general manager of Unicom's Beijing branch, said he was
confident of the company's prospects over the coming year and believed
Unicom's entry to the market meant good news for the sector.

"Since Unicom was established", he said, "the price of mobile phones in
the Beijing market has fallen by 10,000 Yuan." The MPT was trying to
match its services in the digital phone market, he said, and was
spending heavily on advertising to promote its services for the first
time.

Unicom plans to lay a fibre-optic cable network in Beijing and to add
an additional 40 to 50 base stations to its cellular network there.
This would take its capacity to 100,000 connections in Beijing, Peng
said, including 30,000 lines for long distance calls.

TELEKOM MALAYSIA SIGNING EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS

Telekom Malaysia has followed the example of rival Binariang and
started signing exclusive agreements to provide telecoms services.

Binariang, which last week lofted Malaysia's first telecoms satellite
(See cover story), was the first in the field signing with tenants and
co-investors in the massive Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) project in
the heart of capital. KLCC, the brainchild of Ananda Krishnan (the
controlling shareholder in Binariang), has twin office towers as its
centrepiece that when finished next year will be the world's tallest.

Mohammed Said, Telekom chief executive, said: "We have 20 deals on the
cards, mostly in peninsular Malaysia as well as one in Sarawak".

Typical of the 4 deals is the one signed in January with the property
developer Kemayan Corp., that envisaged an investment of M$1m (US$4.4m)
for designing and installing a fibre-optic based telecoms system in
Rasah Kemanyan, a new township an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur.

Telekom, as normal, receives its payment in revenue deduction but
benefits because Rasah Kemayan residents will have their lines pre-
installed, thus freezing out the competition. Kemayan gains because
Telekom undertakes installation of the systems and maintains them under
a service contract.

Rickie Tang, chief executive of the listed Kemayan said: "The network
installed in the township will include such advanced facilities as
voice mail, mobile telephones, video conferencing and distance
learning".

PAKISTAN'S NATIONAL OPERATOR OPEN TO BIDDING

Pakistan's national operator will be open to bidding from strategic
investors at the end of the month, when the names of interested parties
will also be revealed.

PTC is now officially an autonomous public limited company following
the passing of a government ordinance late last year.

From January 1, the old PTC was segmented with core operations becoming
the new Pakistan Telecom Co. Ltd. (PTCL) and its previous regulatory
functions stripped out into 2 new bodies: the Frequency Allocation
Board (FAB) responsible for frequency planning and allocation, and the
Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) becoming the new regulator and
administrative body.

The National Telecom Corp. (NTC) also bourne from the old PTC will look
after government and military telephones.

The entire privatisation process is expected to be completed by March
when PTCL will see a change in management. The present chairman of PTC,
Mian Javed, will however, be the chief executive of PTCL.

The terms and conditions of the employees will remain the same and any
further changes will be made in consultation with the regulator (PTA).

BUKAKA SINGTEL SHORTLISTS 3 SUPPLIERS

Bukaka Singtel has already shortlisted 3 suppliers for its J-V with
Telkom which calls for a minimum of 403,000 new telephone lines to be
installed under a 15-year concession.

The J-V is anticipated to commence work on the installation process in
April and expects to begin telephone services by the end of 1999.

Bukaka Singtel, 40-per-cent-owned by Singapore Telecom International
and 60-per-cent by PT Bukaka Telekomindo International, is one of 5
groups licensed to install and operate lines all over Indonesia under
revenue-sharing arrangements with the national operator, PT Telkom (See
story page 12).

It expects the project to incur a maximum US$400m capital expenditure
including the installation of lines in its concession area which covers
the main islands of Bali, Lombok, Timor, Maluku, Irian Jaya and
Sulawesi.

Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) got Korea's first digital cellular service
off the ground early this month with the launch of its long-awaited
CDMA network in Seoul.

Service is currently available in Incheon and Pucheon - 2 areas in the
west of the capital - and will gradually become available across other
areas as base stations are rolled out.

Analysts are not expecting explosive digital cellular growth until the
price of handsets comes down. The CDMA handsets offered by KMT are
retailing at a little under $1000. Shinsegi Corp., KMT's sole
competitor, has put off its launch until June.

KMT's CDMA network is the second of its kind to be launched worldwide.
Hutchison Telecom launched the world's first in Hong Kong last
September.

NTT APPLIES TO REDUCE CHARGES ON PERSONAL HANDYPHONE SYSTEM

NTT Central Personal Communications Inc. and its 8 regional group
companies have applied to reduce charges on their personal handyphone
system (PHS) starting February 1.

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) group PHS companies want
to cut their basic weekday short-distance rates to be more competitive
with the PHS firms in the DDI Inc. group (led by DDI Tokyo Pocket
Telephone Inc.) and the Astel group (led by Astel Tokyo Corp.).

The NTT PHS companies also want to reduce their new subscription charge
from 4,200 yen to 3,000 yen.

There were a total 620,000 PHS subscribers in Japan at the end of 1995.
Uptake of the service, which was launched in mid-1995, is developing
much slower than originally forecasts. The DDI group had just over
250,000 PHS subscribers at the end of 1995, and its projection for this
calendar year had been cut.

SRI LANKA TELECOMS PROJECT

Sri Lanka has awarded a $7m contract to a French and Japanese
partnership to provide consultancy services for a Japanese-funded
telecoms project in the mountainous central region of the country.

State-run Sri Lanka Telecom last week signed the agreement with Japan's
Nippon Telecommunications Corp. (NTT) and Sofrecom of France to provide
designs and supervise the work of the proposed project estimated to
cost $94m.

The entire project to establish 37,900 new direct exchange lines and
32,000 trunk is financed through a soft loan from Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and is expected to be completed within
3 and a half years.

Bids for the project are to be called shortly, officials said.

JAPANESE CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS

Japanese cellular subscribers more than doubled in 1995, reaching
8.05m, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun. Subscriptions in calendar
1995 reached 4.68.

Market leader NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc, (NTT DoCoMo) - a
subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. - had a total of
3.93m customers at the end of the year, but its market share fell to
48.8 per cent from 54.4 per cent at the end of 1994. This was the first
time that NTT DoCoMo's share has fallen below 50 per cent.

Second-ranking DDI Corp., had 1.62m customers, followed by 3 other
cellular phone operators.

Subscriptions are continuing to rise at a brisk pace, with December
setting a record of 572,700 new digital and analogue cellular
customers.

The 1995 introduction of the micro-cellular personal handyphone system
(PHS) business, featuring less expensive calls, had not hurt the
standard cellular business, which is expected to grow by at least 1m
new customers every 2 months in 1996, the paper said.

NTT WANTS TO REDUCE LONG-DISTANCE CALL CHARGES

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) wants to reduce its long-distance
call charges from next month but is awaiting a green light from the
regulator, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

If the Ministry gives the go-ahead, other common carriers like DDI
Corp., Teleway Japan Corp., and Japan Telecom Co., are expected to
follow suit.

NTT charges Y180 for a 3 minute daytime call made during a weekday for
distances over 160km. It hopes to cut the rate to between Y140 to Y150
for the base 3 minute long-distance call. A formal decision on the
exact level of the cut are expected by the end of the month (January).

NTT's 3 main competitors charge Y170 for their base 3 minute long-
distance calls and are expected to reduce their rates to approximately
Y10 yen under the new NTT long-distance rates. The pricing must be
slightly lower than that of NTT for them to remain competitive.

NTT last reduced its base 3 minute long-distance charge by Y20 in
October 1993, from a previous rate of Y200 for a 3 minute call.
