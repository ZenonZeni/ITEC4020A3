<font size="+1"><b>Aromatherapy Oils as Oral Remedies</b></font><p>

<i>Essential plant oils can bring relief for urinary tract infections, high blood pressure, trauma, dental infections, bleeding gums, and, with the help of a medicinal earth, appendicitis, hemorrhoids, Candidiasis, and breast cancer.</i><p>

<blockquote><b><i>Can aromatherapy oils, known as essential plant oils, ever be taken orally instead of being used only on the skin or for inhalation as aromas?</i></b></blockquote>

Yes, but to understand how this works, it's important to know that essential plant oils work as potent antioxidants. The shelf life of a good aromatherapy oil can be at least 30 years, which means it doesn't spoil or lose its essence—it is preserved against the negative effects of oxygen, or oxidation.<p>
Protecting against these effects is the job of antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, and E, yet too often vitamin pills begin to smell rotten after a few months. In this state, their antioxidant effect is lost. There is nothing alive there to keep oxygen from doing its damage; in effect, they're dead nutrients.<p> 	
This line of thinking has led me to experiment with using aromatherapy oils orally, as vitamins, remedies, and medications. There is an essence of life in these plant oils that keeps the oxidation at bay—a quality that acts as an antioxidant. You might think of the oil as the blood of the plant: without it, the plant is dead. This is why in my practice the antioxidant activity determines whether a substance is alive or not.<p> 
Unfortunately, many aromatherapy oils are not pure but carry contaminants that can act as mild poisons or produce unpleasant side effects if taken orally. Some oils may be pure, but they are not of the highest quality. For example, if they are prepared from dry rather than fresh herbs that still contain the vital oils intact, they are most likely to be incomplete.<p> 
Through my research,  I've found that you will have no problems taking essential plant oils orally if they are pure. But like any other powerful organic substance, such as enzymes or blue-green algae, you must introduce essential plants into your system slowly with proper monitoring. In addition to taking selected aromatherapy oils orally myself, I have administered them in this way to over 200 patients and have had no evidence of toxicity resulting from oral use.<p>

<b>URINARY TRACT INFECTION</b>. Barbara, aged 43, came to me with excruciating pain, fevers, and chills as part of a urinary tract infection. Her condition had been growing worse for a week. She wanted antibiotics and called another physician who gave her a prescription. I always try to keep patients from using antibiotics whenever possible. I offered Barbara an alternative: a mixture of equal amounts of the essential plant oils of lavender, tea tree, and myrrh. Separately, I blended the oils of onion and garlic of which she would take a single drop on the tongue 2-3 times daily.<p> 
With the lavender, tea tree, and myrrh, Barbara dribbled 6 drops into her bathwater then soaked in the solution for 20 minutes. By the time her husband returned from the pharmacy with the prescription antibiotics, Barbara was symptom free. Over the next few days, she continued the once-daily aromatherapy baths, and she daubed a few drops on her palms and inhaled the aroma about 4 times daily. To this day, Barbara has not had a recurrence of the urinary tract infection.<p>

<b>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</b>. When I first saw him, Martin had dangerously high blood pressure, topping 182/130. I took his blood pressure then asked him to gently inhale the aroma of ylang-ylang essential oil after rubbing it on his palms. After breathing its vapor for only 5 minutes, Martin's blood pressure dropped to 135/80. I tell people to apply the oil directly to their palms, not on a cloth, because whatever is not inhaled as aroma is absorbed directly through the skin.<p>
I must reemphasize that not every version of ylang-ylang oil will produce this remarkable effect in 5 minutes. You need to use oils that are pure and of the highest quality to achieve these effects. People with low blood pressure, however, should not use ylang-ylang oil in this way because it could further drop their blood pressure. I have used this oil with many people with normal to high blood pressure and have had no problems.<p>

<b>TRAUMA</b>. Billy, age 25, had a motorcycle accident, leaving him with skin abrasions and wounds. Fortunately, I had equipped him beforehand with a first-aid kit of essential oils to take on his trip. Immediately after his accident, Billy applied lavender oil directly onto the bleeding abrasions to disinfect, stop the bleeding, and accelerate healing.<p>
He told me afterwards that the wound stopped burning when he applied the oils; instead, as much as this is possible, the wound "felt great," he said. About 2 days after his accident, I examined his wounds and found them all closed. Also at the time of his accident, his ankle appeared fractured; it was swollen and he couldn't walk on it; in addition, Billy had neck pain. Again, he applied lavender oil liberally to these sites every day; within 2 days, the pain was gone. At the same time, he was constantly inhaling ylang-ylang oil for shock recovery and relaxation.<p>
Over the days following his accident, Billy took orange essential oil orally as a general tonic and as a high source of vitamin C. Incidentally, orange oil delivers proportionally a much higher amount of usable vitamin C than most vitamin C pills. Billy took 2 drops of orange oil orally every 4-6 hours for 10 days during his recovery, which was complete.<p>

<b>DENTAL INFECTION</b>. I had a patient named Thomas, aged 70, with an infection at the site of a root canal. This problem had been developing steadily over the previous 5 days.<p>
His left check was swollen and he had fever and chills. I instructed Thomas to take 1 drop each of lavender and orange essential oils and swish them around in his mouth, favoring the area of the infection. He also applied the same amount to his swollen left cheek, gently massaging it into the skin. During the first day, Thomas did both steps twice, after which the infection, pain, swelling, fever, and chills were gone.<p>

<b>BLEEDING GUMS</b>. Frederick had bleeding gums, probably due to a chronic vitamin C deficiency as his diet completely lacked fruits. Instead of starting him on vitamin C, I gave him orange essential oil to take orally. Frederick took 1 drop, 4 times daily; after doing this for a week, all bleeding in his gums stopped.<p> 
Since I knew he was unlikely to radically change his diet or take the proper amount of nutritional supplements I might recommend, I suggested to Frederick that he continue taking the orange oil instead. To make it a little more interesting for him, I mixed equal parts of orange, lime, grapefruit, and Mandarin orange essential oils, of which he now takes 1 drop 4 times daily in lieu of a vitamin C pill.<p> 
I use essential oils instead of vitamins whenever possible. For example, I myself take about 10 drops daily of orange oil; occasionally, I add myrrh 2-3 times a week, as I like the flavor. I also take peppermint oil with meals as a preventive against intestinal parasites.<p> 

<a name="s06"></a>
<b>HOUSEHOLD USES</b>. I continuously inhale the aromas of essential oils, both directly from my palms and from the air in my indoor environment, such as my medical office. As often as 5 times a day, I will daub a few drops of an oil on my palms, rub it into the skin, cup my palms around my nose, and gently inhale.<p>
Before and after patients occupy my office, I mist the air with a blend of various aromas such as lavender, tea tree, eucalyptus, or myrrh (dispersed in water), all of which have strong actions against ambient bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Equal parts of ylang-ylang, orange, or patchouli oils also impart a cleansing atmosphere to my rooms. When patients arrive and inhale the aromas, they are likely to relax, facilitating their recovery.<p>
Let's not overlook the traditional foot bath or full-body soak. Take a large Pyrex glass tray, fill it with warm water, dribble in a few drops of lavender oil, and immerse your feet for 20 minutes. Similarly, you can fill a bath then disperse 5 drops of a single oil or a blend, and soak yourself until you feel relaxed.<p> 
There are so many toxic chemicals in our lives, especially in the home environment, that whenever possible, I try to substitute essential oils to keep the living environment as chemically clean as I can. For example, I use pine essential oil to clean my house, mixing it in hot water as a disinfectant.<p>

<blockquote><b><i>Can essential oils be used to help more serious medical conditions?
Yes, especially when they are used in complement with another substance I have developed, variously called volcanic clay, VMV product, or hemorr-cream.</i></b></blockquote>

<a name="s07"></a>
<b>APPENDICITIS</b>. Robert, aged 36, complained of pain in his lower right intestine which he had endured for a week by the time I saw him. He had fever and chills, there was blood and pus in his stools, and he was becoming constipated. I advised him he needed to go to the hospital emergency room at once for a presumed appendicitis, but he declined. Instead, he said, "Give me something now. I'll go tomorrow, I promise, if I don't feel better."<p> 
I gave Robert a small amount of volcanic clay—a form of "medicinal earth"—which he applied as a compress to his lower abdomen. In one day, the fever was gone, and after a few more days, all his other symptoms disappeared, too. It was most interesting that his next bowel movement after he applied the clay to his abdomen bore highly visible traces of the clay; it had penetrated through his skin into the intestines.<p> 
I had never seen this before in my medical practice, yet it was obvious that when the body needs something, it will do anything to get it to the areas where it is needed most. Robert did well and 3 months later, no sign of his symptoms had returned.<p>
The volcanic clay I'm speaking of is a natural and organic food supplement made of clay from volcanic lake areas and mixed with 18 herbal root extracts from Amazonian rainforest plants. I developed this preparation to supply essential and trace minerals as well as several vitamins in a completely natural and organic form.<p> 
The approach is based on the concept that using the same organic elements that make up the cells of the human body will renew those cells by restructuring the whole organism. I always say I do not "cure" anyone. But if we give the body what it needs, all the essential building blocks, there is no disease that can withstand this.<p> 
For oral use, I mix 1/2 teaspoon of the volcanic clay with a small amount of water in a vial, shaking it thoroughly. It is best to use a plastic or wood (but not metal) teaspoon as the high mineral content of the clay can corrode metal. Then the patient mixes the solution with her saliva, and swallows. Alternatively, the clay may be mixed with 1 tablespoon of unsweetened organic yogurt.<p> 
Conditions such as bad breath, gum inflammation, and dental infections have resolved with the use of this product mixed with saliva, swished in the mouth, and then swallowed. To ensure full absorption, no food is eaten for 30 minutes after taking the clay. You will probably find that your bowels move more often and, if the odor was strong previously, these smells begin to disappear.<p> 
Approximately 85% of people taking the clay daily in this fashion will experience an energy surge within 3-5 days, due to the enhanced nutrition delivered to the body by the clay. If this causes insomnia, decrease the amount or frequency of clay taken. The product may be taken up to 3 times daily—more in certain situations where the energy level is extremely low—or as little as 2-3 times weekly.<p>

<a name="s08"></a>
<b>HEMORRHOIDS</b>. Here is how I use the volcanic clay to treat hemorrhoids. A preparation of the clay mixed with a little water and deposited inside a cannula (a medical tube for insertion into body cavities such as the anus) can be effective. Patients with hemorrhoids can administer one cannula at bedtime followed by another after a week.<p> 
The success rate of this protocol in my experience is 95%. The patients whose hemorrhoids were not completely eradicated had other factors causing them, such as a polyp or cancer of the intestine. I have observed no side effects from this procedure for patients who have hemorrhoids only. Less than 5% of patients I have treated with this intrarectal preparation felt pain around the rectal and prostate areas immediately after administration. These patients had preexisting prostate problems; however, their rectal pain went away after 2-3 more applications.<p>

<a name="s09"></a>
<b>CANDIDIASIS</b>. Taking the volcanic clay orally can help eliminate symptoms of gas, belching, and diarrhea typical of a Candida albicans yeast infection, and usually within a few days. As the process of clearing out intestinal Candida, parasites, and other pathogens and unwanted life forms proceeds, the incidence of diarrhea begins to diminish and transient constipation may result.<p> 
This is actually a good sign, indicating a rapid removal of unwanted intestinal flora. Taking the clay orally, but only once daily before going to bed, will usually resolve the constipation. Another way of regaining normal bowel movements is to temporarily stop using the clay, then slowly restart it at a lower dose. Always pay close attention to how your body feels.<p>
For complete removal of Candida symptoms, every night before going to bed, apply the clay to toe and fingernails and other skin areas suspected of being infected with the fungus.<p>
Martha, aged 37, was obese and suffered from gastrointestinal and toenail Candidiasis fungal infection.  This was probably due to an overuse of antibiotics. She used the clay for 2 months, during which she lost 15 pounds and all signs of fungal infection, gas, bloating, and intestinal distress disappeared. Incidentally, applying the clay to the fingernails enables them to grow at about 3 times the normal rate by increasing their nutritional supply. The increased nutrition is what helps to clear the fungus from the nail.<p>

<a name="s10"></a>
<b>BREAST CANCER</b>. Ellen, aged 76, had a breast cancer 8 inches across that was eroding the chest wall and spreading to her lymph nodes and lungs. Ellen had endured this condition for over 2 years and refused all conventional treatments.<p> 
	Under my supervision, she started applying a mixture of lavender and orange essential oils to her breast and taking 1 drop of orange oil orally with meals, increasing it in a few days to 2 drops, then after a week, to 3 drops.<p> 
After a month, I added 1 drop of lavender oil to the orange, to be taken orally. Ellen also took a small amount of the volcanic clay orally twice daily. In addition, I instructed her to take aloe vera (1 tablet daily), green tea (2 cups daily), Essiac herbs (3 ounces, 3 times daily), and 1 drop of peppermint essential oil added to the orange and lavender taken with each meal to reduce the parasites in her system.<p>
After about 2 months on this program, Ellen's tumor had shrunk by 50%. When she discontinued the clay for 2 weeks, the tumor started to grow again; she resumed the clay and the tumor continued regressing, as before. Ellen tells me she is feeling "fantastic." After having lost 20 pounds—cancer patients almost always lose too much weight—she is now gaining back her weight and her skin color is improving.<p>
Increasingly, I concentrate on finding the freshest, purest, and simplest way to deal with disease, to have my patients take fewer but more powerful supplements. Eventually, I would like them to have to take only one substance. The closest I've come to this is the combination of aromatherapy oils and volcanic clay. The oils deliver nutrients that dissolve in fat while the clay with minerals delivers nutrients that dissolve in water. This is how the body's nutrition is divided, between fat-soluble and water-soluble nutrients. If you can deliver both through the diet, you are providing the body with everything it needs to be healthy.<p>
