        <td>Aside from the fact that it&#146;s always a good idea
        to be proactive in your safety and health
        measures&#133;yes, OSHA can cite you under the General
        Duty Clause &#150; Section 5(a)(1) of the OSHA Act.
        Specifically, &quot;5(a) Each employer-(1) shall furnish
        to each of the employees employment and a place of
        employment which are free from recognized hazards that
        are causing or are likely to cause death or serious
        physical harm to his employees.&quot; Other citations are
        possible under existing OSHA standards such as:
        respiratory protection, record keeping, monitoring and
        medical records access.<p>Since the outbreak of
        multidrug-resistant TB in several facilities,
        transmission of TB to healthcare workers has been in the
        spotlight again. Patients most likely to spread the
        disease are those who have unrecognized TB, are not
        effective anti-TB therapy, or those who have not been
        placed in TB isolation.</p>
        <p>OSHA has identified healthcare facilities and
        long-term care facilities for the elderly to be among the
        places with heightened TB rates. The guideline document,
        OSHA instruction CPL 2.106, Feb. 9, 1996, addresses
        enforcement methods and scheduling for occupational
        exposure to TB. You should expect to meet close scrutiny
        of your prevention and detection practices. According to
        OSHA, violations of these standards will be classified as
        serious.</p>
        <p>Compliance officers must inspect for workplace TB
        exposure in the following cases: in response to employee
        complaints; when notified of TB-related facilities; or as
        part of any industrial hygienic inspection conducted in
        workplaces where the CDC gas identified workers as having
        a greater incidence of TB infection than the general
        population. This means you.</p>
        <p>CDC has developed a protocol for minimizing
        transmission to healthcare workers. It includes
        engineering and administrative controls. Examples of
        engineering controls include: ventilation and air
        cleaning methods, controlling airflow direction, diluting
        and removing contaminated air by ventilation, and air
        cleaning with HEPA filters or ultraviolet light.
        Administrative controls include: rapid identification and
        treatment of TB cases, screening for healthcare workers,
        including administering, tuberculin skin tests, and use
        of isolation rooms for patients suspected of having TB.</p>
        <p>Contact your SIS loss control consultant, for a copy
        of the OSHA Instruction CPL 2.106 or the CDC&#146;s
        latest recommendations.</p>
