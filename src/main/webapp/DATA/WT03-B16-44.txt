IGARSS'97 will be held at the Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre, Singapore, 3-8 August 1997. This new convention facility is situated by the Marina Bay in downtown Singapore, right next to shopping centres, luxury hotels and historical sites. The hosts, IEEE Singapore Section and the Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing, will organize technical visits, including a tour of the newly established remote sensing ground station at the National University of Singapore, and local and post conference excursions for participants and accompanying persons to explore the region.<P>


The theme of IGARSS'97, Remote Sensing - A Scientific Vision for Sustainable Development, highlights the important role remote sensing technology can play in the judicious exploitation of the earth's resources. East and Southeast Asia are among the world's most rapidly developing regions. Singapore, a "garden city" at the heart of the region, is a theme-appropriate site for IGARSS'97. Besides providing a forum for presenting the latest technological developments, IGARSS'97 will also serve to heighten the awareness and promote the application of this important technology in the region.<P>

<B>ABSTRACT SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</B><P>

The technical sessions will be coordinated to provide a comprehensive, well-balanced program of contributed and solicited papers, covering topics of general and specific interest. Oral contributions will be presented in parallel sessions, while interactive presentations may be viewed and discussed in a special session to be held the first conference afternoon. Authors are encouraged to submit abstracts on all subjects of interest to the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society and URSI. The general topics listed below are intended as a guide. <BLINK><B>Abstracts must be received by 13 January 1997</B></BLINK>. All those arriving after the deadline, including invited papers, will only be considered for program placement if space permits. On-time arrival does not guarantee placement, but it does guarantee review and program consideration. <P>

</UL>

<A NAME="address"></A><H3>GRSS will accept abstracts via the following means:</H3>

<OL><LI>Post to IEEE/GRSS € 2610 Lakeway Drive € Seabrook TX 77586 USA
<LI>Facsimile: +1.713.291.9224
<LI>Email to <A HREF = "mailto:tstein@phoenix.net">tstein@phoenix.net</A> -- must be submitted in plain ASCII text, no  attachments. Do not send postscript files!
</OL>
An acknowledgment will be posted to each corresponding author regarding submissions received. Author receipt of acknowledgment depends upon date abstract received and post time; allow more time for abstracts submitted just prior to or on the deadline date.<P>


Abstracts will be used by the Technical Program Committee for selection of papers and composition of the final program; hence, each abstract should clearly and concisely state the problem addressed, the methodology used and the central conclusions. A maximum of three papers may be authored (first author) and submitted by each individual.<P>
