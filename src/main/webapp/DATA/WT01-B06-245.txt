<P>
Remote sensing of the sea ice in the Baltic for support of the
ice breakers have been an ongoing project over some years but
is now finished. The usefulness of SAR imaging has been shown
to be good but a major limitation presently is the coverage. Sea
ice is a very dynamic feature and the area need to be covered
with a 1 - 3 day interval.
<P>
An ongoing project is remote sensing of sea ice in the Arctic
for development of remote sensing methods to determine climate
change influence on the ice as well as navigational aspects. Recently
finished or ongoing projects are: Shipbased scatterometer investigations
of sea ice, Ice ridge modelling, SAR and SSM/I intercomparison,
Ice motion over the Yermak Plateau.
<P>
Some of the activities are illustrated in figure:

illustrating field acitivities on the ice surface for measurements
of ice roughness (main picture). The upper figures illustrate
the ship based scatterometer antenna, an ice image acquired with
video, from helicopter, and a sub-image of a SAR image acquired
by ERS-1 (&copy; ESA, ERS-1,1991).
<P>
An Arctic expedition took place in 1991 to the high Arctic with
the Swedish ice breaker Oden and the German research vessel Polarstern.
The same ships participated in an <A HREF="AO-96.htm">expedition in 1996</A>.
<P>
In 1991 the very first ERS-1 SAR images at high latitudes in connection
with a field experiment were acquired for the program onboard
Oden for Remote Sensing and Sea ice (Jan Askne, PI) and in 1996
similarly some of the first RADARSAT images at high latitude in
conjunction with field experiments. <BR>
