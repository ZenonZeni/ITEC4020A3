<h3 align="center">HEMP AS WEED CONTROL </h3>

<h4 align="center">D. P. West, Ph.D. </h4>

<h3>Weed control is a recalcitrant issue in crops grown for <br>
organic certification. One approach is the prior use of a <br>
competitive crop. In his textbook, Modern Weed Control, A. S. <br>
Crafts cites as potential weed smothering crops: millet, Sudan <br>
grass, sweet clover, sunflower, rape, barley, rye, reed canary <br>
grass, crested wheatgrass, sorghums, buckwheat, soybeans, <br>
alfalfa, cowpeas, clovers, hemp, Jerusalem artichoke, and <br>
ensilage corn. Of these only one, hemp, can be taken seriously as
<br>
an adequate weed controlling mechanism. <br>
The historical testimonials to hemp's ability to control <br>
weeds are numerous. For example:</h3>

<blockquote>
    <h3><br>
    &quot;...it is certain that hemp contributes more than any
    other crop <br>
    towards repairing the damage done by its own growth through
    the <br>
    return of the leaves to the soil, besides other matters while
    it is <br>
    undergoing the process of retting. Hemp is an admirable weed <br>
    killer and in flax countries is sometimes employed as a crop
    in <br>
    rotation, to precede flax because it puts the soil in so good
    <br>
    condition.&quot;<br>
    -Charles Dodge, Director, Office of Fiber Investigation,
    1890.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There will be little trouble with weeds if the first
    crop is <br>
    well destroyed by the spring plowing, for hemp generally
    occupies <br>
    all the ground giving weeds but little chance to
    intrude....In proof of <br>
    this, a North River farmer a few years ago made the statement
    that <br>
    thistles heretofore had mastered him in a certain field, but
    after <br>
    sowing it with hemp not a thistle survived, and while ridding
    his <br>
    land of this pest the hemp yielded him nearly $60 per acre
    where <br>
    previously nothing valuable could be produced.&quot;<br>
    -C. Dodge, Hemp Culture, USDA Yearbook of Agriculture, 1895<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp prevents the growth of weeds and other vegetation <br>
    which would be found on such soils in most other crops or
    after <br>
    others are laid by, and its cultivation also seems to make
    the soil <br>
    more uniform in character.&quot;<br>
    -Lyster Dewey, The Hemp Industry in the United States, USDA <br>
    Yearbook of Agriculture, 1901<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Very few of the common weeds troublesome on the farm <br>
    can survive the dense shade of a good crop of hemp...In one
    4-<br>
    acre field in Vernon County, Wis., where Canada thistles were
    very <br>
    thick, fully 95 per cent of the thistles were
    killed....&quot; Lyster Dewey, <br>
    Hemp. USDA Yearbook of Agriculture, 1913.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp has been demonstrated to be the best smother crop <br>
    for assisting in the eradication of quack grass and Canada <br>
    thistles....At Waupon in 1911 the hemp was grown on land
    badly <br>
    infested with quack grass, and in spite of an unfavorable
    season a <br>
    yield of 2,100 pounds of fiber to the acre was obtained and
    the quack <br>
    grass was practically destroyed.&quot; -Andrew Wright,
    Wisconsin's <br>
    Hemp Industry, 1918.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp has been recommended as a weed control crop. Its
    dense, <br>
    tall growth helps to kill out many common weeds. The <br>
    noxious bindweed, a member of the morning glory family is
    checked <br>
    to some extent by hemp.&quot;-B. B. Robinson, Hemp, USDA
    Agric Bull <br>
    #1453, 1943<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Among the species studied, the hemp species proved
    itself to be the <br>
    best in fiber production. This plant was all the more
    interesting <br>
    owing to its low fertilization requirements, and its ability
    to grow <br>
    without being irrigated and without chemicals, whether it be
    for <br>
    weed or pest control.&quot; Barriere, et al. 19941<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp grows quickly, soon covers the ground and chokes
    out <br>
    the weeds. So weed control is not necessary.&quot; -Eddy A.
    A. de <br>
    Maeyer. 19941 </h3>
</blockquote>

<h3><br>
<br>
In Holland, Lotz, et al. tested hemp's superior weed <br>
suppressing ability <a href="FigWeedLotz.gif89">(Figure 1)</a>
against four other cropping <br>
situations in a controlled experimental setting. The target weed <br>
was yellow nutgrass (Cyperus esculentus), a weed also common <br>
in the US, which propagates by tubers and is difficult to
control. <br>
The authors conclude, &quot;...hemp was the most competitive crop
in <br>
this study. Selecting this crop in a rotation will cause the <br>
strongest population reduction of C. esculentus on infested <br>
farmland. This control option of hemp against harmful weeds as <br>
C. esculentus is an attendant benefit of the introduction of hemp
<br>
as a commercial crop.&quot;2<br>
