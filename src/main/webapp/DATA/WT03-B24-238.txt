<h1><center> 1995 was a very fine year <br>
Performance pays off </h1> </center><p>
<b><center> By Karen Bernstein<br>
Editor-in-Chief</b></center>
It was a good year. Actually, it was a great year. Biotech companies in 1995 did just about everything biotech companies are supposed to do: they reported outstanding clinical data, they got products approved and they proved increasingly attractive to pharmaceutical companies, which stepped up to the plate for both alliances and acquisitions.<p>
If 1994 seemed like the year of the failure -- although it wasn't nearly as bad as the popular perception would have it (see BioCentury Jan. 3, 1995) -- the last half of 1995 conversely may have left the impression that biotech could do no wrong. <p>
If this wasn't entirely true, Wall Street chose to ignore the fine points. Witness The BioCentury 100: It closed the year at 1298.85, up 80 percent, easily beating the S&P 500, which rose 34 percent in 1995. Of the 267 stocks tracked by BioCentury in the year, 206 gained in value. Among those priced at $2.50 or more, prices more than doubled for 86.<p>
The bottom line, as measured by The Carson Group's Life Sciences Indexes, was that the 11 large-cap biotechs gained $14.4 billion in market cap, to $33.3 billion, a 76 percent gain. The 190 smaller cap companies in the Carson index did even better, jumping 100 percent to $21.8 billion. The $10.9 billion gain more than erased the $7 billion drubbing of 1994.<p>
Two key triggers in the second half were Cephalon Inc.'s announcement in June of positive Phase III data for Myotrophin IGF-1 in ALS, and, late in the year, Centocor Inc.'s announcement that two trials of its ReoPro platelet inhibitor in angioplasty were stopped early because of positive results. The former opened up the equity market, while the latter caused a mini-explosion of stock prices at the end of the year. <p>
In addition, the market's reaction to AMGN's announcement in July of preclinical data for its leptin obesity protein -- adding $735 million to its market cap -- showed renewed willingness of investors to reward companies for the potential of biotech products.<p>
In between, the stream of positive clinical and regulatory events seemed endless. Among the most significant of these in the second half, in addition to CEPH and CNTO, were positive Phase III data for Genzyme Corp.'s Seprafilm in abdominal and gynecological surgeries; Genentech Inc.'s Phase III trial of Activase tPA in stroke; Phase III data for DepoTech Corp.'s DepoCyt in neoplastic meningitis; Phase III results for acellular pertussis vaccines from Chiron Corp., Connaught and SmithKline Beecham; Phase III results for Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Gliadel implant for malignant glioma; Cygnus Inc.'s results for its GlucoWatch transdermal device to monitor glucose; Phase III data on Neoprobe Corp.'s RIGScan CR49 to detect colorectal cancer; and Phase III results for Vivus Inc.'s MUSE alprostadil for erectile dysfunction.<p>
<b><center>The approvals list</b></center><p>
FDA panel recommendations, agency approvals or approvable letters came for Biogen Inc.'s Avonex beta interferon for multiple sclerosis; Chiron's Vitrasert ganciclovir implant for CMV retinitis; BioChem Pharma Inc.'s 3TC for AIDS; Sequus Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Doxil liposomal doxorubicin for Kaposi's sarcoma; The Liposome Co. Inc.'s Abelcet liposomal amphotericin B for aspergillosis infection; Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Redux dexfenfluramine in obesity; MedImmune Inc.'s RespiGam for respiratory syncytial virus; NeoRx Corp.'s Verluma for staging small cell lung cancer; and QLT Phototherapeutics Inc.'s Photofrin for esophageal cancer.<p>
There were only a few disappointments: Amgen Inc.'s Infergen consensus interferon in a Phase III trial in chronic hepatitis C and G-CSF in community-acquired pneumonia; a Phase II/III trial of Protein Design Labs Inc.'s Zenapax antibody to prevent graft-versus-host disease; a Phase III trial of Telor Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Xarano ethacrynate sodium in cataracts; CytRx Corp.'s RheothRx in a Phase II/III study in heart attack; a Phase III study of Immunex Corp.'s Pixykine IL-3/GM-CSF fusion protein in bone marrow transplant; and negative FDA advisory panels on Oncor Inc.'s Inform Her-2/neu breast cancer test and Immunomedics Inc.'s CEA-Scan imaging agent for colorectal cancer.<p>
M&A activity, while never as extensive as pundits predict, showed that in critical areas, such as gene therapy, acquisitions provided another avenue to get a return on investment. Notable acquisitions in the second half of the year included Sandoz's acquisition of Genetic Therapy Inc. for $295 million, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's acquisition of the remainder of Applied Immune Sciences Inc. for $84.4 million and Schering-Plough's purchase of Canji Inc. for $54.5 million.<p>
The potential size of some corporate partnerships also signaled the pharmaceutical industry's belief in the future of the technology. Among the deals with potential of more than $50 million in the latter half of 1995 were Corange's $100 million deal with GeneMedicine Inc. to develop gene therapies for cancer; Bayer's $71 million deal with Myriad Genetics Inc. to discover genes for obesity, osteoporosis and asthma; Pasteur Merieux's $50 million deal with North American Vaccine Inc. to develop a meningitis vaccine; Hoechst Marion Roussel's $150 million deal with Cell Genesys Inc. for a gene therapy product for AIDS; Eli Lilly's $50 million deal with Millennium Inc. in atherosclerosis and the genomics company's $60 million deal with Astra to develop products for inflammatory respiratory disorders; American Home Products' $100 million deal with Apollon Inc. for DNA-based vaccines; Solvay's $50 million combinatorial chemistry deal with ArQule Inc.; and Pfizer's $60 million deal with Neurogen Corp. for obesity and eating disorders.<p>
The hard work paid off with an opening of the equity market. For the year, companies raised a total of $3.5 billion in equity, compared to $2.3 billion in 1994. The 1995 take included $1.5 billion in follow-on offerings ($1 billion over 1994), $599 million in initial public offerings, $1 billion in other financings and $377 million in venture capital (see page A15 for a list of fourth quarter funding activity).<p>
<p>
<b><center>Who's buying</b></center><p>
It's not so much that the buyers have changed, as that they're buying more stock. "It's the same old crowd of core buyers," said PaineWebber banker Stelios Papadopoulos, plus momentum and emerging growth players. These investors are buying both on offerings and in the open market.<p>
Among the handful of new players are some growth funds, plus some contrarian funds who were buying the sector in the first half of 1995 and stuck with it. "They basically got the 'bug,'" said Eric Roberts, a banker at Dillon, Read. In addition, he's seen overseas investors who have followed the lead of the European pharmaceutical companies into the biotech group. Those companies saw their chance to enter into biotech collaborations in 1994 and 1995 when there was less competition from the public equity markets, he said.<p>
Roberts believes the growth funds are leading the open market buying. "Some of those emptied biotech out of their portfolios in 1994 and kept it out until September 1995 or even later, and now feel they've missed the boat," he said.<p>
Momentum players also have played a role. They were buyers in the fall, although they dropped off in November, according to Peter Ginsberg, an analyst at Vector Securities International. Now, their interest is piqued again, he said. "They're not back in like they were in August, September and October, but their interest level is coming back because stocks have moved well recently."<p>
Market watchers are agreed that the growth fund buying is spurred by a continued rotation out of technology stocks. "Aggressive tech money has been looking for a home," said Stanley Weinstein, publisher of The Professional Tape Reader in Hollywood, Fla. "I put out a sell on that group in September, and a lot of those stocks have dropped 50 percent in the last three months."<p>
Despite all the hooplah over tech stocks such as NetScape, the biotech sector actually out-performed tech stocks in 1995, according to Hambrecht & Quist banker Dennis Purcell. According to his figures, tech was up 50 percent on the year, while biotech rose 50-60 percent. "If you ignored biotech this year, it was detrimental to your performance as a fund manager," he said.<p>
The Carson Group, which monitors buying behavior for public companies, analyzed the top 15 investors on nine follow-on offerings, and found that much of the money was put in by a group of high turnover funds that are "sector timers." For example, Janus invested $20.3 million, Strong Capital invested $10.5 million and Peregrine put in $9.7 million into the nine offerings.<p>
According to Carson Group figures, Nicholas Applegate invested a net of $49 million in the sector between the second and third quarters, with an average of $3.3 million per position. Peregrine invested a net of $39 million in the third quarter, with an average of $8.6 million per position. Janus invested a net of $35 million, with an average of $7.3 million per position. <p>
Some of these funds and other, similar funds that invested lesser amounts already have sold the shares.<p>
Carson Group analyst Wayne Rothbaum also has heard that money is coming into the U.S. from investors in Taiwan, who've got the jitters from China's saber rattling. "These people want to keep their money in an area they're familiar with, like high tech, but the tech stocks have already peaked," he said. "So the next best group in the technology sector is biotech." <p>
<p>
<b><center>How long the rally can last</b></center><p>
There's a consensus that this rally can last one or two more quarters, if not more, and that as a group the sector isn't overvalued, even if some individual companies are getting a little toppy. "The kinds of stocks that are in fashion do tend to get ahead of themselves," said Michael Dovey, a banker at Montgomery Securities. "For example, you get one protease inhibitor approved and everybody else goes up. For stocks like that, investors are seeing the glass as half full: they're looking at how big it can get rather than at the risks that are there. But the industry overall isn't overvalued."<p>
Papadopoulos also doesn't see any alarming over-valuations. "We really have not hit extraordinary price highs, and most stocks are not at ridiculous prices," he said. "Take Isis: it went public at $10 in 1991. A couple of hundred million dollars later, it's a less risky company and the stock is $13. Athena went public at $12 four years ago, and it's barely at that price today. You may say that was a really crazy time against which we're gauging these comparisons, but this isn't an all-time high."<p>
As might be expected, the successes are leading to a revamping of valuation models. Rothbaum has thrown out his old model, which put late-stage companies with Phase III data or NDAs at $180-$250 million market caps and early-stage companies at $70-$150 million. "Everything has shifted up by $50-$100 million," he said. Later-stage companies are now getting valued at $250-$400 million, or even higher, with some market caps close to $1 billion.<p>
<b><center>Convergence</b></center><p>
Several positive factors have converged to support the continued health of biotech stocks. The spate of clinical successes has restored investor faith, while the critical mass of about 150 products in late-stage development virtually insures that there will be a continued flow of news. Even more important, there's a growing list of biotech products on the market and hence the opportunity for an expanding group of companies to report positive earnings. <p>
The continued political pressure on the FDA to move drugs to market has paid off in a friendlier atmosphere at the agency. "There's been a sea change at the FDA," said Vector's Ginsberg. "The questions the FDA is posing to advisory panels are now biased toward a 'yes' answer. In the past, they were biased toward a 'no' answer or requests for more data."<p>
It's now clear, said Oppenheimer & Co. banker Peter Crowley, that the FDA is going to approve as many drugs as it can, and let the market sort out what will get sold. "They're going back to what they're supposed to do, and managed care will analyze the pharmacoeconomics," he said.<p>
But industry-specific factors alone aren't necessarily sufficient to create a rally. "I never thought that the news in itself is such a major contributor," said Papadopoulos. "In a given environment, the Centocor news could have been a blah, or $2 on the stock. It's the receptivity of the market and the alternative investment opportunities."<p>
Investors have a lot of money to play with coming into 1996, money they made in both high tech and biotech in 1995. This cash is one factor that is going to keep driving valuations upward, said Purcell. <p>
In November, $13 billion flowed into all stock funds, he said, and while very little has been explicitly earmarked for health care, many growth funds have looked to sectors other than high tech to put that money to work. <p>
<b><center>First quarter prospects</b></center><p>
All of this makes biotech stocks a good place for growth-oriented investors to park their money. According to Ginsberg, there has been a positive inflow into health care sector funds in every week since August.<p>
"This is only the tip of the iceberg," said Rothbaum. But it's here that the thin floats of many biotech companies come into play. "People are calling me trying to find shares and they can't get any," he said. "They're looking for companies with good science that haven't yet run up, but they can't find shares, and that's what's driving prices up. <p>
"The people who have held the sector for a long time aren't going to sell now. They've sat through 80 or 100 percent drops and they won't sell now with a 50 percent rise. With an average 10-15 million share float, someone who wants to buy 400,000 shares can't get them."<p>
Rothbaum sees the big explosion coming this quarter, as fair weather investors come into the sector. "It will be back to 1991," he said. "They will propel valuations. So even though I can say a $900 million market cap is ridiculous, these unsophisticated investors don't know that, they don't understand valuations, and they don't care what they pay."<p>
Once that happens, Rothbaum predicted that the seasoned investors will start to take profits. "The rally is sustainable until the smart money decides that valuations have reached the point at which they're content to sell," he said. "There has to be asset allocation at some point: investors have to take profits and move money to new companies. Then the fair weather investors will panic."<p>
But Rothbaum doesn't think that will result in the same kind of bear market the sector has been subject to in the past, because there's now a critical mass of companies with earnings and late-stage products that will provide a core of real news for the group. "That critical mass will smooth the volatility -- it will never be as bad as it was again," he said. "It's just like the big caps never truly collapsed a couple of years ago, because they have earnings and growth."<p>
Dovey also doesn't foresee another crash-and-burn scenario. "I think we're past the stage where people say the industry is a fraud. Now people are taking a more rational approach. Analysts will have to evaluate companies on revenues and earnings, and once that paradigm shifts there's no turning back."<p>
The optimism of investment bankers is echoed in technical analysis. Weinstein put a "buy" on the biotech group two months ago. "The charts look great in your sector," he said. "It will be a real hot place for the next six months."<p>
In the short-term, Weinstein thinks the sector is somewhat over-extended and is likely to correct in the coming weeks. But he is advising his clients to buy on corrections, and he expects money from the high tech sector to continue flowing into biotech. <p>
<b><center>The offerings market</b></center><p>
The big hope, of course, is that bankers eager for fees and companies desperate for money don't kill the goose by flooding the market with too much stock. Some banks have turned away banking business -- though in some cases this also had to do with the significant turnover among analysts last year, leaving several banks with periods when they lacked analysts to support offerings. <p>
The sector is as robust as it's ever been, said Papadopoulos. "It's financially in good condition, and for the first time in a very long time deals have performed well. Better than three-quarters of the deals are trading above their offer prices, and that is what sustains a deals market, not the fundamentals."<p>
Crowley estimates that follow-ons are up 22 percent from where they were priced, while IPOs are up 23 percent, a nice change from the usual scenario. Of the 37 follow-ons he's tracked, 30 are up, while 10 of 13 IPOs are up.<p>
<b><center>Who can, who can't</b></center><p>
The theory remains that banks should be selective about which companies they take to the Street. "The key word for '96 will still be 'selective,'" said Dovey. Companies that will be candidates for follow-on offerings will be similar to those that got the market going last August: those with reasonably high market caps and good news, he said. <p>
Alex. Brown banker Russell Ray seconded that sentiment. "From my perspective, the market window concept is probably passe for the time being," he said. "What you have is a willingness to invest on a selective basis, and the gold standard continues to be product-specific clinical news and sales events. Beyond that, investors will buy broad technology which has been validated by corporate partners. Away from that it becomes much, much more difficult to get anybody to pay attention."<p>
"Investors want to take implementation risk, not clinical risk," according to Dovey. "Companies in the middle of the clinical process, in Phase I/II or Phase II, who will have no data for quite awhile, still have problems. Even though the share prices of some of these companies have gone up, there's a difference between stocks rallying from $5 to $8 on volume of 10,000 shares and investors being willing to buy 2 million shares of that stock."<p>
Nearly all the companies that met the criteria -- late-stage products or limited cash requirements before profitability -- raised money from August to October, said Roberts, and bankers discouraged companies that didn't fit this profile from filing. "As a result, we didn't see the old model where the good companies financed first, and were followed by bad companies which raised money at inflated valuations and then traded down to their true valuations in the aftermarket."<p>
The same selectivity will hold for IPOs, Dovey said. As a result, he expects to see more M&A activity among private companies, as venture capitalists realize they can't take every company public. "Among the VCs I've talked to, I don't think their view of the public market is that great," he said. "So they've got to be thinking about other avenues of liquidity."<p>
A key test this quarter will be whether bankers hold the line and continue to turn away business. This could be tough. "Companies are all lining up for the first quarter," said Roberts. But as the year wears on, the overall equity market (not just biotech) will be about 15 months old, and Roberts thinks more general concerns about equities will arise. "We'll also see concern about biotech, and we may repeat the pattern of the past if we're not careful."<p>
The trick for investors, Purcell said, will be to ferret out those companies still valued at $100 million that are in late-stage clinical trials, and guess which of those will become $500 million companies in the near term.<p>
He also sees a stronger class of IPOs in 1996. Many private companies have organized themselves on the assumption that they could never go public, he said. Ironically, as a result, they have much sounder business plans than they might have otherwise.<p>
<b><center>Reality check</b></center><p>
Ultimately, all of the products now reporting positive clinical data will be tested in the marketplace. Some, like Merck's Fosamax for osteoporosis, and BioChem Pharma's 3TC for AIDS, probably will be adopted rapidly. Others, like CNTO's ReoPro for angioplasty, will ramp up more slowly.<p>
At some point -- possibly starting in late 1996, but certainly by 1997 -- there will be enough sales history on new products for investors to begin to correlate how valuations based on clinical trial results end up tracking with actual sales. If the managed care reality turns out to be a bit less rosy than the predictions of companies and Wall Street analysts, expectations will ratchet down. Noted Alex. Brown's Ray: "It seems to me one of the interesting unexplored areas is do investors today need to factor in price resistance from managed care buyers for novel therapeutics."<p>
Guessing how these new products will do on the market will be one of the key questions in 1996, said Purcell. "We haven't matured enough as an industry yet to develop a consensus on how to look at it."<p>
Whatever the reasons, negative surprises will occur, said Dovey, and it's the responsibility of companies and analysts to keep expectations within reasonable bounds. <p>
"That's where the new breed of analysts will have to be better at thinking about how drugs will be used," he said. "The responsibility of the sell side is to help set those expectations, and in general to set them lower than they've been in the past. I don't think there are that many analysts out there who are good at doing that. So when companies have great Phase III data, stocks will run ahead of themselves. <p>
"The issue of expectations and management is critical. If the industry can get that right, then we'll have a less volatile sector."<p>
