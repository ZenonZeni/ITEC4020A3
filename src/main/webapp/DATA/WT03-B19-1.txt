bit in W11. W12..W16 should be masked as they may be high.<BR>

The RAM size switch only need to be set once when memory is first installed.
All A/D modules connected to a control module should have the same amount
of memory installed in them. The RAM size switch is labeled &quot;RAM Size&quot;
and located on the control board.<BR>

<BR>
The RAM speed switches only need to be set once when memory is first installed.
The switches are labeled &quot;RAM Speed&quot; and located in the A/D module
on the memory board. These switches control the length of the write pulse
sent to the RAMs. The write pulse length is read directly from the value
set on the switches (in hex) plus an inherient 14ns. Pulse length is adjustable
from 14ns to 268ns in 2ns increments. The last bit of the setting is ignored.
Note that the most significant digit is right and that the least significant
digit is on the left. Some possible pulse lengths are shown as examples.<BR>

</TT><B>A/D Module Channel Assignment Switch Settings</B><BR>
<BR>
One control module can accomodate 4 A/D modules. Both the A/D module and
the control module are connected via a high density ribbon cable on the
back of the module. The modules may be placed in any order with the control
module placed on either end or in the middle. If less than 4 A/D modules
are being used, the empty spaces may also be placed in any position. A/D
modules are addressed by their A/D channel assignment switch setting which
is mislabeled &quot;RAM Size&quot; but correctly labeled &quot;SW1&quot;.
It is found in the A/D module on the memory board. Never assign the same
channels to more than one A/D module attached to the same control module.<BR>

Memory Size Pad Setting</B>s<BR>
<BR>
The pads undeneath the RAM on the A/D module are set to match the memory
size installed in the board. They select between power and address lines
sent to the memory chip's pins. To select between power and address, first
position the board so that the &quot;PAD101&quot; lettering is arranged
horizontally as you would read it. To select power on PADn01 or PADn03,
connect the center pad to the top half-circle pad; to select address, connect
the center pad to the bottom half-circle pad. For PADn02 or PADn04, the
reverse is true. The top pad is for address and the bottom pad is for power.
Although the controller board can access 16M words of memory, the A/D module
only has room to support from 4K words to 512K words.<BR>

system. Never connect more than one. Each pad provides 10ns of delay. Leave
set to pad3.<BR>

Programming Sequence<BR>
<BR>
F(17) A(0) W(x) Post Trigger Samples</B> This sets the amount of data points
taken after a stop trigger is received. For example F(17) A(0) W(13) sets
the digitizers so that 7/8 of the data points stored will be taken after
the stop trigger signal was received. If your total memory is 512KS/channel,
then 448K samples would be taken after the stop trigger signal.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(17) A(1) W(y) Sample Speed</B> This sets the digitizer sample rate.
For example F(17) A(1) W(59) sets the digitizers to 10 Mega Samples per
second. The external clock input can be selected by using an external clock
code. For example, F(17) A(1) W(132) uses the external clock input instead
of the internal clock. The external clock may be slowed internally for special
applications by selecting the proper code.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(18) A(ch) W(z) Input Voltage Selection</B> This selects the usable
range of input voltages. Every channel must be programmed separately. Each
module may have different voltage range programmed into each channel. For
example, the following commands set channel 0 to +/- 2V, channel 1 to +/-
5V, channel 3 and 4 to +/- 1V: F(18) A(0) W(12), F(18) A(1) W(8), F(18)
A(2) W(2), F(18) A(3) W(2). The second module uses channels 4 to 8 and so
on, up to channel 15 on the 4th module.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(10) Clear LAM</B> This clears the LAM flip-flop on the control module.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(26) Enable LAM</B> This enables the LAM on the control module so that
when the digitizers receive a stop trigger and finish digitizing, a LAM
is sent to the LAM Encoder Module. This does not clear the LAM. If the LAM
was previously set, an immediate interrupt will be generated.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(9) Start Digitizers</B> This starts the digitizers continuously sampling
and storing data in memory.<BR>
<BR>
<B>stop trigger or<BR>
F(25) Hardware or Software Trigger</B> This stops the digitizers after the
post trigger samples have been taken. The F(25) command and a TTL pulse
into the stop trigger input on the front of the control module work identically.
After the digitizer is completely finished taking data, the control module
LAM will be set. If the LAM has been enabled, this LAM will be sent onto
the dataway to the LAM Encoder Module.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(16) A(ch) Prepare to Read Data</B> This command selects the channel
number to be read. Channels may be read in any order and can be read more
than once. Each time the F(16) command is issued, the A/D module will begin
transmitting data from the beginning of the selected channel's memory, not
from where it left off last time.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(2) Read Data Word</B> This command is used to read back sequential
data points from the digitizer's memory. Q-stop mode is available, ie, valid
data will be signified by Q=1, invalid data by Q=0 (read past the end of
data.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(8) Check LAM</B> This puts the status of the LAM into Q even if the
LAM is not enabled.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(27) A(ch) Generate A/D LAM</B> This command will generate a LAM which
will come from the A/D module assigned to the specified channel. It is useful
for identifying which A/D channel is in which slot. For example, suppose
the controller module is in slot N=5 and 2 digitizer modules are in slots
N=3 and N=4. Then an F(27) A(0) might generate a LAM in slot N=4 signifying
that channel 0 to 3 were plugged into slot N=4. Remember that this and all
other command must be issued only to the controller module.<BR>
<BR>
<B>F(11) A(ch) Clear A/D LAM</B> This clears the LAM on the A/D module which
is assigned to the channel specified. Any of the 4 channels on that module
may be used interchangeably.<BR>
