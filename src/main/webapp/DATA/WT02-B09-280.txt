Dear Hunter:<BR>

I <I>am</I> sorry that it took so long to arrange for your release. I was stunned that the prosecutor requested bail of $5 million. I must say you didn't do yourself any favors when you locked yourself in your office during the search. Although now I know why you didn't want them to have access to your hard drive. Some of the files might be in violation of the Interstate Electronic Transmission of Smutty Images Act.<BR>

Here is the status of the case: Apparently, each of your previous three products contains hidden lines of code pertaining to the latest developments in a variety of esoteric scientific fields. In SumWare, for example, a user who knows the proper sequence of keyboard commands can access hidden functions that solve complex equations in bio-thermoplastics. (Strange, given that the original release of SumWare randomly converted decimal points to commas and added three zeros, making it difficult even to balance a checkbook.) <BR>

According to my sources, CIA operatives have found that an anti-government group in Hoezbagistan (see attached) is using these codes to develop sophisticated missiles for use against Western businesses, specifically targeting fast-food establishments. <BR>

Most of the materials seized last week will be returned tomorrow, except 1) records of Dede Thibodeau's trip through Central Asia last year; 2) all of the correspondence and technical work for the last two years from Victor Gooseggi and an employee named &quot;Chris&quot; (do you have any idea what Chris's last name is?); and 3) your hard drive. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometime in the next month, the FBI will want to speak with Victor and Chris. Prosecutors may request that Dede return to this country for questioning.<BR> 
In the meantime, you might want to see what you can find out about the hidden functionality in your products. And I'd suggest you confine your Internet surfing to sports and travel.<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>
