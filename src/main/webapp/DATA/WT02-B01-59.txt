<h2>Does DARE work? </h2>

<p><b>No.</b> All the major research on the effectiveness of DARE
shows that it has no impact on the rate of drug use by children
who go through DARE training. These reports include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>1991 Kentucky study - National Institute on Drug Abuse -
        &quot;No statistically significant differences&quot; </li>
    <li>1990 Canadian Government study &quot;DARE had no
        significant effect on the use of...marijuana, acid,
        heroin, crack, glue and PCP&quot; </li>
    <li>1993 Research Triangle Institute - National Institute of
        Justice - Statistical analysis of all DARE research,
        which says DARE has &quot;a limited to essentially
        non-existent effect&quot; on drug use. </li>
    <li>The final edition of the largest evaluation of the DARE
        program has concluded that the Anti-Drug program does not
        reduce drug use, and in at least category of pot, the
        DARE graduates smoked more frequently than the control.
        The report concluded: &quot;The DARE program's limited
        effect on adolescent drug use contrasts with the
        program's popularity and prevalence. An important
        implication is that DARE could be taking the place of
        other, more beneficial drug education programs that kids
        could be receiving&quot;How Effective is DARE, American
        Journal of Public Health Sept 1994 p1399 </li>
</ul>

<p>Among the notable quotations from researchers: * &quot;Its
well established that DARE doesn't work&quot; Gilbert Botvin -
Cornell Medical Center * &quot;Research shows that, no, DARE
hasn't been effective in reducing drug use&quot; William
Modzeleski, Top Drug education official at the Department of
Education </p>

<p>* &quot;I think the program should be entirely scrapped and
redeveloped anew.&quot; Dr. William Hansen, who helped design the
original DARE </p>

<p>And the DARE defenders - </p>

<ul>
    <li>Glenn Levant, executive director of DARE, called studies
        flawed, and suggested that we need to study the problem
        for the next seven years. He then said &quot;We're like
        apple pie&quot;. </li>
    <li>&quot;..surveys across the nation show kids who take the
        DARE course are much less likely to use drugs&quot;. Mike
        Muiller, police officer and DARE instructor, who may have
        unwittingly shown why DARE is failing. </li>
    <li>Michael Milken, famous junk bond king found guilty of
        securities fraud, was among the &quot;noted&quot;
        volunteers who show young kids how to live. </li>
</ul>

Directions of the D.A.R.E. Program: An Evaluation Review, </a>(380K

September 1994 </p>

<p>This is the study done by the Research Triangle Institute to
evaluate the effectiveness of the DARE drug-education program in
the schools. The basic conclusion was that DARE was highly
popular with both police and the school officials, but had no
real effect on long-term drug use. </p>
