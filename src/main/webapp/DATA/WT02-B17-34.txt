<B>Energy Pathway Analysis--Case Studies;<br>

Joseph S. Badin, Principal Investigator,<br>
Energetics, Incorporated</B>

<P>

Each potential hydrogen application has a variety of performance 
requirements 

and a unique set of competing energy systems.  The goal of this project 
is to provide DOE with 

an analytical framework that can be used to evaluate and screen hydrogen 
pathways by 

developing Energy, Economics, and Emissions (E3) Pathway and Network 
Analysis Models.  

The models are applied to specific case studies that are of interest to 
the DOE Hydrogen 

Program.  The E3 models provide a consistent basis by which we can 
evaluate and compare the 

life-cycle costs, primary energy requirements, and emission impacts of 
different energy systems.  

They also enable an objective and comprehensive assessment to be made of 
the near-, mid-, 

and long-term competitiveness of hydrogen systems in specific 
applications.

<P>

The E3 Pathway Analysis Model was developed to analyze energy systems 
that consist 

of a series of transformation steps (e.g., hydrogen production, storage, 
transportation, and use).  

The cost of capital equipment, annual operating costs, energy 
efficiency, and other performance 

data are estimated for each step and input to the model.  The model then 
calculates the capacity 

requirements and cost of each step per unit of energy consumed at the 
final stage.  In this way, 

the model determines the total amount of primary energy consumed (e.g., 
natural gas, biomass, 

or solar energy).  The model's output includes the energy system's total 
present worth, annual 

cost, and life-cycle cost.

<P>

The combined capabilities of the models provide the DOE Hydrogen Program 
with 

information to support future decision making.  The models ensure that 
all contributors to system 

cost, from primary energy consumption to end use, are considered when 
comparing different 

hydrogen technologies; they thus help to guide R&ampD efforts to the 
components that have 

greatest effect on the total cost of hydrogen systems.

<P>

<b><i>Recent Advances</i></b>:

<P>In 1996, Energetics performed a number of analysis tasks supporting

the Hydrogen Program.  We completed five detailed pathway analyses

in 1996.  These are summarized in the table, and the full reports

are contained in a compendium entitled <I>Independent Analysis

and Verification of Key Hydrogen Energy Concepts</I>, which was

distributed to the members of the Hydrogen Technical Advisory

Panel.

<P>

We revised the <I>Hydrogen Technology Cost and Performance Database</I>

to include additional data from equipment manufacturers, improved

units of measure, enhanced definitions of efficiencies and capital

cost bases, and additional data categories (e.g., membranes).

 In addition, the data base was moved to a Paradox platform to

facilitate the evaluation and updating of data and to enable future

linkage with the E-3 Pathway Analysis Model.

<tr><td width=50%>Municipal solid waste (MSW) is suspended in a 
water-based slurry and charged to a gasifier, producing hydrogen. <td 
width=50%>The low base-case cost of hydrogen ($8/MBtu) is due to the 
low-value feedstock.  Economics are strongly dependent on sustained 
tipping fees and MSW classification costs.</tr>

<tr><td width=50%>A large-scale geothermal electricity generation unit 
(100 MW) supplies full electricity service (both peak and baseload) to a 
load center.  Surplus electricity fuels an electrolyzer supplying 
hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles in the Los Angeles basin.<td 
width=50%>Waste heat from a geothermal unit makes it a good match with 
HTS electrolysis.  However, the cost of transporting hydrogen from remote 
geothermal sites is significant.  The scale of the project is large 
compared to vehicle penetration forecasts.</tr>

<tr><td width=50%>Distributed generation fuel cells are fueled by 
hydrogen from electrolyzers using surplus, off-peak electricity on the 
island of Hawaii.  The island setting is attractive because of high 
fossil fuel costs and large max/min load ratio.<td width=50%>Project 
requires commercially available hydrogen-fed fuel cells.  Location of the 
fuel cells at the load center can reduce peak-time reliance on 
transmission lines, improving reliability.  Low avoided costs for peak 
electricity limit this concept's viability.</tr>

<tr><td width=50%>Golf carts are retrofitted with a 4-kW PEM fuel cell 
and used for personal transportation in the city of Palm Desert, 
California.  Hydrogen fuel is produced by a wind-turbine/electrolysis 
system.<td width=50%>Low-pressure PEM technology eliminates the need for 
the on-board air compressor, which is important for small vehicles.  
Battery-electric vehicles are well suited for the low-range golf cart 
application.</tr>

<tr><td width=50%>Revised analysis of the integrated electricity storage 
and hydrogen production system incorporating a solar-powered HBr reactor 
and a reversible HBr cell.<td width=50%>Pathway model has been revised.  
Analysis will be completed after results from the 10 kW pilot plant test 
are available.</tr></table>
