<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>
