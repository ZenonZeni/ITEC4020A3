<H1>Hal Thurston</H1><P>HAL THURSTON is a trial attorney who handles a general civil trial practice.  Primary areas of
focus include both insurance defense and plaintiff's personal injury, as well as professional
negligence.  Hal is an aggressive litigator with a calm and professional style.  A graduate of Ohio
State University (1970) and Georgetown University Law School (1974), Hal is a member of the
Washington State Trial Lawyers Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, and the
Washington Defense Trial Lawyers.  He has taught litigation skills to other lawyers at the
National Institute of Trial Advocacy.
<P>
Hal has been successful in scores of jury trials and arbitrations throughout Northwestern
Washington.  He has tried cases in Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, King, Island and San Juan
Counties, plus the Federal District Court.  In a prior incarnation he tried medical malpractice
cases in Washington, D.C.  The subject matter of Hal's cases is equally varied.

<LI> He was the lead attorney representing a group of dairy farmers in a 6.5 week trial that resulted
in a $2.9 million verdict.<P>  

<LI> Recently he successfully defended a consortium of municipalities who were sued for their
sewage disposal practices.  Their dismissal was affirmed in the appellate court.   Zander v.
Whatcom County, 128 Wn.2d 1015, 911 P.2d 1343 (1996).<P>

<LI> Representing the defense in a one car automobile accident case in which his client (the driver)
had been killed, Hal persuaded a jury that the plaintiff/passenger who was either asleep or passed
out at the time of the accident was 70% at fault for his own injuries, and therefore was entitled to
recover nothing.  The Court of Appeals reversed, but the Supreme Court reinstated the defense
verdict.  Geschwind v. Flanagan, 121 Wn.2d 833, 854 P.2d 1061 (1993).<P>
     
<LI> Hal has frequently litigated insurance coverage issues.  Stoughton v. Mutual of Enumclaw, 61
Wn. App. 365, 810 P.2d 80 (1991), established that the "business pursuits" exclusion found in a
homeowner's policy excludes coverage for casual daylabor, reversing an earlier summary 
judgment against the insurer.<P>

<LI> Several significant medical malpractice suits have been tried or settled for claimants,
sometimes before suit has been filed.  Boundary law suits have been tried in several different
counties.  Both claimants and manufacturers have employed Hal in products liability suits.
