Here's the hemp 100 from last October in which I got my daughter's birthday mentioned. 
She does have a cool birthday - April 20th - or 4:20!!  She was born at 4:02 AM, almost a 
double 4:20. I thought of asking my wife to hold off for eighteen minutes, but seeing that 
she had been in labor for twenty-six hours already, I thought better of it.
<p>
Anyway, check out number 27.
