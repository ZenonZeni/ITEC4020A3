<H2><A NAME="intestine">Intestinal</A> Health-Why Getting Specific about Your Carbohydrates Can  Restore It</H2>


If you suffer from any of the intestinal scourges such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's 
disease, diverticulitis, spastic colon, chronic diarrhea, severe constipation, or 
celiac disease, and think there is no cure, you're wrong, says Elaine Gottschall, M.Sc. Ever 
since she watched her own 4-year-old daughter get over ulcerative colitis 40 years ago, 
Gottschall has been restoring intestinal health for hundreds of sufferers. 
<P>She calls her approach the Specific Carbohydrate Diet and it's based on the 
pioneering work of the late Sidney V. Haas, M.D. According to Gottschall, the diet's 
success rate is excellent, achieving an 80% recovery rate for Crohn's disease and 95% 
for diverticulitis. Patients following this diet for as little time as 3 weeks will 
see marked improvement, says Gottschall. 
<P>In brief, the cause of the various intestinal illnesses listed above is an
imbalanced relationship between carbohydrates and intestinal microbes. When
the system gets unbalanced, bacteria multiply and food absorption declines,
producing a "vicious cycle" that can last for years and produce ill health.
The body becomes unable to digest carbohydrates because of microbial
overgrowth and toxins; then, numerous illnesses develop out of this altered
intestinal milieu as the system grows unable to digest most of the standard
Western diet.

<HR WIDTH=85%>
<P>Here are the highlights of Gottschall's Specific Carbohydrate
Diet. "It is unwise to undertake this regimen unless you are willing to
follow it with fanatical adherence," Gottschall advises. Proteins to Avoid:
Processed meats, breaded or canned fish, processed cheeses, smoked or
canned meats. 
<UL><LI><B>Proteins Allowed:</B> Fresh or frozen meats, poultry,
fish, eggs, natural cheeses, homemade yogurt, dry curd cottage cheese.
<LI><B>Foods to Avoid:</B> All cereal grains in any form, including flour;
potatoes, yams, parsnips, chick peas, bean sprouts, soybeans, mungbeans,
faba and garbanzo beans, seaweeds. 
<LI><B>Vegetables Allowed:</B> Most fresh or
frozen (but not canned) vegetables and legumes.
<LI><B>Fruits Allowed:</B> Fresh,
raw, dried, or cooked, but not canned (except in their own juices). 
<LI><B>Not Permitted:</B> Fluid milk of any kind or dried milk solids; buttermilk or
acidophilus milk; commercially prepared yogurt and sour cream; soymilk;
instant tea or coffee, coffee substitutes; beer; cornstarch, arrowroot, or
other starches; chocolate or carob; bouillon cubes or instant soup bases;
any products made with refined sugar; agar-agar, carageenan, or pectin;
ketchup; ice cream, molasses, corn or maple syrup; flours made from
legumes; baking powder; medications containing sugar; all seeds.
</UL>
By rigidly
following this diet for 3 months, "many cases of celiac disease, spastic
colon, and diverticulitis appear to be cured at the end of a year,"
Gottschall says.

<H2>How to Be <A NAME="Up">Up</A> When You Need to Be</H2> 

Male erectile dysfunction, or the
inability to achieve a full erection during sexual arousal, affects an
estimated 10-20 million men, including 25% of men older than 50. For men
aged 50 and older, in 85% of cases, organic factors such as vascular
disease and atherosclerosis of the penile artery are the cause of erectile
problems, states naturopathic physician Michael T. Murray, N.D. Here's what
Dr. Murray recommends:  
<UL><LI><B>Yohimbe Bark.</B> This herb contains yohimbine, a
substance that increases blood flow to erectile tissue. Studies indicate
yohimbe produces  results in 34-43% of cases, although it has occasional
unpleasant to moderately serious side effects. Specific dosage depends on
the yohimbine content of the supplement.

<LI><B>Muira Pauma.</B> This Brazilian
herb is also known as potency wood. A French study involving 262 men with

in erections.<A NAME="Gink"> </A>  
<LI><B>Gingko Biloba.</B> In Europe, over 5 million prescriptions
for Ginkgo are written annually for many health problems. In a study, 60
male patients with "erection failures" took 60 mg daily for 12-18 months;
improvement was noted in 6-8 weeks and after 6 months of this treatment,
50% of the men had regained their erectile potency. Dr. Murray recommends
120 mg daily, in 3 doses of 40 mg each.  
<LI><B>Avoid:</B> Prescription
medications that lower blood pressure such as beta-blockers and calcium
channel blockers and long-term alcohol and tobacco consumption are
associated with erectile problems.  
<LI><B>Embrace:</B> Optimal nutrition through
a whole-foods, low-fat diet, with adequate high-quality fish, chicken, and
turkey protein is preferable. Niacin (1500-3000 mg daily) will help to
lower cholesterol. "Virility foods" high in zinc, such as liver, oysters,
yams, wheat germ, spinach, oranges, brown rice, nuts, seeds, legumes, and
garlic, are a good idea, says Dr. Murray, as is  vigorous exercise for 60
minutes, 3-4 days a week.

<H2>Natural Relief from <A NAME="Fibro">Fibromyalgia</A></H2> 

Fibromalygia Syndrome is a poorly
understood disorder that primarily affects women between the ages of 30 and
50. Typical symptoms include widespread muscle pain, debilitating fatigue,
sleeping disorders, reduced coordination, mental confusion, diarrhea or
constipation. Physicians, who have known of fibromyalgia since 1904, tend
to classify it as a painful arthritic condition and prescribe various
painkillers but they see no cure in sight. 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=85%>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>Leaner men live longer, says a Harvard School of Public Health 
poll of 19,000 men. Those men with the lowest mortality rate weighed 20%

the ideal body weight had a 2.5 times higher risk for cardiovascular disease.</B></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=85%>
<P>However, that's not the way
alternative medicine practitioner Christiane Northrup, M.D., sees it. In
Dr. Northrup's view, fibromyalgia has an emotional element such that
negative feelings of despair and resentment, from job stress, family
problems, or even childhood memories, get "trapped" in the muscles and
constrict them. To release these trapped emotions from the muscles, Dr.
Northrup recommends:  
<UL><LI><B>Gladly Exercise.</B> Even though it seems you can't
move your muscles, you must keep moving every day; your pain will actually
diminish as you build a consistent exercise program.  
<LI><B>Rest and Relax.</B>
Sleep 8-10 hours nightly, go to bed before 10 pm and get up at the same
time every morning.  
<LI><B>Meditate.</B> Even 15 minutes a day will help balance
your brain chemicals, or neurotransmitters.  
<LI><B>Balance the Prostaglandins.</B> Keep your prostaglandin hormone levels in 
balance by eating
no more than 500 calories per meal; keep your diet low in refined
carbohydrates and fats, and moderate in protein. 
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=85%>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../images/quik-def.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=116 HEIGHT=89>QUICK DEFINITION: <B>Prostaglandin</B> is a hormone-like fatty acid, produced in the uterus, brain, kidneys,
and semen, that produces a wide range of effects including smooth muscle function. 
<BR CLEAR=ALL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=85%>

<LI><B>Increase Your Serotonin.</B> Use blue-green algae in a progressive, 
4-week supple-mentation
program to enhance levels of this important neurotransmitter. First week:
Take 2 Cell-Tech digestive enzymes with Alpha Sun or Omega Sun blue-green
algae capsules before breakfast and lunch. Also take 2 capsules of
acidophilus with algae 30 minutes before breakfast. Second week: Add to
this one capsule of Alpha Sun and Omega Sun before breakfast. Third week:
Continue this while increasing the algae intake to 2-4 capsules 3 times
daily with meals. Fourth week: Continue with this regime, increasing the
algae if necessary. This will increase your serotonin levels and have an
antidepressant effect.

another $2000 in fees, says the Journal of the American Medical Association.

You should notice a difference and good
results in 3-6 weeks, advises Dr. Northrup. A study by Guy D. Abraham,
M.D., and Jorge D. Flechas, M.D.,  showed that 15 patients with
fibromyalgia who took  magnesium (300-600 mg daily) and malic acid
(1200-2400 mg daily) experienced subjective improvement in their symptoms
within the first 48 hours. Over an 8-week period of supplementation, their
degree of muscle tenderness and pain dropped from 19.6 to 6.5, according to
medical scores. 
<P>British naturopath Harald Gaier notes that 21 of 26
fibromyalgia patients experienced reduced pain and general improvement
after receiving massage, and that 24 patients taking one of three
homeopathic remedies (Arnica, Bryonia, or Rhus tox) also had improvement,
as did 35 patients receiving electro-acupuncture.
