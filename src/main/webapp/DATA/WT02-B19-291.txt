<B>March 28, 1995<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>EDUCATION RESCISSIONS<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
     On March 16, the House passed H.R. 1158 that would rescind $1.7 billion in education funding for FY 1995, and would rescind $4.6 million in the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act, the only federal program that specifically targets the education of gifted students.<P>
     The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its rescission package bill on March 24, rescinding over $700 million in education programs; unfortunately, the Committee's bill would also rescind $4.6 million in the Javits gifted and talented program.  The bill will go to the Senate floor sometime early this week.    We continue to urge CEC members to contact their Senators and Representatives and urge that funding for the Javits gifted and talented programs be restored when the Senate and House bills are conferenced.  <BR>
  <B><BR>
<CENTER>CHILD NUTRITION BLOCK GRANTS<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
</B>     As part of the overall welfare reform efforts in the House, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities reported H.R. 999 on March 10. The bill would consolidate 10 federal food and nutrition programs into 2 block grants.  The school-based nutrition block grant would consolidate funding from  school breakfast and lunch programs, low cost milk, part of Child and Adult Care Food programs, and part of the Summer Food program. A family nutrition block grant would consolidate funding for WIC, part of the Child and Adult Care Food program, part of the Summer Food program and Homeless Children Nutrition Program. <P>
     The consolidation will significantly change the way the current school breakfast and lunch programs operate.  The funding for the programs will be combined and will not be allocated on a per meal basis.  Instead, the school-based nutrition block grant will operate as a "capped entitlement."  State allocations will be based upon previous year's participation in first year, and then based on number of meals served compared to other states.  The bill would fund the block grant at $6.7 billion for FY 1996. The block grant will allow a funding increase of 4.5 percent a year for a total of $7.8 billion in FY 2000. Unfortunately, the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the block grant would need to grow at an increase of 5.2 percent to keep pace with the number of children who will qualify for school-based meals. States will only be required to use not less than 80 percent for low-income children.<BR>
     <BR>
     The provisions in H.R. 999 are part of the "Personal Responsibility Act," H.R. 4, which passed the House on March 24.  The Senate will now be taking a look at  the House bill.<P>

<CENTER><B>SSI FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES</B> <BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     Another part of the welfare reform package would drastically change assistance to low-income children with disabilities.  The Personal Responsibility Act, H.R. 4, would change the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for children.<P>
     Currently, low-income children who are blind or have a severe disability or a chronic illness can receive monthly checks of up to $458, depending on family income.  Almost half of the States provide additional cash to children who qualify.  Most children are also eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, and other social services. A family of four can earn up to $30,168 a year and still be eligible for SSI.  The number of children receiving disability benefits under the SSI program has more than doubled (from 296,298 to 624,000) since the Supreme Court decision in the <I>Sullivan v. Zebley</I> case in February of 1990.  That decision changed the criteria under which children with impairments are evaluated for disability benefit eligibility.  <P>
     The <I>Zebley</I> decision requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to go beyond previous disability criteria and to assess the child's ability to do things that another child of a similar age can do. The definition of disability for SSI eligibility currently requires that a child have a physical or mental impairment that is expected to last at least one year and substantially reduces the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively when compared with other children of the same age, or is expected to result in death. If a disability cannot be found solely on medical grounds (meeting a listing), the SSA must evaluate how the impairment affects the child's ability to function.  This is called an individualized functional assessment.  If the assessment shows that the child does much less than expected in one area or is moderately restricted in several areas of development or functioning, the child is considered disabled and can be eligible for SSI.  Parents can provide evidence from doctors and teachers to determine eligibility.  This made it possible to go beyond the specific requirements of SSA's listing of impairments.<P>
     Amid calls of fraudulent claims and television programs profiling questionable recipients of SSI, Congress passed legislation last year that established a Commission to look into the SSI program and report to Congress by November of 1995.  Instead of waiting for the Commission's findings, the Republican leadership has crafted legislation that will severely change the program.  The changes in H.R. 4 include:<U><P>
</U>&iuml;     instead of the SSA providing direct benefits to eligible recipients, the bill creates a block grant program to give grants to States that would then provide medical and non-medical services to low-income children with disabilities.  States could choose which services to finance from a list of allowable services;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     the bill eliminates the Individualized Functional Assessment as a basis for eligibility; <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     in order to be eligible for services, a child who is currently receiving services would have to have an impairment that meets or equals an impairment specified in the SSA listing of impairments to continue to receive services;<BR>
&iuml;     for new recipients to receive cash benefits, a child with a disability must have an impairment that meets or equals an impairment specified in the SSA listing of impairments, <U>and</U> has a disability so severe that the child is institutionalized or would require institutionalization if the child were not receiving personal assistance required by the impairment.<BR>
<BR>
     According to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates, there will be 500,000 child recipients of SSI cash benefits in FY 2000 as a result of the above changes to SSI, in contrast to 1.25 million children if SSI was left unchanged.<P>
     CEC is urging Congress to wait for the Congressionally established Commission to report its findings on possible SSI fraud.  Despite media reports of SSI malfeasance, federal reports on the SSI program convey little evidence of fraud.  CEC believes Congress was acting responsibly to establish a Commission to look at the overall program and needs to wait for the results of the investigation before making substantial changes in the SSI program that could result in denying children with disabilities critical benefits.          <U>     <BR>

 <B>PROPOSAL TO CONSOLIDATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AND LABOR<BR>
</B><BR>
     On February 15, Congressmen Steve Gunderson (R-WI) and Bill Goodling (R-PA)introduced a proposal to consolidate the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC)into one Department of Education and Employment. According to the sponsors, the proposal would save over $21 billion over five years through administrative and program reduction made possible through consolidation.<P>
     The Department would be organized around three basic functions:<P>
*     Workforce Preparation and Policy:  incorporates most education and adult training<BR>
     programs;<P>
*     Civil Rights: incorporates all aspects of enforcement of employment discrimination laws;<BR>
     and<P>
*     Workplace Policy: focuses on safety, employee benefits, and workplace modernization. <P>
     Education functions under the Workforce Preparation and Policy would be organized into three offices: Office of Basic Education, Office of Higher Education, and Office of Workforce Preparation and Life-long Learning. No separate office would be maintained for students with exceptionalities.  No action has been scheduled at any level in either the U.S. House or Senate on restructuring of the current Departments of Education and Labor as this PAN mailing went to press.<BR>

<CENTER>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
     The Senate Subcommittee on Disability has released a schedule for the reauthorization of IDEA.  The plan is to immediately introduce a simple one-year extension of IDEA, Parts C through H so that they do not expire on October 1, 1995.  Part B is permanently authorized and will not expire.  In May, the subcommittee will conduct two days of informational hearings on the education of students with disabilities.  There will also be four days of informational briefings for the staff of Members in June.  The briefings will be conducted by interest groups, experts, and federal officials on issues that should be addressed during reauthorization.  In the fall, a bill to reauthorize IDEA will be introduced and the subcommittee will have two days of hearings on the specify bill.  The bill is expected to pass the Senate floor by Thanksgiving recess.<P>
     The House is expected to begin considering the reauthorization in May.  It is unclear at this point whether the House will also pass an extension bill before considering a reauthorization bill.  Stay tuned...<B><BR>
<CENTER> </B><BR>
<B>REGULATORY REFORMS<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
</B>     Included in the <I>Contract With America</I> is proposed legislation that would drastically reform the regulatory process.  The House has acted on two bills that would affect regulations. The House bill, H.R. 450, would impose a regulatory moratorium that would be retroactive to November 25. The Senate has a companion bill, S. 219, that had passed the Governmental Affairs Committee.  The bills would bar federal agencies from proposing or issuing most regulations before December 31 or whenever a comprehensive regulatory overhaul bill is enacted. S. 219 would also be retroactive to November 9 and would only apply to regulations expected to cost $100 million or more.  <P>
     Another regulatory reform bill passed by the House is H.R. 1022, which would require risk assessments and cost benefit analyses before federal regulations are issued. The Senate companion bill, S. 343, is expected to be voted on the Senate floor after the Easter Recess. The regulatory proposals in the bills will make it much more difficult for regulations to be issued. <P>
<CENTER><B>UNFUNDED MANDATE LEGISLATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     The conference version of unfunded mandate legislation passed both the House and Senate earlier this month, and was signed into law by President Clinton on March 22, P.L. 104-4.  <P>
     The law requires a bill or amendment imposing a federal mandate of more than $50 million on a state or local government, or $200 million on the private sector, to include an estimation of the cost and specify the money or taxes to pay for it.  If the bill is to be paid for with a subsequent appropriation, the bill must stipulate that the mandate will expire if it is not funded or will be scaled back if the appropriation is less than anticipated.  Legislation that is brought to the floor and does not include these provisions will be subject to a point of order.  If a point of order is brought against the bill, a majority of Members would have to vote to continue to consider the legislation; otherwise the bill would be sent back to the originating committee.  <BR>
     The law would only affect prospective legislation.  Legislation that is reauthorized will not have to comply with the provisions in the bill, unless funds are reduced for existing mandates, or new mandates are added that will cost a net increase of $50 million on state or local governments, or $200 million on the private sector.  Also included in the bill are provisions that exempt any legislation that "enforces Constitutional rights of individuals; or establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, or handicapped or disability status".<P>
<CENTER><B>PAN MEETING AT INDY!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     As we mentioned in previous mailings, we'll be holding a PAN meeting during the CEC Convention in Indianapolis.  The date?  <B>April 6, 1995</B>.  The time?  <B>12:30 to 2:00 p.m</B>.  The place?  <B>Grand 3, 2nd floor of the Westin Hotel. </B> <P>
     At the meeting, we'll provide you with any updates on legislation that occurs after you receive this PAN mailing.  And, since everyone should already have completed his or her Congressional Visits, we'd like to discuss the PAN Congressional Visits Campaign, and get your input about whether you thought the Campaign was successful.  If you had trouble arranging your visits, let us know why.  If you thought the Campaign in general wasn't successful, please be ready to discuss some possible reasons -- as well as some possible solutions!<P>
<CENTER><B>SESSION ON THE <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I> AT INDY!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>REMINDER</B>:  On Saturday, April 8, from 3:45 to 4:45 p.m. in Room 212 of the Convention Center, Jacki Bootel, DPP's Policy Specialist for Field Operations, will be conducting a session to help familiarize you with the new <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I>.  She'll discuss how you can fit the <I>Handbook'</I>s contents into your current training programs, and will give you an opportunity to let her know what other types of training materials you might need in order to more effectively teach CEC members to be more effective advocates!  Join Jacki for this helpful session -- and bring your federation/division officers or any interested members as well!<P>
<CENTER><B>SUMMER PAN COORDINATORS MEETING</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     We hope you are enjoying a beautiful spring, but it is time to begin focusing on another summer meeting of the CEC-PAN network!  You will once again have the opportunity to experience summer in our Nation's Capital during our <B>PAN WASHINGTON WORKSHOP</B>.  <P>
     We have a number of legislative issues pending in the Congress this year that will affect you, and the students with exceptionalities that we advocate for (e.g., the future of the Javits gifted and talented program, IDEA reauthorization, FY 1995 and 1996 budget issues, rescission bills, unfunded mandates legislation, and welfare reform [including the SSI program]).  As usual, the Workshop will not only provide additional opportunities for training and idea/information exchange, but will also give us yet another opportunity to interact with our lawmakers and public officials on behalf of exceptional children.<BR>
     We have set <B>July 23-25, 1995</B> -- Sunday through Tuesday -- as the dates for the meeting.   Please check your calendars and see if you'll be free during this time.  Please plan to attend the workshop!!  Mark your calendars NOW!!!
