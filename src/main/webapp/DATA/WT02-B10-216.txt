A few changes in staff occurred in 1994. Barbara Erwin McGuire, Ph.D. left her position as the social worker on the ECT research project and Late Life Depression Clinic and was replaced by Shoshana Peyser, C.S.W. at the end of the year. Grant Stitt, C.S.W. resigned his position as social worker on the inpatient Washington Heights Community Service unit. Two new bilingual staff members have joined the Community Service. Quisqueya Meyreles, C.S.W., who trained as a social work intern in the Inwood Clinic during the 1993-1994 academic year, joined the Audubon and Inwood Clinics. Shane McGrail, C.S.W. was hired to replace Mr. Stitt on the inpatient community service.

In addition to continuing her assignment as social worker in the Memory Disorders Clinic, Bobba Moody, C.S.W. has joined Shoshana Peyser, C.S.W. and Nancy Turret, C.S.W. in the Late Life Depression Clinic, which continued to experience a growth in its patient population and numbers of research protocols over the year. In the clinic, the social workers provide structured interviews and ratings of research subjects as well as assist in recruitment, evaluation, and referral of patients.

The outpatient community clinics also experienced a growth in census, not only in the new MICA program at Inwood, but throughout the clinics and day programs.

On the inpatient research units, staff continued their clinical assignments to provide assessment, treatment, and discharge planning for patients and their families and as supervisors of social work trainees in all aspects of clinical social work. Many staff also serve as cotherapists with and/or supervisors of residents and other staff and trainees in family or group treatment. Some highlights of the year 1994 in these areas were the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy group for eating disorder patients co-led by Carla Sadik, C.S.W. and Barbara Bouley, M.A., O.T.R./L, C.S.W. Ms. Sadik also continued to develop her eating disorder lunch/shopping group, which challenges these patients to practice normal eating in restaurants outside of the hospital and to deal with their changed bodies by trying on clothing appropriate to their increased body habitus as they approach their target weights. This group provides a forum for dealing with the many body-image and self-esteem problems presented by these patients.

On the Schizophrenia Research Unit, Ellen Lukens, Ph.D. and Helle Thorning, C.S.W. have continued their research in the effectiveness of psychoeducational multiple family groups for this disorder. Ms. Thorning is also studying the impact of schizophrenia on family life with a focus on the experience of loss and its effect on siblings. Dr. Lukens has also provided supervision for other unit staff on psychosocial research and for the multiple family group on the Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit. Ms. Thorning and Dr. Lukens have also continued to present their research and to conduct workshops at other facilities and at the Annual Schizophrenia Conference for families and consumers hosted by the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry.

Two new groups led by social workers in the outpatient clinics include a parenting group in the Audubon Clinic led by Cynthia Kolbowski, C.S.W. and a Latino Women's Group led by Quisqueya Meyreles, C.S.W. which utilized a culturally sensitive mixture of films, short stories, music, and food to address common themes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the Memory Disorders Clinic, Bobba Moody, C.S.W. and Deborah Thorne, C.S.W. initiated a support and educational group for caregivers and family members of Alzheimer's patients. Ms. Moody served on two panels at meetings outside the Institute: "The Scientist-Practitioner" at the annual meeting of the New York State Society of Clinical Social Work and "Social and Economic Issues Related to Parkinson's Disease" at the Parkinson's Disease International Symposium.

The social work student program continues to be highly sought after. In the 1993-1994 academic year, 16 students were placed at Psychiatric Institute for the practicum during the second year of their Masters in Social Work program. Our ten-week long summer internship was also highly subscribed, with six students and one new M.S.W. graduate completing the placement for which students at Hunter and New York University Schools of Social Work receive academic credit. In the fall of 1994, 17 students began their second-year placements in the department.
