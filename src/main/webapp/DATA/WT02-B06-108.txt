<H1>Victory in the CDA Case!</H1>
<P>
On Wednesday June 12 at 9:00 am, a panel of three federal judges in Philadelphia, PA granted the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition's (CIEC) request for a preliminary injunction against the Communications Decency Act (CDA). In a unanimous decision, the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on the Internet.

<H2>Why WAS this page black?</H2>
<p>
On Thursday Feb 1, 1996, Congress approved legislation to dramatically restrict the First Amendment rights of Internet users.  With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally available today in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on World Wide Web sites or usenet newsgroups. With the stroke of President Clinton's pen, this bill transformed the Internet overnight from the freest communications medium to the most heavily regulated medium in the United States.
<p>
The measure, known as the <a href = "cda.html">Communications Decency Act</a>,  was part of a massive telecommunications reform bill which President Clinton signed into law Thursday Feb. 8, 1996.  In response, <a href = "#orgs">The Coalition to Stop Net Censorship</a> 
asked everyone, everywhere, to turn their World Wide Web pages black to show just  how broadly these new restrictions will  impact the Internet.  The protest was a tremendous succe
ss.  It received coverage in virtually every story about the President signing the Telecommunications Reform bill in national and regional newspapers, radio programs, and televison such as CNN, Headline News, and ABC news.
<p>
<a href = "black_links.html">Over 1500  Web Sites Participated in the 
Protest</a>, including: <ul> 
<li><a href  ="http://www.senate.gov/~leahy">Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT)</a>
