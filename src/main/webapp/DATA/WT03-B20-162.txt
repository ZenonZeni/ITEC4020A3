<H1>Review of European Union Legislative Issues: January - June 1996</H1>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>


<H2>Authenticity</H2>

<H3>Official Control of Foodstuffs</H3>

<P>A question raised by  Gerhard Schmid in the European Parliament (Official Journal 96/C 9/48 of 15.1.96 ) on the official control of foodstuffs Directive  elicited the response from the Commission that the Coca-Cola Company are technically obliged to divulge details of their formulae.  </P>


<H3>Fraud</H3>

<P>The European Commission has issued a proposal (COM 95 690 ) for a Regulation to enable them to make spot checks and inspections for the detection of frauds and irregularities to back up the efforts made by the member states in this area.  It has been suggested that the Commission is taking action because of the apparent ineffectiveness of the member states in combatting fraud.</P>


<H3>Chocolate</H3>

<P>After three years of prevarication, the Commission has finally adopted proposals to streamline unwieldy legislation in 7 vertical foodstuffs Directives.  The proposals have been held up because of the difficulty in reaching agreement on the definition of chocolate. Europe is fairly evenly split on what constitutes chocolate.  One half believes it should contain no other fat than cocoa butter while the other half believe that up to 5% of other vegetable fat is necessary to meet market conditions, particularly in the hotter climates. A compromise has been reached allowing chocolate products containing up to 5% vegetable fats as a substitute for cocoa butter but they will have to carry a label saying so.  Member states can still deny their national manufacturers the right to use vegetable fats but they cannot deny market access to imported chocolate.  This compromise proposal is likely to secure a qualified majority in Council but under the co-decision procedure it could have problems in the European Parliament.</P>


<H3>Specification Loophole</H3>

<P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that national product specifications are unenforceable if the national government has not given copies of all the technical rules that it adopts to the Commission.  Thus national courts have been advised to ensure that national standards have been deposited with the Commission before proceeding with local infringements.</P>


<H3>Contaminants</H3>

<P>The European Commission has published in the Official Journal L64 the Recommendation 96/199/EU on the 1996 coordinated programme of inspection to comply with maximum pesticide residue levels in foodstuffs.</P>

<P>The Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion (96/C 82/01) on the proposed Directive (95/C 201/07) amending Directive 76/363/EEC on the maximum levels of pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables, Directive 86/362/EEC on cereals, Directive 86/363/EEC on products of animal origin, and Directive 90/642/EEC on products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables.</P>

<P>The draft Directive, 96/C 87/02 on integrated pollution prevention and control has reached the common position stage.  It will now go to the European Paliament for its second reading through the co-decision process.</P>

<P>Member of the European Parliament, Amedeo Amadeo, was assured on asking about the unauthorised use of pesticides in agriculture that the system was indeed under control (96/C 112/19). </P>


<HR>

<H2>Consumer Protection</H2>

<H3>Consumer Power</H3>

<P>When Emma Bonino was appointed the European Commissioner for Consumer Affairs she was shocked at the low status of consumer matters within the Commission.  She is determined to simplify the resolution of individual consumer complaints and announced plans to launch discussions on an action plan for this area.  To this end, she is shepherding a Directive to give consumers equal access to justice in all EU member states.  There would be mutual recognition of consumer associations which would be able to represent European citizens before the courts in any of the 15 member states.  The Directive will affect advertising and consumer credit.  Bonino sees this as an important step in fostering the citizen's belief in belonging to the EU.  Understandably the European Consumers  Council (BEUC) in Brussels is pleased.  Member states will have to designate their approved consumer associations and notify  the Commission who will ensure publication in the Official Journal.   The proposals for the Directive are published in Commission document  COM 95 712.   The Economic and Social Committee gave its opinion on the proposed legislation in the Official Journal 96/C 39/12 of 12.2.96, and the proposed revised Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of Member States relating to injunctions for the protection of consumers interests was published in the Official Journal 96/C 107/03 of 13.4.96.</P>

<H3>Action Plan</H3>

<P>A proposed  action plan (Communication from the Commission, COM 96 13) proposed on 14 February complementing the above legislation aims to encourage amicable resolution of conflicts by offering a working plan for a voluntary system of additional legal help for handling consumer complaints.  A simplified form something like the one used to report car accidents, is proposed to facilitate individual consumer-related disputes in the EU.  A legal action guide is already available on the Internet to enhance legal protection for European consumers.  This is a stage two sequel from the draft Directive (COM 95 712) initiated by the Commission in January of this year aimed at protecting consumers' collective interests by the mutual recognition of cross border legal actions.</P>

<H3>Unit Pricing</H3>

<P>The Council reached a Common Position on 23 April on the Proposed Directive on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers. The Directive will replace three earlier Directives 79/581/EEC  as amended by 88/315/EEC and 88 314/EEC.  It has not yet been published in the Official Journal but the European Parliament has already considered it and put forward amendments.  The Directive will require the indication of both the selling price and the price per unit of measurement of most products offered by traders to consumers to improve consumer information and to facilitate comparison of prices.  There are openings for derogations for street traders, small businesses, for products for which the Directive would be inappropriate, etc.  The Economic and Social Committee put forward its comments on the proposed legislation in the Official Journal 96/C 82/08 of 19.3.96.  But European MP, Riccardo Garasci,  in a question (96/C 66/136) to the Commission asserted that the multiplicity of prices confronting the consumer will only mislead.</P>


<H3>Open Forum on Consumer Policy</H3>

<P>A three year plan on  protection of the consumer will focus on quality, information and openness. At a ministerial open forum, four of ten main issues discussed were:   protecting consumers from unscrupulous financial services traders;   getting better quality of service from the public utilities;  facilitating access to new technologies for the information society;    and restoring public confidence in food products following the mad cow scare.  The lone dissenting voice was the British Minister who regretted the unnecessary burden imposed on industry by yet more Community intervention. </P>

<HR>

<H2>Food Additives</H2>

<H3>Miscellaneous Additives</H3>
<P>The Commission is drafting an amendment to the Miscellaneous Additives Directive (Commission Document COM 96 212).  A draft was circulated by the UK government to interested parties in January. The three additive Directives (sweeteners, colours, and miscellaneous) are now more or less adopted in practice throughout the EU, except France and Portugal.</P>


<H3>Flavourings for use in Foodstuffs</H3>

<P>A basis for compiling a list of approved flavourings and procedues for the use of such flavours in foodstuffs has been reached.  A regulation to effect was adopted on 25 June 1996.  The common position stage was published in the Official Journal 96/C 59/03 of 28.2.96. </P>


<H3>Derogation on the use of Additives</H3>

<P>Some Member States have insisted on  maintaining national laws prohibiting the use of additives in certain foodstuffs.  An amended proposal for a Decision to regularise this has been published, COM 96 50, and a common position was adopted on 18 June 1996.   Similar products from other member states containing additives permitted by EU law cannot be denied access to those markets.  Thus for products which benefit from the inclusion of an additive, the restrictive member states are effectively hindering their own industry.</P>


<H3>Sweeteners Directive</H3>

<P>The amendment to the Sweeteners Directive has reached the Common Position.  The amendments are a tidying up operation and make no major changes  - there are no new sweeteners included.    Throughout the Annex, the definition of "breakfast cereals" has been modified to include a minimum threshold of 15% fibre (the 20% minimum bran remains).  Three categories of permitted foods, breakfast cereals, energy reduced soups, and distilled drinks containing less than 15% alcohol, have been deleted from that part of the Annex covering cyclamate.  For the use of cyclamate in the category "food supplements/diet integrators based on vitamins and or mineral elements, syrup-type or chewable" the maximum permitted level has been reduced from 2000 mg/kg to 1250 mg/kg cyclamate.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Food Imports</H2>

<H3>Edible Oils</H3>

<P>For the transport of bulk edible oils and fats by sea, there has been a derogation  (96/3/EU published on 27.1.96 in Official Journal L 21) from the hygiene of foodstuffs Directive 93/43/EU.</P>

<H3>Import Tariffs</H3>

<P>Regulation 3009/95 published on 30.12.95 in Official Journal L 319, amends Annex I  of Regulation 2658/87 on tariff and statistical nomenclature and on common customs tariff.  This refers to the importation of food.</P>

<H3>Illegal Banana Imports</H3>

<P>Until recently, Germany has had a derogation allowing the importation of "dollar" bananas into the European Union on the basis of long standing custom.  This derogation has now been rescinded much to the annoyance of the German importers who have apparently been defying the change in EU law, and have been importing bananas out of quota and duty free through Hamburg!  The matter was raised in the European Parliament by Fernando Fernandez Martin who asked ( Official Journal 96/C 9/50 of 15.1.96) about measures to combat fraudulent import of non-EU bananas.  </P>

<H3>Maize Residues</H3>

<P>Following the increased importation of residues from maize starch manufacture from the USA, the EU has placed restrictions on the volume.  These restrictions embodied in Regulation 2019/94  have been amended in Regulation 396/96 published on 5.3.96 in  Official Journal  L 54.</P>


<H3>TARIC</H3>

<P>The European Union system of tariffs (TARIC) is updated periodically. The most recent update appeared in the Official Journal 96/C 98/01 of 1.4.96.</P>

<P>The GATT Uruguay Round has made necessary certain changes to the trading regulations of the European Union.   The Commission has proposed (COM 96 23)  amending Regulation 519/94 on common rules for imports fom certain third countries as a result.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Food Law</H2>

<H3>Food Law</H3>

<P>Among the items on the Commission's programme for 1996 will be a proposal for a general Directive on food law to establish (in retrospect!) a framework of principles for European food legislation.   A discussion paper has been drawn up by the Commissioners of Industry, Agriculture, Internal Market, and Consumer Policy as a basis for an internal policy debate, setting out the range of options open to the Commission including both the scope of the proposed Green Paper and the regulatory approach to be adopted.  Long standing differences between the Agriculture and Industry Directorates General will have to be resolved before the Paper is tabled by the Commission for more general discussion.  Once made public it will be the basis for far-reaching consultations with all interested parties.</P>

<H3>Legislation Streamlining - SLIM</H3>

<P>The Commission has launched a new initiative called SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) published in Commission document COM 96 204 to cut down the quantity of legislation and to improve its quality. A number of test cases will be considered this year and the results assessed by the Internal Market ministers in November.  If successful, the scheme will be applied to most other areas of EU legislation.</P>

<H3>Foodstuffs</H3>

<P>A Green Paper on Foodstuffs is expected this year from the Commission. In it will be an assessment of EU action in the food sector since 1962, an analysis of the workings of the Internal Market, an identification of gaps in legislation and an overview of the international dimension.  The objective of the Paper is to elicit from Member States, consumer groups, industry and farmers their views on what type of  framework is needed for making the any changes.</P>

<H3>Vertical Directives</H3>

<P>After three years of prevarication, the Commission has finally made a Proposal to Council (COM 96 722) for a Directive to amend all 7 vertical foodstuffs Directives affecting coffee and chicory extracts, tinned milk, jam jellies and marmalade, fruit juices, sugars and honey to streamline legislation in those Directives which have become out-dated.   Existing Directives contain a number of details which have been superseded due to the adoption of horizontal Directives on labelling, hygiene, additives etc.   The proposals have been held up because of the difficulty in reaching agreement on the definition of chocolate. </P>

<HR>

<H2>Health & Safety</H2>

<H3>Legislation</H3>
<P>In the last six months, a number of legislative changes have been progressed.    Directive 95/63/EU was published on 30.12.95 in Official Journal L 335,  amending Directive 89/655/EEC on minimum safety and health requirements for equipment. A common position has been reached  (Official Journal 96/C 147/01 published on 21.5.96) on a  Directive on pressure equipment. The Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion (Official journal 96/C 39/05 published on 12.2.96) on the European Union programme on safety, hygiene and health at work.  Finally,  proposals hae been  put forward (Official Journal  96/C 23/07 published on 27.1.96) to amend Directive 89/686 on personal protective equipment.</P>


<H3>Working Conditions</H3>

<P>Commission proposals on flexible working hours and safety at work for part-time workers, employees with fixed term contracts and temporary workers are now the subject of consultation.  Employers see no need for further legislation but the Commission and the unions disagree.  All agree that  any obstacles to flexible working have to be removed as long as the basic principle of equal treatment for people engaged in flexible working is maintained.</P>

<H3>Radiation</H3>

<P>A Directive setting out basic standards for the protection of the general population and workers from the dangers of ionising radiation was adopted in the middle of May by the Council of Ministers.  It follows recommendations made by the several international authorities on the subject.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Labelling</H2>

<H3>Trade Marks</H3>

<P>Joseph Dalby, a barrister based in Brussels, has been cautioning industry on some of the pitfalls in the trade mark arena.  The new Community Trade Mark (CTM) which has recently been introduced can take precedence over national marks.  At the moment the CTM is running in parallel with national schemes.  Not all holders of national trade marks will be able to upgrade their industrial property.  The granting of a CTM, as in national applications, has to be justified.  There is a case before the Court of Justice currently concerning the right of a manufacturer to prevent the resale of his trademarked goods when they have been repackaged.  Interim opinion deems it to be lawful.</P>

<H3>Food Claims Directive</H3>

<P>After two abortive attempts to draft legislation on this subject, the Commission is looking at other ways of dealing with it.  One suggestion is through an amendment to the legislation already  in force.</P>

<H3>QUID Directive</H3>

<P>At the second reading of the proposed quantitative labelling amendment to the labelling Directive 79/112/EEC, the European Parliament adopted five amendments.  The Commission has published its formal opinion on these, in which it accepts two of them - on sales denomination and quantitative ingredient declaration for products consisting of a single ingredient, but opposes the other three stating the reasons why.  The Council would have to agree unanimously to overturn the Commission's opposition.  That is highly unlikely.</P>

<H3>Labelling Confusion</H3>

<P>European Parliament MP,Riccardo Garusci, in a question to the Commission on the Directive on labelling of prices on foods and other products (unitary pricing),   believes the multiplicity of prices on products is going to confuse consumers and add to the burden on retailers.</P>

<H3>Protected Products</H3>

<P>Regulation 2091/92  sets out the basis for those categories of foods which enjoy special protection in the European Union.  For example feta cheese can only be used to describe cheese made by a special technique in Greece from goats milk, but cheddar cheese is considered not to be regional specific.   The Comission has now made a proposal for a Decision (COM 96 38) on a non-exhaustive list of generic products under Article 3(3) of Regulation 2081/92; and a proposal for a Regulation (COM 96 48) on the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under Article 17 of Regulation 2081/92.  Recently, the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin  has been published as a regulation 1107/96 published on 21.6.96 in the Official Journal L 148.</P>


<H3>Sweeteners</H3>

<P>The Labelling Directive 94/54/EC on the compulsory indication on labels of foodstuffs of particulars other than prescribed in Directive 79/112/EEC was amended by Directive 96/21/EU published on 5.4.96 in the Official Journal L 88. The substance of the change was to ensure that the phrase with sweeteners should accompany the name under which the product is sold for all foodstuffs containing a sweeteners or sweeteners permitted by Directive 94/35/EC.  Furthermore foodstuffs containing both added sugar(s) and a sweetener or sweeteners requires the accompanying title with sugar(s) and sweetener(s).  Additionally there are mandatory warning messages when a product contains aspartame and more than 10% added polyols.</P>

<H3>Coeliac Disease</H3>

<P>In answering a European Parliamentary question by  Martin Grechler on labelling of gluten in foodstuffs for sufferers from coeliac disease (Official Journal  96/C 109/24 published on 15.4.96 ), the Commission adsvised that changes in the labelling Directive 79/112/EEC are in hand to deal with this.</P>

<H3>Genetic Modification</H3>
<P>In a European Parliamentary question (96/C 173/24 published on 17.6.96),  Martin Grechler asked if the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs should be mandatory.  He made particular reference to sugar beet genetically modified  to counter viral yellowing of the leaves.  The Commission replied that the genetic modification had no effect on the purity of the resulting sugar and so special labelling was inappropriate.</P>

<H3>Labelling of Additives</H3>
<P>Following the coming into force of the EU regulations on food labelling, there have been numerous enquiries aboout how additives should be labelled in the ingredients list of a product.  The UK MAFF have prepared  a set of criteria in conjunction with the European Commision to clarify the situation.  These can be obtained from MAFF by telephoning (44) 171 238 6463.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Nutrition</H2>

<H3>Dietary Supplements</H3>

<P>96/C 56/103 of 26.2.96 Ian White in a European Parliamentary question asked about pending legislation on dietary supplements. The Commission in answer said that a discussion paper is in preparation (by the Scientific Committee for Food ) but no legislation is planned. </P>

<H3>Diabetic Food </H3>

<P>In the PARNUTS area, there have been two proposals (Official Journal 96/C 37/07 of 8.2.96 and 96/C 41/09 of 13.2.96) to amend Directive 89/398/EEC on PARNUTS to include diabetic foods as a result of pressure from the European Paliament.   Council however, apart from Germany, seems to be against the proposal.   At the Internal Market meeting at the end of May, Germany stood out against the other member states who wanted no specific Directive on foods for diabetics.  Unanimity is required on this issue since there is a direct clash between the Commission (really the European Parliament) and the Council.  Because of this, it was suggested in discussions recently at the CIAA with Dr Crauser of DG III/E, that the Commission may have to withdraw the proposed amendment to the PARNUTS Directive 89/398/EEC on diabetic food.</P>

<H3>Infant and Baby Food</H3>

<P>Commission Directives have been adopted on infant and follow-up formulae, (96/4/EC published on 28.2.96 in Official Journal L 49), and cereal-based baby foods, (96/5/EC published on 28.2.96 in Official Journal L 49), using the Standing Committee procedure.  The first Directive, 96/4/EC amends the original Directive 91/321/EC on infant formulae and follow-on formulae, but 96/5/EC lays down uniform rules for the first time on cereal-based formulae and baby food for infants and young children. It specifies basic requirements on the addition of minerals, vitamins, etc, and ingredients they may not contain.  The criteria governing the addition of ingredients are: no risk to health, effective availability of the ingredients, perfect solubility, stability and lack of interaction.</P>

<H3>Low-calorie Food</H3>
<P>The Directive, 96/8/EU published on 6.3.96 in Official Journal  L 55,  on foods intended for use in energy restricted diets for weight reduction, means tighter control on slimming products.  The deadline for incorporation into member state law is 30 September 1997.  The daily energy from such food has to fall between 800 and 1200 kcal, with a dietary fibre between 10 and 30 g.  Minimum and maximum values are required for fats and proteins and minimum values for vitamins and minerals.  This Directive falls under the PARNUTS umbrella.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Novel Ingredients</H2>

<H3>Novel Foods</H3>
<P>Following the publication of the common position on the novel foods and novel ingredients regulation last November, the regulation has had its second reading in the European Parliament where further changes were proposed.  The Commission has published its opinion on the Parliament s  modifications to the Regulation (COM 96 229).</P>

<H3>Genetically Engineered Corn</H3>
<P>Several EU member states have decided against allowing Ciba Geigy to market its genetically engineered maize  which  is resistant to the European corn borer and more resistant to the Ciba weedkiller Basta (glufosinate ammonium.)  According to Greenpeace, the maize also contains a toxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis and another gene making it resistant to Ampicillin, an antibiotic.  Although the Commission has approved the marketing of the maize (COM 96 206: Proposal for a Council Decision to allow marketing of genetically modified maize with insecticidal properties and tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium with respect to Directive 90/220),  Austria, Denmark, Sweden  and the UK are opposed to it on the lack of conclusive evidence that it poses no threat to the environment or human health.   However it should be noted that the UK Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes has given clearance for food products processed from the maize.  Greenpeace will be lobbying the other member states against allowing it when it comes up for discussion at the June Environment Council meeting on the basis that the safety testing was flawed.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Packaging</H2>

<H3>Plastic Materials</H3>
<P>A Directive (96/11/EU published on 12.3.96 in the Official Journal L 61) amends Directive 90/128/EEC on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs by elaborating on the list of chemicals that can be used.</P>

<H3>Packaging Turmoil</H3>
<P>Two new drafts on the proposed identification system for packaging and the formats for databases have angered national experts when they were told that they would not be voluntary after all.   All packaging would have to carry an identification number if the new draft is adopted, to allow waste packaging to be sorted efficiently for recycling.  There will also be an obligation to measure the amount of packaging which is reused.</P>

<H3>Recycling</H3>
<P>The European Commision,  in response to a Parliamentary question by Anita Pollock on packaging directive for uniform recycling symbol  (96/C 173/55 published on 17.6.96 ),  advised that work is in hand.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Product Safety</H2>

<H3>Official Control of Foodstuffs</H3>
<P>In Directive 96/290/EC, published on 3.5.96 in the Official Journal L 109, the Commission recommends that member states take samples of or inspect the following sectors during 1996:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Microbiological assessment of dried and fermented ready-to-eat meat and meat products
<LI>Migration of plasticisers into foods</LI>
<LI>Temperature of chilled foods on display for sale</LI>
<LI>Benzopyrene in smoked pork products</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Safety of Food in the UK</H3>

<P>The UK Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food has published its Annual Report for 1995.  Subjects covered during that year were trends in human foodborne infectious intestinal disease and relevant animal data; microbial antibiotic resistance in relation to food safety; foodborne viral infections; and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in milk.</P>


<H3>Hydrolysed Vegetable Protein</H3>

<P>The European Union Scientific Committee for Food has recommended that levels of the most common chloropropanol, 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol which has been shown at high doses and on  prolonged dosing to cause cancers in rats, be reduced to undetectable levels.    Chloropropanols are found at very low levels in hydrolysed vegetable protein which is used in small amounts to flavour savoury products.   The UK Food Advisory Committee at its meeting in May has initiated discussion with industry to find means of further reducing the already low levels of chloroprpanols in HVP, if necessary by changing the manufacturing process.</P>


<H3>Malachite Green</H3>

<P>Trout farmers are advised to take steps to reduce the concentrations of malachite green (used to control fungal growth on mature fish) in fish reaching the market.  Although the UK Committee on Toxicology has raised no concern,  the UK Veterinary Medicines Directorate, the British Trout Association and the major retailers are cooperating to investigate the reason for the higher than expected levels of the residues.</P>

<H3>Water</H3>

Water Resource Planning
<P>The Commission has issued a Communication (COM 96 59) on EU water policy, addressing not just quality but quantity as well.  The use of water has to be coordinated across the Union to ensure there are no shortages and environmental damage.  The objective is to ensure that one member state does not move its problem into another state.  The proposed framework Directive is expected to cover the definition of quality objectives, monitoring requirements, the management of water programmes, public participation, and openness in the management of water resources.</P>

<H3>Water Quality</H3>

<P>The Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion on the proposed Directive on water quality for human consumption, (Official Journal 96/C 82/12 of 19.3.96).</P>
