<P>June 21, 1996</P>
<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  Corruption is now a prominent issue and the courts are
showing a new willingness to investigate  even privileged political figures. As
the investigation about questionable payments by IBM's local affiliate
continues, more politicians are feeling the heat.   Spain's oil conglomerate
Repsol broadened its increasing Latin American presence with acquisition of a
controlling interest in Astra. &#183;  Buenos Aires governor Duhalde is putting
pressure on an unwilling President Menem for a presidential endorsement.  Page 2
</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  Worried about the political ramifications of a stalled
economy, and not wanting to set off a consumer  boom that would vacuum in more
imports, the government has patched together an incentives program for exports.
The package, from which a derivative benefit will be new jobs, entails special
credit and insurance facilities and tax exemptions.  Landau has left the BNDES
and some observers predict privatization will now go into a sleeker mode.  Page

<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  Now that President Samper has been exonerated by a
self-protective congress, opposition and  business leaders are assessing the
limited alternatives to drive him from office. It is unclear if the US
government will put in a helping hand. In the meantime political hostilities and
looming recession dominate the environment.  Privatization of the long-distance
telecom market has been put on hold and the sale of concessions for five
airports is faltering.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  The Zedillo administration won't admit it publicly, but it
has put the contentious petrochemical  privatization on the back burner, at
least until after the 1997 elections. The postponement makes sense given
emphatic political and popular opposition. Earlier the government had ruled out
majority foreign control in the sector. Now no one knows what rules will prevail
if and when the sale takes place.  New borrowing will enable Mexico to repay
$4.7 billion to the US Treasury, whittling the 1995 bail-out debt to just $5.8
billion.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>PERU</B>  Petroperu's first foray into privatization was a success. Both
winning bids were substantial: the La  Pampilla refinery went to a consortium
led by Spain's Repsol for $180.5 million and the jungle oil fields brought
$142.2 million from Pluspetrol of Argentina and partners. &#183;  The domestic
sale of Telefonica's shares met an enthusiastic reception from small investors,
who took some $150 million.  The last stage of the $10 billion Brady debt
restructuring is in sight.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA/CONFERENCE REPORT</B>  The country's economic troubles are far
from over, but  participants at <I>Lagniappe</I>'s seventh annual Venezuela
conference took heart from the statements of two dozen top level private and
public officials who delivered a cohesive message of commitment to economic
orthodoxy and public sector reform. Participants were also attentive to the many
new investment and privatization opportunities expected to open up as the
stabilization process proceeds. Also noted was the progress already achieved in
restructuring the banking sector and modernizing the stock market.  Pages 7-8</P>
<P><B>REGIONAL MARKET REPORT</B>  What is the size and financial profile of
Latin America's consumer  markets?  A study by Strategy Research Corp. provides
a great deal of detail on where the region's collective $546 billion in 1996
purchasing power is concentrated geographically and how it is divided amongst
socioeconomic groups. Not surprisingly, cities are the el dorado for sellers of
goods and services and Brazil has the most cities to choose from. The
country-by-country analysis also gives market planners tips on how fast markets
are growing and provides data that facilities cross-country and cross-market
comparison.  Pages 9-10</P>

VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1" WIDTH="300"><H2>Government Designs Incentive Package
To Switch on Growth</H2><P></P>In the face of his party's fragile standing for
upcoming municipal elections, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has ordered
his economic team to work out a package to stimulate economic growth, largely by
boosting exports. The goal is to achieve a 6% annualized GDP growth rate by the
end of the year. This would require an immediate and significant reversal in
economic trends. GDP shrank by an estimated 2% during the first quarter,
compounded by a particularly dramatic 10.4% drop in manufacturing output. <P></P><B>Jobs
Program Too. </B>Economic incentives will also tackle the thorny issue of
unemployment, which opinion polls indicate has become a major concern with
voters. While most continue to support the president personally, disenchantment
with his administration is spreading. The cost of living is on the rise, and
voters are still demanding an explanation for the $8 billion spent to shore up
bankrupt financial institutions during a period of declining social
expenditures. This growing climate of discontent helped unify rival unions into
calling a general strike this week to protest government economic policies.<P></P><B>Push
For Exports. </B>In designing a plan for aggressive growth without making itself
vulnerable to an even larger foreign trade deficit, the government is
emphasizing exports. Brazil has lately seen some progress in managing its trade
deficit. After last year's $3.17 billion shortfall, exports through May of this
year climbed 10% to $19.09 billion, matching the rate of import growth for the
same period. But seasonally adjusted figures point to a $1.8 billion deficit by
year-end. The export incentive plan includes the following measures:<P></P><B>A
new $1 billion export credit line</B> from the National Bank for Economic and
Social Development (BNDES). The credit line will be offered to industries with
the largest export growth potential and most damaged by the real's unfavorable
exchange rate. These sectors include car parts, textiles, apparel, footwear,
furniture and semi-precious jewels. Loans will be granted for 15 months and
carry an estimated 11.5% p.a. interest rate, about a third of Brazilian bank
rates. The loans will cover up to 85% of each company's exports with a limit of
$10 million per company.<P></P><B>Creation of special insurance coverage</B>
for export credit risk, including political risk. This is an old request by
capital goods producers and building contractors that were burned in large scale
projects in Iraq and Angola. The system will be introduced by means of a
presidential emergency decree and implemented by Banco do Brasil, the BNDES and
a private operator yet to be named. It will have treasury backing to cover the
political risk coverage of the insurance. </TD><TD
VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="2" WIDTH="300"><B>Deregulation of foreign trade</B> to
reduce embarkation costs. The transport ministry claims that it is possible to
eliminate 11 of the 18 taxes charged on exports at Brazilian ports and has
already done so on an experimental basis at the port of Para. The extension of
the simplified system is being negotiated with the different port authorities
across the country.<P></P><B>Exemption from the value added tax</B> (ICMS) and
the IPI industrial products tax on exports. This is the most complicated part of
the package, requiring detailed negotiations since the ICMS is the main source
of revenue for the states. The government's tax reform bill merges the ICMS and
the IPI into a single federal tax and eliminates taxation on exports, on basic
food basket items and on materials used in agriculture. <P></P>Considering the
urgent need to boost exports and a slow-to-act congress, the government is now
considering delaying debate of the bulk of the bill until next year and
eliminating export taxes via presidential decree. Meanwhile studies by a working
group of federal and state officials concluded that eliminating the ICMS tax
would amount to a loss of about $1.3 billion a year for state coffers. States
would be fully compensated during the first three years in the form of a credit
to be used by them to pay their federal obligations. Compensation would then be
gradually phased out over six years.<P></P><H2>Privatization Troubles Hit
BNDES' Landau</H2><P></P>The battered privatization process has absorbed
another blow with the resignation of Elena Landau as privatization director at
BNDES. Last month BNDES found itself jumping from auctioneer to buyer during the
troubled sell-off of Light, which failed to attract an investor willing to
purchase the full minimum 50% stake (LL 5/24/96). The sale of the Center-East
section of the Federal Railway System nearly turned into a fiasco after the two
bidding groups joined forces to make the minimum bid, with state-owned CVRD
leading the consortium. Landau was considered by some observers as too naive to
deal with the foxes and wolves of a typical privatization. She was pushed aside
by Luis Carlos Mendonca de Barros, the new BNDES chairman who hails from the
banking sector. <P></P><B>New Model Ahead?</B> The entire privatization model
is now being informally debated as some very large properties and the power
sector make their way through the pipeline. Some observers claim that unless the
government speeds up the studies necessary to introduce clearer rules and
guarantees for tariff readjustments in public services, the privatization of the
large state companies may face the same problem that harmed the Light
privatization. One suggestion is to split the big companies into smaller units
to reduce the risks for bidders and the costs of each auction.</TD></TR>
