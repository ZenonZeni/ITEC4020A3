<I><B>This trip has had some really beautiful weather, sure beats walking
around on a hot grimy city sidewalk, or sitting in a stale-smelling
library or bumping around in a people-packed, disinfected deodorized
mall. I can easily see how people become really addicted to life
at sea.—Cindy

<B><I>It's over.  We are anchored in Boston Harbor and plan to dock
at 0900 tomorrow.  I tried to bid adieu to my friends at the party.
 We all did and somewhere between the songs and the cheers, the
hugs and the tears, we knew what we tried to say.  But what of
</I>Westward<I>?  She seems to have her own identity now.  We
polished her brass with love - or is that pride in us and not
in her?  Is polishing the brass an insult that delights the camera
but ignores the inherent strong flexiblity that wrapped around
our bunks at night and formed both our connection to and protection
from the mighty sea?—Marion

<I><B>March 5, 1990 Off Cozumel, Mexico—We got under way 
about 11:30. It was a great send off and the
sails were full and we were truckin. It was a beautiful day with
lots of wind. I napped before lecture and we jibed and struck
the Fisherman in the middle of class.—Cindy

<I><B>Adventure comes often. The sense of pride and human wholeness
with ship and sea is very prevalent. Standing with legs accepting
the hard up and down swoops of the ship, wind whipping the hair
behind the ears and the salt spray stinging my eyes, dripping
off my nose and beard, I feel confidence and peace.—Dan

<I><B>I was at the helm, pitching around incredibly, with full responsibility
of this huge ship in my hands. I thought one wouldn't get to do
this till the end of the cruise!!—Cindy

<I><B>The [end of cruise] mood is not intense like I thought it would
be, it's just strong pride in ourselves and the ship. Being back,
I realize how much I have learned.—Cindy

<I><B>I can't believe how well we eat!  This morning we had omelettes
made to order.  The selection included Cheese Sleaze, Plankton
(sprouts), Big Mac (sausage), Big Vac (veggies), etc.  They came
out so well.  Every &QUOTgalley-slave&QUOT tries to out-do the last.—Lisa

<I><B>Being on a 24-hour watch system sheds new light on the world.
I like seeing the sunrise occasionally and the sunsets are gorgeous.
The water is very blue and clear and standing watch on the bow
you can see phosphorescent critters stirred up by the bow wave.—Cindy
