<p><img src="/gifs/why.gif" align=bottom> NOAA needs better ways to <strong>map ocean surface currents in coastal zones</strong>, such as 
estuaries, fisheries, and harbors. An <strong>HF radar</strong> system that maps surface currents was conceived 
and developed in this laboratory 20 years ago. It was known as CODAR (Coastal Ocean 
Dynamics Applications Radar). By 1984, the Codar Transition Engineering Program, supported 
by the NOAA <a href="http://www.nos.noaa.gov">National Ocean Service</a>, had resulted in a commercial product. Descendents of 
that system are now on the market that have been tested in many different coastal settings. </p>
<p>Although reliable current maps can be produced under certain conditions, tests have shown that 
these radars' performance can be degraded by obstacles in their field of view and in the vicinity 
of the radar antennas. Therefore, <strong>questions </strong>remain that undermine confidence in all HF 
current-mapping radars and stand in the way of their operational acceptance. We have undertaken a 
new program to <strong>re-evaluate this technology</strong> and to establish guidelines by which confidence in 
their measurements can be assessed in practice. Specifically:<br>

<h3>How does an HF Current-Mapping Radar Work?</h3>
<p><a href="gifs/cope1.gif"><img src="gifs/cope100.gif" border=1 hspace=20 height=100 width=100 align=left></a>Two shore-based radars, spaced about 30 km apart, illuminate a common ocean surface area 
using line-of-sight and groundwave propagation. Typical frequencies used are 12 and 25 MHz. 
Each radar measures the Doppler shift of echoes from Bragg-resonant ocean waves, typically 
6-m long (see <a href="gifs/curr.gif">illustration</a>). Surface currents that transport the waves impose an extra Doppler 
shift that is proportional to the radial current component. By combining the information from two 
radars, current vectors can be mapped with nominal 1-km resolution over coastal areas of a 
thousand square kilometers or more. The current map shown here was acquired during the Coastal Ocean Probing Experiment (COPE) off the Oregon coast.</p>
