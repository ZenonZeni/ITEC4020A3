<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES C. MUNCH</h1>

<p><b>PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOLOGY , TEMPLE UNIVERSITY</b></p>

<hr>

<p>DR. MUNCH: So far as the external effects are concerned of the
fluid extract of Cannabis, the effects are hyperesthesia,
fomication, and cold extremities. These cause increase in
intensity. It is not local. <br>
<br>
So far as the gastro-intestinal tract is concerned, there is no
effect upon the taste. There is a tendency towards an increase in
thirst and appetite, and large doses will cause nausea, emesis,
vomiting, and the drugs produced diarrhea or constipation.<br>
</p>

<p>So far as the effect on the brain, I am only going into that
to this extent, to say that in connection with USPVIII which was
thirty years ago we were interested in knowing whether the
American grown plant could be used as well as that which had been
imported from India. The study made by the American Drug
Manufacturers Association and by others at that time led the USP
official Committee to the stand that either the Indian or the
American grown material would be comparable for medicinal
purposes so long as it was tested and found to have a certain
physiological effect, and from a number of bio-tests that were
made in which the material was administered to dogs, there were
three different effects produced, one <br>
effect being to cause the dog to sway from side to side, and back
and forth, and finally not to be able to stand erect at all. It
was then that satisfactory material was produced which would
produce such a response.<br>
</p>

<p>When it became necessary to prepare revised standards for
world use of the Cannabis, we standardized the standards. First,
we obtained material from various manufacturers in this country
representing the ordinary strength or potency of the product and
then many of these <br>
manufacturers told me of the material of ten or twenty or thirty
years before, and they gave me the products or materials which
were of the same commercial strength as they have always been
marketing.<br>
<br>
Then through various means, we obtained drugs and standardized
those products, that is thirteen different products of this
series of drugs. Those products were then mixed, and constituted
the USP fluid extract of Cannabis, which was officially
recognized in USP X.<br>
<br>
Then as to the method of bio-assay. Contrary to much of the
published literature we find that dogs vary as greatly in their
response as do humans. On. some 500 dogs I have used, fully
one-half were very insensitive, and were discarded immediately.
The nervous type or short-haired dog is usually a satisfactory
animal but not necessarily the best.<br>
</p>

<p>Going back to the pharmacological action, so far as the
causes, and effect on circulation, a small dose causes rapid
beating of the heart which may be followed by less than normal.
The blood pressure is usually unchanged, or there is a slight
fall.<br>
<br>
So far as the blood is concerned, there is a definite increase in
the hypoglycemiacal content. At the same time, there is a
definite increase in the blood sugar. Enormous doses have
produced death by cardiac failure, but the doses were 100 to 200
times doses, which produced a tremendous physiological effect.<br>
<br>
If smoked, there is a tendency to choking or coughing, and all
doses tend to decrease the respiratory needs. So far as the
muscles are concerned, the muscles show a definite confusion, and
with very large doses there are shown flexor spasms. But not with
a therapeutic dose.<br>
<br>
So far as the pupils of the eyes themselves, there is a very
definite contraction of the conjunctiva, and usually but not
always a dilation of the pupil.<br>
<br>
So far as the effect on the glands, there is probably a double
diuretical effect. There is a question, and the production of the
diuretic effect is unsettled.<br>
<br>
It has been reported there is a sexually stimulating effect. Some
say it does and some say it does not exist.<br>
<br>
So far as antidotes are concerned the thought is, if it has been
swallowed, the administration of an emetic, caffeine or acid
drinks in general.<br>
<br>
So far as the habituation is concerned, it has been claimed and
denied, and so far as elimination is concerned, I have not been
able to detect it in the urine. So, I do not believe the active
principle is eliminated by urine.<br>
<br>
In the general pharmacopoeia developed by O'Shaunessy in 1843,
which reached its peak ten or fifteen years later, it was
clinically recommended for all sorts of diseases and later found
worthless. <br>
<br>
There is a definite decrease in the central Indian drug which
stimulated further work done by Casparis and others, after which
it appears to have gone into innocuous desuetude until it began
to be criminally exploited, which led to the present burst of
study. <br>
<br>
Pharmacology is right I think, when it is said it does not have
the same effect, or one effect on the brain, and I may be
sticking my head out when I make a suggested answer that the
cause of the awful intoxication is largely due to the difference
in the rate of absorption, whether the material is smoked or
given by solution or in capsules and taken into the stomach, or
given rectally, and also the susceptibility on the brain, because
in many instances we have given the same material to humans or
dogs. Some of the animals it has shown no effect upon, others it
has shown an enormous effect with the same dose. So far as
animals are concerned, we have made a comparative study and find
that dogs and rabbits have proven most suitable for quantitative
assays but none can be relied on for qualitative accuracy, that
is 10 to 12%. That is a complete<br>
change from what I said in my book,1 but it is possible, by
running from 14 to 20 bio-assay, to obtain results accurate
within plus or minus 11 to 20%. But, it never has been done
commercially and can only be done in connection with research.<br>
<br>
Through what channels does the active principle find its way into
the nerve centers? I should say through the blood. So far as the
effect on the blood pressure, I have attempted to cover those
reflex changes. It has been stated and denied that there are
significant lesions in the brain of humans. Dogs I have used for
some years, in some instances showed certain types of brain
changes. Whether those are connected with Cannabis, I do not
know. I am trying to complete <br>
that now and perhaps within the next five years I can answer the
question.<br>
Regarding the other questions, I would rather refer those to Dr.
Bromberg.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Before we enter into a general
discussion, I would like to call on Dr. Loewe of Cornell
University to give us a statement on the bio-assay method.<br>
