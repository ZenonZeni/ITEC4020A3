<H3><IMG SRC=note.gif>  HIV/AIDS</h3>
<P>
<DL><Dd>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS.   AIDS stands for Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome, a disease in which the body's immune system breaks down.  Normally, the immune system fights off infections and certain other diseases. When the system fails, a person with AIDS can develop a variety of life-threatening illnesses.<P>
 
Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that by July 1994, 1,768 cases of AIDS were reported among youth between the ages of 13-19 years old.  Among the 20-24 year olds, 15,204 cases of AIDS were reported.  AIDS is now the <B>6th leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds</B>.</DL><P>

<H3><IMG SRC=note.gif>  Other STDs</H3><P>
<DL><Dd>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), once called venereal diseases, are among the most common infectious diseases in the United States today.  More than 20 STDs have now been identified, and they affect more than 13 million men and women in this country each year.  The annual comprehensive cost of STDs in the United States is estimated to be well in excess of $5 billion.

STDs affect men and women of all backgrounds and economic levels.  They are most prevalent among teenagers and young adults.  <B>Nearly two-thirds of all STDs occur in people younger than 25 years of age.</B>  The incidence of STDs is rising, in part because in the last few decades, young people have become sexually active earlier yet are marrying later.  The net result is that sexually active people today are more likely to have multiple sex partners during their lives and are potentially at risk for developing STDs.</dl>  

<H2>General Information</H2><P>
<P>
<B>Statistics</B> <P>
The Centers for Disease Control And Prevention's (CDC) Gopher Server contains national data on the number of cases of AIDS cases annually. These Statistics are found in the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.niaid.nih.gov/11/aids/csr/">CDC HIV Surveillance Reports</a> folder.  If this report is not formatted on your screen in a way that can be read, simply save the report as a text document and open it from within a word processing program (i.e., Microsoft Word).<P>

In addition, CDC also offers online access to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly  Report (MMWR).  Depending on your computers capability, the MMWR can be accessed one of two ways.  The MMWR is avalable without graphics at  <A HREF="gopher://cwis.usc.edu/11/The_Health_Sciences_Campus/Periodicals/mmwr">gopher site</A>.  The MMWR is also available with full graphics on  <A HREF="http://www.crawford.com/cdc/mmwr/mmwr.html">web page</A>.  However, the Web site requires the downloading of software as explained at the site.  The MMWR  offers access to the most recent federal reports regarding the health of the nation, including information on HIV and other STDs.<P>  
If you would like to be notified automatically when new issues of the MMWR are available, you may subscribe to an electronic mailing list.   Subscribers will receive the table of contents of each new MMWR report.  <B>To subscribe</B>, Internet users should send the message   "subscribe mmwr-toc".    Email this request to:  <B>lists@list.cdc.gov</B>.<P>

The National Medical Library  offers free access to AIDSLINE, AIDSDRUGS,  AIDSTRIALS, and DIRLINE.  The AIDSLINE contains references to literature on AIDS focusing on the biomedical, epidemiologic, health care administration, oncologic, and social and behavioral sciences. The file contains citations (with abstracts if available) to journal articles, monographs, meeting abstracts and papers, government reports, and theses from 1980 to the present.  AIDSTRIALS contains information about AIDS-related clinical trials and AIDSDRUGS provides descriptive information about each agent being tested in those clinical trials.
