<P><H2><A NAME = "juice">Fruit Juice Adulteration : New Detection Methods Announced</A></H2></P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="fruit.gif">As one of the leading centres in the world for the authentication of fruit juice and fruit products, RSSL is continually examining new methods and procedures which could be used to detect adulteration.  As part of this investigation RSSL recently invited Professor Nick Low from the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, to spend part of  his sabbatical year at its Research Centre in Reading.   To coincide with his stay, 55 guests from the food industry attended a special seminar to review new areas of interest in the detection of juice adulteration.</P>

<P>Over the last 15 years there have been ongoing problems associated with both the misrepresentation and adulteration of juices.  Dr Roger Evans, RSSL&#39;s Science Director discussed the ways in which juices are routinely adulterated by the addition of sugar, other cheaper juices, pulpwash, second extracts of fruit (particularly in the case of citrus juices) and misrepresented as being natural juice when in fact they have been derived from concentrates.  </P>

<P>Recent work by Professor Low at RSSL on oligosaccharide fingerprinting has enabled the detection of a new form of adulteration i.e. the addition of high fructose syrups derived from inulin.  The technique used by Professor Low is a highly sensitive capillary gas chromatography procedure.  </P>

<P>Dr David Hammond described the use of a phenolic marker called phlorin to detect the addition of peel extract and pulpwash and the use of HPAEC-PAD chromatography to isolate oligogalacturonide fragments from adulterated juices.  The final speaker of the day, Dr Andrew Lea, showed how phenolic marker compounds like phloridzin and arbutin could pinpoint adulteration of citrus, soft fruit juices and purées with cheaper apple and pear juices and how the use of carotenoid screening could be used to characterise particular citrus juices.</P>

<P>For a profile of Professor Nick Low see the following story in this issue of Contract.  For further information about any authenticity issues contact Dr David Hammond at RSSL or call the Customer Service Desk freefone on 0800 243482.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "low">Visiting Worker : Nicholas Low</A></H2></P>

<P>	Adulteration of foods is not a new problem.  In the early 1800s unscrupulous tea traders would treat used tea leaves with black lead to restore the colour in order to resell the leaves as &#39;fresh&#39;.  Similar situations occurred with other foods which were of poor quality or spoiled. </P>

<P>In recent years, adulteration of foods rich in carbohydrate, such as citrus and apple juices,  honey and maple syrup, has become a significant problem for the food industry.  Of particular importance to reputable food producers and processors is the undeclared addition of inexpensive sweeteners / syrups to high carbohydrate foods.  Considering that the price of frozen concentrated orange juice is around $3.08/kg solids and that of sugar syrups is $0.75/kg solids, it is easy to see the economic attraction for adulteration.  </P>

<P>Low cost sweeteners include sucrose and invert sugar and syrups with varying levels of glucose, fructose and sucrose derived from beet or cane sugar by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis.  High fructose syrups, manufactured from raw materials like Jerusalem artichoke, chicory, corn, potato, cassava or palm can also be used.   Acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch (a glucose polymer) or inulin (a fructose polymer) is sometimes involved.</P>

<P>Carbohydrates comprising two to ten monomeric units are called oligosaccharides.  These can arise by the transglycosylation action of hydrolase enzymes in the food itself, or by the use of hydrolase enzyme in sweetener / syrup production.  For instance, glucosidase is present in the honey sac of bees; amylase / glucoamylase is used in high fructose syrup production.  Oligosaccharides can also form chemically by reversion reactions from the action of acid on sucrose, fructose and glucose.   Therefore commercial conditions used to produce total invert sugar can result in the formation of oligosaccharides.  It is the differences between the natural oligosaccharide patterns or &#39;fingerprints&#39; of the pure foods and the inexpensive sweeteners/syrups which can allow detection of the fraudulent addition of such materials.</P>

<P>Oligosaccharide analysis of foods is accomplished by high performance anion exchange liquid chromatography (HPAE), capillary gas chromatography (CGC) or capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE).  Although these oligosaccharides make up only a fraction (0.1 - 0.001%) of the total carbohydrate content of foods they can be &#39;seen&#39; by pulsed amperometric / flame ionization detectors or by UV/fluorescence.</P>

<P>Nick Low was born in the UK and moved to Canada at the age of eight.  He has a Chemistry Degree from the Simon Fraser University, an MSc in Nucleic Acid Chemistry from the University of Alberta and a PhD in Food Chemistry, also from Alberta.  In 1987 he joined the Department of Applied Microbiology and Food Science of the University of Saskatchewan, and was appointed Professor of Food Chemistry in 1994. His career has encompassed a wide area of research including food authenticity, enzymatic synthesis of complex carbohydrates, chlorophyll and its relationship to edible oil stability, nutraceuticals and the instrumental analysis of foods.  In 1990, Professor Low was invited to spend nine months at the European Community Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy,  training European scientists in the use of oligosaccharide fingerprinting for fruit juice authentication and he is currently on sabbatical leave at RSSL where he has been investigating the adulteration of fruit juices with high fructose syrups derived from inulin.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "taints">Taints and Off Flavours</A></H2></P>

<P>The sources of taints and off-flavours in foodstuffs are manifold and the range and type of products affected equally varied.  During 1995, the Flavour and Trace Analysis Laboratory at RSSL investigated over 100 individual cases of taint in foods as diverse as dairy products, confectionery, snack foods, baked goods, distilled beverages and soft drinks.</P>

<P>A prominent feature of the casework during this period was the high incidence of taints in dairy products.  Many of the cases involved contamination of raw and processed milks with a disinfectant-like taint.  The taint was invariably caused by the presence of either chlorophenols or chlorocresol.  However, the source of these tainting species differed in each case.  In one example a disinfectant like taint in milk from a large dairy was found to be caused by the presence of low levels of 6-orthochlorocresol, an extremely powerful taint with a taste threshold of 0.05 ppb.  The taint was found not to originate in the dairy but was traced to milk from a specific farm and thence to a particular batch of animal feed used on the farm.</P>

<P>Another example of taint in a dairy product was a natural style yoghurt that developed an objectionable goaty / sweaty and farmyard / faecal odour.  The presence of skatole, indole and paracresol in the yoghurt was found to be responsible for the faecal / farmyard component of the taint whereas elevated levels of branched chain volatile fatty acids was responsible for the goaty / sweaty odour.  On-going microbiological activity in the yoghurt was the source of the tainting chemicals.</P>

<P>A different dairy product, cheddar cheese, was found to possess a strong petroleum / kerosene like aroma and taste.  Flavour analysis failed to identify any of the components typically found in commercial petrochemical fractions.  However, careful analysis for volatile hydrocarbons identified cis- and trans-1,3-pentadiene in the cheese. Trans-1,3-pentadiene has a bp of 42% and possesses a distinct paraffin / kerosene aroma and taste.  It was generated in the cheese via degradation of potassium sorbate.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "preservative">Preservative Efficacy Testing</A></H2></P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="packaging200.gif">If a pharmaceutical preparation or healthcare product does not itself have adequate antimicrobial activity, preservatives may be added to prevent proliferation or to limit microbiological contamination.  Unpreserved aqueous preparations and multidose containers are particularly susceptible to microbial spoilage and could present a health hazard to a patient or consumer.  In order to reduce the risk of both spoilage and microbial hazards, preservatives are added to a wide variety of preparations from nasal sprays to toothpaste.  It is important to assess the effectiveness of the preservative(s) in production batches of the preparations or products.</P>

<P>RSSL&#39;s Microbiology laboratory carries out Preservative Efficacy Testing to both the British and European Pharmacopoeia methods.  The Preservative Efficacy Test involves challenging the preparation or product with a prescribed inoculum of micro-organisms (105 to 106 per g or per ml), storing the product at a prescribed temperature, withdrawing samples at specified time intervals and counting the micro-organisms in the withdrawn samples.  The prescribed organisms include the fungus Aspergillus niger, the yeast Candida albicans and the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.  In addition, Escherichia coli is included for all oral preparations and the osmotolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii for those oral preparations containing a high concentration of sugar.</P>

<P>Some of our clients also include factory spoilage isolates in addition to the prescribed organisms.  The criteria for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity are given in the terms of log reduction in the number of micro-organisms from the original inoculum level and vary for the type of preparation under test.  The test result is given as a pass or fail.  RSSL will shortly be applying to NAMAS for an extension to its accreditation scope to include both Preservative Efficacy and Microbial Limit Tests.  This work can also be carried out according to GLP with raw data being archived with the client.  </P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "glp">Good Laboratory Practice</A></H2></P>

<P>GLP was originally introduced to ensure the quality and integrity of safety data generated in non-clinical laboratory studies in selected industry sectors.  The scope has since been extended to cover a broad range of scientific work from classical toxicology and pharmaceuticals to environmental studies and the generation of safety data for any &#39;new chemical substance&#39;.</P>

<P>RSSL has an extremely wide range of test methods accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service through NAMAS, and although some of these test methods relate directly to the Pharmaceutical / Healthcare industry, often clients require that work is carried out to GLP standards.  RSSL has extended its Quality System to incorporate the additional procedures that are specific to GLP (e.g. Study Plan, Study Director, Master Schedule).  These procedures are used most frequently by RSSL&#39;s Pharmaceutical laboratory.  However, other laboratories are also proficient in their use, thus ensuring that any work required to this standard is fully GLP compliant.</P>
