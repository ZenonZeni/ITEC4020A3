<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>Dear Carl, I am a 48-year-old single male
on disability because of Chronic Pain Syndrome &amp; Fibromyalgia
brought on by my breaking my back in two places in 1981.&nbsp; I
have since broken a total of three more vertabrea and my lower leg
in 14 places when struck from behind by an uninsured drunk driver
in August of 1994 while on my motorcycle.&nbsp; I have been
operated on 16 times to save my left foot which left my leg over
an inch shorter which agravates the broken vertabrea in my lower
back, two of which are not healed and will probably require
surgery.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I have tried every remedy the doctors could
give me to find little or no relief and unbearable side effects, memory
loss, impotence, stomach bleeding and ulcerations, and other
troubling symptoms, and I've found that marijuana gives me the
best relief from the pain and muscle spasms without the
debilitating side effects of the other drugs.&nbsp; It even
allows me to do some part time work at lawn mowing which I
couldn't do without it.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>In February 1994 the Tri-County Task Force
invaded my homw with a warrant for green stuff, white powder,
drug records, and any assets resulting from drug trade.&nbsp; I
gave them the 90 grams of pot I had and was hand-cuffed.&nbsp;
They proceeded to ransack my house and badger me all the time, refusing
me a call to a lawyer.&nbsp; I was accused of being a major meth
dealer according to their reliable informant, although after two
hours of searching my one-bedroom apartment, they could find no
trace of anything to do with powder.&nbsp; I told them, and I
have maintained since, that I use pot for medical reasons and I
don't abuse it and I don't deal it.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I was put on probation for 2 to 5 years
intensive, suspended two 5 year sentences and given $1800 in penalties
to pay to the court.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>With the pain I must endure I have not been
able to stay away from pot, I need the relief.&nbsp; It has put
me in trouble with Court Services and I am now being violated and
going back to court to hear my fate in a few weeks.&nbsp; I never
lied to my probation officer and admitted without urinalysis that
I would be dirty and tried to give him the best information I
could find on my medical conditions so he might be able to
understand what I live through every day.&nbsp; Fibromyalgia has
the same level of pain and is as disabling as Rheumatoid
Arthritis.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I have found a </tt></font><a
href="verduyn.html"><font size="4"><tt>doctor</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> who says marijuana is the best and safest thing I
can take for this problem because when you get into the pain
drugs for chronic disorders you have to face the toxicity
problem, the pain killers themselves will end up killing me.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>So in good conscience if it need be I will
do my time, but I don't and I can't feel like I'm a criminal
because I use a substance that enables me to at least function
part time.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>The drunken driver who ran me down was
given 7 days in jail and 18 months probation.&nbsp; Tell me where
the justice is?&nbsp; I don't see it.&nbsp; I will remember her
deed with every step I ever take because of the pain she left me
with.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I will battle my afflictions the best I can
as I have, but I know being locked up and deprived of the
medicine I need I know I will go down hill fast.&nbsp; I can only
hope my suffering might somehow help someone else down the road. </tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>If anyone has any advise or help feel free
to contact me.&nbsp; Help is direly needed as being laid up this
long has drained me financially and emotionally and my time is running
out.&nbsp; I leave it in God's hands now.&nbsp; Thank you. </tt></font></p>
