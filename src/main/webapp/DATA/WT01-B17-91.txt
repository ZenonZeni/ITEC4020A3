<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FDA-A New Criminal 
<BR>
Element Within Government?</CENTER></H2>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><EM>Members of Congress and the public start to question the FDA's
stridently antialternative medicine activities.</EM></CENTER></H3>
<HR>
<P>
The Life Extension Foundation has engaged an Illinois attorney
to file a class-action suit against the Food and Drug Administration,
Chicago branch, on behalf of a growing number of people who have
had &quot;unapproved&quot; drugs, ordered for personal use, illegally
detained by the FDA.
<P>
The suit is justified on the basis that the FDA's official public
policy permits individuals to import small amounts of unapproved
drugs and substances for personal use without fear of reprisal. 
Spokespeople for this initiative are criticizing FDA's policies
of protecting the pharmaceutical companies against competition
and denying lifesaving medicines as &quot;corrupt, illegal, and
immoral.&quot; In 1991, Life Extension Foundation spent $30,000
in lawyer's fees in a class-action suit against the FDA for denying
access by Alzheimer's patients to an experimental drug.
<P>
The action against the FDA's Chicago  branch is part of a larger
public outcry against FDA excesses  in general, especially with
respect to alternative medicine where it too often takes an armed
gestapo approach to regulation.
<P>
Speaker of the House, Newt Ging-rich, stirred up a firestorm when
he branded the FDA as &quot;the leading job killer in America,&quot;
referring to FDA's chronic delay in approving new medical devices
and thus jobs.
<P>
Gingrich has also described the current FDA commissioner as &quot;a
thug.&quot; His plan calls for replacing the FDA in 5 years with
an agency staffed with &quot;biomedical entrepreneurs, not career
bureaucrats.&quot; The Washington  Legal Foundation took out a
full-page ad in the 
<I>
New York Times 
</I>
this past January with a banner headline: &quot;The problem with health care in 
America is the
FDA.&quot;
<P><A NAME="BOVINE"> </A>
Elsewhere the FDA is being criticized for apparent ethics violations
in the way it handled the approval process for the controversial
bovine growth hormone. According to the Government Accounting
Office, FDA employees involved in the approval process also had
ties to Monsanto Company, the product's manufacturer.  U.S. Rep.
Bernard Sanders of Vermont said the FDA stretched its own rules
to the breaking point and &quot;allowed corporate influence to
run rampant.&quot;
<P>
In a special &quot;FDA Raid Report,&quot; 
<I>
Life Extension Magazine
</I>
makes the forceful claim that the FDA is the enforcement arm of
the medical establishment. Citing a roster of examples of illegal
and unconstitutional FDA raids, Life Extension further asserts
that the FDA continually shows a pattern of unlawful behavior.
&quot;Its role is to search out and destroy threats to the high
profits made on toxic drugs and medical equipment designed to
keep terminal patients in an extended state of pain and suffering.&quot;
<P>
<I>
Life Extension's 
</I>
assertions are finding support in Congress. In
April 1995, four prominent Congressmen wrote FDA Commissioner
Kessler a stern letter regarding his Gestapo-type approach to
enforcement. There is now &quot;widespread fear of retaliation&quot;
by FDA personnel against witnesses, FDA employees, and others
who cooperate with FDA investigations and hearings.
<P>
&quot;Not only could such retaliation be considered a crime, it
is something that has never been or will be tolerated by this
Committee,&quot; wrote the Congressmen. They will &quot;act together
vigorously to expose FDA retaliation, punishment, or intimidation,
and to take appropriate steps, including 
<I>
criminal prosecution,
</I>
against any FDA officials involved.&quot;

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>HANDS ON THE BACK MAY BE THE BEST 
<BR>
TREATMENT, Says U.S. 
<BR>
Government Study</CENTER></H3>

It was 100 years ago this September that Daniel David Palmer,
the founder of chiropractic, performed his first adjustment on
a deaf janitor in Davenport, Iowa. Harvey Lillard had been deaf
for 17 years when he came to Palmer for treatment, but he told
Palmer something very interesting. His deafness started when he
heard something &quot;pop&quot; in his back.
<P>
In chiropractic terms, one of his vertebrae had gone out of alignment.
This &quot;subluxation&quot; caused the hearing loss. When Palmer
made the appropriate adjustment, Lillard's hearing returned.
<P>
From that moment on, the new medical science of &quot;done by
hand&quot; (chiropractic) was born. Today there are 50,000 chiropractors
working in the U.S., about 11,000 students in the 18 chiropractic
colleges, and an estimated 15-20 million patients.<BR>

One in 15 Americans sees a chiropractor at least once a year and
according to a 1991 Gallup poll, 90% of patients regard their
chiropractic care as effective. About 80% find the treatment costs
reasonable, and 70% say they would surely make another chiropractic
appointment. All told, American patients are spending $2.4 billion
a year on chiropractic treatment.
<P>
Three different studies in the last 6 years revealed that chiropractic
care is considered safer and more effective for low-back pain
than most other types of physical therapy. This is highly important
because according to a new U.S. government report from the Agency
for Health Care Policy and Research, 80% of all adults suffer
from back pain sometime in their lives.
<P>
Even better, the report advocates seeing a chiropractor over prescription
painkillers, lengthy bed rest, and surgery. The studies showed
that patients are 
<I>
3 times more satisfied 
</I>
with chiropractic treatment
than are patients who see conventional doctors for low-back problems.

LISTEN TO PROZAC</CENTER></H3>

In case you've been tempted to try out the highly popular antidepressant
Prozac, made even more famous by the best-selling book, 
<I>
Listening to Prozac, 
</I>
think again. Be advised that just because the FDA approved
it, doesn't mean it's safe. In fact, mounting evidence now suggests
it is far from safe.  The FDA has received more adverse reaction
reports for Prozac than for any other product in the last 24 years.
<P>
The FDA doesn't want anyone to know (but it is public knowledge,
if you know where to look) that as of September 1993, it had received
28,623 reports of bad reactions to the drug. This is 10 times
the number reported for Halcion, another psychiatric drug that
was eventually banned in Great Britain, but not in the U.S. 
<P>
The adverse reactions to Prozac include convulsions, hallucinations,
aggression, delirium, violent hostility, and psychosis. Add to
this reports of 1885 attempted suicides and 1734  deaths (1089
by suicides) and Prozac's real story emerges. 
<P>
Evidence now suggests that certain aspects of the drug's original
clinical trials may have been fraudulent. Further, information
is now coming out that shows improper links between FDA personnel
and Eli Lilly Company, Prozac's manufacturer. This may explain
why the FDA remains opposed to taking any action against Prozac
despite the considerable negative evidence against it.
<P>
There's still more to the Prozac cover-up. Recent studies with
mice suggest that Prozac may actually accelerate cancer tumor
growth even on the standard and moderate dosages of 1-4 Prozac
pills per day.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The AMA - Looking After Medicine's Special Interests</CENTER></H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><EM>Only 23% of Americans think the AMA is a reliable
<BR>
source of health information and 70% are losing faith in
<BR>
their conventional doctors, reveals a 1993 poll.</EM></CENTER></H3>

You may not realize it, but the American Medical Association (AMA),
the nation's largest physician's trade  group, representing about
41% of American M.D.s, has its hands in every aspect of your everyday
life. Founded in 1847, 3 years after American homeopaths first
organized their association, the AMA now looms as  a monolithic
communicator of medical information-and biases. 
<P>
Each week their public relations staff sends out news releases
to 4000 medical journalists; they send video news releases to
800 TV outlets; and taped medical reports to 5000 radio stations.
 There is probably no other organization on Earth that  distributes
more words about conventional medicine to doctors and the public
than the AMA.  Ever wonder why commercial television and most
mainstream magazines are so sarcastic and skeptical about alternative
medicine? Just follow the paper trail out of the editor's office
back to the AMA.
<P>
The AMA also works hard to keep certain other words from reaching
the public. Such as denying public access to the National Practitioner
Data Bank, run by the U.S. government, that lists all M.D.s who
have committed malpractice, crimes, or ethical violations.  For
you, the citizen, this information is off limits. In addition,
to the AMA goes a fair amount of credit for blocking health care
reform in 1994.
<P>
Fortunately, the American public is waking up to the  AMA's monopolistic
control over information and medical practice. M.D.s are no longer
the &quot;Marcus Welby&quot; heroes they once were. Polls show
that the AMA's public approval rating fell from 59% in 1986 to
43% in 1993. The number of Americans who thought the AMA was a
reliable source of information on health declined from a low of
31% in 1989 to a trough of only 23% in 1993. That year polls also
showed that 70% of Americans are beginning to lose their faith
in conventional doctors.
<P>
It's highly unlikely they'll do it, given their history, but perhaps
the polls are saying it's time the AMA started looking after the
patients' interests for a change.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>MASS FLUORIDATION PROPOSED FOR CALIFORNIA-</CENTER></H2>


<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Wrong Kind of
<BR>
Trend-Setting</CENTER></H3>

Despite growing evidence of fluoride's ill effects on health from
researchers in this country and abroad, legislators in California
have introduced Assembly Bill 733 to make it mandatory to add
fluoride to all California drinking water by the year 2000. The
bill is supported, no doubt vigorously, by the Centers for Disease
Control and the American Dental Association, who have retained
a publicist to sell the idea to the California public.
<P>
Scientific studies have definitively shown that fluoride does
not produce fewer cavities in children, while evidence mounts
that the negative side-effects of regular fluoride consumption
(through drinking water) can produce any of several dozen health
problems. National Health Federation (NHF) is mounting public
opposition to this proposed bill and can advise readers how best
to proceed in blocking its passage.
<P>
This could affect more than Californians; all Americans concerned
with freedom of choice in their foods and medicines should support
NHF in this effort.

to anyone who can end the fluoride controversy by disproving any
of 15 commonly accepted claims.
