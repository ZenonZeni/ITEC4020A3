BAYER FINALIZES ACQUISITION OF MONSANTO ABS

     Executives at Pittsburgh-based Bayer Corp. were busy over
the holidays preparing for former Monsanto employees to return
to work today as Bayer Corp. employees.  Bayer has finalized
the acquisition of Monsanto's ABS business and plans to mark
the occasion with a Bayer sign unveiling and reception at the
Addyston, Ohio plant.

     The acquisition moves some 1,400 Monsanto employees
worldwide to Bayer's rolls today.

NEW TALC ANTIBLOCK CONCENTRATE FOR LDPE/LLDPE FILM

     A new talc antiblock concentrate for LDPE (low density
polyethylene) and LLDPE (linear low density polyethylene)
blown and cast film reportedly does not contain residual
silica and therefore does not need the hazardous labeling
required for products that contain diatomaceous earth.
Product 100520 from Ampacet Corp., Tarrytown, N.Y., is a 20%-
active concentrate in an LDPE carrier.  At typical use levels
of 2.5%, the product can provide 5000 ppm of active antiblock
in films exhibiting 96^ light transmission and 12.8% haze,
Ampacet says. The antiblock is also said to combine the
properties of silica with those of magnesium silicate.

NEW STACK MOLD DOUBLES OUTPUT

     A novel stack-mold concept for a wheel-type blow molding
machine permits twice the output of a dual-parison machine
while using no more clamp force than is required for a single
parison.  The original version of this stack mold from
Wilmington Machinery, Inc., Wilmington, N.C., used a
stationary center platen.  In the newest version, the center
platen moves, providing better parison positioning, according
to Wilmington president Russ LaBelle.

     Although the machine concept was first discussed at NPE
'94, Wilmington delivered its first stack-mold rotary machine
in the second quarter of 1995.  The machine has an output of
20,000 bottles/hr., the company says.

DAVIS-STANDARD INTRODUCES TWIN-SCREWS FOR PVC

     Davis-Standard Corp., Pawcatuck, Conn., will soon launch
its first parallel twin screw extruders for PVC windows,
siding, and pipe.  The screw technology was developed by
Repiquet of France, which Davis-Standard acquired last year.
An all-U.S.-made 90-mm extruder designed for 1200 lb/hr. will
be available by the end of February and a 115-mm model will be
offered later this year.  Both will have approximately 25:1
L/D  .A. 135-mm model for over 2000 lb/hr is due to come out
in 1997.  Davis-Standard previously offered 40-65 mm conical
twin-screws.

NEW LCP AVAILABLE FROM HOECHST CELANESE

     Hoechst Celanese, Summit, N.J. has commercialized a
higher performance version of its VECTRA E130 developed
specifically for molded circuit boards.  E130i offers improved
thermal stability and 50 percent regrind approval for circuit
boards.  It is suitable for use in long, thin-walled
electronic connectors that are fabricated using SMT soldering.

     Molding temperatures can also be reduced about 15C from
E130 and it has a wide processing window.  Like E130, it is UL
94 V-0 rated in sections 0.8 mm inch thick.  Properties and
characteristics of E130i are available in the PLASPEC
Materials Selection database.
