<h1 align=center><i>For Those Who Have Had Miscarriages</i></h1><hr>
<b>A primary guide for parents who have recently experienced the death of a child through miscarriage, stillbirth or other perinatal loss. </b> 	<p>			
<i><b>C. Elizabeth Carney</b>, P.O. Box 829, Great River, NY 11739</i><br>
	Fourteen years ago I gave birth to a baby girl.  Four hours later she 
died because of an internal malformation that was undetectable during my 
pregnancy.  During my short hospital stay, nurses and doctors seemed to avoid 
me and my questions.  What they did say was about the same as what my friends 
and family were saying.  "You're young.  You'll have other babies.   Try to 
forget."<p>
	I didn't want any other baby; I wanted that one!  Forget?  How could I 
forget?  Instead I was overwhelmed with crushing, breathtaking grief.  I 
remember how empty I felt the day I left the hospital...an empty womb and 
empty arms.  I never really knew her but I missed her and ached for her so 
desperately. <p>
	Soon after I returned home, everyone acted as if they had already 
forgotten her, as if they expected me to also.  Someone had removed all the 
baby items I had acquired before coming home, hoping to spare me the pain.  
Instead, it felt like a further denial of her existence.  When I tried to talk 
about her everyone became very quiet, or changed the subject, or left the 
room.  Friends were very careful not to say anything that might remind me of 
my experience.  Baby shower invitations didn't come in the mail.  Birth 
announcements didn't come in the mail.  Many stayed away because they simply 
did not know what to say.  My husband had three days to "get over it" before 
he was expected back at work.  The world kept on spinning as if nothing had 
happened.  I remember thinking that I must have lost my mind.<p>
	I thought that if my baby had lived for a while, if people had gotten 
to know and love her, maybe then I would have been given the affirmation to 
grieve the way I needed to. But I was the only one with any memory of her, the 
only one who had the chance to love her.  I had no one to share that with, not 
even my husband.  Most of his grief was for me and for the dreams we had 
shared for this child.  I felt all alone as I began my mourning.<p>
	Over the years, after much healing, I have had the opportunity to 
speak with other parents who have had experiences which were similar to mine. 
 As a result of that, and also as a result of my search for answers to all 
those unanswered questions, I have compiled a list of several "truths and 
non-truths" concerning the grieving process as it relates to perinatal 
bereavement.<p>
	This is not intended to be the absolute word on the subject, but 
rather a gauge for the unexpected emotions felt by parents who have suffered 
this type of loss.  Most of the parents I have spoken to agreed that the 
uncertainty of their grief was frightening and may have been alleviated had 
they known what  to expect.<p>
	Friends and family may also benefit from reading this over so they 
might understand the special kinds of pain and emotions involved in this type 
of loss and allow them to be expressed.<p><hr>


<h2 align=center>"THE TRUTH IS..."</h2>

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif">  <b> The truth ISN'T that you will feel "all better" in a couple of days, 
or weeks, or even months.</b>

<dl><p><dd>The truth IS that the days will be filled with an unending 
ache and the nights will feel one million sad years long for a while.  Healing 
is attained only after the slow necessary progression through the stages of 
grief and mourning.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that a new pregnancy will help you forget.

		</b>

<dl><p><dd>The truth is that, while thoughts of a new pregnancy soon may 
provide hope, a lost infant deserves to be mourned just as you would have with 
anyone you loved.  Grieving takes a lot of energy and can be both emotionally 
and physically draining.  	This could have an impact upon your health 
during another pregnancy.  While the decision to try again is a very 
individualized one, being pregnant while still actively grieving is very 
difficult. 

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that pills or alcohol will dull the pain.
     </b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that they will merely postpone the reality you must 
eventually face in order to begin healing.  However, if Your doctor feels that 
medication is necessary to help maintain your health, use it intelligently and 
according to his/her instructions.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that once this is over your life will be the same.  
		</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that your upside-down world will slowly settle 
down, hopefully leaving you a more sensitive, compassionate person, better 
prepared to handle the hard times that everyone must deal with sooner or 
later.  When you consider that you have just experienced one of the worst 
things that can happen to a family, as you heal you will become aware of how 
strong you are.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that grieving is morbid, or a sign of weakness or 
mental instability.

		</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that grieving is work that must be done.  Now is 
the appropriate time.  Allow yourself the time.  Feel it, flow with it.  Try 
not to fight it too often. It will get easier if you expect that it is 
variable,  that some days are better than others.  Be patient with yourself. 
There are no short cuts to healing.  The active grieving will be over when all 
the work is done.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that grief is all-consuming.
		</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that in the midst of the most agonizing time of 
your life, there will be laughter.  Don't feel guilty.  Laugh if you want to. 
 Just as you must allow yourself the time to grieve, you must also allow 
yourself the time to laugh.Viewing laughter as part of the healing process, 
just as overwhelming sadness  is now, will make the pain more bearable.  

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that one person can bear this alone.
	</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that while only you can make the choices necessary to 
return to the mainstream of life a healed person, others in your life are also 
grieving and are feeling very helpless.  As unfair as it may seem, the burden 
of remaining in contact with family and friends often falls on you.  They are 
afraid to "butt in," or they may be fearful of saying or doing the wrong 
thing.  This makes them feel even more helpless.  They need to be told 
honestly what they can do to help.  They don't need to be told, "I'm doing 
fine" when you're really NOT doing fine.  By allowing others to share in your 
pain and assist you with your needs,  you will be comforted and they will feel 
less helpless.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that God must be punishing you for something.
     </b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that sometimes these things just happen.  They have happened 
to many people before you, and they will happen to many people after you.  
This was not an act of any God;  it was an act of Nature.  It isn't fair to 
blame God, or yourself, or anyone else.  Try to understand that it is human 
nature to look for a place to put the blame, especially when there are so few 
answers to the question, "Why?" Sometimes there are answers.  Most times there 
are not. Believing that you are being punished will only get in the way of 
your healing.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that you will be unable to make any choices or 
decisions during this time.

		</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that while major decisions, such as moving or 
changing jobs, are better off being postponed for now, life goes on.  It will 
be difficult, but decisions dealing with the death of your baby (seeing and 
naming the baby, arranging and/or attending a religious ritual, taking care of 
the nursery items you have acquired) are all choices you can make for 
yourself. Well-meaning people will try to shelter you from the pain of this.  
However, many of us who have suffered similar 	losses agree that these first 
decisions are very important.  They help to make the loss real.  Our brains 
filter out much of the pain early on as a way to protect us.  Very soon after 
that, we find ourselves reliving the events over and over, trying to remember 
everything.  This is another way that we acknowledge the loss.  Until the loss 
is real, grieving cannot 		begin.  Being involved at this early 
time will be a painful experience, but it will help you deal with your grief 
better as you progress by providing comforting memories of having performed 
loving, caring acts for your baby.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that you will be delighted to hear that a friend or 
other loved one has just given birth to a healthy baby.
		</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that you may find it very difficult to be around 
mothers with young babies.  You may be hurt, or angry, or jealous.  You may 
wonder why you couldn't have had that joy.  You may be resentful, or refuse to 
see friends with new babies.  You may even secretly wish that the same thing 
would happen to someone else. You want someone to understand how it feels.  
You may also feel very ashamed that you could wish such things on people you 
love or care about, or think that you must be a dreadful person.  You aren't. 
 You're human, and even the most loving people can react this way when they 
are actively 			grieving.  If the situations were reversed, 
your friends would be feeling and thinking the same things you are.  Forgive 
yourself.  It's OK.  These feelings will eventually go away.

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that all marriages survive this difficult time.
       </b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that sometimes you might blame one another, resent one 
another, or dislike being with one another.  If you find this happening, get 
help. There are self-help groups available or grief counselors who can help.  
Don't ignore it or tuck it away assuming it will get better.  It won't.  
Actively grieving people cannot help one another.  It is unrealistic, like 
having two people who were blinded at the same time teach each other Braille. 
Talking it out with others may help.  It might even save your marriage.  

<p></dl><img align=top src="blue.gif"><b>The truth isn't that eventually you will accept the loss of your baby 
and forget all about this awful time. 

		</b><dl><p><dd>The truth is that acceptance is a word reserved for the 
understanding you come to when you've successfully grieved the loss of a 
parent, or a grandparent, or a beloved older relative.  When you lose a child, 
your whole future has been affected, not your past.  No one can really accept 
that.  But there is resolution in the form of healing and learning how to 
cope.  You will survive.  Many of us who have gone through this type of grief 
are afraid we might forget about our babies once we begin to heal. This won't 
happen.  You will always remember your precious baby because successful 
grieving carves a place in your heart where he or she will live forever. <p></dl>

   <h2 align=center>A Mother's Prayer/ Affirmation After Miscarriage</h2>         
                                                            
   In this time of loss I call upon my spirit within to guide me to my strength so that I may find peace and        
completion. <p>                                                
                                                            
   I will use this strength to demand of myself and others  
my need to grieve completely, for this will be my first step
to healing.          <p> During my time of grief I will seek guidance not only from  
my inner spirit but from loving persons who may offer wisdom
and comfort. <p>                         
   I need to understand that the soul as well as the        
physical body needs healing and to pay attentio to this.  I 
will learn to accept that the soul may never heal           
completely.              <p>                                   
I will learn to live not in fear and once again see      
beauty in my world and purpose in my existence.    <p>         
In spite of my new knowledge that things happen that     
cannot be controlled, I must call upon the places within me 
that tell me I do have control over much of my life and use this control to aid my healing.<p> Let me recognize the gift in my ability to conceive and  
carry life however briefly.<p>                                 
 Let me take joy in my ability to love so deeply and      
desire to nurture a soul unbeknownst to me.<p>
   Let me find healing in the belief that this oul knew my  
love for it and that that love helped it to pass to another 
place.  <p>
   Let me honor this short life not only with my love but in
finding meaning in its existence.<p>
 Let me recognize this meaning in not only my ability to  
survive, but in my fullest appreciation of all the moments  
motherhood will bring me, along with my deeper compassion   
and sisterhood to other women who've experienced loss.    <p>  
 Let a part of this soul be reflected in the spirit of my 
future children, born or adopted, so that I may know it     
through them.<p>
   I will listen to and trust the place in my deepest heart 
that tells me I will once again be reunited with this soul  
and will fulfill the need to hold it in my arms.  <p>          
 I will help myself to feel comfort in the knowledge that 
there is a star in heaven that belongs to me.   <p>
