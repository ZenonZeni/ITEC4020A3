<BR>
Kemper Funds originated in 1948, when five entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological
breakthrough called television.  They started Television Shares Management Corporation, and introduced their first
mutual fund, the Television Fund - which focused on the success and technological advances related to the television
industry.  Over the years, that fund evolved to what is now known as <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology
Fund.</A> 
<P>

In 1963, Television Shares Management Corporation was repositioned for broader appeal, taking on the new corporate
name Supervised Investors Services, Inc. ("SIS").  Through the 1960s, the company introduced three more mutual funds
-- Balanced Income Fund (now known as <A HREF="../funds/totalreturn.html">Kemper Total Return Fund</A>) which invested in both
stocks and bonds, Supervised Investors Growth Fund (now <A HREF="../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>) and Summit Fund
(now <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>).  
<P>

In 1970, Kemper Corporation acquired all the outstanding stock of SIS, and successfully combined the predominantly
fixed-income expertise of Kemper with the solid equity management of SIS.  Through the 1970s, the company diversified
its product line, adding <A HREF="../funds/preservation.html">Kemper Income and Capital Preservation Fund</A>, an
investment-grade bond fund, and <A HREF="../funds/money_market.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A>, one of the nation's first
money market funds.  
<P>


SIS became Kemper Financial Services, Inc. in 1976.  That same year, Kemper pioneered a fully managed tax-exempt
income fund, <A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A> -- the nation's first municipal bond fund. 
Kemper was also one of the first in the industry to offer government securities portfolios.  More recently, Kemper
introduced its <A HREF="../funds/retire_series.html">Retirement Fund Series</A>, which combines zero-coupon bonds and equity
securities, and <A HREF="../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth Fund</A>, which combines both value and growth stocks
in the same portfolio using the expertise of two separate and distinct investment managers.  
<P>


In January 1996, Kemper Financial Services became part of the Zurich family and, in March 1996,  took the name Zurich
Kemper Investments, Inc. ("ZKI").  As investment manager of the Kemper Funds, ZKI is one of the nation's largest asset
managers.  The Kemper Funds family is comprised of more than 70 portfolios including growth- and value-style equity
funds, international funds, U.S. government and corporate bond funds, municipal bond funds, money market funds and
closed-end funds.  Together, this adds up to over $45 billion in assets and more than 3 million shareholder accounts.
