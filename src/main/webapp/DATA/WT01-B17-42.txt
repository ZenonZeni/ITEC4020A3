<P>     Now even the &quot;huddled masses&quot; have to toe the AMA line. It began on 
May 10, 1994,
when the Ellis Island Museum opened an exhibit entitled &quot;Immigrant Health 
Traditions&quot;
in six historic dormitory rooms on the third floor of the museum. Ellis Island was
the entry point for some thirteen million immigrants to the United States between
1892 and 1924. Now the facility is run by the Statue of Liberty National Monument,
which in turn is part of the National Park Service. The island was opened as a museum
and rapidly became one of New York's most popular historic sites.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Now even the &quot;huddled masses &quot; have to toe the AMA line.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>     The Immigrant Health Traditions exhibit depicted the wide and varied range of
traditional health care practiced by immigrants of that period-everything from
leeches to litchl nuts. It featured herbal medicine, acupuncture, and folk remedies
from ethnic traditions the world over. The last room of the six-part exhibit
demonstrated how many of these old-world health practices survive today in the form
of &quot;alternative&quot; medical and therapeutic practices. On display were the covers of
recently-published books, used to convey a sense of the continued popularity of many
of these techniques. 

<P>
No claim was made that these treatments are preferable to
conventional medicine, or even that the practices depicted were valid for 
their own time and culture of
origin. &quot;The treatments presented should be viewed in an educational context and
should not be substituted for the advice and treatment of a physician or other
licensed health professionals&quot; read some of the introductory text. Certainly a
fair statement. 

<P>
Enter one Victor Herbert, a self-proclaimed &quot;quackbuster&quot; who has
been waging a high-profile campaign against alternative medicine since at least 1982.
Herbert visited the museum on June 5th and went into action: &quot;This room of quack
books is home-grown U.S. fraud&quot; says a letter written by Herbert and addressed to
the superintendent of the museum. (The letter was obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act request, and the author's name was deleted by the Park Service in the
interest of &quot;privacy.&quot;) 

<P>The&quot;quack books,&quot; according to Herbert, included books by
Avery publishing and the World Health Organization. Among them are: <I>Natural Healing 
from Head to Toe</I>, <I>Foods that Heal</I>, <I>The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies</I>,
<I>The Complete flook of Homeopathy</I>, <I>Smart Nutrients</I>, and <I>Third Opinion</I>.  This last
one earns the description, &quot;the international cancer quackery Mafia
directoryl&quot;in Herbert's letter. 

<P>Herbert's primary attack is <I>A1ternative Medicine.-
The Definitive Guide</I>, compiled by The Burton Goldberg Group and published by Future
Medicine Publishing (which also publishes this newsletter).  
According to Herbert, this book, which was sold in the
museum gift shop, is &quot;organized quackery's 1993 encyclopedia of frauds represented
as legitimate remedies.&quot; 

<P>&quot;Organized quackery?&quot; Sheesh.  There was no 
mention of the
380 medical practitioners who contributed to this extraordinary compilation of
information.  But Herbert's analysis is that, &quot;either you have a quackery mole on
your staff or you have been conned, possibly by former U.S. Congressman Guy Molinari,
now Staten Island chief executive, who used his Congressional office [one of his
aides was in the pay of organized quackery] to promote some of the most vicious
fraudulent cancer 'therapies' which ever came down the pike..&quot; 

<P>Substitute&quot;communism&quot; for &quot;quackery&quot; and we're back in 
the '50s listening to Joe McCarthy
ranting about communist spies under every barrel-naming names.

         compilation of information.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>Here's another gem from Herbert's letter: &quot;I am stunned that the National 
Park Service and the Ellis Island Foundation were conned into giving their imprimatur of 
credibility to home-grown U.S. health frauds, which rip the American people off for $25 
billion/year while maiming and killing them.&quot; With rhetoric like that, it should be 
easy to dismiss Herbert's letter as the ranting of someone who is sadly out of touch 
with trends in health care throughout the world. Unfortunately, Herbert is not alone 
in his zeal to attack our right to make our own decisions about health care.

<P>The museum received one other letter of complaint (also unearthed by the Freedom of
Information Act request, and also with the signature deleted), dated June
29th.  The writer, believed to be an associate of Herbert, admits
to having assisted the FBI in &quot;formulatingways to prosecute those involved in health
frauds.&quot; 

<P>So the popular exhibit evoked only two letters of complaint, each from a
professional &quot;quackbuster&quot; rattling his saber against imagined conspiracies.  Ann
Belkov, Superintendent of the Ellis Island National Monument, answered the original
complaint on June 30th with a letter that listed various institutions consulted
in putting the exhibit together. They were no less than Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, American University, Boston College, Howard University, Mutter Museum
College of Physicians, National Museum of Health and Medicine, New York Botanical
Garden, NewYorkAcademy of Medicine, Smithsonian Institution, United States Department
of Agriculture, and United States Public Health Service.  Are these places where
the &quot;International cancer quackery Mafia&quot; is hiding out?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Just think-in the museum of the Statue of Liberty 
our most treasured symbol of freedom, a book has been banned!</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=80%>


<P>Beikov's letter 
contained a very well-reasoned explanation of what should have been
obvious to any objective
visitor: She explained that the exhibit pre-sented the various practices in a totally 
non-judgmental way and that the final room was intended to help the
visitor trace the old-world practices to their
modern alternative counterparts. She quoted a text panel from the exhibit:
&Uacute;quot;Public interest in all aspects of personal health, including spiritual 
harmony and
mental focus as well as nutrition and exercise, has produced volumes of scientific
and popular literature.quot; 

<P>That's where the matter should have
ended. But on July 5th, Ms Belkov announced that the last room of the exhibit would
be closed and a new ending for the exhibit would be designed.  And then, on July
7th, an inter-office memo proclaimed that the museum bookstore, a privately-run
concession, would pull, <I>Alternative Medicine: the Definitive Guide</I> from the
shelves. Just think-in the museum of the Statue of Liberty, our most treasured symbol
of freedom, a book has been banned! 

<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>For a store to do this by the Statue of Liberty National Monument strains credibility 
to the breaking point</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>Despite a pending Freedom of Information Act
request, no documents have been obtained that explain the reversal of policy or the
decision to cave in to the two complaints. The bookstore acknowledges that the book
was pulled &quot;as per your request ... until we are further advised from you.&quot; So much
for the free press. 


<P>Maybe now it's time for <I>us</I> to analyze.  It's not hard to imagine
what economic and political forces could be driving repression and the banning of
information. Some external pressure must have changed the superintendents mind on the
status of the exhibit.  Even a private museum can't close a popular, running
exhibit without suffering condemna- tion, irrespective of the merits of the exhibit's
content.  Museums that shut down controversial displays make national news.  And
banning a book by any store, museum or otherwise, is enough to get the attention of
civil libertarians nationwide.  For a store to be directed to do this by The Statue
of Liberty National Monument strains credibility to the breaking point. 


<P><B><I>What is
really going on here?</I> </B>


<P>One thing is clear: someone or some groups believe that certain
        books contain things <I>we should not know</I>.  Why? Perhaps they believe that
information, if allowed to flow freely, will cost them money. The American Civil
Liberties Union of Washington State and the People for The American Way have
expressed their concern.  They are consulting with our lawyers, along with other
attorneys from a diverse group of professional civil liberties associations. 
These groups care not only about freedom of speech, but about freedom of your medical
choices as well. 


<P>Future Medicine Publishing has only just begun to investigate this
travesty. Our lawyers continue to press the Freedom of Information Act request and
are pursuing other investigative avenues as well. But regardless of the legal
implications, our real goal is to insure that information about alternative medicine
continues to be available to the people who need it most.
