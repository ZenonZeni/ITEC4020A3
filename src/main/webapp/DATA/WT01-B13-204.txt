<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_head.gif" ALT="How To Arrive At Total Return"><BR>

A recent <I>Kemper Reports</I>&#160; survey found that most shareholders responding to a recent Kemper Pulse survey evaluate the performance of their mutual fund on the basis of total return (for more survey results, see <A HREF="evaluate_perform.html">How Kemper Shareholders Evaluate Performance</A>). That's good because total return represents the net effect of everything that happened with your fund over a certain time period (see below for a complete description of total return). 
<P>

To fully understand your fund's performance, it can be helpful to review the components of total return. A fund's total return in one year cannot be used to predict its performance in the next. By considering where your fund's return came from, however, you may have a better idea of what will influence your fund's ability to perform in the future.
<P>

Let's review the components of total return for three basic fund types.
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead1.gif" ALT="Money market funds"><BR>

A money market fund's total return will be generated by income earned on its net investments, which is paid to shareholders in the form of income dividends. Short-term capital gains and unrealized appreciation, while possible, are uncommon.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image1.gif" ALT="Money market funds total return">
</CENTER><P>

Because a money market fund must continually reinvest as its existing short-term securities mature - requiring the proceeds to be reinvested at prevailing rates - the money market fund is especially sensitive to changes in rates. Its earning ability is directly dependent upon short-term interest rates, and its income distributions will fluctuate.
<P>

At the same time, however, the fund manager strives to avoid NAV fluctuation. A money market fund seeks to maintain a stable net asset value $1.00 per share (although there can be no assurance that it will).
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead2.gif" ALT="Income funds"><BR>

There are many types of income funds, and each type has its own investment strategy. But every income fund shares one objective: the generation of current income.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image2.gif" ALT="Income funds total return">
</CENTER>
<P>

These are just a few of the considerations that can affect a fund's ability to earn income:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The type of income-producing security that the fund invests in - e.g., because of the greater risk to principal, corporate bonds and mortgages (and mortgage-related securities) will generally yield more than comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries.
<LI>The length of the fund's investment - funds that are willing to take the risk of investing in securities for a longer period of time will generally be compensated (with a higher rate of return) for assuming such risk.
<LI>The quality of the investment - in order to appeal to investors, a poorer quality investment generally needs to offer a higher rate of return.
</UL>
<P>

Each of these considerations represents a risk - and that risk can be reflected in fluctuations in the price of a fund's shares.
<P>

Lower-risk income funds - specifically funds whose objective is to maintain preservation of principal - will attempt to provide relative NAV stability. As with other income funds, these funds' ability to generate income depends upon interest rates and the maturities of their securities. However, the range of NAV change - up or down - may not be as great as other funds.
<P>

High-risk income are willing to take maximum risk to maximize current income. Such a strategy, however, can erode principal. In that case, a positive total return may be the result of strong income dividends offsetting a shrinking net asset value.
<P>



<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead3.gif" ALT="Capital growth funds"><BR>

Capital growth funds, whose potential for total return is the highest among all mutual fund types over time, generally produce their total return from a combination of capital gain, income and price appreciation. Both the dividends and net asset value of your capital growth fund will fluctuate.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image3.gif" ALT="Capital growth funds total return">
</CENTER>
<P>

The level of dividend income earned from stocks owned by the portfolio will fluctuate. Income dividends vary according to many factors, including the number of dividend-paying stocks in a portfolio and the level of dividends paid.
<P>

No year is the same as the next when it comes to capital gain dividends. The strength of the stock market in 1995, for example, prompted several fund managers to take profits on many holdings, which generated significant capital gains.
<P>

It is possible for a fund to produce a solid total return without paying significant dividends. In order to do this, the value of the portfolio must appreciate.
<P>

Within the broad category of capital growth funds are funds that combine capital growth and income. Capital growth and income funds offer the added potential of earning income from fixed-income securities owned by the portfolio. By investing in bonds or other securities that produce income, this fund type helps reduce its reliance on capital growth - and its risk level. Of course, this strategy of attempting to reduce risk is not without a cost: The prospect of building total return through price appreciation is diminished for this type of fund.
