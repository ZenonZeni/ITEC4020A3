DE HIGH CT. SAYS APPRAISAL
RIGHTLY BARRED IN WRITTEN
CONSENT TIME WARNER MERGER

     If the "market out" exception would otherwise apply, the
fact that a merger is accomplished through the use of written
consents instead of a shareholder meeting is irrelevant, so an
objecting shareholder had no appraisal rights when he dissented
from the much litigated merger of Warner Communications, Inc.
into Time Warner Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court decided Dec. 18
in an issue of first impression.  Klotz v. Warner Communications,
Inc. et al., No. 222-95, (DE Sup. Ct.); see Corporate Officers &
Directors LR, June 7, 1995.

     The high court panel disagreed with the dissenting
shareholder's argument that equated merger by written approval
with short-form mergers under Section 253 of the Delaware General
Corporate Law.

     After the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of
Paramount Communications, Inc.'s challenge to the Time-Warner
deal, the merger was accomplished in a two-step process:  first,
Time purchased 100 million shares of Warner common stock to give
Time Warner, Inc. " as Time was then renamed " a 59.3% control of
Warner's outstanding shares.  Warner and Time Warner then
approved a merger agreement by written consent without a meeting
of the stockholders, who were informed that they were not
entitled to appraisal rights under the "market out" exception to
Section 262(b)(1) of the DGCL.

     Plaintiff Howard Klotz filed suit claiming that that
instruction is misleading since mergers approved by written
consent cannot fall within the market out exception.  According
to Klotz's reading of the statute, stockholders are entitled to
vote at the shareholders' meeting to act upon the agreement, or
else they get appraisal rights.  He said the procedure for
perfecting appraisal rights assumes that mergers approved by
written consent always trigger appraisal rights.

     The court agreed with defendant Warner's contention that the
entire lawsuit relies on a strained reading of Section 262 that
cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning for the statutory
language.  "Section 262(b)(1) denies appraisal rights for shares
of 'stock, which, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were traded in a public market,'" the court wrote.
"An action taken by written consent has a record date, which can
substitute for the stockholders meeting for purposes of Section
262(b)(1)."

     Section 262(b) unambiguously describes two circumstances
under which the market out exception does not apply, the court
said.  "First, Section 262 restores appraisal rights denied by
Section 262(b)(1) when stockholders receive consideration that
does not meet the requirements enumerated in Section Section
262(b)(2)(a)-(d).  Second, Section 262(b)(3) assures appraisal
rights to shares not owned by the parent corporation in all
mergers pursuant to 8 Del.C. Section 253."

     On appeal to the state Supreme Court, a panel led by Justice
Joseph Walsh agreed with the lower court's reasoning.  Justice
Walsh noted that the structure of the applicable subsection of
Section 262 places the market out exceptions in separate
paragraphs.  "Had the drafters intended to provide an additional
exception, they likely would have also included it in a separate
paragraph," but "...the exception proposed by Klotz is in the
same sentence which defines the market out."

     The panel was not persuaded by Klotz's argument equating
short-form mergers under Section 253 of the DGCL with mergers by
written approval.  "The General Assembly provided in an
additional paragraph that shareholders of a company that was
merged pursuant to Section 253 are entitled to appraisal," but
"despite other similarities between the short-form merger
procedure and merger approval by written consent, the lack of
such a paragraph granting appraisal in the latter circumstance is
a crucial difference," Justice Walsh wrote.

     Finally, no policy objectives would be served by adopting
Klotz's interpretation, the panel held.

     The plaintiff is represented by Pamela Tikellis of
Chimicles, Jacobsen & Tikellis in Wilmington, and by Daniel
Krasner and Edward Dietrich of Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman
& Herz in New York City.

     Defendants are represented by Charles Richards Jr. and
Matthew Ferretti of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington and
by Max Gitter of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New
York City.

OFFICERS OF FAILED
CA THRIFT AGREE TO PAY
$8.5 MILLION RESTITUTION

               The former owner, president and chairman of the board of a
failed California thrift and his wife, a former executive and
board member of the institution, have paid $8.5 million in
restitution and have been prohibited from working for any
federally insured banking institution, the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) announced on Dec. 18.  In the Matter of Russell
M. Jedinak and In the Matter of Rebecca Manley Jedinak, Nos. SF-
95-023 and SF-95-024 (OTS).

     Russell and Rebecca Jedinak, the former officials of failed
Guardian Savings and Loan in Huntington Beach, CA, agreed to the
restitution in consent orders with OTS and a concurrently
executed settlement agreement with the Resolution Trust Corp.
(RTC).  The couple paid the $8.5 million restitution to the RTC
as receiver for Guardian.

     OTS accused the two of multiple offenses including breach of
duty, conflict of interest, unsafe and unsound conduct that
caused substantial loss to the thrift, and violation of banking
laws and regulations.  In consenting to the orders, the Jedinaks
neither admitted nor denied the OTS charges.

     Guardian, with assets of $682 million, was placed in
conservatorship in June 1991 and subsequently into receivership
six months later.  The Jedinaks were removed from their positions
with the institution under the terms of a 1991 cease and desist
consent order.

     The OTS accused the Jedinaks of violating their fiduciary
duty by having the thrift provide them with credit at no interest
or at artificially low interest rates.  The OTS said the breach
of duty allegations extended to a number of personal trips the
Jedinaks billed the thrift for as well as the cost of maintaining
their personal property.

     In addition, the OTS said the Jedinaks did not adequately
underwrite the origination and modification of several large real
estate loans, causing a substantial loss to Guardian.  The
Jedinaks also personally benefited from several loans, the OTS
said.

     The OTS further claimed that the Jedinaks did not have
Guardian provide a reserve for certain loan losses and failed to
perform due diligence on certain asset acquisitions and
commercial loans.  The OTS also claimed that the Jedinaks had
Guardian pay an unauthorized dividend that was unsafe and unsound
and then had the thrift misreport its financial condition in its
books and records.

ONLY TRUSTEE CAN ASSERT
ALTER EGO CLAIMS AGAINST
PRINCIPALS, SAYS NC COURT

               A creditor cannot pursue alter ego claims against a debtor's
alleged controllers unless the bankruptcy trustee has abandoned
the claims, a federal judge in North Carolina held Nov. 30,
dismissing derivative charges of unfair and deceptive trade
practices against third parties who allegedly controlled a
bankrupt corporation to avoid personal liability.
Trans-Continental Meats Inc. v. Shaw Food Services Inc. et al.,
No. 5:94-CV-875-BO (ED NC).

     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theory
vests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where state
law provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,
the judge said.

     North/South Meatpackers Inc. bought products from
Trans-Continental Meats but failed to pay for them.  An
involuntary Chapter 7 petition was filed against North/South in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina.  Trans-Continental then filed a U.S. District Court
complaint against four individuals and three companies that
allegedly controlled North/South.  The defendants moved to
dismiss for lack of standing.

     Judge Terrence W. Boyle granted the defense motion and said
Trans-Continental cannot reassert its claims unless they are
abandoned by North/South's trustee.

     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theory
vests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where state
law provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,
Judge Boyle said.  In this case, the trustee has decided to
pursue the claims through an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy
court, he noted.

     In addition, he said, an identity-type alter ego action
arises from general injury to the creditors of a corporation that
lacks a separate and distinct corporate identity and operates as
a mere shell.  Nor was there an allegation that the defendants
used North/South as an instrument to defraud Trans-Continental in
particular, he said, even if North/South was undercapitalized and
controlled by the defendants to avoid liability.

     As a result, he said, Trans-Continental's claims are deemed
assets of the debtor's estate and subject to an automatic stay.

TN CT. WILL NOT REHEAR
DECISION ON AMENDMENT TO
SUIT AGAINST EX-DIRECTORS

     In a Dec. 1 ruling, the Tennessee Court of Appeals rejected
the plea of the ex-directors of a defunct insurance group to
reconsider its decision that the Tennessee Insurance
Commissioner's breach of duty charges against them should not
have been dismissed without leave to amend the complaint.  United
Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group v. Belisomo et al.,
No. 01-A-01-9595-CH-00189 (TN Ct. App.).

     The ex-directors unsuccessfully argued that the appellate
panel permitted the addition of a bad faith allegation to a cause
of action whose summary dismissal it has affirmed and added
issues and defendants after substantial discovery had been
completed.

     The action was brought by the office of the Tennessee
Commissioner of Commerce and Insurance as liquidator/receiver for
United Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group to recover
damages allegedly suffered by the company as a result of
misconduct by the defendant directors.  The original complaint
filed in June 1993 charged that each of the defendant-appellees "
John Fuhrman, Allan Gibofsky, Richard Goodman, Claude Moorman,
Stewart Reuter, Daniel Shirey, Donald O'Sullivan, Richard Tyler,
Michael Victor and Cyril Wecht " breached a fiduciary duty by
abdicating their authority to the executive committee.

     The trial court granted the appellee directors summary
judgment after finding that plaintiff's second amended complaint
did not allege a breach of duty against them.

     The appellate panel said the allegation that appellees
delegated powers to an executive committee that may have
committed acts of disloyalty does not assert disloyalty on the
part of appellees; therefore, the complaint was properly
dismissed.

     However, as to the denial of the motion to file an amended
complaint with specific charges of how the directors profited
from their actions allegedly to the detriment of the company, the
appellate court said it "takes judicial knowledge that an outside
receiver of a corporation is at a distinct disadvantage in
efforts to discover the causes of insolvency including the search
of voluminous records and extensive discovery."  The order
denying leave to file an amended complaint was vacated.

     The ex-directors sought rehearing of the panel's decision to
allow the filing of an amended complaint on grounds that the
panel's opinion (1) incorrectly states the material facts
established by the evidence; (2) is in conflict with prior
decisions and other principles of law; (3) overlooks or
misapprehends a material fact or proposition of law; and
(4) relies upon matters of fact and law upon which the parties
have not been heard and that are open to reasonable dispute.

     The proposed amended complaint that the panel allowed to be
filed contains additional allegations that were not the subject
of the court's opinion, including a charge of bad faith stemming
from the breach of duty charge, which the panel previously ruled
was properly disposed of on summary judgment, the ex-board
members contend.  The opinion could permit plaintiff to present
new allegations against new defendants and would necessitate the
reopening of discovery, appellees aver.

     The appellees also took issue with the panel's
characterization of the Insurance Commissioner as being at a
disadvantage in discovering the causes of the defunct
corporation's insolvency.

     "Indeed, the various pleadings in the record reflect that
appellant has had not only the resources of the Tennessee
Department of Commerce and Insurance, but also the legal services
of two outside law firms from the outset," the ex-directors
maintained.  "Here, whether or not 'an outside receiver of a
corporation is at a distinct disadvantage in efforts to discover
the causes of insolvency'...are not, as required for judicial
notice, facts so universally known, of such universal notoriety,
and so generally understood that they are within the common
knowledge of every person."

     The panel's ruling on rehearing made minor changes in the
Oct. 13 opinion but declined to reconsider the decision.

     Plaintiffs are represented by William Hubbard and Brenner
Van Meter of Weed, Hubbard, Berry & Douchty in Nashville.

     Defendant appellees are represented by Aubrey Harwell Jr.,
D. Anne Davis and John Beiter of Neal & Harwell in Nashville.

CT.: CO. INFO COMPILED BY
ATTY. WHO WASN'T COUNSEL
NOT PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE

     Corporate documents that were prepared by an attorney who
was not acting as the company's counsel in anticipation of
litigation are not protected by the attorney-client or work
product privileges, said Vice Chancellor Myron Steele in a
Dec. 15 ruling in Delaware Chancery Court.  Lee v. Engle,
No. 13323 (DE Ch. Ct.); Frank v. Engle, No. 13284 (DE Ch. Ct.)

     The memorandum opinion granted the discovery requests of the
shareholder derivative plaintiffs and rejected the defendant
directors' attempted use of the Illinois accountant-client
privilege, but it found no reason to compel the production of
draft versions of documents that were later filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Richard Frank and Robert Lee brought separate actions
against certain officers and directors of several corporations
related to what is now Sunstates Corp., alleging waste of
corporate assets and breach of duty.  (Frank's action also
charged failure to pay dividends and violations of disclosure
duty with regard to a proxy statement.)  The court consolidated
the suits for discovery dispute purposes.

     In deciding plaintiffs' motion to compel production of
documents withheld on the basis of privilege, the vice chancellor
said the chancery court has followed the reasoning of Garner v.
Wolfinbarger, 430 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401
U.S. 974 (1971), which implies a three-part test to decide
whether the attorney-client privilege should be invoked:  (1) the
nature and colorableness of the claim, (2) the necessity of and
alternate access to the information, and (3) the extent to which
the information is identified.

     In this case, although much of the disputed information was
generated by Sunstates' secretary and vice president " who is an
attorney " he was not the in-house counsel and was not acting as
legal counsel to Sunstates.  "Therefore, he cannot avail himself
of the protection associated with the attorney-client or the work
product privilege," the court held.  However, the court added
that even assuming that the officer acted as the company counsel,
"[p]laintiffs have shown good cause necessitating production of
certain withheld documents.  First, plaintiffs are minority
shareholders of Sunstates seeking information related to
transactions they challenge as breaches of fiduciary
responsibility."

     Second, the court said, "[t]he withheld documents may lead
to the discovery of information relevant to the transactions
plaintiffs contest as breaches of fiduciary duty.  Furthermore,
these documents may be the best evidence of the facts they
contain which otherwise would be unavailable from any other
practical source," the court wrote.  "Third, the record does not
leave me with the impression plaintiffs' request for document
production constitutes a blind 'fishing expedition.'"

     As to defendants' attempt to use the Illinois accountant-
client privilege to protect some of the documents, the court
noted that "Delaware does not recognize the accountant-client
privilege; nor do the Federal Courts....  Nevertheless,
defendants argue this court should apply Illinois law...because
Illinois is the state with the most significant relationship to
the communications in issue.  I disagree."

     Sunstates knowingly incorporated in Delaware, which
"...constitutes a knowing and voluntary request for the widely
recognized benefits and advantages flowing from the application
of Delaware general corporate law...," the court pointed out.
"Besides, Illinois' only connection with Sunstates is that
Illinois accountants originally generated or received the
documents defendants want to protect," it added.

     However, the court found no reason to compel draft versions
of disclosure documents that the company intended for public
disclosure.

               The Frank plaintiffs are represented by Kevin Gross of
Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess and Robert Goldberg of Biggs
& Battaglia, both in Wilmington.  The Lee plaintiffs are
represented by Stephen Lowey and Sherrie Brown of Lowey,
Dannenberg, Bemporad & Selinger, and by Lawrence Sucharow, Linda
Nussbaum and Barbara Hart of Goodkind, Labaton, Rudoff &
Sucharow, all in New York City.

     Sunstates is represented by Clark Furlow and Joanne Shalk of
Smith, Katzenstein & Furlow in Wilmington and by Zwerling,
Schachter & Zwerling in New York City.  The other corporate
defendants are represented by Michael Goldman, Stephen Norman and

DEMAND EXCUSED BY MAJORITY
HOLDER'S INFLUENCE ON
BOARD MEMBER, SAYS DE CT.

     A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suit
demand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware state
court judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the board
lacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder's
ability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing vote
director.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).

     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allen
rejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider trading
charges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order to
allege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show that
the swing vote director's continued employment and remuneration
hinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.

     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was the
decision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company that
develops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " to
issue interest-free loans to several of its directors and
officers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in the
company.  According to the complaint, the directors and officers
then made false statements regarding revenue growth and future
business prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold their
shares before announcing that revenues would be significantly
below projections.

     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directors
not only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000
settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securities
suits in federal court in New York City.

     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved to
dismiss it for failure to make demand on the board before
initiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excused
from making pre-suit demand because the majority of the three
board members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He said
defendant York director/president Robert Beningson was the
mastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading scheme
and that he exerted a controlling interest over board member John
Ellis through his control of his remuneration.

     The court said it need only address the first prong of the
two-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805,
814 (1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularized
facts creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could,
under the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit and
demand that would qualify for the deference of the business
judgment rule.

     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or all
directors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination or
strong influence of a party with a material financial interest in
the transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to that
of the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alone
may sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such a
situation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporation
concerning the transaction involving such dominant or influential
party."

     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Rales
v. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936 (1993), that "although the
director/officer's continued employment and remuneration did not
hinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, the
official authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in a
position to exert considerable influence over the director
officer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,
"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,
represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporate
retribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to the
financially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.

     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York's
principal client empower him in relation to the other directors,
"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to his
ability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancellor
also noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson was
greater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York's
settlement of the federal class actions without any director
contribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and John Day
of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington; and Ronald
Futterman and Michael Behn of Futterman & Howard, Chtd. in
Chicago.

     Defendants are represented by Richard Elliot Jr. and Thomas
Beck of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and Roger
Waldman and Philip Zimmerman of Moses & Singer in New York City.

6TH CIR. REINSTATES SUIT
DESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCE
OFFICER FOR DISCOVERY

     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstated
a breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedly
failed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contracting
and Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).

     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trial
court must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other
reasons to support the inference that Roots engaged in a course
of conduct to evade deposition and it must explain why lesser
sanctions were rejected.

     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liability
company, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., a
Cayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build a
government-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari government
terminated the construction contract due to Creighton's work
deficiencies and delays.

     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the Middle
District of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and an
accounting.

     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed the
Nashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chaired
Roots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At the
time, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari Interior
Ministry.

     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah was
merely a passive minority shareholder who performed no managerial
duties, received no salary and knew nothing about the company's
business operations; Roots also said its general manager, who was
deposed, had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospital
project.  However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah was
a policy maker and an operational factor in Roots.

     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued that
the Qatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leave
the country; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy and
industry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.
Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as a
discovery sanction.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiam
opinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize
dismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, director
or managing agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissal
was an abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failed
to articulate sufficient findings of fact to justify the
sanction, it said.

     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, he
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other
reasons for Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support the
inference that Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evade
deposition.  Those findings also should explain why lesser
sanctions were rejected, it said.  In addition, it said there
should be findings as to how the defendants would be prejudiced
if they cannot depose Al-Attiyah in Nashville.

HYPERION TRUST INVESTORS
URGE SECOND CIRCUIT
TO REINSTATE THEIR SUIT

     The plaintiffs in the Hyperion Securities Litigation argued
to the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 that the
district court erred in dismissing their suit over investment
losses involving the Hyperion Trusts.  In re Hyperion Securities
Litigation, No. 93 Civ. 7179 (SD NY); see Corporate Officers &
Directors Liability LR, Oct. 4, 1995.

     T111plaintiffs, Marilyn Olkey and others, labeled as
"without foundation" the district court's holding that, as a
matter of law, the interest rate bias and risks to capital posed
by the Trusts' investment strategy were adequately disclosed.
The plaintiffs said the court focused "upon fragmented and
isolated statements to reach that conclusion" and "completely
discounted as mere 'expectations' defendants' repeated
representations that they would design 'balanced' portfolios."
The court ignored the crucial fact that the defendants never made
such an effort, even though the prospectuses stated clearly that
each Trust "has designed the initial composition of the Trust
portfolio and will manage the portfolio on an ongoing basis in an
attempt to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on
the net asset value of the portfolio."

     This and similar representations of a balanced portfolio
were made through each prospectus, the plaintiffs said, but the
district court completely ignored the fact that investors
bargained for one thing but received something quite different.
The plaintiff said the court ignored its duty under McMahan & Co.
v. Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., 900 F.2d 576 (2nd Cir. 1990,
cert. denied, 1991)[see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Oct.
4, 1995, 18,274) to read the prospectus as a whole.  The court
also disregarded its obligation to construe the complaint in the
manner most favorable to the plaintiffs, they said.

     The plaintiffs contended:  "In fact, the court drew all
inferences, however strained, in defendants' favor.  The court
wound up with a conclusion that lacked any real world
sensibility:  investors knowingly invested in a low yield, high
risk investment."

     The plaintiffs further argued that the various authorities
relied on by the district court provide no support for its
decision.  "The 'bespeaks caution' doctrine mentioned by the
court is only a new label for describing what a reasonable
investor should have understood based upon the representations
made," the plaintiffs said.  Moreover, they said, the decisions
cited by the district court involve fact patterns far removed
from this one.  Here, the plaintiffs said, conservative risk-
adverse investors were told repeatedly that there would be an
attempt to balance the portfolio to attempt to neutralize the
impact on capital of movements in interest rates.  In fact, they
said, no such effort was made, and as a result, the defendants
"destroyed much of the capital that had been placed with them."

     The plaintiffs claim to have lost more than $325 million as
a result of putting their money in securities offered by three
closed-end investment companies known as the Hyperion Trusts.
The Trusts' assets consisted of zero coupon securities,
collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed
securities.  The defendants include the three Trusts; Hyperion
Capital Management (HCM), which served as investment advisor and
administrator for the Trusts; individuals who were officers and
directors of the Trusts and of Hyperion Capital; and nine
underwriters that participated in the Hyperion offerings.

     The district court ruled on July 12 that the plaintiffs have
no case because the offering materials disclosed both the Trusts'
investment strategy and the attendant risk.  The second amended
complaint was dismissed without leave to replead.

     The three defendant Trusts and four individual defendants "
Rodman L. Drake, Garth Marston, Harry E. Petersen Jr. and Leo M.
Walsh Jr. (collectively the Trust Defendants) " told the court in
a Nov. 30 appellee brief that the plaintiffs have "no facts at
all" that would warrant their "conclusory allegation" that the
Trust managers, instead of constructing and managing each
portfolio so as to minimize the impact of changes in interest
rates on the net asset value, intended to construct portfolios
that would do well when interest rates rose and do disastrously
when interest rates fell.  The lack of a factual basis to support
this contention, the Trust Defendants said, renders the
plaintiffs' pleading deficient under First Nationwide Bank v.
Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763 (2nd Cir. 1994, cert. denied,
1995).  In addition, the Trust Defendants said, the assertion is
"inherently implausible."

     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' assertion is based
on the opinion of experts who looked at the list of securities in
the initial Trust portfolios.  "What methodology these experts
used to arrive at this conclusion, and what assumptions may have
been, are matters that plaintiffs have steadfastly refused to
disclose," the Trust Defendants said.

     The Trust Defendants argued:  "The fact is that the task
plaintiffs claim their experts have performed " divining the
Trust managers' long-term investment objectives from a scan of
the first day's list of securities " is not capable of being
done.  The initial securities list could change the next day or
minute.  Indeed, the prospectuses themselves made painstakingly
clear that the managers would restructure the portfolios as often
as necessary to react to changing economic conditions."

     As for the plaintiffs' reliance on a Hyperion 1999 semi-
annual report statement that the initial portfolio was designed
"with a bias toward a rising interest rate environment," "the
fact is," the Trust Defendants said, "that the Hyperion 1999
prospectus (as well as the [Hyperion] 1997 and 2002 prospectuses)
stated the same proposition."

     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' contention that
the Trust prospectuses failed adequately to warn investors of
possible capital losses "is simply divorced from the reality of
these prospectuses, which issued such warnings again and again."

     Hyperion Capital Management and five individual defendants "
Lewis S. Ranieri, Kenneth C. Weiss, David R. Odenath Jr.,
Patricia Sloan and Alan M. Mandel (collectively the HCM
Defendants) " argued to the court in an appellee brief also filed
Nov. 30 that since the outset of this putative class action, the
plaintiffs have drafted innumerable complaints, all in search of
a viable securities law claim.  The plaintiffs' quest, the HCM
Defendants said, has been stymied by one major obstacle: the
plaintiffs cannot identify a material misrepresentation by the
defendants because the prospectus for each trust disclosed every
risk that the plaintiffs have asserted as the basis for their
claims.

     "Moreover," the HCM Defendants said, "the prospectuses
described those risks with clarity in the very circumstances that
came to pass: a substantial decrease in interest rates that
triggered a large volume of mortgage prepayments."

     The Underwriter Defendants argued in a brief, also filed
Nov. 30, that the district court properly held that the
prospectuses fully disclosed all the relevant risks of investing
in the Hyperion funds.

     The Underwriters stated:  "Plaintiffs also complain of the
selection and management of the Hyperion Funds' investment
portfolios subsequent to their initial public offerings.  As a
matter of law the Underwriter Defendants bear no responsibility
for the manner in which the Funds' post-offering portfolios were
designed and managed after the initial public offerings; whatever
continuing responsibilities there were belonged to the Funds,
their managements and advisors after they obtained the proceeds
from the initial public offerings."

     The Underwriter Defendants are Smith Barney Inc.; Prudential
Securities Inc.; Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc; Merrill Lynch & Co.;
Oppenheimer & Co Inc.; Dain Bosworth Inc.; Advest Inc.; Paine
Webber Inc.; and Crowell, Weedon & Co.

SUITOR CLAIMS TARGET BOARD
MADE FALSE STATEMENTS IN
PROXY AND 'ROADSHOW'

     Hostile suitor and proxy opponent Kidsco Inc. claims in a
suit filed Dec. 1 in federal court in Wilmington that the board
of target The Learning Co. has violated federal securities laws
by making false and misleading statements about Kidsco and its
proposal in a proxy solicitation and in "roadshow" presentations
to investors.  Kidsco Inc. et al. v. The Learning Co. et al.,
No. 95-733, (D DE).

     In July, The Learning Co. (TLC), a Delaware corporation that
produces and distributes educational personal computer software
products, agreed to merge with Broderbund Software, Inc., a
Delaware corporation that develops and distributes personal
computer software for home, school and small businesses.  Three
months later, SoftKey International, Inc. (SII), a producer of
children's educational software, launched a tender offer for TLC
through its subsidiary Kidsco Inc., and a proxy campaign to
replace the TLC board with nominees who would dismantle the
company's takeover defenses.

     The TLC board, which had signed no-shop and good-bye fee
agreements with Broderbund, declined to examine the SII offer but
secured a more favorable stock-swap exchange ratio from
Broderbund.  It told the shareholders that the synergy inherent
in a merger with Broderbund offered greater long-term value.
When SII began soliciting the backing of the minimum 10% of TLC
shareholders in order to demand a special meeting at which it
would attempt to depose the board, the TLC board amended the
company bylaws to the effect that SII's special meeting could not
be held until after the meeting at which the shareholders were to
vote on the Broderbund offer.

     Suits filed in Delaware Chancery Court by both SII and by
shareholders Ernest Hack and Irving Kas, which were consolidated,
charged that the directors breached their duty by failing to
consider the superior SII bid and asked the court to invalidate
the bylaw change.

     In the federal suit, Kidsco and SII charged that TLC
officers and directors violated federal securities laws by "false
and misleading statements denigrating SoftKey's business,
management and prospects in violation of Sections 14(a) and 14(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."

     In numerous "roadshow" presentations to investors, TLC
officials have supplied false and incomplete information on the
financial status of SII and on the prospects for a combined
SII/TLC entity, the suit claims.

     A proxy for an upcoming shareholder meeting leaves
shareholders unclear as to whether the board thinks it can vote
proxy cards sent in for a previous meeting that was canceled, the
suit asserts.

     SII is represented by Edward Welch and Andrew Turezyn of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Wilmington; by Jay
Kasner, George Zimmerman and Steven Kollney of that firm's New
York City office; and by Stephen Lamb of Law Offices of Stephen

SEC'S PA SUIT CLAIMS CABLE
DIRECTOR BOUGHT STOCK ON
INSIDE INFO ABOUT MERGER

     A federal lawsuit filed Dec. 6 in Philadelphia by the
Securities and Exchange Commission charges cable television
magnate Harold Lenfest with insider trading in connection with
the attempted merger of his company's parent corporation and Bell
Atlantic Corp.  Securities & Exchange Commission v. Lenfest and
Lenfest, No. 95-7597 (ED PA).

     The suit alleges that, as a director of Liberty Media Corp.,
Lenfest was warned against trading on or disclosing the
information that Liberty " which had recently been reacquired by
ex-parent Tele-Communications Inc. " would be part of a merger
with Bell Atlantic in 1993.  Nevertheless, he revealed the
information to his wife, Marguerite, who was also an officer of
Liberty, and she instructed her son Chase to buy stock in either
TCI or Liberty.

     Two days after Chase bought large blocks of TCI stock for
his mother and himself, Bell Atlantic announced the merger plan,
and TCI stock skyrocketed, the SEC claims.  On paper, the
Lenfests earned a profit of $120,750 on 35,000 shares.

     The SEC charges that both Harold and his wife violated both
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and their
fiduciary duty as officers of Liberty.  The suit also asks the
court to order the two to disgorge their profits and to pay civil
penalties.

     The SEC is represented by Thomas Newkirk, Associate Director
in Washington, DC, and Senior Trial Counsel Richard Levan in
Philadelphia.

     The Lenfests are represented by Richard Morvillo of Crowell
& Moring in Washington, DC.

DEFENDANTS IN MI CASE
SEEK PROTECTIVE ORDER,
NOTE DISAGREEMENTS

     The defendants in the Mutual Savings Bank Securities
Litigation moved the federal court in Detroit on Nov. 13 for a
protective order covering what they describe as "a small portion"
of the more than 25,000 pages of documents the defendants have
produced in response to the plaintiffs' requests.  In re Mutual
Savings Bank Securities Litigation, No. 95-CV-71590-DT (Judge
John Feikens) (ED MI, Southern Div.).

     The defendants " Mutual Savings Bank and co-defendants "
said the parties have worked on drafting a proposed protective
order but have run into two areas of disagreement.

     The first area, the defendants said, involves their request
that in addition to informing a nonparty (including an expert
witness) of the existence and nature of the protective order, any
such person to whom confidential documents are shown should be
required to sign a written undertaking to abide by the order.
The defendants said this will eliminate any later dispute
regarding whether a person was or was not informed of the
provisions of the order, and the act of signing an
acknowledgement should serve to reinforce the obligations imposed
by the order.

     The defendants said there is no reason for the plaintiffs'
opposition to the signed acknowledgement because the order
proposed by the defendants would not require the plaintiffs to
submit all the signed acknowledgements to defendants, i.e., the
plaintiffs would not be required to disclose the identity of
persons, such as potential expert witnesses, to whom they
provided any confidential material unless an issue arose
regarding misuse of the information.  The defendants said:  "The
requirement of the signed acknowledgement is a reasonable
prophylactic measure which imposes no material burden.  It should
be embodied in the protective order."

     The defendants said the second area of disagreement relates
to the protection that will be given information included in
confidential documents when that information is recounted in or
attached to a document filed with the court.  The defendants said
they recognize that there is a distinction between the
protections afforded to the fruits of discovery and to materials
filed with the court.  "Yet if plaintiffs can unilaterally file
confidential material in the public court file," the defendants
said, "any protection to which the information may be entitled
would be mooted."  The defendants said they request that the
plaintiffs provide reasonable advance notice of an intention to
file such material, thereby giving the defendants the chance to
seek relief from the court.  "If the requirement of advance
notice is burdensome," the defendants said, "an alternative would
be to permit the material to be filed under seal subject to the
producing party filing, within a specified short date, a motion
to retain the material under seal."

     In a Dec. 4 brief opposing the motion, the plaintiffs said
the requirements proposed by the defendants would impose
"unnecessary and undue burdens" on the plaintiffs in a situation
where the defendants have not even attempted to meet their
initial burden of establishing that such documents should be
treated as confidential.

     The defendants, the plaintiffs said, seek a provision that
would require all class members and non-parties (including
consultants and expert witnesses) to execute signed
acknowledgments that they have received the proposed protective
order, prior to reviewing any documents that the defendants may
have unilaterally designated as "confidential."

     "Contrary to Defendants' assertion that this requirement is
a reasonably prophylactic measure which imposes no material
burden on Plaintiffs," the court was told, "this provision
effectively 'chills' Plaintiffs' ability to pursue and obtain
relevant discovery by (i) potentially subjecting every person
shown a 'confidential' document to the jurisdiction of this court
through, vis-a-vis, their signed acknowledgement, and
(ii) imposing an additional burden on Plaintiffs to obtain,
maintain and produce, if required, all such acknowledgements."

     Similarly, the plaintiffs contended, they object to the
proposed provision that would require a party intending to file a
document unilaterally designed by defendants as "confidential" to
give four business days notice to the opposing party of intent to
file, and file such document under seal.  The plaintiffs said
case authority shows that a protective order that so restricts
public disclosure, prior to a court finding that the information
sought warrants protection, is a prior restraint on the First
Amendment right of expression.

     (Copies of the plaintiffs' opposition brief and the
defendants' motion for a protective order are available from
Andrew Document Access Service.)

     On Oct. 20, the parties stipulated that Count IV of the
complaint, alleging negligent misrepresentation, should be
dismissed without prejudice.

     The litigation was initiated by three shareholders in Mutual
Savings Bank, who allege that the bank and its co-defendants
concealed the risky nature of Mutual's investments, particularly
the interest rate-sensitive nature of investments in mortgage-
backed derivatives.  The plaintiffs claim the defendants also
misrepresented the success of the bank's new loan origination and
loan service business and that the defendants artificially
inflated the market price of the stock during the purported class
period " Nov. 30, 1993, through Nov. 14, 1994.  In addition, the
plaintiffs allege that certain of the defendant directors reaped
substantial profits from their sale of bank stock, based on their
private confidential negative information, not available to
members of the investing public.

     The defendants are represented by Allan Horwich, Eugene J.
Geekie Jr. and Adam C. Smedstad of Schiff Hardin & Waite in
Chicago.  Of counsel is the firm of Howard & Howard in Bloomfield
Hills, MI.  The plaintiffs are represented by Elwood S. Simon and

PA CLAIM AGAINST QUAD HAS
MORE SUBSTANCE THAN U.S.
HEALTHCARE SUIT, CT. TOLD

     Citing a ruling by the same court in J/H Real Estate Inc. v.
Abramson, plaintiffs in a class action alleging securities
manipulation and fraud by Quad Systems Corp. and three of its
officers on Dec. 27 told the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
that their claims are more specific than those the court refused
to dismiss in the suit against officers of U.S. Healthcare.
Pozzi v. Smith, No. 95-1454 (ED PA); see Corporate Officers &
Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995.

     Plaintiff Diane D. Pozzi purchased 1,000 shares of Quad in
February 1992 at $13.25 a share.  By March 8, the stock price had
fallen to $7.25, triggering the instant suit.  Quad,
headquartered in Warminster, PA, manufactures surface-mount
assembly equipment used to make printed circuit boards.  In
addition to the company, the complaint names Quad president and
CEO David Smith; David Young, a founder and member of the board;
and Anthony Drury, senior vice president and CFO.

     The complaint asserts that Quad officers misrepresented
company revenues and shielded the public from the fact that a new
product had developed problems and had not brought in expected
revenues.  Although company officials wrote a letter Jan. 30,
1995, notifying shareholders that the company was experiencing
"some software issues with regard to ease of use" of a main
product, it was not distributed until a later date, Pozzi
charged.

     In support of their original motion to dismiss, defendants
argued that the "bespeaks caution" doctrine adopted by the Third
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals compels dismissal because the
uncertainties of software development were adequately disclosed
by the company.  However, in his Dec. 1 opinion, the judge noted
that "even though Quad made certain cautionary statements about
software limitations and bugs (which it soft-pedalled by
describing them as not unusual), it was simultaneously hiding the
effect of those problems on the company's business."

     Defendants moved to reargue the decision, but plaintiffs
countered that the complaint in J/H Real Estate Inc. v. Abramson
et al. (see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995,
P. 18,687), in which a class has been certified and allegations
of negligent misrepresentation have survived motions to dismiss,
lacks the specificity contained in the charges against Quad, its
president, one of the company's founders and its chief financial
officer.

     Pozzi's allegations contain more detail than the complaint
sustained in Abramson, plaintiffs assert. The need for
individualized proof of reliance should not direct trial courts
toward denying class certification, plaintiffs argued, adding
several citations.  Defendants' efforts to induce the court to go
outside the pleading to analyze plaintiff's reliance is
inappropriate in the context of a motion to dismiss and factually
inaccurate, plaintiffs stated.

     On Jan. 31, 1995, plaintiffs stated, defendants conducted an
analysts' conference and misinformed them regarding any
significant functional problems with the company's software.  At
least one stockbroker reiterated its recommendation to buy Quad
stock based on that conference call, plaintiffs argued.  Pozzi's
testimony demonstrates that she relied on defendants' statements
made to the broker, plaintiffs argued.

     Defendants are represented by R. Nicholas Gimbel of the
Philadelphia firm of Klett Lieber Rooney & Schorling.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Dennis J. Johnson of
Havertown, PA, and by Barbara Podell of the Philadelphia firm of
Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan.

RI BREACH OF DUTY CLAIM
AGAINST GENERAL PARTNERS
FAILS; DISCLOSURE ADEQUATE

     Finding that defendant general partners made all the
necessary disclosures to the limited partners, a state court
judge in Providence, RI, has rejected conversion and breach of
fiduciary duty claims by several limited partners against two
general partners who negotiated a sale of the partnership's only
asset.  Epstein et al. v. Dimeo et al., No. 94-2368 (RI Super.
Ct., Providence Cty.).

     In 1978, the plaintiffs bought a limited partnership unit in
a partnership that built, maintained and managed a housing
development.  In 1991, the general partners notified the limited
partners of a purchase offer.  Under the offer, the partnership
would receive payment partly in cash and partly in a 15-year
unsecured nonrecourse note; in addition, the general partners
would separately sell their management rights.

     It took two years, repeated solicitations to the limited
partners and modification of the offer before the general
partners obtained the consent of the required two-thirds of the
15 partnership units.

     The plaintiffs filed a Superior Court complaint alleging
breach of the partnership agreement, violation of the Rhode
Island Limited Partnership Act, breach of fiduciary duty,
conversion and unjust enrichment.

     A defense motion for summary judgment was granted.  First,
the court found no provision in the agreement or statute that
prohibited the general partners from accumulating the required
consents through repeated solicitations.

     Next, it found no breach of fiduciary duty because the
general partners fully disclosed all material facts regarding the
transaction.  The letters sent to the limited partners clearly
indicated how the proceeds of the sale were to be allocated.

     Third, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that
unanimous consent of the partnership units was required before
the nonrecourse note could be distributed.  Acceptance of the
nonrecourse note did not increase the limited partners' personal
liability, so unanimous approval was not necessary, the court
said.

MO COURT: PARTNERS CAN BE
SUED FOR INTERFERING WITH
BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS

     Two partners who made false financial-related statements
about their other partners and their corporation to banks can be
sued for intentional interference with the corporation's business
expectations, the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  21
West Inc. et al. v. Meadowgreen Trails Inc. et al., No. 65978
(MO Ct. App.).

     In a unanimous decision, the panel said the defendants used
improper tactics to safeguard their own economic interests.

     The complex litigation involved Joe and Carol Layton, their
ex-partners John and Ann Gorse and several interlocking
corporations involved in land development and home construction.
Relations between the Laytons and the Gorses deteriorated,
including a dispute over who would be officers of Meadowgreen
Trails Inc., a development company of which each couple owned
50%; the Gorses prevailed.

     The Laytons and their corporation, 21 West, filed a petition
in equity to liquidate Meadowgreen and filed a notice of lis
pendens as to property owned by the company.  There also were
claims against the Gorses individually.

     The Laytons wrote to all financial institutions and banks in
the St. Louis phone book, objecting to any loans made to
Meadowgreen or to the Gorses on behalf of Meadowgreen.  At least
two banks had prior dealings with the company, and one bank cited
the Laytons' letter in denying a $475,000 loan to Meadowgreen.

     The Laytons and 21 West filed a petition in St. Louis County
Circuit Court alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of corporate funds,
intentional interference with business expectancies, liquidation
and other causes of action.  Meadowgreen and the Gorses
counterclaimed, alleging tortious interference and other causes
of action.

     After a bench trial, Judge Herbert Lasky awarded the Laytons
$1.582 million for their share of Meadowgreen.  At the same time,
he offset that award in full for what he assessed the Laytons as
owing Meadowgreen and the Gorses for intentional interference,
breach of fiduciary duty and trespass.  He also ordered the
Laytons to convey their interest in Meadowgreen to the
corporation.  Cross-appeals were filed.

     The Court of Appeals, Eastern District, modified slightly in
an opinion by Judge Gary Gaertner.

     The panel upheld the offset, saying the trial judge could
disregard the corporate entity where justice requires.  The
Laytons controlled and were sole shareholders, directors and
officers of one of the corporations that committed misconduct, it
said.  In addition, it cited an exception to the general
requirement for mutuality of parties in setoffs where there is no
prejudice and where a setoff discharges a judgment against a
nonmutual party.

     Next, it upheld the Laytons' liability for tortious
interference, finding sufficient evidence that their letters to
the banks contained factual misrepresentations about Meadowgreen
and that the Laytons used improper means to protect their
interest in Meadowgreen.  There also was enough evidence of
Meadowgreen's valid business expectancy, which the Laytons knew
about, and of damages, it held.

     The trial judge's decision was modified to make parts of the
award in favor of Meadowgreen rather than in favor of the Gorses
individually.

     On other issues, the court upheld the Laytons' liability for
breach of contract in connection with the sale of lots,
prejudgment interest and unjust enrichment.  The Laytons'
challenge to the award of contempt damages was dismissed because
there was no attempt to execute on that order.

     Counsel were Michael F. Roche and Thomas Cummings of St.
Louis for the Laytons and John L. Gianoulakis and Lori J. Baskins
of St. Louis for Meadowgreen.

NC JUDGE SAYS STATE COURT
SHOULD DECIDE DIRECTOR
LIABILITY FOR DEFAMATION

     A federal judge in North Carolina on Nov. 29 ruled that a
state court should hear a defamation and emotional distress suit
against Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc., Rev. Pat
Robertson, the executive director of Christian Coalition and
corporate directors of CBN.  Peterson et al. v. Robertson et al.,
No. 6:95CV00450 (MD NC).

     The judge rejected a defense argument that one officer had
been fraudulently joined in an effort to avoid complete
diversity.

     Mark Peterson was hired as a supervisor in a CBN subsidiary
that sold discount coupon books, long-distance phone service,
vacation rentals and other consumer services.  He was promoted in
November 1991 by Robertson to president of the subsidiary,
American Benefits Plus, but was fired in December 1992 when the
directors became concerned about finances and customer
complaints.

     Critical comments about Peterson were made in an August 1993
press release from Robertson, in a September 1994 "Prime Time
Live" interview with Ralph Reed, executive director of
Robertson's Christian Coalition, and in a September 1994 letter
from CBN to "Prime Time Live"; the comments referred to
Peterson's business operations and alleged theft of donor lists
and documents for personal profit.

     A complaint was filed in state court against CBN, Reed, the
directors and Robertson, alleging defamation, emotional distress
and loss of consortium.  The defense removed the case to the
Middle District of North Carolina, asserting that director Paul
A. Holcombe Jr. was a North Carolina resident who had been
fraudulently joined as a defendant to defeat diversity.

     Judge James A. Beaty Jr. granted Peterson's motion to remand
to state court, finding a lack of complete diversity.  Holcombe
was not fraudulently joined, and it is possible for Peterson to
prevail against him on the merits in state court, the judge held.
Holcombe belonged to the board from September 1993 to March 1995
and can be held liable for corporate acts or breach of his
statutory duty during that period.

     The complaint adequately pled facts in support of Peterson's
defamation claim against Holcombe based on statements by Reed and
the letter from Robertson and CBN to "Prime Time Live," allegedly
authorized and ratified during Holcombe's tenure on the board,
Judge Beaty said.

     As for defense arguments that Holcombe is immune from suit
under Virginia law as a director of a tax-exempt corporation, the
judge found a material factual issue as to whether Holcombe was
compensated for his services and whether CBN is tax-exempt.

BANK OWNER WAS NOT
'UNJUSTLY ENRICHED,'
SUP. CT. RESPONDENT SAYS

     Robert D. Rapaport, a majority shareholder in Great Life
Savings Association, should not be liable under 12 U.S.C. Section
1818(b)(6)(A) for failing to honor the bank's net worth agreement
because the government produced no evidence that he was "unjustly
enriched" in the process, Rapaport argued in a Dec. 11 brief
opposing a U.S. Supreme Court certiorari petition filed last
month by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  U.S. Dept. of
the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision v. Rapaport, No. 95-
738 (U.S.) see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Nov. 16, 1994.

     Rapaport had personally guaranteed Great Life's net worth by
signing a net worth maintenance agreement with OTS.  However, he
refused to pay the agreed-upon monies when the bank's funds
dropped below minimum federal levels.

     "[Section] 1818(b)(6)(A) requires evidence of unjust
enrichment " a personal benefit, something more than a failure to
make a monetary payment under contracts " as a prerequisite to
the recovery of money in an administrative proceeding," Rapaport
argued.

     In 1984, Great Life was seeking federal depositors
insurance.  The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which was later
succeeded by OTS, approved Great Life's application for insurance
with one caveat " Rapaport, who owned 70% of the bank's stock,
was required to guarantee the bank's net worth.

     The bank's net worth, however, dipped below minimum federal
levels and in 1989 the OTS notified Rapaport that he was
obligated to shore up the bank's weak financial condition.
Rapaport failed to make the requested payments and the following
year OTS filed an administrative proceeding to collect the money.

     In 1993, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Rapaport
liable for violating the agreement.  The OTS acting director
affirmed the ALJ's decision, finding that Rapaport's failure to
honor the agreement had unjustly enriched him under Section
1818(b)(6)(A).  The acting director said that Rapaport had been
unjustly enriched by retaining the money he had promised to pay.

     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in
reversing the OTS decision, said that a definition of "unjust
enrichment" was limited to personal benefit under common law
torts.  Under this reading, the D.C. Circuit found that
Rapaport's failure to pay did not evidence that he had gained
personally.  The OTS filed for certiorari.

     "OTS cannot show unjust enrichment in this case, because
Respondent reaped no personal benefit," Rapaport's opposition
brief argues.  "If OTS has a remedy against Respondent, that
remedy lies in an Article III court, not in an administrative
forum.  To hold otherwise would be to give OTS an unfettered
power to engage in administrative enforcement, and that is a
power Congress never intended it to have."

     Rapaport is represented by Frank J. Eisenhart, Arthur W.
Leibold Jr., Julia J. Tyler and Neil R. Crowley of Dechert, Price
& Rhoads, Washington, DC.  The OTS is represented by Carolyn J.
Buck, Thomas J. Segal and Aaron B. Kahn, Washington, DC.

OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASD
EXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASE
INVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM

     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned a
securities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in a
Nov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
that the National Association of Securities Dealers stretched
beyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involving
a misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securities
and Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).

     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceeds
the power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks to
impose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investment
banking or securities business for his alleged failure to act in
his corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"
according to the brief.

     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-
based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument on
allegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporations
law by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-
chartered, non-NASD member private business.

     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reserved
under the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued.
"Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law and
the relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to state
law....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs of
private corporations and federal law shall not intrude into those
internal affairs."

     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for
$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrine
corporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-
owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.
(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check for
the full amount to the AIFC customer.

     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld payment
for two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation was
unsupported.

     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of a
disciplinary action against Alderman by the District Business
Conduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being an
officer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vice
president.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC found
Alderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.

    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of his
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade."

               According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and fined
him $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD's
National Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed the
DBCC.

     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladder
when Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealed
to the Ninth Circuit.

      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.
2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law " not
the NASD " governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.
Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371
allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of the
company.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bank
accounts fell to a vice president for finance and not to
Alderman, the brief argued.

      "The standards to which directors are held are established
by state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent and
prudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearly
recognized that the Board's responsibility is limited to
overseeing the operation."

     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.
The SEC is represented by Randall W. Quinn, Senior Litigation
Counsel for the SEC in Washington, DC.

FINES TOTALING $258,000
LEVIED BY NASD AGAINST
WORTHEN RESPONDENTS

     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000
against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several of
its officers and registered representatives in connection with
the sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,
derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and Related
Cases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).

     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit against
Worthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted as
safe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fund
sales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthen
banks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year along
with Worthen Investments.

     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQ
Stock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.

     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individual
respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations against
them, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by the
Association's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.

     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that they
made, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to their
customers about the characteristics and safety features of the
mutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition to
conducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,
Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligence
in connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fund
products."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies of
all customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system.

     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  In
addition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additional
sanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of all
internal policies and an agreement to form an investment
committee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthen
personnel to market all securities.  The committee is to
especially consider the suitability of sales literature to
promote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results of
the independent audit and investment committee reviews are
subject to NASD inspection.

     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,
Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen's
executive vice president and former compliance officer.

     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-year
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in all
capacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he bore
responsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to public
customers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,
NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sent
misleading sales correspondence to public customers that
misstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fund
investments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who use
such correspondence, NASD said.

     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-day
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as a
principal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findings
that he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondence
that misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  In
addition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies of
customer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm's
files and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.

     Higher fines were levied against the seven representatives
who were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highest
amount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,
and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, the
seven representatives were fined $130,900.

     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., which
was the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.

     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with the
investigation "and promptly instituted new policies and
procedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent future
violations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banks
but did not change the name of the investment company after
acquiring the Worthen enterprises.)

CONGRESS OVERRIDES VETO
OF RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES
LITIGATION LEGISLATION

     By a convincing margin, Congress overrode President Bill
Clinton's Dec. 19 veto of legislation restricting shareholders'
lawsuits alleging securities fraud " a bill generally condemned
by trial lawyers and praised by publicly held companies.  "The
Securities Litigation Reform Act," H.R. 1058.  (See Corporate
Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995).

     H.R. 1058, The Securities Litigation Reform Act, makes
numerous changes that proponents say will cut down on frivolous
lawsuits.  For example, safe harbors for forward-looking
statements are strengthened, while damage awards for plaintiff
investors are tightened.

     Opponents of the Act, including trial lawyers, regulators
and consumer groups, say the legislation gives companies too much
"wiggle" room while, at the same time, increases risks for small
investors.  Under the Act, for example, companies are less liable
for their forward-looking statements and are under no duty to
make continuing projections.  These kinds of changes, however,
have generally been applauded by high-technology companies.

     The high-tech industry has complained that it is especially
hard hit by frivolous lawsuits because of the unavoidable
volatility of their stock prices.

     An entire section of the Act is reserved for "prevention of
abusive practices that forwent litigation."  The section includes
the elimination of bonus payments to named plaintiffs in class
actions, restrictions on professional plaintiffs, disclosure of
settlement terms to class members, and a prohibition against the
payment of referral fees by attorneys to brokers, dealers or
associated persons.

     The Act also contains a break for accountants, who are often
named as co-defendants, by providing steps to follow for
disclosing wrongdoing and by limiting their liability in fraud
cases.  The Act states, "No independent public accountant shall
be liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, or
statement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3)
[Notice To Commission; Response to Failure to Notify] or (4)
[Report After Resignation]."
