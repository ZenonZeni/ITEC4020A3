This list provides a guide to some important and useful references on various aspects of the topic.  It is not intended to be comprehensive, only an introduction to some of the main sources of information.<p>

The list contains the following headings:<br>
<a href="#uk">United Kingdom</a><br>
<a href="#Euro">European Aspects</a><br>
<a href="#Int">International Aspects</a><br>
<a href="#Add">Food Additives</a><br>
<a href="#Mis">Miscellaneous (including other countries)</a><p>

Many books on specific aspects of food science and technology include chapters on legal aspects and can be useful sources of more detailed information.  However, students should realise that legislation is constantly being modified and therefore always check the date of publication of a book or paper.<p>
In addition to books, journals can be useful sources of current thinking.  For the UK and some aspects of the EC, students should consult the 'British Food Journal' which contains major articles and shorter news items of interest.  For the USA, 'Food Technology' usually contains articles and information.  Other useful journals are 'Food Policy' and 'Food Control'.
