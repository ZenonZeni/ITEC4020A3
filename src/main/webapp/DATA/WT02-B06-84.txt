<H3>Text of Congressional Letter to Commerce Secretary Kantor regarding
Clipper 3.1.1</H3>

<P>The Honorable Michael Kantor<BR>
Secretary<BR>
Department of Commerce<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20230</P>

<P>Dear Secretary:</P>

<P>We write to express our serious concerns about the Administration's
most recent policy announcement on export restrictions on encryption technology.</P>

<P>First we agree with the October 4, 1996, New York Times editorial that
characterized the Administration's plan as &quot;needlessly restrictive
and probably unworkable&quot; and (though better than previous Administration
proposal) &quot;risks doing more harm than good.&quot; We recognize that
this issue involves a careful balancing of commercial, consumer, law enforcement
and national security considerations. However, the well-respected 1996
report by the National Research Council on this matter emphasized that
U.S. law enforcement and national security would be enhanced -- not weakened
-- by broader use of stronger U.S. encryption technologies both at home
and abroad. Furthermore, the report stressed that efforts to control international
trade in encryption technologies will only be effective if implemented
on a comprehensive, multilateral basis.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the Administration's most recent encryption initiative
shortchanges both U.S. business and law enforcement interests. The proposal
is flawed for four reasons: it fails to recognize that top-down, government-imposed
policies are doomed to defeat: export policies must be directly linked,
or indexed, to advances in technology; export controls must be fully multilateral
in order to be effective; and export control decisions will be further
delayed by granting the FBI new veto authority over U.S. exports.</P>

<P>We fear these defects will continue to leave U.S. companies at a disadvantage
in the world market, leave users of U.S. encryption uncertain about the
security of their information and leave U.S. law enforcement and national
security agencies behind the cryptography-curve.</P>

<P>Although we were not consulted in the formulation of this policy, we
nevertheless hope that in the coming months you will work with us and industry,
consumer and user groups to refine it further. In addition to conducting
oversight hearing in the next Congress on the Administration's proposal,
we also want to assure you that we will continue to pursue legislative
solutions toward this end.</P>

<P>Sincerely, </P>
