<h4>Executive Remuneration: Greenbury committee reports in UK</h4>

<p>Top executive remuneration has become one of the key issues in the continuing debate on corporate governance, a debate which is being held in countries across the world. Participants in and observers of this debate will be interested in the report of the Greenbury committee, the UK group of leading industrialists and institutional investors headed by the chairman of Marks & Spencer, Sir Richard Greenbury (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9504.html#uk">April 1995</a>). 

<p>The committee published its code of best practice for determining directors' remuneration on 17 July 1995. The code and report consider the full range of issues surrounding executive pay and are likely to have a significant impact on company practice. The key points are:

<ul>
<li>increased accountability to shareholders for directors' remuneration through full disclosure and a new code of best practice
<li>Stock Exchange invited to oblige listed companies to make full disclosure and an annual statement to shareholders about compliance with the code
<li>remuneration committees consisting exclusively of non-executive directors to determine remuneration policy and packages of individual executive directors
<li>annual reports to shareholders by remuneration committees to include full disclosure of company's remuneration policy and all elements in the remuneration packages of each individual director by name
<li>disclosure to include pension entitlements earned during the year, calculated on a basis to be recommended by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries
<li>remuneration committee reports to form a self-contained section in or annexed to the annual report and accounts
<li>chairman of remuneration committee to attend company's AGM to answer questions about directors' remuneration 
<li>remuneration committees' annual reports to shareholders not to be a standard AGM agenda item; but committees to consider each year whether circumstances are such that AGM should be invited to approve company's remuneration policies
<li>annual bonuses for directors to be subject to challenging performance criteria; part payment in shares to be considered; remuneration committee reports to justify any pensionability of bonuses if applicable
<li>all long-term incentive schemes, not just share option schemes, to be specifically approved by share-holders, whether payable in shares or cash
<li>long-term incentive schemes and traditional share options to be carefully weighed against each other, and preferably one or the other chosen as the means of rewarding outstanding performance; grants and rewards under all such schemes, including future grants under existing schemes, to be subject to challenging performance criteria
<li>option grants to be phased rather than awarded in one large block
<li>discounting of executive share option grants to be stopped
<li>government recommended to abolish present tax concessions for executive share options
<li>long-term shareholdings by directors in their companies to be encouraged
<li>compensation payments for loss of office to be reduced through shorter notice periods in contracts; periods above one year to be justified to shareholders; robust line to be taken on payment of compensation when performance has been unsatisfactory
<li>companies to consider phasing compensation payments and stopping them when the recipient is re-employed
<li>privatised water and energy companies to review existing remuneration packages, including share options, adjust them on a voluntary basis as necessary and make a full report for discussion by shareholders at first available AGM
<li>in future privatisations, no grants to be made under any share option schemes for at least six months, and preferably a year or more, after flotation.
</ul>

<p>The committee has reached some unexpected conclusions. One-year contracts, the abolition of income tax relief on executive share options and shareholder approval of all longer-term incentives are surprising proposals. However, the report is a positive contribution which will assist companies in setting their directors' remuneration. Although it makes a number of specific suggestions, companies should make their own judgements in deciding what is appropriate for them.

<h4>Pension investment returns beat inflation</h4>

<p>A survey of investment returns achieved by Brazilian pension plans in 1994 shows that their average performance was 15.6% above inflation.
The returns achieved in the last four years have all exceeded the rate assumed in actuarial assumptions (between 4% and 6% over inflation), as the table below illustrates.

<p>Average investment return
<pre>(net of inflation)
1994	15.6%
1993	19.0%
1992	10.2%
</pre>

<h2><a name="ca">CANADA</a></h2>
<h4>Update on executive pay disclosure</h4>

<p>The 1995 management proxy circulars of public companies provide the second opportunity to view the pay of Canadian executives on an individual basis since US-style disclosure was adopted in October 1993. On the basis of a review of the proxies of 70 large companies, fears that disclosure would drive pay levels upwards appear largely unfounded.

<p>Median salary increases for CEOs were 5%, and 25% of the CEOs in this group did not receive any increase during 1994. While real increases are high because of the low inflation environment, they are hardly excessive for a year of strong recovery. The average bonus paid to CEOs in this group increased by 60% over 1993 levels, but this was not surprising since   corporate profits increased three-fold over the same period. A number of companies also paid special bonuses to executives involved  in significant acquisitions or restructuring.
<p>There were no major changes in the size of stock option grants over the previous year, but a small but growing number of companies have introduced performance features into their stock option arrangements. This trend mirrors the experience of US companies following introduction of the new disclosure rules in 1992.

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION (EU)</a></h2>
<h4>Sex equality consensus threatened</h4>

<p>The modest degree of certainty over the law on sex discrimination in retirement benefit schemes achieved by recent European Court of Justice (ECJ) decisions could again be thrown into confusion by a proposed revised European Commission Directive on Equal Treatment. Until the areas of doubt are clarified, employers should continue to operate their plans on the basis of the ECJ's rulings.

<p>The proposed Directive omits many of the concessions which the ECJ has allowed for in recent decisions, including:

<ul>
<li>unequal bridging pensions
<li>sex-based actuarial factors for converting one type of benefit to another in defined benefit plans.
</ul>

<p>If the proposed Directive is adopted in this form, all member states in the EU will be required to introduce legislation to implement its provisions, which would appear to prohibit the concessions that have specifically been allowed by the ECJ. Employers will then have to comply with their domestic law and could be in breach of that law if they operate their plans to include any of these concessions.

<h4><a name="eu2">Commission backs away from legal action</a></h4>

<p>In spite of the European Commission's repeated statements that it will take court action against member states that impose restrictions on overseas investment of domestic pension fund assets (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9412.html#eu3">December 1994</a>), it now believes that it has found an alternative ¾ and less expensive ¾ course of action. This involves finding a private company that is prepared to take legal action against its government for restricting overseas investments, thereby contravening EU laws on free trade. If a company took such action and won, all member states would have to comply with the Commission's objective of liberalising pension fund assets within the EU.

<h4>Court rulings now affect social security charges potentially payable on retirement plan contributions</h4>

<p>Employers should either review the overall funding (external or internal) of their defined benefit retirement plans or, at the very least, modify the documents of the plans or the insurance contracts, following a number of recent court rulings concerning the so-called 85% rule (see below).
<p>Employers who pay contributions to group (life insurance, medical etc) and pension arrangements do not incur social security charges if the contributions are lower than 85% of the social security ceiling (with a sub-limit of 19% of the ceiling for group contributions only). This is known as the 85% rule.
<p>Traditionally, supplementary (ie above the mandatory ARRCO/AGIRC plans) defined benefit plan contributions were not included in the 85% rule because:

<ul>
<li>employees were regarded as not acquiring any pension rights until they reached retirement age
<li>contributions could not be apportioned between plan participants.
</ul>

<p>Over the last few years, court rulings have been inconsistent as to whether such employer contributions should be included in the 85% rule, but recent cases have all required employers to include defined benefit plan contributions in the 85% rule. It appears that this will be the final ruling on the subject.

<p>When the 85% rule limit is reached (which happens for higher paid employees), the excess is subject to social security charges from both the employer and the employee. An immediate review of defined benefit plans will help to minimise the impact of the court rulings.

<h4>General Survivor's Pension Act revised</h4>

<p>The Government has announced that, from 1 January 1996, there will be a drastic change in the state-provided benefits for widows and widowers, under the General Survivor's Pension Act (ANW). Employers should consider whether or not this change ¾ which mainly affects eligibility conditions ¾ should be compensated for by additional benefits from the employers' pension plans.
<p>The benefit for a survivor with a dependent child under the age of 18 will equal 90% of the net statutory minimum wage level or 70% for a survivor without a child. Under the new regime, only widows and widowers who bring up children under the age of 18 or are born before 1945 will be entitled to a general survivor's benefit. Previously, every survivor who was older than 40 years or brought up children under 18 received the benefit. Eligibility will be further restricted by the introduction of a means test.

<h2><a name="nz">NEW ZEALAND</a></h2>
<h4>Defined contribution survey results published</h4>

<p>New Zealand's main regulatory authority for superannuation schemes, the Government Actuary's Office, has recently published the results of a survey of defined contribution schemes. The survey contains much information of interest to employers. The highlights are listed below:

<ul>
<li>Despite the raising of the eligibility age for state-provided benefit to 65, most schemes continue to have a normal retirement age of 60.
<li>37% of schemes have 100% vesting of the employer's contribution within ten years of membership. There is no minimum legal vesting requirement.
<li>32% of schemes have an employer contribution of 10% of pay or above.
<li>Only 6% of schemes offer members a choice of where to invest their contributions.
</ul>

<p>Complete survey results are available from Mark Weaver on the number below.

<h2><a name="sg">SINGAPORE</a></h2>
<h4>Rules for expatriate  participation in CPF changed</h4>

<p>Following the Ministry of Labour's announcement on 10 July 1995 that, effective 1 August 1995, all expatriates will be exempt from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), employ-ers with expatriates who currently participate in the fund should either:

<ul>
<li>cover those employees either in a home country or off-shore pension programme (although, technically, these programmes may not be exempt from Singapore taxation), or
<li>renegotiate the employees' contract, possibly increasing pay to compensate for the elimination of the company's CPF contribution.
</ul>

<p>Although it is still possible for expatriates to participate on a voluntary basis, their contributions will be subject to normal taxation. The only exception is when the employer and employee agree in their contract of employment to contribute to CPF. In this case, the employee's contribution remains tax deductible but the employer's contribution is taxable to the employee. Given the low CPF interest rate (2% - 3% per annum) and the restricted access to funds, this is not an attractive option.

<p>The CPF is a defined contribution retirement programme with employee and employer contribution rates of 20% each, which is fully tax deductible. There is a cap on eligible earnings of S$6,000 per month for base salary, and bonuses are covered up to 40% of salary. Furthermore, when expatriates leave Singapore, the full account balance can be withdrawn without tax or other penalty.

<p>In the past, participation in the CPF was mandatory for all expatriates. Exemption was only granted to those who were covered under another (home country or offshore) pension plan. Because of the significant tax advantages of the CPF, some expatriates chose to participate even though they were covered by another plan.

<p>Expatriates currently working in Singapore and those who applied for passes before 1 August 1995, will continue to have tax-exempt CPF contributions until 31 December 1998. They and their companies must apply before the end of 1995 to continue their tax-exempt CPF contribution status. Employees who change employers lose their tax-exempt CPF status.

<p>Access to funds will continue to be limited to when a member permanently leaves Singapore. Thus, expatriates will need to leave their funds in the CPF (at 2% - 3% return) as long as they remain in Singapore.

<h2><a name="za">SOUTH AFRICA</a></h2>
<h4>Pension transfers required for Namibian members</h4>

<p>Namibian legislation now requires the establishment of locally registered funds for Namibian residents. Historically, many South African funds have had Namibian members because the former South West Africa was a protectorate of South Africa, and many organisations considered employees based there as part of the broader South African operation. The Namibian members will now be required to transfer to local funds. Transfer in respect of future service only appears to be the most effective course of action (see below).

<p>The opinion of the South African tax authorities is that:

<ul>
<li>if a transfer value is made in respect of past service, it will be subject to deduction of South African tax, as the Namibian fund is not approved in terms of the South African Income Tax Act, but
<li>tax exemption may be available in South Africa for pensions and lump sum benefits paid from a South African fund, where all or part of the benefit is in respect of service abroad, if less than two years' service out of ten years immediately prior to receipt of the benefit were in South Africa. If the benefit is not exempt  on this basis, then the taxable portion is the ratio of South African service to total service.
</ul>

<p>The Namibian authorities do not require that transfers be made to a newly established Namibian fund; in some instances, it may be preferable to retain paid-up benefits in the South African fund with future service only to accrue in the Namibian fund.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Government attempts to limit part-time claims</h4>

<p>The Government has introduced new regulations, effective from 31 May 1995, to bring UK law into line with European law following European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings in the Vroege and Fisscher cases, which dealt with admission of part-time employees to employers' benefit plans.

<p>Employers should urgently review any policies of excluding groups of employees from benefit plans or of offering entry on different terms. In particular, if part-time employees have not had the same rights as full-timers, employers should ensure that

<ul>
<li>this difference results from objectively justified factors which can be demonstrated and are unrelated to sex
<li>the exclusion does not apply to prevent a significantly greater number or proportion of one sex from joining the benefit plan.
</ul>

<p>If there is any possible discrimination that cannot be justified, employers must decide how to:

<ul>
<li>remove the discrimination
<li>determine what past service benefits are to be awarded to those employees who have suffered discrimination
<li>provide for the cost of these benefits.
</ul>

<h4><a name="uk2">Employment bills introduced</a></h4>
<p>Two new employment bills ¾ the Employment Rights Bill and the Industrial Tribunals Bill ¾ have been introduced into the House of Lords. Both bills consolidate existing law and are likely to take effect in January 1996.

<p>The Employment Rights Bill covers redundancy, maternity rights, unfair dismissal, suspension on health and safety grounds, deductions from pay, notice periods, Sunday working, written particulars of employment, rights to time off work, lay-offs and itemised pay statements.

<p>The Industrial Tribunals Bill deals with matters such as tribunal jurisdiction, membership and procedure, recouping social security benefits, conciliation and provisions concerning the Employment Appeal Tribunal.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>High Court upholds state surcharges on health plans</h4>

<p>The US Supreme Court, in a decision that surprised many legal experts and that holds troubling cost implications for employers, has ruled that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does not pre-empt a New York law impos-ing hospital surcharges on health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and commercially insured health plans. The Court's decision in the case (Travelers) may have a broad impact on employer health care costs, although it remains to be seen whether other states will now move to impose similar surcharges to help pay the cost of hospital care for uninsured and indigent patients.

<p>The New York law imposes a 13% surcharge on hospital bills paid by commercially insured plans and a 9% surcharge on HMOs that fail to enrol certain levels of Medicare patients. Insurers and HMOs had challenged the law, claiming it was barred by ERISA's provision pre-empting state laws that 'relate to' employer plans governed by ERISA. Hospital surcharges imposed by Connecticut and New Jersey were also challenged under ERISA in separate cases.

<p>In rejecting such challenges, the Supreme Court found unanimously that the state hospital surcharges have only an indirect economic effect on ERISA plans 'that can affect a plan's shopping decisions, but...does not affect the fact that any plan will shop for the best deal it can get...' The High Court sent the case back to the lower court to clarify the decision's specific impact on self-insured health plans.

<p>Whether other states will now rush to impose similar surcharges and how far states can go in imposing such taxes are both open questions under the ruling. The Travelers decision makes it clear, however, that the scope of ERISA pre-emption is not as broad as many employers had hoped.

<h4><a name="us2">SEC gives foreign companies a break on FAS 87</a></h4>

<p>Foreign-owned companies interested in selling their stock in the United States had some good news recently from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

<p>Under US law, companies must register their shares with the SEC in order to sell stock in the United States. As a condition of registration, foreign companies must either prepare their financial statements in accordance with US accounting standards or provide a reconciliation conforming their financial statements to US standards ¾ including FAS 87, the accrual accounting rule for pension expense.

<p>Some foreign registrants, especially first-time offerors in the US, have found it difficult to adopt FAS 87 as of the standard's 1989 effective date for non-US companies. Recently, however, the SEC staff indicated that they would not bar registration by foreign companies that can't adopt FAS 87 as of 1989 because actuarial data for past years is unavailable. Such companies will be allowed to adopt FAS 87 as of a later date, subject to certain conditions specified by the SEC staff. The SEC's new approach appears to offer foreign companies a reasonable, practical  and cost-effective alternative for reconciling pension cost under their local law with US accounting rules.
