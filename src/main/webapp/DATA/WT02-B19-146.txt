This area is supported by several well-equipped research laboratories: Applied Surface Thermodynamics (Prof. A.W. 
Neumann), Energetic Thermochemistry (Prof. S. McCahan), Photothermal and Optoelectronic (Prof. A. Mandelis), and 
Thermodynamics and Kinetics (Prof. C.A. Ward). <p>

Recent experimental results indicate that the 
conventional methods for predicting the rate of 
evaporation are inadequate. At the interface of an 
evaporating liquid, it is found experimentally that the 
temperature in the vapor is greater than that of the 
liquid. This is the opposite relation to that predicted by 
the current theories of liquid evaporation. A new theory 
of kinetics, called Statistical Rate Theory, is being applied 
to predict the rate of evaporation and to determine if it 
provides an explanation for the observed temperature 
discontinuity at the interface.<p>
