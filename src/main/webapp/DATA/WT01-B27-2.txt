<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control held a </p>

<p> 2day hearing in the 2d session of the 100th Congress to </p>

<p> examine the legalization of all illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> These informational hearings, entitled &quot;Legalization of </p>

<p> Illicit Drugs: Impact and Feasibility,&quot; were held in </p>

<p> response to public debate that began in early 1988, after </p>

<p> the mayor of Baltimore told a Washington, DC meeting of </p>

<p> the U.S. Conference of Mayors that existing U.S. drug </p>

<p> policy had failed. The mayor suggested legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization as possible approaches to solving the </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> The hearings were designed to consider the seriousness of </p>

<p> a variety of legalization proposals that had been offered </p>

<p> by drug policy observers who, after the Baltimore mayor's </p>

<p> call for a look at legalization, stepped up their own </p>

<p> criticisms of U.S. antidrug policy. In effect, they </p>

<p> pronounced the symbolic war on drugs lost. </p>

<p> Now that the hearings have been completed, and testimony </p>

<p> has been studied and restudied, the committee, led by </p>

<p> Chairman Charles B. Rangel and Ranking Member Benjamin </p>

<p> Gilman, has produced a list of findings resulting from the </p>

<p> many hours of testimony. </p>

<p> The findings are not for any specific legislative purpose. </p>

<p> Instead, they are intended solely as an advisory to any </p>

<p> Members of the U.S. Congress and the public as to what the </p>

<p> committee believes was established by the proceedings. </p>

<p> How the Hearings Evolved </p>

<p> In the spring of 1988, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke was </p>

<p> speaking to his colleagues at the U.S. Conference of </p>

<p> Mayors annual meeting on crime and drugs. During the </p>

<p> speech, Mayor Schmoke surprised the gathering when he </p>

<p> suggested that elected officials should consider the </p>

<p> legalization or the decriminalization of illicit drugs in </p>

<p> response to America's escalating drug crisis. </p>

<p> In his speech, Mayor Schmoke criticized America's current </p>

<p> antidrug approach as a wasteful proposition bent too far </p>

<p> toward law enforcement and not far enough toward treatment </p>

<p> and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Recalling his days as </p>

<p> a prosecuting attorney, Mayor Schmoke cited what he viewed </p>

<p> as the miniscule impact of arrests and convictions of drug </p>

<p> traffickers and drug users on the overall drug problem. </p>

<p> Schmoke's comments were the proverbial &quot;shots heard
around </p>

<p> the world,&quot; as few, if any, public officials had treaded
</p>

<p> into such politically explosive waters before on the </p>

<p> sensitive narcotics issue. </p>

<p> Select Committee Chairman Rangel (D-NY) responded almost </p>

<p> immediately to Mayor Schmoke's legalization calls. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel decried the notion as stemming from </p>

<p> frustration and exhasperation with the Nation's </p>

<p> mushrooming drug crisis. Chairman Rangel contended in </p>

<p> interviews and opinion articles that legalization would be </p>

<p> a tactical error in the war on drugs that would quite </p>

<p> possibly lead to a nation full of drug addicts. </p>

<p> Throughout the ensuing months after the hearing was </p>

<p> announced, people on both sides of the issue began </p>

<p> tangling publicly over the question. An informal national </p>

<p> debate had begun, and many looked toward the hearings </p>

<p> scheduled by Chairman Rangel as a final commentary on the </p>

<p> subject at least for the time being. </p>

<p> in calling for the hearings, Chairman Rangel expressed a </p>

<p> desire to get to the heart of suggestions being proposed </p>

<p> by legalization proponents. Although pro-legalization </p>

<p> advocates claimed they were simply calling for a debate on </p>

<p> the issue, Chairman Rangel impressed upon them that they </p>

<p> should come forward with specific plans and proposals, </p>

<p> rather than just debate the subject. Chairman Rangel made </p>

<p> a special plea with public officials suggesting </p>

<p> legalization or decriminalization to come forward with </p>

<p> specifics to satisfy the burden of their responsibility to </p>

<p> the American public. </p>

<p> Throughout the debate, Chairman Rangel asked legalization </p>

<p> advocates a series of questions in order that they might </p>

<p> clarify their positions. Among them: </p>

<p> (1) has anybody ever considered which narcotic and </p>

<p> psychotropic drugs might be legalized? </p>

<p> (2) would we allow all drugs to become legally sold and </p>

<p> used, or would we select the most abused few, such as </p>

<p> cocaine, heroin, and marijuana? </p>

<p> (3) who would administer the dosages-the State or the </p>

<p> individual? </p>

<p> (4) what quantity of drugs would each individual be </p>

<p> allowed to get? </p>

<p> (5) what about addicts, would we not have to give them </p>

<p> more in order to satisfy their craving, or would we give </p>

<p> them enough just to whet their appetites? </p>

<p> (6) what do we do about those who are experimenting? Do </p>

<p> we sell them drugs, too, and encourage them to pick up the </p>

<p> habit? (7) furthermore, will the government establish tax- </p>

<p> supported facilities to sell these drugs? </p>

<p> (8) would we get the supply from the same foreign </p>

<p> countries that support our habit now, or would we create </p>

<p> our own internal sources? </p>

<p> (9) would there be an age limit on purchases, as is the </p>

<p> case with alcohol? </p>

<p> (10) how many people are projected to become addicts as a </p>

<p> result of legalization? </p>

<p> (11) what about pilots, railroad engineers, surgeons, </p>

<p> police, cross-country truckers and nuclear plant employees </p>

<p> who want to use marijuana and cocaine during off-duty </p>

<p> hours? </p>

<p> (12) what about crack cocaine as a legalized drug? Would </p>

<p> we want to legalize something as harmful and as </p>

<p> destructive to our youth as this? </p>

<p> Legalization: A Recurring Theme </p>

<p> The legalization debate seems to rise to the surface when </p>

<p> the drug crisis reaches alarming levels, as it has </p>

<p> recently. The drug issue eventually moved to the top of </p>

<p> the list of Americans' concerns during 1988, given the </p>

<p> spate of news stories on the growing influence of the </p>

<p> narcotics trade in everyday lives. </p>

<p> Throughout the year, there were revelations from the </p>

<p> Select Committee on Narcotics and other congressional </p>

<p> committees about the suspected involvement of some foreign </p>

<p> leaders in the drug trade. Americans were also bombarded </p>

<p> by reports of the increased prevalence of deadly, </p>

<p> addictive crack cocaine; growing gang involvement in the </p>

<p> narcotics trade; a tripling of cocaine imports to the </p>

<p> United States in the 1980's; a significant rise in drug- </p>

<p> related violence sparked by tension between warring </p>

<p> traffickers and by street dealers bent on attention- </p>

<p> getting retaliatory tactics. </p>

<p> At the time of the hearing, one major news poll revealed </p>

<p> that the American public was more concerned about the </p>

<p> crisis of illegal drugs than about any other issue- </p>

<p> including the budget deficit. </p>

<p> The ABC News polling data also indicated that Americans </p>

<p> were wary of legalization, Nine out of ten opposed </p>

<p> legalizing all drugs and about 50 percent of the </p>

<p> respondents feared drug use would rise under legalization. </p>

<p> In a Gallup survey released 2 months prior to the hearing, </p>

<p> about 75 percent of those surveyed were opposed and nearly </p>

<p> 70 percent felt that legalization would aggravate the </p>

<p> Nation's drug problem. </p>

<p> Through the years, advocates of legalization have favored </p>

<p> an end to existing drug laws, often using the end of </p>

<p> Prohibition in the 1930's and the end of organized crime's </p>

<p> involvement in the illegal liquor trade as an example in </p>

<p> making their case. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel, on the other hand, asked of legalization </p>

<p> advocates in 1988: What drugs would we legalize? Who </p>

<p> would manufacture and distribute them? In what </p>

<p> neighborhoods would they be sold and marketed? Would </p>

<p> crack cocaine be legalized in a legalization scheme? </p>

<p> Would there be age and quantity limits on purchases? How </p>

<p> much would we give addicts, enough to satisfy their </p>

<p> craving? </p>

<p> Other opponents of the legalization theory suggested that </p>

<p> in addition to a potential meteoric rise in addictions, </p>

<p> there is no guarantee that the black market for drugs </p>

<p> would close down, especially if restrictions are placed on </p>

<p> purchase quantity and on the quality of various narcotic </p>

<p> substances. </p>

<p> Overview of the Proceedings </p>

<p> Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30, 1988, were 2 </p>

<p> significant days in the 100th Congress regarding the drug </p>

<p> issue. In those 2 days, a total of 34 witnesses </p>

<p> representing Congress, law enforcement, government, </p>

<p> academia, and various drug-related interest groups </p>

<p> testified before the Select Committee on Narcotics on </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> By the time the hearing commenced, the legalization issue </p>

<p> had gained such national exposure that the proceedings </p>

<p> were carried live over public television and public radio, </p>

<p> and was covered by a large contingent of print media. At </p>

<p> this point and time in 1988, legalization was a very </p>

<p> important topic to many Americans concerned about the </p>

<p> worsening drug crisis. </p>

<p> In addition to the announced lineup of witnesses, several </p>

<p> Members of Congress who do not serve on the Select </p>

<p> Committee on Narcotics offered testimony on the subject. </p>

<p> Representative Carroll Hubbard (D-KY) and Representative </p>

<p> Roy Dyson (D-MD) both told the panel that the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis had become more than just a problem in urban </p>

<p> America. In rural areas served by both those Members, </p>

<p> there has been a noticeable increase in narcotics-related </p>

<p> problems. Representative Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) warned </p>

<p> about the confused messages that would be sent to the </p>

<p> youth if drugs were legalized. Representative Kwesi Mfume </p>

<p> (D-MD) also outlined his opposition, but said that more </p>

<p> attention should be given to demand reduction. </p>

<p> Following is a summary of the statement of each witness. </p>

<p> The summary is intended to capture the essence of what the </p>

<p> witness presented to the panel in his or her opening </p>

<p> statement, and is not a verbatim translation of the actual </p>

<p> testimony. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> 1. The ideas and recommendations of pro-legalization </p>

<p> forces remain varied and wide ranging. There is no </p>

<p> commonly agreed upon approach that should be taken to </p>

<p> legalize illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> 2. The American public remains largely opposed to the </p>

<p> notion of legalizing illicit drugs. </p>

<p> 3. There is no data to support the theory that </p>

<p> legalizing illicit drugs would result in less crime, more </p>

<p> affordable narcotics or decreased drug experimentation, </p>

<p> abuse or addiction. </p>

<p> 4. There is no agreement on the types of currently </p>

<p> illicit drugs that should be considered for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> 5. No definitive information exists that would show how </p>

<p> America's youth would be affected by legalization, whether </p>

<p> positively or negatively. </p>

<p> 6. There should be a stepped up effort to look at the </p>

<p> expansion of treatment and rehabilitation resources around </p>

<p> the country. </p>

<p> 7. The Federal war on drugs must devote more resources </p>

<p> to curbing drug trafficking and abuse in major U.S. </p>

<p> cities. </p>

<p> 8. Narcotics law enforcement efforts need to be </p>

<p> improved, especially in major U.S. cities) </p>

<p> 9. Training for the staff of drug abuse treatment </p>

<p> centers needs to be expanded and improved. </p>

<p> 10. Federal drug abuse policies need more input from </p>

<p> residents of major American cities and not just from </p>

<p> governmental leaders,police chiefs, and substance abuse </p>

<p> professionals. </p>

<p> 11. The burden of proof regarding the benefits of drug </p>

<p> legalization must be placed on the advocates of such a </p>

<p> policy. Until the proponents of drug legalization can </p>

<p> demonstrate that the benefits of such a policy outweigh </p>

<p> the risks to health and drug-related violeiiee, drug </p>

<p> legalization should be rejected. </p>

<p> 12. American schools should continue to convey the </p>

<p> message that drug abuse is against the law, harmful to </p>

<p> health, and a detriment to optimal academic performance. </p>

<p> 13. Employee assistance programs [EAP's] in government </p>

<p> and industry must be strengthened to help employees and </p>

<p> their families deal effectively with drug abuse, </p>

<p> 14. We have not yet begun to fight the war. </p>

<p> Consequently, legalization should not be considered an </p>

<p> alternative. </p>

<p> Summary of Statements by Members of Congress </p>

<p> CHAIRMAN CHARLES B. RANGEL (D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROT. </p>

<p> Legalization has been widely discussed in academic </p>

<p> settings, and on radio and TV talk shows. But this is the </p>

<p> first time in a long time the issue has made its way to </p>

<p> the Congress. </p>

<p> Most of those who have been advocating legalization have </p>

<p> been calling for either a debate, a discussion or a </p>

<p> consideration. But after an advance reading of some of </p>

<p> the testimony, it does not appear that any of the </p>

<p> witnesses are truly'advocating legalization. </p>

<p> Some are saying legalization ought to be discussed because </p>

<p> the war on drugs is being lost with law enforcement. But </p>

<p> the Nation has yet to declare a real war on drugs. </p>

<p> For 8 years, the Congress has met resistance to antidrug </p>

<p> efforts. The Reagan administration has shied away from </p>

<p> providing funds to State and local governments so that </p>

<p> they can fight the war on drugs. </p>

<p> How can we say we have a war on drugs when a total of </p>

<p> 2,800 DEA men and women are dedicated to fighting the war </p>

<p> on drugs at the Federal level? </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents are calling for a greater </p>

<p> educational and rehabilitative commitment, but we do not </p>

<p> even have a single federally run rehabilitation program. </p>

<p> Some say we must do more with drug education, but so far </p>

<p> we have only had slogans like &quot;Just Say No&quot; and
&quot;Zero </p>

<p> Tolerance.&quot; </p>

<p> No opium or coca leaves are grown in this country, yet the </p>

<p> Secretary of State never utters his contempt for the </p>

<p> nations where these poisons are grown. </p>

<p> Legalization proponents must be prepared to discuss their </p>

<p> ideas and recommendations in detail. </p>

<p> HON. LAWRENCE COUGHLIN (R-PA), RANKING MINORITY MEMBER, </p>

<p> SELECT COMMITTEE: ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Having a hearing on legalization could send a wrong </p>

<p> message to America's young people that drugs are OK. </p>

<p> Having a discussion could be a copout in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> The hope is that the hearing will not be interpreted as an </p>

<p> indication that legalization is being suggested. </p>

<p> To quote the attorney general of Pennsylvania, Leroy </p>

<p> Zimmerman, &quot;In Philadelphia, over 50 percent of the
child </p>

<p> abuse fatalities involved parents who heavily used </p>

<p> cocaine. Cheaper, legal cocaine would result in more </p>

<p> children dying and more babies being born addicted.&quot; </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN (R-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drug kingpins are Continuing to cash in on America's </p>

<p> insatiable appetite for illicit drugs. These </p>

<p> multinational criminal syndicates have built evil empires </p>

<p> from the drug trade. </p>

<p> The power of the drug trade threatens the authority of </p>

<p> governments worldwide. Colombia, for example, is </p>

<p> virtually under siege from the traffickers, </p>

<p> When the narcotics trade recently offered the Colombian </p>

<p> people the money to pay off the nation's foreign debt, the </p>

<p> people refused, resisting the financial temptation and </p>

<p> opting to take the moral high ground. </p>

<p> Those calling for legalization in America are seeking to </p>

<p> compromise the same values and morals that remain at stake </p>

<p> in Colombia. They are looking to cut a deal with the drug </p>

<p> trade. </p>

<p> Legalization would not put an end to the international </p>

<p> cartels, who would figure out ways to adapt and penetrate </p>

<p> the U.S. market. It would not end drug-related crime, as </p>

<p> many addicts on the street would continue to commit </p>

<p> criminal acts because of impaired judgment and instability </p>

<p> from illicit drug use. </p>

<p> It is hoped that fresh, new ideas will emerge from the </p>

<p> hearings that will make the Nation more effective in the </p>

<p> war on drugs. </p>

<p> HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK (D-CA), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> In New York and Oakland, only about 10 percent of the </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin addicts are able to be treated for </p>

<p> their addictions. In both cities, people seeking drug </p>

<p> treatment are required to wait at least 6 months for </p>

<p> treatment. Drug-related crime has skyrocketed as a result </p>

<p> of a lack of treatment slots. </p>

<p> Legalization is not the answer. We must find a way to </p>

<p> treat the drug abuser. </p>

<p> I am introducing a bill to provide treatment for addicts </p>

<p> seeking help. The bill would be financed through the </p>

<p> Social Security Programs' disability insurance provisions </p>

<p> and utilize a Medicare-like payment principal for </p>

<p> outpatient and inpatient services. </p>

<p> HoN. JAMES H. SCHEUER(D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The ultimate copout in the war on drugs is to stand pat </p>

<p> with the current ineffective drug control policy. Pumping </p>

<p> more resources into a transparently failed system would be </p>

<p> an admission of defeat in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Our system has totally failed. If seizures, arrests, and </p>

<p> convictions are going up, then so is violence and </p>

<p> addiction. We must end the preoccupation with the </p>

<p> criminal justice aspect of the problem and focus more on </p>

<p> education and treatment. </p>

<p> A new system and a new strategy would involve changing </p>

<p> people's behavior. We have successfully changed attitudes </p>

<p> and behavior on alcohol and tobacco consumption. </p>

<p> The question is, How do we reduce the demand for drugs? </p>

<p> We need to examine the costs and benefits of police </p>

<p> crackdowns. We have to address a broad spectrum of </p>

<p> options and put substantially more resources into those </p>

<p> programs that really work. </p>

<p> HON. CARDISS COLLINS (D-IL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs have been a problem for many years. It is one of </p>

<p> the greatest public evils in the United States. </p>

<p> The present administration has demonstrated a profound </p>

<p> lack of understanding on the drug issue. The First Lady </p>

<p> has told us to &quot;Just Say No,&quot; while the President
has said </p>

<p> no to an effective policy to rapidly eradicate drug crops </p>

<p> from society. </p>

<p> It seems incontrovertible that the immediate effect of </p>

<p> legalization would be rampant drug use. This would occur </p>

<p> for at least a short period, as the lion that has been </p>

<p> held captive for many years would be let out of the den. </p>

<p> Even if legalization were to have the desired effect, it </p>

<p> would not work until the lion became accustomed to the new </p>

<p> liberties. That could be a very long time, and the Nation </p>

<p> could not afford to wait. </p>

<p> Legalization could lead to a legal and constitutional </p>

<p> quagmire, in which the newly legal rights of individuals </p>

<p> must be merged with the obligation to protect society. </p>

<p> HON. DANIEL K. AKAKA (D-HI), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The issue is not whether we ought to sanction the use of </p>

<p> drugs, but whether legalization can break the stranglehold </p>

<p> that drugs have had on our communities. </p>

<p> We have contended that drugs affect all of us, not just </p>

<p> users and pushers. That has never been more apparent than </p>

<p> it is today. </p>

<p> HON. FRANK J. GUARINI (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Legalization is not the cure for the Nation's drug </p>

<p> problems. It is the wrong policy, and it sends the wrong </p>

<p> signal. It sends the signal to the drug lords that the </p>

<p> Nation has lost, and they have won. It tells America's </p>

<p> youth that the U.S. Government says yes to drugs. </p>

<p> People should be motivated so that they don't need drugs. </p>

<p> They need to be given something to believe in. A sense of </p>

<p> purpose and a spirit of idealism need to be renewed in </p>

<p> America. Hope and dreams should replace despair and </p>

<p> hunger. </p>

<p> There should be a dialog on the issue, as it may in the </p>

<p> long run contribute to bringing an end to the drug crisis. </p>

<p> HoN. DANTE B. FASCELL (D-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The fight against drugs must focus on interdiction, </p>

<p> education, and rehabilitation. We just passed an oninibus </p>

<p> drug bill in the House, but no matter how vigorously we </p>

<p> attack the problem, we must key on reducing demand. </p>

<p> The issue should be discussed, and all views should get a </p>

<p> fair hearing. But legalization and decriminalization are </p>

<p> not the solutions to the drug problem. </p>

<p> A clear connection has been established between crime and </p>

<p> drugs. While many individuals commit crimes to get drugs, </p>

<p> others who commit crimes are found to have used illicit </p>

<p> drugs just prior to the commission of the crime. </p>

<p> Legalization will compound the situation because drugs </p>

<p> will be easier to obtain. It sends a misguided and </p>

<p> contradictory signal. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, how would we be able to tell our </p>

<p> kids to stay off drugs? How can we urge other countries </p>

<p> to work with us in interdiction and eradication efforts? </p>

<p> We must increase aid to State and local law agencies. </p>

<p> Efforts must be concentrated on interdiction, demand </p>

<p> reduction, and on rehabilitation and education. </p>

<p> HON. WILLIAM J. HUGHES (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am very much opposed to legalization. This view comes </p>

<p> after reflecting on 24 years as either a prosecutor or a </p>

<p> Member of Congress. </p>

<p> Where in the entire world has legalization worked? </p>

<p> Witnesses would do well to indicate this to the committee </p>

<p> in testimony. Also, indicate to the committee how the </p>

<p> profits are going to be removed from the drug trade under </p>

<p> legalization. The black market will not be eliminated. </p>

<p> Policies of recent years are workable if they are followed </p>

<p> with the proper commitment. To date, the commitment has </p>

<p> not been made in terms of effort and resources. </p>

<p> The Nation's strategy is good. Many of the provisions in </p>

<p> the omnibus drug bill advance us in the right direction. </p>

<p> Once the Nation gets serious about the problem, we will </p>

<p> begin to turn the corner. </p>

<p> HoN. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ (D-TX), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs take away the God-given gift of human potential that </p>

<p> we all have. Illegal drugs are damaging our children, our </p>

<p> communities and our Nation as a whole. None of this would </p>

<p> change under legalization. </p>

<p> The question of legalization is not one of economics or </p>

<p> money or the black market. </p>

<p> The position of those who advocate legalization is </p>

<p> recognized. But when reasonable people discuss </p>

<p> unreasonable proposals, it is a sad commentary on the </p>

<p> impact that illegal drugs have had on society. </p>

<p> HoN. KWEISI MFUMF (D-MD), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am extremely opposed to the concept of legalization. </p>

<p> However, it is important that the debate take place. </p>

<p> Both sides in the debate agree on one thing: Illicit drugs </p>

<p> are tearing our Nation apart. It is estimated that some </p>

<p> 23 million Americans use illicit drugs once monthly. A </p>

<p> total of 6 million of these people use cocaine. Young </p>

<p> people in the United States use illicit drugs more than </p>

<p> their counterparts in any other nation of the world. </p>

<p> Proponents argue that legalization would remove the profit </p>

<p> motive. That may very well be, but drug use is driven by </p>

<p> demand and that's where more attention needs to be focused </p>

<p> nationally. </p>

<p> History shows that drugs made legal for adult consumption </p>

<p> cannot be kept out of the hands of children. Under </p>

<p> legalization, more children and young people would </p>

<p> experiment with drugs, as is the case with alcohol. It </p>

<p> has been estimated that about 75 percent of all drug users </p>

<p> become addicted. </p>

<p> Proponents often point to England and Holland as models </p>

<p> for a legalization proposal. But the concept has not </p>

<p> worked in either of those two countries. The policy of </p>

<p> legalized heroin had to be discontinued in England as the </p>

<p> number of heroin users increased and the black market </p>

<p> continued to thrive. In Amsterdam, Holland, where </p>

<p> marijuana is legal, crime and hard drug use remains a </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> An additional consideration is the threat of babies born </p>

<p> to drugaddicted mothers. That probably would be </p>

<p> exacerbated under legalization. So would other problems, </p>

<p> such as car and train accidents and corruption. </p>

<p> The U.S. focus on eliminating the drug problem should </p>

<p> expand beyond the one-dimensional effort to stop the </p>

<p> supply. More focus should be placed on demand reduction, </p>

<p> specifically treatment and rehabilitation. </p>

<p> If the United States is fighting a war on drugs, the </p>

<p> battlefields are not in Colombia and Bolivia, but rather </p>

<p> in our schools and our communities. </p>

<p> HON. MICHAEL OXLEY (R-OH), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The idea of legalization should not even be dignified with </p>

<p> a 2-day hearing by the committee. </p>

<p> Consideration of the notion of legalization sends a bad </p>

<p> message to the rest of the Nation and to the rest of the </p>

<p> world. America's teenagers who may be considering </p>

<p> experimenting with drugs may see that legalization is </p>

<p> being considered and think that it is now OK to use drugs. </p>

<p> Legalization is unacceptable in a civilized society. </p>

<p> My hope for an outcome to the hearings is that the book on </p>

<p> legalization will be closed once and for all. </p>

<p> HON. Tom LEWIS (R-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE </p>

<p> AND CONTROL </p>

<p> It is contradictory that those committed to fighting drugs </p>

<p> have agreed to give a hearing to the legalization issue. </p>

<p> Making drugs more affordable and more available could be </p>

<p> detrimental to society. Particularly objectionable is the </p>

<p> view of legalization advocates that the government itself </p>

<p> can make a profit from the drug trade. </p>

<p> Legalizing drug profits and making dealers out of the </p>

<p> government and private citizens is appalling. </p>

<p> HON. CARROLL HUBBARD, JR. (D-KY) </p>

<p> The urban drug problem is well known. But the war on </p>

<p> drugs needs to be fought in rural America, as well. The </p>

<p> drug problem is acute and serious in outlying areas. </p>

<p> In my own congressional district, in western Kentucky, the </p>

<p> U.S. Customs Service is aware of the severity of the drug </p>

<p> problem. They and the Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p> know of contraband-carrying flights from Colombia and </p>

<p> Mexico that arrive at our rural airports. These small </p>

<p> airports are safer for drug dealers than flying into </p>

<p> places like New Orleans and Miami. </p>

<p> I hope that the Congress will be able to lead the public </p>

<p> and our government away from legalization. I hope that </p>

<p> those who are proposing legalization would realize that </p>

<p> more people would experiment with drugs under Such a plan. </p>

<p> In my district, even the schools are not immune to the </p>

<p> drug trade. At a grand jury hearing last December in </p>

<p> Bowling Green, I testified that there were individuals </p>

<p> selling drugs to Western Kentucky University students. My </p>

<p> wife and I received death threats as a result of my </p>

<p> testimony, in which names were revealed. </p>

<p> Like others, I wonder what we can do to increase education </p>

<p> about drug abuse, and move as a nation toward a spiritual, </p>

<p> rather than chemical, dependence. </p>

<p> HON. ROBERT GARCIA (D-NY) </p>

<p> Legalization poses dangerous repercussions for the Nation. </p>

<p> It cannot be risked. It could not be sustained. </p>

<p> The legalization proposal comes at a time when public </p>

<p> opinion toward drug abuse is beginning to take a turn for </p>

<p> the positive, and after the House has just passed major </p>

<p> antidrug legislation to improve on the 1986 antidrug bill. </p>

<p> Given the problems we continue to experience with tobacco </p>

<p> and alcohol, the risks of legalization are just too great. </p>

<p> The biggest concern about legalization is the effect that </p>

<p> it would have on America's youth. Legalization would </p>

<p> result in the widespread use of drugs, especially among </p>

<p> youth. The greatest impact would be felt in minority </p>

<p> communities and in the inner city. </p>

<p> As long as there are drug users who cannot afford drugs </p>

<p> legally, there will be a black market. Unless we legalize </p>

<p> all drugs-including crack, PCP, LSD-and unless we make </p>

<p> them universally available, there will be crime. </p>

<p> Legalization fails to take into account whether special </p>

<p> restrictions would have to be placed on pilots, law </p>

<p> officers, truck drivers and others in hazardous </p>

<p> occupations. It also fails to consider the spread of AIDS </p>

<p> through intravenous drug use. </p>

<p> HON. Roy DYSON (D-MD) </p>

<p> Legalization is a foolhardy and reckless proposal that </p>

<p> would have a negative impact on the family. </p>

<p> The drug problem has filtered down to rural America. In </p>

<p> one of the counties located in my district, the number of </p>

<p> drug offenses rose 114 percent from 1986 to 1987. </p>

<p> Activists like Timothy Leary, Alan Ginsberg and Jerry </p>

<p> Rubin 20 years ago advocated that drug use was okay and </p>

<p> should be accepted as a form of escapism from the rough </p>

<p> times of the real world. But over the past 20 years, we </p>

<p> have seen the personal and financial ruin that drug use </p>

<p> brings about. </p>

<p> Under legalization, America would become enslaved to </p>

<p> drugs. Decriminalization is simply a backdoor way of </p>

<p> legalizing narcotics. </p>

<p> Legalization would send a bad message. It would increase </p>

<p> drug use and addiction. It would result in the </p>

<p> expenditure of billions of additional dollars in health </p>

<p> care costs and in lost productivity. </p>

<p> We must begin teaching our children at an early age about </p>

<p> the dangers of harmful drugs. Though education must play </p>

<p> a vital role in our antidrug efforts, we must still </p>

<p> initiate stiff sanctions against those who grow, use and </p>

<p> sell illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN (D-MD) </p>

<p> In a survey of my Third Congressional District (portions </p>

<p> of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County), 69 </p>

<p> percent of the respondents oppose legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization. </p>

<p> A war on drugs cannot be won unless the profit is taken </p>

<p> out of the drug trade. But decriminalization is not the </p>

<p> way to accomplish that. </p>

<p> Constituents are saying that our discussions on the </p>

<p> national drug debate should also take into account the </p>

<p> damage from other harmful substances, such as alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes. </p>

<p> More money should be focused on establishing effective </p>

<p> treatment and education programs if a real war on drugs is </p>

<p> going to be waged. </p>

<p> What is needed is a comprehensive approach combining </p>

<p> foreign and domestic policy sensitive to the urgency of </p>

<p> interdiction efforts, stricter enforcement, more resources </p>

<p> to educate our youth to the dangers of drugs and treatment </p>

<p> programs without waiting lists. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Thursday, September 29, 1988 </p>

<p> MAYOR KURT L, SCHMOKE, BALTIMORE </p>

<p> America needs to reexamine its current drug policy. The </p>

<p> Nation is spending about $10 billion annually to enforce </p>

<p> drug laws that are catching only a fraction of the </p>

<p> violators. </p>

<p> The drug problem in America is defined in two components: </p>

<p> addiction and crime. Law enforcement is unable to resolve </p>

<p> either of these two problems and actually has worsened the </p>

<p> crime problem. The black market is a result of the </p>

<p> manufacture and sale of cocaine being criminalized and </p>

<p> profits from drug sale-, are enormous because the </p>

<p> substances cannot be obtained legally. </p>

<p> Nationwide, there were 750,000 drug arrests in 1987 and </p>

<p> Baltimore had 12,000 drug arrests, yet both represent only </p>

<p> a fraction of the drug violators. Prisons and jails are </p>

<p> packed with drug offenders, One-third of all Federal </p>

<p> prisoners are incarcerated on drug offenses. </p>

<p> Cigarettes kill hundreds of thousands, but no move has </p>

<p> been made to make them illegal. Antismoking campaigns and </p>

<p> other </p>

<p> Neither PCP nor LSD should be legalized. But a </p>

<p> maintenance system involving designated hospitals should </p>

<p> be implemented for cocaine and heroin abusers, with the </p>

<p> opportunity for abusers to enroll in a treatment program </p>

<p> aimed at reducing the intake of either of these drugs down </p>

<p> to zero. </p>

<p> MAYOR EDWARD I. KOCH OF NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Mayor Schmoke's proposal to maintain heroin and cocaine </p>

<p> addicts is not new. The concept has been tried in Great </p>

<p> Britain, and it has failed. Addiction and crime both rose </p>

<p> as a result of doctorprescribed drug maintenance in that </p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> Legally received cocaine could be turned into the </p>

<p> derivative crack by mixing in baking soda or some other </p>

<p> base in the heating process. This would be a </p>

<p> surreptitious way for crack addicts to obtain their fix if </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin were legalized and prescribed. </p>

<p> Organized crime still, would play a role in drug </p>

<p> production and distribution for those who are either </p>

<p> underage or cannot get the amount and quality they desire. </p>

<p> In Great Britain, 84 percent of the government-registered </p>

<p> addicts during that country's heroin maintenance program </p>

<p> were discovered to be using other drugs illicitly. </p>

<p> With a population of 240 million people and about 6 </p>

<p> million regular drug users in that group, drugs still </p>

<p> remain unacceptable and drug users remain a sizable </p>

<p> minority in the Nation. If legalization were to go into </p>

<p> effect, there would be a gradual acceptability that would </p>

<p> lead to an increase in users. </p>

<p> There is little distinction between decriminalization and </p>

<p> legalization, and both are bad ideas that should be </p>

<p> opposed. </p>

<p> MAYOR DENNIS CALLAHAN OF ANNAPOLIS, MD </p>

<p> The most compelling argument for not supporting the notion </p>

<p> of legalization comes from the problems our society </p>

<p> currently experiences with alcohol. According to the </p>

<p> Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, alcohol </p>

<p> abuse costs America about $117 billion annually in </p>

<p> medical, property, productivity and other losses. Of this </p>

<p> amount, only about $2,5 billion related to law enforcement </p>

<p> costs while the rest concerned accidents and other </p>

<p> problems associated with the abuse of alcohol. </p>

<p> Even marijuana should not be legalized. Advocates for </p>

<p> legalizing only this drug claim an overdose of it would </p>

<p> only put the user to sleep, but they could be asleep while </p>

<p> at the controls of a locomotive or another vehicle. </p>

<p> In Alaska, marijuana can be grown legally on private plots </p>

<p> and it can be consumed on the premises. A survey of </p>

<p> 250,000 high school students done by the Atlanta-based </p>

<p> organization, Parents' Resource Institute, indicates that </p>

<p> about one in five of those surveyed admitted to smoking </p>

<p> marijuana. About one in two of those surveyed in Alaska </p>

<p> admitted to smoking marijuana. It appears that the </p>

<p> sanctioning of marijuana use has contributed significantly </p>

<p> to the much higher usage figure in this State compared to </p>

<p> the rest of the Nation. </p>

<p> HoN. JACK LAWN, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p> Drugs are not bad because they are illegal. Instead, </p>

<p> drugs are illegal because they are bad, and legalization </p>

<p> advocates are missing the point in blaming drug laws for </p>

<p> the crime and violence that has resulted from the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis. </p>

<p> The problems that we continue to experience with legalized </p>

<p> alcohol use provide strong evidence that legalization </p>

<p> would be a bad idea. Greater availability results in </p>

<p> greater use and greater abuse. </p>

<p> The National Council on Alcoholism reports that one of </p>

<p> every three American adults contends that alcohol has </p>

<p> brought them family trouble. About 100,000 10- and 11- </p>

<p> year-olds reported getting drunk once weekly in 1985, and </p>

<p> about 100,000 deaths a year in the United States can be </p>

<p> attributed to alcoholism. Of that number, 23,000 are </p>

<p> killed on highways and cirrhosis of the liver is the </p>

<p> sixthleading cause of death in America. </p>

<p> The United States is signatory to the Single Convention on </p>

<p> Drugs of 1961, and to the Convention of Psychotropic Drugs </p>

<p> of 1971. Both these treaties require the country to </p>

<p> establish and maintain effective controls on illicit </p>

<p> substances. The sanctity of these treaties and U.S. </p>

<p> credibility in the international right against drug abuse </p>

<p> would be severely damaged if these substances were </p>

<p> legalized. </p>

<p> Legalization would adversely affect.young people and the </p>

<p> crime rate. The American public has said in recent </p>

<p> opinion polls that it opposes legalization. </p>

<p> Legalization is a simple answer to a complex problem. The </p>

<p> answer in fighting the drug crisis comes from focusing </p>

<p> more on demand reduction efforts. </p>

<p> ARTHUR C. &quot;CAPPY&quot; EADS, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,
NATIONAL </p>

<p> DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 27TH </p>

<p> JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, BELTON, TX </p>

<p> The whole notion of legalizing drugs ignores the reason </p>

<p> why drugs were made illegal in the first place. They are </p>

<p> bad for the user, the community and society as a whole. </p>

<p> Drug use often translates into child neglect and abuse, </p>

<p> runaways, molestation and other crimes and maladies that </p>

<p> result from individuals being under the influence of </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> It is wrong to assume that funding for enforcement versus </p>

<p> funding for treatment and rehabilitation are distinctly </p>

<p> different, and that they are competing categories, as both </p>

<p> areas must be adequately funded for an effective antidrug </p>

<p> strategy. Effective treatment programs are essential in </p>

<p> sentencing drug offenders, while sanctions against drug </p>

<p> use are critical components of a treatment and prevention </p>

<p> strategy. </p>

<p> We have yet to implement in the United States, a full- </p>

<p> scale attack on the drug problem combining law </p>

<p> enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts into an </p>

<p> effective strategy. </p>

<p> HON. STERLING JOHNSON, JR., SPECIAL NARCOTICS PROSECUTOR, </p>

<p> NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Calls for legalization are borne from frustration with an </p>

<p> inadequate response from the executive branch of the </p>

<p> government. Unfortunately, not one single piece of </p>

<p> antidrug legislation has come from the executive branch of </p>

<p> the government. The only major antidrug legislation has </p>

<p> come from Congress. </p>

<p> It is improbable that heroin addicts could be </p>

<p> maintained, as Mayor Schmoke contends. If an addict's </p>

<p> habit is maintained at a certain level, over time the </p>

<p> level of that addict's habit will rise. The black market </p>

<p> would remain in existence under legalization. Further, </p>

<p> the matter of whether doctors, pilots and other people in </p>

<p> sensitive occupations would be allowed to use legal drugs </p>

<p> must be examined closely. </p>

<p> Legalized drugs will not stop crime, and the experience </p>

<p> with prescribed heroin in Great Britain provides evidence </p>

<p> that a downward trend in crime is not necessarily the case </p>

<p> of lessened restrictions on drug use. </p>

<p> Finally, the concept of free needles, which is supported </p>

<p> by Mayor Schmoke and also New York Citv Mayor Koch, is a </p>

<p> bad idea. It sends out erroneous signals that conflict </p>

<p> with any and all efforts to put an end to the use of </p>

<p> harmful illicit drugs. </p>

<p> JERALD VAUGHN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL </p>

<p> ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE </p>

<p> The IACP represents more than 15,000 top-level law </p>

<p> enforcement executives in the United States. The group is </p>

<p> unequivocally opposed to drug legalization. </p>

<p> Overcrowded jails and prisons and loaded court dockets </p>

<p> indicate success, rather than failure, of law enforcement </p>

<p> in the battle against illicit drugs. Money is not being </p>

<p> wasted on law enforcement, as only 3 percent of all </p>

<p> expenditures at the Federal, State and local level involve </p>

<p> the civil and criminal justice system. A total of 1.4 </p>

<p> percent of Government spending goes toward the provision </p>

<p> of law enforcement services, and less than 1 percent of </p>

<p> the Federal budget is earmarked for law enforcement. </p>

<p> Less than 500,000 law enforcement officers are assigned to </p>

<p> protect more than 245 million American citizens, and the </p>

<p> lead antidrug agency has just 3,000 officers. </p>

<p> The IACP, in conjunction with the Justice Department, the </p>

<p> Bureau of Justice Assistance and DEA, called together law </p>

<p> enforcement authorities from all levels for five drug </p>

<p> strategy sessions in 1987. A major finding from those </p>

<p> sessions was that crime could be reduced through </p>

<p> cooperative community strategies. This information was </p>

<p> produced in manual form. </p>

<p> The United States has seen fit to protect Americans from </p>

<p> substances that may be harmful through the regulation of </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of these products. There has </p>

<p> lieen little complaint about the infringement on </p>

<p> individual rights in the process. It is understood that </p>

<p> these products-meats, milk, prescription drugs, serums and </p>

<p> vaccines-are regulated because the manufacturer alone </p>

<p> cannot be depended upon to put the interests of the </p>

<p> consumer ahead of the interests of profit. </p>

<p> Legalization is not a realistic option. At best, it is a </p>

<p> last resort when all else has truly failed. </p>

<p> WILLIAM CHAMBLISS, PH.D., PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> The drug trade was estimated at about $1 billion a year 50 </p>

<p> years ago in 1938. Today, it is valued at somewhere </p>

<p> around $130 billion, which is larger than the gross </p>

<p> national product of most nations in the world and many </p>

<p> multinational corporations, </p>

<p> Drug profits remain essential to the survival of organized </p>

<p> crime. Churning out these profits and protecting them </p>

<p> involves engendering corruption of law enforcement </p>

<p> authorities, and this remains an ongoing goal of organized </p>

<p> crime, which remains a hazard of trying to stop the flow </p>

<p> and use of drugs by criminalizing it. </p>

<p> Because of the level of poverty and other factors, it is </p>

<p> impossible to expect a complete end to the drug trade even </p>

<p> if police were able to arrest each and every drug pusher </p>

<p> tomorrow. The costs of enforcing drug laws outweighs the </p>

<p> benefits, </p>

<p> A new drug policy should first take into account that </p>

<p> marijuana should be considered separately from such </p>

<p> substances as cocaine and heroin. States that have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana have had positive experiences as </p>

<p> a result. </p>

<p> Although the experiment with prescribed heroin in Great </p>

<p> Britain has not been totally successful, it is more </p>

<p> successful than what the United States has experienced </p>

<p> with criminalized heroin. Both heroin and cocaine should </p>

<p> be legalized and dispensed by medical professionals. </p>

<p> DR. CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PH.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL </p>

<p> INSTITUTE </p>

<p> ON DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> NIDA is strongly opposed to the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> First, there are a series of questions-including the many </p>

<p> posed by Chairman Rangel-that must be answered before we </p>

<p> can even begin to consider something as complicated as </p>

<p> legalization. For example, the pharmacological effects of </p>

<p> cocaine differ so that it is impossible to consider how </p>

<p> much would be considered enough, or a legal limit. </p>

<p> Second, there appears to be an attitude readjustment </p>

<p> occurring regarding drug abuse. According to the latest </p>

<p> national high school survey on drug abuse, drugs are being </p>

<p> seen by this group as more dangerous and there is a </p>

<p> reporting of more self-abstention from illicit drug use </p>

<p> than in other recent high school surveys. </p>

<p> In the 1980 survey, 11 percent of the respondents reported </p>

<p> daily marijuana use. The 1986-87 survey indicated that </p>

<p> figure had dropped to 3.3 percent. </p>

<p> As attitudes among adults and teenagers change, so will </p>

<p> behavior. What is also needed are more good treatment </p>

<p> programs, since we know that effective treatment works. </p>

<p> DR. ARNOLD TREBACH, PH.D., FOUNDER, DRUG POLICY INSTITUTE </p>

<p> America would be better off if all drug laws were removed </p>

<p> today. Americans are at their best when they negotiate </p>

<p> settlements, and at their worst when arguments are pushed </p>

<p> to the wall. </p>

<p> It is absolutely essential that we remove laws restricting </p>

<p> use of marijuana and heroin for medicinal purposes. It is </p>

<p> also important to begin viewing drug addicts from a </p>

<p> different perspective. We should be more concerned about </p>

<p> getting them treatment rather than branding them </p>

<p> criminals. This would include some form of maintenance, </p>

<p> which is admittedly controversial. </p>

<p> There should be limited experimentation with recreational </p>

<p> drugs. The 1973 Nixon Commission on Marijuana and Drug </p>

<p> Abuse as well as the 1982 report of the National Academy </p>

<p> of Sciences suggest an attempt at limited </p>

<p> decriminalization or legalization. </p>

<p> ADM. JAMES WATKINS, U.S. NAVV (RET.), CHAIRMAN, </p>

<p> PRESIDENT'S </p>

<p> AIDS COMMISSION </p>

<p> An emerging problem stemming from rampant drug abuse is </p>

<p> that of AIDS. One of the conduits of the deadly HIV virus </p>

<p> that leads to AIDS is contact with an individual who is an </p>

<p> abuser of drugs intravenously. </p>

<p> The IV drug abusers make up only 25 percent of all AIDS </p>

<p> victims, but about 70 percent of heterosexual native </p>

<p> citizens have contracted the disease from contact with an </p>

<p> intravenous drug abuser. About 70 percent of perinatal </p>

<p> AIDS cases involve a parent who is either an IV drug </p>

<p> abuser or who has a sexual partner who abuses drugs </p>

<p> intravenously. </p>

<p> More treatment is needed for IV drug abusers. There are </p>

<p> some 1.2 million IV drug abusers in the United States, but </p>

<p> only about 148,000 are in some form of treatment at any </p>

<p> given time. </p>

<p> What is needed is a full-scale effort that addresses both </p>

<p> supply and demand. </p>

<p> During its time as functioning body, the President's AIDS </p>

<p> Commission heard testimony regarding the use of needle </p>

<p> exchange programs. The overriding opinion of many black </p>

<p> leaders who testified at an inquiry held in New York City </p>

<p> is that IV drug abuse is killing the black community. </p>

<p> However, these same leaders were opposed to needle </p>

<p> exchange programs, and view them as a copout answer to a </p>

<p> very serious problem. They are considered the first step </p>

<p> to full-fledged legalization. </p>

<p> The most important thing that can be done to lick the drug </p>

<p> problem is to help young people avoid using drugs in the </p>

<p> first place. </p>

<p> DR. TOD MIKURIYA, M.D., PSYCHIATRIST, BERKELEY, CA </p>

<p> It is good to see an increase in public awareness about </p>

<p> the dangers of alcohol and tobacco and about the </p>

<p> increasing tendency to classify them as drugs of abuse. </p>

<p> While we focus heavily on the problems of drugs like </p>

<p> cocaine and crack, very little attention has been paid to </p>

<p> the problems caused by poisoning from alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p> We need to move closer to acceptance of these substances </p>

<p> as dangerous drugs. </p>

<p> A comprehensive proposal regarding drug use in America </p>

<p> would encompass the following six points: </p>

<p> (1) The removal of product liability exemptions for </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> (2) The removal of price supports for tobacco. </p>

<p> (3) The establishment of a drug users' cooperative. </p>

<p> (4) The legalization of home cultivation of cannabis. </p>

<p> (5) The disallowance of searches of citizens' homes </p>

<p> without a warrant. </p>

<p> (6) A testing of those who test others for drug use. </p>

<p> JOHN GUSTAFSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NEW YORK DIVISION OF </p>

<p> SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES </p>

<p> Our agency oversees about 400 local treatment and </p>

<p> prevention programs, with a capacity to treat 46,000 </p>

<p> people and to provide counseling services to another </p>

<p> 17,000. </p>

<p> About 22 percent of New York's population has abused some </p>

<p> type of substance within the last 6 months. Half of this </p>

<p> number abuses drugs on a regular basis. More than 600,000 </p>

<p> people art- considered non-narcotic substance abusers and </p>

<p> about 260,000 are narcotics addicts. </p>

<p> The social and health consequences of legalization would </p>

<p> be too great. Legalization advocates are ignoring the </p>

<p> seductive properties of drugs like cocaine, which </p>

<p> laboratory tests show leave the user craving for more. </p>

<p> While alcohol Prohibition may have been a law enforcement </p>

<p> failure, it was a success healthwise. During the 1920's, </p>

<p> alcohol-related mental illness declined significantly, but </p>

<p> shot back up after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. </p>

<p> From 1917 until 1921, New York State made narcotics </p>

<p> available through clinics. But that practice was </p>

<p> discontinued after it was discovered that many people were </p>

<p> supplementing their legal supply with drugs purchased from </p>

<p> the black market. This is a lesson for those considering </p>

<p> legalization today. </p>

<p> We cannot overlook the impact that legalization would have </p>

<p> on health and health care systems. Many illicit drugs </p>

<p> lead to chronic health problems for users, and this </p>

<p> problem would be pronounced under legalization. </p>

<p> STEVEN WISOTSKY, PROFESSOR OF LAW, NOVA UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> An independent national commission should be set up to </p>

<p> take a fresh look at U.S. drug policy. Such a commission </p>

<p> should have two fundamental goals: To reduce drug abuse, </p>

<p> and to reduce the social problems stemming from the </p>

<p> existence of the black market illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> A clear definition should be reached and agreed upon in </p>

<p> terms of what &quot;the drug problem&quot; in America is. Is
it </p>

<p> drug use in general? Is it drug use by children and </p>

<p> teenagers? Is it drug use that proves to be injurious to </p>

<p> others or to the drug users themselves? Is it the black </p>

<p> market and the events associated with that market in terms </p>

<p> of crime and violence? </p>

<p> Detailed studies and polls should be conducted to </p>

<p> determine how drugs should be legalized. This should be </p>

<p> along the lines of marketing surveys done to prepare for </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of other products. </p>

<p> For example, focus groups can be set up, and groups of </p>

<p> individuals-such as prison volunteers serving life </p>

<p> sentences-can be used for tracking the effects of certain </p>

<p> drugs and also for gauging the addictive qualities of </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> Among the priorities of drug control should be the </p>

<p> protection of children, the protection of the safety and </p>

<p> health of the public and the preservation of individual </p>

<p> liberties in the process. </p>

<p> The real moral high ground in finding a Solution to the </p>

<p> drug crisis is one that will allow responsible, competent </p>

<p> adults to have the freedom of choice so long as they do </p>

<p> not intrude on the rights and privileges of others. No </p>

<p> drug control policy should affront the Constitution. </p>

<p> DR. MITCHELL ROSENTHAL, M.D., PRESIDENT, PHOENIX HOUSE, </p>

<p> NEW YORK, NY </p>

<p> Drug legalization would increase drug use and would </p>

<p> further aggravate all the destabilizing influences that </p>

<p> plague societv today. </p>

<p> Addiction to illicit drugs has an enormous impact on the </p>

<p> character, behavior and values of the abuser. While just </p>

<p> as many cigarette smokers have become dependent on that </p>

<p> product, the number of cocaine users, the power of cocaine </p>

<p> addiction and the amounts that addicts would use if it </p>

<p> were readily available and less expensive is ignored by </p>

<p> those pushing legalization. </p>

<p> Illicit drug use rapidly diminishes one's ability to lead </p>

<p> a normal, productive life. Drug abuse causes self- </p>

<p> destructive behavior, lowering the self-esteem and </p>

<p> creating the potential for violent, antisocial behavior. </p>

<p> Projections that drug use would double or even triple </p>

<p> under legalization should be taken seriously. The </p>

<p> greatest increase would come from those between the ages </p>

<p> of 12 and 21 years old. Projections of drug-related </p>

<p> deaths post-legalization range from 100,000 to 500,000. </p>

<p> The social order will suffer. Drug users are generally </p>

<p> irresponsible people whose deviant behavior ranges from </p>

<p> destroying relationships to inability to lead productive </p>

<p> work lives to crime. All of these possibilities will be </p>

<p> raised with legalized drugs. </p>

<p> We can realistically expect to overcome the drug crisis </p>

<p> with a shifting public attitude and a stronger effort to </p>

<p> enforce drug laws on the street. </p>

<p> ETHAN NADELMANN, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, PRINCETON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> Neither legalization nor decriminalization should be </p>

<p> considered a surrender. They are the policies that drug </p>

<p> dealers fear most. </p>

<p> What is legalization? It is a model of analysis. It is a </p>

<p> cost benefit analysis of current policies. We have to </p>

<p> look at our policy and costs and compare to other systems </p>

<p> and figure out which has the most benefits for the money- </p>

<p> What is the drug problem? This must be defined before </p>

<p> going further. In the 1920's, people did not talk of
&quot;the </p>

<p> alcohol problem.&quot; Instead, they separated the problem
into </p>

<p> one of crime--the Al Capone types and their influence on </p>

<p> the consumption of alcoholand into another category of </p>

<p> alcohol abuse. It was decided that Prohibition was not </p>

<p> worth the costs, even if it reduced abuse to a degree. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, today the drug problem is not separated as </p>

<p> such and &quot;the drug problem&quot; is defined as both
crime and </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> We will not be able to move forward until we make the </p>

<p> distinction as was made with alcohol in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Nearly 20 percent of all State and local resources go to </p>

<p> fighting drugs, In Washington, DC, more than half the </p>

<p> people in jail are there on drug-related charges, and the </p>

<p> figure in New York City is about 40 percent. </p>

<p> SUE RUSCHE, NATIONAL DRUG INFORMATION CENTER, FAMILIES IN </p>

<p> ACTION </p>

<p> It is important that the perspective of families be </p>

<p> included in the national debate on legalization. </p>

<p> In looking at both the alcohol and cigarette industries </p>

<p> they spent more on advertising in the previous year than </p>

<p> Congress appropriated to fight the drug crisis. We do not </p>

<p> need any more legal industries of this sort amassing large </p>

<p> profits in selling their products to our children and to </p>

<p> ourselves. </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents make the argument that </p>

<p> alcohol is legal and is not sold to young people. But </p>

<p> alcohol sales to minors are routine as sales clerks fail </p>

<p> to ask for identification or look the other way when </p>

<p> obviously underage young people make an alcohol purchase. </p>

<p> If we cannot expect the alcohol and tobacco industry to </p>

<p> prevent sales to minors, then how can we expect a cocaine </p>

<p> or opiate industry from doing the same? </p>

<p> At the very least, illicit drugs are as harmful as alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco. Fewer people die from them than from alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco because fewer people use them, and fewer </p>

<p> people use them because they are illegal. There are 18 </p>

<p> million marijuana users compared to 116 million alcohol </p>

<p> users; and there are 6 million cocaine users compared to </p>

<p> 60 million tobacco users. </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco are leading killers in the United </p>

<p> States. We do not live with alcohol and tobacco, we die </p>

<p> with them. It would take two walls like the Vietnam </p>

<p> Memorial shrine in Washington, DC to memorialize all those </p>

<p> killed by alcohol in a year. It would take 7 to 10 walls </p>

<p> to cover all those who die from tobacco. </p>

<p> Some say taxes from drugs sales could go toward treatment </p>

<p> and education, but no money from the sale of alcohol and </p>

<p> tobacco ever goes toward education and treatment for those </p>

<p> problems. </p>

<p> Legalization would not eliminate profits- They would </p>

<p> simply be shifted from the drug traffickers on the street </p>

<p> to the people who run legitimate businesses. </p>

<p> It is unreasonable to think that drug use would not </p>

<p> increase under legalization. A total of 11 States have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana. From 1972 to 1978, in those </p>

<p> States, marijuana use, as a result of the </p>

<p> decriminalization, rose 125 percent among young adults, </p>

<p> 130 percent among high school seniors, 200 percent among </p>

<p> older adults and 240 percent among teenagers. </p>

<p> We are beginning to see drug use drop off in this country. </p>

<p> We would like to see the Congress create a National Drug </p>

<p> Corps similar to the Peace Corps, where parents and </p>

<p> children could be trained to give I or 2 years of service </p>

<p> fighting drug abuse in their communities. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Friday, September 30,1988 </p>

<p> DR. DAVID F. MUSTO, M.D., DRUG HISTORIAN, YALE UNIVERSiry </p>

<p> Around the turn of the century, drugs such as cocaine, </p>

<p> heroin and morphine were legally sold and consumed in the </p>

<p> United States, Consumption of these drugs reached a peak </p>

<p> around 1890 to 1900. </p>

<p> Because of the high rate of consumption and the effects </p>

<p> these then-legal narcotics were having on individuals and </p>

<p> families, America moved toward enacting laws and controls </p>

<p> that have led to today's drug laws. </p>

<p> We are currently experiencing our second epidemic with </p>

<p> cocaine. The first occurred around the mid 1880's, when </p>

<p> this drug was made available in 14 different forms. One </p>

<p> could smoke it, rub it on in a salve, inject it, or even </p>

<p> sniff it. </p>

<p> Cocaine's image as the &quot;All-American tonic&quot; ended
around </p>

<p> 1900, when it came to be known as the most dangerous drug </p>

<p> in the country. The first congressionally passed </p>

<p> legislation regulating cocaine was in 1914, and was called </p>

<p> the Harrison Narcotics Act. </p>

<p> A key to reducing the demand for drugs will be a changing </p>

<p> of the public's attitudes. </p>

<p> Those supporting a look-see at legalization must be </p>

<p> reminded that there are many things in our society that we </p>

<p> do not attempt a look-see because we know in advance it is </p>

<p> bad and would lead to worse problems. One of them, for </p>

<p> example, is racial discrimination. We ask for laws </p>

<p> restricting it because we know it is bad. </p>

<p> Ending the drug crisis will be a very gradual thing. It </p>

<p> cannot be done in just 2 or 3 years. Drug use in America </p>

<p> peaked around 1979, and at that time there was a call for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> The argument for legalizing cocaine in the 1970's was that </p>

<p> cocaine was a harmless drug unless misused. Today, the </p>

<p> argument is that legalizing it will remove the criminal </p>

<p> influence. We now see cocaine as bad in itself, and this </p>

<p> is a tremendous attitude turnaround that can be used as a </p>

<p> foundation for a further decline in cocaine usage. </p>

<p> DR. DALE MASI, PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AND </p>

<p> COMMUNITY PLANNING, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND </p>

<p> The workplace cannot afford the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> In previous testimony before the Select Committee on </p>

<p> Narcotics Abuse and Control, my position was that there </p>

<p> was a dramatic need for an increase in industry drug </p>

<p> programs in this country. That need is greater today: </p>

<p> (1) A majority of illicit drug users are in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (2) Alcohol is the primary drug of abuse in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (3) Prescription drugs are the second largest drug of </p>

<p> abuse in the workplace. </p>

<p> (4) The most recent surveys indicate that 19- to 25-year- </p>

<p> olds are the biggest abusers of cocaine, with 25- to 30- </p>

<p> year-olds being the second largest group. If cocaine is </p>

<p> legalized, it would outdistance both alcohol and </p>

<p> prescription drugs as the most abused drug in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> Drug abuse in the workplace translates into escalating </p>

<p> health insurance bills. In addition, it contributes to </p>

<p> the problems of absenteeism, sick leave, accidents, other </p>

<p> rising health costs and more worker compensation claims. </p>

<p> More emphasis will have to be placed on companies </p>

<p> educating workers about the dangers of drug abuse, as has </p>

<p> been the case with tobacco. Few companies, a study by </p>

<p> Cook and Harrell shows, have drug education promotion </p>

<p> programs. The IBM Corp. stands out as a model for the </p>

<p> rest of the industry in the country. </p>

<p> Schools of medicine, social work and psychology today </p>

<p> rarely require that students take a course in alcohol or </p>

<p> drug addiction. Fewer schools of psychology require a </p>

<p> course in drug addiction than was the case in 1950. The </p>

<p> council on social work education, the accrediting arm for </p>

<p> such schools, does not even require that such courses be </p>

<p> taught for master's and social work candidates. </p>

<p> We need employee assistance programs that concentrate on </p>

<p> reaching employees early. New funds are needed for </p>

<p> meaningful programs, especially outpatient services. </p>

<p> DR. LAWRENCE BROWN, M.D., CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR, DEPARTMENT </p>

<p> OF MEDICINE, HARLEM HOSPITAL CENTER AND THE COLLEGE OF </p>

<p> PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS </p>

<p> Legalization advocates seem to be motivated by two </p>

<p> arguments, One is that current response to the drug crisis </p>

<p> has been shamefully inadequate. Number two, legalization </p>

<p> appears to represent a reasonable alternative to the </p>

<p> current response. </p>

<p> Our current policy on drug abuse can be addressed from two </p>

<p> angles. We can look at it either from the perspective of </p>

<p> those who use drugs, or from the perspective of the </p>

<p> consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> A most common problem of those admitted to Harlem Hospital </p>

<p> for treatment of kidney failure and in need of dialysis is </p>

<p> prior drug abuse. </p>

<p> Our approach to drug abuse as a nation is that we continue </p>

<p> to view it as a stigma, rather than the public health </p>

<p> problem that it truly is. </p>

<p> It is ridiculous that so little of the educational </p>

<p> training involves the study of drug abuse, Professional </p>

<p> and health professional schools should be encouraged to </p>

<p> try to include drug abuse studies in their curriculums. </p>

<p> Existing drug treatment facilities must be improved as </p>

<p> well. The least attractive facilities are often allocated </p>

<p> for outpatient drug treatment services. An expansion of </p>

<p> treatment capability must focus on both quality and </p>

<p> quantity. </p>

<p> The legalization debate provides the country with an </p>

<p> excellent opportunity to reassess Federal drug policy. </p>

<p> These discussions will far exceed their potential if they </p>

<p> are used to chart a bold new course in responding to </p>

<p> America's drug crisis. </p>

<p> DAVID BOAZ, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AFFAIRS, CATO </p>

<p> INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Alcohol did not cause high crime rates in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Prohibition of alcohol was the problem. With today's drug </p>

<p> crisis, it is not the drugs, but rather the prohibition of </p>

<p> these drugs that are causing problems with crime and </p>

<p> violence. </p>

<p> There are six ways in which drug laws impact negatively on </p>

<p> society: </p>

<p> (1) Drug laws drive up the price. Users are forced to </p>

<p> commit crimes to support their habits. Prohibition pushes </p>

<p> some prices as much as 100 times higher than normal. Some </p>

<p> experts say half the crime in major cities results from </p>

<p> drug prohibition and many policemen will say the same </p>

<p> thing if they were free to express themselves honestly. </p>

<p> (2) Drug laws cause corruption. The extraordinary </p>

<p> profits become an irresistible temptation to policemen. </p>

<p> (3) Buyers are forced to come in contact with criminals, </p>

<p> unlike those who purchase alcohol without the help of </p>

<p> criminal,q because it is no longer illegal. </p>

<p> (4) Intense law enforcement forces the creation of </p>

<p> stronger, more potent drugs. Crack, for example, is a </p>

<p> result of drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (5) Civil liberties are abused under drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (6) A final negative result of drug prohibition is that </p>

<p> it leads to futility. In the case of today's drug crisis, </p>

<p> the drug war simply is not working. </p>

<p> GLORIA WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), VOCATIONAL </p>

<p> REHARILITATION SPECIALIST, REHABILITATION SERVICES </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION) DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> As a rehabilitation specialist in drug and alcohol abuse, </p>

<p> it is frightening to consider what the caseload would be </p>

<p> if drugs were legalized. </p>

<p> How can anyone with any insight or perception believe that </p>

<p> legalizing drugs would be the answer to the drug crisis? </p>

<p> If the main reason to legalize drugs is to remove the </p>

<p> profit from the criminals and drug traffickers, then it is </p>

<p> also saying that the U.S. Government &quot;wants a piece of
the </p>

<p> action.&quot; Uncle Sam would become the biggest dope pusher
of </p>

<p> all time. </p>

<p> Generations of young Americans are dying from drug abuse. </p>

<p> Minds and motivation are being destroyed. Families are </p>

<p> being destroyed. America is being weakened. </p>

<p> Legalization could not be accomplished without having to </p>

<p> rely on imports. Small, drug-producing countries would </p>

<p> soon become superpowers and nations with gross national </p>

<p> products inflated by cocaine and heroin production would </p>

<p> have access to nuclear warheads. </p>

<p> Fraudulent prescriptions are already a big business in the </p>

<p> United States. </p>

<p> The future for America would be very dim under </p>

<p> legalization. Medical schools, laws schools and other </p>

<p> institutions of higher learning would not touch students </p>

<p> who use drugs, even if they were legal, because it is </p>

<p> known that drug users are a detriment to themselves. </p>

<p> Under legalization, there would not be enough hospitals to </p>

<p> take care of everybody. Doctors and nurses would be in </p>

<p> demand like never before. Long lines of dope fiends </p>

<p> waiting for a fix or a hit would replace the winos in the </p>

<p> streets. </p>

<p> Those favoring legalization are being insensitive. </p>

<p> Legalization is a further step toward the perpetuation of </p>

<p> evil influence over society, rather than a positive step </p>

<p> toward resolving some of the criminal problems in society </p>

<p> like poverty, insufficient health care, and insufficient </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> America should wage a real war against drugs, using any </p>

<p> means necessary to prevent it from entering our ports and </p>

<p> coming across our borders. </p>

<p> RICHARD KAREL, JOURNALIST </p>

<p> Across the board legalization is not the answer to the </p>

<p> drug crisis that plagues the country today. More </p>

<p> dangerous drugs should continue to be prohibited, while </p>

<p> less dangerous narcotics be made legally available. </p>

<p> During the time that America was under alcohol </p>

<p> Prohibition, Great Britain was attacking the alcohol </p>

<p> problem through a combination of higher taxes, rationing </p>

<p> and limited hours of distribution. When the Volstead Act </p>

<p> was repealed, alcohol abuse rose in the United States </p>

<p> while Great Britain had already began experiencing a </p>

<p> leveling off of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse has remained </p>

<p> relatively low since. </p>

<p> Recent Studies indicate a decrease in cirrhosis of the </p>

<p> liver in the United States despite alcohol being a legal </p>

<p> substance. With tobacco, limited restrictions and </p>

<p> education have cut sales of this product to minors. </p>

<p> Prohibition is neither necessary nor advisable for either </p>

<p> of these products. </p>

<p> The focus should be on keeping dangerous drugs like crack </p>

<p> and PCP away from children, and on preventing clinically </p>

<p> controlled drugs from being diverted. This would provide </p>

<p> a moral justification for the antidrug activities of law </p>

<p> enforcement. </p>

<p> PAUL MOORE, DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, THE SCOTT NEWMAN CENTER, </p>

<p> Los ANGELES, CA </p>

<p> The Newman Center unequivocally opposes drug legalization. </p>

<p> The more time spent debating the issue, the more </p>

<p> credibility it receives. </p>

<p> Time should be spent developing more sound policies </p>

<p> regarding treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. </p>

<p> Society seems to be hooked on hyped miracle solutions that </p>

<p> look good but would not work. </p>

<p> Drugs, drug abuse and the associated crime are all </p>

<p> symptoms of deeply rooted problems in our society. Drugs </p>

<p> did not invent poverty, broken homes, latchkey children, </p>

<p> greed or the human desire for a quick- 'ix. Drugs did not </p>

<p> contribute to the general breakdown of moral and ethical </p>

<p> values. Without drugs, these problems would not disappear </p>

<p> and with drugs they are pronounced. </p>

<p> There is a perception that the drug problem can be </p>

<p> sanitized through legalization, giving residents of </p>

<p> ghettos and barrios all they want so long as they refrain </p>

<p> from committing crimes against the rest of society. </p>

<p> The threat of legalization is that it stands to send a </p>

<p> whole new set of mixed messages to America's youth. Drugs </p>

<p> already have a glamorous image. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, the gains from national efforts </p>

<p> of the past decade-such as a decrease in consumption and a </p>

<p> change in attitude of the Nation's youth-would be lost. </p>

<p> MARVIN MILLER, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, NORML, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Drugs are a problem and they create a tremendous strain on </p>

<p> the Nation's financial resources. </p>

<p> It is commonly known that there are no funds available for </p>

<p> desperately needed educational and training programs. The </p>

<p> underground narcotics trade is being allowed to run </p>

<p> rampant and control the marketplace. It controls purity </p>

<p> as well. All iirugs are, being treated as if they are the </p>

<p> same. </p>

<p> A combined total of $10 billion is spent annually on State </p>

<p> and Federal antidrug efforts. Most of this expenditure </p>

<p> goes for enforcing marijuana possession laws. About 40 </p>

<p> percent of all drug arrests relate to marijuana. Of the </p>

<p> 40-percent figure, 9 of 10 cases involve simple </p>

<p> possession. </p>

<p> There are some 50 million marijuana smokers in the United </p>

<p> States. They are otherwise law-abiding citizens who pay </p>

<p> taxes and are productive. </p>

<p> The Nation's $10 billion antidrug budget allots only about </p>

<p> 5 percent for education programs. No money exists for </p>

<p> national education or treatment programs. </p>

<p> NORML has put together a bill to make marijuana available </p>

<p> legally as a controlled and regulated substance. </p>

<p> An administrative law judge has ruled that marijuana is </p>

<p> the most benign substance known to man. It is not </p>

<p> addictive. It does not generate violence. </p>

<p> The Nation should look at new ways to battle the drug </p>

<p> crisis. Not every drug can be legalized, yet at the same </p>

<p> time, 50 million marijuana using Americans should not be </p>

<p> branded criminals. </p>

<p> RAY WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> CONSULTANT, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Legalization is not a positive proposal. It is based on </p>

<p> what may be a false assumption, that legalization is a </p>

<p> proposal intended to reduce drug abuse. </p>

<p> Drug-related murders would not necessarily decrease as a </p>

<p> result of legalization. Drug-related murder should take </p>

<p> into account drug related death, which is less glamorous, </p>

<p> but also a tragic consequence of drug abuse. </p>

<p> Many in our society have turned to drug abuse simply </p>

<p> because they are hopeless and helpless. Drugs ease the </p>

<p> pain of their reality. Many people have lived lives much </p>

<p> worse than what the criminal justice system can mete out. </p>

<p> The Nation's Government has been duplicitous in dealing </p>

<p> with the drug crisis. While Government does not </p>

<p> officially sanction drug use, it has pushed policies that </p>

<p> contribute to it-such as the lack of antidrug education </p>

<p> and treatment centers in ghettos during the 1940's, 1950's </p>

<p> and 1960's, and the closing of the only two Federal </p>

<p> treatment centers in Lexington, KY and Texas. </p>

<p> Drugs generally have not been considered a national </p>

<p> problem so long as there was the perception that it was a </p>

<p> problem of minoritics and poor whites. Middle and upper </p>

<p> income individuals, meanwhile, generally have looked at </p>

<p> cocaine as a suitable, nonaddictive drug. </p>

<p> Now that cocaine and its negative consequences have </p>

<p> reached suburbia, it is a national problem. This is </p>

<p> duplicity. </p>

<p> Drug abuse is not the root problem. It is a very </p>

<p> destructive symptom of other maladies. </p>

<p> SENAT0R JOSEPH GALIBER, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY </p>

<p> In the last 20 years or so, little or nothing has happened </p>

<p> in terms of solving the Nation's drug crisis. </p>

<p> I introduced a bill in the State assembly earlier this </p>

<p> year to set up a commission to study legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization in the State of New York. </p>

<p> America has always been the noble experiment on freedom </p>

<p> that other nations around the world have looked to as an </p>

<p> example. But now, out of frustration, Americans are </p>

<p> beginning to espouse violations of freedoms and civil </p>

<p> liberties as the answer to this frustration. </p>

<p> Drug trafficking must be eliminated through the </p>

<p> legalization of narcotics. </p>

<p> Responsible officials are suggesting arming our police </p>

<p> with more powerful weapons. They have suggested shooting </p>

<p> down suspicious planes. They have called for a doubling </p>

<p> of agents and resources, martial law and the death penalty </p>

<p> for drug traffickers. </p>

<p> We fail to realize the coexistence of two separate </p>

<p> problems regarding the Nation's drug crisis. There is </p>

<p> drug abuse and there is drug trafficking. It is the </p>

<p> trafficking that causes shootouts, raids, deaths and </p>

<p> injuries. If all drugs were legalized right now and given </p>

<p> away free, then the traffickers would cease coming in </p>

<p> immediately. The profit would be gone. </p>

<p> Drug abuse would not be eliminated under legalization, but </p>

<p> the horrible problems associated with the drug trade would </p>

<p> be gone. </p>

<p> The questions posed by Chairman Rangel can be answered in </p>

<p> the context of the alcohol industry: </p>

<p> Question. What narcotics and drugs would be legalized? </p>

<p> Answer. All. </p>

<p> Question. Who would be allowed to buy these narcotics? </p>

<p> Would there be an age limit? </p>

<p> Answer. The same limitations as those for purchasing </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Would we sell drugs to people who just want to </p>

<p> experiment and encourage them to pick up the habit? </p>

<p> Answer. We would sell drugs in the same fashion and with </p>

<p> the same restrictions as the selling of alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Where would these drugs be sold? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same places and under the same controls as </p>

<p> alcohol, </p>

<p> Question. Where would we obtain our supply of these legal </p>

<p> drugs? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that there are manufacturers of </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Do you for one minute think the tobacco industry has not </p>

<p> put together long ago contingency plans to produce </p>

<p> marijuana cigarettes when legalization becomes a reality? </p>

<p> Question. Would private industry be allowed to </p>

<p> participate in this market? </p>

<p> Answer. Of course. In the same way as in alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. If drugs would become legal, would we allow </p>

<p> pilots, railroad workers and nuclear plant employees to </p>

<p> use them? </p>

<p> Answer. Do we permit them to use alcohol? </p>

<p> Question. If drugs were legalized, how would we back up </p>

<p> our argument with our children and youth that drugs are </p>

<p> harmful? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that we do with alcohol. </p>

<p> The Volstead Act, which made liquor illegal, created </p>

<p> violence, warfare, bloodshed, corruption, illicit dealers </p>

<p> and sellers on a sale that was unprecedented until now. </p>

<p> Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past by continuing </p>

<p> to escalate a war which is totally unnecessary. </p>

<p> ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF HON. LARRY SMITH OF FLORIDA </p>

<p> Legalization will not alleviate the drug problem. Drugs </p>

<p> such as heroin and cocaine destroy both the mind and the </p>

<p> body. The new form of cocaine known as crack or rock is </p>

<p> highly addictive. Legalizing drugs would be the same as </p>

<p> admitting that we, as a people and society, cannot control </p>

<p> our actions and prefer self-destruction. Who among us </p>

<p> wants the U.S. Government to be in the business of </p>

<p> distributing cocaine, heroin, PCP or any other killing, </p>

<p> brutalizing substance? </p>

<p> Very few people believe that legalized drugs would reduce </p>

<p> the impact of drug abuse on society. Such a proposal </p>

<p> might eliminate some of the existing criminal element </p>

<p> involved in drug trafficking, but it would not stop </p>

<p> somebo4y (whether the government, tobacco companies, or </p>

<p> pharmaceutical companies) from profiting from the human </p>

<p> misery associated with drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> If we would not legalize drugs for juveniles (and we would </p>

<p> not), a flourishing market would still exist to sell to </p>

<p> them illegally. What about crime? If we distribute or </p>

<p> make legal drugs that cloud the mind or remove </p>

<p> inhibitions, does anyone believe that there will be less </p>

<p> crime? Does anyone believe that people who are on only a </p>

<p> fixed ration of free or legal drugs will not want more and </p>

<p> that someone will sell it to them illegally? And that to </p>

<p> pay for those extra&quot; drugs the drug users will not
commit </p>

<p> crimes? </p>

<p> Congress should do everything it can to eliminate drug </p>

<p> trafficking and drug abuse. The task will not be easy, </p>

<p> but that does not mean that we cannot try to alleviate </p>

<p> this devastating problem. Legalization would be the easy </p>

<p> way out, but it would not solve the underlying problem. </p>
