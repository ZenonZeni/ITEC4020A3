<H2 ALIGN=center>Welcome to the RACI NT Branch Home page</H2>

<P><IMG SRC="/pictures/linerain.gif"><P> 


The Northern Territory Branch of RACI started life as a sub-branch of 
the Queensland Branch in 1982, but it is now a full branch, albeit the smallest
in the country. It is an extremely active branch, with a much higher 
percentage of members attending meetings than some other branches.
Many members work "out bush" at the many mines sites in the NT.
Unfortunately, we currently have no members south of Katherine. There
are area representatives in Gove, Jabiru, Pine Creek, Alice Springs
and Katherine. We would like to appoint an area representative for 
Tennant Creek.<P>

The Branch currently has the immediate Past-President (1996) of RACI
nationally, Dr Barry Noller, as its Past-President.<P>

The Branch hosted 13AC/4EC, July 9 - 14, 1995. This, a joint conference
of the Analytical and Environmental Divisions of RACI, was the first 
divisional conference to be held in the NT. Copies of the two proceedings
are available at a cost of $25 (Analytical) and $15 (Environmental) from 
Brian Salter-Duke, at the Branch address below. Further information can
be obtained by clicking on the e-mail address at the bottom of this page, 
or by phone on 089-466702.<P>
