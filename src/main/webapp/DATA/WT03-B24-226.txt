As is generally the case with new discovery platforms, genomics has sprouted a plethora of companies, each of which is tackling the problem of translating genetic information into useful drug candidates from a slightly different angle.<p>

The emphasis of these companies ranges from high throughput sequencing, to the use of large patient populations to hunt for disease markers in polygenic diseases, to the use of differential display to look at gene expression in diseased and healthy tissue.<p>

Although all the genomics companies are looking at the function of genes, Exelixis Pharmaceuticals Inc. believes the key question is what level of function researchers need to understand in order to choose optimal drug discovery targets. <p>

<center><b>Living model systems</center></b><p>

"To do that, you need to put genes in a living model system," said Sherry Reynolds, a founder and acting president and COO. "Understanding function in terms of gene expression is different than understanding how the molecule behaves in a biochemical or genetic pathway. If the end game is getting products, you want to focus your energies as soon as possible on optimal targets."<p>

The 1995 startup is focused on functional genomics, elucidating the connection between genes and disease in living model systems. The Cambridge, Mass., company uses model systems to identify critical genes in disease pathways, determine their functional relationships and select targets for therapeutic intervention.<p>

The company believes that its Drosophila and mouse model systems will provide the missing link between structural genomics -- which uses random sequencing, differential cDNA display and positional cloning to find genes -- and the discovery of optimal targets for drugs.<p>

"Just finding one mutation in one gene doesn't mean you know how to treat a clinical population," said Reynolds. "The ras (oncogene) pathway is a good example. Ras itself is not a very good therapeutic target. It's really been work in model systems, systematically mutating the genome, that has led to a better understanding of its function and how it communicates with the rest of the pathway. That will enable the choice of promising therapeutic targets."<p>

Exelixis, the Greek name for evolution, bases its approach on the premise that a thorough understanding of a disease pathway is necessary to identify critical regulatory molecules and the selection of targets for drug discovery. Because genes, gene functions and interactive genetic pathways are highly conserved across species, the company believes it will be able to use its platforms to identify targets and generate animal models of human disease.<p>

Exelixis is using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to identify key regulatory molecules for drug discovery. The Pathfinder model is useful because of its high degree of structural and functional homology with humans, and because of its amenability to rapid large-scale mutagenesis.<p>

The company puts human genes of interest into its Pathfinder Screen to create a mutated phenotype. Researchers then mutate that strain one gene at a time to look for other genes that modify the target gene -- i.e., to find other critical elements in the target gene's biochemical pathway. <p>

<center><b>The trap</center></b><p>

The screen thus reveals the genes whose full expression is crucial for the function of the pathway and encode the key regulatory proteins. Once those have been discovered, the company sets up functional assays to screen for small molecules that turn on or off elements in the pathway of interest.<p>

Exelixis's second platform is its Excel Trap. The trap is designed to selectively trap secretory and transmembrane proteins in mice. All of the major biotechnology products commercialized to date, such as the interferons and G-CSF, are members of those classes of proteins. <p>

A vector designed to trap out those proteins is inserted into mouse embryonic stem cells, and the transformed cells then are put into mice. Because the vector also contains the beta-galactosidase reporter gene, researchers can quickly see in which tissues the genes are expressed. If a particular protein looks promising, the company then can develop a mouse line for further study.<p>

The technology is licensed from the University of Edinburgh, and Exelixis is working with William Skarnes of the Centre for Genome Research at the university to enhance the technique.<p>

The two platforms also can be used interactively: genes found using the mouse technology can be put into the Drosophila model to gain further understanding of functional pathways, while genes identified using Drosophila can be used to create knockout mice.<p>

Exelixis has identified about 10 human genes, which it is putting into its Pathfinder screen in a variety of disease areas. "These genes represent a sampling of technical issues -- they are clinically relevant and demonstrate the company's capabilities," Reynolds said.<p>

Exelixis plans to collaborate with corporate partners to assess the function of known human disease genes, and to license genes from academic institutions for de novo target discovery in conjunction with its own in-house efforts. Corporate partnering, which will be one of the cornerstones of the company's business model, is a particular area of expertise for Reynolds, who played a lead role in the Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.-Hoffmann LaRoche transaction.<p>

Because its focus on functional genomics doesn't require the same infrastructure that companies need for sequencing or positional cloning, Exelixis believes it will require less capital than many other genomics companies. The company raised $4 million in its first round of funding earlier this year and is planning to raise a series B round of $5-$10 million this fall.<p>
