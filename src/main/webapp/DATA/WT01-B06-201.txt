<P><B>Do you remember during the NAFTA debates when President Clinton and
Vice President Gore said that if NAFTA was a failure we could get out of
it easily?  Well, by all accounts NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement,





















has been an abysmal failure.  At the same time, President Clinton also predicted





















that the "peso would become stronger if NAFTA passes."  In reality the Mexican





















peso has taken a bath and so has the American economy.</B>












<P><B>	Before NAFTA we had a modest trade surplus with Mexico.  NAFTA went
into effect in 1994.  During 1995 we ran a $20 billion deficit with our friends





















south of the border. This represents a loss of 460,000 American jobs.  North
of the border in Canada the problem is just as bad, another $20 billion deficit,





















another half million jobs down the tube.  While we might not have heard the
giant sucking sound that Ross Perot predicted, the silent draining of high-paying





















manufacturing  jobs is just as deadly to the American economy.   </B>












<P><B>	Even economists who predicted job gains from NAFTA are now predicting





















massive job losses. Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the International Economics





















Institute, whose predictions of job gains were embraced by the Clinton





















Administration, now has flip-flopped, predicting a net loss of 225,000





















jobs.</B>












<P><B>	The Clinton Administration boldly states that NAFTA created 340,000
"good" American jobs.  However, the government fails to broadcast the fact
that Mexican imports have cost us 800,000 good American jobs, a net loss
of nearly half a million.  By only counting job gains and not deducting job





















losses, the Administration is cooking the books:  it is like only counting





















deposits in your checking account and failing to deduct the checks written
on the account.   </B>












<P><B>	The United States Department of Labor has received 644 petitions for





















assistance from factories closed by NAFTA, one plant per day since January
1994.  Briggs and Stratton laid off 2,000 workers in Wisconsin and replaced
them with Mexican workers.  Fruit of the Loom replaced 3,200 employees. 
The not-so-Jolly Green Giant fired 1,200 Californians and replaced them with





















low-wage workers south of the border.   More than 100,000 Texas have lost
jobs due to NAFTA, driving home the fact that Ross Perot was right.</B>












<P><B>	A bipartisan group of 52 Congressmen, including 34 Democrats, introduced
a bill called the NAFTA Accountability Act, which would pave the way for





















withdrawal from NAFTA.  This bill provides for the renegotiation of the trade





















agreement if the trade deficit persists and other conditions have not been
met.  President Clinton has already backtracked on NAFTA by standing firm
against the use of Mexican trucks and drivers in California, Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas.   Among the other hidden problems with the trade agreement,
it provided that starting January 1, 1996 Mexican trucks and drivers could
enter the United States freely, even though their vehicles did not meet





















environmental, safety and health standards.  The drivers of these huge trucks
are not even required to be able to read American road signs.</B>












<P><B>	We were better off before NAFTA.  Do we ever learn from our mistakes?
 In addition to the staggering trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, NAFTA
opened our southern border to more drug trafficking.  One of the consequences
of the trade agreement at your local supermarket is a flood of tempting red
ripe tomatoes from Mexico.  Beware of these attractive produce--they are
Trojan tomatoes, tainted with the pesticide DDT.  While the United States





















prohibits the use of DDT, Mexico doesn't.   </B>












<P><B>	NAFTA undermines our living standards as well as our environmental,
safety and health laws.  The trade agreement exports good manufacturing jobs
and does very little positive for America.  Now is the time to dump NAFTA
and bring jobs back to the United States.  Let's get out before it is too





















late.</B>
