<CENTER><H2>Summary of Land Use Zones in the Temagami 
Comprehensive Planning Area</H2></CENTER><P>
There are four land use zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.  These four zones, together with provincial parks, form the basis for future land use in the Temagami area.  This fact sheet summarizes the rationale and purpose of the four land use zones and provincial parks in the area, and lists common planning elements that apply to all zones.<P><BR>


<H3>Temagami-area Land Use Zones</H3><P>

<B>Protected Areas.</B>  In Protected Areas, no commercial timber harvesting, mining or aggregate extraction will be permitted.  Land use will focus on low-intensity, non-consumptive recreation and tourism, and on the protection of significant ecological values, with allowable activities such as fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, canoeing, hiking and cross-country skiing.<P>

<B>Special Management Areas.</B>  In Special Management Areas, access will be carefully planned, and resources will be managed to ensure that significant values are protected.  Remote recreation and tourism will continue to be allowed and encouraged.  Resource extraction and related development will also be permitted, but will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  This will be accomplished through access controls and area-of-concern planning done as part of the Forest Management Planning process.  Within Special Management Areas, sub-zones have been created to permit access by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs).  Some Special Management Areas may allow timber harvesting but not mining, while others may permit mineral exploration but not timber harvesting.<P>

<B>Integrated Management Areas.</B>  In Integrated Management Areas, there will be fewer restrictions on public access for recreation and resource management/extraction activities, and both types of activities will be permitted.  Resource extraction and related development will be carefully managed in Integrated Management Areas to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values within the area.<P>

<B>Developed Areas.</B>  Developed Areas contain mainly privately-owned land, including agricultural land, but also include Crown land.  Resource extraction and related development will be permitted on Crown land within Developed Areas, but the activities will be carefully managed to ensure that they are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  Mining activity on privately-owned land is subject to the provisions of the Mining Act, and other relevant legislation.<P><BR>


<H3>Provincial Parks</H3>

There are seven provincial parks within the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area - one wilderness class park, four waterway class parks, and two recreation class parks.  Wilderness parks offer the highest level of protection of resources and other ecological values, and have more restrictions on access and use.  The activities allowed in provincial parks are governed by the Provincial Parks Act, by appropriate provincial park policies established by the Ministry of Natural Resources, and by existing and future management plans developed for each park.<P><BR>
