<P>There are two distinct issues concerning atmospheric ozone. One is about
stratospheric ozone; the thinning of the ozone layer which protects Earth's
ecology from damage by too much ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The
other concerns pollution of the air in the biosphere, with elevated concentrations
of ozone resulting from mankind's activities. Air quality standards for
ozone relate to this low-altitude issue only.

<P>Ozone is naturally present in the air we breathe and can also be generated
from photochemical reactions involving hydrocarbon vapours and oxides of
nitrogen. The concerns about ozone arise from human health effects and ecological
effects, resulting from exposure of humans and crops or other vegetation
respectively, to low but significant levels of ozone. The issues surrounding
the setting of air quality standards for ozone have been described in CONCAWE
Report No. 95/60. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom

<P>Based on a review of the existing knowledge about human and animal health
effects of ozone, coupled with the present uncertainties as to what truly
constitutes an adverse health effect, two different approaches to setting
an air quality standard are plausible at the present time. A scientifically
defensible air quality band for ozone could range from 0.12-0.20 ppm
(235-392 &#181;g/m3) as a 1-hour average to protect against the triggering
of human respiratory symptoms such as losses of lung functionality, coughing
and so forth. On the other hand, a more conservative air quality band to
protect against inflammation and the potential development of chronic lung
disease resulting from longer-term exposures at lower ozone concentrations,
could range from 0.06-0.12 ppm (117-235 &#181;g/m3) as an 8-hour
average. The higher end of these bands should protect the majority of individuals
under most conditions of exposure. The lower end of the bands will increase
the probability that more potentially sensitive sub-populations are protected
under more rigorous conditions of exposure.

<P>As the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing human and animal
health data are equivocal, arguments can be made to support both the lower
as well as the higher end of the ranges, presented above. Because ambient
levels of ozone are known to fall within these ranges at some times and
in some places, other considerations such as technical feasibility and cost
of the control measures need to be factored into human health risk management
decisions. Not doing so would risk wasting society's resources which would
be better employed on other priorities.

<P>Selecting a single air quality band to protect against ecological effects
(i.e. on vegetation) on a broad European basis cannot yet be done credibly
given the current lack of a consistent scientific effects basis. Although
it is known that ozone can produce adverse effects on vegetation, there
is not yet a clear understanding of the relationships between ozone concentration,
duration of exposure, ozone uptake by the plant, and adverse plant response.
Numerous factors which can substantially affect these relationships have
been identified but not adequately examined in the existing studies. These
factors include soil and meteorological conditions, placement of leaves
within the canopy, the mechanisms which open and close the pores on leaf
surfaces, and cellular factors.

It is also noteworthy that the scientific community has been unable to decide
upon a single acceptable form of exposure index to weight the short-term
peak exposures and the long-term exposure levels in terms of an ecological
effect. A number of indices are being evaluated for use with European and
United States crop data. One reason for the lack of consensus is that key
aspects of an effect-causing exposure regime (e.g. importance of peak concentrations,
duration of respite periods, etc.) are inadequately defined for the existing
indices. Nevertheless, there is general agreement that a mean exposure level
is not an appropriate index for modelling ozone exposure regimes which may
result in adverse effects on vegetation. Significantly different exposure
regimes can result in the same value of a mean index, and much higher short-term
exposure levels may be 'hidden' in a mean index. At present, it appears
that all indices being evaluated are data set specific, i.e. while they
may adequately correlate exposure with effect for the specific crops tested
and under the specific local conditions (soil, climate etc.), they may not
adequately correlate exposure and effect for other crops, regions, or conditions.

<P>It can be concluded that determining the significance of the ecological
effects of man-made contributions to ozone air quality at the present time
remains firmly in the realms of fundamental scientific research. Whilst
a good deal of exposure data is available for ozone, a satisfactory parameter
to express an environmental standard has not yet been devised.
