<P><BR>
<B>Activity Summary:  </B>The Growth Fund of Spain, Inc. gained 3.31%
on a net asset value basis and 3.19% in market price during October,
both in U.S. dollars.  The Spanish stock market continued to perform
well, backed by the strength of the telecommunications sector,
the banking sector and the electric utilities sector which all
continue to benefit from deregulation and a lower interest-rate
environment.  The food sector suffered the biggest losses with
the recent tax hike on cigarettes starting to affect the profit
margins of tobacco producer Tabacalera.  Going forward, the managers
do not rule out a minor correction in the near term, but they
anticipate that the effects will be short lived.
