<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Dutch Minister of Foreign
Affairs Takes Issue With DEA<br>
Briefing Paper That Slanders Dutch Dutch Policy</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 9, The Hague, The
Netherlands.&nbsp; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hans van Mierlo
criticized the United States Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) for misrepresenting the commitment of the Dutch government
to enforce drug law violations, for misrepresenting the
prevalence of cocaine consumed by the citizens of the city of
Rotterdam, and for generally misrepresenting Dutch drug policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the request of a Member of
the Dutch Parliament, Minister van Mierlo responded to a recently
released DEA briefing paper entitled, &quot;<u>How to Hold Your
Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</u>&quot; [NORML Weekly News
Release, 11/3/94): The entire letter follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;The Minister will point out to
    the American Authorities that Dutch drug policy is falsely
    represented in a manual of the American Drug Battle Agency
    [DEA --ed.].&nbsp; The manual mentions that the police in the Netherlands
    are instructed not to take action against the street trade of any
    drug.&nbsp; That is not true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In many municipalities in
    the Netherlands, the policing and prosecution of street
    traders of drugs is a high priority.&nbsp; Special cell space
    is reserved for that purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Furthermore, according to
    the DEA manual, a study of the entire Rotterdam population of
    individuals fifteen years and older showed that 3.3% of this
    population uses cocaine.&nbsp; What the research showed was that
    3.3% of the entire population of Rotterdam between fifteen to nineteen
    years old mentioned that they had used cocaine [emphasis added
    - ed.].&nbsp; It is totally irresponsible to state that all
    of these people are cocaine users and ridiculous to relate
    the figures to the total Rotterdam population. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, data in the manual
    is not all wrong, but stripped of their context and therefore
    easily misinterpreted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The mistakes made will be
    discussed with the American Authorities by the Minister of
    Foreign Affairs.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Richard Cowan, NORML National
Director, said that &quot;NORML is proud to have brought this
matter to the attention of the Dutch government.&nbsp; The
Netherlands is one of America's oldest allies.&nbsp; John Paul
Jones refitted his ships with Dutch supplies, including hemp rope
and sails, during the American Revolution and wrote movingly of the
kindness of the Dutch people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML believes that the DEA lies
about Dutch drug policy to create the impression that Dutch
tolerance of marijuana sales is a failure.&nbsp; In fact it is a
great success.&nbsp; If Americans want to see how freedom works,
they should visit the Netherlands.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Ohio's &quot;Smoke A Joint,
Lose Your License&quot; Law<br>
Found To Be Unconstitutional</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On November 29, 1994, in an
important court test of a classic unfunded federal mandate,
Medina County Municipal Court Judge Dale H. Chase ruled that
Ohio's mandated suspension of an individual's driver's license
for minor possession of marijuana is unconstitutional. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An excerpt from Judge Chase's
two-page decision follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;...suspension/revocation of the
    driver's license of an individual convicted of possession of
    drug paraphernalia is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
    to the Constitution of the United States on the basis that
    there is no 'rational relationship' between a license suspension
    for violating a drug law and the Ohio statutes dealing with legal
    operation of motor vehicles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision to suspend a
    driver's license for a violation of certain statutes which
    are not related to operation of vehicles would be no different
    than a decision to suspend an individual's vendor's license
    or other license issued by the state to conduct activities
    within the State of Ohio, to the extent that the licensing
    statute is not rationally related to the criminal statute
    involved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Accordingly, the Court
    finds... mandating license suspension for certain offenses,
    is unconstitutional.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font>

v. Frye</u>, Case No. 94 CRB 00792 or for more information

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>U.S. Anti-Drug Agencies
Continue To Impede<br>
Medical Marijuana Research</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 8, The <i>San Francisco
Examiner</i> reported that University of California-San Francisco
clinical researcher Dr. Donald Abrams' proposed medical study of marijuana's
effects on AIDS related wasting syndrome continues to be blocked
by the U.S. government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For two-and-a-half years Abrams
has struggled to get marijuana for an FDA approved study to test
whether smoking marijuana can stimulate the appetite and body weight
of people who are wasting because of AIDS.&nbsp; He has gone
through three medical committees and two regulatory agencies,
found a foreign supplier of marijuana and solicited help from the
Dutch government.&nbsp; But he and the Community Consortium on
HIV research still don't know whether they'll be able to do the
test, according to the <i>Examiner</i>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Examiner</i> article
states that ,&quot;Dr. Philip Lee, Assistant Secretary for Health [and
Human Services --ed.], has postponed two meetings to discuss the
issue of smoking marijuana to stimulate appetite in AIDS
patients.&nbsp; A meeting is expected to take place within the
next two weeks, but indications from NIDA don't look good.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Examiner</i> interviewed
&quot;a government official that confirmed what many observers
already know: <u>Agencies determined to convince the public that
marijuana is dangerous are not keen about a study that could show
some beneficial effect</u>.&quot;&nbsp; [emphasis added --ed.] </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML would add that marijuana
is already being used illegally by thousands of people with AIDS
for the wasting syndrome and chronic nausea caused by AIDS and by
FDA approved pharmaceuticals such as AZT. </font></p>
