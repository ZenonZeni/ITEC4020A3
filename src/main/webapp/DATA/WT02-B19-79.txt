<i><u>Professor B. Benhabib</u></i><p>
     Kinematic Analysis and Optimal Trajectory Planning of Multi-arm Robots:  This research
area includes activities on developing algorithmic procedures for optimal trajectory planning of
robots with multiple arms cooperating on a task for point-to-point as well as continuous path
motion control strategies.  Optimal trajectories are obtained minimizing/maximizing objective
functions such as joint displacements, velocities and accelerations, motion time, and accuracy. <p>
     On-line trajectory planning for the grasping of moving objects using visual feedback from
an active vision system. <p>

<i><u>Professor W.L. Cleghorn</u></i><p>
     Computer aided kinematic and dynamic optimization of robotic systems. 
Kinetoelastodynamics analysis of high speed flexible mechanisms. See also <A HREF="cleghorn/main.html">Research and Projects</A>.<p>

<i><u>Professor R.G. Fenton</u></i><p>
     A generalized method for solving the inverse kinematics of robots are developed using
both transformation matrices, screw displacement and the algebra of rotations.  Methods are
developed for the kinematic control of robots with redundant degrees of freedom using
optimization.  Task space trajectory planning is undertaken for robots with redundant degrees
of freedom.  Work is done on robot accuracy and repeatability determination, on performance
criteria function determination, on robot design, on joint tolerance requirement determination,
on the development of compensating algorithms to reduce static and dynamic deflections caused
errors, on task planning and optimum subtask allocation.  Robot dynamics and design. 
Applications.  Multifinger grasping. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     Modelling and control of robot/environment interaction.  Control of force, position and
impedance.  Robust control of nonlinear systems.  Algebraic theory of robot control.
Environmental uncertainty; control and experimentation. Theory of grasping and manipulation
with dexterous devices.  Kinematics of robotics.  Real-time control of robots using dynamic
models. Remote manipulation.  Design and control of adaptive grippers.  Design of dexterous
hands.  Knowledge-base reasoning for control of dexterous devices. Development of actuators
for fine manipulation. Development of automation for industrial applications. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.K. Mills</u></i><p>
     Investigations are being undertaken in the following areas: Modelling and control of
manipulators during transition to and from contact motion. Development of control strategies
for manipulators during contact task execution. <p>
     Theoretical and experimental work in the area of investigation of structural compliance
effects on manipulator performance and stability during contact tasks.  Structural compliance
effects include link, joint and contact surface flexibility. <p>
     Trajectory generation methods and strategies for contact task execution.  This area
addresses both soft and hard contact with the work environment. <p> 
     Investigation, both theoretical and experimental into dynamics and control of
coantagonistic muscle actuation methods.  <p>
     Work in the area of dynamics, stability and control of teleoperator systems is underway. 
This work is both theoretical and experimental in nature. Force control strategies for precision
insertion of components is underway from both a theoretical and experimental perspective. <p>
     Control of robot manipulators using the neural networks.  Stability, performance are
examined utilizing methods of real analysis.  Computer simulation and experiments are
conducted to verify theoretical results.  <p>

<i><u>Professor J. Van de Vegte</u></i><p>
     Design of Multivariable Feedback Control Systems.  Two approaches are considered, both
aimed at making multivariable system design more "accessible".  One is based on representation
of the dynamics by transfer function matrices, and uses only methods and tools which are
familiar from "classical" single-variable theory.  The other approach is a new nonparametric
analysis and design technique in the time domain.  Here the plant dynamics is assumed to be
available only in the form of a measured impulse or step response graph, and the desired
response is similarly specified by a step response graph. <p>
<i><u>Professor J.W. Zu</u></i><p>
Vibration control is one of the main concerns in industry.  There are two basic methods to reduce vibrations: active vibration control and passive vibration control.  To control the vibration
effectively using various methods is the main consideration in this part of research.<p>
