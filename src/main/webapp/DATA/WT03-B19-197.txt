<H2>Australia</H2>
Aviation employs 45,000 people in Australia.  Demand for air travel is picking up as world economic conditions improve. Excess capacity is gradually declining as travel demand increases and airlines achieve greater efficiencies through mergers and inter-firm agreements.
<P>
The Australian aviation industry has the potential to provide airport development, training and consultancy services in Asia where the aviation industry is expanding rapidly and infrastructure needs to be upgraded.  Industry capacity includes business, tourism, marketing and infrastructure services together with complementary service transport access to major airports, and the long-term enhancement of airport potential through appropriate planning and environmental management.

<H2>Victoria</H2>
The two major Australian airlines, Qantas and Ansett, along with other aviation activities including airport operation employ around 12,000 people in Victoria.  Melbourne is emerging as a major centre for the industry in the Asia-Pacific region.  Ansett Airlines is headquartered in Melbourne.
<P>
In 1994/95, Melbourne Airport handled 10 million domestic passengers, an increase of 12 % on the previous year, 2 million international passengers and generated a record profit of $52 million before tax and interest.
<P>
Airports at Moorabbin and Essendon provide general aviation services, while Avalon is part-owned and leased by ASTA and serves as a freight and maintenance centre and as an airport.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics forecasts the volume of Australian air traffic to grow at around 7% over the second half of the 1990s.
