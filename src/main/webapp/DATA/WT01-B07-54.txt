<H1>Two Air Flow Studies Completed<A NAME="beginning"></A></H1>

<H3>Martin Liddament reviews two recently completed air flow annexes
</H3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Ultimately, the quality of indoor air and thus the health of occupants
is dependent on the interaction and mixing behaviour of pollutants
with clean air. In addition, the heating and refrigerative cooling
of a space is exceptionally energy intensive with the result that
unnecessary or uncontrolled air flow from buildings still results
in a largely undefinable but significant proportion of total energy
loss. Only by continuing to develop measurement and calculation
techniques, and by producing practitioner tools, can energy efficient
solutions to indoor environmental problems be achieved.
<P>
In its strategy plan for 1994 to 1997, the IEA Executive Committee
for <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems
</A> (ECBCS) concluded that ventilation and air movement will
become the dominant heat and cooling loss mechanism in buildings
of the next century. Its impact on global energy use will also
increase substantially. Thus a goal was established to determine
indoor air quality and optimal ventilation needs and to identify
alternative energy efficient strategies to control the indoor
environment. In support of this, various research annexes were
established including:
<UL>
<LI>Annex 23 Multi-Zone Air Flow Modelling
<LI>Annex 26 Energy Efficient Ventilation of Large Enclosures
</UL>

<P>
These annexes have now been completed and the results were presented
at the recent Roomvent Conference held in Yokohama, Japan on 17th-19th
July 1996. A review of the outcome is summarised below.
<H2><A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex23.html" >Annex 23 Multi-Zone Air Flow Modelling (COMIS)
</A></H2>

<H3>Background and Objectives</H3>

<P>
Having its origins as a year long international workshop held
at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, the 'Conjunction
Of Multizone Infiltration Specialists' (COMIS) became adopted
as IEA Annex 23 in 1992. The Operating Agent responsible for the
development and management of this task is Dr Helmut Feustel of
the Energy and Environment Division of the LBL. Its focus was
to develop a new multi-zone (inter-room) air flow and pollutant
transport model. In support of this, the task also involved the
most comprehensive evaluation of such models ever attempted. This
activity attracted the co-operation of researchers from nine countries,
it included the intercomparison of many existing models and involved
measurements made in more than a dozen buildings and structures.
While currently not widely used, multi-zone models are invaluable
for predicting the pattern of air flow and pollutant migration
throughout an entire building. They have also been applied to
the prediction of air flow in a single enclosed space (Annex 26).
Further applications include evaluating the performance of ventilation
systems, identifying the impact on air flow and air change rate
of window or vent opening, and predicting flow rates in mechanical
or natural ventilation ducts. Additionally, they may be coupled
to thermal models to provide a much more accurate evaluation of
heat loss and temperature distribution than is possible by simply
assuming a fixed air change rate or ventilation duty cycle.
<H3>The Tasks</H3>

<P>
Tasks included:
<UL>
<LI>devising a robust algorithm incorporating the fundamental
features of interzonal air and pollutant flow.
<LI>developing a user friendly interface.
<LI>evaluating the algorithm for numerical reliability.
<LI>evaluating potential user difficulties.
<LI>comparing numerical prediction with experimental data.
</UL>

<H3>The Algorithm</H3>

<P>
COMIS is designed to solve a network of equations representing
air flow between individual rooms or zones within a building and
between the inside and outside of a building. It is modular in
concept and contains algorithms to handle many flow problems including
flow through cracks, large openings, vertical openings, ductwork
and natural and mechanical ventilation systems. It also evaluates
pollutant migration and pressure distribution. In principle, further
modules covering other aspects may be added as the need arises.
Mass air flow rates are solved for known air path distributions
and for mechanical and natural driving forces.
<H3>The User Interface</H3>

<P>
Two user interfaces have been developed to aid the input of data.
The first, 'COMERL', is DOS based and has been developed at EMPA
in Switzerland as a simple tool to complement COMIS. The second
is a totally interactive Windows based graphical interface, 'IISIBat'
which has been developed at the Centre Scientifique et Technique
du Batiment (CSTB), France. This latter version introduces considerable
transparency into the operation of COMIS and very much relieves
the user of the need to understand the COMIS program. Both interfaces
have provision for 'default' information, including data from
the AIVC's <A HREF="numdb.html" >Numerical Database</A>.<BR>

<P>

<H3>Numerical Reliability</H3>

<P>
A variety of tests were introduced to ensure that the program
contained no numerical errors and would provide the same results
irrespective of computer or operating system. This included 'User
Test 1' which was developed as part of a joint contribution by
the AIVC and LESO in Lausanne, Switzerland. This test represented
a very simple network in which all openings and driving forces
were defined and extreme parameters were set, aimed at establishing
the ability of the algorithm to converge to a consistent solution
under all possible conditions. This and other numerical tests,
which compared results with known solutions, enabled inconsistencies
and problems in the code to be quickly identified and rectified.
<H3>Evaluating Potential User Difficulties</H3>

<P>
A further test, 'User Test 2', was developed to evaluate the ability
of the user to interpret input data and apply the data to a multi-zone
model. Judgement was needed on the specification of items such
as the number and location of flow paths, leakage coefficients,
and wind pressure distribution. This approach pinpointed potential
difficulties and highlighted further explanations that were needed
in the COMIS User Guide. Results also showed that the ability
of the user was critical in securing reliable predictions.
<H3>Comparing Numerical Predictions with Experimental Data</H3>

<P>
Ultimately the performance of a model can only be judged against
its ability to compare favourably with reliably measured results.
A comprehensive measurement programme and data sensitivity analysis
was therefore undertaken. This included a mix of real buildings
and test structures, with each being used to focus on a different
aspect of multi-zone air flow. When compared against measurement
data, numerical predictions were found to be generally of the
correct magnitude, although there were sometimes significant differences
in individual results. Much still depends on the interpretation
placed on the input data by the user and there are clearly uncertainties
over assigning wind pressure and air leakage data. Extensive testing
has shown, however, that the algorithm itself is error free and
accurately solves the basic flow equations.
<H3>Outcome and Conclusions</H3>

<P>
The main development of this annex has been the production of
the COMIS model which is available in the public domain as a stand
alone 'FORTRAN' Code. This has been thoroughly evaluated using
a wide range of measurement data. Also available in the public
domain is the Swiss interactive input algorithm, COMERL. Following
further testing, the full Windows environment interface, IISIBat,
will be available as a commercial product from CSTB in France.
<P>
Effort is still needed to improve the accuracy and transparency
of input data. Nevertheless, provided the user is familiar with
the implications of input data and has a good concept of the source
and flow characteristics of openings and driving forces, the COMIS
Model is capable of making a positive contribution to ventilation
design and pollutant prediction.

<H2><A HREF="http://www.les.iet.ethz.ch/annex26/annex26.html" >Annex 26 Air Flow in Large Enclosures
</A></H2>

<H3>Background and Objectives</H3>

<P>
Large enclosed spaces are becoming a feature of modern architecture
and are evolving in response to consumer expectations. Examples
include shopping malls, atria buildings, airport terminals and
covered sports stadia. Each presents enormous design problems
in relation to heating and cooling loads, the provision of good
air quality, and protection against smoke and fire movement. Without
modern computational and measurement techniques, it is arguable
that such buildings could not be constructed to an acceptable
level of energy and environmental performance. Many spectacular
buildings have now been designed and constructed on the basis
of computational fluid dynamic analysis combined with physical
scale modelling. However, as more designers wish to follow this
route, it has become critical to ensure that these design techniques
are correctly applied. A complete understanding of the implications
of these methods is needed to avoid the risk of fundamental mistakes
or to prevent too much reliance being placed on simulated predictions.
Annex 26 was conceived to investigate the potential pitfalls and
provide design guidance on the application of measurement and
computational tools for understanding air flow patterns in large
enclosures. The Operating Agent and Co-ordinater is Dr Alfred
Moser of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH, Zurich.
Typical building sizes included in this study vary from approximately
1000 m3 to over 100,000 m3. These are essentially buildings in
which thermal effects dominate and in which the occupied zones
are small compared to the total enclosed volume.
<H3>The Tasks</H3>

<P>
Tasks included:
<UL>
<LI>developing design guidance and producing a design principles
guide
<LI>documenting and assessing analysis and prediction techniques
<LI>documenting design case studies of existing large enclosures
</UL>

<H3>The Design Principles Guide</H3>

<P>
The design principles guide provides recommendations and advice
for the planning of ventilation and air distribution systems in
large enclosures. It focuses on information specific to the needs
of such spaces, especially where this may differ from more conventional
buildings. Particular aspects cover meeting ventilation, comfort,
air quality and safety needs as well as energy implications, ventilation
strategies, design techniques, applications, commissioning and
feedback. Included in the Guide are worked examples, information
on selecting ventilation rates, and advice on design parameters
and strategy selection.
<H3>Analysis and Prediction Techniques</H3>

<P>
Measurement and calculation methods form a vital part of the design
and evaluation process. Methods are evolving rapidly and some
of the most up-to-date techniques (both elementary and complex),
as currently used by researchers and specialists, are reviewed.
The relevance of each approach within the context of the design,
construction and evaluation process is considered. Design begins
with 'macroscopic' methods based on engineering experience and
simple analytical tools. As development continues, more sophisticated
techniques are often necessary. Examples look at individual flow
element models, zonal models (where the air space of a single
room is subdivided into a relatively small number of zones or
layers), computational fluid dynamics, physical (scale) models,
ventilation efficiency evaluation and, ultimately, commissioning
and evaluation measurements.
<H3>Case Studies</H3>

<P>
To support the analytical and design guide development, a total
of twenty six case study buildings were monitored. Of these, seven
reference case study buildings were selected for detailed measurements.
These were two university auditoriums (De Montfort University,
United Kingdom, 870 m3, and Torino Polytechnic, Italy), an experimental
1/5th scale model atrium (Japan, 135 m3), two sports halls (Norway,
128,340 m3, and Germany, 2,230 m3), a factory unit (France, 8,820
m3) and a large atrium office building (Switzerland, 20 m high).
Measurements included ventilation rates, air and surface temperature
distribution, air velocity distribution and outdoor weather conditions
(e.g. temperature and wind velocity). In most cases, thermal transfer,
temperature and air flow velocity distributions were compared
with various computational fluid dynamics and other modelling
approaches.
<H3>Outcome and Results</H3>

<P>
The work of this team, both as <A HREF="http://www.les.iet.ethz.ch/annex26/annex26.html" >Annex 26
</A> and formerly <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex20.html" >Annex 20
</A>, has consistently produced simple guidance to assist in the
reliable use of computational modelling and measurement techniques.
This particular study has developed and perfected new methods
and has provided new guidance on the operational needs and applicability
of computational fluid dynamics models.
<P>
'Simple' analysis tools intended for basic engineering application
include the 'flow element' technique in which the total flow field
is predicted by analysing each element of flow, i.e. jets, plumes,
boundary layer flow etc., individually. Similarly a simplified
measurement procedure to evaluate building air leakage has been
devised, aimed at identifying the position of the neutral pressure
plane. This has been successfully applied to identify unexpected
sources of air leakage in an enclosure.
<P>
At the more complex level, the performance of computational fluid
dynamics models has been compared with measurement results. This
has demonstrated the potential to predict flow and thermal patterns,
to a reasonable degree of accuracy, especially as measured in
the well instrumented Japanese test atrium. A zonal model, in
which the space was discretised into control volumes, was also
able to give a good prediction of thermal stratification. Important
discoveries and conclusions concerning the use of computational
fluid dynamics models include:
<UL>
<LI>Conventional computational fluid dynamics approaches incorporating
k-e type turbulence representation were found to be capable of
giving reliable prediction results for temperature, air velocity
and pollutant fields.
<LI>Small changes to boundary conditions may significantly affect
the main pattern of air flow and temperature distribution. It
was therefore essential that boundary conditions were accurately
represented. The extra effort expended to obtain realistic data
is of proven value.
<LI>Radiative heat transfer is a sensitive component of energy
transport and must be incorporated in any computational fluid
dynamics analysis.
<LI>Convective heat transfer from boundaries to the air were not
reliably predicted using coarse grid systems and log law wall
functions. Results tended to be grid spacing dependent. The use
of prescribed convective heat transfer coefficients were proposed
instead, although it was acknowledged that this might not always
be easy. New wall functions for free-convection heat transfer
are now being developed by Annex 26 participants, and the application
of these functions are presently being tried out.
<LI>Slow or non-existant convergence of the solution procedure
was found in some instances. This tends to occur when flow is
dominated by free convection forces (i.e. thermal buoyancy). It
was demonstrated that this problem could be overcome by using
a 'coupled' rather than a conventional 'sequential' (SIMPLE) solver.
In addition, instability in solutions was found in an isothermal
calculation of the air jets in the sports hall in Germany. It
is believed that the physical flow exhibits low-frequency oscillations.
It is concluded that such flows may only be modelled by time-dependent
computation. A steady-state model will never converge.
