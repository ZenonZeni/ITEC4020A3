<H2>What are the implications for the food industry of genetically modified organisms ?</H2>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>





<P>The advent of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) presents several challenges to the food industry, and concern to many consumers. </P>

<P>The challenges for the industry are ultimately concerned with securing consumer acceptance and commercial advantage. Consumer acceptance will be the ultimate judge of whether GMOs have a place on the supermarket shelves. However, in order to achieve that acceptance, suppliers, manufacturers and retailers must inform themselves first about the health, safety, authenticity, quality and legal implications of using GMOs. Then they must consider how to educate consumers.</P>

<P>This education process may prove difficult, not least because there is a vociferous lobby that objects to GMOs. </P>

<P>Some people object to the idea in principle. There is a popular science-fiction myth that geneticists are meddling with nature to produce dangerous new life forms. The fact that altering, adding or deleting one gene comes nowhere close to creating a new organism is irrelevant to these objectors. It is also the case at the moment that genetic modification of farm animals has not progressed as far as it has in plants. This is partly because the gene transfer technology is more complicated in animals, and partly because commercially important genes have yet to be identified.</P>

<P>In the case of plants, some have attempted to address public concerns by arguing that genetic engineering is nothing more than a sophisticated form of the cross pollination science that has been practiced for years. However, this is an over simplification. </P>

<P>There are two basic methods of inserting genes into a recipient plant tissue. One involves use of a bacterium (Agrobacterium) that naturally infects many dicotyledonous plants. The other involves bombarding cell nuclei with tiny gold or tungsten particles coated with genetic material. The bombardment technique is necessary for inserting genes into cereal crop tissues, since these are not infected by Agrobacterium. </P>

<P>In both techniques only some of the cells in a tissue are transformed and these have to be selected out from the mass. This is achieved by inserting a second gene at the same time as the first. The second gene codes for a protein that confers resistance to a chemical which is toxic to the untransformed cells. When this chemical - usually an antibiotic or herbicide - is added, the untransformed cells are killed, leaving the transformed cells behind and available for growth into new plants. </P>

<P>A third gene is also usually included in the DNA used for transformation. This will encode for a protein which can be assayed readily to confirm that transformation has occurred. </P>

<P>It is the use of the second marker gene that raises objections to GMOs amongst more informed objectors. It is argued that this gene could cross from the GMO to other plant species by natural means. The benefit of having a crop with some quality or processing improvement would be neglible against the downside of creating a strain of herbicide resistant &#39;superweeds&#39;. </P>

<P>A further concern about GMOs is that almost by definition, the long term health impact of consumption is not known. There are fears that the &#39;foreign&#39; genes could bring problems as well as benefits. The most cited example is that of a soybean containing genetic material from a Brazil nut, which caused allergies in individuals who consumed the soya made from the beans. In this case the soya product was withdrawn voluntarily from sale. </P>

<P>This example may prove exceptional, but is interesting from a number of perspectives. </P>

<P>First, it shows that gene transfer can confer unwanted characteristics as well as desirable ones. How many of these characteristics will have long term or indeed short term health implications will only be determined after the event. However it is likely that the media and consumers will be on the look out for risks associated with GMOs and the first sign of problems could spell disaster for a given GMO. </P>

<P>Second, it raises a specific concern about genetic modification of soy beans. Since soya products are amongst the most widely used food ingredients, genetically modified soybean could find its way into many, many food products. </P>

<P>This begs the question of whether legislation is required to ensure that foods containing GMOs are labelled as such. Currently, labelling is voluntary. The soybean/Brazil nut case suggests there is a case for declaring the source of transferred genes, as well as the recipient plant. Such labelling would impose massive administrative burdens on food manufacturers in setting up complex traceability systems, but these might prove unavoidable if the health of a minority of consumers is to be protected. </P>

<P>The labelling issue has been thrown into focus by Monsanto&#39;s recent introduction of a genetically modified soybean which has resistance to the company's own herbicide product. The company plans to mix the new bean with existing varieties without labelling the mixture. Industry groups are divided on the issue. The British Retail Consortium has expressed the view that the two types of soybean should be kept separate, whereas the Food and Drink Federation has stated that separation is &#39;impractical&#39;, &#39;unnecessary&#39; and &#39;unenforceable&#39;.</P>

<P>Retailers in general have taken the view that foods containing GMOs should be labelled as such in order to inform consumers. However, Monsanto&#39;s policy will make it impossible for the retailers to give this information. They will either have to source supplies that contain no GMOs, or adopt a labelling policy that takes account of the possibility that products contain ingredients sourced from GMOs.</P>

<P>The first option raises the issue of authenticity. It may never be possible to state categorically that a given food product contains no GMOs. Even with the best intentions, it is conceivable that some traders may deal in products derived from a GMO source without declaring it to their own customers. It is likely that tests, perhaps based on detection of the marker gene proteins, will have to be developed in much the same way that authenticity tests are required for fruit juices etc.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most insidious aspect of the development of GMOs is the extent to which a few very powerful biotechnology companies might be in a position to exploit the international food industry. For example, if a genetically modified crop is so superior to the alternatives, commercial necessity may force the GMO variety to be grown. The company that holds the &#39;plant variety right&#39; in the GMO stands to make significant gains from its use. It is interesting to speculate on the extent to which that company would also be liable for damages if there were health problems arising from use of one of its GMOs.</P>

<P>It is undoubtedly the case that GMOs have great potential benefit. A growing world population depends on sustainable food resources. Crops that are better able to resist disease, to survive drought, or remain wholesome during transportation have clear benefits. Much of the plant breeding technology that has been practiced for centuries has been directed at producing these better crops. The new technology of genetic engineering offers the potential to tailor make produce with even greater refinement. Crops can be developed to have better flavours, easier processing characteristics, stronger colours etc. Whether consumers are prepared to accept an uncertain level of risk in order to receive these relatively modest gains remains to be seen.
