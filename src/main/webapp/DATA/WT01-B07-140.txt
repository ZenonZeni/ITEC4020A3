COMMITMENT TO FALKLANDS-MALVINAS IN XMAS MESSAGE</strong> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><img src="images/london1.gif"

face="Arial"><strong>PORT STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> In a special
Xmas message broadcast by the BBC directly from London to the
islands, British Prime Minister John Major said that Britain's
commitment to the Falklanders has not diminished in any way.
&quot;<em>Our developing relationship with Argentina will not be
at the expense of Britain's unchanging commitment to the Falkland
Islands</em>&quot;, said Major following a tradition started by
his predecessor Margaret Thatcher in 1982, six months after the
end of the South Atlantic conflict, when the first Xmas message
to the islands was broadcasted. Major said that Britain continues
to seek a stable and productive relationship with Argentina, not
just because of the interests both countries have in common,
&quot;<em>but because as you have repeatedly told us, it's in
your interest too, as the progress on oil exploration has vividly
shown us</em>&quot;. &quot;<em>You have the right to live under
the flag of your choice , and we shall continue to ensure that
you enjoy that right, and that you enjoy security</em>&quot;,
underlined the Prime Minister. The remarks come as rumours of a
massive reduction in the current British troop levels in the
Falklands-Malvinas are being circulated and just a few days
before the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo begins a short
visit to the islands. Major also talked about the opportunities
and challenges that the prospects of commercially exploitable oil
reserves being discovered in the islands could bring. &quot;<em>Some
of you I know are nervous about the implications for your
environment and your traditional way of life and I understand
those fears. We've had to face in many ways similar challenges,
but I believe they can be surmounted</em>&quot;. Finally the
British Prime Minister also talked about a long term fisheries
agreement with Argentina. The fishing industry, particularly
squid licenses, remains the islands main income. &quot;<em>I know
how important fishing remains to your prosperity. It seems to me
that one of the priorities 1997 should be to make progress on an
agreement with Argentina to assure the fish stocks of the South
West Atlantic</em>&quot;. </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> As has been
tradition since she left power, the former British Prime Minister
and now Baroness Thatcher also sent her personal Xmas greetings
to the Falklanders, this time congratulating the islanders for
their British loyalty. With very emotive words, appealing to
memories of the past during the 1982 conflict, Baroness Thatcher
told the islanders how close to the Falklands-Malvinas her heart
and mind remain, and with particular admiration for the United
States, -&quot;<em>the only nation truly founded on freedom-</em>&quot;,
remembered &quot;<em>how very important Casper Weinberger (the
then US Secretary of Defence) with his assistance, had been at
that time</em>&quot;. Baroness Thatcher went on to say how glad
she felt when reading, in the FI Newsletter (the islands lobby
publication in London), the official policy of the islands:
&quot;<em>The Falklands-Malvinas are British and will continue to
be British. Any alteration is something which is to be entirely
self-determined by the people of the islands</em>&quot;. But the
former Prime Minister who recovered the islands in 1982, also
reminded the Falklanders that &quot;<em>we must never take for
granted the bravery and generosity of America not the heroism and
service of those to whose sacrifice and sense of duty we will be
eternally in deb</em>t&quot;. </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).-</strong> For the fourth year
in succession Argentine Foreign Secretary Guido Di Tella has sent
a Xmas gift to the islanders: this year 600 copies of the short
allegory &quot;<em>The Little Prince&quot;</em>, written and
illustrated by French author Antoine de Saint-Expury. In the
accompanying letter addressed &quot;<em>my dear neighbour</em>&quot;,
Di Tella explains why he picked this particular book: &quot;<em>a
delightful little book that the author says it was written for
grown ups full of imagination and dreams, who were children not
so long ago</em>&quot; Last year Di Tella sent a photograph of
his many grandchildren, several of whom he maintained were &quot;<em>foreigners</em>&quot;
because of their European background. In Xmas 1994 the gift was a
video cassette of the popular BBC series &quot;<em>Pingu the
Penguin</em>&quot;, while previously he had sent a coloured
postcard of Buenos Aires. Reaction in the islands to Di Tella's
charm policy as usual, was of indifference or regretful that
Argentine tax payers money was not used for a better purpose.
&quot;<em>This is a pointless exercise by an eccentric man</em>&quot;,
said Councilor John Birmingham. </font></p>

JOINT COOPERATION AREA</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY (MP).-</strong> British and
Argentine representatives are working at full speed to ensure
that seismic surveying in the joint co-operation area can get
started by next February and the oil exploration licensing round
at the end of 1997. The 18.000 square kilometres special joint
co-operation area in the South Atlantic, (where Argentine and
Falklands-Malvinas waters overlap), was created in the 1995 New
York oil agreement between Prime Minister Major and President
Menem. Phyllis Rendell Director of the Oil Department of the
Falklands-Malvinas just back from a meeting of the South Atlantic
Hydrocarbons Committee (SAHC), held in London, said that the
basic idea behind the co-operation is that levels and standards
for the oil industry are made extensive to the whole South
Atlantic. <em>&quot;We will encourage companies working on our
waters to participate in activities in the special co-operation
area</em>&quot;, underlined Mrs. Rendell. Mrs. Rendell said that
the SAHC is drafting proposals to ensure that both governments
equally share income generated in the special area and has also
received several proposals to outline the trenches. &quot;<em>Two
seismic companies are already interested in operating which we
expect could begin next February, and by the end of '97 the oil
licensing round should be launched</em>&quot;, remarked Mrs.
Rendell. But in spite of the overall optimism and the 1998
timetable agreed during the SAHC meeting, Mrs. Rendell warned
that there is an enormous work load ahead since the Argentine and
British licensing systems are so radically different. Experts of
the SAHC are scheduled to meet again next March in Buenos Aires.</font></p>

VISIT THE ISLANDS</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).-</strong> A small
team of journalists from Buenos Aires will be joining the two
Argentine groups of next of kin relatives when they travel to the
islands to visit the war cemetery in Darwin in mid January and
February. The announcement was made public by a member of the
local Legislative Council after &quot;<em>receiving a request</em>&quot;
from the Argentine government. The group of journalists will
include a news editor from the Buenos Aires Herald, a television
team from &quot;<em>Multimedia America</em>&quot; and a reporter
from TELAM, the official Argentine news agency. The first visit
of this kind to the war cemetery in Darwin where 234 Argentines
are buried took place in March 1991. On this occasion the
Argentines will be staying overnight at the Darwin lodge. </font></p>

TO FRICTIONS WITH BRITISH PRESS</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).-</strong> Oil has
yet to be found and in commercially sustainable volumes, but
controversy has already taken off. First it was Tony Lloyd,
Labour MP and shadow spokesman for the area who after a short
visit suggested that the islands would have to pass on to the
British Treasury some of the enormous revenue expected from the
coming oil bonanza. This was followed by reports from British
journalists, guests of the islands' government, who indicated the
possibility of a 1,1 billion pounds oil revenue in twenty years
time, and wondered what could this mean for the personality and
unique life style of the Falklanders. The Times went further and
in an editorial reminded the islanders that &quot;<em>citizens
have as many obligations as rights, the main of which is to pay
taxes according to their means</em>&quot;. Although a colony
islanders are full British citizens. The Falklands-Malvinas
government, in spite of the recent optimism about oil, has tried
to down play the controversy by arguing that it's not possible to
pretend a fixed rate, &quot;<em>when we still don't know how much
we will be receiving</em>&quot;. Councillors on the other hand
confirmed in a release that &quot;<em>it was on their own
initiative that they wrote a letter two years ago to the British
government offering to defray the cost of the defence of the
Falkland Islands should a sufficient quantity of oil be found</em>&quot;. </font></p>
