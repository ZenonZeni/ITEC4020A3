<h2>PHASE I WORK SCOPE AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS REPORT</h2>
<p>
During Phase I, a cost-shared technical and business feasibility study 
will be performed.  The performance of this study will result in the 
development of information necessary for possible follow-on work in 
Phases II through IV.  Information to be developed will include items 
such as:  a detailed description of the proposed integrated system 
including status of the individual component technologies; technology 
development requirements; anticipated market for the technology/system; 
energy efficiency compared to conventional technology; environmental 
impacts; economic performance; regulation, safety, and reliability 
issues; capabilities, experience, and commitment of the applicant for 
possible follow-on work; and a business plan.
<p>
Phase I awardees will be required to prepare a detailed Technical 
Progress Report.  The Report must address all topics in the general 
report outline included as Item 3 of the Solicitation Attachments. Other 
information and sections may be added to the Report, as deemed 
appropriate by each awardee. There is no page limit for the Report.  The 
Technical Progress Report is due to DOE by no later than the last day of 
the Phase I budget period.
<p>
In addition, a business plan shall be developed during Phase I using one 
of the commercially-available computer software packages designed for 
this purpose.  Acceptable computer software packages include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
<p>
<dl>1.   BizPlan Builder, by JIAN, $90 approximate cost;</dl>
<dl>2.   Business Plan Pro, by Palo Alto Software, $80 approximate 
cost;</dl>
<dl>3.   Business Plan, Success, Inc., by Dynamic Pathways Co., $80 
approximate cost;</dl>
<dl> 4.   Business Plan Writer, Graphite Software, $70 approximate 
cost;</dl>
<p>
In all responses to this solicitation, one of the above computer software 
packages (or an equivalent package) shall be proposed as a tool to be 
used in the development of a business plan.  The cost of the software 
package may be included in the project budget to be cost-shared by DOE 
and the applicant.  At the conclusion of Phase I, the Technical Progress 
Report must include a description of the software package, the 
methodology used for the business plan development with the package, and 
a detailed description and evaluation of the results.
<p>
The following summarizes the general types of work envisioned by DOE for 
each of four project phases.  However, in the Technical Progress Report 
provided to DOE at the conclusion of Phase I, awardees may recommend 
deviations from the suggested progression of Phases II through IV if the 
proposed integrated hydrogen system work warrants a different 
progression.  The proposed work must not include any duplication of 
efforts with ongoing DOE programs.
<p>
<H3>Phase I - Technical and Business Feasibility Study</H3><p>
<dl>As described above, Phase I involves the investigation of business 
and technical
        feasibility of the ultimate commercialization of integrated 
hydrogen systems, both for
        near-term 'niche' markets and for long-term energy markets.  
Phase I is intended to
        result in the development of information for DOE to evaluate and, 
as a result, select
        awardees for participation in Phases II through IV.</dl>
<p>
<H3> Phase II - Technology Development</H3><p>
 <dl>Phase II will involve any required research and development of one 
or more
        component or sub-system technology elements which will eventually 
be used in the
        integrated hydrogen system. </dl>
<p>
<H3> Phase III - Technology Validation</H3><p>        
<dl>Phase III will address the integration of the component or sub-system 
technology
        elements (usually two or more, such as production and storage; 
storage and
        utilization; etc.) which will be required for the commercial 
system.  The Phase III
        efforts may involve small-scale demonstrations or laboratory 
experimentation to
        validate the technologies. </dl>
<p>
 <H3>Phase IV - Demonstration of Scale-Up</H3><p>
 <dl> Phase IV will address the technical and economic issues associated 
with scale-up of
        the complete, integrated hydrogen system.  Phase IV may involve a 
pilot-scale
        demonstration of the integrated system.  A commercial-scale 
system would be the
        follow-on step performed by the awardee subsequent to Phase IV. 
</dl>
<p>
At the conclusion of Phase I, selected awardees for Phases II through IV 
may each be funded by DOE for up to five additional years.  During Phases 
II through IV, research and development activities will be cost-shared by 
the awardee at a minimum level of 20%, with a 50% minimum cost share if 
the activities involve demonstration or commercialization activities.
<p>
All Phase I awardees will be required to participate in the annual DOE 
Hydrogen Program review meeting (the next meeting should be held in April 
or May).  During this meeting, each awardee will be required to present 
their project rationale and results to-date for an evaluation by a peer 
review panel.  The results of this peer review will be one factor used by 
DOE in selecting projects to be continued into Phases II through IV.
