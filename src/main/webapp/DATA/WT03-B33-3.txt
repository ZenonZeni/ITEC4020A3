HIGH-DENSITY CD-ROM

3M ANNOUNCES DUAL-LAYER CONSTRUCTION PROCESS FOR

LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- November 14, 1994 -- 3M announced today at the
COMDEX show an advanced disc construction allowing the capacity
of high density CD-ROM discs to be doubled for play-back in next
generation CD-ROM drives.

Developed in cooperation with Philips and Sony, 3M's new disc
construction employs a second information layer to double the
capacity of the new high-density CD system under development. The
result is a ten-fold increase in capacity over today's CD-ROM
discs, or more than 6 Gigabytes of information on a single-sided
disc.

"By forming two separate information layers in a single, solid
substrate, there is no need for bonding agents to adhere multiple
platters together with air gaps between which might collect dust
particles," said Rusty Rosenberger, business development manager,
3M Software Media and CD-ROM Services. "3M's new dual-layer
process essentially provides the benefits of blue laser
technology today by doubling the capacity of the new high-density
CD-ROM disc, which is based on red laser technology," he
explained.

This new CD technology is ideally suited for the distribution of
large database and graphic image files such as medical and legal
reference databases, radiography images, digital photography, and
engineering drawing worksets. In the consumer markets, this
technology provides increased content storage and presentation
capabilities to developers of multimedia titles.
