HEALTH CARE CONTRACTOR
PAYS $700,000 TO SETTLE
QUI TAM ALLEGATIONS

     An Ohio health care contractor and its three owners will pay
the U.S. government $700,000 to settle a San Antonio businessman's
qui tam allegations that they falsified information regarding the
company's size to obtain small business set-aside contracts from
the federal government.  United States ex rel. Reed v. Sterling
Medical Associates, Inc., No. SA-92-CA-0835 (WD TX).

     The settlement, approved Nov. 17 by the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Texas, is the first qui tam suit to be
made public in the San Antonio division.

     Relator M.W. Reed's company, Med National Inc., often competed
with Sterling Medical Associates in the late 1980s for contracts to
supply radiologists for military health care operations.  Sterling
consistently underbid Med National, and Reed, suspecting Sterling
of gaining an unfair advantage, investigated the company's
practices.

     Reed filed his qui tam action in U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Texas, alleging that Sterling falsely certified
that it was a small business in bids for 11 government contracts
with the Army, Navy and Air Force totalling $5.5 million.  Reed
alleged that from 1986 to 1989, Sterling's revenues were higher
than the $3.5 million limit entitling companies to bid as a small
business.  Government regulations give small business priority in
contract procurement.

     The defendants denied liability for the allegations, stating
that it would have cost them more to litigate the case.  Reed will
receive 20%, or $140,000, of the settlement amount.

     Representing M.W. Reed was solo practitioner Glenn
Grossenbacher; and Rand Riklin and John E. Clark of Goode, Casseb
& Jones, P.C. in San Antonio.

9TH CIR. GRANTS HUGHES
STAY OF ISSUANCE IN
QUI TAM ACTION

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Nov. 29 granted Hughes
Aircraft Co.'s motion to stay issuance of mandate pending its
petition to the U.S. Supreme Court that challenges the panel's
denial of its motion for summary judgment regarding qui tam
allegations that Hughes misappropriated the technology costs of
fighter jet contracts to various subcontractors.  Schumer v. Hughes
Aircraft Co., Nos. 92-55759 and 92-55857 (9th Cir.);  see
Government Contract LR, Dec. 21, 1995.

     The panel granted the stay after denying Hughes' petition for
rehearing on Nov. 17.

     Relator William J. Schumer, a former Hughes manager, filed a
qui tam complaint in U.S. District Court for the Central District
of California, alleging that Hughes mischarged expenditures to the
B-2 bomber program that should have been charged to the F-15
fighter jet program.  After finding that the government and the
programs' subcontractors were previously made aware of the
allocations by an audit, the district court granted Hughes' motion
for summary judgment.

     The Ninth Circuit on Aug. 22 upheld the lower court's
determination that Hughes did not defraud the government.  However,
it reversed the grant of summary judgment, finding a genuine issue
of material fact regarding the allegations that Hughes entered into
unauthorized commonality agreements.

     In its petition for rehearing, Hughes asserted that the Ninth
Circuit erred in holding that government audits do not constitute
public disclosure and that Schumer's suit is valid under the False
Claims Act.  Hughes argued that government contractor employees are
not included in a "closed loop of secrecy," because there "is no
aspect of secrecy in defense procurement that would require keeping
illegal conduct secret."

     Arguing for Hughes is James J. Gallagher, Fred D. Heather,
Mark R. Troy and Barbara J. Bacon of McKenna & Cuneo, L.L.P., Los
Angeles.

DC JUDGE WILL NOT DISMISS
HBI CASE; ALLOWS
AMENDED COMPLAINT

     A District of Columbia federal judge refused on Nov. 8 to
dismiss a lawsuit against contractor Healthy Buildings
International (HBI) charging that it falsified reports of
inspections of the level of environmental tobacco smoke in federal
buildings.  United States ex rel. Seckler v. Healthy Buildings
International.

     Ruling from the bench, Judge William B. Bryant of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia lifted a stay on
discovery and allowed relator Jeffrey Seckler, a former employee of
HBI, to file an amended complaint.

     Seckler alleged in his qui tam complaint that between 1986 and
1992, HBI fraudulently conducted inspections of federal buildings
and submitted inspection reports that were fraudulent and false.
Seckler charged that HBI has a secret contractual relationship with
The Tobacco Institute (TI), a trade association funded by leading
tobacco companies, "to provide inspection reports that would not
focus on the harms caused by cigarettes, to reduce and adjust the
data from tests, ...to show reduced levels of and less harmful
effects from smoking, and to testify against smoking bans."

     In return, Seckler said, TI and the tobacco interests paid HBI
a fee for each inspection, provided HBI other fees and subsidies,
and "under the guise of grants [from Philip Morris, through TI],"
provided "hundreds of thousand of dollars to publish Healthy
Buildings International Magazine, which TI and Philip Morris
used...to combat the anti-smoking movement."

     The complaint also alleges that TI told HBI employees to lie
about their motivation for testifying and that HBI employees were
paid to spy on anti-smoking individuals and groups.  Additionally,
the complaint asserts, TI secretly reviewed many of HBI's speeches
and releases and conspired with tobacco companies to funnel money
to HBI in return for favorable inspections or testimony.

     "Despite the fact that by the mid-to-late 1980s HBI was
virtually a front for the tobacco interests, defendant HBI never
disclosed its relationship and agreements...to the United States
when it contracted to do the inspections..., leading the United
States to believe HBI's inspections would be impartial, fair,
honest and unbiased, which HBI knew in advance they would not and
could not be," the complaint states.

     According to the complaint, HBI routinely altered inspection
tests to reduce the impact of smoking but never disclosed this
practice to the United States.  Meanwhile, the complaint said, HBI
boasted of its contract with the government in promotional
materials and used the existing government contracts to obtain
further business with other federal and state agencies.

     Seckler said that HBI employees were told that any air
pollution problems could be alleviated by installing better
ventilation and that the employees were never to suggest that
smoking be banned or restricted.  Seckler also maintained that he
was instructed to lie about his identity when testifying against
smoking bans.

     Seckler said he was dismissed by HBI in September 1991,
allegedly because of poor productivity and expense account
irregularities.

     The plaintiff contends that the contracts signed by the United
States and HBI were false and fraudulent and seek relief under the
False Claims Act.  The lawsuit seeks restitution, treble damages
and costs.

     Seckler is represented by Alexander J. Pires Jr. of Conlon,
Frantz, Phelan, Knapp & Pires of Washington, DC.

CA HIGH CT. REFUSES TO
HEAR WRONGFUL DISCHARGE
SUIT AGAINST HUGHES

     The California Supreme Court Dec. 4 refused to review a
petition filed by a former in-house attorney of Hughes Aircraft Co.
challenging a Superior Court determination that the attorney was
not constructively discharged after refusing to accept a demotion,
because he failed to prove that Hughes created intolerable working
conditions.  Karambelas v. Hughes Aircraft Co., No. S050046 (CA
Sup. Ct.).

     The demotion stemmed from the attorney's supervision of a $45
million patent infringement settlement between Hughes and Ford
Motor Co., which later caused Hughes to release its claims against
the government in a separate suit worth $270 million.

     Petitioner Anthony W. Karambelas was employed by Hughes as the
assistant general counsel in charge of patents and licensing.  He
oversaw the company's patent litigation and was the main contact
with outside counsel representing Hughes in various suits.

     Hughes was the plaintiff in two 1987 patent infringement suits
involving the "Williams patent," named for the Hughes employee who
invented a satellite orbiting device.  One defendant, Ford Motor
Co., was accused of infringing upon Hughes' rights in the Williams
patent.  The U.S. government was sued in the other action for its
purchase and use of satellites infringing the Williams patent,
which included 13 Ford satellites.  Latham & Watkins represented
Hughes in the Ford case, and other outside lawyers represented
Hughes in the government case.  Ford settled the case in August
1987 for $45 million.

     Several drafts of the settlement documents prepared by Latham
& Watkins and reviewed by Karambelas contained a release of all
patent infringement claims against Ford.  Karambelas testified that
although he thought the release's language was "very broad," he
never imagined that it would "operate as a release of Hughes'
claims against the government."  The documents were signed in
September 1987.

     The government learned of the Ford settlement, and moved for
partial summary judgment on the ground that Hughes relinquished its
Williams patent infringement claims.  The U.S. Court of Federal
Claims granted the motion.  Hughes retained counsel to investigate
the handling of the settlement, which concluded that Karambelas and
Latham & Watkins negligently released Hughes' claims against the
government.  Upon its counsel's advice, Hughes did not sue Latham
& Watkins for legal malpractice.

     In May 1989, Hughes' general counsel notified Karambelas that
he was being demoted from assistant general counsel to patent
counsel due to his handling of the Ford settlement, his
"administrative failings," and his inability to work with fellow
lawyers.

     Karambelas did not accept the demotion, and was told by Hughes
that his only other choice was to resign.  Karambelas did not
return to Hughes after May 22.  He refused to sign a release and
held out for a "more appropriate" severance package.  Hughes
refused to increase the package, and notified Karambelas that he
had been "terminated for cause."

     Karambelas filed suit against the company in Los Angeles
County Superior Court, alleging wrongful termination, defamation,
invasion of privacy and blacklisting based on newspaper articles
describing the Ford settlement as a "major legal blunder" and
Karambelas as a "macho style" manager who left behind
administrative problems.  Hughes moved for summary judgment, or
summary adjudication of issues, asserting that Karambelas quit and
was not fired, that his demotion was not a constructive discharge,"
and that Hughes did not provide the newspaper article information.

     Hughes was granted summary judgment on the ground that
Karambelas quit and that Hughes did not provide information to the
press regarding the settlement or his performance at Hughes.
     Karambelas appealed to the California Court of Appeal,
contending that there were disputed facts regarding his termination
and that the trial court "seriously misapprehended its function in
ruling on a summary judgment motion."  The state high court panel
disagreed and denied review.

     The panel noted that the facts regarding Karambelas' departure
from Hughes are "irrelevant."  "What matters is his conduct
(expressly refusing to accept the demotion and telling his
coworkers he was leaving) and his own admissions at his
deposition," the panel held.  "It follows that the facts were
undisputed and that the trial court properly found that Karambelas
quit."

     The panel also rejected Karambelas' assertions that, if he
quit, it was a constructive discharge and triable issues of
material fact existed regarding that issue.  Citing to Turner v.
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1251, the panel found
Karambelas failed to prove that Hughes "intentionally created or
knowingly permitted" intolerable working conditions compelling him
to resign.

     "Demotion, even if unfair or outrageous, does not by itself
create the sort of 'intolerable' working condition that is required
to establish constructive discharge, and a claim based upon a
demotion must be supported by evidence of something more, such as
harassment," the panel held.

     In addition, the panel rejected Karambelas' claim that there
were triable issues of fact regarding his defamation, invasion of
privacy and blacklisting claims.  The panel found Hughes met its
burden of showing that it did not furnish the press with
information and, thus, showed that Karambelas' claims were
meritless.

     Arguing for Karambelas was solo practitioner Gary D. Stabile
of Manhattan Beach, CA.  Arguing for Hughes were Paul Grossman, J.
Al Latham Jr. and George W. Abele of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker in Los Angeles.

8TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS
ED MI DISMISSAL OF
ENGINEER'S BIVENS CLAIM

     A Missouri federal district court properly dismissed a former
civilian Army engineer's Bivens claim that the Army fired him
because he publicly disclosed allegations that the Army was
covering up reliability problems and providing second-rate
equipment to soldiers during the Gulf War, the Eighth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals held Dec. 21.  Weber v. Buhrkuhl et al., No. 95-
2554 (8th Cir.).

     The circuit court held that the plaintiff's allegations were
barred by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and the
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA).

     During the Gulf War, civilian Army engineer Calvin J. Weber
told various news organizations and U.S. legislators that the Army
was covering up reliability problems and not providing the best
equipment available to soldiers.  The Army terminated Weber in
June 1993.

     Weber filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri, alleging a violation of his First Amendment
right to free speech and seeking compensation under Bivens v. Six
Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388
(1971), in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs
were entitled to monetary damages because their Fourth Amendment
right against unreasonable search and seizure was violated by
federal agents acting under color of authority.

     Weber maintained that his free speech and due process rights
were violated when federal officials allegedly made false
statements and perjured themselves when Weber appealed the
revocation of his security clearance and his termination.  The
district court granted the Army's motion to dismiss for failure to
state a claim, holding that Weber's allegations were conclusory and
that his due process rights were not violated when his security
clearance was taken away, because he had no right to clearance in
the first place.

     Weber appealed, and in a three-page opinion, the Eighth
Circuit upheld the lower court's findings, noting that even if
Weber's allegations amounted to a constitutional violation, the
CSRA and the WPA bar such claims.  The CSRA prevents the creation
of new judicial remedies for federal employees whose First
Amendment rights are violated by superiors.

     "We disagree with Weber that the defendants' actions fall
outside the scope of CSRA 'prohibited personnel practices,'" the
panel held.

     The panel added that the district court properly found that
Weber's due process claim based on revocation of his security
clearance was not a constitutional violation.

6TH CIR. REINSTATES SUIT
DESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCE
OFFICER FOR DISCOVERY

     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstated
a breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedly
failed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contracting
and Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).

     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trial court
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other reasons
to support the inference that Roots engaged in a course of conduct
to evade deposition and it must explain why lesser sanctions were
rejected.

     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liability
company, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., a
Cayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build a
government-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari government
terminated the construction contract due to Creighton's work
deficiencies and delays.

     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the Middle
District of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and an
accounting.

     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed the
Nashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chaired
Roots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At the
time, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari Interior
Ministry.

     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah was merely
a passive minority shareholder who performed no managerial duties,
received no salary and knew nothing about the company's business
operations; Roots also said its general manager, who was deposed,
had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospital project.
However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah was a policy
maker and an operational factor in Roots.

     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued that the
Qatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leave the
country; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy and
industry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.
Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as a
discovery sanction.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiam
opinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize
dismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, director or
managing agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissal was
an abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failed to
articulate sufficient findings of fact to justify the sanction, it
said.

     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, he
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other reasons
for Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support the inference
that Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evade deposition.
Those findings also should explain why lesser sanctions were
rejected, it said.  In addition, it said there should be findings
as to how the defendants would be prejudiced if they cannot depose
Al-Attiyah in Nashville.

CFC CAN HEAR CLAIMS
LATER FILED IN FED.
DIST. CT., CAFC RULES

     The U.S. Court of Federal Claims may retain jurisdiction over
a claim that is subsequently filed in federal district court, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) ruled Dec. 26,
reversing and remanding a suit filed by a government contractor
seeking equitable adjustment for a flood control project contract.
Hardwick Brothers Co. II v. United States, No. 93-5050 (CAFC).

     In its determination, the panel reviewed the language of 28
U.S.C. Section 1500 and concluded that as long as the claim is
filed first in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), the court may
retain jurisdiction.

     In 1980, Hardwick Brothers Co. II contracted with the Army
Corps of Engineers (COE) to build a levee for a flood control
project in Missouri.  Six years later, Hardwick submitted a claim
to the contracting officer under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA)
for adjustments to the contract price.

               The COE denied the claim, and Hardwick filed suit in the CFC,
seeking damages based on defective specifications, differing site
conditions, rescission of a changed proposal, contract reformation
and failure to disclose superior knowledge.  After waiting 18
months for an opinion, Hardwick filed a Federal Tort Claims Act
suit in March 1992 in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Missouri to avoid a time bar based on spoliation of
evidence.

     Meanwhile, in April 1992, the CAFC issued an opinion in UNR
Industries, Inc. v. United States, 962 F.2d 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1992),
which upheld the CFC's dismissal of asbestos manufacturers' claims
for indemnification for several personal injury suits.  These
claims were filed against the government in various district
courts, which were pending when the manufacturers filed the same
suits in the CFC.

     In UNR, the CAFC noted that under 28 U.S.C. Section 1500, it
"shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to
which the plaintiff...has pending in any other court any suit or
process against the United States."

     After the issuance of the UNR decision, Hardwick dismissed its
district court action before the government responded.  Then, the
government moved to dismiss Hardwick's CFC action, maintaining that
jurisdiction was not restored by Hardwick's dismissal of its
district court action.

     The court dismissed the claim without prejudice, holding that
there was "no material difference in the operative facts in the two
actions" and that, because the UNR decision is retroactive,
dismissal was required.  The trial court denied Hardwick's motion
for reconsideration and denied the contractor's pending motions to
file an amended and supplemental complaint as moot.

     Hardwick appealed to the CAFC, which reversed the decision of
the trial court.

     The CAFC panel referred to Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United
States, 170 Ct.Cl. 389, 343 F.2d 943 (1965), in which the CFC
examined Section 1500 and determined that the CFC can retain
jurisdiction if a claim was filed there before being filed in a
federal district court.  The CAFC noted that the Supreme Court did
not overturn Tecon, and it "acknowledged the continuing vitality of
Tecon as an established precedent."

     The CAFC rejected the government's argument that Tecon should
be limited to the "unusual" facts of that case.  "Nothing in Tecon,
UNR, or our recent cases citing Tecon supports such a limitation,"
held the panel. "[T]he trial court indicated that its decision on
the merits of Hardwick's claim was ready to issue, then this
court's decision in UNR prompted dismissal of the claim."  The
panel remanded the case for judgment in accordance with the trial
court's decision on the merits.
               Arguing for Hardwick were Michael J. Blake of Sandler, Balkin,
Hellman & Weinstein of Kansas City, with Lawrence Lerner on brief.
Arguing for the government was Margaret L. Baskette of the
Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice,
Washington, DC.  On brief were Assistant Attorney General Frank W.
Hunger, Director David M. Cohen and E. Kathleen Shanan.

CONTRACTOR ENTITLED TO
TAX CREDIT FOR AIRCRAFT
DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COSTS

     A research tax credit is available to a company that incurred
research costs in a fixed-price incentive contract with the
government, because although the government made progress payments
toward the research, it is not considered "funded" under Section
44F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, ruled the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).  Fairchild Industries, Inc.
v. United States, No. 94-5116 (CAFC).

     In its Nov. 29 opinion, the panel found that the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims incorrectly held that because the contractor
expected to be paid for the research by the government, it "did not
itself incur" the expenses.

     In July 1982, Fairchild Industries, Inc. entered into a fixed-
price incentive contract to produce the T-46A training aircraft for
the U.S. Air Force.  The contract included a full-scale development
(FSD) phase in which Fairchild was to develop two prototype
aircraft.  Under the contract, the Air Force was to pay for
research only if Fairchild met the contract specifications.

     Under the contract, the Air Force paid bimonthly progress
payments, which were a percentage of the expenditures Fairchild
incurred.  After formal acceptance of a line item, the payment was
liquidated by being credited against the total fixed price.  If the
Air Force terminated the contract for default, all payments were
repayable to the Air Force under the contract.

     The ceiling price for the FSD phase was $133 million.  When
Congress cancelled the T-46A program in late 1986, the Air Force
paid Fairchild $53 million for the completed work, and $60.8
million in unliquidated progress payments.  The two parties agreed
to termination for convenience.

     An Air Force audit showed Fairchild completed 90% of the FSD
work and was entitled to payment of $120.6 million.  The $53
million in liquidated progress payments and the $60.8 million in
unliquidated payments were applied, and the remaining $6.8 million
was paid.

     Fairchild reported $109.4 million in research expenses on its
1982-1985 federal income tax returns.  The Internal Revenue Service
disallowed $50.3 million, maintaining that it was "funded" by the
Air Force.  As a consequence of this decision, the IRS disallowed
$5.8 million in research tax credits claimed by Fairchild for 1983
and 1984.

     The research tax credit was created by the Economic Recovery
Tax Act of 1981, which provides a tax credit of 25% of increased
research expenditures, which are compared with a baseline measured
by the previous three years' research expenditures.  Under the act,
a contract customer can claim a research tax credit only if the
contract requires the customer to pay for the research even if it
is unsuccessful.  However, the customer cannot claim a tax credit
if the contract provides that the customer does not have to pay if
the research is successful.

     Fairchild filed a claim for the tax credit in the U.S. Court
of Federal Claims, which held that because Fairchild expected that
it would be paid for the research by the Air Force, it "did not
itself incur" the expenses because they were "funded" by the
government.  The court determined that although the contract
provided for return of the progress payments if the project were
not successful, this was not controlling because, through the
payments, Fairchild "was spending the government's money to conduct
the research, not its own."

     Fairchild appealed, contending the Air Force did not, in fact,
fund the research because its right to payment hinged on the
success of the research.  Moreover, Fairchild argued that according
to the Treasury Regulation, research cannot be considered "funded"
if (1) payment to the researcher rests upon the success of the
research, and (2) the researcher keeps "substantial rights in the
research."  Both parties agreed that Fairchild met the second
provision.

     Regarding the first provision, the government contended that
whether research is "funded" does not depend on whether, under the
contract, the government has the right not to pay for unsuccessful
research.  Rather, the government argued, payment of the research
must be "unexpected or surprising" in order for the contractor to
receive a tax credit.

     The CAFC panel found that the trial court properly determined
that the availability of the tax credit does not depend on whether
the researcher is paid; rather, it depends on whether the contract
requires payment upon success of the research.  However, the panel
held that the trial court erred in determining that Fairchild "did
not itself incur" the research expenditures, because Fairchild
"received payments under the contract as its research progressed."

     Because Fairchild received the progress payments, and it
expected to eventually be paid for the research, the trial court
mistakenly determined that Fairchild's right to payment did not
hinge on success as that term is used in the regulation, held the
panel.

                    The panel found that the progress payments did not, 
in fact, ,
alter the contract provision that Fairchild was not entitled to
keep any payments if it did not successfully produce the product
for which the payment was sent.  "A progress payment does not
commit the agency to accept unsuccessful performance, or to make
full or partial payment if the product is not successfully
produced," the panel found.

     The government contended that only under "risky and uncertain
fixed-price incentive contracts" would the researcher be entitled
to the tax credit, and that the availability of the tax credit
cannot be determined until the project is over and the degree of
the researcher's risk of nonpayment is known.

     The panel disagreed, holding that Congress designed the tax as
an incentive to divert additional resources to research by reducing
the cost of that additional research.  "In harmony with this
purpose, the regulations state that the research agreement must be
'entered into prior to the performance of the qualified research,'"
noted the panel.

     The panel concluded that this "wait and see" view cannot be
applied to Fairchild's contract, because it expressly provides that
the government may decline payment if the research is not
successful; therefore, the research is not "funded."

     Arguing for Fairchild was Albert G. Lauber Jr. of Caplin &
Drysdale in Washington, DC, with Ralph A. Muoio and Julie W. Davis
on brief.  Arguing for the government was Steven I. Frahm of the
Department of Justice, Washington, DC, with Assistant Attorney
General Loretta C. Argrett, Gary R. Allen and Jonathan S. Cohen on
brief.

ED VA FINDS CITY'S
DEVIATION FROM CONTRACT
SHIELDS SURETY

     A city's failure to conduct reasonable tests and inspections
of work done by a contractor constitutes material deviation from
its surety contract, a federal judge in Norfolk, VA, ruled Nov. 29,
finding that, as a result, the surety is not liable under its
performance bond.  Continental Insurance Co. v. City of Virginia
Beach, No. 2:95cv212 (ED VA).

     The city of Virginia Beach contracted with Utility Builders
Inc. to construct water and sewer lines for $1.33 million.
Continental Insurance Co. executed a $1.33 million performance and
payment bond in favor of the city.  Utility received periodic
payments totaling $1 million before the city learned the company
had filed for bankruptcy; the city then declared Utility in default
and withheld additional progress payments. Before doing so, the
city had not made the inspections and tests called for in the
contract.
               The city demanded Continental complete the original contract
as the performance bond surety.  Continental hired a consultant to
prepare rebid documents, selected a bidder and signed a tri-party
agreement with that contractor and the city.  Numerous defects in
Utility's work were found; Continental and the city agreed to share
the remediation costs. The parties spent $321,563 beyond the $1.33
million original contract price.

     Continental sued the city to collect $234,828 it paid the new
contractor to correct or complete Utility's work.  The
diversity-based complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia also sought prejudgment interest, consulting
fees and a declaratory judgment absolving Continental of further
liability under the contract.  The city counterclaimed for $86,736
it paid the new contractor for repairs; it also asked for
liquidated damages under the contract for late completion of the
project.

     After a bench trial, Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. awarded
Continental $234,828 plus consulting fees, offset by the city's
$86,736 counterclaim.  He denied prejudgment interest and a
declaratory judgment to Continental.  He also denied the city's
request for liquidated damages.

     Under the original contract, the city was required to
reasonably test and inspect Utility's work before making payments,
but failed to do so, he said, rejecting the city's argument that
the city had no such duty.  As a result, the city made monthly
progress payments prematurely to Utility in violation of the city's
contractual obligations, he said.

     That material deviation from the contract discharges
Continental from its obligations to the extent it was prejudiced by
the city's failure to test and inspect, he held, adding that the
city's policy encouraged contractors to take the money and run.
The premature payments also hurt the surety by significantly
decreasing the money available for the project.

     The judge also found inadmissible the city's attempt to offer
extrinsic evidence as to custom and usage pertaining to
inspections.

     He allowed $23,573 in engineering consulting fees as
foreseeable expenses after the city's material deviation but denied
prejudgment interest as a matter of discretion, saying both parties
acted in good faith in a bona fide legal dispute.  A declaratory
judgment was deemed unnecessary.

     Continental was represented by Timothy G. Clancy of Cumming,
Hatchett, Moschel, Patrick & Clancy in Hampton and by Wendy Ann
Hartmann and Robert F. Carney of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston in
Baltimore.  Charles Bernard Miller and Richard Jay Beaver of the
city attorney's office appeared for Virginia Beach.

ED MI FINDS COUNTY
CONTRACTOR NOT LIABLE
FOR INDEMNIFICATION

     As a matter of public policy and Michigan law, a county
contractor is not obligated to indemnify the county for gross
negligence by county employees, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals held Dec. 8, overturning summary judgment against a
contractor that provided medical services to jail inmates. Caldwell
v. Enyeart, No. 94-1406 (ED MI).

     Washtenaw County contracted with Correctional Medical Services
Inc. (CMS) to provide medical care to county jail inmates.  The
contract included a broadly worded indemnification provision.  In
1988, Willie Caldwell's mother, an asthmatic inmate, asked CMS
employees and a jail employee to hospitalize her; they failed to do
so, and she died the same night.

     Caldwell filed a Section 1983 complaint against the county in
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The
complaint also alleged gross negligence by county employees and
gross negligence and malpractice against CMS and CMS employees.
The county cross-claimed against CMS for indemnification.  The
county settled with Caldwell, but CMS won at trial on the
underlying claims.

     Judge Patrick J. Duggan granted summary judgment in favor of
the county on the cross-claim, ordering CMS to indemnify the county
for the settlement and its attorney fees.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed in a majority opinion by Judge H.
Ted Milburn and remanded the case to determine the nature of the
settlement between the county and Caldwell.

     If the settlement included damages for gross negligence by
county employees, CMS would not be obligated to indemnify the
county, according to the court.  Caldwell's claims against the
county included allegations of gross negligence, and both Michigan
public policy and statutes prohibit preinjury contracts to
indemnify a party for its own gross negligence.  On remand, the
trial judge must determine whether the settlement agreement
included any admission of liability or guilt by the county and
county employees.

     Dissenting, Judge David A. Nelson said the contract language
does not provide indemnification for the county's gross negligence
and, therefore, is enforceable under state law.  However, he said,
the case should be remanded to determine what proportion of the
settlement and fees were attributable to the conduct of CMS
employees; only that portion is subject to indemnification because
liability based on the county employees' conduct did not arise from
the underlying contract.
