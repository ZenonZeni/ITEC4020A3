<H1> Glossary of Terms </H1>

<DL>

<DT> <A NAME="apex"> Apex <DD> One of the three tips of the rotor.

<DT> <A NAME="bridgeport"> Bridge Port <DD> A radical alteration to
the intake ports of an RCE, extending them, but maintaining a bridge
of metal to retain rotor seals as they pass by.

<DT> <A NAME="eccentric"> Eccentric Shaft <DD> The shaft that the rotors
move around.  It has sections that are offset from the center.
Supercedes the piston engine's crankshaft.

<DT> <A NAME="epitrochoid"> Epitrochoid <DD> The curve that defines the
inner surface of the peripheral housing.  Generated by rolling a circle
around another circle (<A HREF = "j-epi.html">demonstrated in 44 KB of
Java</A>).  Perhaps should more correctly called peritrochoid.

<DT> <A NAME="housing"> Housing <DD> Supercedes piston cylinder walls
and head.  Two kinds: peripheral and side.  The latter has three
sub-types: front, central, and side (depending on the number of rotors).

<DT> <A NAME="peripheral-housing"> Peripheral Housing <DD> The metal
housing that contains the rotation of the rotor.  The shape is an
epitrochoidal curve.  It supercedes the piston engine's cylinders.

<DT> <A NAME="peritrochoid"> Peritrochoid <DD> Perhaps this is the
more correct name for epitrochoid.

<DT> <A NAME="piston-engine"> Piston Engine <DD> Plebian combustion
engine characterized by masses of metal being jerked backwards and
forwards.  Had 100 year headstart over RCE.

<DT> <A NAME="port"> Port <DD> An opening in the peripheral or side
housing to admit the air-fuel mixture or release the combustion
products.

<DT> <A NAME="porting"> Porting <DD> Modifying the intake ports
by cutting away metal.

<DT> <A NAME="RCE"> RCE <DD> Rotary Combustion Engine.  Not to be
confused with Restricted Coulomb Energy neural networks.

<DT> <A NAME="seals"> Seals <DD> Metal seals for the rotor tips and
sides supercede piston rings.  Rubber seals to mate the peripheral and
side housings.

<DT> <A NAME="side-housing"> Side Housing <DD> Fixed plate against which
a rotor slides.  Three sub-types: front, central, and side (depending on
the number of rotors).

<DT> <A NAME="tribology"> Tribology <DD> The study of friction.  From
French from Greek <EM>tribein</EM> to rub.

<DT> <A NAME="wankel"> Wankel <DD> <A HREF = "dr-wankel.html">Felix
Wankel</A>, inventor of the RCE.  Sometimes loosely used as a term for
an RCE.  As a point of trivia, this is also a Dutch and Afrikaans word
meaning "shaky, unstable, fickle" with senses of "stagger, reel".  In
that sense, one could make the observation that the rotor falls around
the stationary gear when being driven by the combustion.
