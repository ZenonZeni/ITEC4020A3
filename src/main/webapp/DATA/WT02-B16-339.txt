<b>JAMES BIRK </b>
<br>
<p>James Birk was selected by the Secretary of Energy to serve on The 
Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel and was elected its charter chairman in 
1993. Currently, Birk is manager of the Renewables and Hydro Business 
Unit at the Electric Power Research 
Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California. His organization's work 
resulted in commercial 
production, with KENETECH Windpower, of a new generation of wind turbines 
that 
provide electricity at a cost of less than $0.05 a kilowatt-hour. He has 
also provided 
technical guides to hydro plant owners that have helped them to reduce 
costs and 
enhance environmental performance 

<p>Before joining EPRI in 1973, Birk worked for Rockwell International 
Corporation's 
Atomics International Division, developing such technologies as 
clean-coal combustion, 
stack-gas emissions controls, and advanced batteries. He also worked on 
developing 
advanced batteries at Argonne National Laboratory while on loan from 
Rockwell.

<p>In addition to HTAP, Birk has served on several other technical review 
panels for 
both DOE and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, including the 
latter's 
Science and Industry Advisory Board. He earned a B.S. in chemistry from 
Iowa State 
University and a Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from Purdue.
