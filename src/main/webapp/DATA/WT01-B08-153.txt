<A NAME="move"></A><H2>Move toward the light!</H2><IMG SRC="ANGST.gif" ALIGN="right">
<P>Did you know that sunflowers face the sun because of a growth regulator called auxin?  Unequal light on each side of the stem causes auxin to build up on the shaded side.  The auxin buildup increases growth on that side of the stem, causing the stem to bend toward the light.  This habit, which allows plants to make the best use of available light, is known as phototropism.
Sunflowers are among the most popular flowers, and for good reason.  They are charming, cheerful, and fun to grow.  The heads, of course, are a source of food for people and animals. Sunflowers now range in color from red to yellow, from farm-size giants to a fuzzy double-flowered variety called "Teddy Bear." Garden centers now have entire seed racks devoted to sunflowers.
Sunflowers are perhaps the best choice for children because their rapid growth and impressive flowers provide a sense of accomplishment.</P>
The following sunflowers, which produce flowers on many branches, are especially good for cutting:<BR>
Teddy Bear      Luna<BR>
Primrose        Stella<BR>
Sungold Tithonia<BR>
Autumn Beauty<BR>
Q:  When is a flower not a flower?<BR>
<P>A:  When it is an inflorescence.  What most people think of as flowers in the composite family of plants are really numerous tiny flowers arranged in a compact head.  The petals of a daisy, for instance, are known botanically as ray florets.  Sunflowers are another familiar example.</P>

Hummingbirds eat half their weight in food everyday. <BR>

Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backward. They can also fly upside down and hover in their search for nectar and insects. <BR>

however, you'll never see a hummingbird walk. They will fly even to move an inch. Some hummers beat their wings 70 times each second! <BR>
