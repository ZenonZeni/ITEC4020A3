Efficiency</title></head><body>
<h1>Electric Utilities and Energy Efficiency</h1><p>
<p>
More than one-third (37%) of the energy used in the United States is used 
to
produce electricity.  Roughly 70% of that energy is lost in the process 
of
converting it to electricity and distributing the electricity to 
customers.
Any gains in the efficiency of this process could result in significant 
energy
savings for the country.  Electric utilities also have a unique ability 
to
encourage energy efficiency among their customers--an approach known as
demand-side management.  Both of these approaches help the environment by

avoiding power-plant emissions.<p>
<p>
<h2>Energy Efficiency in Production and Distribution of Electricity</h2>
Although most power plant efficiencies are limited to about 30% to 40%, 
some
efficiency improvements can be gained through the use of more efficient 
motors,
generators, and other electrical equipment.  The electrical equipment in 
power
plants consumes a significant fraction of the generated electricity.<p>

Advanced technologies for new fossil-fueled power plants may boost the
efficiencies in many cases to 50% (e.g., fuel gasification combined with 
an
advanced gas turbine), and in some cases to as high as 85% (e.g., fuel 
cells
combined with cogeneration). <p>

The current transmission and distribution systems in the United States 
are
designed for safety and reliability, but they are not necessarily energy
efficient.  The current designs allow power to travel through longer 
paths than
needed and even to circulate in loops through the distribution system.  
This
causes energy losses that could be avoided with better technology. <p>

New technologies (e.g., thyristor-controlled series capacitor [TCSC]) 
under
development by industry and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) allow an 
active
control of the distribution system to route power more efficiently 
through the
distribution grid.  This will save energy.<p>
<p>
<h2>Demand-Side Management</h2>
Utility investments in energy efficiency can keep utility bills lower 
because
they are more cost effective than building new power plants. For example, 
the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) has avoided rate increases 
for its
customers for 5 years by carrying out an aggressive energy efficiency
program.<p>

To meet the nation's projected growth in electricity needs during the 
next 10
years, $100 to $200 billion in new capital investment will be needed.  
However,
new power plants are quite expensive, and there is often strong local
resistance to power plant construction.  Because of this, many utilities 
are
doing whatever they can to reduce the demand for electricity and to defer 
new
power plant construction.<p>

The current situation is leading utilities to work with customers to 
reduce the
customer's electrical demands or to shift the customer's electricity use 
away
from the periods of high electrical demand.  This approach is called
demand-side management (DSM).<p>

Because DSM reduces the customers' electricity bills, it saves the 
customer
money. Some rate structures allow utilities to capitalize the money that 
they
spend on DSM, spreading the costs over 30 years.  The customer pays this 
cost,
but because it is less than the cost of the electricity saved, the 
customer
saves money.  The utility can also profit if it is allowed to collect a 
profit
on the DSM investment.  This creates a win-win situation for utilities 
and
their customers. <p>

DSM is a relatively new and growing service for electric utilities.  In 
1991,
U.S. utilities invested $2 billion in DSM technologies.<p>

In 1990, there were more than 1300 utility DSM programs in the United 
States
with 13 million customers participating, saving 0.6% of the nation's
electricity.  Experts predict that by 2000, the savings could increase to

2.2%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Economic Benefits</h2>
A 2% reduction in electricity use would cut the nation's electric bills 
by $6.1
billion per year, freeing up this money for investment or other 
spending.<p>
DSM programs are very labor intensive, so they produce new jobs.  In 1991

alone, utility DSM programs in Massachusetts created 2350 jobs.<p>
