<h1><center> MitoKor: The mitochondrial connection </h1> </center> <p>

The diseases targeted by MitoKor --  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus(NIDDM), and schizophrenia -- might appear to be unconnected. What they all share, however, is a defect in the mitochondrial DNA of related organs, according to Robert Davis, vice president and chief scientific officer. <P>
Mitochondria are the principal sites for the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which stores and supplies energy in cells. In the mid-1980s, molecular biologist Giuseppe Attardi of the California Institute of Technology reported on the significant role mitochondria play in a number of rare childhood muscle and nerve diseases. <P>

<b><center>More common than thought</b></center><P>

Since then, Attardi and others have demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction -- caused by defects in their DNA -- plays an important role in more common neurodegenerative, metabolic and psychiatric disorders that affect adults, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, NIDDM and schizophrenia. <P>

MitoKor (formerly Applied Genetics), was founded in 1992 by Dean Cuplin of GE Capital Ventures and Davis Parker, a neurologist at the University of Virginia. Parker's specialty, the biochemical effects of the electron transport chain in Parkinsons' and Alzheimer's diseases, led him to look for a mitochondrial characterization of these diseases, and to the analysis of patient tissues for evidence of mitochondrial damage. <P>

Integral to MitoKor's approach is creating cellular models of mitochondrial diseases, or cybrid cells, an expansion of Attardi's original research on cybrid cell technologies. <P>

<b><center>Cellular model</b></center><P>

Cybrid (cytoplasmic hybrid) cells use human neuroblastoma cells from which mtDNA has been removed, leaving the mitochondria themselves intact. Mutant human donor mtDNA is then fused into the energy-producing organelles, producing a cellular model of disease. <P>

The company is focusing on identifying and isolating mtDNA mutations that accumulate and thereby become problematic -- causing apoptosis in slowly dividing cells such as neurons, muscle, and pancreatic beta-cells. <P>

Normal and mutated mitochondria may co-exist in each cell in varying ratios, which allows mutated mtDNA to persist. It is only when the ratio of normal/mutated mtDNA tips toward greater mutational burden that the clinical symptoms of mitochondrial disorders appear, according to Davis. <P>

How much mutation is required for a mtDNA-based degenerative disorder to appear varies according to the individual, the organ system, and tissue affected. mtDNA is constantly exposed to free radical oxygen as a product of oxidative phosphorylation, which causes breaks in DNA chains that interfere with normal replication. Because mtDNA has no effective self-repair system, the mutations are replicated and passed down through generations of cells. <P>

<b><center>Free radicals</b></center><P>

In addition, Davis said, in some mitochondrial diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, malfunctioning mitochondria themselves produce free radicals, which damage other cellular structures, such as neurons and muscle. <P>

According to MitoKor, 60-70 percent of Alzheimer's is associated with mtDNA defects: specific point mutations in two mitochondrial genes have been linked to a form of sporadic Alzheimer's, which accounts for about 95 percent of all cases of the disease. The other 5 percent are considered familial, which is linked to Mendelian genetic inheritance. <P>

According to the company, the two mitochondrial mutations correspond to a high density of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle in the brains of patients with sporadic disease, determined upon autopsy. Conversely, these mutations are not found in patients with familial disease, senile dementia, or the Lewy Body variant of Alzheimer's (evidenced by brain lesions, high beta amyloid plaques, but few neurofibrillary tangles, and no known genetic link). <P>

MitoKor has developed a method of diagnosing mitochondrial sporadic Alzheim-er's (MSAD), and is developing therapeutics based on its understanding of the role of decreased oxidative phosphorylation and energy metabolism in these patients. <P>

The company has developed a cellular model for MSAD that is adaptable to high volume, automated screening of potential therapeutics using its cybrid cells. MitoKor has identified several small molecule therapeutic candidates that have effectively reversed the Complex IV cytochrome oxidase defect found in its cybrids by preventing increases in the concentration of free radicals. Cytochrome oxidase's main function is electron transport. The compounds are in preclinical testing. <P>

<b><center>In vitro test</b></center><P>

MitoKor also has developed a blood-based in vitro test for MSAD that incorporates the specific point mutations in mtDNA that encode for cytochrome oxidase. The test is being used by two undisclosed pharmaceutical companies in Phase II and III trials to confirm diagnoses of more than 800 symptomatic sporadic Alzheimer's patients. This test will be offered as a service in the reference laboratory by the end of the year, Davis said. <P>

The company also has investigated a mitochondrial inherited factor in Parkinson's, which it believes may account for its sporadic occurrence, by creating cybrid cells with mitochondria donated by Parkinson's patients. These cells are deficient in the mitochondrial enzyme NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), also involved in electron transport, which has been shown to be deficient in the brains and blood of Parkinson's patients. The company is screening for therapeutic compounds, and searching for defects in the genes that encode for Complex I. <P>

In diabetes, MitoKor has found evidence of mtDNA dysfunction in the blood of NIDDM patients. Formation of free radicals and alkylation of DNA and proteins occur regularly in pancreatic islet beta cells, and the unprotected mitochondrial genome is open to attack from these free radicals. MitoKor is creating cybrid cell models of NIDDM that overproduce free radicals, and has begun genetic screening of NIDDM tissues to isolate the specific event that causes the disruption in mitochondrial activity. <P>

<b><center>Schizophrenia connection</b></center><P>

Finally, MitoKor believes that schizophrenia has a genetic component and that its sporadic occurrence involves a mixture of mutations of nuclear DNA and mtDNA. A study of autopsied brains of schizophrenics by researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry in London isolated five gene clones that indicate the disease is linked to mutations in mtDNA. MitoKor has begun work with cybrid cell models of the disease to search for its genetic cause. <P>

The company raised $650,000 in seed financing in 1992 from El Dorado Ventures, and raised $4 million in first round funding from El Dorado, SR One, SenMed and MDS Health Ventures. MitoKor has a $3.4 million bridge loan from the same group, and is in the midst of raising a $6-$7 million round. <P>
