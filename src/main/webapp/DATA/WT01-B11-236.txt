<h1>Expert Systems</h1>
<p>Expert systems are computer programs designed to review a set of facts (knowledge base) and apply a set of rules to arrive at 
the same conclusion that a team of experts would make if presented with the same set of facts. There are three primary 
components to an expert system: rules, knowledge base, and inference engine. </p>
<p>An expert system begins by capturing human expertise in the form of IF/THEN rules. For example, the rule &quot;IF the traffic light 
is red THEN step on the brake,&quot; captures one small aspect of driving expertise. Often dozens (or hundreds) of such rules are 
required to arrive at solutions to complicated problems. </p>
<p>The next step in the process involves applying the rules against a set of facts to determine which rules apply. Embedded within 
the expert system is an inference engine which determines when and how to apply the rules. </p>
<p>The unique order in which the rules are applied to a given set of facts allows the expert system to be dynamic. As one might 
expect given the features and capacity of these technologies, the number of potential good solutions to a problem can be vast. 
To further analyze the vast array of good solutions, LBS employs another type of Computational Intelligence known as Genetic 
Algorithms. </p>
