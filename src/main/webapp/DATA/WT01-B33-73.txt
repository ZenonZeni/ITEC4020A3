<h1>WHY DO WE MAKE MAJOR PROBLEMS OUT OF MINOR DRUGS OF ABUSE? </h1>

<p>MAKING CITIES LIVABLE </p>

<p>Note from Cliff Schaffer: </p>

<p>Dr. Meyers was the head of the Research Advisory Panel for the
state of California. In essence, he was the man picked by the
state of California to head up their long-term evaluation of the
drug problem. As such, he probably knows as much about the
subject as anyone on earth. I always find his comments
interesting and enlightening. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>What is your reaction to my appearance today? Possibly you are
thinking, &quot;Oh my God, here is another drug expert who has
imposed on his long association and, friendship with the Lennards
to get on the program at this prestigious meeting to intrude on <u>our</u>
interests. He is going to tell us how terrible <u>the</u> drug
problem is, how it is the factor making <u>all</u> neighborhoods
unlivable and how impossible it will be for us to improve the
livability of our cities until we eliminate drug use. The steps
to be taken will involve inflating his personal status and
providing more money for damaging treatment, irrelevant research,
dehumanizing enforcement or wherever else his entrenched interest
lies. And he will get everything wrong including failing to
recognize that the factors that depreciate the livability of our
cities also cause drug abuse and not the other way around. </p>

<p>Now actually that is what I think that your reaction <u>should</u>
be. If you agree, I might be well advised to simply stop<b>.</b> </p>

<p>However, you should, I believe, hear me further to protect
your plans for change. An hysterical, ineffectual &quot;War on
Drugs&quot;, which is what we are currently experiencing, will
absorb funds and energy, provide excuses for inaction and
deviousness and criminalize large groups within our society. Our
present ineffective course will not change until: </p>

<p>I ) The public is taught the difference between drug effects
and societal reaction to the presence of those drugs; the
difference between drug effects and the associated criminal
activity of the marketplace for an expensive, illegal commodity. </p>

<p>2) We consider that the unlivability of some of our
neighborhoods and the factors that have led to that unlivability
may be causes of drug abuse. The use of a given drug by a
specific route of administration (e.g., smoking crack) is not
uniformly distributed throughout our cities. </p>

<p>We do not have <u>a</u> drug problem. Different agents are
used and by different routes of administration. Different drugs
have differing inherent dangers and elicit different emotional
reactions from the citizenry. </p>

<p>Let's contrast two specific drugs, alcohol and heroin. </p>

<p>Alcohol, like all sedatives, gives a pharmacologic reward. It
relieves anxiety but also impairs judgment and psychomotor
performance and causes excitement. Alcohol as a direct drug
effect, that is because it is a disinhibitory agent, leads
directly to crime and antisocial behavior. Quantitatively, it is
by far the most important drug of abuse, being involved in half
of the homicides, half of the fatal auto accidents, etc. </p>

<p>Heroin, in contrast, is inherently not very dangerous. The
direct effect is to quiet the individual. Henry and I have long
enjoyed Baldwin's statement that for many years what kept the
peace in Harlem was Jesus and junk. You as citizens agree that
narcotics are not very dangerous by providing people with a daily
huge dose of methadone, a potent narcotic, as treatment for their
use of a potent narcotic, heroin. </p>

<p>However, the societal reaction to the two drugs is not
consistent with their danger. No one is ever more than a few
steps from a drink or a bottle, The U.S. briefly tried the
&quot;noble experiment&quot; of prohibition but abandoned it
because the criminal activity associated with illegal booze was
judged to be intolerable. </p>

<p>Yet our reaction to heroin use is to assign heavy penalties
for its mere possession and to harass and isolate the user. I
understand punishing an overt criminal act but do not understand
the moralizing that underlies the terribly vindictive attitude
toward heroin. Injecting heroin is fairly described as chemical
masturbation, not inherently a heinous act however distasteful. I
think that the citizenry is deliberately misinformed by people
with an interest in maintaining the size of the drug problem and
the current hysterical reaction. </p>

<p>Prohibition does not work; nothing we have done in the past 40
years has worked. It is time for the political and intellectual
leaders of this country to openly criticize our present efforts,
resist the current panic reaction by citizens and elected
officials and help us redirect our efforts toward our youth, our
economy and our cities. </p>

<p>There are some individuals and groups who plan to suggest
legislation to decriminalize (not legalize) some areas of drug
use. When you hear of the proposed legislation, I hope that you
listen to argument <u>pro</u> as well as <u>con</u>. </p>

<p>If we can cease destroying each other over quantitatively
unimportant drugs, we can close some prisons and get on with the
primary problems -- humanizing the urban environment and working
on the important public health problems presented by alcohol,
poverty and mental illness. </p>
