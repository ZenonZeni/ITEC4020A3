TREASURY REPORT SAYS BYE-BYE TO INSURED BICS

The U.S. Treasury's report on modernizing the financial system calls
for the elimination of deposit insurance coverage for bank investment
contracts.
    The Treasury's report says BICs are an example of how "pass-through"
insurance can create competitive inequities.
    "In recent years, banks have begun to offer a product similar to GICs
(guaranteed investment contracts), called bank investment contracts, or
BICs, which explicitly take advantage of pass-through deposit insurance as
a marketing tool," the report said.
   The report acknowledges that banks can effectively manage the greater
degree of interest rate risk from BICs through contract limitations and
hedging strategies.
    The problem remains, however, that BICs are fully insured by the
government.
    "This provides banks with a new opportunity to attract large deposits
by expanding the use of the government's guarantee," the Treasury said.
    "Meanwhile, insurance companies offering GICs totally outside of the
safety net do not have this competitive advantage," it said.
   The Treasury report also said banking organizations should be permitted
to offer BICs to pension fund managers, but without extending to them
federal deposit insurance.

U.K. REGULATOR MAY WIDEN MORTGAGE-BACKED MARKET

Britain's building societies and mortgage lenders are confident that
the Building Societies Commission will reverse its proposals for the
continued exclusion of sterling mortgage-backed securities from the list
of instruments that thrifts can hold as liquid assets.
    A favorable decision will provide considerable new support for the
mortgage-backed securities market in Britain, giving greater placement
depth to the market and increasing overall market liquidity,
securitization specialists say. The ban was originally proposed in a
consultation paper issued by the Commission, the industry regulator for
thrifts, late last year. It proposed several amendments to the Building
Societies (Liquid Assets) Regulations of 1987, which sets the assets that
building societies may hold as liquid, easily divested assets.
    Mortgage-backeds were among the securities it ruled were not suitable
to be classed as liquid holdings. It said the mortgage-backed market in
Britain was not sufficiently developed to provide "an appropriate" medium
for thrifts' liquidity management.
    The Commission determined that assets must provide maximum capital
certainty and must be fully marketable. It said this must be achieved by
the assets having daily quoted, freely available prices and should be
traded on a recognized money market or stock exchange.
    Mortgage-backed securities tend to be held by institutional investors
to maturity, resulting in relatively low levels of trading and, therefore,
limited market liquidity, specialists say. When the mortgage market was in
its early stages in the mid-1980s, it was easy to understand why the
product should not be included as a liquid asset. But the market now
totals 9.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) in outstanding issues and is
considered well established, its promoters say. The Commission has asked
its members to give their views on the liquidity issue and these responses
are now being studied. An official announcement is expected within three
months.
    The Council of Mortgage Lenders, keen to see the development of
mortgage-backed securities, has previously voiced concern over the
Commission's ruling. Council members believe that mortgage bonds should
fully qualify as liquid assets, as Class-1 securities which carry the
highest rating.
    "Given the depth, quality, trading activity and number of market
making brokers in mortgage-backed securities, there seems no reason why
they should not be treated as first-class assets," a source at one
mortgage lender said. When the Commission was reviewing last year whether
mortgage-backeds should be reclassified as Class-1 assets, thrifts and
other mortgage lenders were convinced the regulator would decide to
include the securities. A substantial amount of lobbying has been taken
place on the issue, which should result in the Commission agreeing to
overturn the proposal, specialists say.

SWISS BANK GROUP BACKS $500 MILLION MICHIGAN NOTES

Karen Pierog
Michigan last week sold $500 million of general obligation notes that
featured an unconditional standby note purchase agreement provided by a
consortium of three Swiss banks.
    The standby agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.
and Credit Suisse obligates the banks to provide funds for the principal
and interest payments on the notes in the event that money in the state's
set-aside fund for the issue are insufficient. The banks' participation in
the note issue is split into thirds.
    Susan Kish, a vice president at UBS, said that unlike a normal standby
purchase agreement, the pact between the banks and Michigan is
unconditional.
    "In a normal standby purchase agreement, there are usually conditions
that have to be satisfied before the facility can be drawn, such as no
event of default or bankruptcy," she explained. "In this agreement,
neither of those is applicable."
    Kish said the only conditions the state must meet are legal ones
involving the state's obligation to repay the banks.
    The notes were priced last week by a Prudential Securities Inc. group
to yield 4.60% to the Sept. 31, 1991 maturity. The were originally priced
to yield 4.65%, but strong investor demand for the notes enabled the
underwriters to trim the yield by five basis points.
    State officials made the decision to place a credit enhancement on the
issue about two weeks ago. The state had originally planned to sell the
note issue unenhanced last month but delayed the pricing because of a Feb.
6 state appellate court decision that called into question $450 million a
year of the state's single-business tax revenues, according to Nick
Khouri, the state's deputy treasurer.
    Khouri said when Gov. John Engler, on March 5, proposed a revenue
neutral amendment to the tax that would counter the fiscal effects of the
court ruling, the state decided to proceed with a credit-enhanced cash
flow borrowing to speed up the process.
    "We wanted to do the deal as quickly as possible at the highest
rating," he explained, adding that arbitrage considerations, which would
earn the state $25,000 a day, were also a factor in moving quickly on the
deal.
    The state also had to contend with the fact that on January 23,
Standard & Poor's Corp. placed $3.14 billion of state debt on CreditWatch
with negative implications, after the state Legislature and the Engler
administration reached an impasse over dealing with a current year budget
deficit.
    "We believe the use of this credit enhancement should negate that
impact in the market," said Wayne Workman, a senior vice president at
Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., the financial adviser on the deal.
    And the state - with a credit enhancement mechanism from the Swiss
banks that resembles a hybrid between a direct-pay letter of credit and a
standard standby purchase agreement - received the highest short-term
ratings of SP-1-plus from Standard & Poor's, MIG-1 from Moody's Investors
Service, and F-1-plus from Fitch Investors Service Inc.
    "The whole gist of the deal is that it walks and talks like a letter
of credit, but it's not," said Kevin Burke, a public finance director at
Prudential Securities Inc., the senior manager on the deal.

HOW MOODY'S ANALYZES BOND INSURANCE FIRMS

The following is excerpted from Moody's Investors Service's Global
Credit Analysis, published by IFR Books in London. In this excerpt,
Moody's describes some of its credit analysis methods for rating
individual corporate guarantors.

Organizational Structure

    A corporate financial guarantor's overall structure is an important
consideration in determining its ultimate ability and willingness to meet
policyholder obligations. As a starting point, Moody's analysts review all
of the company's operating units on a consolidated basis and examine any
intercompany reinsurance that may be in effect.
    To understand the true economic risk profile of the operation, the
company's reinsurance assumptions and cessions and the expense allocations
of individual companies are reviewed on a consolidated basis. This
analysis recognizes that most insurers have sufficient financial
flexibility to move corporate resources to individual subsidiaries, giving
them the ability to support weak units. Despite company-specific
restrictions which may be in effect, the confidence/sensitive nature of
the public debt market provides the insurer with a major incentive to make
good on claims of all its affiliated operating corporations.
    The activities of non-operating insurance units are also reviewed. For
example, the debt-to-equity ratios of holding companies or other
subsidiaries that have issued debt are examined, as are their debt service
capabilities. Potential demands under expected and stress conditions
should permit the company to meet its obligations and still allow adequate
subsidiary capital growth for business expansion. The key objective of
this analysis is to determine the insurer's true economic costs; amount
and type of affiliated reinsurance; and amount and holders of any debt.
Management has sufficient discretion within the regulatory structure to
permit the obligations or resources of affiliates to affect the insurer's
own ability to perform on policyholder obligations.
    While asset quality has primacy over other financial factors, earnings
are critical to a bond insurer's long-term creditworthiness because they
will dictate the company's ability to generate sufficient capital
internally or to maintain access to external sources of capital to meet
future needs.
    Corporate bond insurers do not generally have a standard premium
structure dictated by regulations. The starting point in analyzing the
quality of earnings is an assessment of the company's statutory accounting
compared with existing practices elsewhere in the financial markets. In
the U.S. markets, bond insurance premiums are typically priced in relation
to their value in reducing the debt issuer's total debt service cost.
Accordingly, while large up-front premiums are common in the municipal
bond insurance market, the predominance of shorter-term and amortizing
debt service in the corporate markets has meant that more premiums are
received annually. In essence, premiums represent a contractually agreed
rate multiplied by the periodic balance of principal (or debt service)
outstanding. It is not uncommon for corporate bond insurers to charge a
larger first-year premium with subsequent renewals at lower rates.

Capital Adequacy

    This key factor is best measured by relating the insurer's loss
potential to total capital (surplus plus contingency reserves). New York
State has established standards for the maximum risk-to-capital ratio;
risk is defined as aggregate policyholder limits or insured par. For most
bond insurers, this equals total debt service, or the entire amount of
debt issued. These regulations differentiate various types of underlying
insured obligations, with capital requirements varying between $300 of
risk to $1 of capital (municipal), to $100 of risk to $1 of capital
(corporate). Note, however, that from the credit analyst's point of view,
this gross measurement of risk has several major shortcomings.
    First, reported statutory risk for partial bond coverage versus 100%
coverage need not be consistent with true loss potential. This risk
measurement problem is similar to that experienced by first-loss letters
of credit or subordinated securities; although the dollar volume of the
obligation is important, it does not necessarily reflect the likely losses
on a pool of assets in the event of default.
    Second, the loss potentials of transactions, even within a particular
category defined by regulators, can vary dramatically. Third, neither
repayment sources nor temporal, geographic or originator diversification
is captured by the statutory risk measurement.
    Many other factors can vary significantly among companies and should
be considered within the unique context of a particular management
strategy, including the size of the unearned premium reserve, composition
of revenue between renewal and up-front premiums, the term of existing
insured exposures, and the quality of investment assets. Because of the
interactive nature of portfolio losses, revenue generation and the
historical position of a company, the impact of these factors frequently
can be clarified through computer simulation. Simulations are viewed as
only one of many tools necessary to assess the risk profile of a company
even when transaction quality estimates are available.
    Moody's model for corporate bond insurers incorporates historical
statutory balance sheet and income statements for an individual company,
company specific insured portfolio characteristics related to sector, and
the quality and contractual elements of reinsurance. The model can also
project a variety of outcomes depending on assumptions on key variables
such as premium rates, volume of business written, loss development and
quality, seasoning, and sector characteristics unique to the company.

FDIC INSURANCE STUDY OUT

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released a study on bank deposit
insurance that includes sections on how the private sector might
participate in the program in the future, according to George E. French,
chief of the financial markets section in the FDIC's research department.
    "The private insurer would set the premium rate and the FDIC would
base its premium level on the private insurer's risk estimates," French
said. He added that the full premium might not be downstreamed to the
private reinsurer.
    The FDIC has met with the staff of Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., who has
proposed legislation to reform deposit insurance, French said.
    The FDIC's report does not contain an extensive discussion of state
insurance systems or moving to a purely private insurance system, French
stressed. Moreover, the technical aspects of how contracts should be
written has not begun.
    The Treasury report's suggestion for the FDIC to do a pilot project,
which would include several banks and insurance companies, was favorably
received, French said. "We've already met with members of the municipal
bond insurance industry and their ideas are very useful," he said.
    Financial guaranty industry executives interested in receiving a copy
of the report can contact French at 202-898-3929. Industry representatives
interested in participating in any pilot projects can contact FDIC
chairman L. William Seidman or W. Roger Watson, director of research.
    "We're presented with an opportunity to become a part of history by
cooperating with the U.S. government and helping form policies that will
guide the financial services industry into the 21st century," a senior
executive of a financial guaranty company said. "I think the industry may
shake its head in disbelief, years from now, if we miss this opportunity."

QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, STRESSED BY ENHANCE UNIT

Guaranty Risk Services Inc. acted as financial adviser on about $58
million taxable and tax-exempt principal and interest last year that was
insured by Asset Guaranty Reinsurance Co., according to Kenneth C.
Sherman, GRS senior vice president in charge of originations.
    While GRS acknowledges the dollar amount is not large compared to the
amounts insured by the major monoline financial guarantors, the firm is
pleased with the high quality of the deals it did. "Given the real estate
markets, we could have done a ton of deals, but not with the same credit
quality," said a GRS spokesman.
    GRS, a subsidiary of Enhance Financial Services Group, was formed last
year to originate and underwrite deals that are subsequently insured by
Asset Guaranty. That insurance is rated triple-A by Duff & Phelps Inc.
    "The differential between unenhanced and Asset Guaranty enhanced
transactions has been roughly 200 basis points," Sherman added.
    To date, deals originated and underwritten by GRS have all been real
estate related. GRS is interested in smaller, middle-market transactions
that have a high credit quality.
    "We do not originate deals that primary insurance companies would
insure," Sherman said.
    Currently, GRS has about $60 million in deals in its underwriting
pipeline and several should appear in the market during April. GRS'
average deal size is between $3 million and $10 million.
    Most of GRS' deals have been multifamily housing transactions that
refund or restructure existing debt.
    "GRS will not accept construction, lease-up or refurbishing risks,"
Sherman stressed. Issues can be structured with these risks if an approved
third party is willing to take the risk instead of GRS, he said.
   GRS is finding its business growing at a fast pace because regional
investment banks around the nation are trying to find credit enhancers
following the pullback by banks and savings and loans in providing letters
of credit. Additionally, the government enhancement programs are moving at
a "sluggish" pace, Sherman reported.
    Not only are regional investment banks welcoming GRS, Sherman said,
but the investment community is referring deals to it.
    "Investors are doing their due diligence, and the depth and level of
GRS' underwriting has prompted some investors to send deals to us," he
explained.
    GRS' underwriting department has several criteria that must be met.
First, underwriters look at the cash flow and demand debt coverage of
greater than 1.25 times. Additionally, the loan to value ratio must not
exceed 75%. "These two criteria work together because a deal with a 90%
loan to value is not going to have 1.25 times the coverage," he said.
    Finally, GRS requires an equity contribution from the developer,
typically at least 10%, Sherman said. This equity contribution makes it
harder for a developer to walk away from any deal. GRS-approved
transactions usually have a maturity of 10 to 12 years.
    During 1990, GRS acted as financial advisor to Asset Guaranty, which
insured the following transactions:
    * $9.36 million multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for
Mankato, Minnesota. The placement agent was Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.,
and the underlying credit support was provided by the Highland Hills of
Mankato Limited Partnership Project.
    * $1.7-million industrial development revenue bonds for the
Development Authority of Cartersville, Georgia. The sole underwriter for
the transaction was Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. The bonds are
supported by the Nantucket Industries Inc. project and are subject to a
mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2001.
    * $8.9-million industrial development refunding revenue bonds for the
Illinois Development Finance Authority. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. and Young Capital Corp. were co-underwriters. The $8.5
million tax-exempt series-A refunding bonds and $400,000 series-B revenue
bonds are supported by the Orleans-Institute Place Associates Project.
    * $6.78 million of multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for the
North Dakota Housing Finance Agency. The deal was managed by Dain Bosworth
Inc.
     * $6.8-million Series-1 commercial development revenue refunding
bonds and $470,000 Series-2 taxable commercial development revenue
refunding bonds for the Port Authority of St. Paul, Minn. Dain Bosworth
was sole manager. Fort Road Medical/Irvine Park Towers Project provided
the underlying credit support.

FSA-BACKED PROGRAM BOOSTS AUSSIE SECURITIZATION

    An Australian special-purpose corporation that carries credit
insurance from Financial Security Assurance is planning to sell its second
and third offerings of asset-backed securities.
    The corporation, known by its acronym, SAFE - for Secured Asset
Funding Entity Ltd. - was set up last year by Bankers Trust Australia Ltd.
to offer a quicker way for issuers to securitize both mortgage and non
mortgage assets through a standardized format.
    Securities issued through SAFE are backed by FSA and the State
Government Insurance Commission of South Australia. FSA is the senior
guarantor of the pro-gram, and securities issued through it are triple-A
rated. South Australia is rated double-A-plus.
    So far, one issue has been done through SAFE - last November, a $100
million (Australian) offering by Town & Country W.A. Building Society was
backed by residential and commercial mortgages. That deal consisted of
five-year fixed bullet bonds.
    In the latest transactions, retailer David Jones is planning to
securitize credit card receivables, and the St. George Building Society is
offering mortgage-backed bonds. FSA would not confirm that either deal is
in the works.
    The Jones securitization is a resurfacing of a financing plan that
France's Societe Generale was putting together last year. Originally
planned to be launched internationally out of Hong Kong, the A$180 million
transaction will be now be issued through SAFE in the Australian domestic
market.
    A dealer group of seven banks is participating in the transaction,
with Societe Generale acting as arranger.
    St. George is pressing ahead with a mortgage-backed transaction,
totaling about A$200 million. When the SAFE concept was first announced,
it was expected that St. George and Beneficial Finance would launch issues
early in 1991. But Beneficial's plans are on hold, apparently due to loan
loss problems among affiliates in the Australian banking system.
    Sources say the new transactions will help popularize the concept of
securitization after some recent setbacks in Australia, including doubts
over a special vehicle devised by Schroders Australia Ltd., which would
have been Australia's first internationally rated vehicle for securitized
mortgages. The entity was named PUMA, for Pooled Unlisted Mortgage Assets.
Schroders initially hoped to raise A$50 million through it by the end of
1990. But the difficulties in the Australian bond market prompted
Schroders last month to cancel its plans to enter the secondary mortgage
market.

MOODY'S COVERS THE SECONDARY

Moody's Investors Service has begun a new publication that tracks bond
insurance activity on a weekly basis, publicly divulging, for the first
