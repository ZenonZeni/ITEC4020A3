<h2>Patricia Spain Ward</h2>

<p><img src="banner1.gif" alt="*">

<p>Patricia Spain Ward, author of "History of the Gerson Therapy", is one of a

baker's dozen best medical historians in the United States.  This paper was

originally written by Dr. Ward under a contract to the U.S. Congressional

Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) during its evaluation of alternative

methods of cancer management. This article, along with two others by Dr.

Ward, were suppressed by OTA staff until their release under pressure from

U.S. Senator Charles Grassley of the Technology Assessment Board of

Congress. Her experience with OTA, the process which led to drastic changes

in the "Unconventional Cancer Treatments" document, and her impressions of

important participants in that process, have had a significant impact on

her and on U.S. cancer medicine.
