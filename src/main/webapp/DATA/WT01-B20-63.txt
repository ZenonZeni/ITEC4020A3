<p align="center">March 2, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Sunday Los Angeles Times Front Page: S.F.
Cannabis Buyers' Club</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 26, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> published a detailed
article on the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Francisco.&nbsp; The
following are selected excerpts; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This is a different kind of drug store...dozens of people sit on
rummage-sale couches and folding chairs, smoking high-grade
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is business as usual at the Cannabis Buyers' Club, a
flourishing illegal marijuana market rooted in civil
disobedience.&nbsp; But this is a club no rational person would
aspire to join.&nbsp; Doing your shopping here means you are sick
or dying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The underground pharmacy is part of a growing movement aimed at
gaining sick people the right to use marijuana.&nbsp; Across the
country thousands of patients with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis and other illnesses defy the law daily to
treat their ailments or ease their pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In San Francisco, long known for its tolerance, authorities have
chosen to ignore the law, saying that sick people who can benefit
from the plant should be able to buy it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">'I have no problem whatsoever with the use of marijuana for
medical purposes,&quot; said [San Francisco] Mayor Frank Jordan,
a former police chief.&nbsp; &quot;I am sensitive and
compassionate to people who have legitimate needs.&nbsp; <u>We
should bend the law and do what's right</u>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[In opposing the use of marijuana as medicine] Mike Heald, Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman, said marijuana is strictly
controlled because the public does not believe that smoking it is
proper behavior.&nbsp; [Mr. Heald is enveloped in the &quot;myth
of consensus&quot; -ed.] He said marijuana, like alcohol and
tobacco, is a &quot;gateway&quot; substance that leads to the use
of hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD -- a contention
disputed by marijuana advocates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The club was founded in 1991, and more than 3,000 people bearing
notes from their doctors have flocked to the...club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Some that have claimed to have benefited from the club] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* AIDS patient Jon Bush gained 30 pounds in the past six months
[with the use of marijuana] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Hazel Rodgers, 75, volunteers her time at the club while at the
same time using marijuana to treat her glaucoma.&nbsp; Rodgers
was referred to the club by [SF] county supervisor Angela Alioto. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am an extremely strong advocate of medicinal
marijuana,&quot; Alioto said, &quot;I saw it work&quot;.&nbsp; [Alioto's
late husband used marijuana to treat the adverse reaction from
his cancer chemotherapy treatments. -ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>California Assemblyman's Bill Could Relieve
The Need For Cannabis Buyer's Club</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 1, Sacramento, CA, California Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) is sponsoring a medical marijuana bill,
AB 1597, which would exempt patients with a physician's recommendation
from laws against personal possession and cultivation of
marijuana.&nbsp; The bill is similar to the medical marijuana
initiative being proposed by Californians for Compassionate Use (CCU)
for the 1996 ballot. </p>

<p>[For more information, contact either CCU at 415-864-1961 or
California NORML at 415-563-5858.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Iowa State Senators Urge Senator Harkin To
Support Medical Marijuana Research</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 21, Three prominent state senators from Iowa sent a
letter to Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) prodding him to pressure the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allow a long
delayed medical study of the therapeutic effects of marijuana on
patients with AIDS.&nbsp; [This letter is representative of the
numerous letters that have been sent by elected state officials
all over the U.S. to federal representatives and officials within
the government.&nbsp; To date, 36 states have passed legislation
expressing their desire to see marijuana be made more readily
available for patients coping with life and/or sense-threatening
diseases or ailments.&nbsp; The problem is a recalcitrant and
unresponsive federal bureaucracy. -ed.] A selected excerpt of the
IA state senators letter follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are respectfully asking that you consider contacting Dr.
Philip Lee, Asst. Sec. for HHS, and express your support for
allowing the first research project concerning medical marijuana
in over a decade.&nbsp; Our only objective is to find out exactly
how safe and effective marijuana is in treating glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, AIDS and AIDS-related wasting syndrome, and
cancer.&nbsp; Many patients in Iowa, as well as the rest of the
United States, are eagerly anticipating the results from Dr.
Abrams' study [the long delayed study -ed.], and we ask that you
encourage this to happen.&quot; </p>

<p>[For more information on the struggle for legal access to
medicinal marijuana in Iowa, contact Iowa NORML's Carl Olsen at
515-262-6957.&nbsp; For further information on the long delayed
Abrams' study and a listing of federal representatives who are
lobbying HHS to allow the study to proceed, contact MAPS' Rick
Doblin at 704-358-0138.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Liberty Lovers -- Beware The Ides Of March!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Excerpts from FIJA release] On March 15, wholesale florist
Yvonne Regas of Sparks, NV will be arraigned in U.S. District
Court in Reno, on charges of (1) Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; (2)
Aiding and abetting Obstruction of Justice; and (3) Jury
Tampering. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Before deciding that such dastardly behavior deserves swift, sure
punishment -- such as the three to six years in prison this could
cost Ms. Regas, if convicted -- consider what she actually did:
she and a few friends put brochures published by Fully Informed
Jury Association (FIJA) under the wiper blades of cars parked
near the courthouse, during the trial of her son and ex-husband,
among others, on drug charges.&nbsp; That's it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">These brochures -- which have been distributed similarly by
untold numbers of people at hundreds of court houses around the
country over the past five years -- explain the rights, powers, and
responsibilities of trial jurors.&nbsp; Often, the brochures are
handed to all who enter the court house. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The point of the leafleting has been to advise jurors that they
possess the power to judge the law itself, and not just &quot;the
facts&quot;, as most modern jury instruction insist.&nbsp;
&quot;Jury nullification of law&quot; means that &quot;the
governed -- if informed of their power as jurors -- can
&quot;just say no&quot; to bad laws, and thereby check and
balance the government.&nbsp; [It is for this reason that NORML
supports the efforts of FIJA. Just imagine if every juror in a
marijuana-related case knew that they possess the power and
authority to nullify &quot;bad law&quot;.&nbsp; Is it possible
that there would be a marked reduction in criminal convictions
for marijuana-related &quot;crimes&quot;?&nbsp; Further, would
the government then realize that they've been operating under the
`myth of consensus' and substantively amend the law? -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Regas case has attracted some of the nation's premier
constitutional lawyers: Dr. Nancy Lord, Larry Becraft, and
(possibly) Jonathan Emord.&nbsp; They see this as a watershed
case for both the First and Sixth Amendments, and believe that
conviction of Ms. Regas could result in erosion of the rest of
the Bill of Rights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Regas is convicted, Nancy Lord fears it could also lead to
prosecutions [and certainly intimidation -ed.] of FIJA activists
around the country. </p>

<p>[To find out more about the Regas case, contact <b>LAWYERS FOR
LIBERTY</b>, c/o Nancy Lord, 1718 Peachtree St. NW, ste. 499,
Atlanta, GA 30309 or call 404-963-6932.&nbsp; For further information
