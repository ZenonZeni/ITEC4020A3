Minutes of the eighth meeting of the<br>
<H2>HYDROGEN TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANEL</H2><p>
<b><p>
September 21-22, 1995<br>
Ala Moana Hotel<br>
410 Atkinson Drive<br>
Honolulu, Hawaii<br>
<p>

<p>
Introduction - Patrick Takahashi<br></b>
Dr. Takahashi opened the meeting by welcoming all and introducing Karl 
R bago, the Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Energy for the Office of Utility Technology.
<p>
<b>Hydrogen Programs within OUT - Karl R bago</b><br>
Mr. R bago acknowledged the significant progress the Hydrogen Program has 
made in realizing a hydrogen future.  Activities of the program have 
included the solicitation which is now being reviewed and the notice of 
interest which will lead to a solicitation in 1996.  Dr. Takahashi met 
with and presented the Green Hydrogen Report to Charles Curtis, the 
Deputy Secretary of Energy, and Christine Ervin, the Assistant Secretary 
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.   Mr. Curtis demonstrated a 
good understanding of the program and shared the same goal of using 
hydrogen as a dominant fuel of the future.  The Office of Utility 
Technologies remains committed to a solid hydrogen program. 
<p>
<b>Legislative Update - Mason Wiggins</b><br>
Speaking on behalf of Congressman Walker, Chairman of the House Science 
Committee, Mr.
Wiggins reported on legislative activities noting that the Hydrogen 
Future Act passed through the House and Senator Harkin s bill was 
introduced in the Senate co-sponsored by Senator Kyl of Arizona.  The 
House bill states that non-federal funding requirements may be reduced by 
the Secretary if deemed necessary and appropriate.  Mr. Walker agrees, if 
the Secretary finds the research basic or fundamental in nature.  He will 
also try to make sure that at least 5 percent of basic research funding 
will be used on alternative energy technologies.  Senator Burns has 
introduced the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Commercialization Act (S1155) to set 
aside money for a specific program at a specific place.  Mr. Walker is 
opposed to this proposal because he feels that it would interfere with 
the competition which has started for hydrogen research and development.  
His main concern is that money on the hydrogen program is spent on 
hydrogen basic research.  He would like a competitive
process for hydrogen projects and would support any ideas that HTAP would 
have to streamline such a process.  He believes that the federal 
government can fund basic and fundamental research, development and 
demonstration to the stage of finding out whether a concept works but not 
to the point of whether a concept works on a commercial basis.  His hope 
is to see the commercial sectoreventually take over the research projects 
and bring the technologies into commercialization.
<p>
<b>Report from USDOE - Russell Eaton</b><br>

Dr. Eaton presented an overview of the DOE Hydrogen Program beginning 
with recommendations

that were made at the last HTAP meeting.  These included integration of 
government research and

business interests and the competitive initiation of research projects.  
National labs will continue to

be a source of expertise and an important part of the program.  With 
respect to the Hydrogen Future

Act, the HTAP will submit to Congress recommendations on the 
effectiveness of the program and

related points.  Achievements in the program include industry/government 
cost sharing in the form

of cooperative agreements.  Florida Solar Energy Center received a 
patent on SPE materials for

electrolysis and four other patents have been disclosed or applied for.  
Among the many technical

accomplishments were the biological production of hydrogen using a 
single light reaction, 7 percent

conversion of solar to hydrogen at the University of Hawaii, 70% 
conversion efficiencies from Solar

Reactor Technologies, and the development of magnesium based alloy with 
increased storage

performance.  Working groups for production, storage, utilization and 
systems integration have been

established to foster technical interchange among industry and 
laboratory researchers.  A strategic

planning group has been formed to give recommendations on the direction 
and conduct of the

program.  Public outreach projects include a CD ROM showing the benefits 
of hydrogen and a

documentary film. An industry outreach workshop was held in June that 
resulted in recommendations

on various hydrogen issues including the federal role, the transition 
strategy, infrastructure

development and technology demonstrations.  



Dr. Linden raised the issue of a lack of strategic thrust in the current 
program.  In terms of strategic

alliance, he feels it s more important to work with other sources of 
funding for hydrogen

demonstration projects.  Because of the hydrogen program has limited 
money, there should be a

rigorous and more selective process.  He is very critical of the use of 
reformation of natural gas. 

Zero emission mass transit ought to be given the highest priority 
because of its high visibility and

promising application.
<p>
<b>Report on Hydrogen Program - Neil Rossmeissl</b><br>

In a presentation on programmatic aspects, Mr. Rossmeissl described the 
annual peer review

process and the collaboration between different offices of DOE.  The 
review panel is selected

through recommendation.  It consists of people with the broadest 
knowledge of projects and also

specialists. One recommendation that has been incorporated into the 
program is technical and

economic analysis.  A solicitation was send out to the national labs for 
R&D activity.  116 proposals

were received and reviewed.  The ranking of projects were prioritized 
based on those reviews. The

funding for the program will be split with the national labs receiving 
50% and universities and industry

receiving the balance.  Based on a recommendation by HTAP, a Notice of 
Interest (NOI) was

released in April.  The NOI was send out as a way of trying to get a 
handle on what types of projects

industry is interested in and how these fit into the program.  An 
outreach program has been

developed for industry and for the general public.  A comprehensive plan 
is being developed that will

be used as a point of measure for the program.  International activities 
include the collaboration

between the Japanese and the US for the care of Mitsui-McKinley marine 
collection.  The US was

elected as chairman of the International Energy Agency Hydrogen 
Implementation Agreement.  One

of the goals of the IEA is to begin cost shared research projects with 
different countries.  
<p>
<b>Report on NREL Hydrogen Program - Catherine Gregoire Padr¢</b><br>

The Notice of Interest (NOI) was send out to make a preliminary 
determination of the interest of state

agencies, universities, commercial organizations in forming 
collaborations to participate in research

and cost sharing.  There were 55 responses from 31 different states with 
83 ideas.  The next step

will be to look at cofunding of the development of business plans for 
those technology demonstration

and development projects. 



On the advisement of HTAP, four working groups in production, storage, 
utilization and system

integration have started.  These groups have been established to 
increase the industry participation

and interaction with the researchers and also to increase communications 
among the researchers

themselves.  The researchers will be presenting their activities to the 
rest of the group and

discussing project direction.  It was suggested that reports of these 
meetings be made available to

HTAP and to have a representative from HTAP on each of the groups.



Other activities include industry information exchange and transfer with 
NHA and the development 

a hydrogen home page on the Internet.  The page will be connected to the 
DOE page and possibly

to universities and other national labs.  
<p>
<b>Strategic Planning & Analysis - James Ohi</b><br>

A strategic planning group has been developed to address the issue of 
programmatic pathways;
long-term goals; and ways to meet these goals.  The group will consist 
of analysts who will report

to HTAP with recommendations on strategic issues that identify and 
coordinate programmatic

analysis needs.  The group members are Carol Bailey of HTAP and Enron, 
consultants Roberta

Nichols, David Crain, and Pat Grimes, Michael Koleda of Council on 
Alternate Fuels, Bob Moore of

Chevron Research & Technology, Michael Quah of Nafion DuPont and 
Shellandra K. Suman of

Northern States Power Company.  One particular function of the group is 
portfolio analysis to

determine what kind of measures or criteria should be used to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the

program (a cost benefit analysis).  They would also like to look at what 
determines technology risk

in relation to development programs.  HTAP agreed that a strategic 
planning function needs to be

filled and the recommendation was made to make this group a subcommittee 
of HTAP and charge

it with addressing strategic issues.  
<p>
<b>International Activities - Neil Rossmeissl</b><br>

Kings College has been voted in as the representative for England for 
the International Energy

Agency (IEA).  IEA Annex 10 which covers photoproduction of hydrogen has 
been approved.  Bulk

storage has been recommended but not approved.  The U.S. will operate 
Annex 11 which will look

at analysis of demonstration projects.  The executive committee has 
tasked the European Union to

draft a report on incorporating hydrogen into a commercial 
transportation vehicle.
<p>
<b>Report on Fuel Cells - Alan Lloyd/Pandit Patil</b><br>

Dr. Lloyd gave a presentation on fuel cells in southern California 
noting that air quality and the

California zero emission vehicle standards are significant drivers.  
Southern California Air Quality

Management District has supported DOE with the phosphoric acid fuel cell 
bus program and has

worked with the Ballard bus program and UC Riverside with some of their 
hydrogen programs.  They

created a renewable energy fuel cell implementation task force to try to 
accelerate the use of the

technology on both the transportation and stationary side.  



The primary goal of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles 
(PNGV) Initiative with DOE

is to develop within a decade a car that gets eighty miles to the gallon 
with the same performance,

size,  utility, and at a price that people are willing to pay.  The car 
must have fuel efficiencies up to

three times today s comparable vehicles.  A national fuel cell alliance 
has been established with

DOE, USCAR, GM, Chrysler and Ford.  A phosphoric acid fuel cell urban 
transit bus prototype is

under operational testing.  The barrier is the high cost of the fuel 
cells.  The focus of fuel cell R&D

is on performance, packaging and cost. Progress has been achieved in all 
areas with PEM fuel cell

light duty vehicles and the advanced reformer for fuel cell vehicles.  
Global competition in fuel cell

R&D is accelerating.  
<p>
<b>Industry Outreach - David Nahmias/Jon Hurwitch</b><br>

Twenty stakeholders meetings were held with twenty-six organizations to  
identify opportunities for

companies to increase industry participation in the Hydrogen Program.  A 
workshop was held in June

entitled Implementing Hydrogen Energy Systems; Industry and Government 
Partnerships with 110

participants.  The workshop increased industry s awareness of the 
Hydrogen Program and increased

the program s awareness to industry s interest and needs relative to the 
program.  It promoted

participation in the program by some companies that were not previously 
involved.  New areas of

mutual technology were identified.  One of the findings was that the 
petroleum industry is the largest

single user of hydrogen today.  They view hydrogen as a utility rather 
than a fuel and their only

interest is that improved technologies could lower the cost of hydrogen 
and lower their production

costs.  There is very strong fuel cell interest on the part of several 
companies.  The auto companies

tend to be skeptical about near to mid-term prospects for hydrogen 
vehicles, although the most

promising early market opportunity may be urban bus fleets.



There is a realization that if hydrogen energy markets are going to be 
achieved, it is going a take a

major effort by both the government and private sector.  There are 
near-term business opportunities

for companies to pursue.  The private sector needs incentives to 
participate and lead the effort to

get the products to the marketplace.  This can be done through funding 
R&D,  zero emission vehicle

mandates, and tax incentives.  The objectives of the outreach program 
are to promote opportunity

for industrial participation and issue clear focused communications from 
the Hydrogen Program;

create forums for technical interchange between government and industry; 
coordinate with regulatory

authorities to allow for safely operated hydrogen applications; and 
improve public perception of

hydrogen as a clean, safe form of energy.  Communications with 
stakeholders would be increased

with follow-on meetings and the initiation of trade publications.  
Market transformation is underway

with the creation of    technical working groups, specific partnership 
models, and assistance with

codes and standards.  A hydrogen trade show exhibit would be created for 
use at professional and

civic meetings.
<p>
<b>Public Outreach - Amy Baker/Rajat Sen</b><br>

The initial focus of this project will be primarily students and 
secondly the public at large.  The

strategy is to first determine the age group and type of technical 
information to be presented. 

Educational consultants would help to develop a curriculum and 
framework.  Once the materials are

developed, a series of field tests would be conducted.  Information 
would be presented to students

in a standard curriculum format with teachers  manuals, workbooks, CD 
ROM and videos.  Three

treatments for a hydrogen documentary targeted at the nine to fourteen 
year old group have been

developed and are being reviewed by DOE.  Other proposed activities 
include the creation of a

consortium of education and industry participants to support and guide 
public outreach and help with

cost sharing.  Trade shows, municipal and national meetings could be 
accessed by developing a

modular traveling exhibit with display materials, hydrogen energy system 
models, an interactive

multi-media center, and some video capability.  It is recommended that 
all of the public outreach that

is being done in the hydrogen community be coordinated.  HTAP will be 
asked to review the

prototypes for all of the projects as they come along.  Mr. R bago 
commented that the cost involved

in producing a stand-alone CD would be extremely high and felt the 
public outreach activities should

be focused on a reasonable level of information with a reasonable and 
integrated level of effort.
<p><b>Demonstration Committee - Alan Lloyd</b><br>

The committee decided that a demonstration of the hydrogen fuel cell was 
deemed appropriate

because both the cost and size are coming down.  The cost aspect and 
difficulty of getting full

hydrogen infrastructure would allow for the use of hydrogen from fossil 
fuels.  The transit sector may

be a good starting point.  Aircraft should continue to be encouraged.  
The possibility of lawn and

garden equipment was considered with batteries, fuel cells or hybrids.  
Integrated demonstrations

would provide technology enhancement and assessment, technology 
transfer, infrastructure support

and development.  The hydrogen corridor concept integrates southern 
California demonstrations of

production, storage, transport and utilization with stationary and 
mobile application and near to long

term technologies.  Dr. Linden suggested that the committee concentrate 
on demonstrations where

hydrogen is visible.  Dr. Birk suggested integrating the stationary with 
the mobile with electrolysis.
<p>
<b>Technology Advancement - Mounir Kamal</b><br>

The objective of this committee was to develop a set of requirements 
based on market and customer
expectations for transportation vehicles and assess current hydrogen 
technology in vehicle

applications with conventional and alternative propulsion vehicles.  It 
was concluded that hydrogen

vehicles cannot compete with conventional vehicles with current 
technology.   The focus of the

Hydrogen Program should be on niche market applications such as 
government and utility company

fleets.  Hydrogen vehicles must compete with electric and CNG vehicles.  
R&D and demonstrations

programs should focus on the hydrogen vehicle operating affordability, 
the driving range, and the

refueling infrastructure.  Safety is not an attribute to be considered 
because it cannot be

compromised; it is an absolute requirement.  
<p>
<b>Sustainable Energy R&D Centers - David Nahmias</b><br>

Senator Harkin was approached with the idea of putting the issue of 
sustainable energy centers into

the Hydrogen Future Act; he declined to do so.  He felt that the bill 
had an upward fight to be

approved and that another requirement could lessen the changes of its 
success.  A center initiative

is taking place at Savannah River with an emphasis on market needs and 
commercialization. 

Rocketdyne Energy Technology and Engineering Center is advertising 
testing services for hydrogen

devices.  The hydrogen corridor in southern California is a continuing 
effort that supports

demonstrations over a long period of time.  A city of the future is 
being proposed in Canada where

hydrogen applications would be demonstrated.  The recommendations are 
that HTAP does not have

to take a lead in forming centers and that the centers can be both for 
basic R&D and for

demonstrations leading to commercialization.  If there is DOE funding 
for these centers, public

awareness should be an added requirement.
<p>   
<b>Friday, September 22, 1995</b>
<p>
<b>Transition - Patrick Takahashi</b><br>

In order to make the transition for the election of the next HTAP 
chairman smoother, Dr. Takahashi 

recommended that a vice chairman be selected with the idea that the vice 
chair is in line to be the

next chair.  Dr. Lloyd was nominated and elected as vice chairman.  



Dr. Takahashi suggested that HTAP hold a meeting in Stuttgart in 
conjunction with the World

Hydrogen Energy Conference.  There may be a problem with having a public 
hearing where the

American public could have difficulty attending, but the matter will be 
discussed with DOE.  The next

HTAP meeting will be held in Alexandria, VA at the Radisson Hotel in 
April.
<p>
<b>Round Table Discussion</b></br>

Dr. Takahashi reported that the Green Hydrogen Report was well received 
by Christine Ervin and

Charles Curtis.  Mr. R bago told the panel that although DOE did not 
delegate its policy formulations

based on the report, they do endorse and agree with the vision of HTAP 
and look to HTAP for

guidance on the structure of the hydrogen program for long term goals 
and steps to get there.  Dr.

Takahashi has plans to also meet with staff members or members of key 
committees in the House

to pass on the Green Hydrogen Report, discuss issues and establish a 
communications bond.  A

list of people to potentially meet with on the Senate side has been 
drawn up.  It was suggested that

the report be personally delivered or distributed to renewable energy 
industry groups, state energy

offices, the National Academy of Engineering, the Environmental 
Protection Agency and other

appropriate parties.



The ISO Working Group 3 is preparing a hydrogen fuel specification. 
Working Groups 1 & 2 are

looking at container specifications and they are going to address 
compressed hydrogen storage as

well.  NHA held a codes and standards workshop.  Given the focus on 
liquid hydrogen by ISO, the

emphasis on a codes and standards effort to support hydrogen might best 
be on gaseous storage. 

It was determined that the best way to start is by building on the 
natural gas codes and standards

that exit today.  
<p>
<b>Public Comments</b><br>

Dr. Larry Berg and Bob Fleming presented an overview of Ballard 
projects.  The Ballard hydrogen

bus was completed in 1992 and brought to Los Angeles in 1994 where it 
ran at the Los Angeles

International Airport from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 for a week.  There 
was no negative feedback from

the public in riding a hydrogen powered vehicle; the reaction was 
enthusiastic.  Phase 2 bus was just

completed and shown in Chicago.  This  is a forty foot bus with 250 
kilowatt and 275 horsepower fuel

cell.  The hydrogen is stored on the top as in a natural gas vehicle.  
The fuel cell can be removed

in approximately fifteen minutes,  which the transit district mechanics 
found to be  attractive.  The

first test fleet will be three buses, possibly five.  The commercial 
production bus is scheduled for

1998.  Ballard and Diamond Vans will unveil a utility van with a 
hydrogen powered fuel cell in January

1996.  The work with Diamond is implemented by the partnership that 
Ballard has with General

Motors under the DOE Fuel Cell Program.  Ballard has activities 
involving ships with a strategic

partnership with HFW in Germany and is looking at a submarine program in 
North America.  They

also are in equity partnership with Johnson Mabley.  Ballard is in the 
process of setting up a facility

in southern California.  There are a variety of requirements related to 
the use and storage of

hydrogen in the area with which they are being forced to deal.  The bus 
projects are used for public

awareness and Dr. Berg believes that the public does not really care 
what fuel is used.  They are

concerned with cost, performance, and availability and that is the way 
that hydrogen should be sold

to the public.
<p>

William Summers of the Westinghouse Savannah River Technology Center 
discussed the hydrogen

bus project being developed with a number of regional partners including 
the City of Atlanta, Georgia

Power Company, Georgia Technical Research Institute and the Bluebird Bus 
Company.  It will be

a 33 foot, 32 passenger hybrid bus with an electric drive system, 
onboard metal hydride storage and

an IC engine generator set.  It will have a 60 kilowatt output from the 
generator set and a 230

horsepower electric motor.  They are projecting performance equal to a 
diesel bus, equivalent miles

per gallon of two times the diesel bus, and near zero emissions.  Design 
range is 150 miles; the

typical city bus operating range is 120 miles per day.  A refueling 
station based on the use of off-

peak electrolysis will be built.  Metal hydride storage will be used and 
the hydrogen will be transferred

from the stationary metal hydride beds to the on-board beds.  Savannah 
River considers this bus to

be a systems integration, technology validation project as well as a 
public awareness tool.   It will

operate in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and for 
at least a year in normal

city bus service in Atlanta.  
<p>

Gary Noland of G & A Associates discussed fuel cells for the Olympics, 
an activity that has been

formed by Bob Rose to use the Olympics  to showcase U.S. technologies in 
fuel cells and in storage

and the use of hydrogen as a clean fuel.  The proposal is to provide 
electrical power to the

whitewater kayaking event in the hills of Tennessee.  The primary user 
of the power will be the

Olympic Broadcasting Group who is responsible for all transmission of 
event coverage.  The

Southface Energy Institute, Energy and Environmental Resources Center 
will construct a 6200

square feet structure to showcase environmentally sound technologies.  
There are opportunities for

industry, particularly the hydrogen production industry to participate 
in these endeavors.  Atlanta

wants to become a showplace for solar energy and this would be the 
opportunity to demonstrate the

advantage of using hydrogen as a storage medium for the solar energy 
that is produced.  The

biggest obstacle is funding the siting operation with fuel cells.  
<p>

Dr. Zweig of the South Coast Air Quality Management District discussed 
the serious pollution

problems of the district, which consists of four counties in southern 
California.  The pollutant levels

of ozone have decreased by about 50 percent from 1976 to 1994 in the 
area but the levels still

exceed the federal standards for ozone.  A more serious health hazard is 
PM 10s or particulate

matter in the Riverside area.  This has caused higher incidences of 
cancer, chronic pulmonary

disease and  increased deaths according to an American Cancer Society 
study.  People are suffering

from fossil fuel combustion health problems that cannot be remedied 
without the escalation of the

implementation of hydrogen.  Some projects have been started including 
the Hydrogen Corridor 

under way in El Segundo. A manual has been produced and is available 
that covers all of the

obstacles and hurdles that were overcome to get the Hydrogen Corridor 
started.  There is an

ongoing project with UCR to make hydrogen from a small solar hydrogen 
plant.  Palm Desert will be

converting golf carts to fuel cells and using photovoltaics and wind for 
producing hydrogen.  Dr.

Zweig thanked the panel and everyone involved with hydrogen for all the 
progress that has been

made and encouraged everyone to make more and do it faster.
<p>
<b>Closing Remarks<br></b>

In closing comments, Mr. Hainsselin encouraged a strong bond between OTT 
and OUT to develop

some kind of blueprint for hydrogen-fueled vehicles as a next step.  Dr. 
Birk recommended that the 

strategic plan enhance the technoeconomic and environmental motivations 
for moving toward

hydrogen; to state the goal clearly and not to consider the limitation 
of money but rather see what

the plan is, figure what out it costs, and then propose that.  Mr. 
Rossmeissl tasked the panel to look at some of the bigger issues and 
decide how to address them as a panel and provide

recommendations to DOE.  Dr. Kamal would like to see a little more 
balance in the agenda between

information presentation and decision making discussions, with more time 
devoted to discussion. 

Dr. Linden expressed concern in reforming diesel fuel and liquid 
hydrocarbons and hoped that

progress will be made in on-board hydrogen storage.  Mr. Nahmias called 
for participation in the

industry outreach plan and ideas with regard to hydrogen energy centers.  

<p>

Dr. Takahashi thanked all of the participants and adjourned the 
proceedings at 11:40 a.m.
