<B>Company Overview</B><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Geron Corporation is the first biopharmaceutical company to focus exclusively on the development of therapeutic products for diseases of aging, including cancer. Geron's ability to address a diversity of age-related disease states is based on insights into the fundamental biological mechanisms of cellular aging - and conversely, into the process by which cancer cells escape "aging" by becoming "immortal".<P>
Geron believes that many diseases of aging are due primarily to genetically programmed aging, or senescence, of cells in the various bodily tissues. Geron and its collaborators have pioneered the understanding of the genetic "clock" of cellular senescence. The clocking mechanism consists of Telomeres -- repeated DNA sequences found at the ends of chromosomes. telomeres shorten each time a cell divides until they reach a critically short length which is associated with the onset of cell senescence. At the opposite extreme, the age-related disease of cancer occurs because of the failure of cells to senesce owing to mutations that confer replicative immortality.<P>

Geron's research programs seek to intervene with the fundamental mechanisms underlying age-related disease through modulation of cell senescence. Further, Geron seeks to develop therapeutics to treat cancer by inhibiting the immortalizing enzyme telomerase.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        <tr><th align=center>Program<th>Description<th>Disease Target
        <tr><td align=left>Telomerase Inhibition<td>Induce cell death by inhibiting the enzyme telomerase, restoring tumor cell's normal biological "clock"<td>Cancer therapeutics and diagnostics

<B>Investors:</B>
Geron has raised over $30 million to-date from leading private investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Venrock Associates, CW Group, Oxford Venture Partners, Domain Associates, and Biotechnology Investments, Ltd.<P>

<B>Founded:</B>  1992<P>

<B>Corporate partnering opportunities:</B><BR>
Geron is currently searching for a pharmaceutical partner in the U.S. and Europe for telomerase inhibition for cancer, and worldwide, in senescent gene expression for age-related disease. Geron is also interested in developing a relationship with a diagnostics company for telomerase diagnostics in Europe and Japan.<P>
