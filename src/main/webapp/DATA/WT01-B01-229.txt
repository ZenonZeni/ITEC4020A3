<HR>
If you are in good academic standing and you are inquisitive,
adventuresome and motivated, we encourage you to apply. You should
be eager to learn in a challenging environment that stresses cooperation,
sensitivity to others, and adaptability to changing conditions.
NO SAILING EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY.
<P>
You must have completed one college-level laboratory science course
or its equivalent for admission to SEA Semester. Advanced Placement
(AP) science courses successfully completed during high school
may satisfy this requirement. If you are a high school graduate
and have deferred admission to college, you are eligible to apply
provided you have met SEA's science course requirement.
<P>
SEA does not require a specific academic major or GPA for admission;
however, you must have the motivation and emotional maturity necessary
for a demanding academic load and intensive schedule of classes
and labs on shore. Coursework assumes college sophomore-level
competence. While at sea, you must be able to live without the
amenities of home.
<P>
SEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or sexual preference,
religion, color, creed, national origin, marital or parental status
in the admission of students, the recruitment or employment of
faculty, and the operation of any program or activity as specified
by federal and state laws and regulations.
<P>
<B>To receive an application package, please call the Admission
Office at 1-800-552-3633.</B><HR>

<H3>Financial Assistance</H3>

<P>
Financial assistance is available for SEA Semester. SEA's own
grants and interest-free loans are awarded <I><B>based on need</B></I>.
Several special, <I><B>non-need-based scholarships</B></I> are
also awarded each year.
<P>
Determination of need-based financial aid is made <I>after</I>
acceptance; applying for assistance will in no way affect your
chances for admission. We urge you to apply for aid if your personal,
family and institutional resources cannot meet the full cost of
an SEA program.
<P>
Federal aid programs are applicable to SEA. Some colleges allow
students to transfer aid packages directly to SEA.
<P>
Our financial aid office will gladly discuss the resources available
to you, and will work closely with you to try to find ways to
make SEA Semester a reality for you. We are in frequent touch
with the financial aid offices at many colleges and universities.
If you are planning to apply to SEA Semester, you should talk
first to a financial aid officer at your home institution and
find out what assistance your school can provide. Inform your
officer that you may be off campus so that federal aid will be
transferred properly.
<P>
If you have any questions about financial aid, call SEA's <B>Office
of Financial Assistance</B>, toll-free:<B> 1-800-552-3633</B>
