<h2>CPJ presents legal brief in trial of satiric Croatian newsweekly</h2>

By Amanda Onion<br>
<P>
A criminal trial against two journalists accused of defaming Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in the satirical newspaper <CITE><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../../../news/cro6.14.html">Feral Tribune</A></CITE>&nbsp; was unexpectedly adjourned on its opening day, June 14. The judge adjourned the trial until Sept. 25 in order to call new witnesses, he said.<P>

The move was hailed by observers as a victory for the defense and a response to the international outcry over President Tudjman&#146;s efforts to muzzle Croatia&#146;s independent media.<P>

<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.webworld.org/feral/"><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT img width=80 height=80 no border SRC="ftonline.jpeg"></A>The charges against Viktor Ivancic, <CITE><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.webworld.org/feral">Feral Tribune's</a></cite> editor in chief, and Marinko Culic, a reporter with the weekly, stem from an April 29 article criticizing the president&#146;s proposal to rebury the remains of World War II Fascists alongside their victims. If convicted, the journalists face up to three years in prison.<P>

CPJ board member James C. Goodale, an attorney and expert on press freedom issues, traveled to Zagreb to present the judge with a legal brief, prepared at the request of defense counsel. The CPJ brief condemned the prosecution, which is based on the notion of seditious libel, or the criminalization of slander against public officials, a legal concept that the Committee characterized as " fundamentally antithetical to the values of a democratic society." Since there are no procedures in the Croatian legal system to file such documents, however, the judge was unable to enter the brief into the record. <P>

The case against Ivancic and Culic is the first application of a law passed by the Croatian parliament on March 29, which effectively criminalizes any critical reporting or satirical commentary on the president, the prime minister, the parliament speaker, or the chief magistrates of the supreme and constitutional courts.<P>

After the hearing, Goodale and other representatives from press freedom groups and local NGOs held a public meeting and press conference in Zagreb, where they denounced the statutes used to prosecute the journalists and cited international practice regarding criminal libel.<P>

The Croatian laws being used to prosecute Ivancic and Culic " have no place in any country, and are especially to be condemned in a self-proclaimed democracy such as Croatia," notes CPJ&#146;s brief, which was distributed at the press conference. "No journalist in any Western democracy is in prison as a result of a conviction of seditious libel." <P>

The CPJ brief extensively documents the opinions of the highest courts in Western democracies that the concept of seditious libel is an unacceptable constraint on freedom of expression. Croatia&#146;s new statutes are an example of seditious libel laws because they shield only high government officials from   criticism. <br>
