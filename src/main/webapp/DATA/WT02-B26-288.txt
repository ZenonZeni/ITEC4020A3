<HR NOSHADE>

Krebs sits at the back of the sled, tired and happy to be pulled
along by the noisy snowmobile. Its high-pitched whine breaks the 
serenity of the frozen lake in Canada's North. But Krebs loves it,
the crisp quiet cold, the wide open whiteness. Wind and snow spray
his face as they plow through a snow drift. For Krebs it's a 
childhood dream come true. As a kid in Illinois, he read every book 
in the library about exploring the North Pole. He was fascinated
by the mysteries of the North. Did lemmings really commit mass
suicide jumping off cliffs? Now here he was, finding
out for himself.

<P>

Krebs thinks about the morning as the sled swooshes along
over bumps and cracks in the ice. With him are four ecology students
from UBC, two riding in front of him on the sled loaded
with research equipment, and two up front on the snowmobile.
They are returning from a 6 hour session tagging snowshoe hares
on a remote island in Kluane Lake in South West Yukon Territory.
It's early May, 1980. Working in teams, they had just finished 
checking traps on a grid covering the island. These traps don't
hurt the rabbits. Every rabbit was weighed, sexed, and
if they didn't already have one, they got an ID tag in their ears.
The researchers kept meticulous notes on clipboards.

<P>

Krebs is satisfied. He's thinking about how this new data fits into a
paper he's working on when suddenly the student driving the snowmobile
yells, "Hold on guys," and revs the engine to jump across a crack
in the ice. The lake is starting to break up with the Spring thaw
and they have crossed a few of these cracks already. The snowmobile
makes it across, but it opens the crack too much. Before
he knows it, Krebs, the sled, and the two other students are sinking
fast in icy water. It doesn't help that they're all wearing winter
parkas and heavy snow boots, either. Krebs treads water with one hand
and holds the data notebooks up with the other yelling, "Save the
data! Save the data!!"

<P>

They did save the data, and themselves, fortunately, but his students
never let Krebs forget that day.
Data's hard to come by when you are a wildlife biologist like 
Krebs. You don’t do much work in a comfortable laboratory. Your lab is the
great outdoors and since animal life cycles take years, you need
decades of observations and data collection to understand a particular
animal. Even after about 50 years of research, we still don't know exactly 
why populations of lemmings in the North seem to disappear about every
four years. But one thing for sure, we know they do not jump off cliffs.
<P>

<B>History</B><BR>

Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis,
Missouri. As a kid he remembers fishing for catfish in local rivers with
his grandfather. Charley admired his grandfather and his tales of natural
adventures and wildlife. In particular Krebs was drawn to the Canadian Arctic.
At 8 years old he wanted to be a forest ranger. Even then, he was reading
books about basic ecology and the science of wild animals. All through
his high school years, Krebs had the most amazing summer job. He worked
for a St. Louis fur trading company harvesting seals in the Berring Sea.
Each Summer he went by train 3 days to Seattle, then by boat 7 days up
the coast to these uninhabited Northern islands. Krebs loved it, and he
was curious about all the wildlife on the islands. It's probably because
of these teenage trips that he has become one of the world experts on
Northern animals like lemmings and snowshoe hares.

<P>

After getting his bachelors degree from the U. of Minnesota (1957), Krebs
came to Vancouver, BC to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the
world expert on lemmings. Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a PhD (62) in Zoology
from UBC. Then, after a 2-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home
to teach Zoology at the of Indiana University. But in 1970 Krebs returned 
to Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC.

<P>

Krebs' textbook called "Ecology" published by Harper-Collins and
now in its fourth edition is used worldwide as the standard teaching
text for ecology courses.

<HR NOSHADE>

Zoology is the study of animals. Krebs is an animal ecologist. 
Ecology is a combination of physiology--the study of the internal
workings of an animal's body--genetics, evolution, and behaviour.
Krebs has spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of
lemmings and other small Northern mammals whose populations crash
regularly every four to ten years. Hudson's Bay fur trading records
show these fluctuations stretching back for hundreds of years.<P>

In 1965 Krebs tried a simple experiment in an Indiana pasture. 
He simply fenced in an area of grassland the size of a soccer field to see
what would happen to the population of voles living inside the fence.
(The fence extends down into the soil several inches to stop tunneling.)
Amazingly, within a year, he found the population
of voles increased about 5 times. Krebs has spent his working life
trying to explain the "Krebs effect". He says, "You just put a fence up.
You don't do anything to the animals. So what is the fence doing?"
<P>
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/krebs_science.gif>

<P>

1. Lemmings are small rodents that look like guinea pigs. They live
throughout the world in Northern latitudes. Every 4 years their
population increases up to 500 times and then crashes to almost nothing.

<P>

2. The "Fence Effect" also known as the "Krebs Effect" demonstrated
here on Westham Island, BC. A population explosion on the left side
fenced in area has occurred and the voles have eaten everything except
the thistles.

<P>

3. Graph showing the population explosion and crash caused by the fence.
The gray line is for voles in a similar unfenced area. The black line
shows the number of voles over time in the fenced area.

<P>

4. Aggression in voles. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated
possible reasons for the Fence Effect. Food is not a factor. You can supply
the fenced in area with unlimited food, and the effect is still observed.
Predators are not the answer. You can make the fence low enough to keep the
voles in but let predators like foxes in. The fence is never a deterrent
for birds of prey like hawks, yet you still see the Fence Effect. Krebs now
believes that the effect is due to social behaviour among the voles. This
includes the natural genetic selection for more aggressive individuals over
the time as living conditions become more crowded. The final crash
seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babies
in neighbouring nests.

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Objective:<P>

<UL>

<LI> To learn about animals by following their tracks

</UL>


You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> A trip to the countryside

<LI> A notebook


</UL>

What to do:<P>

<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     

Summer: <BR>
Go to any large grassy field such as those outside most airports,
and literally put your nose to the ground. Part the grass and inch
along parting it in a straight line for at least 10 meters or until
you find a vole runway. It will be an unmistakable runway about
2 or 3 cm wide like the inside of a toilet paper roll. They are like
curving tubes at the bottoms of the grass stems right near where the
stems join the roots. If you don't 
find one on the first try, try again, maybe in a different field.
The runways curve and branch in all directions. Try to draw a map
of the vole runs in a small area of the field.
<P>
Winter: <BR>
If you are in Canada, you probably live somewhere near a spruce forest.
Go cross country skiing or hiking in the forest looking for snowshoe
hare tracks. They look like this:
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/krebs_tracks.gif>
Once you learn to spot the tracks, follow a set and try to determine
what the hare is eating. You can examine their droppings or look
for bits of food the hare dropped while eating. Is there lots of food?
Where is it located? Where do snowshoe hares like to hang out? How
do they avoid predators like lynx and other wildcats?
<P>
If you want to get a feeling for what Charles Krebs does, try to 
count the number of hare tracks that cross your path in a set 
distance, say about 100 meters. Write this in your notebook and
return to the exact same 100 meter stretch next year to count the
number of tracks that cross the path. Repeat this for at least 10
years. Can you see a cycle begin to emerge?

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Mystery</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Krebs has still not figured out the mystery of the fence effect entirely, but
one thing he would like to know is: how big does a fenced in area have to be
until the Fence Effect dissappears?
