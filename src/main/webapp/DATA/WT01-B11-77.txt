        <h2>Kansas City Satellite </h2>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf - Kansas City is
        dedicated to teaching hearing impaired children to listen
        and to speak. The school gives these children and their
        parents a beneficial option -- the gifts of speech and a
        mainstream education which the auditory/oral method
        offers. </p>
        <p>Enrollment is open to children in Missouri, Kansas and
        surrounding states without regard to race, religion,
        gender or financial means. </p>

        Early Intervention</strong></a> </p>
        <p>The diagnosis of an infant's deafness is a most
        painful time for parents, but also the time of greatest
        hope. The earlier a child's residual hearing is
        stimulated by speech, the faster and further language
        will progress. </p>
        <p>This is why St. Joseph's offers a specialized early
        intervention Parent-Child program. As we support and
        counsel parents in coping with their child's diagnosis,
        we also guide them in their role as the child's first and
        most important teachers of language. </p>
        <p>For toddlers up to approximately age 2 1/2, parents
        and child together attend individual one-hour sessions
        one or more times a week. Through social, motor and
        cognitive activities, parents learn to assist in
        developing their child's auditory/verbal skills in the
        home. </p>
        <p>&#160; </p>
        <p><a name="Nursery Class"><strong>Nursery Class</strong></a> </p>
        <p>A three morning a week nursery class offers children
        ages 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 a fun and effective combination of
        activities to stimulate their development. In small
        classes, they develop group interaction experiences while
        enjoying age appropriate activities. Part of the day
        includes individual speech and listening therapy for each
        child. </p>
        <p>&#160; </p>
        <p><a name="Preschool"><strong>Preschool</strong></a> </p>
        <p>Academic , language and developmental class activities
        of an age-appropriate level are conducted in a full-day,
        five day a week preschool program. The preschool
        generally enrolls children between the ages of 3 1/2 and
        5. Inclusion of children slightly younger or older is
        considered, based upon individual evaluations. </p>
        <p>As socialization, motor and cognitive skills continue
        to develop, the children advance into a more concentrated
        academic and speech program. The curriculum is designed
        to prepare them for kindergarten and primary classrooms,
        either in the mainstream or in a dedicated deaf-education
        setting. </p>

        <p><a name="Cochlear Implant Rehabilitation"><strong>Cochlear
        Implant Rehabilitation</strong></a> </p>
        <p>Educational and speech rehabilitation therapy is
        offered on an individual basis for cochlear implanted
        children of all grade school ages. As a pioneer in the
        development of post-implant language therapy, St.
        Joseph's program offers a level of expertise and
        experience unsurpassed in the nation. </p>
        <p>Through phonetic discrimination and auditory
        comprehension drills, therapists teach implanted students
        how to decode newly available sounds and translate them
        into improved speech and language. </p>
        <p>Private therapy sessions of one-half hour to an hour
        are offered by appointment during regular hours or after
        school. </p>
