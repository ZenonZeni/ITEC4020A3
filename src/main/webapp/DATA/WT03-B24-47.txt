a thesis for up to 6 hours of elective credit.
<P>
<STRONG>Students may earn a Certificate in Software Systems Engineering by replacing the
INFS 622 core course with SWSE 620, and by taking the following SWSE courses as
electives:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>SWSE 619  Software Construction
<LI>SWSE 621  Software Design
<LI>SWSE 623  Formal Methods and Models in Software Engineering
<LI>SWSE 625  Software Project Management
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> that <B>SWSE 620</B> should not be taken as an elective unless the student is
replacing INFS 622 as a part of the Software Systems Certificate program.  Credit
will not be given for taking both INFS 622 and SWSE 620; only three hours of
credit will be awarded.
