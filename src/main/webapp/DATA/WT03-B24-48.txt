<P>
Before the beginning of each semester, the ISSE department holds an orientation
meeting to advise incoming and continuing students.  Members of the faculty are
present to answer questions and to offer advice concerning programs of study. 
Course registration forms are signed at this time; however, a student may enroll
ahead of the orientation meeting with Departmental approval and signature.
<P>
The department also provides an advising function to students, as outlined in the
Student Advising Form available from the department.  Each student is assigned
a faculty advisor with whom the student may confer regarding queries of a
technical nature.  A Plan of Study form for the MS-SWSE degree should be
completed and submitted by the student soon after admission to the program.  
The plan serves as a planning guide for the student.
