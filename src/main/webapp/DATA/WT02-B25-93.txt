<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>Luvox (fluvoxamine maleate) is a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) marketed jointly by Solvay Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., and the Upjohn Company. Luvox has recently been cleared for marketing
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD), a biological illness involving an
imbalance of a brain chemical. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What does Luvox treat?</b></font></p>

<p>Luvox has been shown to effectively reduce the symptoms
associated with OCD, an anxiety disorder affecting an estimated
five million Americans. OCD is characterized by obsessions
(unwanted, recurrent and disturbing thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive,
ritualized behaviors that the person feels driven to perform in
order to lessen the anxiety produced by the obsessions).</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>How does Luvox work?</b></font></p>

<p>Current theories suggest that OCD is a biological illness
which may involve an imbalance of a naturally occurring brain chemical
called serotonin, which sends impulses from one nerve cell to another. Luvox
seems to work by improving this imbalance and by reducing the
obsessions and compulsions associated with OCD.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Who can benefit from Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>Physicians and the millions of Americans with OCD have, with
Luvox, a new option in drug treatment. Patients who have not benefitted
previously from medication may respond to Luvox. It may also be
useful as a medication to try first with persons with OCD.</p>

<p>Studies show that Luvox is effective for elderly patients as
well as young persons. The safety and effectiveness of Luvox have not
been established for those under 18 years of age. Luvox should be used cautiously
in patients with a history of mania and/or seizures. Nursing
mothers and women who become pregnant during therapy with Luvox
should consult a physician about continuing treatment.</p>

<p>A recent nationwide survey of more than 1,000 adults found
that over half of the respondents were not aware that medications
exist to treat OCD. Luvox represents a new choice in drug therapy
that may help to clear up this misperception and increase the
number of people being successfully treated for OCD.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is the standard dose of Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>The recommended starting dose for Luvox is 50 mg, taken as a
single daily dose at bedtime. The dosage may be increased in 50
mg increments every four to seven days until maximum therapeutic benefit
is achieved. The dosage should never exceed 300 mg/day.</p>

<p>For doses over 100 mg/day, it is recommended that Luvox be
given in two divided doses. If the doses are unequal, the larger
dose should be given at bedtime. Try to be patient the first few
weeks of treatment. Improvement may occur only after several
weeks or months.</p>

<p>It may be necessary for physicians to modify the initial dose
and subsequent dosage increases for older patients.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Can I take Luvox with other
medications?</b></font></p>

<p>There are several medications that should not be taken in
combination with Luvox. These medications include the
prescription antihistamines Seldane and Hismanal as well as any
MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) medication, such as Parnate, Nardil,
or Marplan. Patients should notify their physicians if they are
taking or plan to take any other medications with Luvox because
there is a potential for harmful interactions. It is also
advisable to avoid alcohol while undergoing treatment with Luvox.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>How long should I stay on Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>The effectiveness of Luvox for long-term use has not been
studied extensively. Therefore, patients taking this drug for extended
periods of time should be monitored closely by a physician and re-evaluated
over time.</p>
