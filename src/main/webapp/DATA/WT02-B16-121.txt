<p><font size=+2>P</font>hotovoltaic (or PV) systems convert light energy into electricity.  The term "photo" is a stem
from the Greek "phos," which means "light."  "Volt" is named for Alessandro Volta 
(1745-1827), a pioneer in the study of electricity.  "Photo-voltaics," then, could literally mean "light-
electricity."  Most commonly known as "solar cells," PV systems are already an important part
of our lives.  The simplest systems power many of the small calculators and wrist watches we
use every day.  More complicated systems provide electricity for pumping water, powering
communications equipment, and even lighting our homes and running our appliances.  In a
surprising number of cases, PV power is the cheapest form of electricity for performing these
tasks.

<p>Here, we describe the PV effect that allows various <a href="materials.html">materials</a> to 
<a href="turning.html">produce electricity</a> from sunlight; show
how PV cells, modules, and arrays are made; explain why PV is the <a href="whyuse.html">most
logical power choice</a> in many different cases; and provide 
<a href="applications.html">real examples</a> of how this science is improving the 
lives of people all over the world!
