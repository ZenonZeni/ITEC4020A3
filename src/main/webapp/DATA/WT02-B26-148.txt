McGraw-Hill, a leading publisher of marketing and environmental management
books, commissioned Walter Coddington in 1992 to write a comprehensive,
experience-based textbook on environmental marketing.  <I>Environmental
Marketing</I> is a hands-on guide to environmental marketing, strategic
planning, consumer research, regulations, product certification, product
design and positioning, strategic marketing alliances, effective communication
strategies, and much more. The book has received &quot;must read&quot; reviews
from the marketing media around the world and can be found in marketing
classrooms in cultures as diverse as Northern California and South Korea.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No company is squeaky clean, and few products (that work!) are squeaky
clean. But improvements, necessitated by increasing regulations and envi-ronmental
awareness, are being made and should be promoted. Consumers must be educated
about the advantages to their health and the health of the environment through
cleaner products, especially if they are expected to support the tremendous
industry investment in cleaner technology.&quot;<BR>
