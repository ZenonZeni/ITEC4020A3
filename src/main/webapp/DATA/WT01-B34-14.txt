<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization - US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Nine: Legal Issues Surrounding the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>This chapter deals not with an argument of the legalizers per
se, but instead their implicit belief </p>

<p>that legalizing drugs would not have a profound effect on
other facets of law and public policy. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Basically, we have three concerns here. </p>

<p>First, can drug use be used as a defense in criminal or civil
proceedings? That is, can a person </p>

<p>accused of a hit-and-run accident escape liability by noting
to the court that he was on cocaine at the time? </p>

<p>Second, what will be done with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)? As its name suggests, the FDA is
responsible for testing the safety of food and drugs in the
United States. For example, the FDA banned the use of Red Dye #2
a number of years ago because it caused cancer (this is why there
were no red M+M's in most of the 1980's - it was not until the
candy producer came up with a noncarcenogenic dye that they
started making them again in the late 1980's). Similarly, the FDA
banned the use of the substance known as Laetrile when it
determined that this supposed drug had absolutely no
pharmacological effects. But if we allow the legal sale of drugs
such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP - that unquestionably
are dangerous - how can we justify allowing the FDA to exercise
quality control over any other type of drugs? To allow the sale
and use of cocaine while still granting the FDA power to
regulate, say, food additives such as saccharine is like banning
slingshots but allowing people to carry automatic assault rifles.
So if we legalize the sale and use of clearly dangerous drugs, it
seems that to be logically consistent we would have to close down
the FDA and let everyone have access to every type of drug. And
given legalized drugs it also seems hypocritical to have any type
of quality control on food additives or food products more
generally. </p>

<p>A third and final concern is the legal liability of the
companies that would manufacture and sell the newly legalized
cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP. This is a very important
argument, and in order to fully understand its magnitude we must
mention what are known as &quot;Dram Shop&quot; laws. If not in
name, we are all familiar with what a Dram Shop law is - it is a
law that says that if bartenders continue to serve alcohol to
people that they know are already drunk, and that drunk person
later goes out and commits a crime such as drunk driving, then
the bartender or the bar can be held responsible. So the question
remains: would producers and sellers of legalized drugs be
responsible for the actions of the people who ingest them? If the
producers and sellers <i>would not </i>be liable, we have a
serious ethical problem inasmuch as they could destroy peoples'
lives with impunity in the name of profit and not be held morally
accountable. But if the producers and sellers would be liable --
that is, a Dram Shop type of law would apply to them --we would
probably have very few companies willing to market and sell
drugs. Put differently, if a given drug company knew that it
could be hit with a ten million dollar lawsuit when one of its
clients goes and kills someone (or damages property, etc.), is
that company likely to stay in business? Not likely. The company
likely would decide that the costs of doing business outweigh the
potential benefits and thus would close down shop. For proof of
this point ask yourself the following: How many companies are
there in the U.S. today that manufacture and sell asbestos
insulation? Answer: probably none. </p>

<p>In short, there are many legal and political issues that would
have to be dealt with if we legalized </p>

<p>drugs, and nowhere in the legalizers' literature have they
come up with adequate answers to these problems. </p>

say...</b> </p>

<p>We can legalize drugs without any legal difficulties. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, will drug use be able to be used as a
defense in criminal and civil trials? </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, would not we logically have to close
down the Food and Drug Administration and dispense with all laws
regulating the safety and quality of drugs, food additives and
food products? </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, would manufacturers and sellers be
liable for the actions of the people whom they sell drugs to? If
not, isn't there an ethical problem here? If so, can we
realistically expect anyone to enter the drug<b> </b>business? <br>
