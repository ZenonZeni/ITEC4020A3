<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>

<P>Net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1995 were $5,590,000 ($0.03 per share), an increase from $3,315,000 ($0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 1994. Contributing to the increase in earnings in 1995 was an accounting gain of $7.5 million, which was recorded by the Company in January 1995, resulting from the settlement of the Brisas property lawsuit in Venezuela. As part of the settlement, TVX received 1.5 million shares of Gold Reserve Corporation, a corporation listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the quarter, the Company reduced its outstanding silver position based on its assessment of the silver market, which partially offset the Brisas gain.      

<P>Gold equivalent production was 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 110,400 ounces (91,800 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1994.

<P>The realized price for gold in the first quarter of 1995 was $378 per ounce (1994 - $378) and for silver was $4.43 per ounce (1994 - $4.89).  Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 101,400 ounces was $375 per ounce in the period compared to $373 on 96,200 gold equivalent ounces sold in the same period of 1994.
 
<P>Cash costs on a gold equivalent basis in the first quarter of 1995 increased to $225 per ounce from $193 in the same period of 1994, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage. Higher operating costs at La Coipa, lower grades at Mineral Hill, and decreased mill throughput and lower grades at Casa Berardi were contributing factors to the overall increase in cash costs. The Brazilian operations results reflect an  increase in local costs due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.

<P>The Company anticipates that improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately $200 per ounce compared to $199 per ounce in 1994.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>OPERATIONS REVIEW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the first quarter of 1995 was 45,700 ounces ( 28,800 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) which compares to 48,000 ounces (29,400 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1994 period. Cash cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period increased to $188 from $163 the previous year. The increase in cash costs was primarily due to an increase in the consumption of zinc and cyanide during the quarter, which was required as a result of the changing nature of the ore. In addition, normal mill maintenance scheduled for later in 1995 was advanced to the first quarter.

<P>As well, La Coipa experienced a decline in milling throughput in the quarter, which has returned to target rates during the second quarter. The mine plan indicates cash costs of $170 per ounce for the year.    

<P><B>CRIXÁS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixás mine was 15,600 ounces in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 11,500 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is attributable to increased mill throughput. Cash costs for the period were $191 compared to $184 in the same period of 1994.  The increase is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  As a result of planned modifications to the mill, the Crixás mine is expected to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994. 

<P><B>BRASÍLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Brasília mine was 13,400 ounces in the first quarter compared to 9,300 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Brasília mine on January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%.  Cash costs for the period were $238 compared to $194 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at Brasília reflect the appreciation of the Brazilian currency  and the mining of lower grade ore. During the first quarter, the Brasília mine received, for an unprecedented sixth consecutive year, the five star award of excellence from the National Occupational Safety Association.

<P><B>NOVO ASTRO</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Novo Astro mine was 9,800 ounces in the first quarter compared to 12,400 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decline in production is the result of changing grades as the winding down of operations at Novo Astro commences. Plans are in place to facilitate an orderly shutdown, now scheduled for July, 1995. At $226 per ounce, cash costs were comparable to $225 per ounce recorded in the previous year.  
     
<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's 100% owned Mineral Hill mine produced 8,800 ounces of gold in the first quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. This decrease in production was a result of milling lower grade ore.  Cash costs for the period were $370 compared to $269 in the previous year. In order to offset future declines in production and decrease cash costs, plans are in place to accelerate the exploration and development program in the lower levels of the mine. In view of the face that new stoping areas are at least two months away, production and grade are expected to remain at approximately current levels for the second quarter. The development of the Crevice tunnel is progressing satisfactorily and at March 31, 1995, 3/4 of a kilometre of the total planned length of approximately 4 kilometres of the tunnel was complete. 

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 9,500 ounces in the first quarter compared to 16,300 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production  reflects the shutdown of operations at a high grade heading following a fatality in January, 1995. In addition, ongoing mine development was delayed.  Cash costs for the period were $277 compared to $213 in the previous year. Although first quarter results were disappointing, efforts continue to maintain production while the deep development program continues.  The deep development program remains on budget and on schedule, and shaft access and sinking continue according to plan.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's 50% owned New Britannia mine is scheduled to commence production in the third quarter of 1995. As the operator of the project, the Company has been successful in maintaining the construction and development of the project on budget and on schedule. The headframe has been erected and the foundation for the mill has been poured. It is expected that the mill will be in place by the end of the second quarter. Shaft sinking from the previous 600 metre level to the 1,000 metre level continues on schedule. Once operational, the mine is expected to produce 100,000 ounces of gold on annual basis.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>The Company remains confident that a positive production decision will be made in early 1996 at its 32% owned Musselwhite project. Drilling results at the project continue to exceed expectations and completion of the feasibility study is expected by year end.  Total proven and probable reserves are currently estimated to be 11 million tonnes averaging 9 grams of gold per tonne, at a cut-off grade of 4.5 grams per tonne, and containing 3.2 million (TVX share 1 million) ounces of gold.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>The Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project is anticipated to have one million ounces of reserves by the end of 1995. The Company increased its interest in the project to 100% during the first quarter of 1995.  An accelerated $3 million drilling program commenced in the first quarter. Initial results support the continued presence of sulfide systems with some veins being traced for over 200 metres in length. Drifting continues at a rate of 8 metres per day.   The 1995 program call for 500 metres of expansion on the existing 1,500 metres of development.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>The Company has an $8 million exploration program in place for 1995 at its 92% owned Pachicutza project in Ecuador. The exploration consists of 20,000 metres of drilling and about 3,000 metres of underground drifting.  The completion of an 18 kilometre road has facilitated  access to 60 kilometres of trails and allowed for the erection of seven temporary exploration camps, and a sample preparation facility. As of the end of the first quarter, 15 square kilometres of the concession were geologically mapped, 8 kilometres of trenching completed, and over 8,000 metres of core drilling sampled. Initial indicated resource calculations are anticipated by mid-1995.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NEW PROJECT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company was named the winning bidder for the Kassandra Mines in the latter part of the first quarter. The company proposes to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets for approximately $47 million. The purchase price will be payable as $19 million on closing with five equal installments, plus interest, on the anniversary dates of the closing. It is anticipated that the purchase will close in the second quarter of 1995. Company personnel continue to gear their efforts to allow for an orderly succession of operations. Plans are in place to commence  environmental rehabilitation, the employment and retraining of  miners, and the enhancement and modernization of the existing operations, upon the closing. The construction of an autoclave plant will be tendered to experienced engineering firms on a turn key basis. Upon completion of the autoclave plant and the subsequent start of commercial production, the anticipated annual production of the Kassandra Mines is estimated at 350,000 gold equivalent ounces for the initial three years of full production.  Thereafter gold equivalent production for the 20 year life of the project will be approximately 200,000 ounces per annum.   

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow from operations increased to $2.2 million in the first quarter of 1995, from $1.5 million in the comparable 1994 period, as a result of the increase in earnings described above.  Expenditures on mining properties, plant and equipment were $35.1 million in 1995 (1994 - $4.2 million) as the Company's development and expansion plans progress.  Major expenditures in 1995 include the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in the Brasília mine for $14 million, construction of the New Britannia mine for $3.1 million and development and expansion of the Mineral Hill mine ($2.1 million) and the Casa Berardi mine ($2.8 million).  The Company's net cash position remained strong at $81 million at the end of the first quarter (1994 - $144 million).<BR>
