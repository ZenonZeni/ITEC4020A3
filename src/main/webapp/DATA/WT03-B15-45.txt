<I>"I attempted to meet with management... At the entrance I was confronted by six or seven security personnel who blocked my way. Within seconds three military people with rifles came running from the direction of the office building."</I> Kees Marges, special representative of the International Transport Workers' Federation visiting sacked transport workers in Turkey in July 1995.

<P>Halil Dinç is the president of the Turkish transport workers’ union, TÜMTIS, in Izmir. On 22 December 1995 he joined a peaceful protest by about 100 members outside the headquarters of Nak-Kargo, a transport company. The TÜMTIS members had gathered in solidarity with 43 workers at Nak-Kargo sacked for refusing to give up their union membership.
<P>The TÜMTIS representatives asked for a meeting with the management of the company. The response was an attack by riot police which left Halil Dinç with a head wound requiring seven stitches and injuries which kept him off work for seven days. <I>"…anti-riot police and police from the local Çamdibi police station… started to beat us without any warning although we had gathered peacefully. The anti-riot police beat us with truncheons. The chief of Çamdibi police station beat me over the head with his walkie-talkie… While my head was bleeding the anti-riot police went on beating me with truncheons, especially on the head. They also punched and kicked me…"</I>
<P><I>"…Only a few days after I received the head injury and was still wearing a bandage around my head, police beat me again on the head with their fists."</I>
<P>When Halil Dinç and seven other trade unionists went to the police station to complain about the beatings, they were detained for 24 hours.   TÜMTIS members continued to picket the Nak-Kargo offices every day - one of the many protests organised by Turkish workers in defence of their right to union organisation.

<P>Hundreds of thousands of Turkish have joined in protests since April 1994 when the government of Prime Minister Tansu Çiller introduced an economic "austerity package". A wave of anger spread across the country as inflation rose to 150 per cent and over 650,000 workers lost their jobs.
<P>Outside the militarised areas of the southeast, the state tolerates political debate in controlled environments such as newspapers and television. Politics on the street is another matter. Turkish citizens who air their grievances in public risk arrest and beatings.
<P>Turkish trade unionists have suffered brutal repression. They have been harassed, detained and beaten. Demonstrations have been violently dispersed by the police and union members have been prosecuted under the Anti-Terror Law for speeches made during union meetings. Employers have increasingly used private security guards, as well as the security forces, to intimidate workers. Turkish law imposes many restrictions on trade union rights. Most of the restrictions date from the period of military rule. In 1991 the government committed itself to bringing legislation into line with international standards, but little has been done to put this commitment into practice. The state continues to attack the right to organise, to freedom of association and freedom of expression.
