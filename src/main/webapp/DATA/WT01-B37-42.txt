</b></pre>

<p>Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak before
the Subcommittee today on these important issues.<br>
The drug problem in our society is clearly one which is very
serious and which concerns all Americans. Although substance
abuse cuts across all class and racial lines, the impact of the
drug problem has probably been greatest among lowincome and
minority communities. In my testimony today, I would like to
focus in particular on the impact of the war on drugs as it
affects Black and Hispanic communities.<br>
<b>YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM<br>
</b>In February of this year, my organization released a report
on race and the criminal justice system. The report, &quot;Young
Black Men and the Criminal Justice System: A Growing National
Problem,&quot; received extensive attention and shocked much of
the nation. The report documented that almost one out of four
Black men in the age group 2029 is under the control of the
criminal justice system prison, jail, probation or parole. This
contrasts with one in sixteen white males and one in ten Hispanic
males.<br>
These figures for Black males, shocking as they are, actually
understate the extent of the problem since our study only did a
oneday count of the criminal justice system. If we were able to
calculate the rates for an entire year, or tenyear period, the
number of Black males under criminal justice control would be
considerably higher than one in four.<br>
There is also strong reason to believe that the figures for
Hispanics represent an undercount. There has been a great deal of
inconsistency in the way in which Hispanics are counted in
criminal justice populations, and for many categories, there
exist a large number of offenders for whom no data exist on
ethnicity. Because of this, it is reasonable to conclude that the
rate of criminal justice control for young Hispanic males is
higher than one in ten. Also, since Hispanics are counted in the
white criminal justice populations, the rate of criminal justice
control for non-Hispanic whites is therefore less than the one in
sixteen which we were able to document.<br>
Our report further found that the number of young Black men in
the criminal justice system 609,690 far exceeded the number of
Black men of all ages enrolled in higher education 436,000. These
two figures taken together paint a very disturbing picture.<br>
As we noted in our report:<br>
For the Black community in general, nearly onefourth of its young
men are under the control of the criminal justice system at a
time when their peers are beginning families, learning
constructive life skills, and starting careers....Unless the
criminal justice system can be used to assist more young Black
males in pursuing these objectives, any potential positive
contributions they can make to the community will be delayed, or
lost forever.<br>
Our report estimated that the direct costs to the criminal
justice system for the control of the 609,000 Black men in their
twenties was $2.5 billion. Each offender who is incarcerated in a
state prison costs the taxpayers at least $16,000 a year.
Corrections costs have now reached the point where they are
having a serious impact on state funding for necessary social
services. In Michigan, for example, state spending for
corrections increased from 2.8 percent of the budget in 1984 to
7.2 percent in 1988. The National Conference of State Legislators
reports that state spending on corrections increased by an
average of 14.2 percent last year, contributing to &quot;serious
budget problems&quot; that more than half the states will face in
1990.<br>
<b>WHY ARE SO MANY YOUNG BLACK MALES UNDER THE CONTROL <br>
OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM?<br>
</b>It is important to analyze the factors which have led us to
this distressing situation. The reasons behind this are complex.
Many are longstanding problems; others are a result of more
recent criminal justice policies. I would like to outline some of
the primary causes of this problem, and then to discuss the
impact which the war on drugs has had.<br>
1. <u>&quot;Get Tough&quot; Sentencing Policies<br>
</u>The U.S. Sentencing Commission and legislatures in almost all
fifty states have adopted a variety of increasingly harsh
sentencing laws in the past decade. In addition, parole release
policies have become more restrictive in many states. The
combined impact of these policies is that our prison and jail
populations have doubled in the past decade, to the point where
there are now more than one million Americans behind bars.
Prisons in 41 states are under court order regarding overcrowding
and conditions of confinement. Record numbers of offenders are
now also straining our probation and parole systems. <br>
Mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws have played a significant
role in leading to these higher rates of criminal justice
control, particularly in regard to prison populations. Two recent
highly publicized cases illustrate this:<br>
The <u>American Lawyer</u> reported on the case of Susana Sanchez
Robles, a migrant worker and mother of five whose husband had
left her, leaving the family on welfare. Ms. Sanchez Robles drove
a drug laden van across the border from Mexico, and received a
mandatory ten year prison term. Her five year old cries every
evening. Says Ms. Sanchez Robles: &quot;I try to feel strong, but
my strength is just totally defeated when I remember my children.
<br>
Richard Winrow is a 22year old Los Angeles man who was abandoned
by his father as a boy. He and his seven siblings grew up poor,
and Winrow ended up dropping out of high school and working at
low wage jobs. A recent conviction for possession of 5 1/2 ounces
of cocaine, a relatively small amount, was his third drug
offense. Under new federal drug laws, Winrow was sentenced to
life without the possibility of parole.<br>
The dramatic increases in incarceration, parole and probation
rates resulting from our &quot;get tough&quot; policies have
affected all segments of society. The increase, however, has been
most significant for Blacks and other minorities, who were
already disproportionately represented in the system.<br>
The rise in criminal justice populations has occurred without any
clearcut relationship to the crime rate. FBI reports for the past
decade indicate that crime rates have had periods of both decline
and increase during these years, but that overall there was only
a 2 percent increase in crime rates between 197988. Crime rates
rose again in 1989, even though the nation recorded the highest
increase ever in its prison population.<br>
2. <u>Criminal Justice Focus on Crimes of the Poor<br>
</u>The criminal justice system has historically been focused
much more on &quot;crime in the streets&quot; than &quot;crime in
the suites.&quot; Although we have seen some change in recent
years in the prosecution of white collar offenses, crimes of the
poor have always received greater attention from the criminal
justice system. Since Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately
represented among lowincome people, this has contributed to their
over-representation in the criminal justice system. This does not
imply that crimes of the poor are necessarily either more or less
serious than crimes of the wealthy, but rather, that we have a
system that functions at least in part in a very discretionary
manner.<br>
3. <u>Race and the Criminal Justice System<br>
</u>There has been a good deal of debate about the extent to
which race influences criminal justice decisionmaking. A recent
study by the RAND Corporation concludes that race was not a
factor in sentencing decisions in California. It is important to
note, though, that California has a relatively rigid determinate
sentencing system, which allows for less variability in
sentencing outcomes than in many other states.<br>
Our report found evidence that the criminal justice system may be
treating Black offenders differently than white offenders. The
number of young white males who are incarcerated, 247,000,
slightly exceeds the number of incarcerated Black males, 212,000.
The number of white males receiving probation, though, 697,000,
vastly exceeds the figure for Black males, 305,000. While the
nature of the offense or prior criminal history may explain these
figures, a close examination of this disparity should be
undertaken to determine to what extent racial bias is a factor. <br>
As the authors of the RAND study point out, as well as many
others, race may play a more prominent role at the level of
arrest and prosecution, where greater discretion may be exercised
by police and prosecutors. This discretion may not always be
racially motivated, but it may have a racial impact. To the
extent that this is the case, a task for the courts is to attempt
to offset any disparity that may have occurred through
appropriate sentencing.<br>
4. <u>Declining Social and Economic Support in Black Communities <br>
</u>The relationship between social and economic conditions and
individual crime rates is a complex one. Not all poor people or
unemployed people commit crimes, nor do all wealthy or employed
persons refrain from committing crimes. Personality traits,
family support, community constraints, and other factors all
influence individual behavior and the propensity to commit crime.<br>
Yet, as criminologist Elliott Currie has noted, &quot;The
evidence for a strong association between inequality and crime is
overwhelming ... It isn't accidental, then, that among developed
countries, the United States is afflicted simultaneously with the
worst rates of violent crime, the widest spread of income
inequality, and the most severe public policies toward the
disadvantaged.&quot; <br>
The stresses, strains, and lack of opportunity present in so many
minority communities increase the likelihood that individuals
within that community will engage in criminal activities, whether
as a means of obtaining money, to support a drug habit, for a
challenge, or for other reasons.<br>
Given these factors, we need to look at the deteriorating social
and economic support in the Black community. Essentially, we find
that on a broad range of variables, the situation of Blacks in
our society has declined over the past decade. The Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities reports that total appropriations
for low income programs that are not entitlements fell by 54
percent from FY 81 to FY 88, when adjusted for inflation. This
included support for job training, health and social services,
and housing programs. Also, although the number of Americans
living below the poverty line increased by 3.2 million during
this period, spending for food stamps decreased by 15 percent
when adjusted for inflation. Black households make up 36 percent
of all households receiving food stamps. Overall, these cuts
affect Blacks and other minorities disproportionately, since they
are disproportionately poor. <br>
5. <u>Lack of Opportunity and Sense of Hopelessness<br>
</u>An additional factor contributing to this situation is the
most difficult to quantify, yet in some ways the most
significant. In many communities today, young people growing up
have little hope for the future. It is one thing for a college
student to work at a fast food restaurant as a summer job. It is
entirely different for a young person to take on this kind of job
when there is little expectation of rising above this entry
level. <br>
The numbers in our report were not as shocking to most people in
the Black community. Instead, they confirmed what many have
recognized for years: for Black males, the criminal justice
system has become almost an inevitable aspect of growing up. This
is not to say that it is a &quot;rite of passage,&quot; or an
event that is welcomed, but merely, that it is viewed as a part
of the life cycle which is almost unavoidable. This is a very sad
commentary on our society.<br>
<b>THE &quot;WAR ON DRUGS&quot; AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM<br>
</b>A final factor contributing to increased involvement in the
criminal justice system, particularly among Black Americans, is
the war on drugs, and the means by which this war is being waged.
This has been the result of two factors.<br>
First, the drug problem has been defined basically as a law
enforcement problem, and not a social problem. In terms of our
political rhetoric, our funding priorities, and our policy
discussions, we have primarily chosen an approach which
emphasizes police and prisons over prevention and treatment. This
is not a new approach, or one which Mr. Bennett's office has
initiated unilaterally. Most states and localities have taken
this approach for many years, with unfortunately, little impact
on either drug use, availability, or drug related crime.<br>
Second, although drug use and abuse occurs among all groups in
society, drug law enforcement is disproportionately weighted
toward inner city, low income drug use, again primarily affecting
Blacks and Hispanics. A few statistics illustrate this problem.
FBI data indicate that Blacks make up an increasing percentage of
drug arrests, having increased from 30 to 38 percent of the total
between 1984 and 1988. According to the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, Blacks make up only 12 percent of those who use
illegal drugs. <br>
In Florida, Blacks now make up 73.3 percent of all prison
admissions for drug offenses, compared to 53.6 percent for all
other offenses. <br>
If the war on drugs continues in its present fashion, our prisons
will become increasingly filled with Black youth. The plight of
young Black men and the Black community which we described in our
report will only worsen.<br>
<b>POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
</b>I do not believe that the large number of Black males within
the criminal justice system necessarily represents an intended
consequence of our crime control policies. Unfortunately,
however, as an <u>unintended</u> consequence of scores of
individual sentencing laws, use of discretion in the criminal
justice system, and funding priorities, we have created a true
crisis for the Black community, for the criminal justice system,
and for a nation that hopes to provide freedom and opportunity
for all citizens. A continuation of the war on drugs in the
manner in which it has been fought, no matter how well intended,
will only exacerbate this situation. <br>
If we wish to address this problem in a serious manner,
policymakers and criminal justice leaders need to respond in a
comprehensive manner. Elements of such a strategy include:<br>
1. <u>Increase Diversion from the Criminal Justice System</u> <br>
Many young and minor offenders are only stigmatized by their
contact with the criminal justice system, without necessarily
receiving either appropriate supervision or support.
Opportunities exist to divert many of these offenders to
organizations and individuals who can better focus on the
problems of Black, Hispanic, and poor youth.<br>
As a result of our report, for example, Black community leaders
in Memphis have formed a chapter of the 100 Black Men
Incorporated. The group's goal is to reduce the number of Black
men going into the criminal justice system. Its activities will
include establishing mentor programs, developing mechanisms for
keeping Black youth in school, and working with young offenders
in the juvenile justice system.<br>
Policymakers can encourage development of programs such as these,
and court officials can divert more defendants into them, thereby
beginning to reduce the extent of criminal justice control in
many communities.<br>
2. <u>Sentencing to Ameliorate Racial Disparities</u> <br>
Judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and probation officers
all have a unique and important opportunity to lessen the drastic
impact which the justice system has had on Blacks and Hispanics.
That opportunity comes at the time of sentencing. The courtroom
sentencing process should include a full examination of the
circumstances of both victim and offender, and an analysis of
community support and supervision mechanisms which may be able to
contribute to appropriate sentencing options. The goals of this
process should be several: to assess public safety concerns; to
restore victims to the extent possible; to order appropriate and
constructive sanctions in the community; and, to reduce the
chances that offenders will return to the system. As an
organization familiar with sentencing programs and sentencing
reform efforts throughout the country, our staff knows that these
are attainable goals.<br>
Court officials should also establish mechanisms to monitor
whether minority offenders are appropriately represented in
non-incarcerative sentencing alternatives, such as community
corrections programs, house arrest, and electronic monitoring. If
disparities exist, an analysis of the reasons for this should be
undertaken. In the juvenile justice area, The National Council of
Juvenile and Family Court Judges is currently developing policy
recommendations to respond to the disproportionate incarceration
of minority youth. These may serve as a model which could be
adopted for the criminal justice system.<br>
3. <u>Restore Appropriate Judicial Discretion</u> <br>
White collar offenders such as Ivan Boesky and Oliver North
receive a full consideration of appropriate sentencing options.
For many of the indigent defendants filling up our nation's
prisons, mandatory and guideline sentencing virtually prohibit
any consideration of alternative sentencing options. Abuse of
judicial discretion needs to be carefully monitored, but use of
judicial discretion to respond to individual and community needs
at sentencing should be encouraged.<br>
4. <u>Encourage Courts to Make Greater Use of Alternatives to
Incarceration<br>
</u>Incarceration is by far the most costly component of the
criminal justice system. It has also not proved to be very
productive as a means of reducing crime. A variety of community
based sanctions exist which have been demonstrated to be
appropriate punishments for a wide range of offenders. These
include restitution to victims, community service work, intensive
probation supervision, and provisions for treatment programs,
education, and employment. <br>
My organization, The Sentencing Project, has helped develop many
programs that offer courts alternatives to prison in a range of
cases, and we have seen courts accept these alternatives in well
over half the cases presented. We know that judges can and will
make more use of alternatives, if given the opportunity to do so
at sentencing.<br>
5. <u>Reduce Lengthy and Inefficient Prison Terms<br>
</u>Mandatory sentencing laws and lengthier prison terms have
resulted in high costs, with only relatively modest gains in
crime control. Prisoners are prevented from committing crimes in
the community while they are locked up, but this represents only
a small fraction of all crimes. A 1978 report by the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that to achieve a 10 percent
reduction in crime, New York would have had to increase its
prison population by 263 percent and Massachusetts by 310
percent. <br>
The massive increase in incarceration and lengthening of prison
terms provides almost no long term benefits in reduction of
recidivism. The most recent Justice Department study of this
issue shows that recidivism rates, while very high, are virtually
identical for prisoners who serve anywhere from one to five
years. Therefore, &quot;getting tough&quot; results in high
corrections costs, but leaves us with offenders who are no less
likely to commit future crimes.<br>
Reducing lengthy prison terms by itself is not the answer to
crime. What it would accomplish though, is to relieve the burden
on an overcrowded system, to reduce the impact of the system on
minorities, and to free up tax dollars to be used for prevention,
a more effective means of crime control.<br>
6. <u>Require Racial/Ethnic Impact Statements from the Office of
National Drug Control Policy<br>
</u>Given the serious impact of drugs and the drug war on
minority communities, I would suggest that the Office of National
Drug Control Policy be required to submit an annual report on the
impact of its policies and funding priorities on racial and
ethnic communities. Such a report might include the degree to
which funding is made available to minority communities and
organizations, the impact of prosecution and incarceration on
these communities, and the number of persons receiving drug
treatment services. This type of analysis would help to provide a
focus for policy considerations regarding minority communities.<br>
7. <u>Develop More Accurate Reporting Methods for Hispanics <br>
</u>As noted above, there is reason to believe that Hispanics are
undercounted in the criminal justice system due to
inconsistencies in reporting methods and lack of data. It is
important to develop policies and procedures that are consistent
nationwide in order to assess the impact of criminal justice
policies on Hispanic communities, and to enable the criminal
justice system to respond more appropriately to its varied
populations.<br>
8. <u>Restore a Balanced Perspective on the Relative Role of
Criminal Justice Sanctions and Social and Economic Supports <br>
</u>The criminal justice system does not necessarily provide the
best forum for reducing crime. As the American Bar Association
Criminal Justice Section's Special Committee on Criminal Justice
in a Free Society reported, of approximately 34 million serious
crimes committed against persons or property in 1988, 31 million
never resulted in arrest and only several hundred thousand
resulted in felony convictions and imprisonment. Simply put, law
enforcement and court officials could, under the best of
conditions, effectively prosecute and punish only a small portion
of overall criminal activity.<br>
Our continued excessive emphasis on a law enforcement strategy to
fight drugs fails to address the root causes of the drug problem.
Our emphasis on punitive criminal justice remedies distracts us
from more fundamental and potentially far-reaching questions: why
is it that citizens of one of the wealthiest nations and of all
social classes use illegal substances to the extent that
Americans do today?<br>
For inner city and low income communities, these root causes are
certainly more closely tied to poverty, lack of opportunity, poor
education and health care, and lack of hope for the future, than
to any lack of jail and prison cells.<br>
At the same time we have been waging a law enforcement war, with
its own negative effects upon young Black males, conditions for
Black communities have worsened on other fronts as well. A new
study by the National Center for Children in Poverty of Columbia
University documents that half of Black children and 40 percent
of Hispanic children under the age of six now live in poverty. It
should be clear to those of us within the criminal justice system
as well as others, that unless we effectively address issues of
poverty immediately, we are likely to see the next generation of
Black males enter the criminal justice system at a rate even
higher than one in four. <br>
We have a choice. We can spend money on prisons, and on policies
that are guaranteed to fill them with people who don't need to be
in them, including many young Black men, <u>or</u> we can spend
more time, energy, creativity and money to keep more people out
of the system entirely. Funding for poverty-fighting,
crime-preventing programs should be viewed from the long-term
perspective, as a preventive measure which will reduce criminal
justice costs in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>CONCLUSION<br>
</b>Of the scores of editorials which appeared in response to our
report (see Appendix) almost all uniformly endorsed the range of
policy recommendations I have suggested here. This reaction shows
that the public may be much more ready for change than many
policymakers have led us to believe.<br>
The funding and policy decisions we make today regarding our
approach to the drug problem will have a direct impact on the
next generation of Black men. As an editorial in the <u>Charleston
(S.C.) Post/Courier</u> noted, &quot;If the festering cycle of
poverty, violence and hate is not broken, more black men will be
doomed to lives of crime and years behind bars.&quot; </p>
