<b>SUMMARY</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
This report presents a detailed analysis of the international trade in
surveillance technology.  Its' primary concern is the flow of sophisticated
computer-based technology from developed countries to developing countries  -
and particularly to non-democratic regimes. It is in this environment where
surveillance technologies become technologies of political control. <p>
<p>
Surveillance technologies can be defined as technologies which can monitor,
track and assess the movements, activities and communications of individuals.
These include an array of visual recording devices, bugging equipment, computer
information systems and identification systems. These innovations are used by
military, police and intelligence authorities as technologies of repression.<p>
<p>
The surveillance trade is almost indistinguishable from the arms trade. More
than seventy per cent of companies manufacturing and exporting surveillance
technology also export arms, chemical weapons, or military hardware.
Surveillance is a crucial element for the maintenance of any  non-democratic
infrastructure, and is an important activity in the pursuit of intelligence and
political control. Many countries in transition to democracy also rely heavily
on surveillance to satisfy the demands of police and military. The technology
described in this report makes possible mass surveillance of populations.  In
the past, regimes relied on targeted surveillance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>Big Brother Incorporated</u> is the first investigation ever conducted into
this trade.  Privacy International intends to update the report from time to
time as more information becomes available. <p>
<p>
The report identifies the trade with such countries as Nigeria, China, Angola,
Rwanda Zambia and Indonesia. More than 80 British companies are involved,
making the UK the world leader in this field. Other countries, in order of
significance, are the United States, France, Israel, the Netherlands and
Germany.<p>
<p>
It is derived from company information, trade fair data, annual reports and
media reports.  It lists the companies, their directors, products and exports.
In each case, source material is meticulously cited. Addresses and contact
numbers are as current as possible but in some cases these will be out of
date.<p>

<b></b><p>
<b>OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
Numerous investigations and reports in the past decade have highlighted the
extent to which the global arms trade nurtures and supports brutal and
repressive regimes across the world. The industry and its participants have
been put under the microscope by a number of parliamentary inquiries in Europe
and North America. Without exception, these have uncovered a complex and
profitable trade with few controls and with no ethical compass.<p>
<p>
<u>Big Brother Incorporated</u> is concerned with a parallel activity involving
many companies involved in the arms trade. The international trade in
surveillance technology (sometimes known as the Repression Trade) involves the
manufacture and export of technologies of political control. These technologies
involve sophisticated computer-based technology which vastly increases the
power of authorities.<p>
<p>
Amongst the products involved are : <p>
<p>
*   telephone interception equipment <p>
*   bugging devices <p>
*   police and military information systems <p>
*   ID cards <p>
*   "System X" telephone systems<p>
*   communications logging systems <p>
*   micro-cameras <p>
*   parabolic microphones <p>
*   automatic transcription systems <p>
*   infra red scopes <p>
*   night vision equipment <p>
*   advanced CCTV equipment <p>
*   geographic information systems <p>
*   vehicle tracking technology  <p>
*   automated fingerprint systems <p>
*   biometric technology  <p>
*   cellular intercept systems <p>
*   computer intercept systems <p>
*   crowd analysis and monitoring technology <p>
*   data matching programs<p>
<p>
<p>
Much of this technology is used to track the activities of dissidents, human
rights activists, journalists, student leaders, minorities, trade union
leaders, and political opponents. It is also useful for monitoring larger
sectors of the population. With this technology, the financial transactions,
communications activity and geographic movements of millions of people can be
captured, analyzed and transmitted cheaply and efficiently. The emerging
information and communications infrastructures of countries can be hijacked for
limitless surveillance purposes.<p>
<p>
In the absence of meaningful legal or constitutional protections, such
technology is inimical to democratic reform.  It can certainly prove fatal to
anyone "of interest" to a regime.<p>
<p>
Western surveillance technology is providing invaluable support to military and
totalitarian authorities throughout the world.  British computer firm ICL
(International Computers Limited) provided the technological infrastructure to
establish the South African automated Passbook system, upon which much of the
functioning of the Apartheid regime depended.  In the late 1970s Security
Systems International supplied security technology to Idi Amin's brutal regime
in Uganda.<p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Israeli company Tadiram developed and exported the technology for
the computerized death list used by the Guatemalan police. Meanwhile, companies
such as PK Electronics routinely provide the Chinese authorities with bugging
equipment and telephone tapping devices.<p>
<p>
The extent of Western support for inhumane regimes is widespread. The notorious
human rights abuses in Indonesia - particularly those affecting East Timor -
would not be possible without the strategic and technological support of
Western companies.  Amongst those companies supplying the Indonesian police and
military with surveillance and targeting technology are Morpho Systems
(France), De la Rue Printak (UK), EEV Night Vision (UK), ICL (UK), Marconi
Radar and Control Systems (UK), Pyser (UK), Siemens Plessey Defense Systems
(UK) Rockwell International Corporation (USA) and SWS Security (USA). These and
other corporations supply the intelligence gathering and identification systems
necessary to pursue a program of ethnic cleansing.<p>
<p>
This technology is exported to virtually all countries with appalling human
rights records. Nigeria is supplied by such companies as Codalex (Canada) and
Continental Microwave (UK).  Companies supplying to Chinese authorities are
numerous, but include Phillips (Netherlands) EEV Night Vision (UK), GEC Marconi
(UK), GPT-Plessey Telecom (UK), Pilkington PE Ltd (UK) and Siemens Plessey
(UK).<p>
<p>
The Thailand Central Population Database and ID card system, developed by the
US based Control Data Systems, involves sophisticated intelligence that has
been used for political purposes by the Thai military. This integrated system
creates an ID card, electronic fingerprint and facial image, and electronic
data link involving the entire population. It spans most government agencies
and is controlled by the powerful military/police dominated Interior Ministry.
<p>
<p>
Databases in the Thai system include : Central Population Database, National
Election System, Political Party Database, Political Member Database, Voter
listing, Electronic Minority Group Registration System, Electronic Fingerprint
Identification System, Electronic Face Identification System, Population and
House Report System, National Tax Collection System, Village Information
System, Secret Information System, Public Opinion System, Criminal
Investigation System, National Security System, Social Security System,
Passport Control System, Driver Control System, Gun Registration, Family
Registration, Alien Control System and Immigration Control System. <p>
<p>
Similar ID card and "smart" card systems have been marketed to more than two
dozen developing countries.  Without exception, they result in wholesale
discrimination and hardship for vulnerable people. Such systems can adversely
affect the delicate balance pursued by an emerging democracy. The adoption of
Information Technology (IT) involves a change to the relationship between
citizen and the State. The use of surveillance technologies vastly increases
this change.<p>
<p>
The justification advanced by the companies involved in this trade is identical
to the justification advanced in the arms trade -   i.e. that the technology is
neutral. Privacy International's view is that in the absence of legal
protections, the technology can never be neutral.  Even those technologies
intended for "benign" uses rapidly develop more sinister purposes.  The UK
manufactured "Scoot"  traffic control cameras in Beijing's Tianamen Square were
automatically employed as surveillance cameras during the student
demonstrations. Images captured from the cameras was broadcast over Chinese
television to ensure that the offending students were captured.  <p>
<p>
The emerging Information Superhighway also poses fundamental threats to
developing countries (the Superhighway is a metaphor for the convergence of
information and communications systems to form a national and international
information web. The 1995 summit of the G7 (the seven richest industrial
powers) linked arms with some of the most dominant corporations in the
technology industry to form a consensus about how the Superhighway should be
built.  They agreed to a set of principles that would maximize growth,
development  and profit.  Relatively little attention was paid to the negative
impact of the Superhighway on developing countries and on the rights and
privacy of citizens of all countries. <p>
<p>
Martin Bangermann,  Europe's Commissioner in charge of information technology,
has remarked "We will not achieve the Information Society unless we give the
free market a free rein". In the context of the trade in surveillance
technologies to third world countries, this signals a "hands off" policy. An
unregulated Superhighway is likely to maximize surveillance and increase the
power of institutions in control of the technology.<p>
<p>
It should be a source of grave concern that the world's telecommunications and
computer companies have been moving to force government to back away from
regulating information technology. In 1994, under the leadership of US Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a consortium of the world's
leading companies have formed the Global Information Infrastructure Commission
(GIIC). Headed by the president of Mitsubishi, the chairman of EDS, and the
vice chairman of Siemens Corporation, the GIIC intends to create a conglomerate
of interests powerful enough to subsume government interest in regulation. <p>
 <p>
The effort is being funded to a large extent by the World Bank, which in early
1994 appears to have been persuaded by CSIS that unregulated economic
investment was more important to developing economies than social and political
reform. The corporate sector, argued CSIS, can deliver this economic reform
along the Superhighway. And they can do it best if they, not the governments,
take the lead. <p>
<p>
The unregulated development and export of these technologies creates grave and
unnecessary threats to developing countries. The trade requires scrutiny and
regulation to help minimize the fatal impact that it can cause. Whether this
impact is intended or unforseen, the surveillance industry has a responsibility
to ensure that the export and development of its products conform to scrupulous
ethical standards. Developed countries should ensure that the export industry
is regulated. Technological assessment must be a pre-requisite.<p>
<p>
This report is by no means comprehensive. It omits numerous government-led
systems. For example, the notorious PROMIS surveillance software marketed
throughout the world by the US Justice Department has led to widespread fears
about the creation of an international tracking system for individuals "of
interest". The US, French and British governments' moves to limit effective
encryption systems is also of profound importance to developing countries, but
is not dealt with in any detail here.  These and many other issues will be
explored in updates of<u> Big Brother Incorporated</u>  We are hoping that
interested people will contact us to provide further information on this trade.
We also welcome "clarification" of the facts by the companies named in this
report.<p>
