<BR>
<I>Thank you for joining CPJ in this appeal. Please mail a copy of this letter, or write your own based on this example, to the Nigerian leader Gen. Sani Abacha. Or, send a copy of the letter by e-mail to Kakuna Kerina, CPJ&#146;s Africa program coordinator, who will send it for you.</I><br>
<hr>
<BR>
His Excellency Gen. Sani Abacha<BR>
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces<BR>
State House<BR>
Abuja, NIGERIA<P>

Your Excellency:<P>

I support the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan press freedom advocacy group, in its campaign to obtain the release from prison of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-based <I>Tell </I>magazine and a recipient of CPJ&#146;s 1993 International Press Freedom Awards. Igiebor was arrested on Dec. 23, 1995, by agents of the State Security Service. He continues to be held in solitary confinement without charge and has been denied legal counsel and family visitation rights.<P>

Igiebor&#146;s imprisonment is a clear violation of Article 19 of the United Nations&#146; Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, &#147Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.&#148; Nigeria is a signatory to this declaration.<P>

Also in violation of Article 19 is the imprisonment of journalists Kunle Ajibade (<I>TheNEWS</I>), Christine Anyanwu (<I>The Sunday Magazine</I>), George Mbah (<I>Tell</I>) and Ben Charles Obi (<I>Weekend Classique</I>). They continue to be held in deplorable and life-threatening conditions, and have been denied the internationally recognized human right to medical care, legal representation and family visitation. <P>

I respectfully call on Your Excellency to order the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Igiebor and his colleagues and to allow them to resume their journalistic work. Until the time of their release, I also request that you grant them their rights to medical care, legal representation and family visitation.<P>

Lastly, I respectfully call on you to intervene on the side of press freedom and to uphold your public proclamations of support for an independent press by establishing an environment in which journalists may work freely and safely.<P>

I welcome your comments and reply.<P>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<BR><BR><BR>
