<P>
<P>The following overview provides a first description of our work carried out in the area of sensors and sensor integration. For further information please reply to us the form at the end of this document or contact us <A HREF="/ecm/ecm/lage_e.htm">directly</A>. 
<HR>
<P>The standard manufacturing robot is not capable of detecting on-line changes in the geometry of workpieces or to get information about unforeseen states of workpiece handling or system failure without the use of sensor technology. Especially in flexible workcells designed for small batch production it is necessary that the cell controller is able to react on all possible states of the manufacturing system, i.e. changes of the workpiece position, spatial differences of workpieces and common conditions of the manufacturing environment.
<P>Within several research projects sensors for that purpose have been realised and evaluated in industry environments. The aim was to ensure low tolerances of the manufactured workpiece, while considering the simultaneous integration of mostly different manufacturing technologies like arc welding and spot welding in parallel. This required a high degree of flexibility with regard to the performance of the sensor systems and the sensing tasks to be achieved.
<P>Especially for process control, the time required for signal sampling and evaluation has a significant influence on the quality of the manufacturing process. Short reaction cycles are a must for for sensor integration. Subsequently, the development of fast and powerful real time signal sampling/processing hardware and software can be considered to be one of ECM mayor objectives in the area of sensorics.
