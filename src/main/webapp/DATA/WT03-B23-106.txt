<B>ISSUES</B>
<P>
1. The Federation is of the view that current LACV funding of
duty lawyer services should not be extended to the Family Court
jurisdiction until a <B>needs analysis </B>is done, to see if
there is a real need for such a service to exist. On the basis
of the information provided, it will then be possible to determine
the type of service that is necessary. We note that the nature
of cases in this jurisdiction can be quite emotive and legally
complex. Often issues of Property Law and Taxation can apply.
We understand however, that the current unremunerated scheme operating
in Dandenong has been a success.<BR>

<P>
The Federation is of the view that a duty lawyer scheme is required
in relation to intervention orders, however, we are of the view
that a holistic approach to this sensitive area needs to be adopted
with special training for the lawyers concerned which could be
co-ordinated and resourced through the Women's Legal Resource
Group (given their expertise in this area). This will be discussed
in more detail later by the Group.<BR>

<P>
The Federation does believe there may be a need for the extension
of the duty-lawyer scheme into the Family Court jurisdiction of
the Magistrates' Court. It is the experience of our members that
often unrepresented parties find themselves railroaded by practitioners
on the other side into making concessions. As a great number of
determinations of the court are done by consent, there is very
little scope to protect the unrepresented person's interests.
The Federation would not recommend a duty -lawyer scheme in this
context if the case were of a complex nature. Representation in
complex Family Law matters requires extensive preparation that
cannot be handled within the limitations of a duty- lawyer scheme.
<BR>

<P>
2. The Federation is sceptical about any introduction of a common
structure for all duty lawyer schemes funded by the LACV. It believes
that investigation into the different variables such as the region,
different court practices, the degree of specialisation necessary,
other services available within the area, work loads, the type
of law and the needs arising out of that type would all be factors
which have a bearing on the structure of such a scheme . It would
therefore depend on the model being adopted and why it was adopted.
Clearly this question is difficult to answer until further investigation
has occurred.<BR>

<P>
3. The Federation is of the view that <B>current accreditation
is inadequate. </B>We believe that a general advocacy course at
Leo Cussen is not sufficiently geared to the nature of duty- lawyer
work. We would submit that a person who has been a duty-lawyer
and who is aware of ongoing developments should be the trainer.
Duty-Lawyering is not like general court advocacy. It involves
a race against time, dealing with a number of clients one after
another, an ability to quickly familiarise oneself with the law
and facts of the case and the ability to think quickly on one's
feet. It is stressful and only someone who has been exposed to
the type of practice involved will have developed survival strategies
that would be of real assistance. Those currently practising as
duty lawyers would need to be re-accredited but we are suggesting
that such accreditation would need to be renewed periodically
in any event.
<P>
The Federation is also concerned about the situation with respect
to duty-lawyers in rural areas. Despite the existence of training
for lawyers in rural areas it would appear this is done on an
ad hoc basis, depending on how disciplined the co-ordinators of
the private practitioner programmes are in those rural areas.
It is suggested that the requirement of accreditation and training
be applied more rigourously to assist the often young practitioners
in those areas.<BR>

<P>
4.We have a number of concerns about the current structuring of
the delivery of legal aid services by private practitioners. The
Federation<B> does not believe that the tendering of the service
to private practitioners should be based solely on who can provide
the cheapest service.</B> There are more issues to consider than
saving money when endeavouring to improve access to justice. The
quality of the service of the practitioner must be a substantial
criteria for selection. They must be professional and must have
a knowledge of community services available to the client, a certain
level of committment to ensuring just outcomes, have a knowledge
of the relevant law and changes to it, an ability to relate to
clients and work with stress, a desire to enter an ongoing training
regime, an ability to present a plea effectively and have relevant
experience in the area  which is the subject of the service. We
do not believe that tendering of services should merely be a gentleman's
agreement but rather should be subject to a detailed list of demonstrable
criteria.<BR>

<HR>

<P>
<B>In summary, the Federation believes that the best option is
for either a properly resourced LACV duty-lawyer scheme or a duty
lawyer service attached to a Community Legal Centre. Only where
this is not practicable, for instance in isolated country areas,
should a tender/ franchising scenario for private practitioners
 operate and then with tight  quality controls, the type of person
being taken into account along with  training and the meeting
of criteria as outlined earlier.</B>
<HR>

<P>
The Federation also believes that the current practice of tendering
the duty lawyer scheme out to an entire firm of solicitors (particularly
in country areas) detracts from  accountability. Individuals rather
than firms should be enlisted and then accreditation and quality
service can be more tightly controlled. In addition, it is noted
that in the country, often senior experienced solicitors sit in
court waiting all morning for their case to come on whilst a young
lawyer from the same firm acts as duty lawyer.This seems an unecessary
waste of resources. Perhaps practitioners could be requested to
ensure this does not occur. We note that in some of the smaller
courts in the country there is no duty-lawyer scheme at all eg
Horsham&amp;Ararat despite there being a need.
<P>
   
<P>
5. Yes, a review of fees should occur.<BR>

<P>
6. No, services currently provided by duty-lawyers should not
be generally opened up to private practitioners. The standards
outlined in paragraph 4 of this letter for private practitioners
should be the same as those applied to LACV duty lawyers i.e.
accreditation and ongoing training.<BR>

<P>
7. We believe that the issue as to establishing a Family Court
duty-lawyer scheme should not be taken until after a <B>detailed
needs analysis can occur. The outcome of the analysis would help
to determine the form any service would take.</B> Given the complexities
of this jurisdiction as already outlined, we believe that if such
a jurisdiction were taken on by LACV or CLC's they would have
to ensure that the practitioner was experienced in the Family
Law jurisdiction.<BR>

<P>
8. As stated earlier, the answer to this question depends on the
needs analysis. The conditions for franchising and tendering would
need to have specific criteria as outlined in paragraph 4 of this
letter. To tender on the basis of cost alone does not really ensure
access or quality of service in any real sense . As Donald Robinson
states in <I>The Alternative Law Journal</I>, Vol19, No.1 1994,
p. 17, quoting Cappelletti, <I>The Judicial Process in Comparative
Perspective</I>, Clarendon Press, 1989, p.237<BR>

<P>
'There must be 'effective equality and a process in which even
the economically weaker party has a real, rather than a mere illusory,
 opportunity to be heard'<BR>

<P>
9. See paragraph 4and 3 in relation to accreditation and training.
<BR>

<P>
10&amp;11. The Federation is not very familiar with the operation
of the 'On Call ' system but would like to be advised about its
form of operation and provide input.<BR>

<P>
12. The Federation believes accreditation and quality control
in representation in the Children's Court should be along the
lines already outlined in this letter but with added training
focusing on the sensitivities involved in taking instructions
from children and the need for simple language.<BR>

<P>
13. The  Women's Legal Resource Group will provide input on Intervention
Orders as  promised on Monday,17th July. <BR>

<P>
<U>Other Issues<BR>
</U>
<P>
Before concluding there were some other areas which the Federation
is concerned about. As highlighted the duties of the duty lawyer
are often onerous and stressful.We note that particularly in some
metropolitan and rural areas (such as Warrnambool) there are few
facilities for duty-lawyers. They must rely on the good nature
of the Registrar to use a phone, cite an Act, borrow a phone book
etc. We believe that all duty-lawyers should be provided with
the facilities to do their job effectively and given the time
demands already on their hands to enable them to concentrate on
the real tasks at hand. An up to date list of community services
should be on hand. We have heard tales of STD phone bars preventing
consultations with Legal Aid and other like services. We submit
this only makes an already difficult job tougher. <BR>

<P>
We recognise that another difficulty with the provision of duty-lawyer
services is that the on-going stresses result in practitioners
suffering 'burnout'. The training and accreditation procedures
mentioned in this submission may assist in reducing this difficulty
and provide for further support.<BR>
