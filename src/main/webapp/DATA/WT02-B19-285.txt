<CENTER><H3><B>HOUSE PASSES IDEA LEGISLATION<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


At about 4:00 p.m. EST, the full House approved H.R. 3268, the IDEA Improvement Act of
1996.  The House considered the bill under suspension of the rules; a process that prohibits
amendments, limits debate to 40 minutes, and requires a two-thirds majority vote for final
passage.  So, the bill has not changed from the Committee-passed version.<P>

The full Senate may take up the bill this week.  Once a bill is passed, a conference committee --
made up of both House and Senate members -- will convene, and iron out the differences
between the two bills.<P>

CEC will update you as events occur.<P>
