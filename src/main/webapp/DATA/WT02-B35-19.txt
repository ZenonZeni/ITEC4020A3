SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS DISCLOSED FOR OREGON POWER PROJECT

     The gas-supply arrangements for a planned cogeneration facility
in Oregon were among several new transactions disclosed in export-
license applications just filed with the Canadian National Energy
Board.
     Two producer-marketers, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Canstates Gas
Marketing, separately requested Canadian government approval to export
a combined total of 35,000 MMBtu/day for use in the Hermiston
Generating Co. L.P. combined-cycle plant to be constructed at
Hermiston, Ore. Chevron U.S.A.'s supply would be acquired from Chevron
Canada Resources Ltd., its north-of-the-border affiliate. Canstates
would buy its gas at wholesale from Home Oil Co. Ltd.
     In other developments, Renaissance Energy Ltd. of Calgary filed
for authorization to sell and export gas to Bay State Gas Co. and Bay
State's parent company, Northern Utilities Inc. of Westborough, Mass.
Also, Western Gas Marketing Ltd. disclosed that it has scored a new
transborder deal with the Michigan Gas Utilities unit of UtiliCorp
United Inc.
     Officials with Hermiston Generating did not respond to requests
for information. However, a project description submitted to the NEB
says it consists of two side-by-side combustion turbines that will
utilize gas as their primary fuel.

Big new plant

     The plant's nominal primary output will be 300 Mw, divided
equally between the two combustion units. Hermiston submitted a copy
of a long-term agreement to sell electric power produced by the plant
to PacifiCorp, an electric utility based in Portland, Ore.
     A source familiar with the project says as of now, it is not
intended to be a "qualifying facility" cogenerator for purposes of the
Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act; however, the source says, a
local agricultural-products company will purchase waste energy from
the plant.
     The Feb. 28 contract between Chevron and Hermiston specifies a
maximum volume of 20,000 MMBtu over a 15-year period commencing in the
summer of 1996. Transportation to the international border will be
carried out by NOVA Corp. of Alberta and Alberta Natural Gas Co. Ltd.
Carriage downstream of the border will be by a combination of Pacific
Gas Transmission Co. and Cascade Natural Gas Corp. The latter must
construct a delivery tap to serve the power plant.
     The gas price is a netback formula set to start at (U.S.)
$1.61/MMBtu at the wellhead, with annual 5.5% escalators every Nov. 1.
     The April 7 contract between Canstates and Hermiston calls for
15,000 MMBtu/day over the same term as that of the Chevron contract.
Canstates will buy the gas from Home Oil at a point on ANG's system.
Pricing is similar to the terms of the Chevron agreement.
     A Canstates official reports that Canstates's biggest existing
export business is a long-term relationship with Transco Gas Marketing
Co. under which TGMC receives about 120,000 Mcf/day at the Niagara
Falls border interchange. Canstates, which is controlled by ANG,
inherited most of the TGMC supply deal from Sulpetro Ltd., the
official adds.

Other proposed exports

     Renaissance is proposing to deliver 6,423 MMBtu/day to Bay State
under a 10-year contract commencing Jan. 1, 1995. The delivery point
would be Niagara Falls or upstream on the system of TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd., depending on which entity's firm capacity is used.
     NU would get 990 MMBtu/day over a 10-year term commencing Nov. 1,
1995.
     In both contracts, the gas price would consist of monthly demand,
reservation and transportation charges on TransCanada and NOVA plus a
commodity charge for gas based on an index of price reports in three
industry newsletters.
     According to its NEB filing, Western Gas wants to sell a maximum
of 7,241
Mcf/day to MGU at two locations under a 10-year contract retroactive
to Nov. 1, 1993. The contract price would consist of a demand charge,
inventory charge and commodity charge based on a published index.

NO CHANGES DETECTED IN INDUSTRY'S USE OF DERIVATIVES

     There has been no significant slowdown in the use of derivative
financial products by gas marketers, judging by the comments of
officials contacted by GAS TRANSACTIONS REPORT.
     Of four major marketers contacted, two, Tenneco Gas Trading Co.
and Coastal Gas Marketing Co., say they have taken no recent actions
to limit or restrict derivatives usage. Officials with the other two
companies, who declined to speak for attribution by name or company,
also say they haven't put any new trading policies in effect.
     The reason for official reticence is what one source described as
"political concerns" stemming from Congressional and administrative
scrutiny of derivatives usage. In a related event, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board on April 14 issued a proposed rule
requiring more complete disclosure of a company's use of derivatives.

Gas business `a major beneficiary'

     Brian McLaughlin, director of Tenneco Gas Trading, is adamant
about the benefits of derivatives in the gas business and bullish on
the growth outlook for derivatives such as swaps, options, futures and
more exotic hedging instruments. "In a word, no," was his response
when asked whether the company has reined in its hedging practices or
derivatives employment.

     ***********************************************************
     WHAT'S A `DERIVATIVE' DERIVED FROM?

          Derivatives "are complex financial securities whose
     values are derived from other underlying securities," says
     Richard George, a Charlottesville, Va., portfolio manager
     and editor of a newsletter on derivative risk. He divides
     derivatives into three broad types: exchange-listed, over-
     the-counter and structured/hybrid. Exchange-listed deriva-
     tives include futures and options tied to futures, stock and
     currency exchanges. Examples of OTC derivatives are swaps,
     options and forwards. Structured/hybrid derivatives include
     mortgage securities, bonds with warrants, "convertibles" and
     many more newly emerging instruments.
          To date, gas marketers have relied primarily on
     exchange-listed and OTC derivatives. Industry insiders say
     the use of more-exotic hybrids and custom-structured
     derivatives has been limited so far to a small group of the
     industry's most sophisticated traders.
     ***********************************************************

     McLaughlin would not comment about the losses from derivative
trading reported by companies outside of the gas industry. But he
thinks that derivatives -- based on standard agreements "with slight
modifications and negotiations among counterparties" -- are just what
the gas market needs to keep growing and avoid the distortions of the
past.
     "The gas business has been a major beneficiary of the use of
futures and other derivatives," he says. "We see the operations of the
financial side of the industry as a benchmark for the physical side,"
especially by pointing the way toward greater precision in terminology
and standardization of procedures.
     He concedes that derivatives bring greater risk -- and the risk is
growing as traders attempt to make ever-longer derivative-based
transactions. The key to avoiding fiascos of the type that recently
befell MG Corp., Procter & Gamble Co., Marion Merrill Dow Inc. and
others is to cover all foreseeable risks with appropriate hedges, he
says, and if none are available, "don't be in there half-covered."

CGM likes ERMA

     Venita Ferguson, Coastal Gas Marketing's risk manager, reports
that her company is continuing its practice of hedging price
uncertainties with  offsetting derivative products. CGM makes frequent
use of a modified version of the Energy Risk Management Association's
master energy price swap agreement, she says.
     CGM has put no new restrictions on derivatives usage in recent
weeks, Ferguson says. That part of the company's business is growing
with its portfolio of long-term sales, she adds. (FASB, 203-847-0700;

MMS SENDS FEDERAL ROYALTY PAYERS SCALED-DOWN INFORMATION REQUEST

     The Minerals Management Service this month sent a scaled-down
order for gas-contract settlement information to holders of federal
oil and gas leases. The action carries out MMS's side of an agreement
made earlier this year with the Independent Petroleum Association of
America and other industry groups.
     The industry groups had challenged MMS's interpretation of the
application of royalty regulations to contract-settlement payments.
Last June, MMS ordered all federal lessees to submit detailed
information about payments they had received in settlement of gas-
contract disputes. The order came as a wave of take-or-pay settlements
resulting from industry restructuring was winding down.
     IPAA, in conjunction with the American Petroleum Institute, sued
MMS over the June order and sought a preliminary injunction in federal
court against the data collection effort. It agreed to drop the
request for injunction upon issuance by MMS of the revised order.
     The main difference between last year's order and this year's is
that MMS no longer requires lessees to list the federal or Indian
leases involved in each settlement or the proportion of the settlement
attributable to those leases. MMS continues to require that the
federal royalty payers list all settlements taking place after Dec.
31, 1979.

Still may go to court

     As did the old order, the new order requires royalty payers to
give the date of settlement, the producer's name, the purchaser's
name, the amount of the settlement and the date the settlement payment
was received. MMS defines a settlement as "including, but not limited
to... take-or-pay, price deficiencies, buy out or buy down payments,
etc."
     Under terms of the agreement, the associations will not challenge
the latest MMS order. In the near future, MMS will select up to 10
responses for which it will issue an "order to pay." Those cases will
then enter the Interior Dept.'s administrative review process, and MMS
says it expects they will be litigated to determine whether the
government is owed royalties based on the settlement payments. (MMS,
202-208-3983)

STANDARD CONTRACT HAS ALTERNATIVES FOR SITUATIONS OF NON-PERFORMANCE

     As it does with force majeure, a standard gas contract drafted by
a committee of marketing and legal executives provides alternative
clauses for situations in which one party fails to live up to the deal.
     The standard EFP contract offers two alternatives for the article
titled "Failure to Perform," Article 10. The "A" set places the burden
of dispute resolution on both contract parties by calling on them to
"cooperate" to resolve non-performance issues. The "A" set also
provides for more severe penalties for non-performance.

Alternative A: cooperative dispute resolution


ARTICLE X

Failure to Perform

10A.1 Subject to the tolerances set forth in Transporter's tariff,
Seller is obligated daily to Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, and
to deliver to the Transporter which is delivering Gas to the Delivery
Point, and Buyer is obligated daily to Schedule, or cause to be
Scheduled, and to receive, from the Transporter receiving the Gas at
the Delivery Point, the Daily Contract Quantity of Gas at the Delivery
Point agreed to for the Period of Delivery. Both parties hereto shall
also promptly notify each other as soon as possible of any
notification by a Transporter of any imbalances which are occurring or
which have occurred, and they shall cooperate to eliminate such
imbalances including the use of any make-up or balancing rights which
either party may have.
[The requirement to notify the other party of an imbalance situation
could be accomplished by telephone; that possibility, along with the
parties' mutual obligation to "cooperate" on the elimination of an
imbalance, adds up to a fairly broad imbalance remedy.]

10A.2 If either party fails to Schedule the Daily Contract Quantity,
as provided in Section 10.1, that party shall be liable for the
following damages:

(1) If the amount Buyer Scheduled on any day is less than the
applicable Daily Contract Quantity and the Sales Price, as defined in
Section 10.2(3) hereunder, is less than the Contract Price, then Buyer
shall be liable for and shall pay to Seller (a) a dollar amount equal
to any demand charges which Seller has incurred on the Transporter
immediately upstream of the Delivery Point for firm transportation of
Gas which Buyer failed to Schedule and (b) a dollar amount equal to
the sum of the product of (i) the difference between the Contract
Price and the Sales Price the Seller receives, multiplied by (ii) the
difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the quantities
Scheduled by Buyer for each such day during the Period of Delivery.
Receipt of full payment hereunder by Seller shall act to reduce the
Contract Quantity by a quantity equal to the difference between the
original Contract Quantity and the total quantity Scheduled for the
Period of Delivery.
[For example, if the buyer takes 2,000 MMBtu less than the DCQ and the
seller is forced to sell the gas for 10 cents/MMBtu below the contract
price, the buyer must pay the seller $200 per each day it under-takes
plus the pipeline demand charges paid by the seller for firm
transportation.]

(2) If the amount Seller Scheduled on any day is less than the
applicable Daily Contract Quantity and the Replacement Price, as
defined in Section 10.2(3) hereunder, is greater than the Contract
Price, then Seller shall be liable for and shall pay to Buyer (a) a
dollar amount equal to any demand charges which Buyer has incurred on
the Transporter immediately downstream of the Delivery Point for firm
transportation of Gas which Seller failed to Schedule and (b) a dollar
amount equal to the sum of the product of (i) the difference between
the Replacement Price and the Contract Price multiplied by (ii) the
difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the quantities
Scheduled by Seller for each such day during the Period of Delivery.
Receipt of full payment hereunder by Buyer shall act to reduce the
original Contract Quantity by the difference between the original
Contract Quantity and the total quantity Scheduled by Seller for the
Period of Delivery.
[For example, if the seller delivers 2,000 MMBtu less than the DCQ and
the buyer is forced to buy replacement gas for 5 cents/MMBtu more than
the contract price, the seller must pay the buyer $100 for each day it
under-delivers plus the pipeline demand charges paid by the buyer for
firm service.]

(3) The "Sales Price" shall be the price at which Seller is able,
acting in good faith, to make comparable sales at the highest
reasonable price. The "Replacement Price" shall be the price at which
Buyer is able, acting in good faith, to obtain comparable supplies at
the lowest reasonable price. In the event Seller is not able to find a
market for the quantity of Gas within the Contract Quantity not taken
by the Buyer, the Sales Price shall be deemed to be the fair market
price for the Gas not taken, as agreed to by the parties, minus an
amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Contract Price.
[To reach a valid sales price, the parties can resort to some index --
such as closing prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange or spot
prices published in newsletters.]
In the event Buyer is not able to find replacement gas for the
quantity of Gas within the Contract Quantity not delivered by Seller,
the Replacement Price shall be deemed to be the fair market price for
the Gas not delivered, as agreed to by the parties, plus an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Contract Price.
[As was the case with the Sales Price determination, it is left to the
buyers to identify an index for the Replacement Price determination.]

10A.3 If by failing to receive or deliver quantities equal to the
Contract Quantity or by failing to confirm Scheduled quantities,
either party hereto creates an imbalance on a Transporter, such party
shall be solely liable for correcting such imbalance(s), so long as
the parties cooperate to correct the imbalance as provided in Section
10.1. If any such imbalance is not corrected, and charges or penalties
are assessed by a Transporter, the party which caused such imbalance
shall be responsible for any and all such charges or penalties.

Alternative B: independent action

     The second alternative for failure to perform makes each party
primarily responsible for finding a suitable commercial outlet in the
event of non-performance by the other party. In so doing, it
establishes the time limits of that substitute outlet and restricts
the damages that can be collected in the event of non-performance.

ARTICLE X

Failure to Perform
[The following section requires each party to find alternative supply
or buyers in the event of non-performance by the other party, and it
permits the alternative arrangement to continue until the end of the
month it which it was entered into.]
10B.1 If for any reason other than an event of force majeure either
party fails, in whole or in part, to perform its respective obligation
to deliver or take Gas under this Agreement, the other party shall use
its best efforts, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to
mitigate the effect of such failure, which includes attempting to
secure an alternate interruptible supply, or interruptible market, as
the case may be, which allows the defaulting party to resume its
obligation when the defaulting party becomes capable of doing so. If
in so doing, Buyer secures an alternate source of supply and Seller
subsequently regains its ability to deliver Scheduled volumes, Buyer
shall not be required to accept Gas, and Buyer may, without prejudice
to its rights to collect damages from the Seller in accordance with
Section 10B.2 hereof, through the last day of the month in which
Seller's failure to deliver Gas occurs, rely upon the alternate supply
arrangements. If in acting to mitigate its damages Seller secures
alternate markets therefor and Buyer subsequently regains its ability
to accept delivery of Scheduled volumes, Seller shall not be required
to deliver the volumes that the Buyer was previously unable to accept
for delivery, and, Seller may, without prejudice to its rights to
collect damages from the Buyer in accordance with Section 10B.3
hereof, through the last day of the month in which Buyer's failure to
take Gas occurs, continue to deliver to the alternate markets the
nominated volumes of gas that it would have otherwise have been
obligated to deliver hereunder.

[The following section details and limits the damages to which a party
is entitled in the event of non-performance by the other party.]
10B.2 If Seller fails, in whole or in part, to Schedule volumes or to
make Scheduled volumes available to Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement and such failure is not excused by an event of force majeure
or some other provision of the Agreement, the Buyer's right to recover
damages for such failure shall be limited to the following:

(1) If Buyer obtains alternate supplies of Gas, a daily amount equal
to (a) the shortfall in delivery from the Scheduled amount ("Delivery
Shortfall") times the difference between (b) the Contract Price and,
(c) the price Buyer paid for the Gas obtained from an alternate
source. In no event, however, shall the amount of such damages exceed
the amount that would have been payable by the Buyer had the Seller
delivered the Scheduled volumes.

(2) If Buyer does not obtain alternate supplies of Gas, a daily amount
equal to the Seller's Delivery Shortfall times the Contract Price.
Seller agrees to pay Buyer any damages to which Buyer is entitled
hereunder on or before the 15th day after the Seller receives a
written calculation of the amount of such damages from the Buyer.
10B.3 If Buyer fails to Schedule volumes or to take on any day all or
any part of the volumes Scheduled by Buyer hereunder and such failure
is not excused by an event of force majeure or some other provision of
this Agreement, the Seller's right to recover damages for such failure
shall be limited to the following:

(1) If the Seller is able to obtain alternate markets for the Gas the
Buyer fails to take, a daily amount equal to the difference between
(a) the Scheduled volumes for such day and (b) the volumes taken on
such day by the Buyer ("Take Shortfall") times the difference between
(i) the price received by the Seller from the alternate buyer(s) and
(ii) the Contract Price.

(2) If the Seller is not able to obtain alternate markets for the Gas
the Buyer fails to take, a daily amount equal to the Take Shortfall on
such days times the Contract Price. Buyer agrees to pay Seller any
damages to which Seller is entitled in accordance with the above
provisions on or before the 15th day after the Buyer receives a
written calculation of the amount of such damages from the Seller.


      The force majeure aspects of the standard EFP agreement, which
was developed to govern transactions incorporating the exchange of
futures for physicals, were covered in article in the previous GAS
TRANSACTIONS REPORT (4/8 GTR, p. 3). Copies of the standard EFP
agreement can be obtained by calling Shelley Hurley, vice president
for risk management at Equitable Resources Marketing Co. (Equitable
