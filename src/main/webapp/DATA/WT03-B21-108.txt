<A NAME="adhesions"></A>
<B>Adhesion</B>--- Scar tissue occurring in the abdominal cavity, <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A>, or inside the <A HREF="#uterus">uterus</A>. Adhesions can interfere with transport of the egg and <A HREF="#implantation">implantation</A> of the <A HREF="#embryo">embryo</A> in the uterus. 

<A NAME="artificial insemination"></A>
<P>
<B>Artificial Insemination (AI)</B>--- Placing sperm into the vagina, uterus
through artificial means instead of by coitus --- usually injected through a catheter or cannula after being washed. This procedure is used for both donor (AID) and husband's (AIH) sperm. This technique is used to overcome sexual performance problems, to circumvent sperm-mucusinteraction problems, to maximize the potential for poor semen, and for using donor sperm.

<A NAME="catheter"></A>
<P>
<B>Catheter</B>--- A flexible tube used when injecting fluids.

<A NAME="catheterization"></A>
<P>
<B>Catheterization</B>--- Injection of fluid, often into the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A> to determine if they are open. (see <A HREF="#hydrotubation">hydrotubation</A>)

<A NAME="cervix"></A>
<P>
<B>Cervix</B>--- The opening between the <A HREF="#uterus">uterus</A> and the vagina. The cervical mucus plugs the cervical canal and normally prevents foreign materials from entering the reproductive tract. The cervix remains closed during pregnancy and dilates during labor and delivery to allow the baby to be born.

<A NAME="chlamydia"></A>
<P>
<B>Chlamydia</B>--- A type of bacteria that is frequently transmitted sexually between partners or from one an infected mother to her newborn child; the most common sexually transmitted bacteria disease. A disease that may cause impaired fertility by infecting and damaging the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A>.

<A NAME="fertility specialist"></A>
<P>
<B>Fertility Specialist</B>--- A physician specializing in the practice of fertility.
