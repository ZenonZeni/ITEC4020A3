and Abetting Child Slavery</A></B>



</H1><P ALIGN=Left>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Recently you bought your son or daughter a soccer ball.
There is a good chance that the ball was made by someone your child's age
or even younger. Fully half of the soccer balls sold in the United States
are made in Pakistan, and every one of those soccer balls had an assist from
a child under 14 who toils 10 hours a day in subhuman sweatshops, stitching
the ball or cutting material used to make it.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children





worldwide, some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production





line. Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India,





Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human





rights abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children under ages
10-14. These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugs
and countless other products that are flooding the American market and driving





hard-working Americans out of jobs.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>More than 60 years ago the United States banned child labor,





sweatshops, long workdays and workweeks. But now we are subsidizing, encouraging





and failing to criticize the enslavement of young people in the Third World.
The so-called 'Third Wave,' boosted by President Clinton and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich in the form of GATT and the World Trade Organization, prohibits





member nations like the United States from discriminating against the importation





of goods made by children.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much
that they buy them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or
in settlement of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only
four years old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young
son for less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving
loom most of the time, tying tiny knots for 10 hours every day. Carpetmakers
like the young weavers because their small fingers can make very tight knots,
and also because they are cheap to own and maintain. </B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Masih was a free person by the age of 12 and crusaded against





the horrors of child labor. In November 1994 Iqbal spoke on the abysmal





conditions in the sweat shops of Pakistan at an international labor conference
in Stockholm, Sweden. The next month, he was given a Youth Action award in





Boston. Shockingly, in March 1995 he was gunned down in his village in Pakistan





while riding his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman of the Bonded Labor Front,
a group fighting child labor, said, "We know his death was a conspiracy by
the carpet mafia." While Pakistan has laws against child labor and slavery,
the government has taken very little action to combat it. Only a boycott
by the United States and other nations will have any impact on slave-based





industries like the rug manufacturers.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Nike similarly bases its operations on finding the lowest-cost





labor to make its athletic shoes. Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian





sweatshops 70 hours a week making Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of
glue. Blue jeans and cheap clothing made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves
of American shops like K-Mart and Wal-Mart.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>The United States needs to take a leadership role in eradicating





child labor around the globe. If we are pounished for violating GATT for
doing so, let us confront it head on. Child labor is a human rights issue.
What is more of a human right than growing up a free person, attending school





without being shackeld to medieval machinery? </B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label
that says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia,
that a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed
his or her labor to that product. </B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't buy clothing
and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator, Congressman





and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest abuse of human





rights: child labor. And then buy the American-made alternative. It will
make you feel better about yourself and your fellow workers and send the
world and urgently needed message.</B>
