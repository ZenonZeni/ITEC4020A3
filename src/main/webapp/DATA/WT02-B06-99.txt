REP. GOODLATTE ASKS PRESIDENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH ENCRYPTION POLICY

Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), lead sponsor of S.A.F.E., the Security and 
Freedom Through Encryption Act, was joined by Tom Campbell (R-CA), Zoe 
Lofgren (D-CA), Anne Eshoo (D-CA), Bob Barr (R-GA), Eliot Engle (D-NY), and 
a bipartisan group of 21 of their colleagues in the House in writing 
President Clinton asking him not to proceed with his Administration's key 
escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize 
export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products.

&quot;I have received recent information that the Administration is 
circulating yet another version of a key escrow proposal for comments 
from selected individuals.  In my opinion this proposal is a non-starter and 
will not do.  It's just a back door approach for more big government 
intrusion into every American's privacy,&quot; said Goodlatte.
