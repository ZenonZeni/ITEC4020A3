MACHINERY ADVANCES ABET GAINS IN HDPE BLOWN FILM

By:
MICHAEL C. GABRIELE

Spurred by ongoing technical innovations, favorable cost comparisons with
paper and other resin systems, and growing end-use markets, high-density
polyethylene blown film production will register strong annual growth rates
during the next five years.
   North America, Asia, and Latin America are identified as prime growth
markets for HDPE film, while the more mature Western European market is
steady but less robust. Many equipment suppliers say Eastern Europe is
developing as an especially fertile sector for HDPE film growth.

Suppliers project strong growth for HDPE film
   Equipment suppliers are unanimous in their bullish forecast for the
growth of HDPE film. They say many processors, especially those in the
U.S., are set to embark on significant expansion in their production
capabilities over the next 24 months.
   Processors are looking to upgrade the quality of their operations and
film products by utilizing a host of incremental technical innovations.
Many of these capital investments will involve processing lines for
``high-stalk,'' coextrusion high-molecular weight HDPE.
   HDPE film sales in North America are projected to grow at a healthy
average annual rate in excess of 20% during the next five years, sources
say. Much of this increase in business will come at the expense of LDPE and
paper, in various packaging applications.
   An industry source at a major polyolefin resin producer estimates the
total U.S. market for HDPE film in 1995 was upwards of 1.5 billion lb.,
with a value in excess of $1 billion. About 150 billion HDPE film bags were
produced last year for four major market categories: grocery ``T-shirt''
sacks; thin-film industrial can liners; consumer garbage bags; and general
consumer product merchandise bags.
   Eastern Europe is cited by several equipment suppliers as a vibrant
growth sector for the production of HDPE film. Many processors in the
emerging market economies of Eastern Europe are moving aggressively to
invest in high-stalk, coextruded HMW-HDPE film lines, which typically carry
a price tag in excess of $2 million.
   Machinery builders point out that HDPE film's ability to be downgaged
yet maintain physical properties is one factor that will continue to fuel
its growth in both consumer and industrial packaging and insulating
applications.
   ``You can't downgage LDPE or LLDPE like HDPE and still maintain desired
levels of tensile strength,'' David Nunes, president of Alpine American,
Natick, MA, says. ``Also, paper prices are skyrocketing, while the demand
for T-shirt bags is growing at an extraordinary rate.''
   Sources say U.S. paper prices are five times higher than HDPE film in
applications such as T-shirt bags. Recent reports quote the price of 70-lb.
unbleached kraft grocery sack paper at $590 a ton, with supplies tight and
prices expected to continue rising in the near term.

Demand for grooved-feed extruders is picking up
   Joseph Altimari, executive vice president, Black Clawson-Sano Inc.,
Amelia, OH, says his firm's recent marketing alliance with Spanish
machinery builder Covex R.S. Extrusion S.A., of Barcelona, will seek to
capitalize on the growing market demand for grooved-feed extruders for HDPE
blown film. Black Clawson-Sano last spring acquired the exclusive rights to
market Covex HDPE film systems in North America.
   The grooved-feed extruders provide stronger, more consistent, and
predictable extrusion rates compared with smooth-bore types. However,
Altimari points out grooved-feed results in higher wear rates on machines.
To remedy this, Covex has come up with a novel, proprietary groove design
that reduces back pressure and wear in the feed zone.
   Covex film lines utilize an extruder design that reduces screw r.p.m. by
as much as 25 to 50%, compared with existing standard machines, yet
maintains equivalent film output levels, according to Altimari. In
addition, Covex has introduced a bi-layer die design with a single
extruder, which is said to orient HDPE film to help prevent the ``zipper
tear'' effect.
   Paul Kiefel Extrusionstechnik GmbH, Wrentham, MA, and Reifenhauser Inc.,
Peabody, MA, each offer 100-mm. grooved-feed extruders aimed at the T-shirt
bag market. The machines are capable of output rates over 1000 lb./hr.
Alpine is testing a 120-mm. extruder for HDPE, which has been adapted from
an LDPE film system. The design will allow processors to run both HDPE and
LDPE.
   Reifenhauser has unveiled an internal bubble cooling (IBC) technology,
which induces more ``neck-in'' for the stalk or neck of a film bubble.
Matthew Bangert, vice president of sales, explains the IBC system decreases
the neck diameter of the film bubble, just below the frost line. This
enables processors to use larger dies to boost output rates without
sacrificing the desired physical properties of the film.
   Bangert says the technology achieves up to 30% neck-in for the bubble
stalk; the typical neck-in range for most film lines is 5 to 15%.
   Battenfeld Gloucester, Gloucester, MA, recently delivered an enhanced
blown film ``swing'' line to an unnamed U.S. customer, which provides the
capability to change die diameters for the processing of either
high-molecular-weight HDPE or LLDPE.
   Bill Hellmuth, senior product manager, says the new line can switch
between a 17-in. die diameter, for HMW-HDPE, and a 24- in. die diameter for
LLDPE. The unit is equipped with a three-layer die and two extruders: 80-
and 90-mm. The line has a 124-in. nip roll face and an output range of 1000
to 15,000 lb./hr., depending on film thickness.
   Brampton Engineering Inc., Brampton, ON, Canada, has launched its
``Dial-A-Gap'' die gap adjusting system. Bill Wybenga, president, explains
the system isn't an automatic gaging control; it adjusts the total gap
around the die's circumference.
   Wybenga says the system, which can be electronically or manually
operated, allows processors to increase or decrease the nominal film die
gap to suit the needs of the material and the output rate. The gap can be
adjusted in a range of 0.5 to 3 mm. He says that operating with a more
narrow die gap increases the tear resistance and dart impact properties of
the film.
   Alpha Marathon Mfg. Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, has introduced a
spiral die with a ``flow-mixing channel'' to provide a consistent
temperature gradient at the spiral. This provides more exact film gaging,
with improved optical properties and better machine-direction film
orientation.
   An Alpha spokesman explains that each spiral is fed from two ports, and
each port feeds two spirals, which homogenizes the melt entering the
spirals with a thermal layering effect. The screw also incorporates a
special mixing tip.

High-end applications include insulation
   Most sources were guarded when asked to discuss new market areas for
HDPE film. However, indications are that emerging higher-end applications
will involve using the material as a conductive insulator or shield.
   These applications include conductive bags and over-wraps, in areas such
as printed circuit boards, video and electrical cables, and other
electronic products.
   Hellmuth of Battenfeld says his firm is involved in new market
applications, which call for the development of HDPE film lamination. HDPE
film is laminated to a light-gage PE foam, providing conductive insulation
and a protective covering for consumer products.
   Gunther Neumann, a sales representative with Kiefel Inc., Wrentham, MA,
says a well-established trend for new-equipment sales for HDPE film has
been the inclusion of coextrusion capability. He says feedback from
processors indicates they require the flexibility to pair the strength and
downgaging properties of HDPE with the clarity and puncture resistance of
LLDPE.
   Reifenhauser has done proprietary development work with HDPE/LDPE
coextrusions, to produce higher-clarity film. The opacity typically
associated with HDPE is a surface phenomenon. LDPE, as an outer layer to
HDPE, becomes a clarity enhancer.
   Many processors and end users are evaluating the coextrusion
combination of HDPE and metallocenes, sources say. Application trends point
to using a metallocene as a skin layer over HDPE film. This combination
takes advantage of HDPE's superior tensile strength, along with the tear
resistance and enhanced surface appearance of metallocenes.

New oscillating systems are among advances
   Macro Engineering & Technology Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, in March
will begin testing a horizontal oscillating nip on a lab-scale line. A
benefit of the design is a lower head-room requirement in processing
plants, compared with a typical vertical oscillating nip system. It also
eliminates the need to stand film on its edge, which reduces sagging.
   Brendan Dorney, sales engineer, says this design is well suited for the
production of HDPE film. He explains that the horizontal skew bars direct
the film in a scissor-like manner through the 180 or 360 deg. of rotation.
The fixed horizontal bars, like those in a vertical process, use an air
cushion for lubrication.
   Recent innovations from Egan Davis-Standard, Somerville, NJ, are a
94-in. oscillating nip, and European-style surface winder. Rick L. Keller,
industry director of film systems, says the new oscillating nip, introduced
last year, helps reduce gage variations in process, allowing for a more
uniform gage distribution, which results in a flatter, more consistent film
roll geometry. The nip is electrically driven and oscillates 720 deg.
(+/-360).
   The Egan surface winder has been rolled out to meet the demands of U.S.
film processors, many of whom are showing a preference to automatic surface
winders rather than center or turret winders.
   Surface winders long have been considered the system of choice among
European blown film processors. Keller says the Egan winder can handle
rolls up to 50 in. in diameter, and enables processors to achieve a higher
degree of control in the film roll hardness.
   Kiefel's ``light'' mono extrusion line (Compex 60 SA.L), is described as
a lower-cost system for HDPE packaging films. The system includes a
stationary extruder with a standard 23 L/D screw length, an internal bubble
stabilizer with a new high-slip, wear-resistant plastic cone, and dual
irises for external bubble stabilization.

EUROPEAN PROCESSORS NEED SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

By:
JOACHIM ECKSTEIN

   In the processing industry, our philosophy is one where basic standards
and strategies influence our everyday business practices. I believe that in
the past, we concentrated too heavily on the operational side. Only when
confronted with change did we consider new strategies. The changes
confronting our industry were often politically motivated, such as taking
back used products, quota regulations, or collection systems, and were not
related to sensible economic practices. We plastics processors too often
only reacted rather than developed our own independent strategies. Thus,
for example, we were not able to promote politically and publicly supported
waste-to-energy recovery through incineration. Today, only a few European
countries favor this economic and ecologically sound method of waste
management.
   We are confronted in all European countries with varied environmental
regulations at varied costs. The highest fees are found in Germany, to
support the Dual System's (DSD) collection and processing activities.
Recycling a kilogram of plastic costs about $2, three times the value of
the collected material.
   Last year members of the EuPC (European Plastics Converters Association)
reoriented their philosophy and strategy toward the same goals proposed by
European politicians. The EuPC has taken the principles of ``sustainable
development,'' as put forth at the 1992 Rio Conference, as tenets. We see
the fulfillment of Sustainable Development as insuring sustainable
existence for the entire plastics industry. Therefore, when the principles
of European plastics processors coincide with those of European
politicians, future conflicts between political and business goals can be
avoided.

PROFIT NEEDED TO WITHSTAND HARDSHIPS
   European processors are mainly small to medium-sized businesses which
understand that entrepreneurial activities, including ecological aspects,
have be economically viable. All new or additional ecological burdens
placed on our industry have to be both bearable and profitable to insure
the processor's economic survival. So far, this has not been the case. If
we are required to use recycled materials, then these materials should be
sold at rates that correspond to their actual costs.
   There are a number of internal actions we as processors can take to
align ecological measures with our business principles. Resource and energy
reduction, investing in modern technology to ensure better productivity and
low exhaust emissions, as well as sensible use of recyclate are just a few
of the measures we can contribute.
   The products we produce have different life cycles of usefulness. The
higher the quality and better the designs we manufacture, the longer they
can be used - therefore increasing the attractiveness for the customer who
should be willing to pay a higher price.
   By reducing raw material use and building in the collection and
recycling costs at the production stage, we can make our contribution to
improving both the environment and the cost situation.
   Collection, sorting, and recycling of used plastics are today not
covered in the processor's cost calculation. They are usually paid by
municipalities. The goal of the Rio Conference was to transfer these costs
to the producer and seller. This is only possible when a realistic cost
structure allows for a pragmatic cost/sales price ratio to cover the
recycling process.
   The EuPC is not propagating any single form of recycling. Of course,
mechanical recycling, the sole technology which the processor can put into
practice, is only attractive if the costs of collection, separation, and
utilization are under or at the same level as virgin raw material. If the
costs of sorting and cleaning plastics waste make mechanical reprocessing
uneconomical, then other methods such as waste-to-energy recycling should
be considered.
   By orienting our philosophy on the principles of sustainable
development, we European plastic processors want to contribute our part in
keeping plastics, with its outstanding properties, a preferred material.
This should stimulate growth in our industry and create jobs.
   A growth rate of only 1%/yr. in the European plastics processing
industry equates to income of $214 million, which finances 6000 extra jobs.
We thus see sustainable development making a meaningful contribution to all
our social security.

SPI SAYS IT WILL REVIEW PROPOSED RAIL MERGER

   Plans by rail line Union Pacific Corp. to acquire rival Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. are under study by the Society of the Plastics Industry,
to determine how such a consolidation of rail service would affect U.S.
resin shipments.
   The merger would create the largest Class 1 railroad in U.S. history.
SPI says that if the deal goes through, 75 to 80% of all resin produced
between Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA, would be shipped by one company.
This amounts to 39 billion lb. - or 72% - of U.S. resin production.
   SPI is concerned about shipping rates. Transportation is 20% of resin
cost - the second-most expensive cost after raw materials. The group has
until March 29 to file an objection with regulators.
   Union Pacific, which filed notice of the merger Nov. 30 and seeks
approval by August, doesn't believe it will lead to higher prices. ``Lower
transport prices will result over the long run,'' says regional marketing
director Edward Trandahl. He notes 40 plastics shippers in support of the
merger.
   One supplier in favor is Andrew Smith, CEO of polyolefins producer
Rexene Corp. ``We believe the merger will provide more efficient
transportation service.''
   One statistic to emerge from SPI's review is the impact of plastics on
Texas and Louisiana. The industry employs 88,000 in those states, and pumps
$21 billion into their economies annually.

SABIC ADDS PET AND LDPE

   Addition of these resins by Saudi Basic Industries Corp. will make the
company, known by its acronym Sabic, one of the world's most broadly based
resin suppliers by 1996-97. Sabic already produces high-density
polyethylene, linear low-density PE, polypropylene, polystyrene, and
suspension grades of polyvinyl chloride.
   A 310-million-lb./yr. polyethylene terephthalate facility, including
capacity for bottle grades, was due on line late last year. A
770-million-lb./yr. plant for purified terephthalic acid monomer, a PET
precursor, is scheduled for startup in 1997, which would make Sabic
self-sufficient in PET feedstocks (it already makes ethylene glycol).
   The addition of conventional (high-pressure) low-density polyethylene
capacity is due on line in 1997. A 440-million-lb./yr. facility will make
heavy-duty bag, shrink wrap, and other film- and molding-grade resins.
Abdullah Nojaidi, Sabic's president, says that local users in the Middle
East now want their suppliers to provide them with LDPE to complement LLDPE
in blending and other roles.
   While LDPE has been losing share to LLDPE and HDPE for such applications
as films in various regions, it continues to find use in many markets for
the process efficiencies it provides as a blending resin with LLDPE. There
are also many process machines that are configured to run low-density PE,
which are not likely to be replaced or upgraded soon to take LLDPE.
   Sabic is also entering PVC emulsion (paste) supply, with a
50-million-lb./yr. unit just brought onstream. Support facilities to make
di-octyl phthalate plasticizers (using a technology to be licensed from
Japan's Mitsubishi), as well as DOP feedstocks, are also under
construction.

PC SHORTAGE MAY PROMOTE RESIN ALTERNATIVES

   Supply shortfalls, long lead times, and rising price continue to plague
polycarbonate. Several suppliers of PC (and competing clear/tough resins)
say lead times for delivering PC in North America, Europe, and Asia stood
at 8 to 16 weeks in late December. In October, a fourth price hike in six
months went into effect, bringing prices for blow molding grades to US$1.80
to $1.90/lb. for volume buys, a rise of at least $0.30/lb. since
first-quarter 1995. Many accounts are on allocation. (See related article,
p. 67.)
   Users are scrambling to cope. In some markets, where compromise on
clarity is feasible, a shift to lower-cost clear/tough styrenics is
occurring. Blending of PC and other polymers in opaque markets is
increasing, too. Bayer, for example, reports a shift in some markets to
alternative materials in its slate like ABS/PET alloys. The result is that
clear styrenics, like Phillips 66's butadiene-modified grades and Novacor's
acrylic-modified resins, are sold out, with inquiries in medical and other
roles flooding in.
   Indeed, some say a permanent change may be underway in select markets,
as end-users learn to adapt to alternatives that sell for under $1/lb. ``PC
shortfalls create a new mind-set - and a window for replacement,'' states
Steve Shelby, K-Resin commercial manager at Phillips 66, Houston, TX.
Another approach is to send out metallized PC scrap (e.g., from compact
disks), which is usually landfilled, for cleanup by recyclers and
subsequent reuse.
   ``PC today is simply precious,'' a supplier explains. Consultants peg
current PC capacity utilization rates at near 100%. And demand is viewed as
continuing to outrun announced capacity increases through 1996-97,
according to Bill Kuhlke, Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX. PC shortfalls and
high costs could persist until 1998-99, observers say.

LOSS OF GM WORK MAY FORCE SALE AT GENCORP

   GM's switch from sheet molding compound to steel for body panels on the
U-van platform has prompted GenCorp, the supplier of body panels, to
consider selling its Reinforced Plastics Div. Preliminary sale talks are
being held with Cambridge Industries Inc., Madison Heights, MI.
   GenCorp produced lift gates, doors, side panels, and other components
for the all-plastics-exterior U-van in Shelbyville, IN, since 1989.
Production of U-van components will end at mid-year. Parts are also made
there for GM's Camaro, Firebird, and Corvette, Chrysler's Jeep, and Ford's
Ranger.
   Cambridge is a diverse automotive supplier that maintains 11 plants in
the U.S. It produces interior trim, exterior panels, and structural
components.
   Observers say GM switched to steel for economy. The automaker is
redesigning the van for 1997 and anticipates volumes of 300,000 to 400,000,
a production level that is more cost-effective for steel. In 1995, volumes
reached 120,000 for the U-van, which consists of the Lumina APV,
Silhouette, and TranSport models. Only 100,000 units are planned for 1996.

PVC WINS 2, LOSES 1 IN LATEST GO-AROUND

   Proponents of polyvinyl chloride gained ground in two high-profile
regulatory showdowns.
   In Berlin, the city legislature voted down restrictions on vinyl use in
municipal construction, reversing a position that it took five years
earlier. Thus, in Germany's future capital, PVC resumes a familiar role as
a building material in windows, shutters, roof beams, and pipe.
   In Canada, Toronto officials urged legislators to reject an
activist-proposed ban on PVC pipe. Testimony by the industry is credited
with thwarting a citywide ban.
   A setback was encountered in Sweden, where Greenpeace claims victory in
a campaign to have Parliament approve the ``speedy'' phaseout of most PVC
products.

TAIWANESE PRESS MAKER IS AWARDED CE MARK

   Fu Chun Shin Machinery Manufacture Co., in Tainan, says that its 60- to
420-ton injection molding machines now carry the CE mark, a European
quality standard (Dec 95 MP, 23). U.K.-based body Amtri Veritas presented
the company with the certificate.
   According to Pao-Hiun Wang, president of FCS, the company is the first
Taiwanese injection machinery supplier to gain the CE mark. FCS spent a
year upgrading machinery with the assistance of its agent, Excel UK, for
certification.
   The CE mark is a prerequisite for machinery suppliers selling in Europe.
FCS says clients worldwide are requesting machines with the mark, which is
becoming an international safety standard.

GROWTH PROJECTED FOR BLOW MOLDED BULK CONTAINERS IN U.S. AND EUROPE

By:
Michael C. Gabriele

   The U.S. and Europe are emerging as high-growth markets for the
production and sale of blow molded intermediate bulk containers. Demand for
the specialized industrial containers is steaming along at an annual growth
rate of at least 15%, a trend expected to continue over the next five
years. However, the wider use of blow molded IBCs is coming at the expense
of rotationally molded containers.
   IBCs represent a class of large-volume (275 or 330 gal., and 1000 or
1250 liter) industrial containers, with a blow molded tank enclosed and
supported by a tubular steel or welded wire mesh structure.
   A critical boost to the growth of blow molded IBCs occurred in late
1994, when the United Nations passed an international commerce regulation
(HM-181E), which stated blow molded IBCs containing hazardous materials
could be reused. Prior to this ruling, only rotationally molded tanks could
be recycled for the shipment of hazardous materials. The chemical industry
and food processors represent the two major end-use markets for IBCs.

Four major processors are located in U.S.
   Tom Barrett, president of Scheutz Container Systems Inc., North Branch,
NJ - one of four major U.S. producers of blow molded IBCs - notes the
growth of blow molded IBCs is being pulled by solid demand from end users.
``End users see the advantages in more efficient, cost-effective material
handling, and safer overall storage of materials using IBCs, compared with
55-gal. drums,'' Barrett states.
   Hoover Material Handling Group Inc., with three production facilities
(Mount Vernon, OH; Anniston, AL; and Beatrice, NE) is the largest U.S.
producer of blow molded IBCs. John R. Redmond, president, estimates that
his company currently produces nearly half of all blow molded IBCs in the
U.S.
   Other U.S. processors include Sonoco Product Co., Lavonia, GA, and
Scheutz (production installations in North Branch; Atlanta; and
Perrysburg, OH). Sonoco produces blow molded IBCs under a license
technology agreement with Sotralentz, a machinery builder and system
integrator based in Drulingen, France.
   A fourth company, Van Leer Containers Inc., based in Alsip, IL, is
slated to begin production at a plant in Lawrenceville, GA, during the
first half of this year. The firm is a unit of Van Leer Nederland BV,
Amstelveen, the Netherlands.
   Blow molding equipment suppliers for the production of IBCs include
Krupp Kautex Maschinenbau GmbH, Bonn, Germany; the Plastics Machinery Div.
of Cincinnati Milacron, Batavia, OH; Battenfeld Blowmolding Machines Inc.,
Boonton, NJ; Bekum America Corp., Williamston, MI; Ube Industries Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan; and Uniloy Srl, Calenzano, Italy.
Two German equipment builders - Rikutec GmbH, based in Altenkirchen, and
Mauser-Werke GmbH, located in Bruhl - produce their own line of blow
molding machines for commercial sale, as well as process IBCs.
   Hoover operates two Krupp Kautex machines - one in Mt. Vernon and one in
Anniston. Last April, Hoover went on line with a new Bekum unit in Mt.
Vernon.
   Michael D. Hodges, Sonoco market manager, plastics, says his company
utilizes two Krupp Kautex machines at its Lavonia site.
   Sources say there are as many as 15 processors in Europe producing blow
molded IBCs, with the companies concentrated mainly in Germany, France, and
the Netherlands. Scheutz Werke GmbH, Selters, Germany, (the parent firm to
Scheutz Container), and Van Leer are identified as the largest European
producers of blow molded IBCs.
   It's estimated that between 900,000 and 1.1 million blow molded IBCs
were produced and sold in Europe in 1995, according to industry sources. By
contrast, the U.S. market reached just over 400,000 units last year. Both
totals represent a growth rate of 15% compared with the previous year, a
level of average annual increase anticipated to continue for this business
segment through the year 2000, sources say.
   Bob Zendel, Sonoco general manager, says IBCs are developing as a
preferred mode of material transportation, replacing the venerable 55-gal.
drum. Compared with the drums, IBCs are described as being more efficient
containers, in terms of shipping space utilization, handling and storage,
enclosure cleaning and reuse, and material dispensing, he says.

Technical innovations for blow molded IBCs
   The leading-edge technological trend for blow molded IBCs involves the
use of coextrusion techniques. Multilayer tanks can incorporate a
combination of resin systems, or can make use of regrind material,
depending on the application.
   Sonoco and Van Leer this year will initiate production of coextruded
IBCs in the U.S. Sonoco will employ its existing Krupp equipment, while Van
Leer will use a Rikutec machine. Hoover, with its Bekum unit, also will
have coextrusion capability.
   In another development, Hoover recently unveiled its ``Tufftote'' line
of IBCs, which combines an inner HDPE blow molded vessel with a two-part
outer RIM shell. The RIM material is a thermoset olefin (dicyclopentadiene
or DCPD) known as Telene, supplied by BFGoodrich Co., Cleveland, OH. The
result is a freestanding plastics IBC with no metal support frame, which
can be stacked up to three units high.
   Hoover officials say Tufftote IBCs have a 60% lower tare weight
compared with standard metal-caged containers, and eliminate the corrosion
problems commonly associated with metal frames when transporting various
hazardous liquid chemicals.

PEEK GETS PUMPED

By:
Joseph A. Grande

   Metal is slowly taking a back seat when it comes to low-wear and
low-friction applications in the oil refinery and petrochemical industries.
Polyether-etherketone (PEEK) is increasingly being used in stationary and
rotating wear components in centrifugal pumps which are used in oil
refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipeline installations.
   A good example is a new large-scale refinery in Thailand. The builder,
Caltex Corp., Dallas, TX, specified PEEK for the case rings in all the
refinery's process pumps. It may be the first time that a new pump
construction has been specified with non-metallic wear rings, according to
PEEK compounder and processor EGC Corp., Houston, TX.
   In contrast to 410 stainless steel, bronze, or cast iron, PEEK is
non-galling and non-seizing when in contact with other metal-mating
surfaces. The formulation, called Xytrex 451, is a 30% chopped carbon fiber
resin with tensile strength of 17,000 p.s.i. and continuous use temperature
of 350 to 400F. The material has a coefficient of friction that is six
times better than stainless steel, according to the supplier. The
compression-molded rings are 6-in. x 5.5 in. x 1-in.

MANIFOLD MIXING UNIT PUTS A SKIN LAYER ON MOLDINGS

By:
Peter Mapleston

   A small mixing unit that fits between nozzle and mold in injection and
blow molding machines can be used to produce sandwich moldings in which
colorants and other surface-active additives are present only in the skin
layer of the molding. The system was introduced at K'95, and according to
its developers has aroused considerable interest, not only among potential
customers, but also suppliers of additives as well as thermoplastics.
   The Addmix system works with any type of additive in liquid form. One
primary application is colors, but Addmix says the unit is equally
appropriate for such additives as release agents, and even laser-sensitive
additives used in moldings that are subsequently printed by lasers (Aug 95
MP, 28).
   As of January, the London-based company will supply off-the-shelf
manifolds that attach to the back of each mold. The additive is mixed into
the polymer melt between the end of the injection barrel and the mold. By
selective addition of the additive into the first part of the shot - the
part which becomes the skin layer of the molding - processors can cut down
on their additives consumption by as much as 80%, depending on the geometry
of the part. Users can adjust the volume of melt into which the additive is
mixed, over a limited range.
   Use of the manifold does not affect production cycle times. Although no
details are available on the design and the means of mixing the additive
into the melt, company director Simcha Kilim describes the manifold as a
``form of hot-runner manifold.'' He says it does contain a non-rotating
moving part connected to the injection head. ``It does not affect the
regular behavior of the machine,'' he says. Additive is metered to the
manifold using a simple peristaltic pump that delivers constant pressure.

System helps molders save money, material
   Kilim says that although it might appear at first that additive
suppliers would hesitate to embrace a technology that will reduce their
sales, companies supplying additives with low degradation temperatures are
interested because the Addmix manifold submits the additives to little
thermal and shear stress.
   The Addmix system can be used in various ways. The company's main
interest is in skin molding, and around the middle of next year it will
introduce a version for multiple-cavity molds that enables selective
coloring (diagram). In this system, melt is split into two streams, and
each stream can be mixed with a different color.
   A manifold suitable for linking to a mold with a cavity around 200 cu.
cm. costs around $8500 (5000). Addmix says that money can be recouped in a
few months. It cites savings possible with a typical polymer with a base
cost of $0.865/lb.
   A yellow compound containing 1.5% additive priced at $10.468/lb. costs
$1.009/lb. In production of a part with a 3-mm. wall thickness, the Addmix
system can be used to give a skin layer of 0.5 mm. (1 mm. total). If the
color in the skin layer is added at 2% for security, the total cost for
material in a part weighing 1 lb. is $0.927, giving a saving of $0.08/lb.
of processed material. The savings are even more stark when more exotic
colors, some of which cost over $70/lb., are used.

MD&M-WEST CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS DESIGN REGULATION

By:
Merle R. Snyder

   Regulatory issues, technology advances, and global business
opportunities will be the focus of attention as participants from the U.S.
and about 30 other countries gather for the 12th annual Medical Design &
Manufacturing (MD&M) West conference and exhibition, Feb. 6 to 8, at the
Convention Center in Anaheim, CA. About 800 exhibitors are expected to
occupy 112,000 sq. ft. of space.
   An early session, Feb. 5, conducted by representatives of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), is billed: ``GMP (good manufacturing
practices) Design Controls and the New 510(k) Environment - a Regulatory
Update.'' Visitors may also sign up for 15 minutes of free consultation
with industry and regulatory agency experts in the ``Meet the Experts''
forum.
   The new GMP rule has been designed for compatibility with the
quality-systems philosophy of the International Standards Organization
(ISO) 9000 series of international standards. Manufacturers that properly
implement design controls can also reduce their product liability exposure
and minimize product development costs. The session will include discussion
of the new 510(k) guidelines' impact on device marketing.
   Specific topics to be addressed include implementation timing for
specific design controls; component, labeling, and packaging design
controls; design input, verification, and output; biocompatibility
considerations; and proper preparation of a 510(k).
   Also on Feb. 5, is a tour of the R&D and clean-room assembly operations
of Gish Biomedical, Irvine, CA. Gish manufactures medical devices used in
cardiovascular and orthopedic surgery, orthopedic and thoracic autologous
blood recovery and reuse systems, and vascular access products for extended
home-care infusion therapies. Tour participants will have the opportunity
to meet with researchers, product designers, manufacturing engineers, and
corporate management in the course of the tour of the 150,000-sq.-ft.
production facility.
   Speakers in a Feb. 6 session on clinical trials will discuss the use
of human subjects to determine a product's efficacy and marketability,
while focusing on such issues as investigational device exemptions (IDEs),
FDA regulations, effective clinical trial design, difficulties in
conducting trials, and alternative techniques for overcoming problems.
   In a partnership that is now entering its third year, the Medical
Plastics Div. of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) is presenting a
Regional Technical Conference (Retec) in an all-day session Feb. 7,
concurrent with the MD&M West event. Hosted by Exxon Chemical's Robert
Portnoy, and chaired by Udayan Patel of Advanced Cardiovascular Systems,
the session is billed ``Application of Plastics to Medical Devices:
Problems and Solutions.''

Molders, designers seek global opportunities
   International considerations loom ever larger in the medical device
business. International standards-setting groups are creating a wide range
of global standards regarding clean-room and aseptic processing and
packaging. A session on Feb. 8, instructed by Anne Marie Dixon, managing
partner of a clean room consulting firm, will discuss the work of ISO's
Technical Committee 198.
   Also on Feb. 8, speakers will address opportunities in Japan, greater
Asia, Taiwan, Europe, and Latin America in a session entitled ``Global
Expansion: International Opportunities for Medical Device Manufacturing
Companies.''
The market for medical devices and supplies in China is expected to surpass
$1 billion this year. The country is therefore the focus of a session to
include presentations by officials of the Ministry of Health, People's
Republic of China, including: an ``Overview of the Chinese Health-Care
System''; ``Hospital and Clinical Needs for Medical Devices''; and
``Reimbursement Policies and Cost Containment.''
   U.S.-China government initiatives will be discussed by Paul E. Barry,
international trade specialist, Office of Microelectronics, Medical
Equipment, and Instrumentation, International Trade Administration, at the
U.S. Dept. of Commerce.
   MD&M West is sponsored by Medical Device & Diagnostic Industry magazine,
published by Canon Communications Inc. For information, call (310)

ORGANIC PEROXIDES FACE STIFF TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETITORS

By:
Gordon Graff

   New technologies for producing and modifying polymers are posing a
formidable challenge to organic peroxides as the additives of choice in a
number of traditional high-volume areas.
   According to industry observers, peroxides are still secure in such
current applications as initiators for vinyl polymerization, curing agents
for thermoset resins, and crosslinking agents for elastomers and PE. But
they say that fast-rising competitors like metallocene catalyst technology
and electron beam processing could eventually edge out peroxides in their
present roles as rheology modifiers for PP and as initiators for production
of LDPE.
   In the modification of PP, ``metallocenes definitely have an advantage
over peroxides,'' says consultant John Murphy of The Catalyst Group, Spring
House, PA. Right now, peroxides are often used to degrade PP in a
controlled fashion, after it emerges from the reactor. This
``vis-breaking'' produces a polymer with a relatively narrow molecular
weight (MW) distribution, a feature that improves its melt flow properties
during processing. But metallocene catalysts have the ability to produce PP
right out of the reactor with the requisite narrow MW distribution. Such
polymers in principle should need no post-reactor peroxide treatment.
   There is little uncertainty in the minds of metallocene polymer
producers. Malcolm Kaus, Exxpol venture manager at Exxon Chemical, Houston,
TX, declares flatly that Exxon's recently commercialized metallocene PP
technology ``will greatly diminish, if not eliminate, peroxide use'' in the
treatment of PP. ``Of course this is only a projection,'' he adds, ``and
I'm not sure in what time frame this will be realized.''
   Besides Exxon, other developers of metallocene-based PP include Hoechst
AG, Frankfurt, Germany; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; and Japan's Mitsui
Toatsu, Tokyo.

Metallocene claims concern peroxide makers
   Peroxide producers are taking the metallocene competition seriously.
``We're definitely concerned about claims'' that metallocenes will displace
peroxides, says R. Gerald Gimbarski, business manager for organic peroxides
at Elf Atochem, Philadelphia, PA. ``I agree that metallocenes could be a
threat,'' adds Ronald Pastorino, market manager for organic peroxides at
Witco Corp., Greenwich, CT, although he says that any challenge is not
likely to materialize for ``several years.''
   Electron beam (E-beam) processing is also presenting a frontal challenge
to peroxides. E-beam processors claim that their systems have advantages
over peroxides in such applications as crosslinking rotationally molded PE
storage tanks and curing the resin in PE water tubing. For example, Karen
Butler, marketing director at E-Beam Services, Cranbury, NJ, points out
that peroxides, which are temperature-sensitive, are not compatible with
high shear rates or the process temperatures required for high line speeds
and thin-walled or intricately shaped products, whereas E-beam curing can
be used in these applications. She adds that E-beam allows more precise
control of crosslinking density than peroxides or other chemical curing
agents.
   One drawback of E-beam systems is that fabricators, who seldom wish to
invest in an E-beam facility on their premises, typically have to ship
their uncured objects to a distant processor. On the other hand, the extra
transportation costs are reduced by the savings from eliminating peroxides
in the formulation.
   Despite stiff competition from other technologies, peroxide makers are
continuing to innovate. At Elf Atochem, Gimbarski points to two recent
introductions under its Lupersol line of organic peroxides. These products,
grades 610-M50 and 688-M50, are hexylene glycol peroxyesters that serve as
low-temperature, fast front-end initiators in the production of polyvinyl
chloride. They are intended to speed up polymerization cycle times.
   The 610-M50 grade is also the first new peroxide additive approved in
the U.S. in 12 years not required by the Environmental Protection Agency to
carry a warning label of carcinogenic hazards. Elf avoided the label by
submitting voluminous safety testing data to EPA.

LIQUID COLORANTS ARE FREE OF OLD DRAWBACKS, GAIN IN POPULARITY

By:
Gordon Graff

   Liquid colorants, which were once confined to a small niche in the
injection molding business, are now competing head-on with traditional
color concentrates and other solid systems in high-volume extrusion and
extrusion blow molding markets. Behind this trend are technical advances
over the past five years that have made liquid colorants more reliable and
economical for many applications than pellet concentrates and other solid
colorants.
   In particular, improved carrier vehicles have made liquid systems
compatible with just about all thermoplastic resins, and a new generation
of highly accurate liquid dispensing pumps now offers consistent color
quality in fabricated products. The high concentrations of pigment in the
latest liquid systems also enhances their economic appeal for processors.
   The liquid colorants industry received a big boost earlier this year
when Rubbermaid Inc., Wooster, OH, one of the country's largest plastics
processors, decided to switch from solid colorants to liquid systems in
many of its plastics fabricating operations. Details of the switch are
sketchy, and Rubbermaid declines to comment on it. But according to one
industry observer, the move will be ``very influential'' in convincing
smaller processors to adopt liquid systems.

Business is booming for colorant pump suppliers
   While there are few estimates of the size of the liquid colorants
market, suppliers of both the colorants and the dispensing pumps often sold
with them report that business is booming. ``Sales of liquid colorant pumps
have more than doubled for us this year,'' says B. Patrick Smith, vice
president for marketing and sales at Maguire Products Inc., Media, PA, one
of the leading suppliers of dispensing equipment for liquid systems. And
Michael R. Shaughnessy, president of ColorMatrix Corp., Cleveland, OH, a
supplier of liquid colorants, estimates that such products are growing
``significantly faster'' in the U.S. than the plastics colorants business
as a whole.
   Despite their inroads into extrusion applications, liquid systems are
still concentrated heavily in injection molded products. According to one
industry observer, liquid colorants now account for 20 to 25% of the
colorants used for injection molded products in North America.
   By most accounts, use of liquid colorants is far more widespread in
North America than Europe. In explaining this disparity, industry sources
cite the fact that many European pigment manufacturers also make color
concentrates, which have well-entrenched markets. Elsewhere, pigment makers
are more independent and thus freer to experiment with new formulations.
Nonetheless, liquid systems are catching on in Europe. In fact, new
business there has been so brisk that ColorMatrix recently opened a
manufacturing plant near Liverpool, England, to address the market.
Meanwhile, interest in liquid colorants is said to be particularly strong
in Latin America.
   Liquid colorants have come a long way from their first appearance in the
late 1970s, when incompatibility between their liquid carrier vehicles and
many thermoplastics caused slippage of extruder screws. Many formulations
were also slow to disperse in melted resins, and liquid dispensing
equipment was often inaccurate or costly.
   Today's liquid carriers - their compositions are well-guarded trade
secrets - are compatible with most polyolefin, styrenic, and engineering
resins; screw slippage is largely a thing of the past. Better milling
procedures are producing very fine pigment particles that make liquid
colorants easier to disperse than competing dry powdered colorants and even
the liquid colorants of just a few years ago.

Dispensing units are more accurate, less expensive
   Perhaps the most significant factor responsible for the growing
popularity of liquid colorants is the accurate and inexpensive dispensing
pumps that have recently come to the fore. These pumps are portable and
generally cost between $1000 and $2500. Liquid colorants are often
formulated for particular dispensing machines. In fact, such liquid
colorant suppliers as Ferro Corp., Edison, NJ, and Morton International,
Chicago Heights, IL, also offer their customers dispensing machinery.
   Although they differ in details, most current liquid color dispensing
units feature a peristaltic pump, in which liquid is released by periodic
compression and release of a flexible pumping tube by a series of rollers.
The rollers are driven by a variable-speed, microprocessor-controlled
motor. Precise metering is achieved by automatic counting of each rotation
of the motor, which is set to deliver a known amount of liquid per
rotation. The liquid colorant always remains inside the feed tube and never
comes into contact with the rollers or any other part of the pumping
mechanism. As a result, color changeovers can be rapid.
   The colorant feed tube usually enters injection or extrusion machines in
one of two locations: immediately below the hopper at the feed throat, or
into a groove machined into the base of the barrel. Both configurations
promote rapid mixing of colorant and resin in the barrel and an even
distribution of color in extruded or molded articles.
   While liquid colorants usually cost more on a unit basis than powders or
pellet concentrates, they are so concentrated (typically 75% pigment
loadings) that they are often more economical to use than competing
products.
   Despite the favorable economics, liquid colorants have been slow to
penetrate some applications. Blown film is one such area, because liquid
systems are less efficient than the concentrates in achieving required
levels of opacity in very thin films.
   Meanwhile, suppliers of liquid colorants are unveiling grades for
special applications. For example, Riverdale Color Manufacturing, Brooklyn,
NY, is developing liquid colorants for use with ABS resins.
   Overall, growth of liquid colorants during the next year is expected to
remain strong. Among the reasons, notes Riverdale Color president Charles
Irish, are recent price hikes for polyethylene, polypropylene, and other
carrier resins used in pellet concentrates. Because of the resulting run-up
in concentrate prices, he says, ``more processors may entertain switching
to liquids.''

AUG 95 MP, 15

   An article about machinery supplier Starlinger & Co. indicated that
three years ago it bought, then sold, fellow Austrian company Maplan
International (Aug 95 MP, 15). In fact, although Starlinger bought the
entire Maplan International business, encompassing twin- and single-screw
extruders and rubber processing equipment, it only subsequently sold the
twin-screw business (to Theysohn Extrusionstechnik, also of Austria). It
retains the remaining businesses. Starlinger has never had any holding in
American Maplan, which was separate from Maplan Int. and which was recently
acquired by the Battenfeld Group.

PLASMA POLYMERIZATION USED FOR SCRATCH-RESISTANT COATINGS

By:
Robert Colvin

   Researchers at Germany's Institute for Plastics Processing (IKV),
Aachen, have come up with an innovative process to coat injection molded
polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylate optical parts to obtain high
scratch resistance. This high-density process - a vacuum-coating method
which produces a glass-like surface - is performed at relatively low
temperatures in a microwave bath. IKV scientists are predicting the
technique can eventually be used to economically coat any size surface.
   Its specific advantage is that properties of the polymer layers
deposited on the plastic can be modified through selective process control
and aligned to a range of requirements such as crosslinking and the ability
to withstand chemical and mechanical stresses. This coating is free of
micropores, has an amorphous layer structure, and offers good adhesion,
even to nonpolar surfaces.
   Previously used methods for applying coatings include painting them on
the lens surface, which carries the drawback of dust contamination and ion
plating, and allows only low scratch resistance over small areas and
entails long process times. Plasma-aided evaporation is another option.
Here, clean-room conditions are needed, as well as resources to deal with
solvent-laden air.
   Plasma polymerization's adhesive qualities are obtained through a form
of process control which involves the formation of coupling agent layers
during coating. These layers are aligned to the substrate being used. By
varying the process parameters, it is possible for the hardness of the
interface layer to be further tailored.
   To obtain adequate scratch resistance as determined by the sand drop
test (DIN 52348-1) on PC, a coating of 6 micron is needed. The coating rate
is up to 2 micron/min., 50 times higher than plasma-aided evaporation
systems, says IVK's Harald Zell.
   IKV engineers have developed a plant concept for the production of
large-area coatings. So far they have been able to apply plasma
homogeneously over a width of 500 mm. at a deposition rate of 0.2
micron/min.
   Apart from transparent, scratch-resistant coatings, plasma
polymerization may find other applications. Since the surface tension of
the coatings can be selectively varied, hydrophobic layers can be employed
as anti-stick coatings. With hydrophilic coatings, good anti-misting
properties can be obtained, since droplets of water on the substrate
spontaneously form a transparent film which doesn't scatter light. IKV
researchers say anti-permeation coatings for PE fuel tanks are also on the
horizon.

CONNECTOR MARKETS FACE DECADE OF HIGH RISKS AND BIG REWARDS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   At first glance, today's fast-emerging information age looks like a
bonanza for some 500 companies worldwide that mold electronic connectors,
and for their materials and equipment suppliers. Indeed, overall resin use
should continue to grow at about 10%/yr. Yet the breakneck speed of
technological change in the varied end-markets that use connectors is
disconcerting.
   In fact, the connector industry faces a tough, risky decade ahead as it
copes with expanding yet swift-changing demands by multinational giants who
manufacture computer, business machine, wireless, cellular phone,
automotive, and other electronic systems, and which in turn depend on
connectors.
   Ongoing evolution in electronics makes it difficult to understand or
predict market needs, according to a study to be issued in early 1996 by
Fleck Research, Santa Ana, CA. The consultant is estimating global unit and
polymer use rates for some 700 distinct connector segments through 2005.
   A central dilemma is that the exploding demand for the number of
connector units worldwide coincides with miniaturization and integration of
the devices. Fewer, smaller connectors eventually can mean less resin use
for each application. Also, miniaturization intensifies the performance
requirements for both the connectors and resins selected to make them.
   Miniaturization of connectors is driving designers to more
lightweighting and precision, higher flame-retardancy ratings, and higher
operating temperatures as compared to the past, says Ken Fleck, coordinator
of the study. This opens new opportunities for resins like liquid crystal
polymer.

Connectors claim 600 million lb. of resin
   World connector markets attract captive and custom producers that
include major global technology powerhouses (table). In 1995, world
thermoplastics use in connectors hit 600 million lb., according to the
Fleck report. This includes about a 10 to 15% fraction of thermosets
(mainly phenolic).
   Thermoplastics in connectors tend to be high-performance, high-value
materials. Most cost about $1.60 to $2.27/lb.; a fifth cost $2.27 to
$9.10/lb.
   Polyamides and thermoplastic polyesters are the most widely used
polymers, followed by polyphenylene sulfide, PC, and liquid crystal
polymers.
   The U.S. is the largest regional market, with a global share of 35%, or
210 million lb. Its largest end-use markets are data communication, phone,
wireless, computer, and automotive systems.
   Western Europe and Japan each have roughly 25% of the world market for
connectors, with a dozen Pacific Rim nations supplying another 10%. Shifts
in automobile production (e.g., to the Far East, Eastern Europe, and Latin
America) in recent years have made automotive connectors more widely used
there. They come in tiers used in the engine (e.g., anti-lock brakes) and
passenger compartment (seat belts), having quite different requirements.
   Global demand for connector units is exploding. The report estimates 50%
more connector units will be sold in the U.S. in the next five years, from
20 billion to 30 billion units. But profiting from this expansion may be
less than easy for molders and materials suppliers.

Challenges come with changing electronics
   The composition of connector markets is changing in lockstep with
changes in electronic products. For instance, 65% of the computers sold in
1995 in North America were desktop models, and 9% were workstation models.
But this 74% segment of computers consumed 90% of connector units and 96%
of resin.
   A decade from now, the market is expected to shift to notebook and
handheld computers, which tend to use fewer, smaller connector units. In
1995, these categories made up 25% of computers, but used only 4% of
resin.
   Another escalating design requirement is increases in the density of
pins (i.e., number per sq. in.), and increases in the pitch of pins and
connectors. Additionally, smaller connector designs generally involve lower
shrinkage rates, thinner walls, and more precise processing.
   The types of polymers used in connectors is in flux as a result of these
pressures. For example, Woo Young, Pyungtaek, South Korea, recently
switched a 300-pin connector for telephone exchanges to a nylon 46 from DSM
Engineering Plastics, Sittard, The Netherlands. The Stanyl material
replaces cross-linked PPS, and is said to offer problem-free insertion,
high pin-retention, and soldering resistance to 260C.
   At the same time, new versions of PPS, including linear grades made by
Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, are replacing polyesters in some roles.
A strong shift from thermosets to thermoplastics is also underway, Fleck
reports.


                Global leaders in thermoplastic
                   connectors face a major
                   technological challenge*

POLYPROPYLENE SHOWS ITS METTLE IN TEXTILE DYE-TUBE DESIGN

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Compressible dye-tube moldings illustrate how designers can use plastics
to enhance manufacturability, consolidate parts, and reduce material waste.
The cylindrical, lattice-walled, spring-like devices, injection molded in
PP by Technimark Inc., Randleman, NC, compress 40% when under high-speed
load, yet resist crushing.
   The necessary balance of flexibility and strength, along with desired
thermal and chemical resistance, are provided by PP resins supplied by
Epsilon Products, Marcus Hook, PA.
   PP dye tubes are rapidly replacing stainless steel versions in the U.S.
for high-speed winding of polyester and PP yarns through 270 degress F. dye
baths. The devices incorporate molded-in fins that allow the yarn to be fed
directly from the item to the subsequent weaving or knitting steps in
textile-making. Moreover, a three-fold transfer of yarn to separate metal
and paper tubing pickup devices (a process called ``backwinding'') is
bypassed. These previously needed steps had added to labor costs, generated
considerable tubing waste, and degraded fiber quality.
   The spring-like behavior of the PP devices in effect increases the
effective capacity of costly dye baths by 40%, and reduces chemicals and
water use. In 1995, Technimark expected to mold 30 million of the
lightweight (0.25 lb.) parts for the U.S. market, where a rapid transition
to PP is underway.
   Mike Pembroke, Epsilon's sales director, asserts that the application
``extends the envelope of PP design capabilities.'' Technology and know-how
for processing the complex, high-tolerance part is licensed by Joseph
Zimmerman, Aachen, Germany.
   Technimark has adapted the tube design for the U.S. Two- and four-cavity
molds are used; cycle times are 10 to 14 sec. The processor has designed in
stop buttons to prevent overcompression of tubes. Machines used are 400-ton
Van Dorn HT units. The disposable dye tubes can be reused in PP
furniture.

EXPORTS AND LOW MONOMER COST KEEP SUPPLY AND PRICING STABLE

By:
Robert Colvin

   Subdued buying by processors and a quarter-by-quarter drop in the cost
of ethylene monomer helped to keep polyethylene prices last year from
rising to what many producers would have termed an acceptable rate. Bad
news for the producers, no doubt, but good news for processors, especially
after 1994, which saw some of the steepest price run-ups for PE in recent
years.
   Though manufacturers are banking on low customer inventories helping to
stimulate buying in the first quarter of this year, chances are that prices
will remain pretty much where they were at the end of 1995.
   In North America, for example, fourth-quarter polyethylene prices ranged
from 37 cents/lb. for blow molding grades of high-density PE, to 40
cents/lb. for low-density PE liner grades. These levels were down
substantially from second-quarter 1995, when the average price for blow
molding grades of HDPE topped out at 50 cents/lb. and liner-grade LDPE hit
48 cents/lb.
   Moreover, in North America, ethylene monomer prices began the year at 31
cents/lb. and finished 1995 at 21 cents/lb.

North American pricing affects global resin costs
   Not surprisingly then, North American LDPE prices are considered to be
very competitive vis-a-vis those of other exporting regions on the global
market. According to McGraw-Hill's Platt's Polymerscan, a pricing service
in London, offshore resin sources continue to exert an influence on global
pricing. In Western Europe, imports, though slowing, remain a factor in the
price structure of resin. Asian prices have weakened as a result of high
availability from a variety of sources, according to Platt's Hazel Marlow.
   Among the various PE types, consultants note that HDPE inventories
remain high and export sales show no signs of taking off. They attribute
this to direct competition in film applications with linear low-density PE,
which itself is hit by overcapacity.
   Change might be in the offing in 1996, however. Advances in HDPE film
process technologies and blown film extrusion lines, coupled with
price-driven gains in large-volume markets like T-shirt bags, bode well for
the resin's use in many areas, notably, Western Europe and North America
(see story, p. 44).
   Compounding the situation for PE producers is market agitation in
Europe. Investigators acting on European Commission orders swooped down
late last year on corporate offices of manufacturers Borealis, BASF, BP,
DSM, Dow, Shell, Petrofina, Hoechst, Solvay, and Polimeri Europa, over
allegations of possible illegal cartel operations in pricing. The
investigation, which is still underway, appears to have been prompted by
complaints from processors and buyers stemming from limited supplies early
last year, allegations of price fixing, and possible restrictive
competitive practices.

Formulation advances upgrade properties
   Prices and politics aside, polymer technology is sparking optimism with
regard to properties enhancements. DSM, Sittard, the Netherlands, has come
up with an injection molding grade of LLDPE, Stamylex, which offers high
purity and a narrow molecular weight distribution.
   London-based BP Chemicals and Germany's Hoechst, Frankfurt, have come
out with a range of grades (rated as PE 100) for high-pressure water, gas,
steam, and industrial pipes.
   Not to be outdone, both HDPE market leader Solvay, Brussels, Belgium,
and Borealis, Lyngby, Denmark, introduced at K'95 third-generation grades
for similar applications (rated PE 80 and PE 100).
   The high-pressure pipe grades are, for the most part, bimodal.
   Hoechst is also eyeing future applications that will take market share
from other materials with its HDPE. Key among them is the hoped for
switch-over by Germany's mineral water producers from glass to polyethylene
terephthalate bottles, and the resulting demand for new bottle crates as
well as substitution of aluminum caps by HDPE caps.
   Even machine manufacturers are getting into the act by upgrading
extrusion lines for HDPE. Increases in competitive materials' prices and
waste-management costs have allowed HDPE film to make important inroads
into the film market through its down-gaging properties. Reifenhauser,
Troisdorf, Germany, for example, is designing better certain of its lines
to fit the polymer's characteristics.
   New capacity coming on stream includes production for specialty grades.
One example is the new Borstar technology for manufacturing
enhanced-property bimodal PE, which went into commercial operation at the
end of last year in a 264-million-lb./yr. plant run by Borealis in Porvoo,
Finland.
   Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, has a new Unipol PE gas-phase
LLDPE/HDPE unit, with a capacity of 480 million lb./yr., set to start up at
the end of 1996 in La Porte, TX. At the same site, the company will
maintain its 85-million-lb./yr. LLDPE unit dedicated to making rotational
molding resins. By the end of June, it will also have restarted a
250-million-lb./yr. Unipol reactor at Morris, IL. Another Unipol LLDPE
reactor at the site will be debottlenecked to raise capacity by 100 million
lb./yr. to a total of 400 million lb./yr.
   In a final move, Quantum has plans to convert its dedicated LLDPE
reactor at Port Arthur, TX, to a dedicated HDPE unit using BP technology
offering a capacity of 300 million lb./yr. Work is slated for completion by
October.
   Other suppliers are also increasing capacity. Montell, Wilmington, DE,
has started up a 440-million-lb./yr. PE plant at Lake Charles, LA, using
its Spherilene process technology.
   Dow Plastics, Midland, MI, plans to debottleneck an LDPE plant in
Sarnia, ON, Canada, and an LLDPE train located in Fort Saskatchewan,
Canada.
   Polimeri Europa, the Enichem/Union Carbide joint venture, in Milan,
Italy, will build a 400-million-lb./yr. Unipol swing reactor for HDPE and
LLDPE in Brindisi, Italy.
   Meanwhile, several companies say plants are scheduled for construction
in Brazil, India, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and parts of Southeast Asia and
China.
   While few plans exist for deactivating plants, Dow Plastics recently
announced it is shuttering a slurry HDPE facility in Sarnia, ON, Canada,
with a nameplate capacity of 160 million lb./yr.
   Konrad Scheidl, former PE manager at Dow and now market analyst with
Maack Business Services, in Au, Switzerland, sees one affect of all this
new capacity on the market, especially that using swing technology to
produce either LLDPE or HDPE: loss of share by LDPE. These swing-capacity
resins are making rapid penetration in the film market because of HDPE's
downgaging qualities and alpha-olefin-comonomer LLDPE's improved tensile,
heat seal, and impact strength, and high miscibility. LLDPE is calculated
by Maack to overtake HDPE this year in capacity growth, and to surpass LDPE
in 1998.
   Peter Toohy, manager of plastics sales for Chevron Chemical, Houston,
TX, says he doesn't see LDPE rolling over and yielding market share so
easily. The resin is in big demand in countries where LLDPE is readily
available, but where processing equipment and expertise have not reached
the levels of North America or Europe, he says.
   Rob van Ooijen, PE manager at DSM, agrees. He adds that to compensate
for difficulties in processing LLDPE, an addition of 10 to 40% of LDPE can
act as a blending agent. Thus, some plants that run LLDPE may still need
low-density grades for processability. DSM is one of the few companies to
make recent investments in LDPE facilities. Van Ooijen says production has
been sold out.
   This year Union Carbide, Danbury, CT, is launching Ultra Tuflin, a
hexane-based LLDPE aimed at replacing LDPE. It reportedly offers up to 110%
more machine-direction tear strength (at 89 micron) than existing
higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE's.

RESINS REPORT 1996
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDING MARKETS

   This is a dynamic time in resins supply. On one hand, technology is
expanding the properties and applications potential of materials. On the
other, burgeoning demand in developing countries is creating a huge market
for plastics, while influencing supply and pricing around the world.
   For processors, these trends signal opportunity and challenge. As the
following articles indicate, the capabilities of plastics design have never
been greater. New technologies, grades, and application concepts increase
market penetration.
   But growth can be difficult. The runup in demand for resins last year,
much of it influenced by inventory buying to offset shortages, stretched
production to the limit. Some resins remain in tight supply. New capacity
is coming on line, though, and 1996 is seen as a year of more balanced
supply and demand. Prices, moreover, should be relatively stable for most
resins.
   Modest economic growth is forecast for most of the industrialized world.
This should assure steady if unspectacular gains in resin consumption. In
developing countries, GDP growth and resin consumption will stay at
double-digit rates.
   This year will be one in which innovative technologies and expanding
markets define plastics use. With no major economic problems on the
horizon, and supply and pricing relatively stable, processors have the
foundation in place for a successful 1996.

STABILITY SEEMS TO BE AT HAND IN GLOBAL COMMODITY-RESINS MARKETS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Processors of large-volume resins have experienced an unusual degree of
chaos in buying raw materials over the past year. But industry seers
predict that 1996 holds the potential for greater stability (and so
predictability) in the cost and availability of polyolefin, styrenic, and
vinyl resins.
   ``Expect a reasonable equilibrium between demand and supply in 1996,''
says Jim Fisher, president of consultant IBMA, Princeton, NJ. He and other
consultants generally expect the prices of most volume resins to stabilize
at or near fourth-quarter 1995 levels early in the new year. But some
suppliers expect that a ``bounce,'' or slight upswing in prices, might
occur. One possible harbinger of this: Dow Chemical, Midland, MI, saying PE
is undervalued, announced a 5 cents/lb. across-the-board increase for Jan.
1.
   What disturbs processors most about an uneven pricing course is the
uncertainty it entails in strategic planning. Volatility, no matter how
slight, thwarts efforts to schedule production, control inventory, or
follow a business plan. An underlying concern about pricing is global
demand. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are maintaining growth
rates, on average, at 50 to 100% higher than the typical increases in gross
domestic product for many countries, particularly developing nations.

Memories of recent cost carousel linger
   In 1994-95, volume-resin pricing took an erratic course worldwide
(graphs). Global interconnections in resin supply are apparent in parallel
pricing patterns for the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
   Overcapacity and low pricing levels for the various grades of PE, PP,
PS, and PVC had been widely projected for the period 1994-95. In fact,
mid-1994 prices stood close to historic lows. Crystal PS in the U.S. was at
45 cents/lb.; spot tags for PP homopolymer in Germany and PVC in Asia were
at $1000/metric ton.

Unforeseen scenarios thwart business plans
   But the unexpected intervened. A spate of natural and operational
difficulties struck resin and monomer plants worldwide at the turn of 1995,
pushing monomer costs up and disrupting resin supplies. A hoarding frenzy
and six-month-long inventory buildup followed. Moreover, resin exports to
China, a burgeoning market, kept soaring. At the May-June peak, PS had
risen by 26% in the U.S., PP by 35% in Germany, and PVC by 13% in Japan as
compared to mid-1994.
   Around mid-1995, a reversal was underway. IBMA's Fisher attributes this
to effects of the continuing recession in Japan, to slowdowns in France and
the U.K., China's sudden retreat from aggressive resin buying (which
depressed export prices), and a resultant inventory rundown. Major monomers
fell in cost, but less so than resin; supplier margins were squeezed.
   At presstime, all the large-volume resin prices had dropped from their
1995 peaks, typically by approximately 25% in the U.S. and about 40% in
Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, prices generally remain above the lows they
reached in 1994.
   Ron Yocum, CEO at Quantum Chemical Co., Cincinnati, OH, a major
polyolefins producer, says that the demand side for PE and PP remains
favorable. He pegs underlying PE growth at about 1.5 to 1.7 times that of
GDP. National economies obviously vary by region, but in the developed
countries, this could yield growth in the low single digits - generally on
the order of 3 to 5%/yr. In countries like China, where GDP is increasing
at double-digit rates, PE growth would be much greater.
   But why did official PE demand in one major market, the U.S., rise by
12% in 1994 and remain relatively flat in 1995? (Figures released at
presstime by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Washington, DC, show a
0.9% decline in production and a 3% drop in sales and captive use for PE in
the U.S.) Inventory shifts, brought about by turmoil in 1994-95, obscured a
real growth rate for 1995 of around 4 to 5%. Yocum sees continued growth
being aided by technology (e.g., super-condensing modes that double
LLD/HDPE capacity at 40 to 70% of cost), and improving polyolefins
cost-performance.
   In PP, suppliers expect underlying growth to be twice that of global GDP
through 2000.

Substantial growth seen in developing nations
   Long-term, demand prospects favor other resins, too. Developing
economies (e.g., China, India, parts of Latin America) represent a dramatic
source of growth for styrenics and PVC. For instance, PS use is booming in
Brazil. Alberto Carvalheiro, commercial director of EDN, the top PS
supplier there, puts domestic growth at 25% for 1994 (a boom period) and
10% for 1995. Underlying growth is 1.3 times GDP, and expanding PS use in
packaging and export products (appliances, toys, TV cabinets) is credited.
   A striking example of demand strength is Mexico. Despite the collapse of
the peso and a 10% decline in GDP, demand by packagers and export-oriented
processors for some resins in Mexico actually grew in 1995. Monica Conde,
an analyst with consultant IMPI, Mexico City, estimates that demand in
Mexico for polyethylene terephthalate, PP, and PS rose, respectively, by
38%, 8%, and 4% last year.
   By late 1995, some industry sources argue, the decline of prices for
large-volume resins had bottomed out in the U.S., with inventories becoming
more in balance. IBMA's Fisher, however, says softness in many European
economies makes it less likely that prices there will firm up as quickly.
He says that many countries in Europe have yet to fully address the high
social cost of their social welfare policies. The seers pepper their
forecasts with caveats, most notably discounting the impact of a possible
recession, or a new, unexpected round of plant shutdowns.
   Stable monomer costs are one reason cited for expecting more resin
stability in 1996. Fred Petersen of Probe Economics, Armonk, NY, who tracks
monomers, notes that ethylene, which gyrated from 16 to 28 cents/lb. in
1994-95, is now at 21 cents/lb. Currently announced ethylene expansions, if
carried out, should assure adequate ethylene supply for two years, Petersen
adds. Propylene and styrene are considered likely to tighten slowly, not
moving upward before 1997-98.

Planned capacity will meet demand
   As for resin capacity, experts foresee two major waves of expansion over
the next several years. In PE, for instance, North American-based suppliers
will add some 2.8 billion lb. (e.g., Novacor in Canada) in 1997-98, or
enough to almost balance new demand. A much larger spurt in capacity is set
to occur offshore, notably in the Far East. Most forecasts see world PE
capacity rising by 16% through 1998.
   Bill Kuhlke of consultant Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, puts today's
global PE operating rate at 86%. He sees growth absorbing added capacity by
1998. Utilization rates by then would rise to 91%, which would put new
pressure on pricing.
   Super-condensing-type modes for LLD/HDPE plants developed by BP
Chemicals, Exxon Chemical, and Union Carbide make a second PE expansion
feasible. But the impact won't be felt before 1999.
   In styrenics, consultants foresee crystal grades averaging 48 cents/lb.
in 1996, a figure that is close to current levels. Added capacity in the
styrene-importing regions (Western Europe and the Far East) is seen causing
a 50% drop in U.S. exports. Ed Glatzer of Chem Systems anticipates styrene
averaging 36 cents/lb. in 1996 and 33 cents/lb. in 1997, which would help
keep PS and ABS prices low.
   In vinyl, Richard Roman, Roman Assoc., Cleveland, OH, sees a
supply-demand balance lasting several years. New capacity will about match
anticipated growth. The U.S. and Eastern European producers, moreover, are
likely to be export bases for meeting the PVC needs of developing nations.

STRONG GROWTH WILL CARRY OVER INTO DIVERSE MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS

By:
Robert Colvin, with Stephen Moore in Tokyo

   Polypropylene is the only olefin resin in North America, Western Europe,
and Japan to have registered substantive growth last year. The material
showed most gains in blow molded containers (North America), sheet,
profile, and film extrusion, and injection molded packaging.
   These results stem from end-use growth and polypropylene's continuing
versatility as a resin, which is expanding its use in areas like
packaging.
   The results in North America, at least, also reflect a shift that took
place in inventory and production last year. In 1994, U.S. sales of most
commodity resins were at double-digit levels - at times beyond the
abilities of production capacity, according to Kevin Boyle of Occidental
Chemical Corp., Dallas, TX, chairman of the Society of the Plastics
Industry's Committee on Resin Statistics. This in turn led to a run on
purchasing, which shifted inventories of volume resins from producers to
converters. As buying slowed in 1995, inventories shifted back to
producers, with the result being that in the U.S., while production of all
plastics rose 3.4% in 1995 over 1994, total sales and captive use increased
by only 0.3%, according to figures released by the SPI at a press briefing
in its Washington, DC, headquarters on Dec. 6, 1995.

Resin's strength lifted U.S. production figures
   Though SPI began including Canadian sales with those of the U.S. in PP
last year, thus making year-to-year comparisons with 1994 difficult, Boyle
noted during the press briefing that had PP production been deleted from
1995 U.S. resin figures, thermoplastics production would have declined by
half, to 1.7% over 1994.
   In many global markets polypropylene producers are, however,
anticipating a first-quarter turnaround from fourth-quarter 1995. If this
happens, processors will find plenty of material - inventories at many
suppliers are reportedly hovering at around 6 to 7 weeks' supply. Prices,
moreover, should remain at or around current levels in most areas. No wild
fluctuations are predicted. Nor do many experts foresee PP supply
tightening before 1999.
   Consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc. Inc. (PTAI), Houston, TX, projects an
average annual growth in worldwide PP consumption of 7.2% between 1994 and
1999.
   Continuing advances in PP performance are strengthening its
price/properties ratio. A number of manufacturers have come up with ways to
improve properties and thus bridge the performance gap between the resin
and select engineering polymers. Examples include the Hivalloy
polymerization process from Montell, Wilmington, DE; injection molding
grades of impact copolymer from Fina Oil & Chemical Co., Dallas, and new
Controlled Crystallinity PP (CCPP) resins manufactured by Borealis, Lyngby,
Denmark.
   Some observers estimate that as much as two-thirds of PP's consumption
increase is at the expense of other thermoplastics. Robert Woods, business
manager for PP at Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, says that due to gains
in clarity, renewed interest has surfaced in PP as a substitute for PET in
some dairy and food containers such as peanut butter jars.
   Rexene Products Co., meanwhile, has a developmental PP-based flexible
polymer, Rexflex FPO, which the Dallas-based supplier claims will pull
automotive market share from PUR and foamed PVC, by virtue of its improved
melt strength and a 35% lower density than PVC.
   Joseph T. Bonk, specialty polymers manager, says automotive applications
are expected to include skin-covered foamed instrument panels whose
strength will be that they are made from a single resin - PP - thus 
facilitating recycling. Since the material contains no plasticizers, window
fogging is not a problem. To meet expected FPO demand, Rexene is building a
50-million-lb./yr. facility in Odessa, TX, that is to come on stream in the
third quarter.

Asia remains large growth market
   Outside North America, Western Europe, and Japan, the demand equation
for PP changes radically. Consultant Andrew Stevens at PTAI, for example,
sees average annual growth for Asia (excluding Japan) of 11.5% through
1999.
   Demand for PP in China remains high and is growing by as much as 11%
annually. Present local production stands at 2.64 billion lb./yr. compared
with demand of 4.4 billion lb./yr. By 2010, some 8.65 billion lb./yr. will
be needed. Because local producers won't be able to meet demand, observers
predict that imports will not only meet consumption needs in China, but
have a ripple effect on global supply. Assuming demand remains constant and
price is attractive, excess capacity could flow to China and create tight
supplies elsewhere.
   Tianjin United Chemical, Tianjin, China, has just started up an
882-million-lb./yr. PP plant based on Montell technology. Two other
882-million-lb./yr. plants have also come on stream: one in Guangdong,
financed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese investors, and one at the Zhongyuan
Petrochemical Union, which uses Montell technology.
   Other important PP markets include India with about 16% yearly growth
potential. India, despite a population of about 950 million, has one of the
lowest per-capita plastics consumption rates in the world, about 1 kg. (2.2
lb.) The average global consumption rate is around 16 kg. (35 lb.) The
U.S., by contrast, consumes about 60 kg. (132 lb.) of plastics/person. The
potential for PP (as well as other resins) is thus tremendous.
   Major players like Reliance Industries, Bombay, and Indian
Petrochemicals, Baroda, are expanding capacities. Domestic PP capacity
should rise to 1.19 billion lb./yr. by 1996 and to 2.64 billion lb./yr. by
2000. Reliance is setting up a 771-million-lb./yr. plant at Jamnagar in
addition to a 771-million-lb./yr. facility at Hazira. This capacity will
make it the sub-continent's largest PP producer.
   Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan's Ravi Chemicals Group, in a joint
venture with British-based Alyph Ltd., is to build a 154-million-lb./yr.
plant in Karachi - the country's first. Pakistan uses 110 million lb./yr.
The balance is for export.

Production expansions, consolidations proceed
   Capacity expansions and realignments are, of course, ongoing everywhere.
In Japan last year there was the merger of Tokyo-based Showa Denko and
Nippon Petrochemicals, which created a polyolefins giant offering 762
million lb./yr. of capacity. This was followed by further consolidation in
the Japanese market with a union between Mitsui Petrochemical Industries
and Ube Industries, in Tokyo, to offer 992 million lb./yr. of nameplate
capacity.

New capacity is coming on stream
   Europe has 14 PP suppliers. Among them is Dow Europe, Horgen,
Switzerland, which has plans to build a 440-million-lb./yr. plant at Buna
in the former East Germany.
   In Africa, meanwhile, Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, has increased
capacity from 132 million lb./yr. to 330 million lb. at its 50:50 joint
venture in Sasolburg, South Africa.
   In the U.S., Solvay Polymers, Houston, TX, is building a gas-phase
reactor and also debottlenecking lines to increase capacity from 440
million lb./yr. to 770 million lb. at Deer Park, TX, this year.
   Exxon Chemical Co., which is also based in Houston, has plans to build a
527-million-lb./yr. plant in Baytown, TX.

Many plants are built, few are being closed
   Will all this capacity be needed? Particularly in Europe where many
observers have complained for several years that there is already too much
capacity in place from too many producers?
   Observers point out that although a number of plants are going up, few
older ones are being decommissioned. Among the reasons that are cited for
this, according to Quantum's Woods, is that it may be easier to keep older
plants operating than to pay the cost of shuttering them and cleaning up
the property. Regulation not only influences plastics use, but affects the
economics of production as well.

VOLUME IS BEGINNING TO BUILD AS END-USERS ASSESS RESINS' BENEFITS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Metallocene-catalyzed polyolefins have generated much notice. But 1996
may be a watershed in determining their impact.
   Until now, metallocene polyethylene (mPE) and polypropylene (mPP) resins
have been circumscribed by narrow (though widening) grade slates,
confidential R&D, and patent disputes. Small, dedicated resin units
operate, but their capacity is less than 0.5% of market potential.
   Now, the catalysts are being retrofit to full-scale units for every
major polymerization process, which puts them into the production
mainstream. The trio of current mPE suppliers (Exxon, Dow, and Mitsui)
becomes a pack in 1996. Five suppliers are set to launch mPP grades.
Processors can also expect mPE and perhaps mPP technology to be licensed by
other producers before 1996 is over (table).
   The materials could help to sustain plastics growth rates at historic
levels (i.e., double the GDP). ``Metallocenes potentially allow polyolefins
to replace [some] higher-cost performance materials,'' states Ron Yocum,
CEO at Quantum Corp.
   There's little doubt among processors and suppliers that mPE and mPP can
offer cost-performance gains across a swath of specialty markets.
Metallocene PE is commercial, in the U.S., in niches like
controlled-permeation films (e.g., produce bags) and low-residuals wire and
cable, and, in Europe, flexible hosing.
   In dispute is how fast and how far grades can go in ``pseudo-commodity''
markets. Pseudo-commodity applications use volume resins like PE and PP,
but require property enhancements, like clarity and toughness, which
justify a premium and are attainable via metallocene catalysis.
   Examples are some clarity films (now served by LDPE), stretch film
(typically higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE), and flexibles (plasticized vinyl and
rubber).
   Consultants foresee 1996-98 as a time when mPE and mPP extend their
reach (most rapidly in the U.S.) to larger markets: e.g., stretch film
(superior toughness and cling), molded medical parts, and polymer
modifiers.

Battling constraints in metallocenes' use
   ``There's no doubt about mPE's specialties role; what's less clear is
end-user commitment in volume markets,'' says John Murphy of Catalyst
Consultants Inc., Spring Hills, PA. One reason for end-user ambiguity is
the desire to keep a low profile to retain a competitive advantage. More
substantive reasons for questioning the growth of metallocene materials use
have been resin capacity limits, cost, and processability.
   ``Capacity limits are no longer a realistic long-term constraint,''
declares Bob Bauman, of consultant Chem Systems, Tarrytown, NY. He says
that in the past year, a number of suppliers have run mPE in gas-phase,
slurry, loop, and high-pressure process units (table). Retrofits involve
upgrading a unit's catalyst delivery system and changing reactor
conditions, both done at modest cost.
   Exxon has run 30 million lb. of mPE on a 1-billion-lb./yr. gas-phase
plant in the U.S. Thus, it seems feasible to capitalize on mPE benefits
without building specialized or dedicated capacity - a view also taken by
BP, Union Carbide, and Mobil. In theory, at least, it is feasible to use a
new type of swing capacity - units that shift between metallocene and
conventional catalysts.
   Other sources point out the practical limits to retrofitting metallocene
catalysts to units. In fact (as with current LLDPE/HDPE swing units), this
capability is likely to be used rarely, since units are large and
inflexible. Except in large volumes, shifting between grades and catalysts
adds downtime, increases off-spec transition material, cuts throughput, and
raises cost.
   A common strategy is to convert small, often aging, reactors to mPE, an
approach taken by Union Carbide, Hoechst, BASF, and BP. David James,
Carbide's R&D director, suggests that dedicated plants best optimize
comonomer use at present (metallocenes being 10-fold more efficient than
regular catalysts).
   Dow favors dedicated capacity. It has announced a 300% increase in
worldwide mPE (tradename Insite) capacity for 1996. This includes a second
125-million-lb./yr. unit in the U.S., and a 150-million-lb. unit in Spain.
Len Azzaro, PE commercial director, says LLDPEs using Insite technology
will be made at a 400-million-lb./yr. unit by late 1996.

Cost is an issue: will premium stay or be cut?
   Metallocene PE catalyst costs 1 to 1.5 cents/lb. more than HAO-LLDPE
catalyst. This helps make mPE 10 to 15% costlier than LLDPE. And it creates
a dilemma: dedicated units cost more to run, volumes do not yet justify
dedicating full-scale units, and economies of scale are adverse. Balaji
Singh of consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc., Houston, TX, says suppliers
must pare mPE costs to gain share. He sees catalyst costs falling to under
1 to 1.5 cents/lb. in excess of LLDPE in five years.
   In theory, this should lower resin prices. But Bill Kuhlke of consultant
Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, expects suppliers (with an estimated $3.3
billion in metallocenes investment) to keep premiums up, perhaps for as
long as 15 years, to pay back costs of development and in capacity. Others
say the market will determine price, payback notwithstanding.
   Exxon and BP plan to run mPE on large-scale gas reactors. This could
entail high operating costs, but they see it as the best way to seed
markets as demand grows. Eventually, mPE volumes would rise, and a
full-scale plant could be dedicated. Estimates of when this crossover might
occur range from five to 10 years.
   Suppliers cite gains in making mPE more processable. Singh notes that a
shift to metallocenes in markets like stretch film and medical moldings can
be a ``minor headache'' for processors versus shifting from LDPE to LLDPE.
   Horst Maack, president of consultant Maack Business Services, Au,
Switzerland, questions whether mPE can be run in Europe's (mostly LDPE)
process equipment by just tweaking machinery. Maack says mPE involves
higher conversion costs for those adopting mPE in film in Europe. Changes
in screws, die gaps, feed sections, and winding equipment add 5% to 30% to
investment. And mPE also runs hotter than conventional PE, so throughputs
could fall and costly controls may be needed.
   ``A landslide in volume markets in Europe is likely when mPE matches
LDPE's processability,'' says Maack. He sees 200,000 tons (400 million lb.)
of mPE use in Europe by 2000.
   Hartz Mann, BASF's PE applications director, sees blending as one way to
introduce mPE in Europe. BASF's tubular LDPE capacity is said to be optimal
for plastomer versions (grades of 0.886 to 0.910 g./cc. density). Slurry
process units may prove most suitable for high-density mPEs.
   Penetration by mPE and mPP technologies also depends on licensing.
Exxon, with a broad stake in patents, and alliances with Hoechst
(catalyst), Mitsui (gas-phase process), and DSM (plastomers), may have an
edge. But licensing also requires a servicing and know-how infrastructure,
which may give Union Carbide and BP an inside track.
   Roland Hingmann, BASF's R&D director for polypropylene, says that
running mPP in PP plants is feasible, if not as simple as for mPE. The
ability has, in fact, been demonstrated by Hoechst, Exxon, BASF, and others
in gas and slurry reactors. BASF is promoting with its technology improved
homopolymer, controlled-rheology grades, high-stiffness and -toughness
copolymers, and reactor TPOs.


These are the top contenders in the drive to commercialize technology for
production of metallocene-based polymers*

DEMAND MATCHES GDP GROWTH IN DEVELOPED NATIONS, SURGES IN ASIA

By:
Joseph A. Grande


   Last year ABS demand stabilized in many areas and approached more
traditional growth rates.
   Use of ABS showed a decline of about 8% in the U.S., the first drop in
four years, while Europe managed a slight gain. Consumption was strong in
Japan, which posted an 8% gain, the first significant increase in five
years. Meanwhile, the rest of the Far East had double-digit growth. The
overall performance was a distinct contrast to 1994, which saw
above-average consumption.
   ``Performance in 1994 was not real growth because we were coming out of
deep recession,'' says Harald Laesche, ABS product manager at Bayer AG,
Leverkusen, Germany. As a result, observers say 1995's weaker numbers
should be viewed within the market's overall performance of the last five
years. During that period, ABS has grown about 3% annually, in line with
GDP growth of developed countries, says Ulf Buergel, business manager of
styrene copolymers for Dow Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.

Bayer acquisition changes global scene
   The lineup of global players changed last year, as Bayer revealed plans
to purchase Monsanto's ABS business. The move will more than double Bayer's
capacity and propel it into the top tier of ABS producers, alongside Chi
Mei and GE Plastics.
   A global study of the styrenics business by consultant Chem Systems,
Tarrytown, NY, predicts 5 to 6% annual growth through 2000. Mature U.S. and
European markets will see marginal gains.
   Demand in Japan will grow at an average of 1.6% over the next three
years, led by toys, leisure goods, and construction, according to the Japan
ABS Resin Industry Assn., Tokyo. Use in vehicles will decrease due to lower
production volumes and increased substitution of PP. Meanwhile, exports are
forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 9.2%. Hot destinations are
China, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
   The rest of the Far East will enjoy double-digit growth, says Edward
Glatzer of Chem Systems.
   In inter-polymer substitution, competition with PS and PP is at
equilibrium, suppliers claim. High-impact PS and PP continue to nip at ABS,
however, particularly in appliances that were over-engineered in ABS. In
European autos, governmental requirements for impact at low temperature may
bring back interiors that had been switched to PP.
   One bright spot last year was continued demand for ABS and ABS/PC blends
in computers and telecommunications. Growth is spurred by miniaturization
and the ability of materials to provide thin walls, strength, and high
processability. These blends are growing at a 15 to 20% rate in
applications such as cellular phones and notebook computers. On the other
hand, ABS has seen significant erosion in computer monitors and keyboards.
PS has gained a strong foothold based on cost and lower physical
requirements.
   A key target for GE Plastics is building and construction. The firm is
pushing Cycolac ABS, coextruded with a capstock of
acrylic/styrene/acrylonitrile, for window profiles, cladding, and other
components.
   Most of the world's capacity buildup is in Asia. Chi Mei, Tainan,
Taiwan, has plans to construct a 441-million to 882-million-lb./yr. plant
in Singapore or Malaysia. The company also plans to boost capacity in
Taiwan to 2.6 billion lb./yr. by 1998.
   Toray Industries, Tokyo, will double capacity in Malaysia to 353 million
lb./yr. by summer, making it the largest ABS facility in Southeast Asia.
   Improved processability remains crucial. At Dow, new Magnum ABS grades
provide lower plateout and double the melt flow rate.

SPECIALTY GRADES PROMISE GROWTH DESPITE SHORTAGES OF GLASS FIBERS

By:
Peter Mapleston


   Supply problems for nylon compounds have much to do with the
availability of glass-fiber reinforcements. A shortage in fibers occurred
after a fast pick-up in demand that started in 1994 and carried through
first-half 1995.
   Glass-fiber prices also moved up over 15% in 1995, though they are still
at sub-1980's levels. This year could see them rise again, from 5% into
double digits, depending on market conditions, which are softening in
areas.
   Another issue is the decision by Owens Corning to phase out 10-micron
fibers favored by many compounders (mostly European) and focus on 11- and
14-micron fibers that are less costly to produce. That's reflected in the
price: OCF 14-micron fibers sell for around 15% less than 10-micron
grades.
   At Hoechst-Celanese in Dallas, TX, nylon 66 product manager Chuck
Calhoun says the company has ``outstanding'' glass fiber-reinforced
products that rely on very fine fibers for much of their performance -
performance that could be hard to reproduce with thicker types.
   Jim Morelli, sales and marketing director at AlliedSignal, Morristown,
NJ, is sanguine. Allied's Capron nylon 6 grades ``are very forgiving. We
can use a significant number of types of fibers.''
   Resin-wise, if demand stays around 7%/yr., there should be no problems
in nylon 66 supply. Nylon 6 supply is less critical, due largely to a
slackening in the fibers market that enables polymer makers to divert
material to compounds. In Europe especially, millions of pounds of polymer
from ex-East Bloc countries are available. Nylon 66 prices are thus firm,
while nylon 6 price is under downward pressure.
   While the auto market in North America is flat overall, growth in nylons
will come through increased penetration into manifolds. Japanese car makers
are also switching to nylon manifolds.
   Prospects, in fact, look good for nylon 6 in air-intake manifolds.
Glass-reinforced compounds perform as well or better than 66 in parts
assembled by vibration welding, which is replacing lost-core injection
molding for manifolds fitted to some European cars. Allied says Capron HPN
(high-productivity nylon) 6 grades, initially for packaging, may be
preferable to 66 in lost-core molding, since their high flow improves cycle
times and reduces core shift. The company claims the grades allow
productivity gains of 20 to 30% over standard nylon 6.
   Bayer has programs with auto-makers for making large parts using hybrid
technology in which plastics, often nylons, are molded around large metal
inserts. Parts include cross-car beams, door panels, and seat frames.
   At Hoechst-Celanese, Calhoun cites good growth in niche automotive
electronics, as well as in components for suspension systems called
spring-seat spacers. The components, each around 4 oz., replace fabricated
metal, saving weight and cost.
   Several companies are introducing nylons with improved high-temperature
properties (Dec MP, 74). DuPont has added Zytel HTN semi-aromatic grades in
Europe. Main target is automotive - fog-lamp housings, ignition parts,
sensors, components for ABS brakes - but several electronics applications
are turning up for dimensional stability and heat resistance. Grades have a
glass-transition temperature 135 degrees F. higher than nylon 66;
properties are marginally affected by water uptake. Creep is low.
   Most activity for nylons in packaging is in films with improved barrier.
EMS-Chemie, Domat/Ems, Switzerland, has introduced what it terms
``multi-polyamides'' that contain over three types of nylon, and in some
cases as many as five. The copolymers are for niches such as cheese
packaging, to prevent the ballooning that occurs when cheese gases can't
escape through skin packaging.
   The materials replace PVdC in multilayer structures. According to EMS,
they are as good as PVdC at keeping oxygen out of the pack, and better at
letting carbon dioxide out. The materials are also said to be easier to
process than PVdC. Their low melt point and crystallinity suit them for
biaxial orientation.

SURGING DEMAND IN HIGH-GROWTH REGIONS BUOYS END-USE OUTLOOK

By:
Martin O'Neill


   Polyvinyl chloride sales were generally even in North America and
Western Europe last year, and off substantially (approximately 9.5%) in
Japan. Reasons for the material's performance in these regions, apart from
the continuing recession in Japan, include a second-half decline in
economically sensitive end-use markets like housing starts and general
construction, conversion to competitive materials like PET and PP in
packaging, and, to a degree, issues of recyclability.
   Exports, however, were up in many areas, notably from the U.S. (about
1.4 billion lb. - a 20% jump from 1994); also, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and
Eastern Europe. Factors influencing this range from the weakness of the
U.S. dollar to European currencies like the German mark (though the price
differential is not as pronounced as it was in 1994), to overcapacity in
Japan chasing developing market opportunities in Asia.
   The outlook for PVC use this year varies by region. Since PVC demand
tends to follow GDP growth in the developed nations, average growth is
forecast for North America and Western Europe. Some economists predict
economic growth in the 2 to 2.6% range for the Group of Seven nations - the
U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan - primarily
as a result of efforts to reduce budget deficits. Others predict that some
national economies will experience less growth - as little as 1.3% in the
U.S., for example. The winner would appear to be Japan, for which growth of
2.1% is forecast by some experts for 1996 - low compared to many countries,
but a substantial jump from the 0.1% growth predictions for 1995 that were
made late last year.
   In other areas, PVC could see sizeable growth. Infrastructure repair,
for example, will continue in Eastern Europe, creating demand for window
profiles. The growing economies of some Latin American countries and the
continuing strength of Asia bode well for PVC use in these areas.
   And while PET continues to take share away from PVC in packaging, some
applications are holding firm while others are reverting to the material.
In France, Evian has switched from PVC to PET bottles for its mineral
water, and Vittel will follow suit this year. Yet due to its price, PVC
continues to play a major role in bottled water. In film, one European
grocery chain is changing back to PVC from polyethylene for meat wrap, to
get a shelf life of 2 to 4 days versus 24 hr. with PE.
   The bright spot in the PVC market, as with other resins, is Asia, where
capacity and demand are increasing, albeit from a relatively low starting
point. Joint ventures among Japanese, South Korean, and Western companies
are prominent, but domestic development is also strong.
   Thailand was a net exporter of PVC for the first time in 1994. It has
embarked on an ambitious expansion program that could see it become the
world's largest supplier in the next decade.
   India's PVC market is expected to grow from 1.03 billion lb. to 1.76
billion lb. by 2000, according to industry estimates.
   Demand for PVC in Vietnam is 110 million lb./yr., but growing by 20%
annually. Occidental Chemical Corp, Dallas, TX, and trading house Marubeni
Corp., Osaka, Japan, are establishing a 220-million-lb./yr. suspension
plant in southern Vietnam, which is due on stream by 1998. The venture,
Oxy-Vina Plastics and Chemical Co., is the first involving a U.S.
corporation in that country since resumption of diplomatic relations
between America and Vietnam last year.
   In China, PVC capacity is about 3.3 billion lb./yr. Imports amounted to
1.07 billion lb. in 1994, including copolymers. The country plans to
complete three plants before 1998, increasing capacity by 352 million
lb./yr., according to the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

REGIONAL GROWTH, OVERCAPACITY MAY CHANGE PATTERNS OF SUPPLY

By:
Martin O'Neill


   The phenomenal growth of PET in packaging over the last 20 years may be
slowing in mature markets, like North America, but its potential in largely
untapped markets assures solid growth for the foreseeable future.
   G. Keith Mitchell, director of consultant PCI Ltd., in London, noted the
potential for PET in several regions at a conference late last year
sponsored by The Packaging Group Inc., Milltown, NJ. Per-capita consumption
in North America and Europe is, respectively, 3362 and 1150 g. But it's
only 520 g./person in South America, 270 g. in the Middle East and Africa,
and 220 g./person in Asia-Pacific.
   Overall, observers say the outlook for 1996 is ``snug,'' with Europe
projected to import up to 363 million lb. of resin this year, a 7.8%
increase over 1995. The North American supply-demand ratio should be
relatively balanced in 1996, with quantities available for export to Europe
and South America. Much surplus capacity exists in Asia and Asia-Pacific,
where output is 20% for domestic use and 80% for export.
   Meanwhile, the capacity buildup continues worldwide, and will have an
impact as soon as next year. In 1997, Europe's PET imports are projected by
Mitchell to decline to 15 million lb. In 1998, he forecasts that Europe
will be a net exporter, capable of shipping 321 million lb.
   By 1997-98, if all the capacity that's under construction or planned
comes on line, says Guido Ghisolfi, CEO of Sinco Engineering, an Italian
builder of PET plants, there could be global overcapacity of 6.6 billion
lb.
   Among changes that experts like Ghisolfi see from this is a demand by
the major end-users of PET to stabilize the resin's price structure
worldwide. Ghisolfi says that about 10 multinationals (e.g., Nestle,
Unilever, Coca-Cola) consume 60% of PET. If such overcapacity occurs, it
would be a buyer's market, and the volumes these end-users consume will
give them much leverage in pressing for price stability - even to insisting
that prices not be tied entirely to raw materials' costs.
   Such observations are speculative. Yet expansions continue.
   Eastman Chemical is building in Spain and Latin America, and targets 3.4
billion lb. in place globally in late 1998.
   Hoechst will triple capacity to over 3 billion lb. by 2000, and may
build in Asia.
   Shell Chemicals will bring North American capacity to 1.1 billion
lb./yr. In Italy, capacity will be doubled to 352 million lb./yr. by early
1997, in Patrica.
   ICI has a U.S. plant in precommission, which will boost North American
capacity to 363 million lb./yr. A 264-million-lb./yr. European plant will
come on stream this year, raising the regional total to 484 million
lb./yr.
   Meanwhile, Dow Europe has entered the PET business via an agreement with
Enichem, whereby Dow acquires 80% of its Inca Intl. subsidiary in Italy.
   In Japan, Kaneko is adding a 33-million-lb./yr. unit in Sabae to
complement its 55-million-lb./yr. plant in Hofu.
   Mitsui Petrochemical has absorbed Mitsui PET Resin Co., its bottle-grade
marketing arm, to combine its PET and purified terephthalic acid
activities.
   And China's Shantou Oceanic Group recently obtained approval to build
PET film and bottle-grade resin plants. Japanese sources believe China's
total PET resin capacity will grow from 3.8 billion lb./yr. in 1994 to 5.3
billion lb./yr. in 1997. Nonetheless, the country is expected to remain a
net importer of the resin through the 1990s.

RESIN SHORTAGE SHOULD EASE THIS YEAR AS CAPACITY COMES ON STREAM

By:
Peter Mapleston


   The market for PC has been tight, due to high demand (10 to 12% growth
in late 1995) and supply problems experienced by several producers last
year.
   But relief is coming. This year there will be 135 million lb./yr. more
in GE's Burkville, AL, plant, and a further expansion of undisclosed size
at Bergen op Zoom, in The Netherlands. Bayer is debottlenecking three
plants, in Belgium, Germany, and the U.S.; and it is considering adding a
third line in Antwerp, Belgium. Dow is also debottlenecking. Bayer,
meanwhile, awaits approval - possibly in the first quarter - for a
25-million-lb./yr. plant in China.
   The net result of these expansions, says Bayer vp. Mark Witman, is that
supply will be back in balance in 1997.
   ``Demand will be strong in 1996, but not as strong as in 1995,'' says
Dow Chemical's PC business director Mike Murry, in Midland, MI. GE's Lexan
manager in Europe, Robert Williams, expects a slowdown in growth to as
little as 5%/yr.
   Meanwhile, prices rose over 10% last year, with the highest jump in the
Far East, where they are near twice those of mid-1994, compared to some 40%
higher in Europe. Suppliers expect prices to stick in 1996.
   Growth in the Far East remains strong. Production of PC in Japan was
likely to exceed 450 million lb. last year. Demand is fueled by electronics
and exports. With Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea active importers
of Japanese PC, exports are again expected to account for over half of
Japanese shipments. Coupled with increases in domestic use, Japanese
shipments may rise 10% in 1995, versus 35% in 1994.
   Korean demand for PC is seen surpassing 50 million lb. in 1995, owing to
growth in electronics and automotive. The market is expected to continue
its dependence on imports until the only polymer maker, Samyung Kasei,
completes an expansion to 66 million lb./yr. at the end of 1997.
   Demand for PC in China, mainly from processors in Guangdong, will likely
double by 2000. China imports almost all its PC. Local producers have
capacity of 5.5 million lb./yr., but production problems have seen output
dwindle to under 2.2 million lb./yr.
   Production of CDs for music, computer data, and (soon) movies will
provide double-digit growth through the decade, with some putting the
figure at around 25%/yr. Bayer, GE, and Japan's Teijin are leaders in this
sector; Dow has a grade in development.
   Bayer is working on film insert molding for automotive and other
applications. First commercial use of the technology has been small parts
on which the film provides functional markings on switches and dials. Films
will be used for esthetics on larger parts. Films coming out of Bayer's
plant in Berlin, CT, coextrusions of PC and thermoplastic polyurethane,
have a soft touch.
   Prospects for PC blends in bumpers don't look good. GE, however, is
getting Xenoy used in body panels (mostly fenders) on limited-edition cars
as well as trucks. And it will supply material for the plastics-bodied
Smart car to be built by the Mercedes-Swatch venture in 1997 or 1998.
   Packaging activity revolves around multitrip containers for milk and
water. Dairies in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland have switched to PC
bottles, which can make 50 trips or more. Consumers like them because they
open more easily than cartons and are lighter than glass. Retailers like
them because, being square, they fit better onto pallets and require 30%
less space.
   Three- and 5-gal. containers for mineral water are finding more use.
Bayer cites double-digit growth in Europe, the Far East, and South America,
and says the potential market is 10 times higher than today.

WELCOME TO A `WORLDWIDE WEB'

By:
Patrick A. Toensmeier

   In 1996, MODERN PLASTICS will offer its own version of a ``worldwide
web.'' The ``web sites'' will be international plastics shows. Our ``web
servers'' will be tabloids developed for each show and distributed
on-site.
   There will be at least seven shows so covered. They are, as highlighted
on the map: Aseanplast, in Jakarta (Mar. 12-15); Argenplas, in Buenos Aires
(Apr. 18-24); Plastexpo, Lyon, France (May 21-24); Mercoplast, Rio de
Janeiro (Aug. 20-21); International Plastics Fair, Tokyo (Oct. 11-15);
Ausplas, Melbourne, Australia (Oct. 22-26); and Interplas, Birmingham,
England (Nov. 10-14). We may also produce a tabloid for Chinaplas, in
Beijing (Mar. 26-30), and for Equiplast, in Barcelona, Spain (Oct. 20-25).
   The tabloids will feature information about new products on display at
each show. They will also include overviews of local markets, business
trends, and other issues of interest to processors.
   Importantly, the news that MODERN PLASTICS acquires in developing these
tabloids, and in covering the shows, will be reported in the magazine as
well. And the contacts that our editors make in this process will help us
to provide, on a continuing basis, the information and perspective on
process technology, market issues, and business trends our readers need for
their decision-making.
   We will, of course, have a presence at more expositions this year.
MODERN PLASTICS' global editorial staff will cover over 20 shows around the
world in 1996. Show coverage may seem routine. But it's an opportunity for
readers to review the latest developments in materials and machinery that
can contribute to the capability and profitability of their operations.
   In today's global economy, trade shows are not local events. The
products and technologies they feature have an impact on companies
worldwide. Show coverage is part of the continuing effort by MODERN
PLASTICS to keep readers in step with developments that affect their
businesses, no matter where they do business.

MODULAR INJECTION MACHINES SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS

By:
EDITED BY MERLE R. SNYDER

   The Allrounder S models have further extended the degree of modularity
in Arburg's injection molding machines to incorporate units for all levels
of sophistication. The company has introduced two models, with platen
tiebar distances of 220 by 220 mm. and 270 by 270 mm. Both accept clamp
units with clamp forces of either 17 or 28 ton, and injection units with
Euromap designations 60 and 150.
   These are all standard equipment. The 60 injection unit takes cylinder
modules with diameters of 18, 22, and 25 mm., while the 150 version takes
25-, 30-, and 35-mm barrels. The standard control is the Selogica, with a
32-bit multiprocessor and a monochrome flat screen.
   The 220S model with 17-ton clamp replaces Arburg's 170CMD, which will
cease production in the second quarter (Arburg gave up production of larger
CMD models two years ago). These two new machines go into series production
in February, and are part of what will eventually be a complete line.
   Arburg says special attention was paid to floor-space requirements,
noise emissions (maximum noise level is 72 dB) and ergonomic design. For
example, mold-temperature control units can be fixed onto the frame of the
machine and plugged into cooling water distribution channels integrated
into the machine base. Other peripherals can also be positioned in the
immediate vicinity of the machine. With high-end Selogica controls,
multi-axis robots can be programmed directly from the machine control
panel.
   Electrical interfaces are integrated into the base, at front and rear.
The water-cooled electrical cabinet on the front of the machine is divided
in two, with 23-v. electronics on one side and 230-v. electronics on the
other.
   There are four pump combinations on the hydraulics. The basic machine
has a servo valve for movements and pressure hold, a main pump, and a
manual cooling water distributor. Users can opt for extended hydraulics to
enable injection and clamp movements to run parallel, motor capacity can be
increased, and there are levels of regulation for the injection unit and
for cooling water distribution.
   The clamp unit employs a double-piston system that is highly compact and
also provides good force distribution. The hydraulic valves are attached
directly to the rear face or (for core pullers) on top of the third platen,
and oil is pumped straight to the pistons, without need for hose
attachments.
   The central hydraulics unit at the rear of the machine is
self-contained, and is easily fixed to the machine base. Replacement where
possible of hoses by fixed metal pipes makes assembly easier and also
increases precision in use, since the pipes have fixed volumes. Arburg

TWO-MATERIAL MACHINE

   TWO-MATERIAL MACHINE. The VL2000 coinjection molding machine is the
largest of its kind ever shipped by Milacron. Two injection units feed into
a manifold that directs and meters the two different melts. Injection
capacity of each unit is 232 oz. Either or both of the injection units can
be backed out of the manifold for independent purging. The manifold can
also be independently purged. Both the units and the entire molding process
are integrally controlled by the Milacron Camac 486 Plus control system. In
operation, a pin in the manifold moves to open path A, path B, or both
paths together. The control system integrates simultaneous operation of the
two injection units. In most cases conventional molds can be used with no
modification. The operation is essentially an encapsulation process.
Separate core and skin layers can be molded. The skin layer of virgin,
transparent, or other resin types is injected first. Next, the core resin
follows the skin resin, pushing the skin out in front of it. The core resin
can consist of regrind, post-consumer reclaim, or a structural material. A
small finishing amount of skin resin is injected after the core to seal the
gate and complete the encapsulation. Cincinnati Milacron, 4165 Halfacre
Road, Batavia, OH 45103

VERSATILE STAMPING SYSTEMS ENHANCE USER CAPABILITIES

By:
Martin O'Neill, with Jennifer Gordon


   The growing sophistication of control systems on hot-stamping machines
improves the accuracy and versatility of the process. The use of
micro-processor-based systems assures reliable digital control of key
functions. This allows for more consistent decorating, improved
trouble-shooting, and less downtime. Touch-button access on many units also
displays messages of machine functions.
   20 Examples include equipment from Acromark, Berkeley Heights, NJ, that
focuses on exterior marking of cylindrical and tapered parts, and features
improved marking speed, repeatability and safety. Its line of direct-acting
presses ranges from 1/2 to 20-ton force, with die areas from 4 in. by 5 in.
to 24 in. by 36 in. Model 730RR variants include automatic loading and
unloading, plus double-sided versions with double silicone rollers to
increase output speed to close to 60 parts/min. Applications include foil
or preprinted heat transfer decoration of cosmetics containers, canisters,
and bracelets.
   Cassco Machines, Don Mills, ON, Canada, offers a system controller as
standard, allowing operation with turntables, slide tables, peripheral
roll-on attachments, foil strip delays, and pick-and-place units. Control
extends to a dual-speed heat-transfer indexing system for multi-color image
application in a single operation. High-speed, automated systems range in
use from a 1/4-ton hand-fed application to an 18-ton automated factory
press.
   Kensol/Franklin Hot Stamping Machines, Norwood, MA, assembles
hot-stamping machines and makes foils, dies, and tooling at three U.S.
facilities. The KF Model 500 1/2-ton air-operated press features a
user-friendly microprocessor control system, micrometer depth-stop control,
and dual-hardened steel head guides, in ball bearings, suitable for
silicone rubber dies and rugged enough to stamp with metal engraved dies.
   Meanwhile, Air Hydraulics Decorating Systems, St. Louis, MO, offers a
standard line of heat-transfer and foil machinery including horizontal and
vertical roll-ons. The horizontal Accu-Roll is used to apply large heat
transfers while eliminating air entrapment and foil wrinkling. Standard
features include a non-contact infrared temperature sensor, overheating
protection circuit, and variable carriage speed up to 4 in./sec. A coaxial
air/hydraulic cylinder carriage drive with left to right stroke motion
supplies stroke lengths ranging from 15 to 27 in.
   Baier, Rudersberg, Germany, makes both direct-imprint hot stamping
equipment and label-stamping with die-cutting machines for label
production. The company's Geba 1/PPP is adapted to the plastics-processing
industry, with three heads mounted at different angles to stamp various
parts in one operation.
   Cosmetics containers and closures demand refined, fashionable colors,
and eye-catching matte or high-gloss effects to produce an elegant image
and add value to products. Baier developed its new Geba 60 model for
hot-stamping round, oval, and conical shapes. Advantages include fast
tooling changeover for dies and holders, and economic small-run
capabilities. For larger quantities, the machine can be equipped with a
magazine feed system. Capabilities include line or motif stamping, or both
combined.

Equipment is specialized to meet diverse needs
   Because of its cost advantage and durability, hot-stamping is
increasingly used for storage boxes. Hydraulic and hydro-pneumatic machines
are most suited to this application. Baier's model Geba 4/HY has a stamping
pressure of 15 tons. The movement of the plunger is dependent not on
distance, but on pressure, allowing differences in material thickness to be
overcome. Throat and insertion height allow the processing of voluminous
parts.
   Kurz, Furth, Germany, has an in-mold decoration (IMD) technique,
combining injection and hot-stamping of multi-dimensional, flat, or curved
thermoplastics parts for automotive components, cosmetics containers,
electronic equipment casings, domestic appliances, watch faces, picture
frames, door blinds, and nameplates. Foils are fed through a custom-built
injection molding tool.
   During resin injection, pressure and heat from the material cause
release of lacquer layers from the polyester carrier, which bond to the
part providing good chemical and scratch resistance. The thickness of the
polyester carrier depends on decoration depth, part size, injection
position point, and the material being processed. The spent polyester is
wound off. Kurz claims this technique reduces costs by 10 to 50%.
   20 Maple Roll Leaf Co. Ltd., Windsor, ON, Canada, manufactures
pigmented stampings for use in automotive, appliance, cosmetic, or
pharmaceutical industries. The company says bright colors can be applied to
dark substrates.
   Stamp-Rite, Lansing, MI, manufactures steel hot-stamping dies for long
runs. Dies can be surface ground several times with no measurable change in
the stroke of characters. The manufacturing process forms raised characters
on the die while it is in the hardened condition, reducing distortion or
shrinkage possibilities.
   Transfer Print Foils, Inc., East Brunswick, NJ, claims to provide a wide
selection of hot-stamping foils and laminates for decorating plastics.
Customization of printed foils is available for such items as home
furnishings, profiles, and appliances. Decorated laminates in roll or sheet
stock are 2-ply and 3-ply, from 0.020 gage to 0.187 gage. The company says
laminates are available on ABS, PVC, PC, styrene and acrylic.
   United Silicone, Lancaster, NY, provides hot-stamping systems, tooling,
and services. The 2-1/2-ton Model US 25 applies foil or heat transfers to
flat or slightly flat crowned surfaces, and up to 90 deg. of a cylindrical
part's circumference. The US 25's foil-advance system is
electric-motor-driven and produces constant pulling torque for smooth
advance. The system features a foil-tensioning arm, which automatically
removes slack from the foil to eliminate wrinkling. Adjustable foil guide
bars and guide rings provide flexibility and ease of adjustment without any
tools.

HYDROGEN FLUORIDE IS CUT FROM COMPOUNDING PROCESS
ACID SCAVENGER ADDITIVES NUKE (NEUTRALIZE) NOXIOUS FUMES

By:
GAIL S. NONNEMACHER AND DR. STEPHEN I. FOSTER
Edited by William A. Kaplan

   Hydrogen fluoride earns the highest hazard rating given by the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration for dangerous materials in
the workplace. Even in low concentrations its effects can still cause
significant health problems. We have found that HF can be released from
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micropowders during compounding, and reach
impermissible levels capable of causing physical injury to workers. The use
of acid scavengers has been found to be highly effective in eliminating the
presence of this hazardous substance.
20 While studying the compounding of micronized PTFE (also termed
micropowders) in general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS), we encountered an
acrid odor. Although ventilation was used to mitigate the odor, it
persisted, especially in the vapor space of confined packages of the
micropowder and the concentrate. Our micropowder supplier thought the odor
originated from residual mineral oil used as a lubricant in its processing
operation and could be controlled by ventilation. This explanation did not
satisfy us and we discovered, surprisingly, the odor was HF. Although HF
can be liberated when PTFE decomposes at approximately 600 degrees F., this
is well above the processing temperature used in our study.
20 During the next compounding run, measurements at the vent port and die
face of the extruder as well as in the vapor space of the gaylords showed
HF concentrations well above 20 p.p.m. HF was also detected in the extruder
hoppers, which fed the concentrate for subsequent processing. The
concentration of HF in air was measured using a Sensidyne Model 800 pump
with hydrogen fluoride detector tubes. The estimates of HF concentration
depend on the degree of color change in the detector tube and the amount of
air drawn through the tube, and can be used to measure HF from 0.25 to 50
p.p.m. However, no HF could be detected outside the gaylords or the plastic
liner, or at a distance of greater than 4 ft. from the compounding
extruder.
   Micronized PTFE is normally prepared from virgin or scrap PTFE resin of
either the fine powder or granular variety. In producing micronized powder,
the PTFE is first coarsely ground and is then subjected to either electron
or gamma irradiation to reduce the molecular weight of the polymer. In
lowering the molecular weight, the PTFE becomes more crystalline; hence,
friable and grindable. The particle size can then be further reduced to
approximately 1 micron by air-impact grinding.

MW reduction process is a factor
   This processing sequence was followed by our micropowder supplier. From
discussions with PTFE industry experts, we learned that during the
irradiation process, the molecular weight of the PTFE is significantly
reduced from the 2- to 5-million range to approximately 200,000. This is
accomplished by breaking the carbon-carbon bond along the PTFE chains, a
process which creates many free radical species where the chains are
terminated. These reactive free radicals can combine with oxygen and/or
water from the air to form stable organic acids and acid fluorides. The
acid fluorides can further react with water to form organic acids,
liberating HF gas. Higher temperatures accelerate the liberation of HF.
Thus, when the micropowder is compounded, HF is liberated and slowly
diffuses out of the concentrate.
20 For example, one sample of the concentrate made during our study that
contained 20% PTFE was analyzed to determine the amount of hydrolyzible
fluoride, i.e., potentially releasable HF. The results indicate that the
pellets contained 5 p.p.m. hydrolyzible fluoride, which was assumed to be
available as HF. Assuming that a gaylord contains 1000 lb. of 20%
concentrate and that HF is an ideal gas, we calculated that, if all the HF
were instantaneously released, about 3000 p.p.m. could be found in the
vapor space of the gaylord. This calculation indicated that while the
amount of releasable HF in the pellet was small, there is enough
hydrolyzible fluoride in the concentrate to account for the HF measured in
the vapor space of the gaylords. The difference between the calculated and
actual amounts of HF in a gaylord is probably due to diffusion-limited
release of HF from the pellets.
20 We conjectured that HF generation during compounding was aggravated
due to the high melt temperatures that were employed, which ranged from 500
to 550 degrees F. Reduction of heating setpoints and throughput yielded a
lower melt temperature of 490 degrees F., but did not significantly impact
the generation of HF. We also hypothesized that pre-baking the PTFE
micropowder prior to compounding might reduce or remove much of the HF.
Several types of baked and unbaked, high and low irradiation PTFE were
obtained from our micropowder supplier and were compounded using our normal
extrusion temperatures, i.e., 500 to 550 degrees F. However, the level of
HF generated from the baked and unbaked samples was far in excess of
industrial hygiene limits.

Potential scavengers selected
   Based on the chemistry involved and our calculations indicating that the
concentration of HF in the pellets was exceedingly small, the use of an
acid scavenger represented a realistic approach to solving this problem.
Similarly, the suspected role of free radical chemistry in the production
of HF suggested that antioxidants, which scavenge free radicals, might also
be useful in solving this problem.
20 Acid scavenger candidates were: calcium stearate powders, DHT-4A (Mg
subscript 4.5 Al sbuscript 2 (OH) subscript 13 CO subscript3 .3 .5 H
subscript 2 O), and magnesium oxide powder. The calcium stearate and
magnesium oxide were pre-compounded into GPPS resin. Irganox B225 (from
Ciba-Geigy), an anti-oxidant, was also investigated, since it might react
with the PTFE chain ends to form a stable, non-reactive chain.
20 Blends of the 20% PTFE/80% GPPS concentrate and the potential
scavengers were re-compounded using typical operating conditions. (Table 1)
Potential scavengers were initially evaluated at loadings of 1% to provide
excess scavenger based on the measured level of hydrolyzible fluoride and
the reaction stoichiometry. The residual HF level was measured by
collecting a 7- to 10-lb. sample of the concentrate in a 60-liter PE bag,
sealing the bag for five minutes, and then measuring the HF evolved in the
air space. Upon discovery of a scavenger that resulted in a non-detectable
level of HF, the level of scavenger was halved and the experiment was
repeated. The lowest scavenger level investigated was 0.20%. (Table 2)
   Additional evaluation of successful scavengers considered their
hydroscopic nature and the expected likelihood to agglomerate. Also, to
confirm that enough scavenger remained to prevent HF formation during
additional processing steps, the preferred acid scavenger was initially
compounded at a level of 0.25% into the concentrate and the resulting
concentrate was re-compounded two times.
   Calcium stearate, DHT-4A, and magnesium oxide were determined to be
effective acid scavengers at 0.25 weight percent in the production of 20%
PTFE in GPPS concentrate. Irganox B225 was not effective at the levels
tested. Based on these results, calcium stearate was selected as the least
hydroscopic and having the smallest probability of agglomeration due to its
lower melting temperature and fine particle size. Re-compounding this
material two times produced no detectable HF after subsequent passes. Thus,
calcium stearate was incorporated into the production of the concentrate at
our contract compounder. No HF could be detected in the concentrate
produced, in sealed containers of the concentrate, or in any area of the
facility. Industrial hygiene monitoring has since been routinely conducted
and has failed to detect any HF.
20 It is reasonable to assume that the calcium stearate reacts with the
HF or HF-precursor to produce calcium fluoride (CaF2) and stearic acid.
Both of these reaction products are considered innocuous materials from an
industrial hygiene and reactivity standpoint, particularly at these low
concentrations. Stearic acid is known to act as a processing aid but at
these low levels it did not appear to impact extrusion conditions.
   This information may be useful to other processors, but it is important
to verify that acid scavengers will work in a particular system by
monitoring the level of HF in various areas.

RELATIVE STABILITY IN SUPPLY AND PRICING IS PROJECTED FOR MARKET

By:
Joseph A. Grande

   After a blockbuster 1994, demand for polystyrene eased to what many term
realistic levels in 1995. The market took off early in the year but fizzled
by mid-summer, as inventories soared, prices rose before settling in the
fourth quarter, and demand softened.
   In North America, demand dropped slightly. U.S. production of PS
declined by 0.9%, according to the Society of the Plastics Industry, while
sales and captive use were off by 2.6% over 1994.
   Western Europe and Japan were relatively flat as well. A bright spot in
Europe was expandable PS, which posted a 4% gain from demand for building
insulation in eastern Germany.
   The Far East enjoyed strong growth despite tight import restrictions in
China.
   Throughout the decade, PS should grow by 3 to 4% annually, says Edward
Glatzer, principal with consultant Chem Systems Inc., Tarrytown, NY, which
recently completed a study of the styrenics business. Glatzer said the
modest gains are attributed to more mature markets in North America and
Europe and the loss of export business in Japan to offshore companies.
Surging economies in the Far East, particularly China and India, will yield
double-digit growth in those areas.
   Suppliers see ample availability of feedstocks this year. Costs,
moreover, seem to have settled. Though prices rose through the summer in
North America and Europe, they have dropped 20 to 25%. Fewer imports into
China forced prices in the Far East to drop during the summer, says Karl
Foerster, PS market manager for BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany.
   Market-wise, in the U.S., observers agree that polystyrene is under less
pressure for material substitution. ``The easy substitutions by
polypropylene have been done; it's a lot slower than 3 or 4 years ago,''
said Marvin Sauers, PS business manager for Amoco Polymers, Alpharetta,
GA.
   In Europe, some volatility is possible, particularly in packaging
applications, because of the price gap between PP and PS (DM 0.90 to 1.20
for PP versus DM 1.60 for PS), says Bruno Barbet, product manager for Dow
Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.
   In North America and Europe, high-impact PS continues to penetrate the
business equipment market. As a less costly alternative to lower ABS and
PC/ABS, polystyrene finds growing use in keyboards, monitors, and housings
due to lower mechanical and thermal requirements.
   In 1995, polystyrene completed its virtual replacement of ABS in 3.5-in.
micro floppy disks, according to Richard Marchetti, director of market
development for Huntsman Chemical Co., Chesapeake, VA.
   Oriented PS, meanwhile, is making strides in rigid food packaging.
Grades with lower residual monomer don't affect the taste of packaged
goods.
   BASF, Mt. Olive, NJ, will unveil this year high-impact,
ultraviolet-light-stable grades that compete with PC/ABS in computer
housings. Under development are high-impact, high-gloss specialty grades
with 20% better melt flow, equivalent gloss, and improved impact compared
to the company's workhorse grade ES 9524. The materials would compete with
medium-impact ABS in small appliances and other consumer durables.
   There's not much expansion planned in the West this year, though BASF is
adding capacity in Mexico and the U.S., and Novacor, Leominster, MA, is
starting up 70 million lb. in Springfield, MA.
   Far East suppliers continue to build capacity, however, in response to
strong demand.
   One project made Zhanjiang Zhongmei Chemical Industries Co., Guangdong
Province, China's largest PS producer, when it added a second
88-million-lb./yr. line last year. The company is a Sino-American joint
venture, 70% owned by American Pacific Enterprises Group, Los Angeles, CA.

BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS OFFER TAILORED RATES OF DEGRADATION

By:
EDITED BY ROBERT D. LEAVERSUCH

   A number of biodegradable polymers have been developed that provide
precision-controlled degradation. These polymers are considered to be a
viable approach to plastics waste disposal in selected end-uses. They
include:
   -- Polyester amide is said to compost without residue at a rate
comparable to lettuce leaves. The semi-crystalline yet translucent material
resists solvents and light, has a melting point of 125C., and works in film
and fiber extrusion, and molding. Potential applications are garbage bags,
disposable flower pots, and mulch sheet. Bayer AG, Bayerwerk, D-51368,
Leverkusen, Germany
   -- Starch-based thermoplastic made from cereal feedstocks has
antistatic properties. The basic structure is comprised of copolyesters. A
plasticizer is blended on-line with the copolyester to form an antistatic
biodegradable material. Household and packaging films display toughness and
good elongation at break. BASF, Carl-Bosche Straabe 38, D-67056
Ludwigshafen, Germany
   -- Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) stays flexible from sub-zero to 130C.
temperatures, and biodegrades in a few months. The thermoplastic polyester
is a joint development of Biomer (a manufacturer of biodegradables) and PCD
Polymere, the European polyolefin supplier. Injection molding grades with
properties comparable to PS and PP run on conventional equipment. machines.
PCD Polymere, Danubiastrabe 21-25, A-2323, Schwechat-Mannsworth, Germany
   -- Aliphatic polyester works in PE, PP, and PS. Bionolle processes on
conventional processing equipment at 140 to 260 degrees C., in blown and
extruded films, foams, and injection molded products. Application areas are
paper lamination, trash bags, diapers, and cosmetic and beverage bottles.
Showa Highpolymer Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan
   -- Aliphatic polyester that biodegrades in soil as well as fresh and
ocean water areas, decomposes to water and carbon dioxide. Skygreen's rate
of degradation depends on grade, product shape, and level of
microbiological activity. Typically, degradation of a 40-mil-thick film
takes two months. Odorless material has properties similar to those of PE
and PP and can be readily processed on conventional equipment. Sunkyong
Industries Ltd., Kukdong Bldg., Choogmuro, Jung-Gu, Seoul 100-705, South

PBT MAKES A CLEAN SWEEP

   Thermoplastic polyesters allow the redesign of vacuum cleaner motors by
the Electrolux Group, Luton, U.K., yielding cost-performance benefits. The
motor's one-component, input air guide is molded from polybutylene
terephthalate, providing a smooth surface (for reduced turbulence) and
parts consolidation. The part had been a 10-component, stamped-metal
system. The air guide snapfits to a PET (Rynite 530) housing, eliminating
mechanical attachments. System cost is cut by less materials use and
simplified manufacturing. DuPont Engineering Polymers, P.O. Box 80713,

POLYETHERIMIDE RESINS

   POLYETHERIMIDE RESINS are said to improve processability and to optimize
the balance of heat and impact properties. Ultem HTX is targeted at
replacing stainless steel or high-performance polymers in medical and food
service markets. Notched Izod impact strength is 500% higher than a
standard polyetherimide grade. The new grade also features improved
chemical resistance for medically sterilizable applications. Ultem ATX is a
next-generation PEI/PC blend providing high impact strength, intermediate
thermals, and reduced cost. Unreinforced, the heat-distortion temperature
is 165 degrees C to 190 degrees C. Resin is for food-service applications
(microwaveable cookware, utensils), and also has potential in automotive
headlamp reflectors (it can be metallized without costly basecoat
procedures). GE Plastics, One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201
