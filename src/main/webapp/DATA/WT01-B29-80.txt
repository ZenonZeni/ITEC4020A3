<h1>DRUG REFORMERS ATTACK HOUSE BILL HR 666 </h1>

<p> California NORML Press Release: February 9, 1995 </p>

<p> <a name="DDE_LINK6"><b>DRUG REFORMERS ATTACK HOUSE BILL HR
666 &quot;THE BEAST&quot; FOR DOUBLE STANDARD ON EXCLUSIONARY
RULE</b> </a> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Outraged drug reformers denounced Congress' passing of a
bill, HR 666, nicknamed &quot;The Beast,&quot; which weakens the
exclusionary rule against illegal police searches in some cases,
such as drug offenses, but not gun trafficking or tax crimes. The
bill, which permits illegally seized evidence to be used if the
arresting police exercise &quot;good faith,&quot; was amended by
Rep. Harold Volkmer (D- Missouri) to exclude searches by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, out of concern for the
rights of gun owners. A similar amendment by Rep. James Traficant
(D-Ohio) excludes the IRS. </p>

<p> California NORML attacked HR 666 as &quot;A grotesque
travesty of justice,&quot; saying &quot;Whatever logic there may
be in the 'good faith' exception to the exclusionary rule is
totally obliterated by making an exception for particular
offenses. By what logic do we let the DEA run roughshod over the
Fourth Amendment when ferreting out home marijuana gardeners,
while making the BATF wear kid gloves in pursuing arms
traffickers?&quot; </p>

<p> Rep. Volkmer defended his amendment in light of the BATF's
misconduct at Waco, saying &quot;I haven't seen any agency as
abusive as the BATF.&quot; However, NORML counters that the DEA
is even more abusive. &quot;To speak of the DEA and 'good faith'
is an oxymoron,&quot; says California NORML coordinator Dale
Gieringer, &quot;This is an agency whose agents are trained
professional liars and chronic perjurers, engaged in trampling
the privacy of citizens, buzzing their land with helicopters,
spying on garden stores, seizing property without due process,
denying medicine to patients who need it, and running a network
of drug-dealing informants.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;HR 666 sets a constitutional double standard for
protection of privacy that violates the 14th Amendment right to
equal protection of laws. In effect, it says it's O.K. to play
loose with the rights of home marijuana gardeners, but not gun,
alcohol, or tax criminals. HR 666 subverts the Fourth Amendment,
the bulwark of our constitutional right to privacy. We call on
the Senate and President to reject this grotesque perversion of
justice.&quot; </p>
