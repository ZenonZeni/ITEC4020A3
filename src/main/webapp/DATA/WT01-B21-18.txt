<h1>I. Introduction </h1>

<p>The modern era of research into the effects of cannabis in man
began less than 20 years ago. Many issues about its health
hazards, as they are with all drugs, remain controversial and
ambiguous. Many adverse reactions to drugs were not recognized
until after much exposure had occurred. Often these are
idiosyncratic or allergic reactions. On the other hand, adverse
reactions due to the extensions of the pharmacological action of
a drug may be recognized both early and late. A similar pattern
holds for cannabis. The ambiguity currently surrounding the
health hazards of cannabis may be attributed to a number of
factors besides those which ordinarily prevail. First, it has
been difficult to either prove or disprove health hazards in man
from animal studies. When such studies of cannabis reveal
possible harmful effects, the doses used are often large and the
treatment is generally short. Second, cannabis is still used
mainly by young persons in the best of health. Fortunately, the
pattern of use is more often one of intermittent rather than
regular use, the doses of drug usually being relatively small.
This factor might lead to an underestimation of the potential
impact of cannabis on health. Third, cannabis is often used in
combination with tobacco and alcohol, among licit drugs, as well
as a variety of other illicit drugs. Thus, potential health
hazards from cannabis may be difficult to distinguish from those
of concomitantly used drugs. Finally, the whole issue of cannabis
use is so laden with emotion that serious investigations of
health hazards of the drug have been colored by the prejudices of
the experimenter, either for or against the drug as a potential
hazard to health. </p>

<p>Assessment of the therapeutic potentials of marijuana is also
clouded by prejudices, either for or against the drug. Virtually
every claim of therapeutic benefit made for marijuana is for a
condition for which there are already many effective treatments.
Thus, to justify the use of the new agent, it must be subjected
to the same elements of proof as a brand-new drug. Thus far, none
of the potential indications has been officially recognized. </p>

<p>This report will focus on three main areas: (a) acute and
chronic effects of cannabis in humans; (b) issues regarding its
possible adverse effects on health, including its effects on
driving ability; and (c) the therapeutic potential of cannabis
constituents or synthetic homologs of such constituents. </p>

<hr>

<h1>II. Acute and Chronic Effects of Cannabis in Humans</h1>

<h2>A. Acute Studies </h2>

<p>The availability of synthetic
trans-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major component of
cannabis, and the chemical techniques for quantifying its content
in cannabis preparations and in blood have made possible for the
first time pharmacological studies which provide some precision
in dose. When the material is smoked, as it is most commonly used
in North America, a variable fraction of THC is lost by smoke
escaping into the air or exhaled from the respiratory dead space.
Relatively little is lost by pyrolysis, since it is likely that
the cannabinoid is volatilized in advance of the burning segment
of the cigarette. The efficiency of the delivery of a dose by
smoking has been estimated to be about 18%, but frequent smokers
obtain 23%, while infrequent users obtain only 10% (110). THC and
marijuana extracts are also active by mouth; the systemic
bioavailability of oral administration is only about 6%,
one-third that from smoking (130). </p>

<p>When smoked, THC is rapidly absorbed, and effects appear
within minutes, If marijuana is of low potency, effects may be
subtle and brief. Seldom do they last longer than 2 to 3 h after
a single cigarette, although users prolong the effects by
repeated smoking. Oral doses delay the onset of symptoms for 30
min to over 2 h, as well as prolonging the span of action of the
drug. </p>

<p>These time schedules are consistent with knowledge of the
pharmacokinetics of the drug. Smoking is similar to i.v.
administration in producing maximum plasma concentrations early,
while p.o. administration produces slower rises of maximum plasma
concentrations, which are also lower than those for smoking (105,
130). Although the route of administration affects the time
course and the intensity of cannabis effects in man, the pattern
of these effects was well established by early investigators (84,
88). </p>

<p>All observers have commented on the constant increase in pulse
rate, often one of the first effects of the drug. Blood pressure
tends to fall slightly or remains unchanged; at higher doses,
orthostatic hypotension occurs. </p>

<p>Conjunctival reddening is also consistently observed. Both
this symptom and the increased pulse rate correlate quite well in
time with the appearance and duration of psychic effects of the
drug, as well as the plasma concentrations of the drug (6).
Muscle strength is decreased. Appetite is consistently augmented,
along with an increased food intake (80). Observed physiological
effects have not included changes in pupil size, respiratory
rate, or deep tendon reflexes. </p>

<p>Perceptual and psychic changes are biphasic. An initial period
of euphoria or &quot;high&quot; is followed by drowsiness. Time
sense is altered, hearing is less discriminant, and vision is
apparently sharper with many visual distortions. </p>

<p>Depersonalization, difficulty in concentrating and thinking,
dream-like states are prominent. Many of these symptoms are
similar to those produced by psychotomimetics. </p>

<p>The effects that users derive from cannabis are extremely
variable. Some of this variability depends on individual
variation in degree of tolerance to the drug, based on prior use.
Although it is customary to ascribe some variability to
difference in setting, i.e., the type of conditions and
surroundings which prevail during the drug use, or to set, i.e.,
the expectations of the user, proving the effects of either has
been difficult. </p>

<p>One study indicated that, with pharmacologically active doses
of the drug, extreme variations in setting produced little
alteration of drug effects, which were clearly different from
those produced by placebo (82). </p>

<h2>B. Chronic Studies</h2>

<p>The effects of chronic use of cannabis are more to the point
when considering the issues of its status as a possible social
drug. Three large-scale field trials of cannabis users have been
implemented, but the results of these trials have done little to
allay apprehensions about the possible ill effects of chronic
use. Objections have been made about the small samples used, the
sampling techniques, and the adequacy of the studies performed. </p>

<p>Jamaica is a country in which cannabis is widely used, under
the name ganja. </p>

<p>The content of THC in native cannabis is generally high,
estimated at severalfold that of cannabis generally supplied to
users in North America. </p>

<p>The average Jamaican user smokes seven to eight cannabis
cigarettes a day, such use not being considered deviant in that
country. Sixty adult workers, all men, were selected for study.
Thirty were ganja smokers, and thirty were not, although the
latter may have used cannabis tea. Extensive studies in the
hospital revealed no significant physical abnormalities between
the two groups. The smokers were found to be at greater risk of
functional hypoxia, which might have been due to the fact that
tobacco was also used by this group. Smokers claimed to use
cannabis to work better, but evidence in a selected subgroup
supported slightly decreased performance. The small sample and
the fact that impairment may be difficult to detect in unskilled
workers make it difficult to be sanguine about these generally
negative results (147). </p>

<p>A similar study was done in Costa Rica, another country in
which cannabis use is prevalent. Two groups of 80 subjects, users
and nonusers, were compared by a variety of clinical and
laboratory examinations. Essentially no difference between the
two groups was detected (34). Forty-seven chronic users of
hashish in Greece were compared with 40 nonusers, focussing
primarily on tests of brain damage. No evidence of abnormality in
function as judged by a variety of tests could be detected in the
hashish group as compared with the others. The hashish users had
a higher prevalence of personality disorders, probably unrelated
to their use of hashish but possibly contributing to it (49). </p>

<p>If field studies fail to provide evidence of harm from
prolonged use of cannabis, it is unlikely that experimental
studies will do better, and such has been the case. The results
of a 30-day high-dose cannabis study in which doses up to 210 mg
of THC per day were administered p.o. to volunteers were most
remarkable in how well the subjects tolerated such large doses
(93). </p>

<p>Tolerance was probably present in most subjects prior to the
study, but it was rapidly augmented during it. Under these
conditions, a mild withdrawal reaction was found when the drug
was abruptly discontinued. Additional unanticipated findings were
weight gain, bradycardia, and an absence of psychotomimetic
effects. As the amount of drug absorbed from p.o. administration
may be small, these results are only partially applicable to
smoking. </p>

<p>A longer experimental study in which cannabis was smoked
rather than taken p.o. exposed subjects from 35 to 198 mg of THC
daily for 78 days. The unique contribution of this study was the
discovery of the effects of cannabis in lowering intraocular
pressure. Other effects noted were lowering of serum testosterone
levels, airway narrowing after heavy use, lack of chromosomal
alteration, and unchanged immune responses (35). Other effects of
chronic cannabis use are related in a specific publication of the
New York Academy of Sciences on chronic cannabis use (31). </p>

<p>In summary, we have a very good idea of the acute effects of
cannabis, although these are tempered by the dose of THC, the
route of administration of the previous exposure of the user to
the drug, and possibly by their past experiences with it. The
effects of chronic use are somewhat less certain. </p>

<p>Experimental studies suggest that tolerance develops rapidly,
that a mild withdrawal reaction may occur, and that some acute
effects may be reversed (for instance, a slow heart rate with
chronic use rather than a rapid one as seen with acute use).
Field studies have failed to detect any major health consequences
from chronic heavy use of cannabis, but these studies have many
deficiencies, most studies being far too small to pick up unusual
or rare consequences that could be of great importance.
Nonetheless, one is forced to conclude that cannabis is a
relatively safe drug as social drugs go. To date it compares
favorably with tobacco and alcohol, if not caffeine. One should
bear in mind, however, the very long time that it took to
determine the ill effects of these accepted social drugs. </p>

<h1>III. Possible Adverse effects of Cannabis on Health</h1>

<h2>A. Immunity</h2>

<p>A number of in vitro studies, using both human and animal
material, suggest that cell-mediated immunity may be impaired
after exposure to cannabis. </p>

<p>Clinically, one might assume that sustained impairment of
cell-mediated immunity might lead to an increased prevalence of
malignancy, as seen in the current epidemic of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS). No such clinical evidence has been
discovered. Despite some degree of impairment of immune
responses, the remaining immune function may be adequate,
especially in the young person who are the major users of
cannabis. </p>

<p>An impairment of cellular immunity in 51 chronic users of
cannabis was shown by inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenesis from
mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (171). A decrease in T-lymphocytes
was found in 9 of 23 chronic cannabis users, employing rosette
formation as a way of quantifying T-lymphocytes; the number of
total lymphocytes was not different from nonusers (66). Thus, two
early studies suggested that T-lymphocytes might be decreased in
number as well as in ability to respond to an immunologic
challenge. immunosuppression was shown in animals by prolonged
allogenic skin graft survival, inhibited primary antibody
production to sheep erythrocytes, and a diminished blastogenic
response (109). </p>

<p>Further studies have tended to confirm an immunosuppressant
action of cannabis in animals, whether the material was given
p.o. or injected i.p. (144, 185). Mice treated with THC and
challenged with gram-negative bacteria showed enhanced
susceptibility (19). However, others using in vitro techniques
for studying lymphocytes, have found no alteration in nucleic
acid synthesis in the presence of as much as 10.6 x 10-4 M
concentrations of THC (137). </p>

<p>Effects of cannabis on T-cells may be transitory. Smoking of
cannabis temporarily decreased T-cell function in 13 chronic
users as compared with 9 matched nonsmokers, but the effects
varied from subject to subject and were closely related to the
time the blood samples were drawn (134). Although early T-cell
rosette formation was impaired in ten chronic cannabis smokers,
despite a normal total of circulating T-cells, the absence of
clinical evidence of greater disease susceptibility among such
subjects makes this observation of dubious clinical importance
(45, 126). </p>

<p>Other studies cast doubt on some of the earlier positive
observations of impaired cellular immunity. Dinitrochlorobenzene
is used as a skin test for intact delayed hypersensitivity,
mediated by cellular immunity. No differences were observed in 34
chronic marijuana smokers as compared with 279 nonsmokers (152).
The response of cultured lymphocytes from 12 long-term smokers of
cannabis to two mitogens was not impaired as contrasted with
lymphocytes from nonsmokers (178). Even the ingestion of cannabis
in amounts of 210 mg daily of THC failed to alter the response of
the subjects lymphocytes to mitogen stimulation (103). </p>

<p>In summary, evidence is difficult to interpret concerning a
possible suppressant effect of cannabis on cell-mediated
immunity. If suppression occurs, it may only be transient, in the
sense that recovery can occur. </p>

<p>Further, the degree may not be clinically significant as the
reserve capacity of the body to respond to immune challenge may
not be exceeded. We simply do not know how much impairment is
necessary to make someone vulnerable. </p>

<p>Clinical experience has not yet indicated an increased
vulnerability of cannabis users, but further observations of the
possible contribution of marijuana use to the susceptibility to
develop AIDS must be awaited. </p>

<h2>B. Chromosomal Damage </h2>

<p>Adverse effects on chromosomes of somatic cells have been
especially controversial. The techniques of human cytogenetic
studies still leave much to be desired. Assessing damage to
chromosomes is more of an art than a science. Interpretations are
highly subjective, and it is often difficult to get agreement
between any two readers of the same slide. Further, processing of
cells to make chromosomal preparations may differ from one
laboratory to another, so that it is possible to get conflicting
results from the same specimen even when read by the same reader.
One needs only recall the controversy about chromosomal damage
from lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) a few years ago to
interpret any reports of chromosomal damage with great caution.
As similar types and degrees of chromosomal alteration have been
reported in association with other drugs commonly used in medical
practice, without any clinical evidence of harm, the significance
of such changes remains unclear. Early reports were positive, but
more recent reports were negative. A significant increase (3.4
versus 1.2%) of chromosomal abnormalities was reported in
marijuana users as compared to nonusers (155). </p>

<p>Changes were largely breaks or translocations of chromosomes.
More of the latter were found in chronic cannabis users than in
nonusers, but when breaks were included in the counts, the
differences vanished (76). No increase in chromosomal breaks was
found in cells from subjects taking p.o. hashish extract (which
contains THC as well as cannabinol), marijuana extract
(containing only THC) or synthetic THC (128). After 72 days of
chronic smoking of cannabis, no increase in break frequency was
found over that which existed prior t the study (116). </p>

<p>Both the retrospective and prospective studies have flaws, and
one simply cannot conclude that the issue is settled. For that
matter, it has not yet been settled for a variety of drugs,
including aspirin, in which an increased number of chromosomal
abnormalities have been described. One must conclude for the time
being that, even if a small increase in chromosomal abnormalities
is produced by cannabis, the clinical significance is doubtful.<br>
</p>

<h2>C Pregnancy and Fetal Development</h2>

<p>This is another area of great uncertainty about the meaning of
data. </p>

<p>Virtually every drug that has been studied for dysmorphogenic
effects has been found to have them if the doses were high
enough, if enough species are tested, or if the treatment is
prolonged. The placenta is not a barrier to the passage of most
drugs, so the assumption should be made that they will reach the
fetus if taken during pregnancy (3). </p>

<p>This assumption is well validated for THC, based on
autoradiographic studies (87). A high incidence of stunting of
fetuses was seen in mice treated on day 6 of pregnancy with a
single i.p. dose of 16 mg of cannabis resin per kg. No reduction
in litter size or apparent malformations were seen. When the same
dose was given repeatedly from days 1 to 6 of pregnancy. Fetal
resorption was complete (133). Treatment of mice from days 6 to
15 of gestation with THC doses of 5, 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg had no
effect on fetal weight, prenatal mortality rate, and frequency of
gross external, internal, or skeletal abnormalities (50).
Exposure of pregnant rats to either cannabis smoke or smoke from
extracted marijuana throughout the gestation produced less
fertile offspring with smaller reproductive organs in cannabis
treated animals (12, 54). </p>

<p>Pregnant rabbits treated p.o. with daily doses of THC at 15
mg/kg on days 6 to 18 of gestation delivered infants without
visible abnormalities (36). </p>

<p>Injection s.c. of doses of THC up to 100 mg/kg daily on days 6
to 15 of gestation had no teratogenic effect (97). Fetal
resorption was seen in rats treated with s.c. doses of THC at 100
mg/kg for days 1 to 20 of gestation, but lesser doses had no
effect (18). </p>

<p>Clinical studies have also not elucidated the question. An
epidemiological study found more meconium staining of the fetus
and more disturbances of the duration of labor (either short or
long) among 35 users of marijuana as compared to 36 nonusers
(63). However, no significant difference was found between 19
moderate to heavy users and many more nonusers in regard to
several neonatal outcomes (53). Small sample sizes reduce the
confidence of results of either study. A much larger study
involved 12,424 women of whom 1,246 (11%) were marijuana users.
Lower birth weights, a shorter gestation period, and more major
malformations were found among the offspring of users (111). No
changes in serum human chorionic gonadotropin, placental
lactogen, progesterone, estradiol, and estriol were found in 13
women who smoked marijuana during pregnancy, compared with a
matched control number who did not (20). </p>

<p>In summary, it is still good practice in areas of ignorance,
such as the effects of drugs on fetal development, to be prudent.
While no definite clinical association has yet been made between
cannabis use during pregnancy and fetal abnormalities, such
events are likely to be rare at best and could be easily missed.
The belated recognition of the harmful effects on the fetus of
smoking tobacco and drinking alcoholic beverages indicates that
some caution with cannabis is wise. </p>

<h2>D. Cell Metabolism</h2>

<p>Information currently available for the effect of cannabis on
cell physiology and metabolism is limited. Smoke from both
cannabis and tobacco increased the size of cytoplasm, nuclei, and
nucleoli along with an increase in DNA content of human lung cell
explants. Mitotic abnormalities were also noted with an increase
of 10 to 25% over those of controls. Combination of both smokes
produced greater abnormalities than either one alone. Malignant
cell transformation of hamster lung culture was observed after
administration of both types of smoke (108). These findings
suggest that cannabis smoke is harmful to lung cells in cultures
and contributes to the development of premalignant and malignant
lesions. </p>

<p>Cannabinoids may also interfere with the normal cell cycle.
Experiments with protozoan, Tetrahymena, synchronized in culture,
showed a reduction in growth rate during log phase and
lengthening of the mean division time upon exposure of THC. These
changes were dose dependent (183). Addition of THC to various
human and animal cell cultures has been shown to decrease
synthesis of DNA&lt; RNA&lt; and protein (17). </p>

<p>The clinical implication of some of these findings is obscure.
On the one hand, exposure to smoke from cannabis may be
carcinogenic. On the other, the changes in nucleic acid
synthesis, were they to be specific for rapidly dividing cells,
such as those of malignancies, might be useful therapeutically in
their treatment. </p>

<h2>E Psychopathology</h2>

<p>Cannabis may produce directly an acute panic reaction, a toxic
delirium, an acute paranoid state, or acute mania. Whether it can
directly evoke depressive or schizophrenic states, or whether it
can lead to sociopathy or even to &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; is much less certain. The existence of specific
cannabis psychosis, postulated for many years, is still not
established. The fact that users of cannabis may have higher
levels of various types of psychopathology does not infer a
casual relationship. </p>

<p>Indeed, the evidence rather suggests that virtually every
diagnosable psychiatric illness among cannabis users began before
the first use of the drug. Use of alcohol and tobacco, as well as
sexual experience and &quot;acting-out&quot; behavior, usually
antedated the use of cannabis (68). When the contributions of
childhood misbehavior, school behavioral problems, and associated
use of other illicit drugs were taken into account, it was
difficult to make a case for a deleterious effect of regular
cannabis use (69). Thus, it seems likely that psychopathology may
predispose to cannabis use rather than the other way around. </p>

<h3>1. Acute panic reaction. </h3>

<p>This adverse psychological consequence of cannabis use is
probably the most frequent. About one in three users in one high
school and one in five in another reported having anxiety,
confusion, or other unpleasant effects from cannabis use. These
unpleasant experiences were not always associated with
unfamiliarity with the drug; some subjects experienced these
adverse reactions after repeated use (7). The conventional
wisdom, however, is that such acute panic reactions occur more
commonly in relatively inexperienced users of cannabis, more
commonly when the dose is larger than that to which users may
have become accustomed, and more commonly in older users who may
enter the drug state with a higher level of initial apprehension
(67). </p>

<p>The acute panic reactions associated with cannabis are similar
to those previously reported to be caused by hallucinogens. The
subject is most concerned about losing control or even of losing
his or her mind. Reactions are usually self-limited and may
respond to reassurance or &quot;talking down&quot;; in the case
of cannabis use, sedatives are rarely required as the inherent
sedative effect of the drug, following initial stimulation, often
is adequate. Occasionally one may see a dissociative reaction,
but this complication is readily reversible. Depersonalization
may be more long-lasting and recurrent, somewhat akin to
&quot;flashbacks&quot; reported following hallucinogens; the
electroencephalogram shows no abnormality (158). </p>

<h3>2. Toxic delirium. </h3>

<p>Very high doses of cannabis may evoke a toxic delirium,
manifested by marked memory impairment, confusion, and
disorientation (120). </p>

<p>This nonspecific adverse psychological effect is seen with
many drugs, but the exact mechanism is not clear in the case of
cannabis as it is in the case of Datra stramonium smoking, for
instance, which produces potent anticholinergic actions. As high
doses of any drug tend to prolong its action, delirium is
self-limited and requires no specific treatment. Highly potent
preparations of cannabis are not as readily available in North
America as in other parts of the world, so these reactions are
less commonly observed in the United States and Canada. </p>

<h3>3. Acute paranoid states. </h3>

<p>It is difficult to gauge the frequency of these reactions. In
a laboratory setting, they are frequently encountered. Quite
possibly the experimental setting creates a paranoid frame of
reference to begin with. That this reaction is not peculiar to
the laboratory is evident from reports in which it has been
experienced in social settings (96). The illegal status of the
drug might contribute in such instances, for while intoxicated,
one might be more fearful of the consequences of getting caught. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the degree of paranoia of the individual is also
an important determinant, so that this reaction may represent an
interplay between both the setting in which the drug is taken as
well as the personality traits of the user. </p>

<h3>4. Psychoses. </h3>

<p>A variety of psychotic reactions have been ascribed to
cannabis use. Many are difficult to fit into the usual diagnostic
classifications. Two cases of manic reaction were reported in
children who were repeatedly exposed to cannabis by elders. Both
required treatment with antipsychotic drugs but ultimately showed
a full recovery (16). Hypomania, with persecutory delusions,
auditory hallucinations, withdrawal, and thought disorder, was
observed in four jamaican subjects who had increased their use of
marijuana (71). Twenty psychotic patients admitted to a mental
hospital with high urinary cannabinoid levels were compared with
20 such patients with no evidence of exposure to cannabis. The
former group was more agitated and hypomanic but showed less
affective flattening, auditory hallucinations, incoherence of
speech, and hysteria than the 20 matched control patients. The
cannabis patients improved considerably after a week, while the
control patients were essentially unchanged (146). Thus, a
self-limiting hypomanic-schizophrenic-like psychoses following
marijuana has been documented. </p>

<p>Psychoses in a group of East Indian marijuana users were
predominantly instances of toxic delirium, but those who had
&quot;schizoid&quot; features became overtly schizophrenic during
the period of intoxication (30). The aggravating effect of
marijuana on preexisting schizophrenia has been documented (169).
</p>

<p>However, it was impossible to distinguish retrospectively
those individuals who exhibited behavioral changes in association
with marijuana smoking from those who did not (114). </p>

<p>A controversial clinical report of 13 adults with psychiatric
disorder associated with the use of cannabis included some who
had schizophrenic-like illnesses and one with depressive
features. The majority of these subjects had only used cannabis,
which was thought to be the major precipitant of their disorders
(98). A similar report from South Sweden involved 11 patients
observed over a 1-year period. None had previous psychosis or
abused other drugs. A mixture of affective and schizophrenic-like
symptoms, as well as confusion and pronounced aggressiveness was
observed. The mental disturbances were self-limiting and rare
(132). </p>

<p>It is impossible to think of any controlled trial that could
be designed to detect adverse psychiatric effects from chronic
use of a drug. Thus, clinical reports have long served as the
surest way to detect adverse effects of both social and medically
used drugs. Imperfect as such reports are, they can never be
ignored. </p>

<p>Chronic use of hashish among a group of military personnel was
tolerated quite well. Panic reactions, toxic psychosis, and
schizophrenic reactions were infrequent occurrences among this
group of 720 smokers, except when hashish was used in conjunction
with alcohol or other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p>Rather, these 110 subjects who used the highest doses (over 50
g/month) developed a chronic intoxicated state characterized by
apathy, dullness, lethargy, as well as impaired judgement,
concentration, and memory (163). </p>

<p>The paranoid psychosis associated with long-term cannabis use
was contrasted with paranoid schizophrenia in groups of 25 Indian
patients with each syndrome. The cannabis psychosis was
characterized by more bizarre behavior, more violence and panic,
an absence of schizophrenic thought disorder, and more insight
than was seen in the clearly schizophrenic group. The psychosis
with drug use cleared rapidly with hospitalization and
antipsychotic drug treatment and relapsed only when drug use was
resumed (164). If there is a true cannabis psychosis, this
description is probably most accurate. </p>

<p>It would seem reasonable to assume that cannabis might unmask
latent psychiatric disorders and that this action probably
accounts for the great variety that have been described following
its use. On the other hand, evidence for a specific type of
psychosis associated with its use is still elusive.
Hallucinogenic drugs have a similar property of unmasking latent
illness, but a drug such as LSD, being much more disruptive to
mental functioning than cannabis, is much more likely to
precipitate a true psychosis or depression. Needless to say, use
of cannabis should be discouraged (as would probably be the case
with most socially used psychoactive drugs) in any patient with a
history of prior emotional disorder (5). </p>

<h3>5. Flashbacks </h3>

<p>This curious phenomenon, in which events associated with drug
use are suddenly thrust into consciousness in the nondrugged
state, has never been satisfactorily explained. It is most common
with LSD and other similar hallucinogens but has been reported
fairly often with cannabis use. At first, it was thought that the
phenomenon occurred only in subjects who had used LSD as well as
cannabis, but more recent experience indicates that it occurs in
those whose sole drug use is cannabis (153). One possibility is
that flashbacks represent a kind of deja vu phenomenon. Another
is that they are associated with recurrent paroxysmal
seizure-like activity in the brain. The most unlikely possibility
is that they are related to a persistent drug effect. They may
occur many months removed from the last use of either LSD or
cannabis, so that it is highly unlikely that any active drug
could still be present in the body. Further, the interval between
last drug use and the flashback is one in which the subject is
perfectly lucid. For the most part, the reactions are mild and
require no specific treatment. </p>

<h3>6. Violence. </h3>

<p>The myth dies hard that cannabis makes otherwise docile
subjects violent. Virtually every experimental study of cannabis
that has tried to measure violent or aggressive behavior or
thoughts during cannabis intoxication has come to the same
conclusion; they are decreased rather than increased. A study of
40 college students focussed specifically on this problem,
comparing cannabis with alcohol. Expression of physical
aggression was related to the quantity of alcohol taken, but not
to any dose of THC (64). Similar findings have resulted from
surveys (162). Aggressive and sexually assaultive behavior in
delinquent adolescents was more common following use of alcohol,
even in those who also used cannabis (168). A review of the whole
subject of cannabis and violence came to the consensus that
cannabis does not precipitate violence in the vast majority of
users. </p>

<p>The possibility was entertained that a rare individual with
some special predisposition to aggressive or violent behavior may
be triggered into expressing such behavior under the influence of
the drug (2). </p>

<h3>7. Amotivational syndrome </h3>

<p>Whether chronic use of cannabis changes basic the personality
of the user so that he or she becomes less impelled to work and
to strive for success has been a vexing question. As with other
questions concerning cannabis use, it is difficult to separate
consequences from possible causes of drug use. I has long been
postulated that the apparent loss of motivation seen in some
cannabis users is really a manifestations of a concurrent
depression, for which cannabis may have been a self-prescribed
treatment (102). </p>

<p>The demonstration of such a syndrome in field studies has
generally been unsuccessful. Cannabis use among working men in
Costa Rica did not impair to any detectable degree their ability
to function (26). Much the same was found among Jamaican
laborers. No signs of apathy, ineffectiveness, nonproductiveness,
or deficits in general motivation were found (38). Each of these
approaches has been criticized on the basis that those surveyed
were unskilled workers in whom subtle impairment might be
difficult to detect. </p>

<p>However, a study of college students came to similar
conclusions (117). </p>

<p>Little evidence was adduced that dropping out of college was
associated with cannabis use. Family background, relationship
with parents during high school, and social values were stronger
forces than drug use. Thus, in subjects with moderate use
patterns of cannabis, no evidence of the amotivational syndrome
was detected (18). A similar survey of college students found no
significant relationship between marijuana use and achievement,
orientation, or actual performance (123). </p>

<p>Laboratory studies have provided only scant evidence for this
concept. A Canadian study showed a decrease in productivity
following the smoking of cannabis. The decreased building of
stools was due to less time worked than lessened efficiency at
work (122). Using an operant paradigm, volunteer subjects on a
research ward worked less as their consumption of cannabis
increased. The decreased work output might have been due to
decreased ability to work rather than decreased motivation (119).
The former possibility is not suggested by neuropsychological
testing of long-term users. No generalized decrement was observed
in adaptive abilities or cerebral functions (24). Similar results
were found in members of a United States religious sect that
relies on cannabis use. They showed no impairment of cognitive
functions on a number of neuropsychological tests (150). </p>

<p>If this syndrome is so difficult to prove, why does concern
about it persist? Mainly because of clinical observations. One
cannot help being impressed by the fact that many promising
youngsters change their goals in life drastically after entering
the illicit drug culture, usually by way of cannabis. While it is
clearly impossible to be certain that these changes were caused
by the drug (one might equally argue that the use of drug
followed the decision to change life style). The consequences are
often sad. </p>

<p>With cannabis as with most other pleasures, moderation is the
key word. </p>

<p>Moderate use of the drug does not seem to be associated with
this outcome, but when drug use becomes a preoccupation, trouble
may be in the offing. </p>

<h3>8. Residual psychomotor impairment </h3>

<p>Almost any task, if it is made difficult enough or if enough
dose of drug is given, can be shown to be impaired by acute
administration of cannabis. More to the point is whether
following chronic use impairment remains a problem. Experimental
studies in rats suggest that it does, but such studies are always
difficult to extrapolate to man (47). A comparison of 23 chronic
users of bhang (equivalent to about 50 mg of THC daily for at
least 5 years) with 11 nonusers revealed some evidence of
impairment in the users. The latter had lower intelligence and
memory quotients with lower scores on psychomotor tests (179).
For whatever reasons, studies of cannabis done in India tend to
show more evidence of impairment than those done elsewhere. </p>

<h3>9. Brain damage. </h3>

<p>The startling report of cerebral atrophy in ten young men who
were chronic users of cannabis aroused a great deal of
controversy (22). The subjects selected for the study were ones
who had come to psychiatric and neurological attention, besides
which they had used other drugs. Even the validity of the method
of measuring atrophy by comparing pneumocephalograms of the
patients with negative controls was questioned. A study in
monkeys provided some support for this observation. After 2 to 3
months of heavy to moderate exposure to marijuana smoke,
electrographic recording changes were noted in the septal region,
hippocampus, and amygdala which persisted 1 to 8 months after
smoke exposure stopped. Ultrastructure changes were seen in
synapses, as well as destruction of rough endoplasmic reticulum
and the presence of nuclear inclusion bodies. No such changes
were observed in animals exposed to smoke from extracted cannabis
(73). </p>

<p>The advent of computerized tomography reopened the question.
Two studies using this technique have effectively refuted the
original claim of brain atrophy. Nineteen men with long histories
of heavy cannabis smoking were examined, and none was found to
have brain atrophy as determined by this sensitive technique
(101). A similar finding was noted in the other study (33). On
the other hand, alcohol has long been thought to cause brain
atrophy, but recent studies suggest that it may be partially
reversible (23). </p>

<p>As brain atrophy from alcohol requires a substantial amount of
use, it is possible that with longer exposure, heavy users of
cannabis might show a similar pattern, but at present this seems
unlikely. </p>

<h2>F. Tolerance and Dependence</h2>

<p>Tolerance to cannabis has long been suspected to occur during
its continued use. Narrative accounts indicate that chronic users
of the drug either show very little effect from moderate doses or
require very large doses to produce characteristic intoxication.
A pioneer study of subchronic administration of cannabis and
synhexyl, a synthetic cannabinoid, suggests at best some degree
of tolerance to the euphoriant actions (180). Yet it has only
been in the past few years that tolerance to cannabis has been
clearly documented experimentally. </p>

<p>The demonstration of tolerance in man was delayed by ethical
restrictions on the amount of exposure permissible to human
subjects. For instance, in an early study subjects were exposed
only to a test dose of 20 mg of THC p.o. and then given the same
doses or placebos repeated at bedtime for 4 more days, followed
by the same THC dose as a challenge on the fifth day. Using such
small doses and relatively infrequent intervals, it was
impossible to show tolerance to the psychic effects of the drug,
although the tolerance to the tachycardia and dizziness produced
by the drug were evident (85). </p>

<p>Other early studies likewise suggested tolerance without
definite proof. </p>

<p>Tolerance to both tachycardia and &quot;high&quot; was
reported following 21 days of consecutive smoking of only one
cigarette a day by experienced smokers. It was possible that
these subjects may have already been tolerant to the drug (46).
Another study, in which subjects smoked a cannabis cigarette
containing 14 mg THC for 22 days, revealed a progressive decline
in the increase of pulse rate following smoking, an increase in
alpha rhythm on the electroencephalogram, and more decrement in
the performance of short-term memory and reaction time tasks
(49). </p>

<p>A number of other early studies provided less evidence of
tolerance. Little evidence of tolerance to clinical effects of
cannabis was found from daily smoking of marijuana cigarettes
over a period of 10 to 28 days (51, 142). </p>

<p>Free choice of marijuana cigarette for 21 days also provided
little evidence to support the concept of tolerance in man (165).
Meanwhile, substantial evidence had accumulated that tolerance
could be shown in various animal species, especially with high
doses of THC given for prolonged periods. </p>

<p>Definite evidence of tolerance to the effects of THC in man
was adduced only when it became permissible to use comparably
large doses over longer periods of time. Subjects in one 30-day
study were given high doses (70 to 210 mg/day) of THC p.o. around
the clock. Tachycardia actually became bradycardia, and a
progressive loss of &quot;high&quot; was noted (49). Similar
tolerance to cannabis smoking was observed in a 64-day study in
which at least one cigarette daily had to be smoked with smoking
as desired later in the same day. Additionally, in this study
tolerance developed to the respiratory depressant effect of THC
(13). </p>

<p>The pattern that has emerged in man, therefore, is that
tolerance is not a problem when the doses are small, or
infrequent, or where the pattern of use of the drug is not
prolonged. Tolerance only becomes a major factor with high,
sustained, and prolonged use of the drug. It is interesting that
no study in man or animals ever revealed any evidence for
&quot;reverse tolerance&quot; or sensitization, such as had been
reported in an early, rather naive clinical study of marijuana
(176). </p>

<h3>1. Cross-tolerance </h3>

<p>THC has effects which in man somewhat resemble those of
hallucinogens and strongly resemble those of alcohol, while in
animals it slightly resembles morphine. No cross-tolerance to
mescaline or lysergide (LSD) could be shown in rats (151). Rats
tolerant to the effects of THC were also tolerant to ethyl
alcohol, but when the situation was reversed, less tolerance to
THC was seen in the alcohol-tolerant animals (127). Perhaps this
difference in sequential tolerance is why THC has never become
established as a treatment for alcohol withdrawal, despite some
early clinical trials that suggested a favorable effect.
Cross-tolerance between THC and morphine has been shown in rats
using customary tests of analgesia (95). </p>

<h3>2. Physical dependence. </h3>

<p>Evidence from both animals and man indicates that physical
dependence can be induced by abuse of THC. All monkeys given
automatic injection doses of THC of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg showed
abstinence signs when withdrawn. when monkeys were allowed to
self-administer the drug for 3 to 8 weeks, the majority had an
abstinence syndrome when the drug was abruptly discontinued. the
syndrome appeared approximately 12 h after the last
administration and lasted about 5 days. it was characterized by
irritability, aggressivity, tremors, yawning, photophobia,
piloerection, and penile erections (95). </p>

<p>In man, a somewhat similar, though mild, withdrawal reaction
was uncovered after abrupt cessation of doses of 30 mg of THC
given every 4 p.o. for 10 to 20 days. Subjects became irritable,
had sleep disturbances, and had decreased appetite. Nausea,
vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea were encountered. </p>

<p>Sweating, salivation, and tremors were autonomic signs of
abstinence (49). </p>

<p>Relatively few reports of spontaneous withdrawal reactions
from suddenly stopping cannabis use have appeared, despite the
extraordinary amount of the drug consumed, Five young persons
experienced restlessness, abdominal cramps, nausea, sweating,
increased pulse rate, and muscle aches when their supplies of
cannabis were cut off. Symptoms persisted for 1 to 3 days (15).
The rarity of reports of these reactions may reflect the fact
that they are mild, and seldom is a user completely cut off from
additional drug. </p>

<p>Cannabis would have been an exceptional centrally acting drug
if tolerance/dependence were not one of its properties. The fact
that tolerance was not strongly recognized as an effect of
chronic use was due to the narrative nature of previous accounts
of tolerance in man and the lack of systematic animal
experimentation. Tolerance has now been proven for most of the
actions of THC. It develops at varying rates for different
actions, but it is rapidly reversible. large doses of THC are
required over long time periods for tolerance to develop. As most
social use of the drug does not meet those requirements, neither
tolerance nor dependence has been a major issue in its social
use. </p>

<h2>G. Endocrine and Metabolic Effects</h2>

<p>Changes in male sex hormones have been a source of controversy
ever since the first report of a cannabinoid-induced decrease in
serum testosterone level. </p>

<p>Decreased levels were associated with morphological
abnormalities in sperm and with decreased sexual functioning
(100). Such changes must require long-term exposure to cannabis,
for subchronic studies in experimental subjects have generally
failed to confirm these findings (118). During the first 4 weeks
of a chronic administration study, no major changes in hormone
levels were detected, but with subsequent exposure a decrease
first occurred in luteinizing hormone (LH) followed by decreases
in testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (99).
Testosterone synthesis by Leydig cells was decreased in rats,
both by THC as well as by other cannabinoids (21). A similar
finding had been reported earlier (57). A review of the
literature on this subject concluded that no significant effect
was found in regard to serum testosterone and that sperm
production was decreased but without evidence of infertility.
Ovulation was inhibited, and luteinizing hormone was decreased.
Cannabinoids had no evidence of estrogenic activity, which had
been postulated earlier (4). </p>

<p>The meaning of such changes in man is uncertain, as the
hormone levels generally remained within the accepted limits of
normal. Further, a single hormone level may not be truly
representative of the prevailing levels of hormones that tend to
be secreted episodically or which are subject to many extraneous
influences. </p>

<p>Data on the effects of cannabis on the female reproductive
system are sparse. </p>

<p>Preliminary unpublished data indicate that women who use
cannabis 4 times a week or more have more anovulatory menstrual
cycles than do nonusers of the same age, Animal work tends to
support this observation. THC administered to rats suppressed the
cyclic surge of LH secretion and of ovulation (11). </p>

<p>Gynecomastia has been thought to be a complication of cannabis
use, especially when it was also possible to stimulate breast
tissue development in rats with THC (72). Eleven soldiers with
gynecomastia of unknown cause were matched with 11 others with
similar characteristics except for gynecomastia. No difference in
cannabis use was found between the two groups (27). Such a
finding does not disprove the relationship between cannabis and
gynecomastia. Indeed, if cannabis increases peripheral conversion
of testosterone to estrogens, then it is possible that the
increased estrogens could stimulate breast tissue in a few
susceptible men. Increased estrogens might also account for some
reports of diminution in sexual drive or in performance in men. </p>

<p>These endocrine changes may be of relatively little
consequence in adults, but they could be of major importance in
the prepubertal male who may use cannabis. At least one instance
of pubertal arrest has been documented. A 16-year-old boy who had
smoked marijuana since age 11 had short stature, no pubic hair,
small testes and penis and low serum testosterone. After stopping
smoking, growth resumed and serum testosterone reached the normal
range (41). </p>

<p>As recent surveys of cannabis use indicate that some boys (and
girls) may be exposed to it even as early as the prepubertal
years, this question is of more than academic interest. </p>

<p>Although cannabis has been said in the past to cause
hypoglycemia, this error has been pointed out in numerous
studies. On the contrary, some subjects showed impaired glucose
tolerance following experimentally administered i.v. doses of 6
mg of THC. Such a dose is probably greater than one generally
attains from usual cigarettes but might be obtained from
high-grade hashish. </p>

<p>The deterioration of glucose tolerance was accomplished by
increased levels of plasma growth hormone, as well as by a normal
plasma insulin response. </p>

<p>these findings suggested that growth hormone might be
interfering with the action of insulin (83). A study in rabbits
indicated that blood glucose was increased by single doses of THC
but that this increase could be prevented by adrenalectomy.
Increased release of epinephrine following THC was postulated as
a possible cause for the hyperglycemia (70). Although large doses
of THC might aggravate diabetes, the rarity of this phenomenon in
clinical practice may be due to the lower doses of THC used
socially or the development of tolerance to this specific
pharmacological effect. </p>

<h2>H. Lung Problems</h2>

<p>Virtually all users of cannabis in North America take the drug
by smoking. As inhaling any foreign material into the lung amy
have adverse consequences, as is well proven in the case of
tobacco, this mode of administration of cannabis might also be
suspect. Smoking is most efficient method for administering the
drug, due to the enormously high lipid solubility of THC. </p>

<p>The pulmonary surfactant is a perfect trap for THC which is
then rapidly absorbed into the blood. the kinetics of the THC
administered by smoking are similar to those of its i.v.
administration. </p>

<p>Heavy use of hashish by soldiers produced a number of
bronchopulmonary consequences, including chronic bronchitis,
chronic cough, and mucosal changes of squamous metaplasia, a
precancerous change (74). Although at first THC was thought to be
a respiratory depressant, more careful studies indicated that it
was when given p.o. in doses of 22.5 mg (14). thus, its use in
any form by patients with impaired pulmonary function would be
hazardous. </p>

<p>Young, healthy volunteer subjects in a chronic smoking
experiment had pulmonary function tests before and after 47 to 59
days of daily smoking of approximately five marijuana cigarettes
a day. Decreases were found in forced expiratory volume in 1 s,
in maximal midexpiratory flow rate, in plethysmographic specific
airway conductance, and in diffusing capacity. </p>

<p>Thus, very heavy marijuana smoking for 6 to 8 weeks caused
mild but significant airway obstruction (161). </p>

<p>Quite possibly such dramatic early changes are not progressive
with continued smoking (171). Compared with tobacco, cannabis
smoking yields more residue (&quot;tar&quot;), but the amount of
smoke inhaled is very likely to be considerably less. The study
in which five cigarettes were consumed daily represented heavy
use of the drug, compared with 20 to 40 tobacco cigarettes which
might be consumed by a heavy tobacco smoker. Low values for
specific airway conductance were found in marijuana smokers, a
change not observed in tobacco smokers. This change indicates
mild impairment of large airway function. No differences were
found between marijuana smokers and nonsmokers in spirometric
indices, closing volumes, or nitrogen concentrations between 750
and 1250 ml of expired air (159). Marijuana smoke inhibits
pulmonary antibacterial defense systems, mainly alveolar
macrophages, in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxin involved
is not related to any psychoactive component (86). One would
assume that marijuana smokers might be more susceptible to
bacterial infections of the lung, yet such increased
susceptibility has not been clinically documented. </p>

<p>The issue of damage to lungs from cannabis is somewhat
confounded by the fact that many cannabis users also use tobacco.
As yet, it is far easier to find pulmonary cripples from the
abuse of tobacco than it is to find any evidence of clinically
important pulmonary insufficiency from smoking of cannabis. </p>

<h2>I. Cardiovascular Problems </h2>

<p>Tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and increased blood
concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin from cannabis smoking would
undoubtedly have deleterious effects on persons with heart
disease due to arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries or
congestive heart failure. Although a slight trend toward
increased use by persons over age 30 years has been detected in
recent epidemiological studies, it is unlikely that many persons
with serious heart disease will be exposed to this hazard from
cannabis use. </p>

<p>Tachycardia is a consequence of almost every acute dose of
cannabis, although some degree of tolerance develops to this
effect. Evidence suggests that it is mainly due to an inhibition
of vagal tone (32). Increasing the heart rate and thereby cardiac
work might be harmful to patients with angina pectoris or
congestive heart failure. A direct test of the effects of
marijuana smoking in exercise-induced angina proved this harmful
effect of the drug. Smoking one cigarette containing 19 mg of THC
decreased the exercise time until angina by 48%. Smoking a
marijuana placebo cigarette decreased the exercise time until
angina by only 9%. thus, smoking marijuana increased myocardial
oxygen demand and decreased myocardial oxygen delivery (9). A
subsequent study compared the effect of this type of marijuana
cigarette with that of a high nicotine cigarette. the marijuana
cigarette decreased the exercise time by 50%; the nicotine
cigarette decreased the exercise time to angina by 23% (10).
Clearly, smoking of any kind is bad for patients with angina, but
the greater effect of cannabis in increasing heart rate makes
this drug especially bad for such patients. Fortunately, few
angina patients are devotees of cannabis. </p>

<p>A rapid heart rate might be expected to aggravate congestive
heart failure. </p>

<p>Actually, little is known about the direct effects of THC on
myocardium. A single study using an isolated rat heart reported a
negative inotropic effect from THC, i.e., weaker contractibility
of muscle (115). If so, the use of cannabis by patients in
congestive heart failure could make matters even worse. </p>

<p>Premature ventricular contractions have been reported
following marijuana smoking (91). However, when subjects were
continually monitored electrocardiographically while smoking
cigarettes containing approximately 20 mg of THC, no increase in
such premature beats was found (145). Ventricular premature beats
are rarely observed and do not seem to be of any great clinical
importance. </p>

<h2>J. Eye Problems</h2>

<p>Eye complaints of cannabis users are vague and mild. All 350
cannabis users had some eye complaints. Several consistent
findings were (a) photophobia and belpharospasms; (b) injection
of the globe; (c) increased visibility of the corneal nerves; and
(d) accommodative or refractive changes. Visual acuity was
preserved, but pupillary reactions were sluggish. Both alcohol
and cannabis produced a moderately debilitating effects on
lateral phoria and abduction. During smoking, lacrimation may be
observed along with the characteristic marked conjunctival
injection. Despite the fact that numerous and complex changes
occur in the eyes of cannabis users, these effects are confined
to the anterior segment and in most respects mimic an irritative
process of that region. they are transient and not cumulative.
the are probably of little clinical significance (60). </p>

<p>Reduction intraocular pressure is a characteristic effect from
cannabis. this action provides distinct therapeutic possibilities
and will be discussed later. </p>

<h2>K. Contamination of Cannabis</h2>

<p>The most definite health hazard was contamination of cannabis,
largely of Mexican origin, by the herbicide paraquat. Inhalation
of toxic amounts of this material could lead to severe lung
damage, and some instances of acute toxicity have occurred.
Paradoxically, this hazard stemmed from efforts to save cannabis
users from less well-documented hazards to their health. </p>

<p>Estimates of the amount of contaminated cannabis reaching
North America may have been grossly exaggerated due to false
positive results in testing for paraquat. Formerly as much as
one-third to one-half of Mexican cannabis was assumed to be
contaminated. the results of later analyses suggest that only
about 10% is contaminated. the problem still remains for the
users as to how to identify such a contaminated product. </p>

<p>One thought has been to look for red spots on the marijuana
leaves. this approach may be difficult for the leaves are usually
available in a finely ground form. A red fluorescence is seen
under ultraviolet light, such as is commonly used in
discotheques. A similar red fluorescence may be seen on the lips
of the smoker of paraquat contaminated cannabis. </p>

<p>After the experience with paraquat in Mexico, its use was
temporarily discontinued. Recently, the possibility that it may
be used against cannabis crops in California and Hawaii has
surfaced. One would hope that over-zealous law enforcement would
not once again pose a serious health risk to marijuana users. </p>

<p>Cannabis is generally harvested like any other crop. The final
product of ground leaves and stems look very much like grass cut
by a mower. usual insecticides and fungicides are rarely used, as
the plant grows abundantly with minimal care. Other sources of
contamination may include insects and fungi. </p>

<h2>L. Possible Accumulation of Drug</h2>

<p>The major if not sole active component of cannabis, THC, is
highly lipid soluble. As the human body has a high lipid content,
which includes not only body fat, but also brain and most cell
membranes, lipid-soluble drugs tend to leave the blood rapidly to
be distributed to fatty tissues. It is characteristic of such
drugs that the action of a single dose is terminated not by the
elimination of the drug through metabolic processes, but by
redistribution to sites in the body where it cannot act. The
prime example of such a drug is pentothal sodium, which rapidly
produces anesthesia when given i.v. but which has a very short
span of action. the drug still remains in the body, but in places
where it cannot act. A similar situation applies to the widely
used sedative drug, diazepam. </p>

<p>An early study of the pharmacokinetics of THC examined its
tissue distribution following a single injection of radiolabeled
material, the concentration of THC in fat was 10 times greater
than for any other tissue examined and persisted in this tissue
for 2 weeks. Thus, there is good evidence that THC and its
metabolites might accumulate not only in fat, but also in brain
(107). </p>

<p>Obviously, similar studies could not be done in man. One can
measure in man the extraction of cannabis metabolites following
single or repeated doses, to get some idea of their persistence.
Following both single and repeated doses (at least single doses
for several days), metabolites of cannabis of cannabis can be
found in urine for varying periods, up to several days following
the last dose (94). All of these metabolites are ones that are
known to have no mental effects, except for a minuscule amount of
unchanged THC which is excreted during the first 4 h following a
dose, while the drug is having definite clinical effects. The
excretion of these metabolites is not accompanied by any evidence
of cannabis-like effects. </p>

<p>We may conjecture that THC rapidly leaves the blood to be
sequestered in fatty tissues. It is either gradually metabolized
in these tissues to inactive metabolites which are then excreted
in the urine, or it may be gradually released from these tissues
in small amounts to be metabolized by the liver before attaining
effective plasma concentrations. In either case, there is no
evidence of a continuing drug effect from this accumulation of
drug in the body. </p>

<p>No one has yet reported on the excretion of metabolites
following prolonged exceedingly high dose administration of THC.
In one study in which doses of up to 210 mg of THC were given
p.o., abrupt discontinuation of the drug led quickly to mild
signs of a withdrawal reaction (49). As the development of
withdrawal reactions is contingent upon a rapid decline to the
pint of absence of active drug in the body, one must assume that
no accumulation of active drug occurred even under extreme
circumstances. </p>

<p>In short, the apprehension about accumulation of THC from
repeated use is based on evidence indicating only the
accumulation of drug that is either in inactive form to begin
with or which is rendered inactive before reaching the
circulation in any pharmacologically active amount. We do not
know the full toxicity of many of the possible metabolites which
might accumulate, but generally toxicity studies of cannabis and
its constituents lead to the inescapable conclusion that it is
one of the safest drugs ever studied this way. </p>

<h2>M. Effects on Driving an Automobile</h2>

<p>If marijuana is to become an accepted social drug, it would be
important to know its effects on driving ability. Fully one-half
of the fatal car crashes in the United States are associated with
another social drug, alcohol. </p>

<p>Neither experimental nor epidemiological approaches to the
marijuana question have yet provided definitive answers. </p>

<p>Many studies have used acute doses of marijuana or THC to
study various psychomotor functions. these can be summarized by
saying that, if the dose of drug was high enough or the task
difficult enough, impairments were shown. It is difficult to
determine how pertinent these tests are to the actual driving of
an automobile. Furthermore, it is difficult to relate the effects
of acute consumption of marijuana, often in relatively naive
subjects, to effects that may be found in chronic users, who may
have developed some degree of tolerance. </p>

<p>Studies on the acute effects of marijuana on simulated driving
have shown mixed results. the first compared smoked marijuana
(doses uncertain) with ethanol in sufficient quantities to
produce alcohol levels of 100 mg/dl. </p>

<p>Marijuana increased speedometer errors but produced no
deviation from the norm on accelerator, brake, signal, steering,
or total errors. Alcohol had a far more deleterious effect (43).
Marijuana administered p.o. in doses of 8. </p>

<p>12 and 16 mg was compared with a dose of 70 g of alcohol in
eight volunteer subjects performing a simulated driving task.
Both marijuana and alcohol increased the time to brake and to
start, but these changes were confined to the 16 mg dose of THC
(138). Marijuana was smoked with the intention of administering
doses of 0, 50, 100, and 200 *g/kg, a most dubious assumption. </p>

<p>No significant deviations from the norm were noted in car
control and tracking aspects (124). </p>

<p>Actual driving in normal traffic situations would more closely
mimic real-life situations, including the dangers. Sixty-four
volunteer subjects smoked cigarettes containing 0, 4.9, or 8.4 mg
of THC. Oddly enough, THC had a biphasic effect, causing
deterioration of driving skills in some subjects and improvement
in others. A recently completed study compared the effects of
smoking a marijuana cigarette with or without alcohol, alcohol
alone, and placebos for each drug. Actual driving was done over a
course rigged with various traffic problems. Both drugs produced
impairment of driving performance, the combination being worse
than either alone (141). </p>

<p>Fifty-nine subjects smoked marijuana cigarettes until
&quot;high&quot; and then were periodically tested by highway
patrol officers on the roadside sobriety test. </p>

<p>Overall, 94% of the subjects failed to pass the test 90 min
after smoking and 60% after 150 min, despite the fact that by
then plasma concentrations of THC were rather low (81). It
appeared that establishing a clear relation between THC plasma
concentrations and the degree of clinical impairment will be much
more difficult than has been found in the case of alcohol (140).
The exact prevalence of persons who might be picked up while
driving under the influence of marijuana is uncertain. One survey
found at least 5 ng of THC per ml in blood specimens of 14.4% of
a random sample of 1792 drivers detained for erratic driving.
Many were associated with blood levels of alcohol as well (184). </p>

<p>Flying an airplane is much more difficult than driving an
automobile, but the general principle of impairment are similar.
Ten certified pilots who smoked marijuana or placebo were tested
on a simulator. The results were highly variable from pilot to
pilot and from skill to skill. It was assumed that the pilots had
regained full function after 4 h (90). Somewhat contrary results
were obtained in another similar study which found, however, some
degree of impairment in flying skills as long as 24 h after an
exposure to marijuana. </p>

<p>The subjects were unaware of any such impairment (182). </p>

<p>The issue is not clearly settled, but common sense would
suggest that it would be unwise to try to drive an automobile
soon after exposure to marijuana. In our first study with the
drug, the subjects were asked during the period of their
intoxication, &quot;Would you be able to drive a car now?&quot;
Their uniform answer was, &quot;You've got to be kidding.&quot;
The biggest areas of doubt are how long the impairment, even
though subtle, may last and how to deal forensically with driving
while under the influence of marijuana. the best evidence at
present would be to assume that any amount of THC more than 10
ng/ml in plasma is presumptive evidence of impairment. such a
decision is arbitrary, but so have been forensic decisions about
the presumed level of intoxication with alcohol. </p>

<h1>IV. Therapeutic Uses</h1>

<p>For many centuries, cannabis was used as a treatment, but only
during the 19th century did a particularly lively interest
develop for exploiting its therapeutic potential. Cannabis was
reported to be effective in treating tetanus, convulsive
disorders, neuralgia, migraine, dysmenorrhea, post partum
psychoses, senile insomnia, depression, and gonorrhea, as well as
opium or chloral hydrate addiction. In addition, it was used to
stimulate appetite and to allay the pain and anxiety of patients
terminally ill with cancer (64, 121). However, the advent of
modern pharmacology beginning in the 20th century discovered many
other drugs more definitely effective in these disorders, with a
subsequent decrease in the enthusiasm for cannabis as a
therapeutic agent. </p>

<p>Advances in the chemistry of cannabis during the 1940s
established tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the major active
component. A semisynthetic THC-like material, synhexyl, was
tested as a therapeutic agent during the late 1940s and early
1950s. Initial trials reported efficacy as an antidepressant and
as a treatment for alcohol or opiate withdrawal, but subsequent
clinical evaluations were negative (156,166). </p>

<p>The exact structure of THC was shown in 1964 to be
delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol, which was soon synthesized.
The relative abundance of this material permitted extensive
laboratory and clinical studies from 1968 onwards. These studies
have included potential therapeutic uses. </p>

<p>At the present time, a number of pharmaceutical houses have
programs to develop cannabinoids as therapeutic agents. The major
problem is to separate the specific desired pharmacological
effect from the pronounced mental effects of cannabinoids. A
number of reviews of the potential therapeutic uses of cannabis
have been published recently (36, 92, 104). We will now discuss
some indications of current interest. </p>

<h2>A Antiemetic for Patients in Cancer Chemotherapy</h2>

<p>Cancer chemotherapy, especially with the agent cisplatin,
produces severe nausea and vomiting, which is extremely difficult
to treat with ordinary antiemetic drugs, such as
prochlorperazine. This complication is so severe that many
patients forego effective cancer chemotherapy. The antiemetic
effects of cannabis had been suggested as early as 1972 (6). THC
was first tried as an antiemetic in a controlled trial comparing
it with placebo in 20 patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
Fifteen mg were given to some patients and 20 mg to the others in
the form of gelatin capsules containing THC dissolved in sesame
oil. The initial dose was started 2 h before chemotherapy and
repeated 2 and 6 h later. Fourteen of the 20 patients in whom an
evaluation could be made reported a definite antiemetic effect
from THC, while none was observed from placebo during 22 courses
of that drug (149). </p>

<p>Since then, studies have been largely confirmatory but not
entirely so. </p>

<p>Fifty-three patients refractory to other treatments were
studied in an uncontrolled fashion. Ten had complete control of
vomiting when THC was administered prior to chemotherapy and for
24 h thereafter. Twenty-eight had 50% or more reduction in
vomiting, and only 15 patients showed no therapeutic effect
whatsoever. However, four patients were dropped from the study
because of adverse effects (113). Fifteen doses of 15 mg of THC
were compared with 10-mg doses of prochlorperazine in a
controlled cross-over trial in 84 patients. THC produced complete
response in 36 of 79 courses, while prochlorperazine was
effective in only 16 of 76 courses. Twenty-five patients received
both drugs, of whom 20 preferred THC. Of the 36 courses of THC
that resulted in complete antiemetic response, 32 were associated
with mental effects characterized as a &quot;high&quot; (148).
Another comparison between THC in 15-mg doses and
prochlorperazine in 10-mg doses versus a placebo control was made
in 116 patients who received p.o. doses 3 times a day. The THC
regimen was equal to prochlorperazine, and both were superior to
placebo. However, many patients who received THC found it to be
unpleasant (55). A comparison of THC with placebo was made in 15
patients with each patient acting as his or her control. Fourteen
of the 15 patients given THC obtained more relief of nausea and
vomiting than from placebo during a course of high-dose
methotrexate chemotherapy (28). Best results were obtained when
plasma concentrations of THC were more than 120 ng/ml. Such
concentrations would ordinarily be expected to produce rather
definite mental effects, THC was compared with two other
antiemetics, thiethylperazine and metoclopramide, in a controlled
cross-over trial. No difference was found between the antiemetic
effect of these three agents. However, adverse effects of THC
were sufficiently greater than those from the other two drugs,
which raised questions about its clinical utility (37). When THC
was compared with prochlorperazine and placebo, the latter two
treatments were not found to differ, but THC was superior to
either one (131). </p>

<p>In summary, it would appear that THC has definite antiemetic
effects, that these are comparable to many other commonly used
antiemetic agents such as prochlorperazine, thiethylperazine, and
metoclopramide, but that the major disadvantage of the drug is
the mental effects produced by the doses given. </p>

<p>A synthetic homolog of THC, nabilone, was developed in 1972
and has been tested extensively for antiemetic activity.
Across-over study comparing nabilone with prochlorperazine in 113
patients revealed significantly greater response rates following
nabilone therapy. However, side effects from nabilone were also
more common (77). Although it was hoped that nabilone separated
the antiemetic effects from the mental effects of THC, this goal
was not fully achieved. Levonantradol and BRL 4664 are two other
synthetic THC homologs which showed antiemetic effects in open
studies (43, 154). The exact role of synthetic homologs of THC as
antiemetic agents remains to be determined. </p>

<p>Currently, a large amount of data on the clinical use of THC
as an antiemetic is being accumulated in therapeutic situations
monitored by the Food and Drug Administration. Unfortunately,
this massive amount of clinical experience has no control, so
that it may be impossible to conclude more than what is already
known. Meanwhile, extremely promising results have been obtained
with larger than usual i.v. doses of metoclopramide. When this
drug was compared with prochlorperazine and placebo, it was more
effective than either, the only disturbing side effect being
sedation (59). The doses used of metoclopramide were 1 mg/kg i.v.
before treatment with cisplatin (perhaps the most emetic
anticancer drug) and several times after treatment. Protection
was total in 48% of courses and major in another 23% (157). </p>

<p>This experience with metoclopramide suggests that the whole
issue of the antiemetic effects of THC may become moot, as there
are other drugs such as domperidone, which may also be effective
in this situation. </p>

<h2>B. Glaucoma</h2>

<p>Discovery of the ability of cannabis to lower intraocular
pressure was more or less fortuitous. Intraocular pressure was
measured as part of a multifaceted study of the effects of
chronic smoking of large amounts of cannabis. Intraocular
pressure was found to decrease as much as 45% in 9 of 11
subjects, 30 min after smoking (75). Lowered intraocular pressure
lasted 4 to 5 h after smoking a single cigarette. Its magnitude
was unrelated to the total number of cigarettes smoked. the
maximal effect on intraocular pressure was produced by the amount
of THC absorbed in a single cigarette containing 19 mg of THC.
When patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma were tested 7
of 11 showed a fall of intraocular pressure of 30%. Confirmatory
evidence was obtained from a trial in which i.v. injection of THC
in doses of 22 *g/kg and 44 *g/kg produced an average fall in
intraocular pressure of 37%, with come decreases as much as 51%
(40). Many experiments done in rabbits using various routes of
administration, including instillation of cannabinoids into the
eye, have confirmed the ability of cannabis to reduce intraocular
pressure. </p>

<p>Topical administration would ne especially desirable for
treating glaucoma as with other drugs used for this purpose.
Smoking cannabis or taking THC i.v. </p>

<p>would be totally unsuitable for patients with glaucoma.
Rabbits have been used traditionally for studying eye
medications. The lipid solubility of THC has been overcome by
using mineral oil as the vehicle for its instillation into the
eye. The degree of lowering of intraocular pressure is at least
as great as that with conventional eye drops, such as
pilocarpine, and the duration of effect is often longer. Some
minimal systemic absorption of the drug occurs when it is applied
to the conjunctivae, but it is of no consequence in producing
mental effects. Other cannabinoids besides THC, such as
cannabinol or 8-alpha- and 8-beta-11-dihydroxy-delta-9-THC, have
also produced this effect in rabbits (62). These agents have no
mental effects, which makes them of considerable interest for
therapeutic use. </p>

<p>An extract of nonpsychoactive components of cannabis whose
composition is still uncertain has been tested both alone and in
combination with timolol eye drops in patients with increased
intraocular pressure. The effects of the two agents are additive
and are said to be effective when other measures have failed
(177). BW 146Y, a synthetic THC homolog, has been given p.o. to
glaucomatous patients. Unfortunately, mild orthostatic
hypotension and subjective effects were noted in addition to
reduced intraocular pressure (167). </p>

<p>No psychoactive component of cannabis can be considered as a
feasible therapeutic agent in this situation. Intraocular
pressures, although they are reduced acutely, have not been shown
to be reduced following long-term treatment, nor has there been
any demonstration that visual function is preserved by the use of
cannabinoids in glaucoma. Some of the problems associated with
the development of cannabinoids as treatment for glaucoma have
already been cited (61). The exploitation of cannabinoids for
treatment of glaucoma will require much further developmental
work to ascertain which cannabinoid will be lastingly effective
and well tolerated. The potential benefits could be great, as
present-day glaucoma treatment still does not prevent blindness
as often as it might. If the effects of cannabinoids are additive
to those of other drugs, the overall benefit to patients may be
greater than is currently possible with single drugs. </p>

<h2>C. Analgesia</h2>

<p>Smoking of material estimated to deliver 12 mg of THC
increased sensitivity to an electric shock applied to the skin
(78). Single p.o. doses of 10 mg and 20 mg of THC were compared
with codeine (60 mg and 120 mg) in patients with cancer pain. A
20 mg dose of THC was comparable to both doses of codeine. The 10
mg dose, which was better tolerated, was less effective than
either dose of codeine (129). THC given i.v. in doses of 44 *g/kg
to patients undergoing dental extraction produced an analgesic
effect, which was less than that achieved from doses of 157 *g of
diazepam per kg i.v. Several of these patients actually preferred
placebo to the dose of 22 *g of THC per kg because of anxiety and
dysphoria from the latter drug (139). </p>

<p>The apparent paradox is that THC both increases and decreases
pain. </p>

<p>Traditionally, aspirin-like drugs, which work peripherally by
inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, are used to treat
pain derived from the integument. The initial mental stimulation
from THC might increase sensitivity to this kind of pain.
Visceral pain, such as that of cancer patients, is usually
treated by opiates, which have both peripheral and central sites
of action. Recent evidence suggests that opiates may act directly
on pain pathways in the spinal cord as well as reducing the
effect that produces pain. Cannabis could conceivably modify the
effective response. </p>

<p>Thus, when the two types of pain are distinguished from each
other, the apparent paradox is solved. </p>

<p>THC, nantradol, and nabilone shared some properties with
morphine in chronic spinal dog model. Latency of the skin twitch
reflex was increased, and withdrawal abstinence was suppressed.
Naltrexone did not antagonize these actions, suggesting that they
are not mediated through opiate receptors (56). </p>

<p>Levonantradol i.m. was compared with placebo in postoperative
pain, and a significant analgesic action was confirmed. No
dose-response relationship was observed, and the number of side
effects from levonantradol was rather high (89). It seems
unlikely that any THC homolog will prove to be analgesic of
choice, when one considers the present array of very effective
new analgesics of the agonist-antagonist type. It is too early to
be sure, however. </p>

<h2>D. Muscle Relaxant</h2>

<p>Patients with spinal cord injuries often self-treat their
muscle spasticity by smoking cannabis. cannabis seems to help
relieve the involuntary muscle spasms that can be so painful and
disabling in this condition. A muscle relaxant or antispastic
action of THC was confirmed by an experiment in which p.o. doses
of 5 or 10 mg of THC were compared with placebo in patients with
multiple sclerosis. The 10 mg dose of THC reduced spasticity by
clinical measurement (135). Such single small studies can only
point to the need for more study of this potential use of THC or
possibly some of its homologs. </p>

<p>Diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, and dantrolene, which are
used as muscle relaxants, all have major limitations. A new
sleetal muscle relaxant would be most welcome. </p>

<h2>E. Anticonvulsant</h2>

<p>One of the first therapeutic uses suggested for cannabis was
as an anticonvulsant. Such an effect was documented
experimentally many years ago (112). Subsequent studies in
various animal species have validated this action. THC in cats
temporarily reduced the clinical and electrographic seizure
activity induced by electrical stimulation of subcortical
structures (175). Mice were protected by cannabidiol against
maximal electroshock seizures but not against those caused by
pentylenetetrazole. Its profile of activity more resembled that
of phenytoin than that of THC (170). THC and cannabidiol both
potentiated the anticonvulsant effects of phenytoin against
electrically induced seizures in mice. The two cannabinoids in
combination produced the most effect (29). Kindling involves the
once-daily application of initially subconvulsive electrical
stimulation to culminate in generalized convulsive seizures. THC
given chronically to rats prevented the kindling effect (174). </p>

<p>Clinical testing has been rare, despite all these various
lines of evidence supporting an anticonvulsant effect of
cannabinoids. Better control of seizures following regular
marijuana smoking was reported in a not very convincing single
case (39). Fifteen patients not adequately controlled by
anticonvulsants were treated with additional cannabidiol in doses
of 200 or 300 mg or placebo. Cannabidiol controlled seizures
somewhat better that the addition of placebo (25). Cannabidiol
has little if any psychoactivity, making it a good candidate for
this use. </p>

<h2>F. Bronchial Asthma</h2>

<p>A general study of the effects of marijuana on respiration
revealed a bronchodilating action in normal volunteer subjects.
Marijuana smoke was calculated to deliver 85 or 32 *g of THC per
kg. A fall of 38% in airway resistance and an increase of 44% in
airway conductance occurred in the high-dose group. The low-dose
group showed lesser changes, but they were still significant as
compared with baseline. The sensitivity of the respiratory center
to carbon dioxide was not altered by either dose, indicating no
central respiratory depression (172). </p>

<p>Asthma was deliberately induced by either inhalation of
methacholine or exercise in asthmatic patients. They were then
treated with inhalation of placebo marijuana, of saline, of
isoproterenol, or of smoke derived from marijuana containing 1 g
of THC. Both marijuana smoke and isoproterenol aerosol
effectively reversed both methacholine- and exercise-induced
asthma, while saline and placebo marijuana had no effect (160).
Aerosols of placebo-ethanol, of THC (200 *g) in ethanol, or of
salbutamol (100 *g) were tested in another study of ten stable
asthmatic patients. Forced expiratory volume in 1-s forced vital
capacity, and peak flow rate were measured on each occasion. Both
salbutamol and THC significantly improved ventilatory function.
Improvement was more rapid with salbutamol, but the two
treatments were equally effective at the end of 1 h (181). </p>

<p>Both delta-8 and delta-9-THC have bronchodilating effects,
while neither cannabinol nor cannabidiol has such actions. Thus,
this action resides only in the psychoactive material. No
evidence of tolerance to this effect developed over 20 days of
continual administration (58). The treatment of asthma is much
more chronic; further studies of tolerance will be needed. </p>

<p>Some patients might experience bronchoconstriction following
THC. Doses of 10 mg p.o. produced mild and inconsistent
bronchodilator effects as well as significant nervous system
effects. One patient of the six studied developed severe
bronchial constriction (1). Mild but significant functional
impairment, predominantly involving the large airways, was found
in 74 regular smokers of cannabis. Such impairment was not
detectable in individuals of the same age who regularly smoked
tobacco (64). </p>

<p>THC would be best administered by aerosol for this purpose,
but whether effective doses would avoid the mental effects is
uncertain. The mechanism of action by which THC increases airway
conductance may be different from the usual beta-adrenergic
stimulants. Resistance to repeated applications of
beta-adrenergic stimulants does occur. Another type of
bronchodilator might help some patients. The recent introduction
of highly effective steroid aerosols, such as beclomethasone,
meets that need to a considerable extent. </p>

<h2>G. Insomnia</h2>

<p>THC does not differ from conventional hypnotics in reducing
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (136). THC in doses ranging from
61 to 258 *g/kg produces in normal subjects increments in stage 4
sleep and decrements in REM sleep, but without the characteristic
REM rebound which follows chronic treatment with hypnotics. When
THC was administered p.o. as a solution in doses of 10, 20, and
30 mg, our subjects fell asleep faster after having mood
alterations consistent with a &quot;high.&quot; Some degree of
&quot;hangover&quot; the day following was noted from larger
doses (42). Another sleep laboratory study showed that a dose of
20 mg of THC given p.o. decreased REM sleep. After four to six
nights of use, abrupt discontinuation of THC produced mild
insomnia but not marked REM rebound (52). REM rebound may not be
apparent after low doses of THC. However, very high doses (70 to
210 mg) reduced REM sleep during treatment and were followed by
marked REM rebound after withdrawal (48). </p>

<p>The sleep produced by THC does not seem to differ much from
that of most currently used hypnotics. Side effects before sleep
induction as well as hangover effects make the drug less
acceptable than currently popular benzodiazepines. It seems
unlikely that THC will supplant existing hypnotics in treatment
of insomnia. </p>

<h2>H. Miscellaneous Uses</h2>

<h3>1. Hypertension. </h3>

<p>Orthostatic hypotension occasionally follows use of THC (5). A
dimethylheptyl side-chain derivative has more profound and
constant effects on blood pressure. In man, this compound showed
a marked orthostatic hypotensive effect, as well as tachycardia
and some mental symptoms resembling THC. While the latter are
less than from THC in proportion to the blood pressure-lowering
effect, a definite separation of pharmacological effects has not
been attained (106). </p>

<p>Effective antihypertensive drugs have been one of the
outstanding achievements of pharmacology over the past 30 years.
A new antihypertensive based on orthostatic hypotension, perhaps
the least desirable mode of lowering blood pressure, is hardly
very enticing (8). The issue seems hardly worth pursuing further.
<br>
</p>

<h3>2. Abstinence syndromes due to central nervous system
depressants. </h3>

<p>Synhexyl, the first THC homolog to be synthesized, was tested
as a treatment for withdrawal reactions from opiates and alcohol
with little evidence of efficacy. Withdrawal symptoms experienced
by rats following morphine pellet implantation, followed by
subsequent injection of naloxone, were reduced by THC.
Cannabidiol, without any direct effect itself, augmented the
action of THC (79). </p>

<p>This relatively weak effect of cannabinoids in opiate
dependence is unlikely to be of clinical use. Detoxification
programs using methadone have been highly successful and
acceptable. </p>

<h3>3. Antineoplastic activity</h3>

<p>Both the delta-8 and delta-9-THC isomers, as well as
cannabinol, have some antineoplastic effect on transplanted lung
tumors in animals, as well as on tumors in vitro (125). THC may
have a general ability to reduce the synthesis of nucleic acids,
which may account for reported immunosuppressant effects as well.
Many agents are available that inhibit nucleic acid synthesis, so
the possibility that THC or other cannabinoids might be
advantageous seems rather unlikely. </p>

<h3>4. Antimicrobial action</h3>

<p>Both THC and cannabidiol inhibit and kill staphylococci and
streptococci in vitro at concentrations of 1 to 5 *g/ml (173).
Such concentrations are well above those reported for use of THC
in man, even at the highest tolerated doses. Thus, this effect
seems to have little practical application. </p>

<h3>5. Migraine</h3>

<p>This indication has not been studied systematically in recent
years, although it has a long history. In one patient I treated,
the mental effects sought socially caused the patient to abandon
treatment. Innumerable successful treatments for migraine have
been reported at one time or another. </p>

<h3>6. Appetite stimulant</h3>

<p>Most antipsychotic agents will stimulate appetite, but few
other drugs do. </p>

<p>THC as compared with ethanol and dextroamphetamine produced a
variable response on appetite, both in fed and fasted subjects.
The majority had increased appetite and food consumption as
compared with placebo (80). </p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa might be helped by an appetite stimulant. A
test of the presumed appetite-stimulating properties of THC in
patients with anorexia nervosa failed over a 4-week period. Doses
of THC ranged between 7.5 and 30 mg/day and were compared with 30
mg of diazepam per day and placebo. Three of the 11 patients
treated with THC experienced severe dysphoria (65). </p>

<h3>7. Alcoholism.</h3>

<p>Cannabis users are said not to drink, but most do. The
prospect of changing an alcoholic into a cannabinolic has some
appeal. A study showed that cannabis was not very attractive to
alcoholics. Little difference in retention occurred among those
given no medication, or a cannabis cigarette, or disulfiram or
the combination of the cigarette and disulfiram (143). </p>

<h1>V. Summary</h1>

<p>Marijuana seems firmly established as another social drug in
Western countries, regardless of its current legal status.
Patterns of use vary widely. As with other social drugs, the
pattern of use is critical in determining adverse effects on
health. Perhaps the major area of concern about marijuana is
among the very young. Using any drug on a regular basis that
alters reality may be detrimental to the psychosocial maturation
of young persons. Chronic use of marijuana may stunt the
emotional growth of youngsters. Evidence for an amotivational
syndrome is largely based on clinical reports; whether marijuana
use is a cause or effect is uncertain. A marijuana psychosis,
long rumored, has been difficult to prove. No one doubts that
marijuana use may aggravate existing emotional disorders. Brain
damage has not been proved. Physical dependence is rarely
encountered in the usual patterns of social use, despite some
degree of tolerance that may develop. </p>

<p>The endocrine effects of the drug might be expected to delay
puberty in prepubertal boys, but actual instances have been rare.
As with any material that is smoked, chronic smoking of marijuana
will produce bronchitis; emphysema or lung cancer have not yet
been documented. Cardiovascular effects of the drug are harmful
to those with preexisting heart disease; fortunately the number
of users with such conditions is minimal. Fears that the drug
might accumulate in the body to the point of toxicity have been
groundless. </p>

<p>The potential deleterious effects of marijuana use on driving
ability seem to be self-evident; proof of such impairment has
been more difficult. The drug is probably harmful when taken
during pregnancy, but the risk is uncertain. </p>

<p>One would be prudent to avoid marijuana during pregnancy, just
as one would do with most other drugs not essential to life or
well-being. No clinical consequences have been noted from the
effects of the drug on immune response, chromosomes, or cell
metabolites. Contamination of marijuana by spraying with
defoliants has created the clearest danger to health; such
attempts to control production should be abandoned. </p>

<p>Therapeutic uses for marijuana, THC, or cannabinoid homologs
are being actively explored. Only the synthetic homolog,
nabilone, has been approved for use to control nausea and
vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. </p>

<p>While little doubt remains that marijuana, THC, and nabilone
are effective for this use, the advent of other drugs that are
equally effective but with fewer adverse effects may make this
use moot. Use of marijuana to reduce intraocular pressure in
patients with glaucoma requires a feasible topical preparation of
cannabinoids. Although some cannabinoids have analgesic activity,
the abundance of new opioid analgesics with little dependence
liability provides tough competition. The use of marijuana as a
muscle relaxant, though promising, has not yet been adequately
studied. Clinical studies to establish the efficacy of
cannabidiol as an anticonvulsant or to compare it with other
anticonvulsants are still to be done. Other potential therapeutic
uses, such as treatment of bronchitis, asthma, insomnia,
hypertension, abstinence syndromes, migraine, anorexia, and
alcoholism, are most unlikely prospects. </p>

<p>Compared with other licit social drugs, such as alcohol,
tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not pose greater risks. One
would wonder, however, if society were given a choice based on
current knowledge, whether these drugs would have been granted
their present status of acceptance. Marijuana may prove to have
greater therapeutic potential than these other social drugs, but
many questions still need to be answered. </p>
