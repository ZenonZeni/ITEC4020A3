<P>All too often gardeners in the west face frequent concerns about water shortages and mandatory rationing.  Periods of extremely low rainfall, coupled with rapidly growing populations and limited reservoir capacity in some areas has prompted municipalities to institute measures to reduce outside water use.  Should gardeners he concerned?  Does this mean loosing that prized collection of lilies?  While water use restrictions may mean an inconvenience for some, they do not signal an end to gardening.  During the eighties, many areas, such as the central coast of California, endured extended periods of drought.  Gardeners simply adapted and learned how to conserve water while their gardens continued to thrive.</P>

<P>Conservation begins with wise water use.  The first step should be to check existing sprinkler systems and outdoor faucets for leaks; even a slow drip can add up to hundreds of gallons of lost water in a very short time.  Repair leaks, and replace worn washers with new ones.  At the same time, check the a pattern of your sprinklers to ensure that your water is going where you want it, on your garden - not your neighbor's driveway or the sidewalk where it will be lost to evaporation.  This is also a good time to repair that leaky hose that has dribbled water down your arm for years when you watered your hanging flower baskets.  A new hose end costs very little, a new washer even less, and you can save a substantial amount of water with these simple repairs.</P>

<P>Saving water may also require a change in your watering schedule.  Many gardeners make the mistake of watering in the heat of midday when water is lost to evaporation.  Instead, water during cooler periods of the day, early morning and late evening.  To avoid diseases like powdery mildew, early watering schedules are best, because the water has time to evaporate from the leaf surfaces while the day warms up.  Automatic timers can make early watering easier: They can be set to go on at dawn and to shut off the water after running for a specific time.</P>
<A NAME="soil"> <H1>Soil</H1>
<P>Learning to determine how much water to use is another important component of wise water use.  Different plants will require different amounts of water, and different soils will have different water needs.  Begin by establishing what type of soil you have.  Generally, there are three different kinds of
soils: sand, loam, and clay.</P>
<UL>
 <LI><P>Sandy soils will have a gritty feel if rubbed in the palm of your hand.  The bigger particles in sandy soil create large air spaces between particles that allow for good drainage and fast water infiltration.  Unfortunately sandy soils are often so well drained that they do not retain water well.
<LI><P>Clay soils are the other extreme: Composed of fine particles that will fell smooth and slippery when rubbed in the palm of your hand, clay soils have very small spaces between particles.  This causes them to absorb water more slowly making them prone to runoff.  On the positive side however, soils of this type can hold significantly more water than sandy soils.</P>
<LI><P> Loamy soils lie somewhere in the middle of these two extremes, and often share the properties of easy infiltration balanced with good moisture retention. 
</UL> 
<P>Regardless of soil type there is one factor that can substantially improve the ability of all soils to retain moisture: Compost.  The spongelike quality of compost allows it to hold substantial amounts of water in a form available to plants.  Incorporate compost when planting, or add it to existing beds by carefully working it into the soil around plants.  Because of the absorbent nature of compost, you may have to use more water initially to thoroughly wet your soil, but you should be able to go longer between waterings, saving in the long run.  Compost can also be used as a mulch, which will help conserve moisture by reducing the loss of water from the soil due to evaporation.  At the same time, it acts like an absorbent covering for the soil which aids in the infiltration of water into the soil and reduces runoff.  In general, compost is one of the most cost effective improvements you can make to drought-proof your garden.  All of our <B>Whitney Farms</B> composts and soil amendments provide you with an outstanding source of high quality organic matter to help you enhance and maintain the natural reservoir in your soil.</P>

<P>Learn to judge when to water by the color and feel of your soil.  Dig down 8-12 inches and grab a handful of soil.  Most soil with adequate moisture will look relatively dark, feet moist to the touch, and will form a ball under light pressure.  If your soil won't form a ball and looks dry, it is time to water.  It will take a while to become expert at this, but a good, sense of moisture comes with practice.</P>

<A NAME="plants"> <H1>Plants</H1>
<P>The kind of plants you are growing will also influence your watering methods.  Different plants have different watering needs.  Deeply rooted shrubs, for instance, will not have the same requirements as shallow rooting annuals.  It is important when planning your garden that you take into account these differences so that plants can be grouped by water requirements and thus be maintained more easily without wasting water.  Remember that the way you water will also determine the rooting depths of the plants in your garden.  If you water frequently with small amounts of water, you will encourage your garden to develop shallow roots close to the surface that require almost daily applications of water.  For healthy root systems that grow deep into the soil for moisture, water deeply as infrequently as possible.  Even lawn grasses, usually thought of as shallow rooted, can be encouraged to root as deeply as 10 to 24 inches, which allows them to tap reserves of moisture lower in the soil, but only if the gardener waters deeply and infrequently.  If you have questions about the watering requirements of plants in your garden or the kind of root systems that you can expect to develop, consult the staff at your local nursery for further information.

<A NAME="fertilizers"> <H1>Fertilizers</H1>
<P>An important consideration is the kind of fertilizers you use.  Because most inexpensive synthetic fertilizers are salts, they can compete for moisture with plants during time of drought.  At the same time, extremely soluble forms of nitrogen can encourage tender succulent growth which increases the demand for water in the plant.  Avoid these problems by using <B>Whitney Farms</B> fertilizers.  Our natural organic products are not salt based, and add valuable organic matter to your soil when you fertilize.  Because they are slow release, they also allow the plants to grow at a more gradual natural rate and make more efficient use of the water available to them.</P>
<A NAME="watering"> <H1>Watering</H1>
<P>The kind of sprinkler you use will also have an influence on your ability to conserve water.  Sprinklers come in a wide variety of styles and sizes.  Ideally a sprinkler should apply water like a light spring rain with fine gentle droplets.  This allows the water to soak into the soil gradually and helps to limit compaction of the soil, Additionally, some sprinklers have motions that allow the water time to soak in between cycles.  This will also aid in reducing compaction and the loss of water to runoff.  It is better to have a number of small sprinklers that do an excellent job of covering different areas of your garden than to try to adapt one sprinkler to a variety of different uses.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most important tools for reducing water use in the garden are soaker hoses and drip systems.  Both soaker hoses and drip systems apply water at such low rates that local authorities will often exempt them from many of the water restrictions.  And because they do not spray water directly onto the foliage, these systems will also allow you to irrigate at night when there is the lowest chance of evaporation.  Soaker hoses are the easiest and least expensive to use; they hook up to your spigot and the water leaches out from tiny holes along the entire length of the hose.  They are best suited to intensively planted areas like vegetable gardens or ground covers where they is little concern if the area between plants is watered as well.
Drip systems are similar to soaker hoses and have the added advantage of allowing the gardener to apply precise amounts of water to specific areas.  They are made up of a variety of little "drippers" (which are small outlets that meter the flow of water) and the tubing and connectors necessary to supply them.</P>

<P>It is clear that gardeners have tools available that can help their gardens flourish through periods when water is in short supply.  In fact, it is the experience of many gardeners in California that their gardens grew better when they were on watering restrictions.  Why?  Many gardeners discovered they were simply over watering, while others discovered that they were wasting water with short shallow sprinklings that quickly evaporated and left their gardens thirsty.  Some gardeners even found ways to save water in the home to ensure that they would have an adequate supply for their plants.  While the possibility of watering restrictions may be in our future, they will not mean an end to gardening.  Rather it will encourage more efficient water use through careful planning and the many water saving technologies available to gardeners today.  At <B>Whitney Farms </B>we are dedicated to helping you have a rich, healthy soil that will allow your garden to make optimum use of the water available to it.</P>
