Growth vs. Value: Does It Pay to Have Style?</H2><P>
<HR>

In the fashion world, those who are style-conscious constantly monitor the pulse of popularity in an effort to determine the trend-setting style for the year.<p>


The investment world has its own haute couture, with certain trendsetting styles that are "in" one year and "out" the next. Among fashion-conscious stock investors, two styles in particular are closely monitored: value investing and growth investing. <p>


Investment fashion watchers generally concur that growth investing has been "in" for several years, but that the fashion tide is now turning. How can they tell? Most of the evidence is observational. For instance, growth-oriented stocks appear to have been the herd leaders of the bull market over the past several years, while more recent winners have been value-oriented stocks. Another indicator is the varied performance experiences of mutual funds using the two different approaches. Several well-known and highly regarded value-oriented funds slipped in years past, but have more recently recovered--both movements that have been attributed in part to their investment style.<p>


Although these observations are not backed up by research, it is not illogical to assume that each style would do better during different parts of the market cycle. That's because the two approaches will tend to produce portfolios that focus on different segments of the market, and different market segments do better at various times within a market cycle.<p>


Recent articles in the popular financial press have promoted the "new" idea that investment success can be achieved by being fashion-conscious and riding the current trends. All you have to do, for instance, is invest in a mutual fund that's using the investment style--either growth or value--that is currently doing well, and when that style runs out of favor, move to the other style.


Is this really a new and useful idea? It is certainly not new; it is more of a repackaged idea not much different from market sector rotation--putting money into the various parts of the market at different stages of the economic cycle in an attempt to hit a segment as it peaks. It is also a form of market timing, and the problem is that if you are wrong, you risk considerable losses from the area you have chosen, and you risk missing out on the segment that actually is doing well.<p>


Concentrating on one approach exclusively violates two important investing concepts:<p>

<ul>
<li> Individuals should be diversified in terms of the kinds of stocks they are invested in, and<p>


<li>Individuals should be diversified across various time periods, with a long-term (over five years) investment horizon.<p>
</ul>

That doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile knowing the differences in the two styles, since it may help you avoid being unknowingly concentrated in one area.<p>


Growth investing consists of looking at companies that are showing above-average increases in earnings or sales, or those that operate in industries or sectors of the market that have exceptional growth potential.<p>


One good example is the CGM Capital Development Fund (formerly Loomis-Sayles Capital Development). The fund's prospectus states: <p>


"The fund may invest in many types of companies. These companies include: well-established companies with records of above-average growth and with promise of maintaining their leadership positions in their industries; companies likely to benefit from internal revitalization or innovations, changes in consumer demand or basic economic forces; and smaller companies with good management and attractive prospects ...."<p>


This focus is reflected in the fund's holdings. The fund's annual report, dated December 31, 1990, notes that the fund's largest industry positions are drugs and hospital supplies, which alone accounted for 42% of its holdings. The fund also has holdings in health care services, which account for about 8% of the portfolio.<p>


Twentieth Century's Growth Investors fund uses a similar approach, choosing stocks "primarily for their growth potential." Its holdings (as of October 31, 1990) included 20% in pharmaceuticals, 16% in computer systems, software and peripherals, and 13% in energy.<p>


Clearly, both funds have their eyes on sectors of the market that are currently viewed as having significant future growth prospects.<p>


Value investing, on the other hand, looks for undervalued situations. These investors seek stocks with low price-earnings ratios, companies selling below book value or with "hidden" assets that are not reflected in the stock's price.<p>


The Vanguard Windsor fund is an excellent example of a value investor. The prospectus states:<p>


"The fund invests primarily in common stocks, which are selected principally on the basis of fundamental investment value. Crucial to the valuation process is the relationship of a company's underlying earning power and dividend payout to the market price of its stock. The fund's holdings usually are characterized by relatively low price-earnings ratios and meaningful income yields. At the time of purchase, many of the fund's securities are considered to be undervalued or overlooked by the market."<p>


The fund's holdings? As of October 31, 1990, among the largest were banks, 14%; automotive, 12%; and airlines, 7%. These are certainly not industries you would currently mention when discussing growth potential.<p>


All three of these funds have had good long-term track records and portfolio managers who are highly regarded. And they have had individual years in which they fell out--most notably 1988 for Twentieth Century Growth and CGM Capital, and 1990 for Windsor.<p>


The lesson is not to avoid styles. If you invest on your own, you have to start somewhere in order to choose a group of stocks. But be aware that relying on one style may result in a concentrated portfolio--one that may not necessarily be focused on a particular firm or industry, but rather on a group of industries that may perform similarly given the same economic conditions.<p>


If you are a mutual fund investor, you should be aware of the portfolio manager's approach. A well-managed mutual fund will have a style that can be clearly understood by reading the prospectus and looking at the fund's reports. Some funds may use a mixture of styles, in which case you may want to check the fund's holdings to see if any one particular style appears to predominate. But if you invest in several stock funds, make sure you are not duplicating one fund's efforts--and the risks--by investing in a similar fund.<p>


In the investment world, you should be aware of style, but it pays to be dressed for any occasion.<p>
