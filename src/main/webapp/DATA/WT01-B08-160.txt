Dear Whitney Farms-- Can you explain adding minerals and nutrients to soil?  What value does this have?
</P></B><P>
Plants feed themselves by converting the energy contained in sunlight to
forms that can be utilized by life on this planet.  This is a process
known as photosynthesis.  As part of that process plants require certain
nutrients some of which come from the air, some from water, and some
from the soil.  By supplying nutrients to the soil, we are ensuring that
the plants have the elements they require to perform the valuable service
they provide the rest of us who depend on them for food.</P>

<P>A good example is magnesium.  It is at the heart of the chlorophyll
molecule--putting the 'green' in plants--and acts much like the
hemoglobin in our own blood.  Only 20% of the magnesium in plants is
part of chlorophyll, it also is necessary to every operation in a plant
involving phosphorus; it influences the metabolism of nitrogen and is
important to the assimilation of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.
Obviously, it is vital to the well being of plants.  Plants get
magnesium from the soil.</P>

<P>At the same time, it is important to understand that every time we
harvest a vegetable, cut a flower, or feed plants to livestock we are
transferring minerals and nutrients from the soil where the plants grew
to a new location--our bodies, the cows, our dining room table, or even
the garbage.  If we don't replace those nutrients either by composting
or through supplements from fertilizers we could eventually deplete the
natural reserves of available nutrients in the soil, and we would no
longer be able to grow plants.</P>

<P>It is also true that in many soils some nutrients are  deficient or in a
form that is not available to plants.  This is particularly true of
nitrogen.  Nitrogen is very soluble in water and is often deficient in
most soils.  It is also absolutely essential for plant growth.  It can
dramatically limit our abilities to grow plants.  By adding it to our
soils, we ensure that our plants have what they need to grow and thrive.</P>

<P>Ultimately, the value of adding nutrients and minerals to the soil is
that we ensure that our plants grow, that the organisms in the soil
vital to the health and growth of our plants are able to grow and
thrive, and most importantly we ensure that the food we eat is rich and
well balanced and contains the minerals and vitamins we need to live.</P>

<P>It is my belief that without soil and the plants that grow in it, life
as we know it would not exist on this planet.  All the food we eat, all
the gasoline we burn, all the natural gas we cook with is a by-product
of the process of photosynthesis.  Without it, we would cease to exist.
By taking care of our soils and providing them with the nutrients they
require to support the plants and the rest of the life on the planet, we
ensure that we continue to live on this planet.  Without fertile soils
you have deserts where nothing grows and only the toughest species of
organisms can survive--we humans are not that tough!!</P>
<P>Hope I could answer your question...It is not one that lends itself to a
short or simple response...If you still need clarification, please email
again.</P>
<BR>
<H3>What does organic mean?</H3>
<P>There are a variety of definitions on what constitutes "organic." At <B>Whitney Farms</B> our guiding definition of "organic" is any naturally occurring animal and plant by-products approved for use by the major certification organizations like Oregon Tilth and California Certified Organic Farmers.  We only use products that will improve the soil and encourage a healthy population of soil organisms, while meeting the nutritional requirements of your plants.</P>

<H3>Does a plant know the difference between a synthetic/chemical fertilizer and an organic fertilizer?</H3>
<P>All nutrients, whether synthetic or organic must be converted to a form which can be utilized by the plant.  The plant does not recognize a difference between synthetic/ chemical or organic nutrient sources, but the soil does.  Organic fertilizers and amendments are meant to develop a healthy and vital population of the organisms that make nutrients available to plants.  Therein lies the age old organic gardening motto, "Feed the soil, not the plant." A plant's growth is dependent on the ability of the soil to retain and release nutrients.  It is therefore critical that the soil be nurtured and fed.  A healthy soil will result in a garden full of healthy plants.  Our intent is to help the gardener build a fertile soil with a large reserve of nutrients.  The plant will draw the nutrients it needs from this storehouse in the soil.</P>
<H3>What impact does soil temperature have on organic fertilizers?</H3>
<P>Because organic fertilizers work in unison with the microbial life in the soil, most organic fertilizers work more effectively when the ground temperature is above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, which allows those organisms to be active.  Below that ground temperature, the biological processes in the soil may be sluggish and the nutrients are, in a sense, "dormant" in the soil.</P>
<H3>Why are organic fertilizers more expensive than synthetic/chemical fertilizers and yet still considered a better value?</H3>

<P>Organic fertilizers are more expensive than synthetic/chemical fertilizers because the raw materials cost considerably more.  In most cases, however, organic fertilizers are a better value because they don't have to be used as often, and will have the long term benefit of improving the soil.  Organic fertilizers may be more expensive, but they will improve the ability of the soil to retain and release nutrients that will reduce a garden's overall fertilizer needs.</P>

<H3>How often should organics be applied?</H3>

<P>How frequently you apply fertilizers will depend largely on the inherent fertility of the garden soil.  A very poor soil may require regular applications of nutrients and soil amendments as it is being built-up.  Rich, healthy soil only requires applications of nutrients to replace those that are removed by the plants or lost by natural processes of decay.  Because organic matter is naturally consumed by soil organisms it is advisable to apply compost or other amendments and organic fertilizers at least once a year.</P>

<H3>Don't organics work slower than synthetic/chemical fertilizers?</H3>

<P>Organic fertilizers work gradually, and that is what contributes to their effectiveness.  Because the nutrients are released slowly, the plants are able to use them as they need them, and to grow at a natural rate.  This slow release enhances the inherent ability of plants to resist attacks. from insects and disease, and to survive dramatic extremes of climate, such as drought and unseasonable freezes.</P>

<H3>How important is amending the soil in organic gardening?</H3>

<P>Amending the soil is the foundation of organic gardening.  The whole philosophy is to encourage the growth of those organisms within the soil that govern the availability of nutrients.  By carefully amending the soil through the use of regular applications of organic matter, the physical structure of the soil can be vastly improved.  This will contribute significantly to better moisture retention, nutrient retention, aeration, and drainage.</P>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- Can you recommend a source of Organic fertilizer
that will giver the desired results as per 1000
square feet?</P></B>
<P>
First let me tell you how to determine how much nitrogen is in a given
fertilizer.  You will find three numbers on every label of fertilizer.  The
first is nitrogen (N)--green growth in plants; the second is phosphorous
(P)--flowering, fruiting, and rooting; the third number is potash
(K)--overall health and vigor (these are simple "rules of thumb" but
generally accurate.)  These numbers are a percentage of the weight of the
bag.  So, for example if we had a 100 lb. bag of a 10-10-10 fertilizer, 10%
of 100 lbs. would be the total nitrogen content of the product--10 lbs..
The math is not as neat for P and K, there is a small conversion for the
actual content.  (Hopefully, I didn't just bore you with information you
already knew!)</P>

<P>So, to answer your question, I would suggest blood meal for your nitrogen
source.  Why?  Oregon State University has been looking at organic nitrogen
sources for the last couple of years, and the Professor doing the research
has come to believe that blood meal is the single finest nitrogen source he
has ever seen, bar none--synthetic or organic.  It will release its
nutrients in cold, wet soils or warm, dry soils.  It releases its nutrients
quickly, and yet OSU has seen it continue to feed for up to 8 months or
more.  It is good stuff.</P>

<P>How much to apply?  Given the information above, there are about 2.6 pounds
of N in a 20 lbs. bag of Blood Meal (13% of 20 lbs.).  So that ought to
provide you with what you are looking for.</P>

<P>Be sure to add compost at the same time you till in the fertilizer, if you
are not in the habit of doing so already.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- About how large an area will 1 yard of mulch cover if it is about 2 inches deep.</P></B>
<P>We estimate that it takes about nine cubic feet to cover a hundred
square feet (10 X 10) with one inch of compost.  Given that there are 27
cubic feet in a cubic yard, you should be able to cover about 150 sq.
ft. with a yard of material spread two inches deep.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- what's the last spring frost date in st.paul,mn?</P></B>

<P>Is this a trick question?  Being from Oregon, and central California
before that, I can't honestly say that I know the last frost date for
St. Paul.  Were I to seek out the answer, I would call the agricultural
extension service for the State of Minnesota.  I know that in Montana
the growing season is relatively short--in the 75- to 150-day range, and
that it is possible to have a frost almost any time of the year in some
of the more mountainous areas.  The last frost can be as late as early
June.  Presumably, conditions are similar in Minnesota.</P>

<P>Sorry we could not be of more help, but the question is a little out of
our range--give those extension folks a call though!  We pay taxes so
that we can get information like that from folks like them!</P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- Which of your fertilizers would be best for an outdoor cactus garden?</B></P>
<P>I would recommend our All-Purpose Plant Food for use in cactus gardens.
It is an excellent general purpose fertilizer that has long lasting
ingredients to gently feed your cactus throughout the year.  One or two
applications per year should be sufficient for the needs of most cactus
plants.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- 
What are the major drawbacks to using chemical fertilizers in our garden.  I am especially concerned about any health related problems or
soil contamination. </P></B>
<P>I can not tell you honestly that in and of themselves chemical or
synthetic fertilizers are harmful or inherently evil.  If used
judiciously and intelligently they can make a significant contribution
to the overall health and productivity of our soils.  Unfortunately that
is not how they are use. </P>

<P>Instead, they are viewed as all that is needed to grow plants.  Vitamins
are important to our health, but it would be impossible for us to live
on vitamins alone.  I see synthetic fertilizers in much the same light.
They are only one part of a very complex picture.  Here are the primary
drawbacks I see to there use: </P>

<P>Destruction of soil structure.  Soil is alive and depends on organic
matter to keep it healthy.  Just as we require carbon to live so to do
the organisms in the soil.  Excessive use of synthetic or chemical
fertilizers has several detrimental effects on the soil.  One soil
microbiologist I know has documented the destruction of soil life due to
salt based, synthetic fertilizers.  She says it is a pretty simple
process--you have a salt, with a very low moisture pressure (the
fertilizer) next to bacteria and other organisms critical to the health
and productivity of the soil.  These organisms are basically cells
filled with water.  Water moves from areas of high pressure (the
bacteria) to areas of low pressure (the fertilizer).  The result?  A
whole bunch of dead soil microbes.  This particular biologist has
documented a depletion of soil life on American farmlands from a natural
high of anywhere from 200-2000 species to a low of fewer than 20
species--all due, she believes, to the overapplication of salt based
fertilizers.  (chemical fertilizers are by definition salt based)
Furthermore, many of the less expensive forms of these products utilize
sources or raw materials that are very high in chloride, also toxic to
microbial life. </P>

<P>So what's the big deal?  Dead bacteria who cares?  Most people do not
realize that all the nutrients plants need are cycled at one time or
another by the biology in the soil.  In fact, most forms of synthetic
nitrogen are made available by microbes in the soil.  Without the
microbes the soil is dead and unproductive. </P>

<P>Furthermore, the microbial life in the soil makes a significant
contribution to the structure of the soil which determines how easy it
is to work, to the prevention and destruction of pests and diseases (In
fact, penicillin is a derived from soil microbes!), to the overall growth
of plants in the soil. </P>

<P>At the same time, due to the excessive use of synthetic nitrogen, soil
systems can be affected in several other ways.  For example, if there is
always an overabundance of soluble nitrogen, many of the microbial
systems slow down--why work if we don't need to.  Then when the plants
need the nitrogen to be converted to a more available form the
biological system that makes that happen is not working at optimum
efficiency.  At the same time, because there is a balance of carbon and
nitrogen in the soil, a lot of soluble nitrogen floating around can lead
to the destruction of soil organic matter which ultimately leads to loss
of soil structure and productivity.  This can lead to catastrophic
events like the dust bowl in the early part of this century, or erosion
at levels far beyond what the soil can naturally replace. </P>

<P>Many chemical fertilizers are acidifying which can cause problems in
areas where soils are already acid.  Many nutrients are made less
available due to high acidity (low pH), which results in plants not
being able to use them and suffering from nutrient deficiencies. </P>

<P>Soluble forms of nitrogen are also readily leached out of the soil often
causing ground water contamination due to excessive nitrate
concentrations.  Nitrates are toxic to mammals and extremely harmful to
babies etc.  I have seen some work indicating a relationship between
miscarriage and high nitrate levels in farm well water.  At the same
time, in places like the Everglades extremely high levels of phosphorous
due to the excessive use of phosphate fertilizers has caused severe
environmental damage.  Furthermore, many lakes and streams in this
country are clogged with algal blooms directly related to the misuse and
over dependence on synthetic nitrogen on agricultural lands. </P>

<P>There is a good body of evidence to show that the salts can build up in
the soil also leading to a loss of productivity.  The deserts of Irag
and Iran are known to anthropologists and historians as the Fertile
Crescent and may be the first example of highly centralized, irrigated
agriculture.  Many scientists believe that these practices lead directly
to the desertification of the region and the current state of the land
there. </P>

<P>More?  Ironically, many soil scientists estimate that only a very small
percentage of the chemical fertilizers applied actually find there way
into the plants.  Some estimates are as low as 10-20%.  The rest is tied
up in the organic matter of the soil, where it is released to plants in
subsequent seasons, or it is leached out into the water supply, or lost
to the atmosphere as a gas. </P>

<P>Gardeners become dependent on the fertilizers and fail to understand
what is happening in the soil.  They stop adding organic matter or
compost, and the soil becomes less and less productive.  So they add
more and more fertilizer and the soil becomes less and less productive.
Soil is alive and you have to feed that life to keep it productive.
Inert salts do not feed the soil. </P>

<P>In fact, in reality they do not even feed the plants. Sunlight and the
photosynthetic process feeds plants (and the rest of us too!), the
nutrients in the soil, air and water are only the building blocks that
make that process possible.  Feed the soil, not the plants! </P>

<P>What else?  It is very easy to make a severe mistake with highly
concentrated salt based, synthetic fertilizers.  An obvious example is
salt burn.  Too much fertilizer salts and the plants burn.  Other
problems can be more subtle.  It does not take a lot of some of the
trace minerals to cause some very severe nutritional deficiencies in the
plants.  Often synthetic blends have these trace mineral packages in
them that are supposed to be just dandy--but no one knows how much of
these substances you already have present in your soil.  People just
apply them because the box told them too, and yet they could be building
up a toxic level of a trace mineral without even realizing it. </P>

<P>Synthetic fertilizers contribute to our dependency on foreign oil.  It
takes energy to make them and some are even made using by products of
oil. </P>

<P>Synthetic fertilizers can also cause over abundant growth in plants.
This can make plants weak, subject to falling over when exposed to the
least wind or the most gentle spring rain.  That overly lush growth can
also be attractive to insect pests and subject to diseases.  It is also
typically very water intensive--all that growth makes a plant a lot less
drought resistant. </P>

<P>There is some evidence that produce grown with soluble salt based
fertilizers is also less nutritious than that grown using natural
organic methods.  There is a fairly large body of research comparing the
dry weight of produce--the crops grown using chemical fertilizers are
full of water, and have a lower mineral content than that using organic
methods. </P>

<P>These are a few of the concerns that I have with the long term use of
chemical fertilizers.  I hope I answered some of your questions.  Our
Web page (as you probably already know) has some more info which may
also answer some of your concerns.  I would also invite you to visit a
"friend's" web page.  Check out www.cfarms.com (if that doesn't work try
cfarm.com without the ess).  They have a great, albeit long, piece about
why organic covering many of these topics and more. </P>

<P>And we haven't even begun to discuss pesticides...</P>
