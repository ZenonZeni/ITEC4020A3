<B><I> My school system is planning to develop a gifted program.  What resources
are available?

</B></I><P>The first step in planning a program for gifted students is to
contact your State Department of Education and
speak with the person responsible for gifted education.  Find out if your
state has written material on state policies or regulations that affect
education for students who are gifted.<P>

In program planning, there are many issues to be considered.  One primary 
issue is curriculum--deciding what students should know, matched with the 
characteristics and ability of the students.  Most instructional models are insufficient to 
address this issue because they must be massaged into lock-step time 
constraints. Therefore, many schools use a combination of models that provide 
structure, and then look closely at their own  curriculum.  Selected curriculum resources
are enclosed in this document.<P>

  This curriculum framework provides a model for developing appropriate and 
meaningful language arts curricula for high ability learners in kindergarten 
through grade 8. It is intended as a guide to making decisions about 
traditional curricular emphases within the language arts areas of reading, 
writing, speaking, and listening, as well as nontraditional areas like 
thinking, multiculturalism, and technology.  The curriculum development guide 
discusses: issues in developing learner outcomes; current language arts 
learning objectives specified by state guides; learner outcomes in the concept, 
content, and process dimensions; and interdisciplinary applications through 
project work.  Four goals are presented, each accompanied by learner outcomes 
and archetypal activities for high ability students in language arts.  The 
goals include: to develop analytical and interpretative skills in literature, 
to develop persuasive writing skills, to develop linguistic competency, and to 
develop listening/oral communication skills.  Several performance assessment 
protocols for language arts are provided.  An annotated list of 37 exemplary 
resources for teaching language arts to high ability learners concludes the 
guide.  (JDD)<BR>

  This concept paper outlines the rationale for a project on the development of 
science curriculum for K-8 high ability learners.  The rationale was developed 
through a synthesis of major recommendations from national science reform 
reports and from a review of the literature on effective science curriculum for 
high ability learners.  The paper begins with a summary of the background 
research, with emphasis on six key curriculum components: (1) developing an 
understanding of scientific concepts; (2) developing scientific inquiry skills; 
(3) developing a knowledge base in science areas; (4) developing 
interdisciplinary connections; (5) developing problem-based learning 
approaches; and (6) developing scientific habits of mind.  Then major project 
objectives are outlined.  These include: review of promising science curriculum 
materials for high ability learners; development of papers on key science 
concepts; development of a curriculum scope and sequence model; conducting a 
summer institute on teaching science to gifted learners; development of a set 
of exemplary science curriculum units; field testing of newly developed 
curriculum; and generation of scholarly publications.  A glossary defines key 
terms and an appendix provides a synthesis of science report recommendations.

  This paper contains findings of a study that investigated the extent to which 
three schools nationally recognized for their change efforts could provide 
evidence of systemic change.  The conceptual framework was developed from the 
following sources: (1) the effective-schools movement; (2) structural reform; 
(3) the middle-school movement; (4) curriculum, instruction, and assessment 
reform efforts; and (5) the literature on special-needs populations.  Data were 
obtained from interviews with the principals, school district personnel, 
teachers, students, and parents; classroom observation; and document analysis.  
Findings indicate that structural change efforts received the most focus in the 
three schools.  Despite engagement with the authentic-assessment movement, 
there was little change in curriculum and assessment practices.  Finally, the 
schools clearly communicated their visions.  A conclusion is that changing a 
school's philosophy and/or mission is only one step toward systemic change.  
Until change moves from the school-level structural arena to the classroom-level 
arena of curriculum and instruction, reform will continue to be piecemeal 
rather than systemic.  One figure and a copy of the interview protocol are 
included.  (LMI)<BR>

  This paper looks at broad trends in education of the gifted and identifies 
elements that states should review and reconsider in terms of the current 
climate for educational reform.  The 1972 Marland report is contrasted with the 
1993 report of the U.S.  Department of Education titled "National Excellence: A 
Case for Developing America's Talent;" Marland's exclusive focus on the 
education of the gifted and talented versus the later report's emphasis on 
excellence for all students is noted.  This paper then identifies the following 
specific areas for state policy review, based on a review of documents from 49 
states: (1) philosophy and rationale; (2) mandated services; (3) definitions of 
the gifted; (4) identification procedures; (5) programs for the gifted; and (6) 
differentiated curriculum and instruction.  States are urged to accept the 
challenge offered by the "National Excellence" Report, reevaluate their 
policies, and consider changes recommended in this paper.  (DB)<BR>

  This paper introduces the Learning Outcomes Study at the University of 
Virginia, an ongoing 2-year investigation of over 1,000 elementary school 
children who entered one of 16 different gifted programs (or no program) in the 
fall of 1990.  The study will compare effects of four examples each of four 
types of program delivery arrangements: (1) within-classroom (or mainstream 
type); (2) pull-out programs; (3) separate classes or ability tracking; (4) and 
special schools.  Special comparisons will be made of program effects on 
minority and disadvantaged students.  Information will also be collected on 
each program's curriculum, teaching methods and goals, as well as the 
background and training of program teachers, and student identification 
criteria.  Students will be assessed four times: at the time of entry into a 
formal gifted program, at the end of their first year in the program, and at 
the beginning and end of their second year.  Multiple outcome measures will 
assess student achievement, attitudes, and adjustment.  Additional questions 
possibly examined include the relationship between self-concept and intrinsic 
motivation; whether these two concepts have a differential impact on 
achievement; and the behavioral adjustment of high achieving students.  (18

  This textbook focuses on the development and education of talented children 
and adults.  Part 1 considers who the gifted and talented are, in terms of 
personality aspects, intellectual competence, and specific talent in a domain.  
It presents a pyramidal framework of talent based on looking at adult talent 
and its precursors in childhood behavior.  Chapters in Part 1 are: "Who Are the 
Talented? Giftedness, Talent, Genius, and Intelligence"; "Getting Started: 
Developing a Program for Talented Youth"; "Identifying the Academically 
Talented: Superior Cognitive Talent and Specific Academic Talent"; "Creativity 
and Talent"; and "Identifying Creativity and Talent Behaviors." Part 2 
considers the paths of talent development, from birth to adult in three 
chapters.  Part 3 considers what one does with talented children, in curriculum 
and counseling.  Part 3 chapters are: "Precepts for Curriculum for the 
Academically Talented," "Curriculum Practices: In and Out of the Classroom," 
"Guidance and Counseling Needs of the Talented," and "At-Risk Talented 
Children." The text emphasizes guidance aspects of dealing with talented 
children more than therapeutic approaches.  Each chapter begins with focusing 
questions.  Several case examples are offered of talented individuals, programs 
serving the gifted, and techniques for teaching gifted and talented individuals.
Appendices contain a gifted/talented data gathering questionnaire and the text 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  (Contains approximately 850 
references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This digest, in question and answer format, summarizes what is known about 
effective ways to provide fully educational services for gifted students in the 
regular classroom.  The following questions are addressed: What are the steps 
to full service? (educators need to plan environments in which all students can 
fully develop their abilities and interests); What are the characteristics of 
students who are gifted and talented? (such students differ in the pace of 
learning, depth of understanding, and interests); What is the role of the 
regular classroom teacher? (teachers should be facilitators with skills in both 
subject areas and learning management); What program options are needed to meet 
the needs of these students? (a multiple programming approach is needed); What 
instructional provisions must be made? (student characteristics should guide 
development of instructional accommodations).  A 14-item list of references and 
suggestions for further reading are included.  (DB)<BR>

  This paper proposes a five-step model intended to meet the needs of gifted 
students in the context of the mixed ability reality that most teachers in 
regular classrooms encounter.  The model consists of five steps each of which 
has several components.  The steps and components are: (1) acceptance 
(initiatives must start out small and sound to be successful, must focus on 
"cans" rather than "can'ts", and must recognize various learning patterns, 
styles, and rates); (2) classroom climate (should be child centered, active, 
open and respectful); (3) knowledge of content objectives (including the course 
of study, the role of textbooks, and a wide variety of resources and 
materials); (4) learning activities (characterized by flexible pacing, both 
acceleration and enrichment options, and use of interdisciplinary theme units); 
and (5) evaluation (use of alternative methods by a variety of individuals to 
evaluate both observable and nonobservable domains).  (DB)<BR>

  Gifted education depends on two linkages in its program development efforts: 
the special education linkage and the general education linkage.  A closer 
working relationship with general education is recommended, along with careful 
consideration of the curriculum reform movement, basic research on teaching and 
learning, and effective schools research.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This handbook is intended to aid in development of educational programs for 
gifted students in New Hampshire.  The handbook is divided into seven sections. 
Section I, provides material regarding the specific policies that authorize and 
pertain to gifted education in New Hampshire and offers resources to assist 
educators in describing the present status of gifted education in their area.  
Section II includes an overview of the nature and goals of gifted education, the 
rationale for gifted education, and the fundamental beliefs upon which the 
handbook's guidelines were established.  Section III examines preparation 
considerations to establish a sound foundation for planning efforts, such as 
setting priorities and gathering and analyzing data.  Section IV examines the 
nature and purposes of the planning process.  It outlines who should be 
involved in planning, reviews planning tasks, and provides a checklist to 
monitor planning progress.  Section V discusses major responsibilities and 
tasks at the district level such as promoting shared decision making and 
creating a master plan.  Section VI addresses the extension of district-level 
criteria to the local school or building level and proposes seven indicators of 
excellence in programming.  Section VII, discusses plan implementation and 
management, evaluation and long-range planning, and communication and school-
community relations.  Appendices include: "Summary of Planning Tasks," 
"References" (over 70); "Parent Handout on Contemporary Programming,"
