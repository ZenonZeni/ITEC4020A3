Dr. Patricia Morrissey<BR>
Staff Director<BR>
Subcommittee on Disability Policy<BR>
422 Dirksen Senate Office Building<BR>
Washington, DC 20510<P>
Dear Dr. Morrissey:<P>
We have completed our initial review of the committee staff draft documents prepared for the pending reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  We congratulate the staff for having developed an excellent policy document, bold in  its attention to future policy directions and thoughtful in its attention to the primary matters at issue in this important reauthorization.  CEC is pleased to endorse both the general directions and the basic content of this draft as a solid and dependable vehicle for consideration of all reauthorization issues.<P>
CEC is pleased that a proper balance has been struck in the draft between a continuing commitment to the basic foundations of the IDEA and an effort to facilitate emerging directions in American education as they relate to children with disabilities, i.e. school reform, in-state partnerships, and coordinated service systems.<P>
However, as may be readily observed in our attached comments, there are a number of changes, refinements, and clarifications which CEC recommends to the Senate committee.  Given the openness of Senate staff throughout the process, which we appreciate, the Council knows that these remaining matters at issue in this reauthorization will be addressed in a manner which will benefit children with disabilities, their families, and the persons who serve them.<P>
Sincerely, <P>
<BR>
<BR>
Nancy D. Safer<BR>
Interim Executive Director<P>

<CENTER><B>Comments on the Senate Draft Bill on the<BR>
Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<B><U>UNDER PART A:</B></U><P>
<B>Findings</B>.  CEC commends the Senate for the positive statements on special education in the findings section of the draft bill.  We also believe including statements regarding the constitutional basis for IDEA is a worthy initiative.<P>
<B>Definitions.</B>   We support the Senate's decision not to add additional categories to the 13 eligibility categories already listed under IDEA.  We urge the Subcommittee, however, to adopt the Administration's proposal for changing the term "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."  The term "serious" is pejorative and unnecessary.   Finally, we recommend the Senate allow States the option of using the term "developmental delay" for ages 3 through 8 to allow children with disabilities to be served in the primary grades without the need for the designation of a diagnostic category.  We believe that this option would allow services to those children who clearly are eligible for special education but for whom it is difficult to pinpoint the specific disability at an early age.<P>
<B>Administrative Provisions</B>.  We are unclear as to the intent of the limitation of the use of funds in Sec. 610(c)(3).  We are also concerned that the Subcommittee would authorize only standing panels to review grant applications.  While CEC affirms the potential value of standing panels for some uses, only authorizing standing committees may not be practical given the number and range of applications received by the U.S. Department of Education.  Some flexibility may be needed in the review process.<P>
CEC is concerned that Sec. 610(e)(D) seems to allow authority for grants under Part D and E for activities addressing the needs of low-achieving students, underserved populations, children from low-income families, children with limited-English proficiency and unserved and underserved areas.  While we agree that projects in these areas are important, we oppose using scarce resources available under Parts D and E for populations other than the originally intended population, namely children with disabilities.<P>
<B><U>UNDER PART B:</B></U><P>
<B>Federal Commitment to Children with Disabilities</B>.  CEC commends the Senate for retaining language specifying the federal financial commitment to children with disabilities.  Even though the Federal government has never met its commitment to provide States 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for every child with a disability, it is extremely important to work towards this goal.  By keeping the commitment language, the Senate reaffirms the basic IDEA partnership between States and the Federal government.<P>
<B>Formula to States. </B> CEC supports the retention of the current formula for State grants.   A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds States receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  We also believe that a formula change may penalize States which have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.  <P>
<B>State Activities.  </B>CEC supports the Senate draft's retention of language allowing States to use 25 percent of funds  for State level activities.  States use these IDEA funds for statewide activities that continuously improve the State's capacity to meet the educational needs of  children with disabilities by providing inservice training, responding to concerns identified in federal monitoring, and in providing direct and support services to children.  <P>
<B>CSPD.  </B>CEC is pleased that the Senate draft would retain the requirement that each State maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development.  CEC remains concerned, however, that any personnel development plan be developed and promoted through a process that promotes linkages in each State among all involved State agencies, institutions and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  CEC observes that the concept of in-State partnerships is a major feature of the new proposed Part C of the Senate draft, and we applaud the inclusion of that feature.  We look forward to continuing discussion of how that concept may be specifically applied to the CSPD, and will continue to encourage a Professional Development Coordinating Council (PDCC) charged with the specific task of developing and implementing the in-State CSPD.<P>
<B>Personnel Standards</B>.  We note and approve the retention of the current statute respecting personnel standards commencing on page 22 of the draft.  We continue to urge, as portrayed in our formal testimony,  the inclusion of three important modifications with respect to the "highest requirement" provisions.<P>
We believe that the statute must specifically assign responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the State education agency. Further, we believe that the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is vital and would use the term "professional standards" throughout this section.<P>
Finally, we recommend inclusion of the following language in the statute:  "Establishment and Use of Levels of Personnel Within Disciplines.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, nothing prohibits the establishment and use by the State education agency of different levels of personnel, including paraprofessionals, within specific occupations or disciplines if the State also specifies appropriate roles and responsibilities, training, and direct and indirect supervision by certified professionals for each level."<P>
<B>Prohibition on Commingling Funds and Waiver on Supplanting of Funds.</B>   CEC supports the Senate draft's retention of the prohibition on commingling of IDEA funds with other funds.  IDEA funds are meant to provide services to children with disabilities and should continue to be for that purpose only.  We also support the current language, retained by the Senate, on supplanting of funds.  With limited federal funds supporting services to children with disabilities now, CEC believes allowing IDEA funds to be supplanted or commingled would leave funds for services for children with disabilities extremely vulnerable.  CEC strongly urges the Subcommittee to restore these prohibitions. <P>
<B>Allowing a Reduction in Expenditures for LEA.  </B>CEC recognizes the circumstances behind provisions in Sec. 612(a)(3)(E) allowing for an LEA to reduce its level of expenditures if there is a departure from the LEA's system of particular students with higher service needs, or there are one-time expenditures by the LEA in the preceding fiscal year, as legitimate reduction of special education expenditures and therefore, concur with these exceptions.  We have concerns, however, with exception (I) which could be used to justify replacing experienced, qualified staff with lesser qualified personnel simply to reduce costs and we oppose this exception as written.<P>
<B>Coordinated System.  </B>While we believe that the coordinated service system authorized in Sec. 612(f) is desirable, it is unclear how costs will be shared among programs.  The amendment seems to allow LEAs the ability to use IDEA funds to develop and implement a coordinated services system to improve results for children and families without requiring either funds from other sources or provisions that the IDEA funds used are proportionate to the number of children with disabilities likely to be served.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Incidental Benefit.</B>  CEC strongly supports the progressive language in the Subcommittee's draft bill in Sec. 613(a)(4) that allows local funds to be provided to a child with a disability in a regular class, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services, or children covered under ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.   These common sense provisions will go a long way in allowing teachers and related services personnel to provide services to IDEA eligible children without regard to the incidental benefit to other children. <P>
<B>School-based Improvement Plan</B>.  CEC observes the section providing for a school-based improvement plan which is focused on specific schools, seeks to improve the educational and transitional results for children with disabilities, and is linked to authorized activities under the new Part C.<P>
CEC has no quarrel with the worthy objective, but has some questions.  Would these authorized arrangements allow waivers or modifications of any of the provisions of Parts A and B, such as any rights guarantees or provisions prohibiting supplanting and commingling of funds?  Would this section allow more than one school in a district to participate, and, correspondingly, could all schools in a district participate?  Would the establishment of such arrangements encourage a concentration of Part B funds on the particular school(s) in question?  Finally, what precisely is being authorized that school districts and their schools cannot do now?<P>
<B>Re-evaluation</B>.  Among the many features of the Senate draft which CEC strongly supports is the stipulation that re- evaluations occur every 3 years <U>or</U> at key transition junctures in the educational process, for instance at the time of transition from elementary school to middle or junior high school. This stipulation coupled with provisions related to situations in which additional data is not needed will promote far more useful and appropriate re-evaluations.<P>
<B>Individual Education Program.  </B>CEC reaffirms its support for the Subcommittee's efforts to clarify IEP language in meeting the child's needs in relation to the general curriculum and for the overall refinements made in the IEP section.<P>
<B>Discipline.  </B>CEC looks forward to reviewing the Subcommittee's language regarding any changes in the discipline of children with disabilities.  CEC believes that alternative procedures should be authorized for an immediate threat to classroom safety.  We strongly believe, however, that no child should be permanently expelled and that children with disabilities and who are suspended should continue to receive FAPE.  <P>
<B>Parental Notice. </B> While CEC supports the Subcommittee's attempt to clarify the content of parental notices, we are very concerned that the provisions of Sec. 615(c) will result in more paperwork for schools and will continue to result in parents being overwhelmed by the length and amount of technical information included in the basic notice.  CEC believes that the House Committee's second draft provides a framework that guarantees parents necessary information but does not require the entire packet of information to be sent every time the parents are notified of a change.    <P>
<B>Notification of School of Intention to File a Complaint.</B>   CEC supports the Subcommittee's language requiring parents to notify the school of their intention to file a complaint at least 10 days prior to the date of filing if parents have new information or if the LEA is unaware of the nature of the complaint.  We believe this provision will assist schools and parents in working together to solve problems before the need for litigation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mediation.  </B>CEC supports the Subcommittee's provisions that would require SEAs to provide mediation as an option to parents.  However, while CEC affirms the need for parents to have the support they need for mediation and a role in structuring the mediation, we are concerned that the process as structured does not result in an adversarial process as sometimes results in the current due process procedures.  We prefer the House Committee's draft language in this section.  <P>
<B>Policy/Regulations</B>.   CEC supports the subcommittee's inclusion of language that would prohibit the Secretary from establishing a new rule without following the public comment and review requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.  We also support the requirement that the Secretary publish in the Federal Register a list of correspondence from the Department of Education and include a description of the interpretation of the Department.  The Subcommittee may want to clarify that this requirement only applies to new issues that are addressed by the Department.<P>
<B>Preschool Program.</B>  CEC supports the retention of the current formula for the Preschool program and commends the Subcommittee for its long standing commitment to the program.  We are concerned, however, that the coordination language does not have the 1 percent cap that is included for State-level coordination activities under the larger Part B program.  CEC urges the Subcommittee to institute a similar cap.<P>
<B>Support Programs</B>.  CEC wishes to acknowledge, with appreciation, the manner in which the Senate provides a sound basic framework for the vital support programs of IDEA as presented in the draft primarily under Parts C, D, and E. While the number of appropriation line-items would be reduced, major, proven components of the existing support programs would be retained with the overall proposed funding level constant in relation to the current level of fiscal support.  Further, the support programs would continue to be administered at the federal level, as CEC has urged, since they comprise appropriate national activities, and require national direction, coordination, and dissemination. Finally, though this consolidation differs in some respects from that proposed by CEC, the differences are generally at the margins.<P>
However, CEC believes that guaranteed floors and earmarks need to be included by the Senate for particular priority areas, and CEC will continue to urge the Senate to address this issue. We base this recommendation on CEC's criteria for any consolidation which we previously shared with you.  Included among those criteria were the following: Prioritized need areas represented by the current statutory authorities, where important needs must still be met, should be maintained.  Programs with demonstrated effectiveness as they are currently structured should not be restructured simply because change is the fashion of the moment.  And, the worthy objective of greater flexibility in addressing immediate and emerging needs should not take precedent over the obligation to earmark resources for populations and activities that would otherwise be neglected.<P>
We believe that a number of programs fit these criteria, examples being the authorities under the current Part C for early childhood, children with severe disabilities, children with deaf blindness, and children and youth with serious emotional disturbance.<P>
Further, the current approach in the draft directing that the Secretary <U>may</U> direct funds into critical areas should be changed to <U>shall</U>.  CEC understands that instances occur where <U>may</U> is the appropriate approach, but we must guard against giving near total flexibility to the department respecting annual allocations and leaving too many unknowns in the annual agency budget process.  Many of the functions covered through the support authorities are critical services, and the disruption caused by on-again, off-again funding would be significant.<P>
CEC looks forward to working with the Senate Subcommittee on these and other remaining issues respecting the support programs.<P>
<B>Indexing of the Support Programs</B>.   CEC observes that precedents are now in place which affirm the principle of indexing support activities within both Part B and Part H.  Specifically, page 92 of the Senate Part B draft with respect to studies and evaluations and Page l5 of the Senate Part H draft with respect to the FICC include indexed functions.<P>
CEC believes that the time has come to index all of the IDEA support programs within Parts B and H of the Act.  We know that this is a controversial proposal in some quarters.  However, we have witnessed this year how severely these programs can be threatened in actual appropriations, which threat has precipitated a forceful national reaffirmation of the vital importance of these support functions.  These support programs are the infrastructure of the IDEA, breathing life into the quality of programs for children with disabilities.<P>
It goes without saying that funding for the Part B and H programs which provide direct services are critical.  However, to deliver these services effectively we equally need trained professionals, research, innovation and development, technology, nationwide technical assistance, and on-going information sharing.  We are reminded again that the support programs are integral to the functions of Parts B and H, and should be so designated in future budget deliberations of the Congress.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>UNDER PART H:<P>
Early Intervention.  </B>CEC endorses the recommendations made by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Early Childhood Workgroup.<B> </B> In addition, we question the need for the amendment to Section 679 on the uses of funds.  It is our understanding that the use of Part H funds for child identification, evaluation, and referral is already an allowable use of funds and that, in fact, many States so use their funds for this purpose.  If there is confusion about this issue, it should be clarified in report language, not the statute.  The proposed language may actually serve to limit the intended uses of funds, since it refers only to States not serving at-risk children.  A number of States serving at-risk children have narrowly defined the eligible population.  The proposed language might be interpreted as prohibiting them from using funds to evaluate and refer other at-risk children.
