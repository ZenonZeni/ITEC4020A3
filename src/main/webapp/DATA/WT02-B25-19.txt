<p>

It's not often that something Internet-related comes in a small black box requiring no configuration, but Digital Secured
Network Technology Inc. offers just such a product. 
<p>
The NetFortress encryption product is a great alternative for those who want to send confidential information over the Internet
instead of using a more costly private network. 
<p>
I greatly appreciated the NetFortress' lack of complexity. I simply plugged in one of the units in front of the router on each side
of an Internet connection, and the system worked flawlessly. 
<p>
The NetFortress works by encrypting everything at the network layer with a unique key so that the outside world can read only
the source and destination IP address. The data inside the packet -- even which TCP/IP port the packet is bound for -- is
effectively turned into gibberish until the packet arrives at its destination. 
<p>
Using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, NetFortress units can be set up at multiple sites to establish a true WAN using
the Internet. 
<p>
The company burns a unique private key into the boxes when you buy them so that they can communicate only with one
another; therefore, NetFortress units owned by different companies can't decrypt each other's traffic. 
<p>
(You also can get NetFortress boxes configured to either allow or deny traffic that is going to locations without a corresponding
NetFortress.) 
<p>
The boxes generate new public and private keys every 24 hours. 
<p>
When you initially turn on the box, the NetFortress burns the IP address of the machine it's attached to into flash ROM,
rendering the box incapable of working with a machine with any other address. 
<p>
A LAN version of the same box burns the class C address, and the two address types can be mixed together so that a smaller
remote office can use the single-IP NetFortress while the main office uses the LAN version. 
<p>
I examined the packets traveling between two locations using Novell Inc.'s LANalyzer 3.0. Predictably, I could easily decipher
packets captured before installing the NetFortress, and plain-text passwords for Telnet and FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
sessions abounded. 
<p>
After installing the NetFortress, however, I couldn't even tell which service a given packet was from -- everything but the
packet header itself was rendered undecipherable as it traversed the Internet. 
<p>
One downside to the NetFortress is the way it irreversibly burns some information into its flash ROM. Better hope your
network numbers don't change and that you never want to move your NetFortress to another location, because a NetFortress
won't work on any network except the one on which it was first brought up. 
<p>
You can return the box to the company or your reseller and have it reset, but this feature seems a bit heavy-handed. It doesn't
protect against anything other than physical theft of the box, in which case most accomplished technology thieves also would
have made off with the server. At the very least, the network administrator would have the burnt-in private keys for
corresponding units reset.

THE BOTTOM LINE: VERY GOOD 
<p>
NetFortress 
<p>
This little black box offers serious security for those who want to send confidential data using the Internet as a wide area
network. 
<p>
Pros: Easy setup; extreme security.
<br>
Cons: Complicated to reconfigure once set up.
