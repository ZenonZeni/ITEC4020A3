 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS </H2>

<P>   Many biological functions are rhythmic such as the short rhythms of breathing and heartbeat. Longer patterns are common, such as monthly menstrual cycles and annual seasonal cycles.  Daily rhythms are called circadian, from circa" meaning about, and "dies" meaning day. The daily rise and fall of blood pressure, excretions and changes in body temperature are known, but the most common is the melatonin induced sleep/wake cycle. By changing the length of time we are exposed to varying intensities of light during a day, it is possible to affect the timing of melatonin production and disrupt our sleep patterns. This can be experienced with jet travel.  As we traverse several time zones, our production of melatonin gets out of sync with the new time causing jet lag. Also, if one's job requires them to work different shifts, it can take days to get used to the new time resulting in feeling tired most of the time. Understanding circadian rhythms can be meaningful. Vitality is lowest at midnight. For example, death after surgery occurs three times as frequently at midnight than noon. Benefits of taking medications and supplements can be maximized taking these cycles into account. Biological clocks are known to become disorganized in diseased states. This lack of synchronization may not be a mere symptom but part of the disease itself.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PINEAL GLAND</H2>
<P>   The pineal gland is located in the brain and serves as a "light detector" or "third eye."   Light sets the timing mechanism of the brain's internal clock each morning as it enters the lens of the eye and stimulates the retina. Impulses are sent to the hypothalamus and transmitted along the optic nerve and into the sympathetic nervous system and the pineal gland. These impulses inhibit the activity of an enzyme required to produce melatonin, so melatonin production decreases. Then, each night the "clock" signals the pineal gland to secrete the sleep producing hormone melatonin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SLEEP</H2>
<P>  Lowered levels of nighttime melatonin reduce the quality of sleep resulting in the need for more sleep. If your pineal gland does not produce adequate melatonin early enough in the evening, it is difficult to go to sleep. If secretion does not continue, you may wake up too soon. If your pineal gland secretes too much or for too long into the next day, you will have a tendency to be sleepy and not rested the next morning. Continuing melatonin production into the day can also result in depression and tiredness. If you do not get adequate sleep, mental acuity decreases, too. Insomnia exists when melatonin levels are low or when it is produced at the wrong time. Supplementing can help re-establish balance and help you set your biological clock.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENDOCRINE & IMMUNE SYSTEMS</H2>
<P>   There is a close correlation between the pineal and the pituitary/adrenal endocrine glands. Low melatonin levels are associated with lessened thymus activity, steroids metabolism and depression. Much of the activity of the immune system takes place at night and it is thought that melatonin interacts 
with our immune system during sleep. Melatonin may be an anti-stress factor and its normal rhythmic release is a buffering device, quenching the adverse effects of stress on the immune system. Some researchers believe the steady increase in the incidence of cancer is partially because of the extended time we are exposed to artificial lighting. This results in extended hours each day that melatonin production is suppressed when levels would have been higher longer. Melatonin levels of breast and prostate patients are reduced to half the normal levels.  Conditions associated with elevated estrogen levels such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and premenstrual syndrome may be prevented by normal systemic levels of melatonin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BRAIN & CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</H2>
<P>   Melatonin stabilizes electrical activity of the central nervous system. The pineal, primarily through melatonin, acts as a synchronizing and stabilizing organ. Nighttime melatonin levels are low in people with major depressive and panic disorders.  Individuals with noticeable mood swings or melancholy also have depressed melatonin levels.  Both seasonal  affective  disorders  and  non-seasonal  cyclic depressions are related to the peaks and valleys of melatonin levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING</H2>
<P>  Stress and/or dietary lack of tryptophan may make deficiencies of melatonin common. Older individuals have a reduced ability to produce melatonin. The relationships of endocrine rhythms, mood, sleep and the biological effects of light are complex. Since melatonin secretion declines with age, many researchers believe that it may help prevent age-related and free radical mediated brain damage. The melatonin corticoid  relationship  has  significance  since  chronic hypercortisolemia has been associated with age related deterioration of the brain (including Alzheimer's disease), glucose intolerance, atherosclerosis, impaired immune function and cancer. Melatonin appears to mediate the entire aging process.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE </H2>
<P>SOMNISET is formulated in the proprietary Life PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty   natural   concentrates   of  numerous   valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products. you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
 <P>  The recommended range is from one to five tablets from about  thirty to forty-five minutes before  bedtime. SOMNISET is not a drug but a natural supplement supportive of natural metabolic rhythms, so several days supplementation may be needed to begin seeing results. Start with one or two tablets and increase as needed after three nights. More is not necessarily better if not needed.</P>
