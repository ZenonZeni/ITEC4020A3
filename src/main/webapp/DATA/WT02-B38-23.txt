Trade Secrets vs. Freedom of Movement


People's willingness to change jobs for greener pastures is headhunters' stock
in trade, so the recent spread of non-compete and confidentiality agreements
for card professionals is cause for their concern.

"I can understand a non-compete agreement for senior executives, but it's
becoming more common for lower-level employees, and you didn't see that a few
years ago," observes Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc.  "It is
even occurring with entry-level jobs, and that is pretty scary."

Providian Corp., Capital One, and AT&T Universal Card Services are the only
major issuers that have gone this route for positions below top portfolio
jobs, but recruiters worry the practice may spread.  "Providian is extremely
litigious, and they have sued a manager two years after he left, and a junior
person was threatened with a suit," says a recruiter who requests anonymity.
She frets those kinds of actions will have a "chilling" effect on job-changing
in the industry.

A Providian spokesperson won't comment on any legal actions taken by the
company, but adds, "We don't require non-compete agreements, and we never
have."  However, all employees are required to sign a confidentiality
agreement as a condition of employment.

Confidentiality and proprietary agreements usually are sufficient to protect a
company's interests, notes Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human
resources at Capital One Financial Corp., but there are some extremely
sensitive areas such as modeling that rate special treatment.  "As competitive
pressure increases, non-compete contracts have the potential to become fairly
common," he says.  "Companies in trouble will make outrageous salary offers to
get trade secrets if they feel they need them for survival."

Card Executives' Platinum Paychecks


In the not-too-distant past, before the shareholder- rights movement began and
corporate directors found themselves staring down the barrel of
multi-million-dollar lawsuits over executive compensation, corporations had a
free hand to reward senior executives as the board saw fit, sometimes in spite
of company performance.  Shareholder militancy and Internal Revenue Service
rule changes have changed all that, and boards of directors go to great pains
to justify the pay they grant to upper management.  Bonuses and long-term
incentive payments are playing a bigger role than ever before, much to the
chagrin of executives at floundering companies.  But for the fortunate few in
America's growth industries, the rewards have never been greater, and few
industries in the 1990s can match the growth record of the credit card
business.

In the coming months, compensation committees will be reviewing 1995
performance and determining how to reward the officers who produced those
results.  If last year is any indication, that will mean hefty paychecks for
credit card executives, both those who manage portfolios and those in related
service companies.

Performance-based pay is resulting in a windfall, as proxy statements make
clear, with many of the industry's top executives clearing more in bonus pay
than base salary.  And bonuses tell only part of the story:  between
restricted stock grants, options, and assorted perks, card bosses find
themselves in a position that Jay Gatsby could appreciate.

And why not?  Industry growth continues apace, and the competition that occurs
at the account level carries over to the executive suite.  If corporations
want to keep dancing with the guy they brought in-and almost all of the top 20
card executives are men-they had better be willing to match or exceed what the
captains of their ships could command elsewhere.

The same reasoning is being applied at second and third levels of management,
and even below.  Pay for performance, skill-based pay, and related
compensation approaches are translating into fatter paychecks for more people.
By the same token, employees at under-performing firms are faced with static
base pay and a bonus cupboard that's fairly bare.

Meanwhile, democracy is coming to card shops in that more employees are
getting bonuses and stock options.  But that also means that many employees
now face new financial risks.

Compensation Pacesetters

To get a measure of the current state of the card industry's paychecks, Credit
Card Management reviewed 1995 proxy statements issued by more than 30 publicly
held card issuers, bank holding companies, and card-related service firms.

Those reports dramatize the increasing importance of bonuses based on
corporate performance.  Last year, a third of the card industry's top
executives received more money in bonuses than base pay; on average, bonuses
equaled 89% of salary.  Two years earlier, only 11% of those officers received
more in bonuses than salaries, and the average bonus was only 60% of base.
Those who successfully enhance shareholder value stand to reap substantial
rewards.

Executives from so-called pure-play card companies dominate the list, in part
because of the enormous growth experienced by firms such as MBNA Corp.  and
First USA Inc., but also because of the nature of proxy statements.  Only the
five highest-paid officers are presented in those reports, and very few credit
card executives number in those ranks at bank holding companies.  Citicorp's
Roberta Arena may direct a $35 billion asset, but unless one's title includes
the word "chairman" at Citi, an individual will not be in that group.  As
executive vice president of bank cards, Arena rates an honorable mention in
Citi's proxy, along with a score of other execs, but that only means her
salary and bonus were somewhere south of $1.7 million in 1994.

Multi-Tiered Rewards

Since taking over American Express Co.  in the wake of 1991's Optima debacle,
Harvey Golub has engineered a noteworthy turnaround at the
travel-and-entertainment card king, refocusing attention on the core business
while tripling net income over 1992's level.  A bonus that's 255% of base pay
vaults Golub to the top of the card pack in terms of 1994 income, and two of
his lieutenants join him on the list of the industry's 10 best-paid
executives.  In contrast, the failure of Golub's predecessor, James D.
Robinson III, to achieve financial objectives in 1992 cost him a substantial
part of his bonus and, ultimately, his job.

Salary and bonus alone ignore substantial additional pay, including long-term
incentive payouts to Golub of $1.8 million in 1994, vesting in restricted
stock grants, and stock options that have boosted his stake in AmEx to 227,162
shares with an option for 752,500 more.

Not far behind was Charles M.  Cawley, whose salary and bonus more than
doubled to $2 million.  Not coincidentally, corporate net income increased
$58.8 million to $266.6 million.  Cawley was rewarded with an additional
$1,025,000 in restricted stock.

Paychecks for card issuers are fatter than their vendor counterparts, with one
exception:  Pat Thomas, chairman of the recently-merged First Financial
Management Corp., stands head and shoulders above the field, with bonuses
accounting for the bulk of his $6.8 million package for 1994.  That's
significantly above the chairman of First Data Corp., the firm that acquired
FFMC, parent of National Bancard Corp.  (NaBanco), Telecheck, Nationwide
Credit, and other payment-industry companies.

Besides its richness, Thomas's deal with FFMC was an anachronism in an era
when the compensation committees of corporate boards set executive wage
packages.  Thomas enjoyed a personal-service contract that stipulated a bonus
of the lesser of 2.5% of corporate income before taxes or the market value of
94,500 shares, with a minimum bonus of $1.8 million.  He also received options
on 500,000 shares, participation in incentive plans, and various perks,
including payment of premiums on $5 million worth of life insurance and
personal use of the corporate jet, a $59,073 value in 1994.

FFMC had 1994 revenues of $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior year and
consistent with a 29% compounded growth record over the previous five years.

Bonuses at Risk

In contrast to Thomas's bonus, Henry C.  Duques, chairman of First Data,
technically received no bonus, but that's deceptive.  Duques's package
reflects a growing management trend toward risk-based rewards for managers.
Some corporations, including Household International, are requiring senior
executives to purchase stock, and others are granting all rewards in the form
of stock and other instruments whose value is determined by company
performance.

In Duques's case, a 1994 performance grant worth $3 million was granted.  Half
of that amount was in the form of options on 372,088 shares at $40.31; in
mid-1995, shares were trading at $63, a nifty $8.4 million gain if the option
was executed.  The other $1.5 million is dependent on First Data's return on
equity in 1995 and 1996.

A similar calculated gamble is being taken by Capital One Financial Corp.'s
top executives, Chief Executive Richard D.  Fairbank and President Nigel W.
Morris.  In September, the two agreed to forego cash bonuses and stock options
until the turn of the century in exchange for a one-time grant of 1.5 million
and 1 million shares, respectively, at $29.19 per share.  Half the option
vests only if the share price reaches $37.50; the balance vests in increments
up to $50.

Their potential $52 million windfall in five years comes at the cost of
generous bonuses in the past.  In 1994, when Capital One was spun off by
Signet Banking Corp., Fairbank netted $8.08 million and Morris $4.35 million
in cash and restricted stock.

Golden Handcuffs

Stock performance is a major factor in most executives' incentive plans.
Typically, a hypothetical investment of $100 in the corporation's stock is
compared over time to a similar investment in a peer group's stock or a
general index.  If target prices are exceeded, the pool of incentive pay goes
up accordingly; if objectives are not reached, some or all of the pool is in
jeopardy.

Earnings per share or net profits often determine to what extent executives'
incentive pool will be funded.  Often, disbursements are in the form of
restricted stock that vests in three to five years.  "It's more of a golden
handcuff than a lucrative element of the compensation package," says Donald M.
Cunningham, principal of Tulsa, Okla., recruitment firm BankSearch Inc.

A 25% gain in stock value in 1994 was sufficient cause for rejoicing by
marketer Ideon Group Inc.'s directors to boost bonuses beyond the maximums set
in 1993.  Maximum incentives of 30% to 120% of base pay had been set from the
manager to the chief-executive level, but the compensation committee was so
pleased with the organizing work for the cobranded PGA Tour Partners card that
it awarded bonuses of 160% of base, and 190% in the case of Chief Executive
Paul G.  Kahn.

Unfortunately for Ideon, the PGA card has not lived up to expectations, and
the firm has had a shaky 1995.  Top management shares the down-side risk,
which was not the case under former Chief Executive Steven J.  Halmos, who
resigned in late 1992, when the stock lost 13% of its value.  Halmos received
$2.65 million in salary and no bonus in 1991 and 1992, but that compensation
approach ended with a 1993 amendment to the federal tax code.  The amendment
restricts the deductibility of compensation over $1 million unless
pre-established performance goals are met.  That's why corporate boards now go
to considerable lengths to justify executive pay in proxy statements.

Top executives who derive all of their compensation from base salary are a
rarity, and the same is becoming true of lower-level managers.  Restricted
stock seldom is part of compensation at the second and third tiers, but stock
options and other perks are beginning to filter down.  Signing bonuses and
generous relocation packages are becoming more prevalent, recruiters report,
particularly for positions with highly valued skill sets.  BankSearch's
Cunningham cites the case of a collections supervisor who received perquisites
with little or no relation to the job.  "An auto came into play even though it
was apparent he was desk-bound," Cunningham recalls.

Comparative Pay Scales

With the vast majority of management jobs in the $50,000 to $150,000 range,
credit card recruiters focus their energies filling those posts.  Wide
disparities exist for comparable positions in different geographic areas and
between banks, but generally managers at the low end are garnering bonuses of
5% to 7% of base, vice presidents and assistant vice presidents typically fall
in the 10% to 15% range, and higher-level executives can realize up to 30% of
base in annual bonuses, recruiters say.

A risk analyst probably will enjoy slightly higher pay by working in a card
program as opposed to mortgage lending, auto loans, or some other area of a
bank, but the main distinction is demand.  While he predicts "tremendous
growth both in terms of the number of jobs and the compensation" for debit
card marketers in the next five years, headhunter George C.  Genel concedes
debit counterparts "are probably paid a little less" than their opposite
numbers in credit.

Even in customer service and collections, "credit card people tend to be paid
better than their retail-banking counterparts because they're recognized as
more crucial to the success of the card business," suggests John D.  Walp, who
recently left CoreStates to become director of compensation and human resource
systems at Advanta Corp.  "Customer-service staffers do double duty because
they also act as salespeople, whereas their counterparts in a branch may only
answer questions."  Collections on unsecured loans also are more sensitive
than an auto loan for which the bank has recourse, Walp adds.

Nonbanks and pure card issuers such as Advanta rate an edge in pay over their
bank counterparts, recruiters indicate.  GE Capital Corp.  is consistently
cited as a leader.  "They want the best people, and they live in an expensive
market (Connecticut)," explains New York recruiter Nancy Griffiths.

Marketers in Demand

With competition heated for new accounts, card marketing specialists are one
of the industry's hottest commodities, with top people almost finding
themselves in a bidding war for their services, Cunningham notes.  Salary
spikes in the 30% range have occurred over the last two years for
product-management and marketing jobs, he says.  One prospect he was wooing
was offered a 25% pay hike to $93,500 in a less-expensive market, but turned
it down, believing an even more attractive offer will soon come his way.

Recruiter Donald D.  Duggan of Westminster, Colo., says that prospect may be
right.  A marketing manager he recently recruited also received a 25% raise, a
$10,000 signing bonus, a guaranteed bonus of $10,000 the first year, and a
relocation package "that will put $4,000 to $5,000 extra in his pocket," says
Duggan.

"The business has gotten more sophisticated, and complexity has made the
second- and third-level managers more valuable," agrees recruiter Judy Collins
of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest.  Ten years ago, she was placing
credit policy and risk managers in $45,000 jobs; today, the same positions
command $70,000 to $80,000.

Equity Positions

Signing bonuses are becoming quite common, according to Genel of Thousand
Oaks, Calif.  "Most companies will purchase the old home of a person who has
to relocate after 60 to 90 days, and perhaps pay the points and fees to close
on the new house," he adds.  "Bonus programs that used to top out at 10% now
are at 12% to 15%, and people are reaching those caps."

The biggest potential bonus is equity in the card portfolio itself.  Companies
like Capital One have a distinct advantage over banks in tendering that bonus
to the rank and file.  Once its initial public offer was complete and its fate
was no longer tied to Signet's, where poor performance in other business lines
could mitigate sterling card results, Capital One had the latitude to reward
risk-taking that boosts the bottom line in a way banks cannot, Dennis H.
Liberson, vice president of human resources, says.  It began last March by
unveiling a stock option plan called OneGrant that extends all the way down to
the mail room.

OneGrant entitles every full-time worker to buy up to 200 shares at the
then-current price of $19.31 per share.  Half the options vest after two years
and the balance in March 1998.  And while many option offers expire in three
to five years, Capital One employees have 10 years to exercise them.

OneGrant "whetted associates' appetite" for the employee stock-purchase plan
that came next, according to Liberson.  All staff members can now designate up
to a 15% payroll deduction for the purchase of Capital One stock at 15% below
the market price.  By year-end, participation had climbed to more than 800
employees, almost a quarter of the work force.

At one point last year, employees had realized paper profits of about $2,000
apiece on their options.  A subsequent price dip all but wiped out that gain.
Management recognizes the need to balance the goal of building an
entrepreneurial spirit with the demoralizing effect plummeting stock prices
can have, particularly on young staffers inexperienced in the ways of the
market.  "We knew a correction would come, but that long-term we could drive
stock appreciation," Liberson says.  That's why the company limited the amount
that employees could invest, even in the case of middle- and upper-level
managers.

Non-Financial Goals

A third program dubbed Entrepreneur Grant rolled out in September.  The 50 top
managers, excluding Morris and Fairbank, could swap up to 25% of their base
pay and bonuses over the next three years in exchange for stock options; 43
took advantage of the offer and eventually will own about 286,000 shares.

Participation was unanimous at the senior level, Liberson reports, though some
managers with less disposable income elected not to enroll (the program
included managers in the $50,000 to $60,000 range).  "A mandatory stock-option
approach would not work very well because it could create financial stress for
some associates," Liberson explains.  Likewise, granting restricted stock to
executives would not motivate them as much to drive up stock prices as an
option plan in which their own cash is at risk.

Bonuses can be paid to virtually every AT&T Universal Card Services Corp.
employee, though they have less to do with financial performance than how well
customer service is delivered.  "We can measure 100 different processes daily,
from telephone response time to the accuracy of invoices, and every
measurement has a defect standard," says Ira S.  Walter, UCS's director of
human resources development.  A bonus is paid quarterly based on the number of
days the standard was met; bonuses typically are in the 8% to 10% range for
customer-service operators.

Financial performance comes into play in management ranks, but even there
customer service impacts pocketbooks.  "Every single employee, including the
CEO, has an element of their bonus that depends on customer delight," says
Walter.  "What determines long-term success is customer loyalty, and we want
to engage everyone in that focus."

Bonuses of 30% for senior-level positions at AT&T are common, recruiters
indicate.  Walter declines to comment on specifics, but says, "we are willing
to pay significantly more than the competition if they earn it.  We
participate in salary surveys to determine compensation rates, so we know
we're competitive."

Downside of Risk

Although Advanta has several lines of business, three-quarters of revenues
derive from credit cards, so performance in that arena dictates overall
performance and share value.  Employees at every level are invited to take an
ownership position through a stock purchase plan and a 401-k plan that
includes Advanta stock as an investment option.  The stock purchase provides a
15% price discount and is limited to 15% of compensation.  "The trend
definitely is to be more inclusive in making bonuses an integral part of the
compensation package, so that pay has some risk involved, based on company
performance," Walp says.

Jack B.  Hofmann, Advanta vice president of human resources, willingly accepts
the risk of staff angst if the stock takes a bath.  "We're not the kind of
place that attracts people looking for security," he says.  "We generally
attract people who are willing to put their pay at risk.  That makes for a
more highly motivated work force."

The danger is that employees may end up sharing risks in market forces over
which they have no control.  A case in point is the collections area, where
consolidation is occurring at a rate significantly above that of card
issuance.  Smaller firms are ill-equipped to compete, and shareholder value is
plummeting for some.  A $100 investment in Payco American Corp.  in 1990 was
worth $59.14 at the end of 1994, and that drop is reflected in the pay of top
executives.

Top managers at Payco saw their bonuses slashed 10% last year, resulting in 4%
declines in total compensation for the two top executives.  Stock options
haven't been a factor in their packages since 1992.  And while there's
justification in holding a president and chairman accountable for a decline in
corporate profitability, the connection becomes more tenuous when people have
a limited impact on strategic success.

That may have been part of the thinking of Hatim A.  Tyabji, president and
chief executive of terminal maker VeriFone Inc., who asked his board to forgo
cash bonuses for himself and other executives after earnings and stock prices
dipped in 1993.

Though VeriFone's performance improved in 1994, Tyabji made the same request
last year.  Instead, he asked that cash bonuses be used for a cash and
time-off bonus program for all employees.  The board agreed and also granted
stock options to the executive officers.

VeriFone's balancing act is instructive for all corporations as incentive pay
continues to get pushed further down the line.  Everyone enjoys sharing the
rewards, but there's a limit to the amount of risk that can be imposed on the
rank and file.

Sweeter Deals for Entry-Level Workers


Compensation that reflects shareholder value is a given for occupants of the
executive suite, but the same philosophy is being extended all the way down to
entry-level service workers at some card shops.

Performance bonuses are most common in collections and recoveries, an area
where the cost-effectiveness of rewarding top performers is easily measured.
"It's easy to create incentives to make sure your top performers get the most
pay in that area, but it's more of a challenge to incent strict
customer-service jobs," says Kathy A.  O'Doherty, human resources manager for
First Chicago Corp.'s First Card operation.

Advanta Corp.'s Jack B.  Hofmann isn't so sure.  "There are all kinds of ways
to make call-center jobs fun while linking them to clearly defined outcomes,"
the vice president of human resources believes.  Trips and prizes, in addition
to cash, are all part of the incentive mix for hourly employees at Advanta.
"People are motivated by more than money," Hofmann says.  "They want to be
challenged and recognized."

Customer service and other hourly positions are pegged to the going wage rate
in a geographic market, not to any prevailing industry rate, points out Jo
Anne R.  Moeller, who oversees compensation for Banc One Corp.'s 50,000
employees.  But being competitive isn't enough when full-tilt expansion is on
the agenda, and that's the challenge faced by Capital One Financial Corp.,
which intends to add 1,000 entry-level jobs in the Richmond, Va., market alone
this year.

To increase the desirability of Capital One over other local firms, the
company is rolling out a benefits package that includes health insurance for
all associates working 20 hours or more per week, and three weeks vacation
after a year.  "We're competing for people in a very tight labor market,"
explains Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human resources.

Thus, Capital One decided to reallocate resources to reward people more in the
earlier stages of their careers rather than on the basis of seniority and
position.  By slashing employee attrition and going to more of a managed
health-care approach, Liberson expects the new benefits package to end up
costing the same as the program it replaces.

Liberson also expects retention of longer-term employees to be aided by the
stock-option plan Capital One introduced in March.  Besides giving employees a
very real stake in the company's performance, that program is creating
stock-ticker watchers out of 20-something workers with no investment
experience.

The change is reflected in the types of questions top executives hear at
monthly "town meetings" for employees at various Capital One facilities.
"They're fielding fewer questions on mundane, trivial personnel stuff, and
more on the company's business strategy and stock price," reports Liberson.
"The climate is different."

Number-Crunchers Are a Hot Commodity


For young people interested in a career in credit cards, here's a word of
advise:  buy a calculator, get a pocket protector, and master the art of
mathematical model-building.  The credit card industry wants numbers people,
and it's bidding up the price for good ones.

"The competition this year for credit policy and risk specialists is tougher
than I've ever seen it," one frazzled card recruiter reports.

With one eye on rising delinquencies and the other on analysts' resumes,
portfolio managers are trying to hire the experts who can minimize losses and,
hopefully, boost profits.  Helping to make these skills white-hot is
competition for those experts from new quarters.  Long-distance telephone
companies and utilities are discovering a need for risk-management help, and
they are bidding for the services of the banking industry's stars in risk
scoring, credit policy, and modeling.

"Data is data, and if you can leverage it into a model that reduces losses or
increases profitability for an issuer, that can mean millions of dollars to a
company," says Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc., a New York
firm specializing in placing people in analytical functions.  "An analyst with
one year's experience can pretty much move anywhere in the country."

Recruiter Judy Collins of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest points to the
work of Fair, Isaac and Company and CCN-MDS in modeling for sparking the job
boom.  "The tools became available for this business, and that is creating the
demand for people with backgrounds in math, computer science, or some other
numbers-type of degree," she says.

On the other hand, people with general management backgrounds may find the
going rough in the coming years.  "It's a soft market for people-to-people
skills," Collins notes.

The Nine Lives of Dale Browning


You might say, card industry utility man D.  Dale Browning can't resist a
challenge.

When asked by friends to evaluate Golden, Colo.-based ProCard Inc., a
struggling procurement card company they were thinking about investing in,
Browning quickly accepted.  After weeks of review of the ProCard operation and
its strengths and weaknesses, Browning returned to his friends with a 30-page
report, a two-hour presentation, and the conviction that ProCard had
potential.  "The more I studied the company, the more I concluded that it has
a very, very good product," he says.  "But it had not been marketed properly
and not enough money had been put behind it."

So, when his friends asked Browning to invest in the 6-year-old privately held
company, "I thought about it for a week," Browning says.  "Then I said I
wouldn't make an investment unless I could manage the company.  They agreed."
Once again, the industry veteran found himself in the middle of an emerging
market:  the corporate purchasing card arena.

Indeed, it came as no surprise to friends and industry observers that Browning
jumped at the chance to pump new life into ProCard.  Browning has decades-long
experience in all facets of the card business, is familiar with procurement
card programs, and has a track record of operating successful card programs,
says Denny D.  Dumler, president of Visa Plus, Visa's on-line global
automated-teller-machine network.  Dumler worked closely with Browning for
nearly 25 years, first at Rocky Mountain Bankcard System and later at Plus.
"I can't think of anyone better equipped" to run ProCard, Dumler says.  "He's
a real giant in the industry."

A Pioneer

Browning's professional life has been one of breaking new ground, first in
bank cards-in 1969, he participated in the creation of BankAmericard, the
forerunner of Visa-and later in electronic banking and debit cards-he served
on a committee that designed the first off-line debit card, which evolved into
the Visa check card.

And Browning's accomplishments didn't stop there.  During his 25-year tenure
at Colorado National Bank, he made the Denver-based bank a force to be
reckoned with in both consumer credit cards and electronic banking.  In 1968,
he founded Rocky Mountain BankCard System, the card issuing subsidiary of
Colorado National Bank, and one of the largest bank card processors in the
western United States.  While there, he helped develop a card program for the
U.S.  government, a prototype for what is now known as a procurement card.

Browning followed that in 1982 with the creation of Plus System Inc., a
regional electronic banking network which later evolved into the first
national automated-teller network in the U.S.  And he served as president of
CNB and Rocky Mountain from 1986 until November 1993.  He continued as chief
executive of Plus until 1993 when Visa took over that company.

At that time, Browning became senior consultant to Visa International.  And
when offered the opportunity to take over ProCard, he couldn't refuse.  "The
more time I spent at (ProCard), the more intrigued I was with the software,"
he says.  "The software was quite flexible.  The enhancements they were
working on would greatly increase their ability to compete and handle
additional volume."  ProCard's PC-based software provides an integrated
purchasing card management system designed to reduce the administrative costs
of procurement card programs.

In addition, Browning says, "I was impressed with the people who worked
there."

To be sure, ProCard-which provides backroom support for banks offering
corporate card products and services-has a lot going for it.  An early entrant
in the corporate purchasing card arena, it serves four banks nationwide-First
National Bank of Chicago, National City Bank, NationsBank, and Cass Bank, the
nation's largest freight-payment provider.  In September, when Browning took
over as president and chief executive, some 420 corporations, including 100
Fortune 500 companies, used ProCard services.  During the first few months
under Browning, ProCard added about 120 new corporations and was in
discussions with about a dozen others.

Different Direction

But ProCard was a victim of its own success:  It had trouble keeping pace with
the demand for its services.  In early September, the company had a backlog of
80 corporate users waiting for software to link the ProCard system to their
general ledgers, Browning says.  And that slowed system growth in both volume
and number of customers.

Despite these problems, however, ProCard is the right product for the right
time, Browning says.  "The timing is right," he says.  "Within the last year,
there have been more banks committed to procurement or purchasing card
programs than in all the years prior.  It's going to be like a snowball going
downhill."  Indeed, the volume on ProCard cards alone is increasing by 20% a
month compared to a year ago, Browning adds.

But before ProCard can reach its potential, it needs to head in a different
direction, Browning says.  Under the strategy mapped out by ousted founder and
former chief executive Stanley Anderson, client banks had to conform to
ProCard's requirements.  For example, ProCard worked exclusively with
MasterCard International.  "This company is no different than other software
companies," Browning says.  "It should support all products irrespective of
how they're branded in the marketplace."  ProCard now works with both the Visa
and MasterCard associations.

Anderson says he planned to make ProCard brand neutral, but was initially
limited to MasterCard because ProCard was using software from Columbus,
Ga.-based processor Total System Services Inc.  that was compatible only with
MasterCard's system.

ProCard also used to work exclusively with a single processor-Total System,
another fundamental mistake in Browning's eyes.  "A company should be
responsive to the needs of the banks, not make the banks go with its
processors," he says.  ProCard is negotiating agreements that enable it to
link up with any processor.

What's more, ProCard formerly required clients to buy the entire procurement
card package, from software to training to client services, Browning says.
"We debundled all that," he says.  "A bank can select and choose what services
it wants to buy.  It doesn't have to buy the whole package."

The ProCard package enables banks and their corporate clients to review, edit,
audit, and reconcile bank card transactions on a daily basis and
electronically post the purchases to the companies' general ledger systems.

European Retreat

After assuming control of ProCard, Browning also shut down the company's
European office.  "In my view, we hadn't capitalized on the opportunities in
the U.S.  For this company to take on the responsibility (of the European
market) meant we'd have to expand at the expense of the U.S."  Ownership of
the European operation-Ireland-based ProCard Inc.  Ltd.-was awarded to
Anderson when he left the company in July.

But even this shift in underlying philosophy isn't enough to guarantee success
for ProCard.  In its rush to meet customer demands for specialized information
reporting, ProCard "spent quite a bit of money putting in fixes to systems"
rather than looking at what enhancements the program might need in the long
term, Browning says.  "Now we're reallocating resources on working on a
completely new system with all the enhancements," he says.

ProCard is expanding beyond transaction processing to providing value-enhanced
functions, for example, breaking out information for corporations required to
report on transactions with minority vendors.  Those enhancements are
scheduled for release in mid-1996.

Already, ProCard has corrected many of the problems resulting from its rapid
growth.  Since taking over at ProCard, Browning has funneled more resources to
upgrading software and hardware to cope with the expected growth in volume.
The new product system-expected to be in place by the middle of this
month-will handle four times the volume and do it in half the time, Browning
says.

And the company also has eliminated the 3 1/2 month backlog of some 90
corporate clients waiting to come up on the ProCard system by hiring 10
additional computer programmers.  "Now we have a backlog of 30 companies,
which is super.  That's as fast as we can do it," Browning says.  "The
turnaround from the time the corporation signs and the custom programming is
less than four weeks."

ProCard has also added new staff to go out to the corporate clients and train
their employees.  And the company is setting up a customer-service center that
will take calls directly from the banks' procurement card customers, rather
than having the corporate customers call the bank first.  "The bank won't have
to build its own infrastructure," Browning says.  "The bank tells us how they
want the calls handled.  And the (corporate) customer will think he's dealing
with the bank."

With all these changes, Browning says he believes ProCard will be able to
capture a large share of the procurement card market.  But he concedes that it
will take time to get ProCard back on track.  "In a couple of years, we'll get
the company going down the right path," he says.

If that happens, Browning will have yet another success story to add to his
list of accomplishments

Catch-Up Time At MasterCard


In an exploding U.S.  debit card market, the contest for bank card association
supremacy is turning into more of a rout than a race.  For while MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A.  offer similar products and both have
implemented aggressive marketing strategies, Visa has solid control of the
off-line card market, and is processing millions more on-line point-of-sale
transactions monthly.  Now MasterCard, with new leaders at its debit helm, is
trying to pull something out of its hat that will cut into Visa's lead.

Through the first half of 1995, 5.8 million MasterMoney off-line cards had
been issued by 665 financial institutions, compared to 25.1 million Visa check
cards by 1,808 issuers.  MasterCard refuses to release transactions figures
for its Maestro on-line debit product, but analysts believe it is low.  Visa's
Interlink, meanwhile, is the largest on-line POS network, processing more than
15.8 million monthly transactions.

It's against this background of Visa dominance that Purchase, N.Y.-based
MasterCard is launching different marketing projects while simultaneously
adjusting to management changes.  Last summer it was announced that G.  Henry
Mundt III, president of MasterCard's Cirrus System Inc.  global automated
teller machine network, would become executive vice president of MasterCard's
Global Debit Services Group, replacing John O.  Smith who planned to retire at
year end.  Steven L.  Van Fleet is replacing Smith as general manager of
Maestro International.

And in October, Arthur Kranzley, who headed Maestro in the U.S.  since its
formation in 1993, left to become senior vice president for Horsham, Pa.-based
Advanta Corp., a non-bank financial-services provider and a major credit card
issuer that employs former MasterCard chief Alex W.  "Pete" Hart.  Kranzley's
replacement has not been named.

Hard Press

Though Mundt emphasizes that the personnel moves will not affect MasterCard's
strategies and that most of the MasterMoney and Maestro management teams are
unchanged, analysts still expect it to be years before MasterCard is able to
significantly reduce Visa's debit lead in the U.S.  Observers attribute
MasterCard's position to its previous debit strategy that emphasized Maestro's
international expansion, rather than MasterMoney's or Maestro's domestic
growth.  Most U.S.  card issuers give off-line cards marketing priority
because the products generate much larger interchange revenues ("The Debit
Card Balancing Act," December, 1995).

"When MasterCard was building up Maestro, Visa was putting the hard press on
the Visa check card," says D.  Mark Jackson, vice president of St.
Louis-based Boatmen's Bancshares, a leading MasterMoney issuer.  "After
MasterCard redirected it focus, Visa check card already had a huge lead.  And
once a bank is issuing cards, it is hard to get them to change brands."

Visa gained its off-line advantage in spite of MasterMoney's interchange fee
schedule that generates higher transaction revenues for issuers than does the
Visa check card.  On a $100 non-supermarket purchase, MasterMoney acquirers
pay card issuers between $1.31 and $1.69 for electronic transactions, compared
to $1.08 when a Visa check card is used.

Among the strategies used by Visa to expand Visa check card issuance are
market launches in specific cities that feature month-long advertising
campaigns utilizing such vehicles as newspapers and radio.

Assisting Issuers

With Visa dominating the off-line market, MasterCard finds itself working
harder to expand its presence.  The association is running television
commercials that explain how MasterMoney operates.  And MasterCard's 1996
focus will be to assist issuers in broadening their card bases, and triggering
more activity.  Initiatives will include regional and local advertising,
including direct mail.

"The bottom line is that Visa and MasterCard have good off-line debit products
and there is a still huge, uncommitted, market out there," Mundt says.  About
65% of financial institutions are not yet issuing off-line cards.

But while MasterMoney is gaining strength domestically, Maestro's strongest
impact has been overseas.  Though only about 13 million Maestro cards have
been issued in the U.S., 100 million cards are committed worldwide.  Maestro
is particularly strong in Latin America, where 5.5 million cards have been
issued in the last two years in such countries as Argentina, Chile, Ecuador,
Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.

This strong international activity eventually will spread to the U.S., Maestro
executives believe.  Mundt projects Maestro's growth rate will exceed that of
Cirrus.  The ATM network, which had volume of just 60,000 transactions during
its first year in 1983, is expected to have processed more than 300 million
transactions in 1995.  Maestro has more than 55,000 merchant locations,
compared to more than 64,000 for Interlink.

Shifting Emphasis

To stimulate Maestro expansion in the U.S., MasterCard is shifting its
emphasis from issuers to signing merchant acquirers.  The association's goal
is to have the nation's top 50 credit card acquirers processing Maestro
transactions this year, up from 36 in 1995, and it is aggressively lobbying
independent sales organizations to sell Maestro to merchants.  Maestro also
teamed with terminal vendor VeriFone Inc.  in 1995 for a so-called Travel
Destination Program.  In that program, acquirers in key traveler locations
that sign merchants to accept Maestro receive such awards as VeriFone
terminals and personal-identification-number pads.

MasterCard expects 5,500 PIN pads and 400 terminals sets will be distributed
in the program.  Analysts estimate more than $200,000 worth of hardware will
be awarded.

Merchants also will receive price breaks on terminals as an incentive to
upgrade or trade in devices so they can support such products as debit cards
and smart cards, and electronic-purse and cardholder- loyalty programs.
Merchants and acquirers that move from paper-based systems to electronics also
will receive processing discounts.  Furthermore, Maestro is targeting
merchants that traditionally have shunned debit cards, including such chain
retailers as apparel and shoe stores, lower-cost hotels and motels, and
car-rental agencies.  MasterCard is launching a pilot with its St.
Louis-based BankMate shared regional network and Enterprise Rent-A-Car for
debit card acceptance in 20 Midwest locations.  "There is a huge market for
merchants where the customer has to pay in advance," says Carl Stefanelli,
Maestro vice president.

Momentum

By getting more merchants on board, Maestro is trying to ride an expansion
wave created in 1995 when San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, a founding
member of Interlink, left the Visa-owned network for Maestro.  Wells is the
third-largest on-line card issuer as well as the third-largest debit acquiring
institution.  Factors that prompted the move included MasterCard's long-term
strategies, pricing, service levels, and partnerships.

"MasterCard is very focused on the on-line product, which is what Wells Fargo
needed for our customers," says Debra B.  Rossi, Wells Fargo senior vice
president, adding that the association doesn't short the MasterMoney card,
either.  "They don't rob Paul to pay Peter," she says.

Yet, even with its initiatives, Maestro still has a long road to travel before
it matches Interlink's activity.  When both networks went national in 1992,
Interlink already was the largest regional POS network in the United States,
with strong name recognition and activity on the West Coast.  Maestro started
from scratch.

"Maestro's problem is that it lacks the visibility of Interlink," says an
industry consultant familiar with MasterCard who insists on anonymity.  "It
will be more difficult for them to expand in the U.S.  than even for the
regional networks, which already have a solid market penetration."

But with its strong international presence and new domestic tactics,
MasterCard's debit movement could just be starting to hit stride.  "Our
strategy is the right strategy for a global basis," Mundt says.  "On-line,
PIN-based debit is where people want us to go."

Throwing Down The Gauntlet


The foreign invasion of the burgeoning point-of-sale market in the United
States is getting stronger with the entry of another international powerhouse.
Scotland-based De La Rue Fortronic, which controls a large chunk of the
European terminal market, has begun a North American operation in Hartland,
Wis., with a strategy of opening additional U.S.  offices and creating a
national sales force.

De La Rue is joining the stream of international vendors positioning for the
expansion of smart card programs.  While the company has shipped more than
400,000 terminals overseas and controls 45% of the United Kingdom market, 35%
of the German market, 60% of the Norwegian, and 70% of the POS terminal market
in the Netherlands, De La Rue's U.S.  presence is slight, with its terminals
just being used in small pilots.  But the company could soon become a North
American fixture.

More than 50% of De La Rue's revenues are projected to be generated from the
U.S.  within five years.  It expects to open offices on the East and West
Coasts, with a sales force situated throughout the continent.  "We're not a
flash in the pan," says Phillip Johnston, De La Rue Fortronic president.  "We
have the money and backing to make a big impact."

Laying a Foundation

De La Rue already has started laying the foundation for its North American
push.  Currently, it is the only supplier of devices for London-based Mondex's
electronic purse program, and Wells Fargo Bank is using De La Rue terminals
for its employee test of the Mondex system in Wells' San Francisco
headquarters ("Mondex Leaves the Station," October, 1995).  Guelph, Ontario,
will launch a city-wide Mondex pilot next year.  De La Rue also expects to
supply at least half the terminals for Visa's stored-value program that will
be launched in Atlanta in July in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.
More than 5,000 merchant locations are expected to accept smart cards in the
Atlanta area.

Yet, in addition to smart card tests, De La Rue is moving into more mainstream
markets.  It is selling an unspecified number of its F95 POS devices and
software to Atlanta-based processor Nova Information Systems for deployment in
hotels and motels.  Nova recently combined its merchant bank card business
with First Union Corp.'s and First Fidelity Bancorporation's, creating the
nation's eighth-largest merchant-processing operation servicing more than
90,000 retailers.

Nova selected the De La Rue devices because the terminals have memory that is
several times greater than other vendors' devices that sell for a similar
price, says Joseph P.  Cohane, Nova vice president.  The enhanced capacity
will permit Nova to support a variety of applications on a single device, such
as frequent-user programs and check-guarantee services.

The processor also wants to support smart card programs, and De La Rue devices
are successfully operating in European chip card programs, such as Mondex in
England, Cohane says.

Starting from Scratch

But while De La Rue is the latest in a growing list of foreign-based vendors
pushing into the North American market, the company is following a
less-traveled path by starting its operation from scratch instead of
purchasing an established American company.

Before setting up shop in the U.S., De La Rue's terminals were distributed
domestically by Hartland-based Direct Data.  When Direct Data ceased
operations last September, De La Rue created its own U.S.  operation to have
stronger control over the sales and marketing of its devices.  Its Hartland
headquarters will handle sales and marketing, software development, product
management, distribution, and customer service.  Terminals will be
manufactured near De La Rue's Dunfermline, Scotland, world headquarters.

Even as De La Rue gets its house in order, executives say the company already
is well equipped to take market share away from the U.S.' two largest and
better-known terminal vendors, Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone Inc., and
Phoenix-based Hypercom Inc., in addition to other players that have increased
their marketing efforts in the last year, such as Minneapolis-based DataCard
and Redwood City-based Atalla.  The company has deep pockets, a strong product
line, and international success.  Its parent company, The De La Rue Group, had
operating revenues of $1.2 billion last year with a profit of $230.4 million.
De La Rue Fortronic generated $45 million in revenues.

The company also can leverage a 600-person service organization situated
across the U.S.  that currently services the The De La Rue Group's other
banking products, such as coin counters.  Johnston says De La Rue will
emphasize its full range of offerings to prospective customers, including
smart card applications; open architecture, which permits terminal users to
create their own software programs; and loyalty programs that can be tailored
to support individual retailers.  "We're the experts in smart card technology,
and if we didn't think we could gain major footing in the U.S., we wouldn't be
here," Johnston says.

Despite De La Rue's aggressive push into the U.S.  market, some of its more
established U.S.  competitors do not expect to change strategies to compete
with the upstart.  "I don't think (De La Rue) brings much to the party in
terms of technology," says Albert Irato, Hypercom president.  "It will have no
impact on us whatsoever."

The Line-Up

De La Rue's main products include the F95 terminal, which features 640
kilobytes of memory, an integrated printer, two-line display, and an optional
smart card reader.  Most terminals shipped over the last few years have only
32 or 64 kilobytes of memory.  Devices with greater memory can support more
complex and a greater number of applications, such as frequent-shopper and
smart card programs, in addition to standard debit and credit.  The terminal
sells for under $400.

The F105 product, which is being used in the Mondex program, features a
display which permits consumers to view the balance remaining on their
stored-value cards.  The device is priced at approximately $500.

In addition to supporting Mondex, which has 8,000 cardholders and 750
merchants participating in an electronic-purse program in Swindon, England, De
La Rue has supplied more than 2,000 F95 devices to Shell Oil Co.  that are
being used in a British customer-loyalty program.  De La Rue also will supply
terminals for Visa smart card pilots this year in Australia and Canada.

But while De La Rue is active internationally, its key aim is to import that
success to the U.S., and some analysts believe the company has the ability to
gain a domestic toehold.  "It will be an uphill battle for De La Rue, but they
have the resources and a good track record in Europe," says Jerome Svigals, a
Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.  "There is a big market and
De La Rue could very well be a successful contender."

Some More Elbow Grease, Please


Faced with fiercer competition than ever, credit card marketers returned to
the basics when they advertised their products in 1995.  The mind-numbing
onslaught in 1994 of ill-conceived television commercials featuring big-budget
special effects and print ads narrowly focused on price ("The Best of a Bad
Lot," December, 1994) were replaced by higher-quality work that deftly put
brand image first and product information second.

That's not to say card marketers have abandoned playing up key selling points,
such as interest rates and rebates, in their ads.  On the contrary, that
nuts-and-bolts technique flourishes in direct mail, where introductory
interest rates and other cardholder perks routinely appear on the front of
envelopes to draw consumers into the offer.

While the entries submitted for this year's Credit Card Management Card
Industry Marketing Awards earned higher marks from the marketing experts the
magazine assembled to judge them, the overall quality of the entries fell
short of winning the judges' highest praise.  Card marketers have plenty of
room for improvement, the judges say.

Judging the television commercials and print ads was Richard Kimmel, president
of Chicago-based Kimmel & Co.  J.  Randy Howell, vice president and senior art
director for Chicago-based DraftDirect Worldwide, judged the direct-mail
pieces.

The ads submitted in the print and television categories that failed to earn a
thumbs up were sunk by story lines irrelevant to selling credit cards,
non-distinctive brand positioning, and poor execution.  "Consumers simply
won't take time to unravel the message of a poorly constructed ad," Kimmel
argues.

At the same time, many of the direct-mail entries were weakened by verbose
copy and one-size-fits-all product positioning.  "There are really no rules
when it comes to the creative side, but successful direct marketers know their
target audience and don't make the package threatening or difficult to
understand," says Howell.

Given the shortcomings of this year's contestants, only four entries earned
recognition in the television and print categories, rather than the usual
five.  Nonetheless, our judges, both professional marketers, still found
several gems that clearly stated the brand image of the card and which were
supported by lucid copy points.

"Effective advertising takes a unique position in the marketplace," says
Kimmel.  "Unique positions can be successfully defended because they are
unlike those taken by competitors.  Consumers remember uniquely positioned
campaigns."

The surprise of this year's judging is that for the first time in the
seven-year history of the competition, neither American Express Co.,
MasterCard International, nor Visa U.S.A.  earned first-place honors in the
television category.  That distinction went to Citibank, which also netted top
honors in the print category.  Stern's, a division of Federated Department
Stores Inc., finished atop the heap in direct mail.  All observations are
based on our judges' comments.

Category:  Television Commercials

Television is one of the most power advertising mediums available because it
can use emotion and information to seize, define, and fortify a product's
position in the marketplace like no other medium, says Kimmel.  This year's
winning television ads do just that.  "Establishing a unique position is the
most important task of any ad campaign," says Kimmel.

First Place:  "Tuxedo,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.

After years of being a bridesmaid, Citibank finally gets to the awards altar
with this story of a T-shirt and jeans guy who doesn't spend a lot of money on
clothes, but who decides to go all out for his wedding day by purchasing a
tuxedo.  He pays for the tux with, you guessed it, his Citibank card.  Why
should viewers care?  Because Citibank was conscientious enough to call the
young man to make certain that the charge for an expensive tuxedo, an atypical
purchase for him, wasn't fraudulent.  It's the kind of service people don't
expect from a card issuer, but which makes the bridegroom very happy.

"This is the type of ad that takes a position in the market and builds a brand
image," says Kimmel.  "Citibank not only says it has a good product, it does a
wonderful job of telling people they give them something more than a credit
card-they serve the customer.  It's a well-executed commercial."

Second Place:  Toys 'R Us Visa,Bank of New York.  BBDO New York.

Ad agency BBDO uses clever camera angles and a play on words to bring a
fun-and-games perspective to a credit card that earns cardholders discounts on
toys based on their spending.  The slick-looking sports car the narrator is
sitting in as he informs prospective customers they can earn discounts toward
a new car when they buy a set of tires turns out to be an optical illusion.
The auto actually is a toy photographed to look like the real thing.  So, too,
is the boat hitched to the car, which the narrator says also can be bought at
a discounted price.

After dazzling viewers with this photographic hocus-pocus, the narrator
succinctly explains the card's benefits-discounts earned on Toys 'R Us
purchases for each transaction.  "The photographic sleight of hand is very
appropriate and doesn't divert viewer's attention from the sales message,"
says Kimmel.  "The benefits of the card are clearly spelled out.  It's a
charming piece of work."

Third Place:  "Vacation,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.

This story of a dad doing his job as a father is the follow-up to Citibank's
top-ranked "Tuxedo."  There's Dad talking about a recent family getaway.  One
day the wife informs him the family needs a vacation, the next day Dad is
packing everyone up for a road trip-it's his job.  Once on the road, the
family spends "a gazillion dollars" buying cheap souvenirs that will wind up
collecting dust in the closet.  Dad begrudgingly pays for it all because it's
his job.  Soon afterward, the family car breaks down.  Dad gripes and moans,
calls a tow truck and pays for the repairs-it's his job.  Dad's choice of
currency?  His Citibank card, which takes care of all his credit needs-that's
Citibank's job.

While this commercial effectively builds on the brand positioning in "Tuxedo,"
it could have more clearly explained the benefit of packing a Citi card when
mishaps occur, says Kimmel.  "You're guessing at the what the benefit is," he
explains.  "It's not clearly explained how Citibank solved the problem in a
way no other issuer can.  But it's still a good piece of work."

Fourth Place:  "Locked Out,"American Express.  Ogilvy & Mather.

Celebrities make effective product endorsers, because the sight of them
instantly grabs viewers' attention.  In this spot, comedian Jerry Seinfeld
engages in a ridiculous romp after locking himself out of his apartment while
preparing for a date.  Dressed only in a bathrobe and with just minutes before
his date arrives, Seinfeld, who just happens to have his AmEx card, dashes
across the street to buy a suit.  Emerging moments later in his dapper duds,
Seinfeld pulls together all the pieces he needs for a magical evening.  In
whirlwind fashion he tracks down a locksmith to open the door to his
apartment, purchases a bouquet of flowers and hires a quartet.  He even buys
an umbrella when an unexpected rain shower kicks up.  All the purchases are
made possible by his AmEx card.  His apartment door unlocked moments before
his date arrives, Jerry has enough time to ice the champagne for his big
night.  Too bad the door lock jammed, and he can't let his date in.

While this ad scores high marks for clearly telling viewers in a creative way
that having an AmEx card can get them out of tight situations when they have
no cash, Seinfeld's trials are too far-fetched to convincingly support that
idea, Kimmel argues.  This ad has the ingredients to have placed higher, but
in its current state it is not in the same league as the top three finishers.

Category:  Print Advertising

Critics who argue print advertisers need to shift their focus away from image
toward price may want to rethink their case.  Consumers don't respond to the
hard sell from print ads.  Instead, they expect print ads to tell a visual
story that establishes a brand image.  "You can't shout numbers at people when
they aren't listening," says Kimmel.  This year's print ad winners do nothing
of the sort.

First Place:  Citibank.  Lowe and Partners/SMS.

Citibank strikes gold again with this clever play on the old adage that people
can't judge a book by its cover.  Two photos, one of a menacing motorcycle
rider and the other of a nerdy looking fellow, are juxtapositioned to make a
strong point about the value of Citibank's photocard.  The headline next to
the biker's photo says, "This is you."  The photo next to the nerd says, "This
is the creep who stole your wallet."  The copy at the bottom of the ad
explains that a Citibank photocard provides cardholders with the security of
knowing that if their card is ever lost or stolen, con artists will have a
tough time using it.  "The ad gets to the point, explains the value of the
product, and does so with a sense a humor," says Kimmel.

Second Place:  F&M Bank, Winchester, Va.  Barber Martin & Associates,
Richmond, Va.

The strength of this ad is its headline, "The Credit Card For People Who
Thought They Couldn't Get One."  It quickly grabs the reader's attention and
draws him into the copy points, where the value of the product is clearly
explained.  A brief description of how a secured card works is also included.
Since the only graphic elements are a photograph of an F&M card and the bank's
logo, the art direction doesn't get in the the way of the message.  "This ad
is clear and distinctly positions the product," says Kimmel.  "The headline
addresses the target audience.  It's not the most charming or personable ad,
but it is effective."

Third Place:  The Associates National Bank.  Parrish Wickersham & Partners,
Dallas.

This ad targeted at the coveted college-student market uses flippant MTV-style
graphics and a pointed headline, "Are You Ready for the Real World?"  to grab
the reader's attention.  The centerpiece is a picture of the Earth, over which
several statements about the everyday financial problems facing college
students are pasted.  Smack dab in the middle, in bold type, is the headline.
Succinct copy explains why students can benefit from an Associates credit
card, which sets up the tag line, "Real Plastic for the Real World."

"This ad is irreverent enough to spark the curiosity of college students,"
says Kimmel.  "It is pointed and makes the product sound useful enough to meet
their needs."

Fourth Place:  Old Kent Bank.  Felder Communications Group, Grand Rapids,
Mich.

This ad hawking Old Kent's Card Miles program, through which cardholders can
earn discounts on airline tickets, gets right to the point.  Key selling
points are summarized in bullet fashion-free airline tickets for all U.S.
airlines can be earned with 20,000 Card Miles, and there are no blackout
periods restricting the use of the tickets.  Copy points that explain
cardholders earn Card Miles points for all transactions, even for everyday
purchases such as gas, groceries, or dry cleaning, rescue a headline that is
too pointed-"Turn groceries into free plane tickets."  A winning effort, but
plenty of room for improvement, says Kimmel.

Category:  Direct Mail

Direct mail is the medium for the hard-sell, because consumers expect to be
bombarded with special deals through the mail.  The key, however, is not to
create a piece that makes consumers feel unimportant by using transparent
flattery or pitching an offer that they may feel is unaffordable, which in
turn makes them feel inadequate.  "Effective pieces address who their
customers are and what they want," says DraftDirect's Howell.  "Know your
market."

First Place:  Stern's (a division of Federated Department Stores Inc.)
Heinrich Marketing.

What puts this piece above the competition is the simplicity of its message.
The oversized envelope displays part of a $20 bill in a window, which
immediately implies the offer brings savings.  To the left of the window is a
green border-the color of money-with the headline, "What You See Is What You
Get."  At the bottom of the envelope is a tag line, "Extra Cash the Next Time
You Shop."

Inside, the letter features a $20 coupon good toward Stern's charge card
purchases.  The letter clearly lays out the benefits of accepting Stern's
preapproved credit offer:  a $20 coupon, and an additional 20% off purchases
the first day the card is used.  A postscript at the bottom of the page lists
the location of the Stern's store nearest the prospect.  The back side of the
letter displays a map listing the addresses of the 27 Stern's stores in New
York and New Jersey.  "This offers implies real value without talking down to
the customer, and summarizes the key points," says Howell.  "There is no
guessing as to what the offer is about."

Second Place:  Bank of New York.  Gillespie Advertising Inc.

This entry for Bank of New York's Toys 'R Us Visa earns high marks for its use
of four-color printing and the continuity of its marketing message throughout
the entire package-"Turn everyday spending into free toys."  The message is
repeated on both sides of the envelope.  Inside, a four-color, tri-fold flier
featuring silhouettes of children playing and the Toys 'R Us logo explains how
cardholders earn a 3% rebate on Toys 'R Us purchases and a 1% rebate on all
other purchases.  The rebates are redeemable toward discounts on future
purchases at Toys 'R Us as well as Kids 'R Us clothing stores.

The flier also mentions a program to earn discounts on family vacations
through Toys 'R Us.  The letter features the added caveat of a $10 Toys 'R Us
coupon for accepting the preapproved offer.  "It's a gorgeous package," says
Howell.  "There is continuity to the message in all the elements, and the
offer gets right to the point."

Third Place:  REI/SeaFirst Bank.  Hunt Marketing Group.

Using a plain, brown envelope with forest-green lettering and brown paper for
the letter gives this piece an understated look that plays to the austerity of
its target audience-outdoorsmen.  The envelope succinctly highlights the key
features of the offer:  no-annual fee, a 9.9% introductory interest rate, a 1%
rebate on purchases, and preapproved credit.

Inside, the brown-toned flier talks about Jack, a customer who earns 1%
rebates for purchases charged to his REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.)  gold
MasterCard, in addition to the rebates he earns as a member of REI's dividend
program.  These perks enabled Jack to not only buy a new parka for his wife,
but for himself, which makes Jack a "very happy camper."  "The color of this
package is not atypical, which helps it overcome initial consumer resistance,"
praises Howell.  "It has a simple, responsible look that appeals to its
audience."

Fourth Place:  Marine Midland Bank.  Marketing Resources.

This piece for Marine Midland's Humane Society Visa earns high marks for its
unconventional envelope headline, "The Visa Card Most Preferred by Everyone
From Alligators to Zebras."  Supplementing the idea are pictures of the
aforementioned animals.  A teaser rate of 9.9% and preapproved credit also are
highlighted.  Additional selling points, such as emergency card replacement
and a 24-hour toll-free customer-service number, are bulleted.  Inside, a
tri-fold flier and letter explain the card's services, and how the Humane
Society benefits from the card's use.  "The package has a little fun with the
idea of helping protect animals, and plays with the idea of covering
everything from A to Z with its envelope message," observes Howell.

Fifth Place:  Humane Society/PNC Bank.  Marketing Resources.

Unlike television and print advertising, where brand image is more critical,
numbers can still make the biggest impression in direct mail.  The strength of
this entry is its envelope, across the top of which are emblazoned three
figures, 8.75%, $0 and $5,000.  The numbers are designated, respectively, as
the introductory interest rate, annual fee, and maximum credit limit for the
card being pitched.  Underneath these figures is the headline, "Sometimes the
numbers speak for themselves."  Inside, a tri-fold flier, featuring a
question-and-answer section, addresses pertinent information about the card.
The letter includes a chart comparing interest rate charges paid on higher
rate cards to those on the PNC card for the same balances.  "This is an
easy-to-read piece that telegraphs the sales message and gets people inside
the package," says Howell.  "The flier tackles marketing points about the card
that may have fallen through the cracks, but the numbers say it all."

CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Love Letters From Wall Street


Despite the continued growth of major credit card issuers, Wall Street is
keeping one ear cocked for the first sounds of retrenchment in the extremely
competitive card issuing market, which explains the lukewarm reception to some
of the issuers' stocks.  But the same apprehension doesn't apply to
transaction processors, who are emerging as favorites of the investment
community.  Analysts have awakened to the realization that no matter whose
card consumers decide to carry and whether or not they pay balances off every
month or heap on more revolving debt, processors stand to gain from electronic
payment's growing share of consumer spending.

Though some processors are heavily dependent on a few large customers, buy
recommendations far outweigh hold positions, and nobody is urging investors to
sell.  As a consequence, stock prices for these firms are posting some
impressive gains, and analysts are bullish about the long-term outlook for
card processors.

From Wall Street's perspective, these are computer-services firms, and in that
category they are stars.  Recurring revenues are part of the appeal:  whereas
a software firm starts off each quarter with zero revenues, processors can
count on a steady income stream from merchants locked into multi-year
contracts.  Those revenues will only go up, too, as plastic increases its 7%
share of consumer discretionary spending.  And processors are positioning
themselves as turn-key payment solutions, with check-verification and
guarantee services, debit card acceptance, and any other non-cash payment
option that surfaces, such as corporate purchasing cards and stored-value
cards.

The processing business has fundamental strengths that appeal to many
investors.  The consolidation that is occurring among processors means a
bigger slice of an expanding pie for those that remain.  New competitors face
huge barriers to entry, and the economies of scale keep getting better.

The 800-Pound Gorilla

That said, observers nonetheless are keeping an eye on firms such as AT&T Co.
and Microsoft Inc.  that might try to make a name for themselves in card
processing.  MCI Telecommunications Corp.  gained a stake in 1993 when it
bought BT North America's processing operation.  More recently it acquired SHL
Systemshouse Ltd., a Canadian systems integrator, says Patrick M.  Burton,
information processing analyst at Lehman Brothers.  Still, new entrants are
almost obliged to find a strategic partner to compete, and the business's high
capitalization costs primarily benefits leading processor First Data Corp., he
says.

Indeed, the arrival of processing's proverbial 800-pound gorilla didn't dampen
investors' enthusiasm.  In the wake of Hackensack, N.J.-based First Data's
purchase of First Financial Management Corp., analysts retained their upbeat
prognostications for the other players.  And why not?  The only processors
they expect to take it in the neck, at least in the short term, are merchant
banks such as First National Bank of Omaha and Bank of America that compete
with FDC in the merchant end of the business.

Analyst Steven S.  Birer of Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco, has buy
recommendations for First Data and Riverwoods, Ill.-based SPS Transaction
Services Inc., noting the latter has been priced as an issuer since its
acquisition a year ago of electronic giant Tandy Corp.'s card portfolio, and
those price-earnings multiples typically are half the ratios of processors.

Value-Added Services

Meanwhile, FDC's versatility as both a merchant and cardholder processor has
captured investors' imaginations.  A wide range of value-added services can
now be promoted, including cash management and others that traditionally have
been the province of banks.  By virtue of its position as the largest merchant
and cardholder processor, FDC is in a position to offer services that other
acquirers have shied away from because of consumer privacy concerns, says
analyst Gregory M.  Gould of Goldman Sachs & Co.  For example, a deal could be
struck with a department store whereby cardholders invoiced by FDC would
receive on-the-spot discounts at those stores' cash registers, assuming FDC
drove them.

Since its spin-off in April 1992 from American Express Co., FDC has made five
significant purchases in the processing field:  NationalCard/NationalCheck
Processing Systems, TeleMoney Services, Envoy Corp.'s card business, Card
Establishment Services, and First Financial, parent of National Bancard Corp.
(NaBanco), the nation's largest merchant acquirer.  Between NaBanco, CES, and
its own in-house merchant-procession operation, "they must be approaching 30%
of the market," estimates Richard Robida, vice president and merchant
processing specialist with Speer and Associates.

For the time being, the situation at FDC is chaotic, with customers frustrated
and confused about which subsidiary is doing what, Robida says.  "For the most
part, the FDC/FFMC merger activities are happening behind-the-scene and our
clients' daily operation and service are not affected," a First Data
Spokesperson responds.  "Also, we're working hard to keep our clients,
employees, and shareholders informed about merger activities throughout the
transition."

But, once the latest merger is digested, banks that compete with FDC will face
a tough choice:  "Either they can become a low-cost provider and slug it out
for share, or adopt an exit strategy," he says.

Hambrecht & Quist's Birer altered his rating on National Data Corp.  to hold
after the FDC-First Financial merger was announced, reasoning that corporate
marriage "significantly changed the playing field."

Banker Exodus?

It's not just the analysts who have such opinions.  "The merger of First Data
and First Financial is going to create a significant amount of introspection
from the true bank card acquirers," suggests Richardson M.  Roberts, founder
and chairman of PMT Services Inc., who predicts many of them will conclude
card processing is divorced from their core business.  "This is more a
telecommunications business than a banking business.  It's not about making
loans, it's not just credit cards, it's a lot of other payment settlement."

If and when the major bank-owned merchant portfolios come into play, "I assure
you we'll be looking at them," says Roberts, who has been building a war chest
to make such a bid.

PMT, a Nashville-based independent sales organization that does business as
U.S.  Bankcard Center, received a warm reception last year when it became the
first ISO to make a public stock offering.  It priced at $8 a share in August
1994.  A second offering of 1.875 million shares in mid-September of 1995 sold
at $22.50 per share.  Six weeks later, the stock was hovering around $26.

Leveraged Growth

While allowing that quasi-processors like PMT inhabit a risky market niche
susceptible to high merchant turnover, analysts like their short-term
prospects.  Smith Barney rates PMT as a high-risk stock that will outperform
the market; Montgomery Securities rates it a solid buy.

Capital raised in its two stock sales gives PMT the ability to buy out more
competitors, something the firm has done 20 times in recent years.  The only
difference is, now it is able to buy bigger firms that cater to higher-volume
merchants than PMT traditionally has served.  That should give PMT more
leverage to drive down transaction costs while it improves service levels to
reduce merchant attrition.

Although most merchants are authorizing transactions electronically now, "a
third of them are still paper-based, so there is still great room for growth,"
Roberts says.  He estimates 800,000 to 1 million U.S.  merchants remain to be
converted.

With so many merchants likely to go electronic in the near future, Roberts
expects volume gains over and above the 15% to 20% annual transaction growth
forecast through the end of the century.  "At that point, credit cards will
only represent 17% of consumer payments," leaving room for considerable
growth, he points out.

Roberts was left with paper wealth of almost $18 million after selling
$675,000 worth of stock in September's offer.  He started the company in 1984
at age 26.  "Our success has convinced others that this is a great
opportunity," he says.

Uneasy Acquisition

Among the independent sales organizations eying a public stock sales, analysts
say, are Nova Information Systems Inc., which backed away from an initial
public offering last spring, and Gensar, which acquired the processing
operations of TransNet Inc.  three years ago.  Nova in November took over
First Union Corp.'s merchant portfolio, which had $2.8 billion in charge
volume in 1994, in return for First Union taking a 35% equity stake in the
processor.

One of the few processor sour notes in 1995 was sounded by retail card
specialist SPS Transaction Services, and that occurred through no fault of its
processing business.  Analysts fingered the recently acquired, $920 million
Tandy credit card portfolio for the blame.  That situation only fortified
investors' reservations about the card-issuing business:  even as the market
in general and the pure card issuers in particular continue to defy
predictions of a slowdown and post huge gains, issuing's inherent risk makes
them skittish.  The stock prices of issuers often take nose dives when reports
about higher delinquencies, chargeoffs, and bankruptcies come out-and such
reports may increase in the coming months.

By comparison, processors' predictable earnings are a safe haven for anyone
interested in investing in the card industry.  "SPS's stock had gone to $30,
but they had a little bit of a stumble with the Tandy portfolio and they
failed to hit their earnings projections," points out Burton of Lehman
Brothers.  "They need to regain their earnings momentum."  SPS had been
selling at about $26 a share in November, the same price it was at 12 months
earlier when it split two for one.

Among the current crop of publicly traded processors, Atlanta-based National
Data Corp.  is the only one that isn't drawing raves from Wall Street.
Montgomery Securities' Richard K.  Weingarten rates NDC a buy, but others in
the investment community are more reserved.  "It's not that there's a
particular problem," says Interstate Johnson Lane's Sandra Barker, who picked
up NDC two years ago and has rated it a hold ever since.  "It's more a
valuation comment than anything."  With the stock's price up about 40% in
1995, the P/E ratio is down to about 22 times 1996's projected earnings,
Goldman Sachs' Gould says.

NDC has slipped to a second-tier player in the front-end terminal driving
segment of the processing business, Speer's Robida says, with only Visa's
Merchant Bank Services and MasterCard's MAPP still able to challenge FDC for
supremacy.  Visa is aligning itself with Total System Services Inc.  as the
bankers' alternative to FDC.  NDC used to have a similar strategic alliance
with Total.  NDC also has been slow to move from a voice-authorization network
to an electronic authorizer, he adds, and that has hurt it, along with
business decisions in the past that alienated many bankers.

"That's absurd," responds a NDC spokesman, adding "the bulk" of NDC's
processing volume is electronic.  "You have to have some voice authorization
because your customers want it," he adds.

The richest processor stock is Columbus, Ga.-based Total, which trades at
about 50 times earnings.  Twelve years after its IPO, Total's parent, Synovus
Corp., still owns 81% of the stock.  Its high valuation makes Total the only
processor that Weingarten rates a hold.

Bullish Outlook

Weingarten forecasts 20% to 30% earnings growth for all of the half-dozen
processors he follows.  He characterizes the category as the new breed of
stock leaders, able to outperform the market year after year.  "Incentive
cards have helped processors gain tremendous share, but the real driver is
wider merchant acceptance," he says.  "When credit card growth slows, other
businesses like health care, stored-value cards, and electronic commerce will
start to feed in.  Twenty percent growth will continue for years."

Lehman's Burton is a little more restrained in his prognosis, but he too is
upbeat.  "The shift from cash and checks is continuing, and it could be
accelerating," he says.  He gives First Data and Check Free strong buy
recommendations, expects SPS to outperform the market, and rates St.  Paul,
Minn.-based Deluxe Corp.  (which acquired Financial Alliance Processing
Service, an ISO and processor) a hold.

Analysts fret about the impact on a processor if a large account should bolt.
Montgomery already has factored in the eventual loss by SPS of Lechmere, a
northeastern retailer that was acquired by Montgomery Ward a year ago and is
expected to take its processing business to GE Capital after court proceedings
are settled.

No other client danger flags are being raised, however.  Total relies on the
AT&T Universal card for a large share of its processing volume, but a
long-term extension last year gives the analysts comfort.  "It would concern
me more if the contract was coming up for renewal," notes Larry Hickey of
First Analysis Corp.  With NationsBank and Bank of America now working with
Total, the company isn't overly dependent on any single client, he points out.

The riskiness of credit granting keeps investors up at night and makes them
skittish about the pure card stocks like Advanta Corp., MBNA Corp., First USA
Inc., and Capital One Financial Corp.  The processors, on the other hand, are
a safe harbor and a good way to cash in on plastic's transformation to a major
transaction device.  As one analyst observes, "Boring is beautiful."

Indeed, the boring predictability of card processors' growth rates and margins
of 20% for the foreseeable future make this one of the most appealing classes
of stock on Wall Street.

CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Detente for Lawyers And Collectors?


Three years ago, they were the new kids on the block.  But now, electronic
attorney collection networks are proving themselves by boosting recoveries of
charged-off credit card debt and relieving card issuers of some of their legal
burdens.  And collections agencies, many of which vehemently opposed the
lawyer networks muscling their way onto collectors' turf, now are beginning to
accept the newcomers.

In fact, it's going beyond mere begrudging acceptance.  Some collections
agencies themselves have already formed or are planning alliances with
attorney networks.  And at least one agency might even create its own attorney
network.  "They're not mutually exclusive anymore," says Warren S.  Rosenfeld,
managing partner of McNeily, Rosenfeld & Associates, a Washington, D.C., law
firm that operates the Rosenfeld-Net.

Equifax Inc., the big credit-reporting agency that also owns a major
collections company, Equifax Risk Management Services, crystallized the new
attitude last October when it formed a venture with Rosenfeld's firm called
Litigation Access Web.  "The backdrop is the collection agencies have felt
this was our turf and were very reluctant to send any accounts out, or refer
to attorneys," says Lyle F.  Herrmann, Litigation Access Web product manager.
"And the attorneys were saying, 'why use collectors?' There was some finger
pointing and bragging rights-me, me, mine, mine, mine.  But there is an
effective place and role for the agency-type collector, and there is an
effective role for litigation."

Moving Closer

The folks who give the collections agencies and lawyers their business are
voicing similar opinions.  "Both sides are moving closer to each other," says
Eugene V.  Brugger, recovery manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Bank One
Columbus, which uses the National Attorney Network for part of its recovery
work.  "I think there's a realization that there's money to be made by
collaboration."

Besides NAN and Rosenfeld-Net, there are now several other attorney networks
(box, page 52).  They include the National Association of Retail Collection
Attorneys' NARCA-Net; Dozier Legal Network, a subsidiary of the Richmond,
Va.-based Dozier and Associates P.C.; and the network run by the American
Association of Collector Attorneys.

While the networks vary in the range of services they offer and technological
capabilities, the common thread is that they allow card issuers to place
charged-off accounts and supporting documents with law firms electronically.
That reduces the paper burden, and some networks make it easy for issuers,
using computers and software linked to the networks, to keep track of
litigation and the performance of each firm.

The networks also can quickly place accounts with their law-firm members,
which means issuers' lawyers can devote most of their attention to monitoring
what the firms acting on their behalf are doing rather than hunting for
competent attorneys wherever they have deadbeat customers.  "We're dealing
with one attorney instead of 50 attorneys in 50 different states," says Edward
J.  Casey, collection and recovery manager for Bridgeport, Conn.-based
People's Bank, which uses Rosenfeld-Net.  "It takes a big burden off of us."

Growth Industry

Sensing a growing need for such tracking and oversight services, the attorney
who founded the Dozier Legal Network, John W.  Dozier Jr., stopped doing
actual collections work last year when he founded his namesake network.  "We
came to the conclusion that in order for this to work, we (shouldn't be) a law
firm trying to run a computer network, we needed to be a technology company
providing a legal application," says Dozier, who hopes to have more than 400
law firms affiliated with his network by year's end, compared with 70 at the
end of 1995.

Indeed, the attorney networks almost unanimously are reporting strong growth.
AACA's network placed 16,000 accounts worth about $70 million last year, but
President Raymond J.  Cook projects 30,000 accounts and $140 million in
placements this year.  "Credit grantors want to try something different than
the traditional 'we'll place it with a collection agency approach,'" Cook
says.

Despite the networks' growth, one factor reducing tensions between the lawyers
and the collectors is the overall growth of the card industry.
General-purpose card receivables grew 20% in 1993 and 19% in 1994, and 1995's
growth will probably come close.  Such huge growth means lots of charged-off
debt even though credit quality, while showing some signs of fraying, still is
high.  In fact, card issuers probably can expect to recover about $2 billion
this year.

Thus, even some collectors who expressed deep skepticism about the new
attorney networks ("This Is No Lawyer Joke," April, 1994) profess today that
they're not too worried.  "From my personal perspective, they've not taken
anything at all (from us)," says Craig J.  Costanzo, chairman and chief
executive of Management Adjustment Bureau, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency that
handles about $100 million in charged-off card debt annually.  "There's just
so much business out there, it's unbelievable."

Doubling Recoveries

While a majority of the attorney networks have only brief track records, some
are starting to rack up impressive numbers-and thus forcing collection
agencies to take notice.  GE Capital Corp., the nation's largest third-party
retail card issuer, started placing accounts for legal action through
Atlanta-based NAN in 1994.  For the first nine months of 1995, recoveries
through NAN were 106% higher than they were for accounts placed for
conventional legal action in the same 1994 period.

The reason?  The electronic network makes it easy to monitor each account's
status, and to compare the performance of the approximately 70 law firms GE
Capital uses nationwide.  With more than 300,000 charged-off store card
accounts being placed for legal action yearly, fewer cases are getting lost in
the shuffle, says Mary K.  Kinsey, senior vice president of collections
services for GE Capital Credit Services.  "It really forces them (law firms)
to look at every single account," she says.

Money on the Table

While there are wide variations among individual issuers, collections experts
estimate that less than 5% of charged-off accounts-perhaps even as low as
2%-result in litigation.  But some observers say that as many as 10% of
deadbeat accounts should be litigated-a goal that's hard for national issuers
to hit as they struggle to manage dozens of law firms handling thousands of
cases.

The attorney networks say they can get the cases into court that should be in
court.  NAN's president, attorney Douglas W.  Wallace, says his network is
aiming for $1 billion in placements this year, compared with 300,000 credit
card claims for just over $500 million in 1995 and 120,000 claims for $240
million in 1994, the network's first year.  He estimates about 70% of the
cases referred to the 165 law firms in the network result in lawsuits.  "It's
a given that legal action is more effective than any other form of recovery,"
says Wallace.

Adds St.  Louis collections attorney Donald B.  Kramer, president of Kramer &
Frank P.C.  and founder of NARCA:  "Credit card issuers are used to getting a
6% recovery from collections agencies.  Attorneys can double or triple that as
long as they give the attorney enough time.  The agencies pour out the
pressure in the first 60 days, but if you look at the end of two years, they
attorneys absolutely kill the agencies."

Collection agencies, meanwhile, disagree with the practice by some issuers to
send certain deadbeat accounts directly to lawyers, even though agencies might
produce as good or better recovery rates.  "I think clients are making a poor
decision in sending straight to a network," says one collections executive who
insists on anonymity.

Though collections agencies may disagree with the attorneys' bluster, growing
numbers are acknowledging that lawyers have an increasingly important role in
recovering bad debt.  "I do believe that agencies, by not aligning themselves
with attorneys, are leaving a lot of money on the table," says Douglas B.
Schultz, chief executive officer of United Recovery Systems Inc., a Houston
collections agency which does work for seven of the 10 largest card issuers.
"I do see attorney-agency alliances in the future."

With that in mind, Schultz is considering a partnership with one of the
networks, though he hasn't decided on which one.  He might even form his own
network.

Profit Issue

And while Schultz can get along with lawyers, he nonetheless has some
misgivings about a formal business partnership because of the profit question.
If the issuer-client lets his agency keep 35% of the recovered debt, but the
lawyers take 25%, "that leaves only 10% for me," Schultz says.  And that thin
margin could be reduced even further depending on which party has to absorb
the court costs, he adds.

Still, Schultz thinks allying with attorney networks at the very least makes
sending paperwork back and forth easier-and thus makes clients happier.  And
if he can show card issuers that his recovery rates are going up because of
more legal action, so much the better, because it will bring more volume to
the agency.  "I don't think there's that much profit for the agencies, but
it's another option," he says.

Equifax retains an average of 33% of recoveries and hopes to make its new
Litigation Access Web service profitable by asking clients to absorb the court
costs.  As of early December, some 800 accounts had been referred to the legal
service, but Equifax's Herrmann says it's still too soon to quote recovery
rates.

Clearly, however, Equifax is looking to feather its already large collections
nest-$3 billion a year in placements, about a third of which is card debt-by
adding the legal network to its roster of services.  "We wanted to prove to
the industry that we could take the high road to have our collection-agency
business work hand-in-hand with an attorney network," says Herrmann.

Equifax's basic criteria for referral to the network hinges on the account
balance (less than $1,000 is less likely to be litigated), the span of time
since a payment, and whether the debtor has a valid address and is employed.
Debtors with jobs and assets upon which a court can slap a lien, such as a
house, are most likely to be sued.

Issuers and attorneys still have to be very careful about which consumers they
intend to sue.  Management Adjustment Bureau's Costanzo, who still remains
wary of the attorney networks, notes that the federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act makes it illegal to threaten lawsuits unless the threat is
followed by action.

But Banc One's Brugger says that his bank, for one, is scrupulous about what
it tells debtors.  "The only time we'll tell customers we're going to sue them
is if we have the intent," he says.

Ironically, the number of Bank One's lawsuits against cardholders has gone
down recently, according to Brugger who did not cite specific figures.  He
attributes that to more diligent work by the attorneys early in the process.

Even Costanzo concedes that correspondence from an attorney can scare payments
out of recalcitrant debtors.  "The fact that they send a letter out on an
attorney letterhead is very helpful," he says.

And as that notion gains more and more currency among issuers' collections
managers, the future looks increasingly bright for the attorney networks.

Send In the Repairmen


It's been well over a year since major amendments to the federal Bankruptcy
Code took effect.  The amendments were hailed by many creditors, including
credit card issuers, as important changes which would both curb bankruptcy
filings and significantly enhance bankruptcy recoveries.  To date, neither
benefit has materialized, although some of the amendments have had positive
results.

Indeed, bankruptcy filings have been on a 12-month increase.  When the final
1995 numbers are made official, total filings for the past year will likely be
in the neighborhood of 920,000, which would be the third-highest yearly total
ever.  The rate of increased bankruptcy filings for the past four quarters
echoes the bankruptcy explosion of the mid-1980s.

The 1994 Bankruptcy Code amendments also have yet to significantly increase
per-case recoveries.  As a result, card issuers are becoming more vocal in
demands for a further tightening of bankruptcy laws.

The Good News

One of the several positive changes made in 1994 was the raising of the
Chapter 13 debt ceiling to $250,000 of unsecured debt and $750,000 of secured
debt.  This allows more consumers to seek relief through reorganization of
personal debts under Chapter 13, as opposed to filings under Chapter 7, in
which the debtor's assets are liquidated, or Chapter 11, in which business and
personal debts are reorganized.  In the later two cases, recoveries to card
issuers have always been lower.  In some of the areas of the country, Chapter
11 filings have declined, while Chapter 13 filings have increased, although
only marginally.

Another positive change which holds promise for the long term was the
streamlining of the reaffirmation process by eliminating the need for court
approval.  By signing a reaffirmation agreement before a bankruptcy discharge
is entered, a debtor agrees to continued liability after bankruptcy.  Those
debtors who sign such agreements usually do so to avoid a creditor's complaint
contesting the discharge where the account was loaded up with charges before
the bankruptcy filing, or where an issuer has offered to let the debtor
continue to use the card account after bankruptcy.  The latter group includes
a growing number of issuers who see reaffirmation as a good way to cut
bankruptcy losses.

A third positive change was extending the so-called pre-bankruptcy presumption
period, during which the charges are presumed to be nondischargeable, to 60
days.  The presumption applies to both cash advances and luxury goods and
services where either exceeds $1,000.  This change is reported to have
effectively enhanced issuers' ability to quickly settle potential
dischargeability claims for relatively large sums.  Because so few accounts,
relative to total bankruptcy filings, have activity which rises to the level
of fraud required under the present bankruptcy code standard, actual increased
recoveries from this change, while significant, have not been dramatic.

Finally, the 1994 amendments created the National Bankruptcy Review
Commission, comprised of nine appointed members who have begun their two-year
mission to review the bankruptcy laws, take testimony from affected parties,
and make recommendations to Congress regarding future amendments.  While it is
a positive development to have a focal point for change, the obvious downside
would be congressional reluctance to consider changes before the commission
has weighed in with its report almost two years from now.  Issuers should,
therefore, consider a dual approach to reform:  long-term advocacy through the
commission and, hopefully, faster-track changes by seeking direct legislative
input into needed amendments.

Exemptions

A negative change in the 1994 law was the increase in the dollar value of
property debtors are allowed to protect from sale by a bankruptcy trustee.
The so-called federal-exemption amounts were doubled across the board.
Examples include the homestead exemption which was increased from $7,500 to
$15,000 ($30,000 for a married couple), and the household-goods exemption
which was doubled to $8,000 ($16,000 for a married couple).  Although the
federal exemptions only apply in 15 states, at least two of the 35 other
states have recently increased their exemption amounts.  One was California,
which doubled the exemptions available to its residents, citing the federal
increase as a basis.

Because so-called asset Chapter 7 cases can take two years or longer to
liquidate, it is still too early to tell the effect of the exemption change.
But because every exemption dollar comes directly out of funds which would
have otherwise gone to unsecured creditors, the negative effect will certainly
be significant.

Much of the past and present volume of bankruptcy filings is attributable to
the marketing of bankruptcy, both direct and indirect.  Indirect marketing
includes word of mouth (with almost 1 million filings per year, there are a
lot of voices out there), newspaper coverage (it is virtually impossible to
find an issue of any major-market newspaper that does not include an article
about a well-known company's or celebrity's bankruptcy filing), and how-to
books about bankruptcy.

All of these indirect marketing aspects have resulted in the almost complete
erosion of the stigma once attached to filing bankruptcy.  Yes, bankruptcy
still is an extreme emotional hardship for most people, but the reluctance to
file is much easier to overcome in an environment where famous individuals and
companies are often perceived (usually incorrectly) to be using bankruptcy
relief as a mere financial-planning device.

By far the most effective bankruptcy marketing, however, has been what is in
effect direct marketing by debtors' attorneys.  They have done an excellent
job of making consumers aware of the bankruptcy option through advertisements
in the Yellow Pages, newspapers and on television, and through targeted mail
sent directly to persons facing lawsuits for defaults.  It is no coincidence
that the bankruptcy explosion of the 1980s came on the heels of the Supreme
Court's relaxation of advertising restrictions upon attorneys.

Countering the Messages

In the face of this successful marketing of bankruptcy, major issuers have
been attempting for some time to communicate the negative aspects of a
bankruptcy filing to customers, most importantly a bankruptcy's negative
affect upon obtaining future credit.  Many issuers have also been actively
referring delinquent customers to local branches of the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service as an alternative to bankruptcy.  Some issuers have
advocated placing national newspaper ads explaining non-bankruptcy options.

Just as important as combating bankruptcy marketing is the need to focus upon
improving recoveries from the increasing number of bankruptcies.  In this
regard, it is useful to look at the big picture which shows that, nationally,
almost 70% of consumer cases are filed under Chapter 7.  Of these, only about
5% result in any recovery to card issuers.  Issuers' main bankruptcy
recoveries have always come from Chapter 13 repayment plan cases which,
unfortunately, are less than a third of all filings.

The main avenue to a dramatic increase in bankruptcy recoveries, then, is to
shift as many Chapter 7 cases as possible into Chapter 13.  This has been
tried repeatedly by suggesting amendments to Congress which would eliminate
Chapter 7 or greatly restrict its usage.  The only such change ever actually
to survive the political process and become enacted was the largely
ineffective substantial-abuse provision, added in 1984.  That provision allows
the court to dismiss a Chapter 7 filing if the judge determines the case
constitutes an abuse of the law.  It was intended to directly force those
debtors with sufficient income to fund a repayment plan into Chapter 13.  But
because of procedural and substantive problems inherent in the wording of the
statute, the provision has never had the desired effect, and is ripe for
further amendment.

Rather than focusing solely upon tightening the availability of Chapter 7
relief, however, issuers should consider ways in which Chapter 13 can be
enhanced and thereby made more attractive to consumers.  A common complaint
among debtors' attorneys and Chapter 13 trustees is that debtors have no
incentive to repay unsecured creditors under Chapter 13.  This is because,
they argue, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is just as likely to result in the denial
of future credit as is a Chapter 7 filing, and both types of filings are
reportable for up to 10 years.

The Reporting Issue

One way to enhance Chapter 13 would be to roll back the credit-reporting
period for a Chapter 13 filing while leaving Chapter 7 at 10 years.  If, for
example, Chapter 13 filings could only be reported up to six months after
discharge, it might be anticipated that many debtors would opt for Chapter 13
as the best way of rebuilding their credit.

The Chapter 13 option would be further enhanced if issuers were to adjust
their records upon receiving a Chapter 13 discharge to reflect a favorable
settlement.  They could also alter lending policies to provided that customers
who complete meaningful Chapter 13 plans would be considered for future credit
according to their individual circumstances, and not be denied credit
automatically because of a past Chapter 13 filing which affected the issuer.

With regard to post-bankruptcy credit, Chapter 13 trustees in Texas and Ohio
have had debtor-rehabilitation programs in effect for several years.  Under
these programs, debtors who successfully complete larger-percentage repayment
plans are considered on their merits for new credit by participating lenders.
The lenders do not promise new credit, but do agree to disregard the Chapter
13 filing, or to consider it as a favorable indicator of a debtor's
rehabilitation in evaluating a credit application.  The trustees report that
the program has successfully encouraged debtors to choose Chapter 13 over
Chapter 7.

A strong advantage of focusing upon enhancing Chapter 13 relief is that
legislative opposition presumably would be minimal because the proposals are
not restrictive, but rather offer debtors incentives to rehabilitate through
Chapter 13 on a voluntary basis.  This approach reflects compassion for those
who got in over their heads with credit, sometimes for reasons beyond their
control, but often due to an unsuccessful adjustment to the relatively new age
of convenient credit.  Surviving in this era requires self-discipline and
credit education, the lack of which is a problem that is societal in scope.

A Favorable Argument

In addition, as a foundation upon which to argue for legislative action, a
favorable argument can be made that the historically high ratio of Chapter 13
to Chapter 7 cases in most of the Southeast should be possible in the rest of
the country.  The Southeast, with the exception of Florida, traditionally has
had a larger ratio of Chapter 13 filings because, according to some area
bankruptcy professionals, conservative attitudes prevail in the largely rural
areas, and Chapter 7 exemptions in those states have been generally more
restrictive.

This does not mean that a tightening of Chapter 7 should be ignored.  On the
contrary, removing the subjective standard in many dischargeability contests
(the so-called intent to repay) with a more objective (reasonable ability to
repay) standard, would ease the difficult burden of proof now facing issuers
in many jurisdictions.

Going further, although strong opposition could be expected from the consumer
lobby, it could be proposed that all principal from debts incurred 90 days
before bankruptcy be automatically nondischargeable without the need to file a
dischargeability complaint.  Such an approach would have a foundation in other
Western countries' bankruptcy laws, which are generally far more conservative.

In sum, issuers' goals of decreased bankruptcy filings and enhanced recoveries
could be met, in part, through making Chapter 13 more attractive, which would
likely encounter little opposition, while also proposing tighter Chapter 7
dischargeability standards.

A Plan to Improve The Bankruptcy Law


* Make Chapter 13 more attractive to consumers by shortening the time negative
bankruptcy information will stay on their credit reports.  * Issuers should
consider more favorable treatment for debtors who choose Chapter 13 compared
with those who use Chapter 7.  * Change the subjective "intent to repay"
dischargeability standard in Chapter 7 cases to an objective "reasonable
ability to repay" standard.  * Make principal debts incurred within 90 days of
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing nondischargeable-in other words, the consumer
cannot escape responsibility for repayment.

Sorting Out the Mail


The mountain of mail coming from credit card issuers keeps rising to new
heights.  Card mailings are projected to have totaled 2.8 billion pieces in
1995, an 18.5% increase from a year earlier, according Tarrytown, N.Y.-based
Behavioral Analysis Inc.

In order to get a better read on which issuers are mailing the most and the
types of cards most frequently mailed, Faulkner & Gray Inc., publisher of
Credit Card Management, began tracking in April 1994 mailings to staffers in
its Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.  offices.  Details from the
solicitations were published monthly in CCM's sister publication, Credit Card
News.  Mailings collected through November 1995 totaled 1,077.

While the results of such a survey are not a statistically representative
sample of the entire industry, they do provide a road map of which issuers are
dominating mailings and the types of pricing strategies in play.

Top Mailers

Though issuers are mailing more than ever, the bulk of those mailings are
coming from a handful of issuers.  The top 10 issuers tracked in the survey
accounted for 56% of all offers received.  To no one's surprise, Citibank was
the top mailer with an 11.5% share, followed by Capital One Financial Corp.
with a 6.8% share, and First USA, at 6.5%.  Unexpectedly checking in fourth is
San Francisco-based Providian Bankcorp (formerly First Deposit), which ranks
22nd in receivables, with a 6.1% share.  MBNA rounds out the top five, with
4.9% share.

On the pricing side, annual fees remain alive, though they continue to lose
ground.  Overall, 27% of solicitations received had an annual fee.  A
breakdown of solicitations received for 1995 reveals that issuers are mailing
fewer solicitations with annual fees.  Just 26% of solicitations received in
1995 had annual fees, down from 29% in 1994.  And nearly all gold card offers
are promoted as non-fee cards, according to BAI.

Fixed interest rates are also disappearing from the landscape.  Variable rates
are now king.  Of the general purpose card offers received, 78% promoted a
permanent variable rate, and 29% offered a variable teaser rate pegged to the
prime rate, LIBOR, or some other floating measure.

Teaser rates virtually have become a prerequisite for card mailings, as 82% of
solicitations offered either a fixed-rate or variable rate teaser.  The split
on the duration of the teasers was fairly even:  48% pitched teasers for six
months or less, while 52% offered teasers for more than six months.

As for the types of cards being mailed, gold cards were the dominant subset,
netting 52% of bank card mailings received.  BAI reports that gold cards
represented 48% of bank card mailings during the second quarter of 1995.
Cobranded cards accounted for 15% of all CCN's bank card mailings.  Cobranded
cards totaled 20% of bank card mailings during the second quarter, according
to BAI.

MasterCard International still leads the cobranding derby.  Cobranded
MasterCards represented 65% of cobranded card mailings that did not offer
consumers a choice of brand, compared with 35% for Visa.

Among cobranded partners, AT&T's Universal Card lead the way, accounting for
22% of cobranded card mailings.  American Airlines' AAdvantage card was second
with a 17% share of mailings, and the Shell MasterCard placed third with a 12%
share.

Given the volume of mail, Faulkner & Gray intends to monitor card offers even
more closely in the future.  Which issuers will be the biggest mailers in 1996
and what types of offers will consumers see?  Stay tuned.

An End Run By Fraudsters


When it comes to the war on fraud, the credit card industry has been so
focused on developing new technologies, such as smart cards, to foil con
artists that they may have forgotten to scrutinize the legal loopholes and
their own business practices for potential weaknesses that swindlers can
exploit.

Indeed, the indictment last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles of 20
Vietnamese immigrants for bank fraud has exposed a serious flaw in the
Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1988, in addition to possible flaws in how
card issuers govern their own organizations.

The type of fraud perpetrated is a so-called booster-check scheme in which the
suspects allegedly wrote checks from accounts with insufficient funds to boost
their credit limits, then made cash advances and expensive purchases with the
cards before the checks were rejected by the banks.  After the credit burden
became too great, the defendants allegedly declared bankruptcy.

The scheme defrauded issuers nationwide of more than $40 million, and more
arrests are expected.  Similar ploys could cost issuers as much as $100
million, says Assistant U.S.  Attorney Marc R.  Greenberg.  That's about 14%
of the $734 million in bank card fraud in 1994.  Investigators have subpoenaed
the records from 150 credit card issuers, including Chase Manhattan Corp.,
AT&T Universal Card Services, Banc One, and Bank of America.

The case raises concerns that changes need to be made to the Expedited Funds
Availability Act of 1988, which requires banks and issuers to post a check and
credit the funds as soon as the check is received, rather than waiting for it
to clear.

Prosecutors claim loopholes in the law enabled the suspects to withdraw large
cash advances or buy big-ticket items with the cards after mailing to their
card issuing banks bogus checks to boost their credit limits.  Some defendants
allegedly sent five checks of $5,000 each to one issuer in a week, then spent
the entire amount before the first check was cleared or rejected by the bank,
Greenberg says.

After the defendants depleted all available credit on their cards, they would
file bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy court records reveal each cardholder has from
$100,000 to $685,000 in unsecured credit card debt.  "The law requires issuers
to open the line of credit as soon as the check is received," says Joel S.
Lisker, MasterCard International Senior Vice President of Security and Risk
Management.  "This is a foolish thing to do."

Sharing the Blame

Responding to fraud concerns, the Federal Reserve Board plans to survey banks
on the extent of check fraud losses caused by the Expedited Funds Availability
Act.  The six-page survey should begin arriving at financial institutions
around mid-February.

But the case is also drawing attention to card issuers own short- comings in
the fraud battle.  Fraud experts argue that competition and complacency have
prompted issuers to write off booster check fraud as a collection issue
instead of fraud, overlook red flags that suggest fraud, and make cards too
easy to obtain.  One suspect had five MasterCards from one bank, each one with
a maxed out credit limit, says Greenberg.

Adds Everett Whatley, president of Raleigh, N.C.-based Card Risk Management
Global:  "Competition makes issuers less sensitive to fraud and
creditworthiness.  They should not allow checks to boost a credit line.  If a
large check is received, they should ensure the funds are in the bank account
the check is written from before posting it."

That's a logical solution, but will issuers heed the advice?

I'll Trade You My Portfolio...


Card executives who were savvy traders of baseball cards during their youth
may want to brush up those skills.  The concept of acquiring credit card
accounts via a straight-up trade for accounts of equal value is being
considered as a low-cost alternative to buying portfolios.

Indeed, with fewer portfolios on the block and escalating premiums, portfolio
trading makes good sense.  After all, issuers can rid themselves of accounts
that don't fit the makeup of their portfolio, such as affinity cards that were
acquired via a merger, by trading for accounts more in line with their
business, such as those in their home market.

Confused?  Don't be.  "The idea is to trade away accounts that are more
valuable to another issuer in exchange for accounts that are more valuable to
you," explains Michael J.  Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group,
Westbury, N.Y., which is broaching the idea to clients.

Let's Make a Deal

That's certainly an attractive proposition in an era when banks are under
increasing pressure to grow assets.  But completing an equitable trade is not
an easy task, warns to Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Co., a
Newbury Park, Calif.-based consulting firm specializing in portfolio sales.
"I was involved in two attempted trades back in the 1980s, and both times the
deal fell through because one side always felt their portfolio was worth more
than the other portfolio," Hammer recalls.

Just how feasible is portfolio trading?  Auriemma argues that with banks being
pushed by investors to grow assets, issuers will start to give serious
consideration to the concept because the money saved by not paying a premium
to buy a coveted block of accounts can be put toward card marketing.

But before issuers rush off to make the trade of a lifetime, they had best
check with their accounting departments about the cost of adding those
accounts to the portfolio.  Issuers thinking of trading portfolios ought to
ask themselves the following questions before pulling the trigger on a trade,
cautions one Wall Street analyst:  Can the acquisition costs associated with
those accounts still be be amortized?  Will the accounts acquired in a trade
be more expensive to service than those traded away?  And will the acquired
accounts be more profitable than those traded away?  "There are a lot
accounting issues that must be addressed," the analyst adds.

Card experts agree that portfolio trading can be pulled off if the parties
involved price their portfolios equitably.  "Portfolio trading is such an
attractive option, any prudent issuer will look at it," says Hammer.  Who
knows, maybe one day credit card executives may trade card portfolios as
easily as they traded, when they were kids, a baseball card of Mickey Mantle
for one of Willie Mays.

Cutting Up Commercial Cards


For years, card marketers have successfully sliced and diced the consumer card
market into thinner segments by creating products that cater to specific
cardholder needs.  But when it comes to commercial cards, there has been
little segmentation.

Sure, issuers have created purchasing cards and cards targeted at small
businesses that offer a revolving line of credit, but those are basic
segmentation techniques, much like standard and gold cards.  Consequently, few
of the high-powered segmentation techniques learned in the consumer market
have been applied to commercial cards.

That's because corporations and businesses have historically looked to card
programs to lower their operating expenses first.  Cardholder perks are
considered a frivolous expense that raise the cost of the card program.

But that attitude is changing.  American Express Co.'s launch of a platinum
corporate card last October signals that small-business executives, at which
the card is targeted, are demanding more consumer card perks from commercial
card issuers.

Catering to Needs

The reason:  small-business executives tend to be less sensitive to the cost
of a commercial card program than large corporations, says Fred O.  Gumbel,
president of the electronic commerce division for Electronic Data Systems.
"Small businesses are more willing to accept perks on commercial cards than
large corporations even though those benefits may be built in to the price of
the card," says Gumbel, who headed First Bank Systems' corporate card
portfolio before moving to EDS in 1994.

AmEx, which says its small-business customers asked for more perks, answered
the call with its platinum corporate card.  The card charges a $300 annual fee
and $150 for additional cards.  Cardholders receive free companion tickets
when they buy a full-fare, first-class or business-class airline ticket; free
enrollment in AmEx's Membership Rewards program; free room upgrades,
continental breakfast for two, and late checkout at participating hotels; and
confirmed restaurant reservations.

Now that AmEx is applying segmentation techniques learned in the consumer
market to commercial cards, will bank card issuers follow?  The answer is yes.
"There are bank card issuers interested in marketing a cobranded commercial
card," declares Peter L.  Williamson, managing director of Stamford,
Conn.-based Salestrac USA Inc.

So coveted are some consumer card perks that small-business owners are paying
for business expenses with consumer cards.  "The right rewards are a big plus
for small businesses," says Williamson.  Perks small-business commercial card
holders may see are frequent-flier miles, car-rental and gasoline discounts.
"Segmentation is becoming more important in corporate card marketing," says
Dorsey R.  Grant, AmEx's vice president of customer loyalty, small-business
services.  "Whether it's data reporting or cardholder perks, commercial
cardholders have specialized needs."

Risk-Based Repricing Draws Flak


On cyberspace chat lines and consumer-rights phone lines, Capital One
Financial Corp.  is drawing heat for the policy it calls risk-based repricing
and consumer advocates say is just unfair.

Since last spring, a couple of dozen consumers have contacted Bankcard Holders
of America to complain about Capital One's strategy of altering interest rates
on existing customers' credit lines when periodic credit-report reviews reveal
customers have been issued other credit cards, have assumed new debt, or have
otherwise altered their credit profile.

"That's not a huge number, but the ones we hear from are irate," reports Ruth
Susswein, BHA's executive director.  "They're being bumped from 12.9% to
24.9%.  If they're a poor credit risk, I don't see how a rate hike is solving
the problem."

Syndicated columnist Jane Bryant Quinn also took Capital One to task for
sharply higher rate hikes and the "gobbledygook" explanations given to
consumers for the adverse action.  Quinn cited the case of a fireman whose
interest rate went from 13.9% to 24.96% despite timely payments.  She
suggested bank regulators should scrutinize the practice.

BHA also has been critical of other issuers for what it terms penalty rates,
citing Citibank and AT&T Universal for higher late fees and rates for
cardholders who fail to uphold their credit agreement.  But Susswein notes the
concept of increasing rates for existing customers on the basis of credit
reviews of other trade lines is different, and she suspects Capital One isn't
the only issuer doing it.

Capital One President Nigel W.  Morris defends the strategy and predicts most
issuers will eventually follow suit.  He says the practice of both raising and
lowering rates "on a selective basis" has been done by the former Signet card
center since 1989.

"Down the road, the credit card business will look more like the insurance
business, with pricing based on likely outcomes instead of one price for
everybody," Morris says.  "Knowing who to do it to and when to do it is
critical."

Whether a trend will develop toward risk-based instead of performance-based
repricing is open to debate.  One issuer who requested anonymity says higher
rates based on poor credit behavior "makes good business sense," but changing
rates or fees for existing customers because they are assuming debt with
another lender amounts to "preying on the laziness of the American public,"
cardholders who stick with higher-rate cards simply because they don't bother
to find better deals.

Tapping the Ethnic Market


Card issuers looking to tap the expanding Hispanic market ought to keep an eye
on Key Federal Savings Bank's new secured Hispanic affinity card.

Key Federal, which is partnering with Texas-based SER, a renowned and
respected national nonprofit organization dedicated to creating education,
literacy, employment, and job-skills programs for Hispanics, is betting the
card will be a hit in a market in which affinity cards tend to flop.  "We
think SER will give us an edge in attracting the uncarded Hispanics," says
Robert M.  Bouza, Havre de Grace, Md.-based Key Federal chief credit officer.
"SER's programs reach a large portion of our target audience."

But some Hispanic affinity card issuers argue Key Federal faces a tough sell.
"Many Hispanics without cards prefer cash," says Patti D.W.  McCoy, a senior
vice president with First Consumers National Bank, issuer of Adelante affinity
card for Hispanics.  "There is a huge difference between potential and
reality."

Time will tell.
