<h3>
Why I Choose to Be Disabled</h3>
<p>
<b><i>By William G. Stothers</i></b>
<p>

When I first acquired my disability, at the age of 10, I chose not
to be disabled. I did not want to be disabled. I didn't want to be
shuttled through hospitals and tortuous rehab programs. I wanted to
go home, ride my bike through the countryside, explore the woods
and follow the little creeks around town, go swimming or try to
catch the fish. I hated being disabled.
<p>
That didn't change after I returned home. I was the only kid with
a severe disability around my area. My friends got on with their
lives without me. Unable to play with them, or keep up with them,
I was left behind, at home.
<p>
In some ways, I didn't mind. While I was angry and hurt that I
wasn't a part of the gang anymore, I also was glad that I didn't
have to expose my crippled self to them. I was ashamed of my
disabled body.
<p>
And I was angry at it for not working like it used to. Boy, did I
ever feel sorry for myself. Why me? I wanted to know. I didn't
deserve this.<i> Somebody fix it</i>!
<p>
Nobody did, of course. They developed a vaccine to prevent polio,
which had caused my disability, but the vaccine would not cure me.
What I had was what I had. Over time I built a shell to hide the
hurt.
<p>
Outwardly, I went to school, college and entered the workforce. I
got along, but I never really got close to anyone. I hated people
patronizing me and feeling sorry for me -- at the same time that I
was feeling far more sorry for myself than anyone one would, or
could.
<p>
What a mess I was. I did not deny my disability so much as I
devalued and rejected it. I tried very hard to be non-disabled. I
never looked at other people with disabilities, let alone associate
with them. I wasn't like them. I made jokes about my wheelchair and
accommodations I needed, and endured those "heh-heh" comments from
others about going too fast and breaking the speed limit. It was
all very detached, and I was wound pretty tight.
<p>
Maintaining the contradictions of such an existence was not easy.
For me, drinking made it easier, even as it caused its own serious
problems.
<p>
I can't pinpoint when I began to change, although it was around the
time I met another person in a wheelchair. His name was also Bill
and he lived in the same apartment building as I did. We
encountered one another over time and gradually became friends. We
discovered that we had had similar experiences as wheelchair users.
Ultimately, we talked a great deal about those experiences and
about disability. Our friendship went beyond disability, but
disability added a richness and texture to it. In time, we got
involved with some other people with disabilities and found
ourselves becoming disability activists.
<p>
We found a community. Here, disability was a common bond, not
something to be rejected. We all, I think, found strength and
support. We were not all necessarily friends. But we valued one
another.
<p>
I didn't realize it fully at the time þ this was in the early 1970s
þ but it was in that small community of persons with disabilities
that I first chose to be disabled. I chose to be part of the group
because I saw myself reflected in them. At last, I acknowledged my
self.
<p>
The group was called ALPHA, and for me it was a beginning. In
choosing to be a part of this group I began to stop rejecting my
disability. Instead I began to incorporated my disability into my
conception of myself.
<p>
From being rejected as abnormal, disability for me became normal.
And so it is. All you have to do is look around. Disability is
everywhere and touches almost everyone's life. It is a normal
expression of life, a natural part of life.
<p>
Adopting that perspective brought me a peace I had not known. I
began to feel a sense of wholeness that I had not experienced
before.
<p>
And I was taken with new energy and passion. Not overnight, I
hasten to add. The change took time, and more than a bottle or two.
But change I did.
<p>
Today, great numbers of individuals with disabilities believe that
disability is normal. We're working hard to spread that news. But
countless others, both disabled and non-disabled, have not yet
heard. That's the passion of the disability rights movement: to
expand our knowledge of life to include and respect disability, to
include people with disabilities equally, as the normal people we
are. What's your choice?
