name="The Big Picture"><b>The Big Picture</b></a></h1>

<p>When I was first learning to drive, a bus driver friend said,
&#147;Always Watch the Big Picture.&#148; By this he meant that
when driving we must be aware of what is ahead of us on the road
both short and long range, what is beside us and may run across
the road, and what is coming up behind us to cause us trouble. </p>

<p>The same is true of the stock market. We must be aware of long
and short term trends, events happening around the world that may
impact our investments and what things may be sneaking up behind
us. Having grown up on Long Island, New York, I often think of
the stock market as a giant traffic jam. Everyone is trying to
get ahead as fast as possible. Obviously, the best approach is to
find the fastest moving lane and get in it. But as those of you
who have spent any time in traffic know, the fastest moving lane
may change a mile up the road so we must be prepared. Those tuned
into the traffic helicopter are the best prepared. </p>

<p>At Financial Trend Forecaster we feel our job is to be the
helicopter to help keep you informed of &#147;The Big
Picture&#148;. That is why we include such diverse things as
Currencies, Gold, Bonds, Inflation, large capitalization stocks
(NYSE) and smaller stocks (NASDAQ) and various ways of looking at
each including Relative Strength and Moving Averages. </p>

<p>If we understand the overall scheme of things and know that
&#147;<i>x</i>&#148; should happen and how to profit when it
does, then we just patiently wait for our opportunity to profit.
Patience is rewarded perhaps because it is so difficult to
possess. It has been said that developing a system and doggedly
sticking to it is one of the best ways to profit in the stock
market. Unfortunately, this is not the glamorous type of
investing many market participants are looking for. They want hot
tips and fancy stocks with good stories. But if you want
profit&#151;following the boring system month in and month out is
the best way to get it. </p>

<p>The only other necessary ingredient is to avoid loss. One of
America's all time best investors Warren Buffett has one rule:
&#147;Never Lose Money.&#148; That may sound simplistic but it is
not so simple to put into practice. </p>

<p>How, you might ask, can we always avoid loss? Unfortunately,
very few have mastered the technique of never taking a loss, if
they had they could be as rich as Mr. Buffett. There are,
however, several steps we can take: </p>

<ol>
    <li><i>Don't get caught up in emotion</i>. Logically analyze
        the market and invest where the risks are smallest and
        the rewards are greatest (<i>i.e</i>., where the
        risk/reward ratio is greatest) </li>
    <li><i>Always exit the market early</i>. Experts like Mr.
        Buffett often leave the market well before the top. By
        getting in within 10% of the bottom and getting out 10%
        before the top they take their 80% out of the middle! By
        doing this they avoid the high risk areas and preserve
        their capital for the next buying opportunity. Also,
        psychologically speaking, by avoiding the loss they are
        less &#147;gun shy&#148; about jumping back in when
        everyone else is devastated because they lost their shirt
        and want nothing to do with the market. This is easier
        said than done. At market tops everything is roses and
        why get out when things have been so good? </li>
</ol>

<p>3) <i>Have preset statistical models to base your actions on,
so you don't rely upon emotion</i>. A good example is our moving
average. When the average says it is time to exit, do it! This
way we may leave a bit on the table but we haven't taken a loss.
Some investors believe that leaving something behind is the same
as taking a loss (<i>i.e</i>., they didn't get out at the top so
they made a mistake). This is a very dangerous philosophy because
it causes us to overstay our welcome and usually involves a
bigger loss in the long run. No one can be exactly right every
time so it is better to err on the side of caution. Markets often
lose gains that took years to accumulate in months or even weeks.
So, a short delay in exiting often means the difference between a
gain and a loss. </p>

<h2><a href="#In This Issue . . ."><b><img

name="Signs of a Top">Signs of a Top</a></h2>

<p>Now that we know what we should be doing when the &#147;Big
Picture&#148; indicates a top is at hand, what are the road signs
of an impending top? There are several and some are quite vague
including the &#147;feel&#148; of a top. What does a top feel
like? </p>

<ol>
    <li>New investors have come out of the woodwork. People who
        have never invested before think they can get rich by
        following their broker's advice. (Remember if that were
        true your broker would be getting rich off the market
        rather than off commissions.) </li>
    <li>TV Commercials refer to the stock market off handedly as
        the way to get rich. </li>
    <li>The kid who mows your lawn and the cashier at the grocery
        store have a broker. </li>
    <li>&#147;Everyone&#148; knows the market goes up and the
        unthinkable is a 10% decline. </li>
    <li>Investment newsletters proliferate. </li>
    <li>Multitudes of companies without a single product on the
        market yet are having IPO's (initial public stock
        offerings) that make new millionaires of their
        Presidents/CEOs. (<i>e.g.</i> Internet stocks). </li>
</ol>

<p>Based upon these criteria I have seen 5 of the above in the
last couple of months, only #3 is lacking but I have heard of
similar occurrences. </p>

<p>More concrete signs of tops are: 1) increased volatility, 2)
increased daily volume, 3) crossing down through the moving
averages, 4) long periods with the Relative Strength index above
or well above the overbought line followed by dips down through
the overbought line, 5) Markets not reaching old highs, etc. </p>

<p>Taken as a whole these signs, both concrete and based upon
&#147;feel&#148;, indicate that we may very well be within 10% of
the top. I have begun taking some chips off the table in my
personal portfolios. </p>

<p>Those positions that have not performed well during a strong
bull market probably will not do better as the market weakens
(unless they were chosen as insurance against market weakness).
It is probably a good time to review your portfolio and begin
cleaning house. Selling poor performers into whatever strength
remains is much better than selling into weakness as the market
begins declining. </p>

<p>What to do with our winners is more difficult. Since the NYSE
index has crossed back up through its 6 month moving average we
have an indication of increased volatility but not a clear sell
signal. This, however, is a warning signal which usually occurs
within 10% of the top, so cautious investors may want to consider
selling some of the winners, too. Selling half of any winners
that have doubled would be prudent at this point. We do not have
an all out sell signal yet but caution is definitely warranted. </p>

<p>Fortunately, our gold/ bond ratio will continue to oscillate
without regard to what the stock market is doing so we must
continue to watch for the switch point. </p>

<p>The Gold Relative Strength index has made progressively higher
lows, from below oversold in June to just touching oversold in
July to just below midpoint in August. These are definitely
signals of building strength and as I have said on the Hotline
since early July it may be prudent to begin phasing into gold </p>

<p>Bonds are showing weakness with the most recent up move not
even crossing the over bought line. Peak &#147;B&#148; looks
ominously similar to the first half of peak &#147;A&#148; except
it occurred below the line rather than above it. To get a good
sell signal we should have a move above the over bought line,
although a really weak market could end without it. </p>

<p><img src="../images/GvsB896.gif" width="640" height="437"></p>

<p>The Gold vs. Bond ratio has moved up sharply this week
indicating Gold has been out performing Bonds recently. During
the prior month however, the ratio has been flat within the range
I mentioned last month as the most common range for reversals.
The recent uptick is primarily a result of the recently released
CPI data. This, however, has resulted in the ratio crossing
upward through its 4 week moving average (see circle
&#147;A&#148;). It has also been strong enough to cross upward
through its 8 week moving average. <b>Technically, we have a buy
signal for Gold. </b>So both the ratio and RSI favors a switch to
Gold at this point. However, this causes a dilemma since the MIP
is predicting a down turn next month. </p>

name="The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP)">The Moore Inflation
Predictor (MIP)</a></h2>

<p>Last month's most likely line was right on the nose with the
most recent inflation rate coming in at 2.95%, not the
government's rounded 3%. As we said last month the numbers almost
had to go up since a zero was falling out of the calculation. The
market, however, does not understand this statistical anomaly and
has taken this increase as a confirmation that inflation is
increasing and an excuse to buy Gold. As we can see from the
chart, though, the next three months will most likely be down
with the highest extreme being basically flat. <b>This should
provide an opportunity to get into Gold at cheaper prices than
those currently available.</b> The up move following this decline
looks fairly steep at this point but short lived. </p>

<p><img src="../images/mip896.gif" width="512" height="350"> </p>

<p>The MIP is primarily a long term predictive (leading)
indicator while the RSI is a short term predictor and the ratio
is based exclusively on prior events and is therefore a lagging
indicator. </p>

<p>Normally, what that would mean is that the MIP would signal a
change in direction, which would later be confirmed by the RSI
and finally by the Ratio moving average. What has happened this
past month, however, is that a short up move was predicted by the
MIP confirmed by the RSI and finally by the Moving average. So
far everything is as expected. But since the up move was of such
short duration the MIP is now predicting a down move which
&#147;should&#148; be followed by confirmation in the Moving
average (probably looking much like a whipsaw). However the RSI
may be indicating the overall building strength which will
culminate in the Gold up move later this year. </p>

<p>What does all this mean for our investments? Well, a strict
technician would follow the moving average and RSI indicators and
switch into Gold and take a chance on being whipsawed out. </p>

<p>A gambler would hold out hoping the coming drop would wipe out
the gains that Gold is currently making and provide a better
entry point (which is a distinct possibility). But I believe a
rational cautious individual would begin phasing funds into Gold
using some sort of cost averaging system. </p>

<p>Since we are looking at a flat period of 3 to 4 months (which
may see Bonds moving primarily sideways anyway) you may divide
your bond holdings at this point into four parts and move ¼ into
Gold Funds now and ¼ in each of the next three months on
declines in the price of Gold. This way you should get in at a
fairly good average price. </p>

<p><img src="../images/PandS896.gif" width="640" height="437"></p>

<p>Since we are considering moving back into Metals we need to
look at the ratio of Gold to Platinum and also to Silver. As we
can see here Platinum is undervalued compared to Gold, while
silver is overvalued (and has been for a couple of years). But
Silver is not as closely linked to Gold as Platinum so the ratio
is not as reliable. Based upon this chart we probably want to
have a portion of our funds in Platinum to get a little extra
bang for our buck. As it returns to more normal valuations it
should appreciate a bit faster than Gold. Similarly, we would
want to avoid Silver Stocks as they should under perform Gold. </p>

<p>The NYSE Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering
around the 60% mark for the entire month of August. The market
has not been showing much strength although it has regained about
2/3 of last month's loss but it has met a lot of resistance. The
NYSE briefly crossed below both its 4 week and 6 month moving
average and was even confirmed by the 4 week crossing down
through the 6 month but as we can see in the circle it has
crossed back up through both in typical whipsaw fashion. The
increase in volatility that this whipsaw indicates along with the
flattening of the 6 month average indicates that the end is
probably near and we should begin looking to the exits as
mentioned in the lead article. </p>

<p>As our proxy for all Energy Stocks, Fidelity is looking a bit
weak with what looks like the start of a peak at point
&#147;A&#148; being lower than point &#147;B&#148;. Also if
&#147;A&#148; is peaking below the overbought line we aren't
seeing much strength here so the only hope for energy stocks is
the rumored war Clinton is going to start with Iran to get
reelected. It sounds like a long shot but time will tell. If a
war does materialize it would also be good for Gold and bad for
the Stock market. At this point it is only a rumor but it pays to
factor the possibility into the &#147;big picture.&#148; </p>

<p>The very deep plunge in the health RSI last month is still
scary. Usually, a plunge of that depth will be followed by
several more tests of the oversold line with the price of the
fund reaching lower lows with every test. The sideways movement
at midpoint rather than a strong move to the upside as in May of
95 also suggests weakness. </p>

<p>Both Transports and Electronics are showing the same type
pattern as Health as is the entire NASDAQ but their plunges in
July were not quite as weak. as health. Due to space limitations
we will only show Transports but if you note the similarity with
health you will see the unfolding pattern that is beginning to

<p>The Dollar Relative Strength Index also bottomed in July not
quite as badly as the stock markets but significantly enough for
concern about the greenback's safety in the coming months. You
will note the decided downtrend in both the Dollar index and the
RSI. I believe caution is also warranted in the Dollar. </p>
