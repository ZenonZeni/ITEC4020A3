<p><i>Santa Barbara, CA, June 25, 1996 -- </i>Computer Motion, the world’s leading supplier of 
medical robotics, announced the FDA has granted 510(k) market clearance for AESOP 2000 
(pronounced “eesop”), a surgical robot capable of maneuvering and positioning a laparoscope 
in response to a surgeon’s voice commands.  This allows the surgeon to use spoken English to 
precisely control and position the laparoscope (a specially designed optical tube which, when 
connected to a medical video camera and light source, is passed into the body to allow the 
surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor).<br>
</p>
<p>A clinical advisory team comprised of leading endoscopic surgeons has worked closely with 
the company throughout the development of the surgical robot’s voice control interface.  
These surgeons will be the first in the world to evaluate AESOP 2000 (an acronym for Automated 
Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) at their institutions.<br>

<p>“AESOP 2000 is the first voice controlled medical robot to be cleared by the FDA for the 
operating room,” said Gene Wang, President and CEO of Computer Motion.  “We are delighted 
with the FDA’s efforts to streamline the regulatory review process.  This is resulting in the 
timely introduction of safe and effective medical innovations that benefit the patient, 
surgeon and hospital.”<br>
</p>
<p>Computer Motion’s core development team, led by Chief Technical Officer and Founder, 
Dr. Yulun Wang, has worked together for over ten years and holds several key patents in 
robotics for medical applications.  The company is currently developing new products for 
surgical applications which leverage the core technologies underlying the AESOP family of 
products.<br>
</p>
<p>“The introduction of voice control marks a new paradigm for the way surgery will be 
performed in the near future,” said Dr. Yulun Wang, CTO and Founder of Computer Motion. 
 “Hospitals everywhere recognize that operating rooms need to become more efficient and 
less costly to operate.  We will apply our speech recognition technology to help optimize 
the operating room through a universal surgeon-to-machine interface.”<br>
</p>
<p>Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics.  The company’s 
mission is to enhance surgeons’ capabilities and improve outcomes while reducing costs in the 
operating room using computers and robotics.  Computer Motion is privately held and is based 
in Goleta, California. The company’s website is http://www.ComputerMotion.com.<br>
