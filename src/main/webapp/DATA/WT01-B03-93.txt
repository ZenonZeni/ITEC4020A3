<H3>  <IMG SRC="image1.gif" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="bottom">Our next general enrollment Tribal Gaming Academy program will be held in Coachella, California from Monday, February 3 thru Saturday,
 February 8, 1997.  Coachella is very close to Palm Springs.<BR><BR>
The six-day "Gaming Regulator Orientation" is our most popular program. Newly formatted, the February program will feature
 expanded coverage of Title 31 reporting and licensing background investigations.  The backgrounding presentation
 will include vendor & employee investigations, and tips on working with the National Indian Gaming Commission and the FBI.<BR><BR>
Student workbooks will be provided as both (1) an aid to class room note taking, and (2) as future reference tools. <BR><BR>
Representatives of any tribe or nation may attend as long as they are sponsored by the Governing Body or Gaming Commission of a federally
 recognized tribe or nation. Exceptions may be requested in writing.<BR><BR>
Contact us by E-mail, or phone (800-275-3918) for details.<BR>   <BR>
