<B>Project Title: Hybrid Electric Vehicle with Rotapower APU<p>
Performing Organization: Moller International</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Paul Moller  (916) 756-5086
</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>In this project, Moller International will develop a very low-emission rotary engine, and will integrate it into a hybrid electric vehicle.  This vehicle will then be tested under laboratory and field conditions, to determine if the target goals of more than 70 mpg and equivalent zero-emission vehicle emissions are met.</P>

	<P>Moller International has developed a very powerful and small rotary engine, which produces 15 hp on a continuous basis and a maximum of 30 hp, and which is less than one cubic foot in size -- minus the exhaust system.  This engine will be integrated into an electric Geo Metro (the Solectria Force), and the existing battery pack will be replaced with a high-rate hybrid battery system, designed to provide peak power requirements.  This design allows the battery pack to be reduced by 500 lbs., lowering the vehicle weight from 2390 lbs. to approximately 1900 lbs. (similar to the original Geo Metro).  These modifications will allow performance to significantly improve, giving acceleration rates of 0-60 mph in 12 seconds and a range of over 250 miles.</P>

	<P>The project will provide a comparison between the performance characteristics of three different vehicles, all built on the same platform, but using different energy sources.
</P>
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>This program is just beginning, and will last for twelve months.  The APU will be designed and fabricated by the sixth month of the project, and will be fully integrated into the hybrid vehicle by month nine.  Three months of laboratory and road testing will then complete the project.</P>
