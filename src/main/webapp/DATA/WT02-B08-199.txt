<b>The Director, Dr John Heap,</b> writes:<BR>
<br>
The Appointments Committee met on 9 October 1996 and confirmed the 
Selection Committee's choice of <br>

<b>Dr. Neil Arnold</b>. Neil read Geography and went on to do his PhD
here. After a spell as Research Associate in the Geography Department in
the University of Cambridge, he went for one year to Garry Clarke's
Department of Geophysics and Astronomy at the University of British
Colombia. Neil interests are within the broad field of environmental
modelling, particularly the interactions between ice masses, climate and
glacier hydrology. He has developed mathematical models of these
interactions. 
<p> 
Terrestrial glaciology has a long history in the Institute associated 
with Gordon Robin, David Drewry and Julian Dowdeswell. By taking us into 
the fields of glacier hydrology and the
modelling of ice sheets and glaciers at different scales and time spans, I
am greatly looking forward to Neil carrying on, and adding lustre to, that
tradition".
