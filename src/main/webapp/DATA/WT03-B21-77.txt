<P>

Here at Cabot we are always searching for Heritage Stocks. These
are stocks that can remain in your portfolio as long as they can
continue to grow. . . . . sometimes for years. There are two basic
advantages of cultivating Heritage Stocks. First, you take advantage
of the eighth wonder of the world: the compounding of your profits.
This can produce wondrous results if you but let the compounding
do its job and work for you over the years. Second, there is no
greater tax haven than unrealized appreciation in soundly growing
companies. Imagine being able to postpone taxation on your profits
for years on end!
<P>
Here are Cabot's Criteria for these special kinds of stocks:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>It's a small company, with sales between $20 million and $500 million.
<LI>It has a revolutionary product or service with a major benefit.
<LI>It has high barriers to competition, such as patents or market dominance.
<LI>It has large recurring income from disposable products or services.
<LI>It has excellent, innovative management.
<LI>It has no debt or little debt.
<LI>It has huge mass markets.
<LI>It has strong positive momentum.
<LI>It has growing sales and earnings.
<LI>It has substantial ownership by management.
</OL>

<P>
If you are fortunate enough to own a stock that doubles in value,
you have a 100% profit. If you sit tight and it doubles again,
you have a 300% profit. And, if it doubles again, you have a 700%
profit. If the stock then doubles again, you have a 1500% profit.
Impossible? Not at all. All you need is a good, well-managed company.....and
time.
<H4>What is a Heritage Stock?</H4>

<P>
It's a stock in which you have at least doubled your money . .
. . .and in which the potential for profits from continued investment
remains very large. That's all.
<H4>What can a Heritage Stock do for me? </H4>

<P>
It can make you rich . . . . .through the wonderful &quot;magic&quot;
of compound growth. It can give you peace of mind, by taking you
out of the frantic world of the short-term trader/investor and
moving you into the calm world of the patient, long-term investor.
And it can help you postpone taxes. Because every year that you
don't sell that big winner is another year the mushrooming profits
can compound and the tax man has to wait.
<H4>How do I find a Heritage Stock?</H4>

<P>
You find a potential Heritage Stock using Cabot's Criteria . .
. . .and attempt to grow your profits beyond the 100% level. Only
then can you consider labeling it a Heritage Stock.
<H4>Should I buy more of my Heritage Stock?</H4>

<P>
Buy it again and again, time after time . . . . .ideally, you
want to buy more at the bottom of market corrections.
<H4>When do I sell my Heritage Stock? </H4>

<P>
In a well-established, mature company that has historically demonstrated
strong relative performance and regular earnings growth, you should
sell when the RP line (Cabot Criteria #8) deteriorates significantly.
Normally, this will be soon followed by poorer earnings growth.
But in a young, fast-developing company with a ragged history
of earnings growth and an alternately hot and cold relative strength,
the time to sell is when fundamental factors appear to diminish
the prospects for future earnings growth. In any case, we urge
you to give your Heritage Stock plenty of leeway. And here's why.
When you sell, you're betting that even after you pay your taxes
you can replace your Heritage Stock with a stock that's better.
<H4>What are today's potential Heritage Stocks? </H4>

<P>
Cabot prefers small companies. They all have the potential to
multiply their sales and earnings many times over. And they all
provide you with the opportunity to benefit from the unforeseeable
and the incalculable. When you put your money in a well-managed
company in a growth industry and then let things take their course,
you put yourself in the position to benefit from that future.
And even though you cannot foresee it, and even though you cannot
calculate it, it can reward you mightily.
