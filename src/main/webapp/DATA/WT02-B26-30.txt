<H2>Progress In Schizophrenia Genetics: Several Studies Point To Chromosome</H2></center>

 <HR>

	Data from several studies published in the November 1995 issue of Nature Genetics pinpoint the location of a gene involved in schizophrenia.  Using three independent data sets--including more than 380 families in 10 countries--scientists provide evidence that a region of chromosome 6 carries a gene involved in schizophrenia.  This statistically significant finding builds on a large body of evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies, showing that schizophrenia has a genetic component. It signals real scientific progress and an ever-increasing understanding of the biology of this severely disabling brain disorder.  
<P>
	These findings, while strong, do not eradicate the complexities of schizophrenia genetics.  A specific gene on chromosome 6 has not been identified.  And three other studies reported in the same issue of Nature Genetics failed to detect any linkage between the region of chromosome 6 found by the other research groups and schizophrenia.  In one of the studies, which positively identified chromosome 6, four other chromosomal regions were identified as well.    
<P>
	The slow progress in the molecular genetics of schizophrenia does not reflect a lack of evidence that genes play a role in this brain disorder, but rather the complexities of schizophrenia in terms of its diagnosis, relationship to other diseases, the likely involvement of more than one gene and different genes in different families, and the undoubtable role of nongenetic factors.  
<P>
	So, complications and complexities of schizophrenia genetics still exist.  Further study will be required to reconfirm the chromosome 6 location as well as other chromosome locations involved in schizophrenia and to identity specific genes in this brain disorder.  But for all of the complexities, scientists have produced the best data to date showing a linkage between a chromosome region and schizophrenia. 
<P>
	NOTE:  The "Ask the Doctor" section of the January/February issue of the Advocate will provide more information about schizophrenia genetics and gene searches.
