<HR>
<H2><B>RESOURCE CURRICULUM</B></H2>
<P>
It is important that today's students understand what nuclear
waste is and how it can be disposed of safely. The Science, Society,
and America's Nuclear Waste resource curriculum, produced by the
U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management (OCRWM), assists educators by providing educational
materials that encourage hands-on, real-world experiences significant
to today's students.
<P>
The resource curriculum, designed for use in grades 8-12, contains
materials for both students and teachers. Student materials include
readings, review exercises, and activities. For teachers, supplemental
teaching aids include videotapes, computer software, and viewgraphs.
<P>
<I>Science, Society, and America's Nuclear Waste </I>is modular
and flexible. There are four units, each with a core of basic
information supplemented by enrichment readings, exercises, and
activities. The units can be used in their entirety or selectively,
depending on student background, ability, interest, and time.
<H3>Unit 1: Nuclear Waste</H3>

<P>
Unit 1 helps establish the relevance of the topic of nuclear waste
to everyday lives and activities. It provides an examination of
the different types of nuclear waste and the geographic distribution
of spent nuclear fuel in the United States. The relationship between
the total volume and radioactivity of nuclear waste is also explored.
Review activities explain energy, electricity, and the nuclear
fission process. Students are given the opportunity to: 
<UL>
<LI>Discuss various energy sources used to generate electricity

<LI>List and define the four categories of nuclear waste and state
how each type of waste is or will be disposed of 
<LI>Discuss the relevance of nuclear waste in their lives.
</UL>

<H3>Unit 2: Ionizing Radiation</H3>

<P>
Unit 2 conveys factual information about radioactivity and radiation
and relates that information to the personal lives of students
and to the management and disposal of nuclear waste. Students
experiment and learn that, although radiation cannot be detected
with the senses, it is possible to study radiation and radioactive
decay through indirect observation. Students also address the
concept of ionizing radiation, learning that it exists in nature
and can result from human activity. Student learn to: 
<UL>
<LI>Define ionizing radiation and name both natural and manmade
sources 
<LI>State how many millirem of exposure the average American receives
annually 
<LI>Complete a chart on half-lives of radioisotopes and explain
its significance.
</UL>

<H3>Unit 3: Nuclear Waste Policy Act</H3>

<P>
Unit 3 presents our Nation's nuclear waste dilemma and introduces
the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). Risks specifically associated
with nuclear waste are explored, and students examine their own
risk judgments through hands-on activities. Upon completion of
this unit, students are able to: 
<UL>
<LI>Name the key provisions of the NWPA and identify the agencies
involved in the high-level radioactive waste management program

<LI>Discuss whether this generation of future generations should
provide for disposal of nuclear waste currently in storage 
<LI>Identify how and why the NWPA provides for public participation

<LI>Identify major steps involved in completing a complex project

<LI>Discuss probabilities and risk assessment on an introductory
level.
</UL>

<H3>Unit 4: Waste Management System</H3>

<P>
Unit 4 explains how elements of the high-level nuclear waste management
system will work together to provide both short- and long-term
protection of people and the environment. Major elements of the
high-level nuclear waste management system include storage, transportation,
and disposal in a geologic repository. Upon completion of this
unit, students are able to: 
<UL>
<LI>Discuss transportation safety standards 
<LI>Define the role of interim storage 
<LI>Evaluate characteristics important in repository siting.
</UL>

<P>
The curriculum is available to educators free of charge. To order
copies, including both Teachers Guides and Student Readers, call 1-800-225-NWPA (6972).
