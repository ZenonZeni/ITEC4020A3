<H1>Schizophrenia, glutamine and the dopamine hypothesis<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Tuesday plenary session: Recent advances in the therapeutics of schizophrenia:
is dopamine relevant?</H3>
Professor Arvid Carlsson from the Department of Pharmacology, University
of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan, Gothenburg, Sweden, predicted that 1996
will mark a neuropsychopharmacological milestone in advancing the therapeutics
of schizophrenia. In his address to delegates at the first plenary session
of the XXth CINP Congress, Professor Carlsson described the modulatory effects
on the dopaminergic system of new substances (-)3PPP and MDL100907, and
hypothesised that, following clinical trials, these and similar agents may
have the capacity to markedly improve the management of schizophrenia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Subcortical monoaminergic systems are kept under strict glutaminergic
control,&quot; said Professor Carlsson as he examined the hypothesis of
glutaminergic inhibition of dopaminergic systems. A lack of these inhibitory
effects could result in increased dopaminergic activity, possibly resulting
in psychosis in a subgroup of people with schizophrenia.<BR>
<BR>
As monoaminergic systems respond to a variety of stresses, glutaminergic
deficiencies could exaggerate overall responses in neural circuits, producing
instabilities without any changes in dopaminergic neural tone.<BR>
<BR>
Experimental evidence indicates that glutaminergic deficiency enhances behavioural
stimulation induced by 5-HT2 agonists, mixed dopaminergic agonists, alpha-adrenergic
agonists and muscarinic antagonists. Novel therapeutic approaches to schizophrenia
could utilise these pathways.<BR>
&quot;If glutaminergic deficiency is important, therapy should aim at stabilising
glutaminergic activities,&quot; said Professor Carlsson. He discussed promising
experimental results achieved with the 5HT2a receptor antagonist MDL100907
and the partial dopamine agonist <BR>
(-)3PPP, both of which are currently undergoing clinical testing.<BR>
<BR>
The plenary Chair, Professor Brian Leonard from The Department of Pharmacology,
University College, Galway, Ireland, said that he looked forward to the
presentation of this clinical testing at the XXIst CINP Congress in Glasgow
in 1998.<BR>

<H1>Treating mood disorders in women - special issues<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Tuesday symposia: Pharmacotherapy of affective disorders in women: Parts
1 and 2. </H3>
The serotonergic system is more vulnerable to dysregulation in females than
males, which <BR>
may help to explain the higher incidence of mood disorders in women, according
to Professor Meir Steiner from McMaster University, Ontario, Canada. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The serotonergic system is in a very close reciprocal relationship
with the gonadal hormones, and a disturbance in the interaction between
the hypothalmic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the serotonergic cascade may
be of particular relevance to mood disorders in women,&quot; said Professor
Steiner.<BR>
Complex pharmacological issues in pregnancy and lactation<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The use of psychotropic medications during pregnancy and lactation
is a complex clinical issue laden with ethical concerns and handicapped
by limited data,&quot; said Dr Zachary Stowe from the Department of Psychiatry
and Behavioural Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta,
USA. <BR>
<BR>
Dr Stowe was reviewing the pharmacokinetics of psychotropic medications
in these special situations, and also discussed recent data suggesting that
infants exposed to sertraline via breast milk do not suffer any adverse
effects.
<H3>No direct effect on mood from progesterone</H3>
Exogenous progesterone does not appear to affect mood in premenstrual women
directly, but the remission of symptoms achieved by suppressing ovulation
suggests indirect involvement of the gonadal hormones. According to Dr Ellen
Freeman from the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia,
USA, antidepressants &quot;effectively improve the mood and behavioural
symptoms of PMS, but whether the effect is specific to the serotonergic
system is not yet identified&quot;. 
<H3>Dysthymic women may respond better to SSRIs</H3>
&quot;Women with chronic milder depressions - such as dysthymia - may have
a higher response rate to serotonin reuptake inhibitors&quot; (SSRIs) than
men. Dr Kimberly Yonkers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, USA, presented data showing that, although women are more
likely to respond to active treatment with either sertraline or imipramine,
they are also more likely to discontinue treatment. 
<H3>Hormones and antidepressants act synergistically</H3>
Synergy between the interactions of hormones and antidepressant drugs at
serotonin receptor subtypes can be exploited to tailor effective antidepressant
regimens for women with mood disorders that are unresponsive to antidepressant
monotherapy, according to Dr Stephen Stahl from the Department of Psychiatry,
University of California, San Diego, USA.<BR>

<H1>CINP President's report: 1994-1996</H1>
<H2>Lewis L Judd, MD, President, Collegium Internationale <BR>
Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum, 1994-1996<BR>
</H2>
I am pleased to report to the membership of the Collegium Internationale
Neuro-Psycho-pharmacoligicum (CINP) on the events and accomplishments of
the CINP during the past two years (1994-1996). My presidency began at the
very successful XIXth CINP Congress in Washington, DC, with the presentation
at the opening ceremony attended by the US Vice-President's wife, Tipper
Gore. The highlight of the Congress was the scientific programme, which
proved to be the largest and best in CINP history with over 160 scientific
symposia presented to the <BR>
almost 5000 delegates from 62 countries.<BR>
<BR>
In June 1995, the CINP Regional Meeting was held in Vienna and Prague and
adopted the theme, Neuroscience and neuropsychopharmacology East and West
at the beginning of the European Decade of the Brain. This meeting was designed
to promote collaboration between basic and clinical scientists from Eastern,
Central and Western Europe, and was attended by more than 500 delegates
representing every European nation. A monograph of the proceedings will
be published shortly and sent to all CINP members.<BR>
<BR>
On 25 February 1996, a CINP Satellite Meeting, Comparison of CNS mechanisms
of action and therapeutic uses of the new antidepressants was held in La
Jolla, California. This was followed by the 1996 CINP President's Workshop,
Unipolar major depression: one primary disease or multiple discrete related
disorders and subtypes? Implications for the lifecourse and management of
unipolar disorders. The workshop featured presentations and discussions
by world leaders in regard to mood disorders. The proceedings will be published
as a special issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders with the CINP President
as Guest Editor.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to outreach initiatives to Eastern and Central Europe, the CINP
strengthened its ties and support to Latin America by encouraging and consulting
with our colleagues in their establishment of the Latin American College
of NeuroPsychopharmacology.<BR>
<BR>
The CINP provided regular consultation in neuropsychopharmacology and neuroscience
to the Division of Mental Health of the WHO, as well as providing leadership
in the development of the Decade of the Brain efforts in various interested
nations.<BR>
<BR>
My two years as CINP President will culminate both in the publication of
the history of CINP and the running of the XXth CINP Congress in Melbourne.
This has proven to be a very successful CINP Congress - noted for its friendly
ambience and superb science.<BR>
<BR>
In summary, it has been a busy, productive time for CINP during the past
two years, one in <BR>
which the CINP has experienced significant growth and accomplished a great
deal. The CINP Executive Committee, the Council and I are looking forward
to supporting the programme <BR>
of our next President, Claude de Montigny.<BR>

<H1>&quot;Chemical coding&quot;: a new model for neurotransmission?<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Tuesday symposium: Neuropeptides and their receptors</H3>
<B><BR>
</B>The traditional model of neurotransmission - the release of a single
transmitter to act on a small population of receptors - has been dramatically
overturned by recent research, according to Professor John Furness, Head
of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Melbourne,
Australia. Work since the late 1980s has led to the development of the &quot;chemical
coding&quot; hypothesis of neurotransmission, in which neurons release multiple
bioactive substances that produce a variety of pharmacological and physiological
consequences.<BR>
<BR>
In contrast to earlier models, it has been found that most neurons contain
and release up to eight bioactive substances. This process is known as co-transmission.
<BR>
<BR>
Professor Furness said that there is no shortage of potential substances
to be released. &quot;There are now more than 100 peptides known in the
CNS,&quot; he explained, &quot;but the question is: how many of them are
neurotransmitters?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
While many peptides are released from neurons, they may not function specifically
as transmitters. Some do act directly at receptors, but others affect message
transduction via non-receptor mechanisms, act as &quot;third messengers&quot;
to provide feedback within the neuron, or have no apparent function at all.
<H3>Combinations of transmitters constitute a chemical code</H3>
The variety of neuronal combinations of these co-transmitters has led to
the rethinking of neuronal function. &quot;The extensive co-localisation
of neurotransmitters has led to the 'chemical coding' hypothesis,&quot;
explained Professor Furness. &quot;Neurons contain specific groupings of
bioactive substances which constitute a code, and this code is transmitted
when the neurons release their mixture of co-transmitters,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Adding to the complexity of neurotransmission is the increased knowledge
of receptor subtypes provided by molecular biology. Professor Furness said
that &quot;many peptide receptors have been cloned in the last few years,
and it has been found that they are more varied than one might think.&quot;
For every transmitter or ligand there may be five or more receptors, although
many newly cloned &quot;orphan receptors&quot; presently have no known endogenous
ligand. <BR>
The enormous number of possible interactions - and physiological and psychiatric
consequences - of ligand-receptor combinations in the CNS will provide fertile
ground for research for decades to come.<BR>

<H1>More information needed before marijuana legalisation considered<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Monday CINP special session: The marijuana debate.</H3>
More research is needed on the effects of marijuana on the brain, a special
CINP debate concluded. The debate followed the Victorian Parliament's recent
decision not to legalise the possession of small quantities of the drug
for personal use.<BR>
<BR>
Heavy use of marijuana, in parts of the world where it is part of the local
culture, is known to affect the brain, but little is known about the effects
of occasional use.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;More data on the neuropharmacological effects of marijuana are needed
before an informed decision concerning any change of legal status can be
made,&quot; said Professor Bruce Singh from the Department of Psychiatry,
University of Melbourne, Australia.<BR>
<BR>
Those in favour of legalisation of marijuana insist that the drug is no
more dangerous than alcohol. &quot;I would be sceptical of any analogy between
alcohol and marijuana,&quot; warned Dr Fred Goodwin, former Director (1988-1992)
of the US Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration. &quot;Drinking
two alcoholic drinks per day is safe and even health promoting, but few
people would argue that daily users of marijuana do not suffer psychological
effects.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Alcohol is metabolised quickly, whereas marijuana stays in the body for
4 days. The drug builds up in the body and its effects are therefore escalated
in daily users. <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana exacerbates schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, heavy
alcohol abuse has only rarely been associated with schizophrenia, said Dr
Goodwin. <BR>
<BR>
Dr Goodwin said that the attitude to marijuana use in the United States
was that legalisation would be counterproductive. &quot;We would be presenting
a double message by saying this drug is legal but don't use it,&quot; Dr
Goodwin explained. &quot;Legislation seemed to make the 'don't do' message
hypocritical.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, experience in The Netherlands indicates that decriminalisation
of marijuana does not increase its use, and decriminalisation has the benefit
of not &quot;marginalising the many youngsters who take the drug by making
them criminals,&quot; said Dr Goodwin. <BR>
<BR>
More than half of Year 11 students were estimated to have used marijuana
in Australia last year, and it was believed that it would be easier to educate
them about drug use if marijuana was legalised. &quot;It was thought to
be inappropriate to educate youngsters about a substance that is illegal,&quot;
said Professor Singh. &quot;Drug education requires drug legalisation.&quot;<BR>

<H1>Study throws doubt on PTSD hypothesis<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Tuesday symposium: Post-traumatic stress disorder.</H3>
A Melbourne study's failed attempt to replicate the results of previous
studies raises a question mark over the role of enhanced negative feedback
inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD).<BR>
<BR>
Previous studies show lower basal cortisol levels in traumatised patients
with PTSD compared with those of traumatised individuals who do not develop
PTSD and other psychiatric patients. PTSD sufferers also show an enhanced
suppression of cortisol following dexamethasone administration.<BR>
&quot;We expected similar results to previous studies and were surprised
when we didn't get them,&quot; said Dr Mal Hopwood from the University of
Melbourne, Australia. &quot;There was no difference in the cortisol response
between the Vietnam veterans with past, present or no history of PTSD.&quot;<BR>
It is unlikely that the fact that the normal controls in the Melbourne study
were veterans could have influenced the results. Professor Philip Morris
from the University of Melbourne, Australia, said: &quot;The post-dexamethasone
cortisol values are in the same ball park as those of non-veteran controls
in other studies.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, combat experience is an issue that Dr Hopwood wants to discount.
&quot;We are presently negotiating with the police force to set up another
study with age-matched controls who have not had PTSD,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
It was suggested that the criteria for recruitment into the study were less
stringent than in other studies, particularly US studies. Dr Hopwood argued:
&quot;Hamilton ratings for depression of around 20 have been used as normal
in other studies, and our ratings were much lower at around 12.&quot;<BR>

<H1>Further evidence that stress-related depression is linked to corticosteroid
and monaminergic mechanisms<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Wednesday symposium: Stress, hypersecretion of corticosteroids, monaminergic
disturbance: a trias operational in the occurrence of depression?</H3>
Explaining the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of stress and vulnerability
to depression may help crystallise new therapeutic approaches to the treatment,
prevention and recurrence of affective disorders, according to Dr Robert
Post from the Biological Psychiatry Branch, National Institute of Mental
Health, Bethesda, USA. At this morning's symposium he is presenting further
evidence for postulated acute biochemical changes of stress and affective
disorders that effect longer term changes at the level of gene expression
<H3>Implications for the treatment of affective disorders</H3>
Dr Herman Van Praag from the Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology,
University of Limburg, The Netherlands, postulates that stress-related corticosteroid
hypersecretion in a biologically compromised 5-HT1A patient would induce
faster down-regulation of the 5-HT1A system. <BR>
<BR>
This would cause a rise in the level of anxiety and anger, and finally result
in major depression. This would be likely to occur in a patient with a personality
disorder who deals inappropriately with stress. <BR>
<BR>
In this situation, Dr Van Praag predicts that effective treatment would
require a 5-HT1A-agonist and psychological intervention aimed at increasing
resistance to stress.
<H3>Abnormal corticosteroid secretion impairs 5-HT responses and cognitive
function</H3>
Changes in cortisol secretion or 5-HT-receptor deficits impair 5-HT responses,
and cognitive functions become impaired during hyper- or hypocortisolism
or in the case of receptor deficits, reports E Ronald de Kloet from the
Division of Medical Pharmacology, Leiden University, The Netherlands. Animal
experiments have shown that a negative event in early life, such as maternal
deprivation, results in cortisol receptor resistance, increasing vulnerability
to depression.<BR>
<BR>
Florian Holsboer from the Max Planck Institutes of Psychiatry, Clinical
Institute, Munich, Germany, says that normal corticosteroid receptor function
is a precondition of successful treatment in depression. If alterations
in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis persist after antidepressant treatment,
a poor treatment outcome is more likely.<BR>
<BR>
These, and further presentations, add to the growing body of evidence relating
to the biochemical and endocrinological mechanisms of the impact of exogenous
stress on the development of affective disorders, and highlight future directions
for research and treatments.<BR>
<BR>
The symposium Stress, hypersecretion of corticosteroids, monaminergic disturbance:
a trias operational in the occurrence of depression? is at 0830-1100 in
Otway 2 today.<BR>
Information relating closely to this session is presented at the symposium
Stress vulnerability and depression at 0830-1100 in room B2 tomorrow (see

<H1>Conference announcement: Second World Congress on Stress<BR>
</H1>
<H3>25-29 October 1998, Melbourne, Australia</H3>
The Second World Congress on Stress builds on the success of the First World
Congress in New York, and continues to consolidate the relationship between
clinicians and basic scientists who are endeavouring to elucidate the underlying
biological mechanisms of stress and increasing the understanding of the
management of stress-related conditions.<BR>
<BR>
The understanding of the clinical impact of biochemical, physiological and
endocrine mechanisms of stress has advanced considerably since Hans Selye's
discovery in 1945 that the release of adrenal cortical hormones following
a stressful incident initiates a cascade of events with widespread effects
on multiple body systems.<BR>
<BR>
While psychological factors play an important role in almost every medical
condition, stress, combined with constitutional or genetic vulnerabilities,
may alter the course of a wide variety of common medical and psychiatric
conditions, resulting in a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes.<BR>
<BR>
The Second World Congress on Stress extends a special invitation to clinicians
from all backgrounds. Medical specialists (cardiologists, dermatologists,
endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, neurologists,
oncologists, respiratory physicians and rheumatologists) as well as psychiatrists
and psychologists will benefit from an increased understanding of how stress-related
physiological responses exacerbate or delay recovery from the course of
a general medical illness.<BR>
<BR>
The Second World Congress on Stress highlights the epidemiology, basic science,
natural history and management of stress and how this impacts on a variety
of disciplines and specialties. From the laboratory to the clinic, the interface
and exchange among experts from diverse backgrounds promises to provide
a stimulating and innovative conference.<BR>

<H1>No &quot;cry for help&quot; in successful youth suicide?<BR>
</H1>
<H3>Tuesday symposium: Suicide.</H3>
Almost 90% of young people who successfully complete suicide have no history
of previous suicide attempts, according to a study presented to the symposium
by Professor Graham Burrows, AO, KSJ, from the Austin Repatriation Hospital
and Professor John Tiller from the Royal Melbourne Hospital, both from the
University of Melbourne, Australia. <BR>
<BR>
Professor Burrows presented the results of the retrospective arm of the
study of completed suicides of young people in the State of Victoria, Australia.
He said that the youth suicide rate has tripled since the 1950s without
a corresponding rise in the suicide rates of other age groups. Young men
aged 20-24 years are particularly vulnerable. <BR>
<BR>
The method of suicide was linked with access to the corresponding means.
Young people in rural areas were more likely to use firearms, while jumping
from tall buildings occurred mainly in city areas.<BR>
<BR>
The results of the prospective study, presented by Professor Tiller, confirmed
the findings of the retrospective study, but allowed a comparison between
completed suicides and attempted suicides in young people aged 15-24 years.
Males comprised a high proportion (86%) of completed suicides, while 62%
of attempted suicides were female. In both completed and attempted suicides,
females were more likely to attempt suicide by drug overdose or self-laceration,
while men used more lethal methods such as hanging, firearms and carbon
monoxide poisoning.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Tiller said that effective targeting of youth suicide prevention
programmes need to recognise that those whose suicide attempts were unsuccessful
often sought help prior to suicide, while failure to seek help was highly
associated with completed suicides. Therefore programmes that concentrate
only on improving mental health services may fail to detect some young people
at high risk of suicide. Raising community awareness of the need to recognise
potential suicide attempts in young people may be necessary.<BR>
