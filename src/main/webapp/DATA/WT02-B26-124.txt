<STRONG>Contents
</STRONG>



<P>Barron's covers what happens when money and markets come together -- who wins, who perhaps loses, in terms of what assets (stocks, bonds, oil, gold etc.) and for what reasons.</P>



<P>What's more, Barron's explores what well may happen in the markets next, thereby arming investors for the shocks and turmoil of market battles to come and allowing them to survive -- indeed, to thrive -- as a result.</P>





<P>Financial survival and success being as highly esteemed as they are, Barron's is read intensely, cover-to-cover, week-after-week, by some of the most powerful (read &quot;rich and influential&quot;) people in the world.</P>





<P>Different parts of the publication contain different information (data, insights and ideas), expressed in different ways (feature articles, columns, Q&As, charts and tables, financial statistics etc.) on different markets, the economy, sectors and companies. Thus, how each person reads Barron's varies with each person's needs.</P>





<P>But there's one constant among all these readers: It is the remarkable <EM>utility </EM>of Barron's that they value most -- the fact that Barron's gives them immediately useful information that they can (almost literally) take to the bank.</P><BR>





<STRONG>Parts of the Whole</STRONG><!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>




<P><EM>Barron's</EM> is made up of two distinct parts -- a center pullout section called &quot;Market Week,&quot; and the pages that wrap around this center section and that we call (quite naturally enough) &quot;The Wrap.&quot;</P>





<P><STRONG>The Wrap</STRONG>  contains the cover story, feature stories, the weekly Q&A, some regular columns, the departments and the editorial material.</P>





<P><STRONG>Market Week</STRONG> covers the previous week's market activities in detail with columns that focus on specific markets, the comprehensive statistics in the financial pages, and the final eight pages of market data and macroeconomic data known as the &quot;Market Lab.&quot;</P>





<P>Barron's editorial perspective is to look back at what happened in the markets, and then to project forward to what may happen next. So the physical makeup of the publication mirrors our editorial focus:</P>




<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> an inner pullout that chronicles the markets' activities for the previous week and<BR><BR>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> an outer wrap whose articles, columns and departments explore the possibilities (good, bad and indifferent) for the economy, sectors, companies and investment categories.
<BR>
<BR>





<P><STRONG>I. <EM>The Wrap</EM></STRONG> contains, on any given week, the following material in this usual order of appearance through the publication:</P>

An insider must report to the SEC, by the 10th of the month following a trade, any transaction that he or she has engaged in. The Insider Transactions table shows the largest dollar value transactions reported to the SEC for a specified period. Heavy sales might indicate that the insiders are pessimistic about the company's prospects; heavy purchases might indicate an optimistic outlook.
