<img src="../caps/ocap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="O">ne day in early 1996, investors and others worldwide suddenly had access to more information about today's Vietnam than they could digest. They could read the entire foreign investment law and locate dozens of key business contacts. They could even tour Vietnam's most remote countryside. All this from their computers, from the Vietnam Homepage, newly-launched on Internet.<p>

<img src="../october96/cover/rel2pic.gif" valign=top align=right alt="Computer Room Photo">

Ironically, Vietnamese themselves cannot view the Vietnam Homepage, since the Internet is not accessible from within Vietnam. Yet telecom authorities enthusiastically announced to the VBJ that this is will change within days. In the past 18 months Internet access in Vietnam has heated into a central telecom issue, but it appears that commercial Internet access could be available much sooner than most expect.<p>

Since March 1995, a local dial-up e-mail service and small database has been available to the public in Hanoi, and more recently in HCMC. Other academic "bulletin boards" exist, but do not provide Internet access. Internet usage has exploded over the rest of the world, attracting thousands of new users daily and drawing huge profits for some providers. This system, carried out over simple phone lines that ultimately connect to a gateway, made coherent through the use of "search" software, has become a vanguard informational and marketing tool, especially for small and medium-sized businesses.<p>

Over the past two years Vietnamese authorities, including DGPT (the state telecom regulator), have been figuring out how to deal with the Internet. Impeding movement have been vexing social issues and potential revenue loss from virtually free electronic data transference. The issue has been pushed along by the efforts of Australia National University (ANU) in Canberra (which also produced the Vietnam Homepage mentioned above) and Hanoi's Institute of Information Technology, which has cooperated with ANU to introduce Internet technology simultaneously to Vietnamese technicians, academics, and government officials.<p>

NetNam is not true Internet access, but a "dial-up server" which sends batches of e-mail to ANU via satellite for Internet delivery several times daily. It also makes available to subscribers a small database geared to NGOs and businesses in Vietnam, and even includes forums for apartment rentals and jokes. NetNam is funded by grants from NGO and Vietnamese government sources, and over the past 18 months has attracted more than 1,000 users, mostly foreigners, who pay up to $40 per month or more.<p>

This technology heralds an exciting and potentially profitable future for some access and content providers. For now, however, NetNam has yet to reach its primary technical goal: converting the system from a local dial-up server which connects to Telstra's X.25 satellite connection (then to ANU's gateway) to a VNPT-owned wide-band line that can serve as a gateway itself.<p>

According to industry sources, it was NetNam's efforts to lease a wide-band line from VNPT, which kicked off the issue (and the ensuing race). Perhaps following China's lead, in the spring of 1995 officials decided to take stock and halted NetNam's march toward increased services. In the meantime, an electronic data subsidiary of Vietnam Post and Telecomunications Corp. (VNPT) hired Sprint to install appropriate data transmission infrastructure, including 31 nodes across the country that allow for local dial-up. NetNam appealed to authorities, according to operators there, to allow them, not a VNPT subsidiary, to become the country's first gateway operator. Their cause spilled into the public forum. It was spurred by a public letter issued by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE) which argued that handing Internet rights to VNPT is inappropriate because its value-added properties are rooted in technology and information, not telecom.<p>

On May 23, DGPT made a move. The regulator declared that it would issue licenses to "provide Internet services and connections." A committee comprised of MOSTE, DGPT, the Communist Party, as well as Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Culture and Information, was established to review the process and take tentative steps. The short-list of potential service providers, say industry sources: 3C, FTP, Telnic, One Computer. Licenses are already being issued, although it is not yet clear what they validate. Also not resolved or legislated is whether VNPT will lease lines to licensed providers, and at what rates.<p>

In fact, the game could be played out on the lines. NetNam wishes to become gateway and is now trying to prove its capability to the Internet committee. In the meantime, companies are already pushing through this gray area toward anticipated profits. Using only technical books, BaTIN, a 3C subsidiary, designed a content page that presents statistics, travel information, even recipes, and can be read in Vietnamese or English. It is already accessible online at <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~binh/home.htm">http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~binh/home.htm</a>, via a mirror site from ANU. In September, BaTIN will offer e-mail services, sending batches through NetNam's system or directly through VNPT, if permitted, said 3C executives.<p>

State-owned telecom authorities are also going full steam ahead. "We will offer e-mail this week," said Ho Khanh Lam, marketing exec of Vietnam Data Communication (VDC) in early August. Lam told The VBJ that VDC aims to offer Internet services commercially in Vietnam in September, starting with "special Vietnamese offices" approved by VDC and DGPT. Two gateways would be established by DGPT by the end of the year, in HCMC and Hanoi, announced DGPT, which already has the technology.<p>

Meanwhile, NetNam's future as a service-provider or gateway is in the lurch; it must prove itself technically and legally to the Internet Committee, and simultaneously rely on that committee to ensure reliable access to its competitor's telecom infrastructure.<p>

Telecom officials argue that NetNam is an academic service established to transfer technology, and they've obviously done a good job, since the industry is now moving ahead. Says VDC's Lam, "NetNam is not a business office. It doesn't pay for consumption, didn't register its service on the telecom network, and doesn't pay tax." Nevertheless, NetNam administrators say they would be the most competent gateway operators and don't plan on giving up. Says one NetNam customer watching the scenario, "Especially with Internet and telecom, technology changes every two weeks-you can't just transfer technology and say goodbye."<p>

Until this is sorted out, there is just one popular (although costly) method of gaining Internet access in Vietnam: using a call-back service to access an offshore account with Compuserve or another provider. This method brings no profits to the domestic telecom system and keeps the infant Internet industry on all fours.<p>
