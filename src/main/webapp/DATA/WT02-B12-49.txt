A White House briefing paper quoted in the Feb. 5 Washington Post
article about the new Clipper announcement was actually a Q and A
originally released April 16, 1993 and included in the packet of
information provided by the administration for last week's announcement.
The administration did not announce on Feb. 4th that it retained the right
to restrict alternate encryption plans for domestic use. A clarification
will run in tomorrow's Washington Post. <p>
