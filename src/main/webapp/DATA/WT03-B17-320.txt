<PRE>
         The very first thing that you must do once you
     are aware that you are having some type of problem is to find
     out if your home is being attacked by termites or carpenter ants.
     Carpenter ants can be controlled
     a lot easier by the homeowner than termites can be
     controlled (see carpenter ants, in this same section, for control strategies).

        Look in the yellow pages under termite
    inspectors. Talk with them about termites verus carpenter ants.
    See if they are willing to tell you
    if your home does have termites or whether it has carpenter
   ants.

            Termite-detecting dogs are available, they are
    called TADD dogs.
    For more information call BIRC at 415-524-2567 and ask
    them about TADD dogs and while you are at it,
    order the book "Common Sense Pest Control".
   They have a great chatper on Termites as well as much
   information on other pests. a great book!  Tell 'em The Invisible
   Gardener sent ya!

               In our Dances with Termites dept, step 1 is how to do
   an inspection yourself. This is not hard to do or expensive.

              Step 2 covers steps you can take to protect
   your home from termites.

              Step 3 covers tools and equipment needed for
   monitoring termites.

                Step 4 covers the various natural/organic
   treatments available which can be used against the termites.
