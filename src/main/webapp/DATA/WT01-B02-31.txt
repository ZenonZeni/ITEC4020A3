  <BR>
The purpose of this descriptive and correlational study was to examine, regarding home education families and their children throughout Montana, (a) demographics, (b) selected educational characteristics of the families and students, (c) academic achievement of the students, and (d) relationships between their academic achievement and various factors.<BR>
    <BR>
In general, these home educating parents had somewhat higher than average educational attainment. The annual family income (median of $30,000) was similar to (or slightly lower than) that of all married couple families in Montana. These families were much larger than average for Montana, with 3.2 children per family. Families spent $329 per year to home educate each child.<BR>
    <BR>
The mother did 87% of the formal teaching of the children while the father did 11% of the teaching. The large majority of these children were not being taught by professionally trained and government certified teachers.<BR>
 <BR>
On average, the children had been taught at home for 4.2 years since age 5, 54% were in grades K through 5, and their parents generally planned to home educate them through their secondary school years. Curriculum materials were hand picked, rather than being purchased complete programs, by parents for 68% of the students. The social activities of these home educated children were quite varied. For example, 56% were involved in group sports, 85% were in Sunday school, 54% were involved in music classes, 55% took other classes with students outside of the home, and 96% engaged in play activities with people outside of the family.<BR>
<BR>
These students scored, on the average, at relatively high percentiles on standardized academic achievement tests: (a) total reading, 75th, (b) total listening, 73rd, (c) total language, 63rd, (d) total math, 67th, (e) science, 77nd, (f) social studies, 75th, (g) basic battery (reading, language, and mathematics), 70th, and (h) complete battery (all subject areas in which student was tested), 73rd.<BR>
  <BR>
Several predictor variables (i.e., father's educational attainment, father's teacher certification status, family income, number of children in the family, years child was home educated, presence of a computer in the home, and amount of money spent on home education) were not significant in explaining variance in any of the testing areas.<BR>
<BR>
Mother's educational attainment, structure in the teaching and learning environment, gender of student, mother's teacher certification status, and use of libraries did, in some categories, serve as significant predictors of academic achievement. These variables, however, were generally relatively weak in their ability to explain variation in scores. Very few factors, that at first seem important, appear to be able to predict the academic achievement of the home educated. This and other studies indicate that very few background variables explain the academic achievement of the home educated, and it is possible that the home education environment eliminates the effect, in a positive way, of many variables which could reasonably be expected to affect achievement.
