<h2>MANAGED EQUITY PORTFOLIOS (MEP)</h2>
<p>LBS offers three unique individually managed portfolios - Large Cap, MidCap and Core equity. These programs employ two 
branches of Computational Intelligence: neural networks and genetic algorithms. The MEP program allows the individual 
investor to participate in the same strategies employed by some of the country&#146;s largest institutional investors.<br>
</p>
<h2 align=left>ASSET ALLOCATION</h2>
<p align=left><strong>Focused Sector Opportunities</strong><br>
An aggressively managed mutual fund program that rotates client assets among Fidelity Select Funds, using LBS technology to 
periodically shift assets to the three sectors (of 35) deemed to have the greatest performance potential for the intermediate 
term.</p>
<p align=left><strong>SMAART...a first of its kind global asset allocation program</strong><br>
This program manages risk by diversifying assets globally among 6-8 stock and bond funds selected from 10 asset classes. 
Each fund is pre-screened for excellence. Accounts are dynamically rebalanced and re-weighted as market conditions dictate. 
With the simplicity of a single account, SMAART provides clients with an investment in multiple mutual funds and a strategy 
designed to reduce investment risk.<br>
</p>
<h2 align=left>INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p align=left><strong>Individual Mutual Fund and Variable Annuities</strong> <br>
LBS manages investment risk for over 300 mutual funds and variable annuities covering a broad spectrum of global equity and 
fixed income asset classes. OMNI, LBS&#146; proprietary risk management model, is designed to keep accounts invested in rising 
markets and shift them to the safety of money markets when the systems anticipate a period of high risk.</p>
<p align=left><strong>MAXIMIZER - an LBS exclusive</strong><br>
In this program, LBS selects the funds, using technology to identify and invest accounts in three to four equity funds from a 
pre-screened universe of domestic or international funds. When OMNI anticipates a period of high risk, accounts are 
transferred to the safety of money markets; when a buy signal is registered, the universe is re-analyzed and accounts <br>
are reinvested in funds exhibiting the greatest relative strength and momentum at that time. With the convenience of a single 
account, this program is designed to rotate clients&#146; investments among top performing domestic or international funds. This 
strategy seeks maximum returns while controlling market risk.</p>
<p align=left><strong>Global Advantage</strong><br>
The Global Advantage program is designed to combine, in a single account, LBS&#146;<u> Investment Risk Management</u> signals with 
an asset allocation approach. The driving force behind the program is the inverse correlation demonstrated by U.S. and foreign 
equity markets. Based on our intermediate market forecasts, the program shifts assets among domestic equities, international 
equities, and money markets.</p>
