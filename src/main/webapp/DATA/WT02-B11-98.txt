<P>&gt; In the latest privatization setback, irate bidders await clarification
of the government's decision &#150; under union pressure &#150;  to suspend the
opening of  the long-distance telecommunications sector. &gt;&gt; After a delay
in setting ground rules, bidding for the national railway network is to begin
this month. &gt;&gt; The government plans to change the constitution after a
court ruled against a 1994 investment protection treaty with the UK. &gt;&gt;<B>Ecopetrol</B>
will float a $150 million bond issue backed by Cusiana revenues.  Page 2</P>

<P>&gt; <B>Pacific Gas, Bechtel</B> and <B>Pacific Services Enterprises</B>
won the Camisea thermoelectricity plant contract with a &quot;more integrated

has launched an LPG plant near Callao and plans a five-year,  $50 million
expansion program.  Page 3 </P>
<P><B>BOLIVIA</B></P>
<P>&gt; The offer of Brazil's <B>Petrobras</B> to Bolivia of a $280 million
advance payment against future gas deliveries from the cross-border pipeline is
a breakthrough that promises to strengthen offers for the privatization of
Bolivia's <B>YPFB.</B>  Page 4</P>
<P><B> MEXICO</B></P>
<P>&gt; The explosion at the Cactus gas complex in Chiapas is a severe blow to
the government's campaign to increase gas use.  &gt;&gt;  But private companies
are anxious to get into the gas market, as bidding for the Mexicali gas
distribution permit showed.  &gt;&gt;  The <B>US Trade and Development Agency</B>
is promoting $10 billion worth of infrastructure projects in Mexico.  Page 5</P>

<P>&gt; Top energy executives cannot agree on whether severe power shortages
are in the offing and, if they are, how to solve them. &gt;&gt;  The business
community has greeted President Cardoso's new  $79 billion projects and social
investment program with skepticism.  Page 7 </P>

<P>&gt; Six international bidders have gone down to the wire for a 37.5% stake

<P>&gt; <B>HIT</B> of Hong Kong easily won the Panama Canal ports concession,
more than doubling its only competitor's $10 million offer.  &gt;&gt;  <B>Southwestern

<H2>What Is the Truth Behind Upcoming Blackout Threat?</H2>
<P>Power sector executives have plunged into a game of truth or consequences
following grim blackout forecasts for the industrial states of Sao Paulo, Rio de
Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Though the head of Sao Paulo state energy company <B>CESP</B>
has predicted short blackouts starting this month, executives with the Itaipu
dam and Minas Gerais electricity company <B>Cemig</B> say supply is far more
adequate. Meanwhile, <B>Citibank Brazil</B>'s privatization chief says that
electricity generation is not likely to increase until Brazil's government
establishes a clearer pricing policy.</P>
<H3>Dry Winter Threatens Supply</H3>
<P>Sao Paulo's CESP was among the first to wave the red flag, warning customers
of potential 10-minute (or more) blackouts this month due to growing domestic
and commercial consumption as water resources shrank during a dry winter season.
At least two generating plants in Sao Paulo were urged to increase output,
although the solution has led to a controversy over environmental consequences.
To give a local hydro plant sufficient water to operate at full capacity during
peak hours, the highly polluted waters of the Pinheiros river would be diverted
to the Billings dam. The problem is that the Billings dam also provides Sao
Paulo's drinking water. And stepping up production at the oil-fired Piratininga
plant would increase pollution in a section of Sao Paulo city already known for
its dreadful air quality. </P>
<H3>Others Disagree</H3>
<P>By contrast, Itaipu director Euclides Scalco has said he foresees no energy
blackouts in southeastern Brazil in the coming months. However, he warned that
the situation may worsen without new investments of at least $6 billion per
year, although he acknowledged that domestic energy consumption grew by 7% in
the last two years while overall economic growth was less than 4%. According to
official reports from Itaipu, the biggest power generation plant in Brazil and
one of the biggest in the world, supply and demand will reach equilibrium in Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Brasilia when the complex increases its
output to 33 million KW per hour by the year 2005.</P>
<P>Minas Gerais state power company Cemig doesn't foresee risks of power cuts
until the end of the year at the very earliest. Its current figures say domestic
consumption grew by 9.4% and commercial by 10.2%, but that the industry was
consuming 8% less energy than last year. Company officials said that the
situation could get worse in 1998 or 1999, but that chances of blackouts this
year and in 1997 are very small.</P>
<H3>No Centralized Planning</H3>
<P>A bigger problem may be Brazil's continuing weaknesses in strategic planning
and policy coordination. For example, the plan to divert water from northern
Brazil's Sao Francisco River to irrigate some 116,000 hectares of dry land in
the poor rural areas of Pernanbuco, Alagoas and Bahia states will leave 140,000
hectares in the Sao Francisco valley without irrigation and will decrease the
generating capacity of the river's power plants (<I>P&amp;F</I> 6/96). Almost
all federal and regional institutions that have studied the project have
criticized it, but it remains on the government budget.</P>
<P>The country's 17.5 million electrically heated showers are also draining
badly needed funds from the electrical system. A Brazilian association of air
conditioner and heating manufacturers spokesman says each shower costs the power
companies $900 a year in distribution costs. Every new electric shower costs the
government $6,000 in generation, transportation and distribution investments, he
adds.</P>
<H3>Pricing Is Worst Problem</H3>
<P>A more important root of potential shortages may be lack of clarity in the
country's pricing system, said Citibank Brazil's privatization director Luis
Macedo following the failed auction of <B>Energetica Nacional,</B> the company
in charge of building the Serra da Mesa dam on the Tocantins river. All the
potential bidders backed out of the August 15 auction, blaming poorly defined
federal pricing policies for energy.&#183;</P>
<H2>New Plan Calls For Grandiose Spending</H2>
<P>The ambitious &quot;Brazil in Action&quot; infrastructure and social
investment program announced last month by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
is calling for $79 billion through the end of the decade, with at least half of
the funds projected to come from the private sector. On the list are 42
projects, including 26 in the infrastructure sector. The initial spending target
is $54 billion through 1998, when Cardoso's term ends, with an additional $25
billion set for 1999. Though much of Brazil in Action covers the same ground as
last year's $93 billion pluriannual investment plan (<I>P&amp;F</I> 10/95), the
new plan concentrates on Cardoso's term, while the pluriannual plan will last
through the first year of the new government.</P>
<P>Potential investments cover privatized companies and activities as well as
new initiatives. Sell-offs will target roads and highways, telecommunications
and power-generation facilities, while new initiatives will focus on the
Bolivian gas pipeline (see page 4) and the development of river transport in the
Parana and Amazon basins.</P>
<P>A total of $29.9 billion is needed through 1998 for projects in
transportation, energy, ports and communications. Top priorities include the Sao
Paulo-Rio Grande do Sul highway, the road from Manaus to the Venezuela border (<I>P&amp;F</I>
2/96), the gas pipeline, river transport, and the Ferronorte railway. Social
projects such as housing, land reform, education, health and small business need
$24.4 billion, or 45% of the first-stage spending.</P>
<H3>Rays Of Light</H3>
<P>So far, most private business executives have given the plan a cautious
reception. One of the bright spots is the government's designation of general
managers for each of the 42 projects, thus enabling interested parties to bypass
the bureaucracy that plagues most federal ministries. Also, government-owned
companies slated for privatization seem to be increasing in value, such as <B>Telebras</B>
and Minas Gerais state power company <B>Cemig,</B> as well as roads to be
concessioned in Parana, Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro.</P>
<H3>Plenty Of Critics</H3>
<P>Doubts center on the public sector's ability to finance the portions of the
plan assigned to it. The federal deficit, steadily rising, is currently
estimated at 3.5% of GDP. Many executives, not to mention the local financial
press, are concerned not only about the deficit but about the plan's heavy
reliance on foreign investment, which is may or may not be attracted to the
projects. Opposition political parties have also lashed out, deriding the plan
as a ploy to gain votes in the November municipal elections. Finance minister
Pedro Malan remains upbeat, predicting year-end foreign investment will surpass
last year's total of close to $9 billion. &#183;  </P>
