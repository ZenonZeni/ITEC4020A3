"What I have learned from orangutans is that we humans must not turn
our backs on our own biological heritage. Modern society promotes the
ideal of the rugged individual. For men you have the Clint Eastwood
persona--the Marlborough Man. For women you have single moms raising
their kids alone. The ideal Western male rides into town, fights the
bad guys, falls in love, and then heads off into the sunset. He is
strong and solitary just like an orangutan but he represents an
evolutionary dead-end. Many of today's problems are a result of
abandoning our human biological roots. We must look to  our
distinctive gregarious human heritage; living and working in family
groups and communities if we want to be successful. Otherwise we are
just stressed out 'orangutans' in an urban setting."</I></B>

<HR NOSHADE>
<P>
The sweat pours down her face. She feels thirsty, not so much hungry.
Swatting at mosquitoes, Dr. Birute Galdikas balances on a slippery
log--"The logs are always slippery. I don't know why, but they always
are"--trying to avoid the thorn vines and toxic bark in the dark dank
<A HREF="http://www.ran.org/ran/">rainforest</A>. She stands waist-deep in tea-coloured swamp water, her
joggers and jeans soaking wet. Two pairs of socks, one tucked under
and one over the jeans keep out leeches and other unspeakable menaces
of the bog. She's wearing a khaki long sleeved shirt with lots of
pockets and a cotton jungle hat she bought at an army surplus store.<P>

<IMG SRC="galdikas-small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>
Catching her breath, she spots two magnificent humongous male
orangutans standing face to face, glaring at each other's massive
cheek pads. They are ready to fight for the chance to mate with the
female that Galdikas has been tracking for days. Actually, she can
only glimpse their shifting shadowy forms in the dense foliage. The
sounds are horrific: snarling, grunting, loud and frightening. They
wrestle and tumble, smashing through the brush, trying to bite each
other on the head and shoulders until one flees into the bush. Moving
forward to see, Galdikas snaps a twig distracting the other one.
Suddenly, he grabs two thick vines, swings down until he hangs only a
metre above her head and stares into her eyes, so close that her
nostrils tingle from the stale odour of orangutan sweat.<P>

In 22 years of jungle observations, she's had only a handful of such
close encounters, so rare are orangutan's meetings with humans or even
their fellow apes. But this fellow's message was clear: "Leave me
alone."<P>

Galdikas has learned more than any other human being about what it
means to be an orangutan, and the cardinal fact is that they like to
be left alone. An adult male's range is at least 40 square kilometres
and he can spend weeks loping slowly from tree to tree eating fruits,
nuts, insects, leaves and bark without ever meeting any of his kin.<P>

"I've always wanted to study the one primate who never left the Garden
of Eden," says Galdikas. "I want to know what we left behind."<P>

Her conclusion: our biologically recent developments of complex
tool-making, language, and social institutions have removed us from
the slow paced, isolated but extremely stable lifestyle of our
prehistoric ancestors in the 'garden'. And we must not forsake these
evolutionary roots, for it is only our distinctly human social ties
that can keep our natural animal greed in check, preserve our
environment and maintain our mental well being.<P>

<B>History</B><P>

When Birute was 12 years old she loved to go into the wilder sections
of High Park in Toronto and pretend she was a Huron or Iroquois native
slipping through the woods, at one with nature. She would spend hours
like this, quietly and secretly observing the wild animals in the
park. Ever since she was 5, Birute wondered where human beings came
from. She knew they evolved from a common ancestor of monkeys and
apes but she wanted to know more. She<P>

<A HREF="http://www.bcyellowpages.com/advert/b/BCHES/dr.htm">Birute Galdikas</A> is the world's leading expert on orangutans, the great
apes that live in the rain-forests of Borneo. She is an
Anthropologist. Anthropology is the study of human beings, but
Galdikas is looking to the great apes who decended from a common
ancestor to help understand the mysteries of human nature.<P>

When she was 22, Galdikas met Dr. Louis Leakey who is famous for
discovering fossils of early humans in Africa. Leakey and the National
Geographic Society helped Galdikas set up a research camp in Borneo to
study orangutans. Although she grew up in Toronto and spends several
months a year teaching in Vancouver at SFU, Galdikas has been living
in the rainforest among the orangutans for the last 23 years.<P>

<IMG SRC="galdikas_orangutan.gif" ALIGN="left">

<H3>1. The Rainforest</H3>
The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable ecosystems on the
planet. A huge variety of plants and animals thrive there, and nothing
has changed for millions of years. This is why the common ancestor for
all apes including humans may have been somewhat like an orangutan.
Orangutans have no serious predators except humans. Their dietary
knowledge of the irregular fruiting patterns of tropical plants
highlights their intelligence. It also explains their solitary
lifestyle and the eight-year interval between births. A big animal
needs a lot of foraging territory without too many others around.<P>

<H3>2. Structural Brachiators</H3>
Orangutans are structural brachiators which means they are built to
swing from branches with their upper limbs, but they have become too
heavy to move quickly like this. Adult orangutans are the largest
tree-dwelling animals on earth, averaging about 100 kilograms for
males.<P>

<H3>3. Food Collecting</H3>
The mother is collecting sweet habu-habu bark for her baby, one of over
400 types of food orangutans enjoy in the rainforest. Galdikas has
tried many herself. One way she has learned to spot orangutans in the
dense foliage is by the sound of dropping fruit peels and pits.<P>

<H3>4. The baby is reaching for the food. </H3>
Through the repeated transfer of food between mother and baby, young
orangutans learn to process food. They watch and imitate. They learn
by trial and error.<P>

<H3>5. Babies</H3>
Baby orangutans cling to their mother's fur until they are 4 years old.
They are very dependent and remain with the mother for nine years.
Females have perhaps 4 offspring in a lifetime. Orangutan males live
solitary lives, appearing briefly to mate. The orangutan's natural
life-span is unknown, but in zoos they have lived for up to 60 years.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>
<HR NOSHADE>

Try being a physical anthropologist and make an activity budget for an
animal you can observe.<P>

You'll Need:<P>
<UL>
<LI> A focal animal. It could be a pet, a human being or a squirrel in the park.
<LI> A notebook, a pencil and a watch.<P>
</UL>
What to do:<P>

Observe your focal animal for at least one hour noting the time and
duration of every activity. Note what he/she does, how he/she holds
things, posture, utterances, everything. Make two columns: one for the
exact time and one for the activity. For instance<P>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>     11:02        Left hand picks up cup
<DD>     11:02:05     Sips about 5 millilitres
</DL>
<IMG SRC="galdikas_piegraph.gif" ALIGN=LEFT hspace=10>
<BR>
<BR>
Afterwards, break down the activities into categories like Eating,
Moving, or Resting, and add up how much time the subject spent on
each. Categories can be divided further. For eating, show time spent
on each type of food. Finally draw a graph.<P>
