<p>How long does it take for crack (or cocaine) to clear out of
urine? </p>

<p>URINE TESTING FOR COCAINE: </p>

<p>Metabolite Detectable Longer Than Expected In Some Cases </p>

<p>&quot;How long will it take for crack (or cocaine) to clear
out of my urine?&quot; is a question received many times a day by
the staff of the Drug &amp; Poison Information Center. It is not
a straightforward question. </p>

<p>First, cocaine itself is metabolized too rapidly to be
measured for routine screening. When urine is being screened for
the presence of cocaine, it is actually benzoylecgonine, a
metabolite of cocaine, that is being measured. </p>

<p>Second, as to how long it will take for this metabolite to be
eliminated from the urine, in some cases the answer may be longer
than traditionally thought. Several studies suggest that
benzoylecgonine can be detected in the urine of chronic, highdose
abusers for longer periods of time than originally expected.
Urine screens currently required by many employers use the
minimum cutoff levels set by the National Institute of Drug Abuse
(NIDA) to establish a positive drug test. A urine level of 300
nanograms per milliliter (or 300 micrograms per liter) of
benzoylecgonine is considered a positive result for cocaine use.
However, these levels can vary in the same individual depending
on when the test is done. For example, first void of the day
samples will yield the highest concentrations of drug
metabolites. Testing urine at other times of the day will yield
differing results, just as the concentration of urine itself
changes throughout the day. </p>

<p>Due to these variations in urine concentration, positive test
results can occur following a negative test result, although no
additional cocaine was used. Many people try to avoid a positive
test result by &quot;watering up,&quot; or drinking large amounts
of fluids to dilute their urine. Ideally, a 24-hour sample should
be taken, but this is impossible in most work settings.
Performing random urine sampling is about the only way to assure
a representative specimen. </p>

<p>The widely accepted time period for benzoylecgonine to be
cleared from the urine is three to five days. One study suggests
that high dose users (i.e., 0.5 gram or greater for each episode
of use) can test positive after eight days. Another study claims
that benzoylecgonine can be detected in heavy cocaine users for
10-14 days. The longest time over which positive urine levels of
benzoylecgonine were detected was 10-22 days. This was after
chronic use of extremely high doses of 112 grams per week. Since
it is usually difficult to determine exactly how much cocaine is
being abused by a caller, it seems that a broader range of
potential detection times should be given when explaining cocaine
metabolism in regard to urine testing. </p>
