<h2>Dispatch From the Drug War</h2>

<p>by Peter H. King</p>

<p>Here's how it works in the never-ending War on Drugs: In
August a federal<br>
agency reports that 32 of 4,500 teenagers surveyed respond that
they took<br>
heroin in 1995. The year before, the same survey had found 14
teenagers<br>
who copped to heroin usage. Other categories show upticks as
well, but the<br>
increase in teen heroin usage is what grabs the headlines.<br>
Now put aside, as the surveyors must, whether the teenagers were
telling<br>
the truth. Also disregard the warning from polling experts that
the size<br>
of the sample is statistically insignificant, that-as one told
the Wall<br>
Street Journal-&quot;we should be careful not to overinterpret
the findings or<br>
jump to policy conclusions.&quot;<br>
This is the War on Drugs, and patriotic Americans must follow the
example<br>
of their political leaders. They must suspend reality. Let the
numbers<br>
speak for themselves: Heroin use-no, the shorthand is better,
drug use-has<br>
&quot;doubled&quot; among American teenagers. This cannot be
tolerated. This<br>
demands action. In this case, action translates into a new Bob
Dole<br>
television commercial suggesting President Clinton is &quot; soft
on drugs.&quot;<br>
Clinton counters by hurling more tough words and weapons into the
war.<br>
On Tuesday, to provide just the latest example, the White House
announced<br>
it would give $112 million in materiel to Colombia, Peru and
other Latin<br>
American countries. For Mexico alone, the 18 additional teen
heroin users<br>
will translate into 53 UH- 1H helicopters. All this equipment,
states the<br>
White House, &quot;will assist our allies in stopping the flow of
drugs at the<br>
source, before they reach our shores.&quot;<br>
Can anyone out there spell &quot;hallucinate?&quot;<br>
We break now from this Drug War dispatch for a few words from the
home<br>
front. The speaker is James P. Gray, a conservative Superior
Court judge<br>
in conservative Orange County. For the past four years, Gray has
been<br>
engaged in a grass-roots effort to spark a national discussion
over a<br>
provocative alternative to the War on Drugs. Yes, brace yourself,
Gray is<br>
talking &quot;decriminalization.&quot;<br>
From the bench, he has seen the war's downside, the steady steam
of<br>
nickel-and-dime users and dealers who-to satisfy take-the-hill
political<br>
rhetoric-are treated as the worst of criminals rather than as
sick people. <br>
He has weighed the cost of the trials and incarceration as
compared to<br>
treatment. He has seen how hardened criminals must be released to
make<br>
cell space for the prisoners of the War on Drugs. He has seen the
&quot;utter<br>
hopelessness of what we are doing: spending hundreds of millions
of dollars<br>
in an effort that accomplishes virtually nothing.&quot;<br>
Gray speaks frequently on the issue,' and he always begins by
testing the<br>
audience: &quot;The first question out of my mouth is, 'Who here
feels our<br>
country is in better shape today in regard to drug use and abuse
and all<br>
the crime and misery that goes with it than it was five years
ago?' And<br>
nobody raises a hand. Ever.<br>
&quot;And so my follow-up to that is this: 'OK. We all realize we
are not in<br>
better shape. We also have no legitimate expectation of being in
better<br>
shape next year than today-unless we change our approach.'
&quot;And that's when<br>
people start to listen.&quot;<br>
Simply getting people to listen is no small accomplishment for
advocates of<br>
decriminalization, so thoroughly has the politicians wartime
propaganda<br>
been pounded home. Gray must remind his audiences he is not for
drugs. <br>
Indeed, he, calls them &quot;garbage.&quot; What he is for is a
rethinking of the War<br>
on Drugs mentality &quot;We are willing to spend all this money
to put people in<br>
prison, but not on things that would do some good, namely
education, drug<br>
treatment and holding people accountable for their actions. The
War on<br>
<br>
Drugs increases street crime on the one, hand, and it takes away
sources<br>
for its prosecution on the other. Every dollar we spend on
undercover drug<br>
operations is a dollar we take away from going after murder,
rape,<br>
burglary, driving-under-the-influence and everything else.&quot;<br>
There also is collateral damage to consider. The war mode jacks
up the<br>
street value of narcotics, creating a drug economy that, absent
of<br>
alternatives, many people simply find too lucrative to resist. It
has<br>
created a whole stable of Capones, a line of profiteers that runs
from<br>
South Los Angeles to the Caribbean cocaine countries, while
corrupting<br>
narcotics officers from Los Angeles County to New York City.
Worse, has<br>
bloodied the streets of American cities-the trenches of the drug
war.<br>
It also has created a political environment where candidates dare
not<br>
mention decriminalization, inhalation or anything that might be
taken as<br>
backing away from the War on Drugs. In such a climate, the safest
course<br>
is to toss money down the rat hole and hide behind catchy
slogans.<br>
&quot;Just Don't Do It,&quot; chants Candidate Dole. Now that
ought to fix things,<br>
right?<br>
