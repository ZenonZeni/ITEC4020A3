<h1>Clinton's cancer drug reforms</h1> </center> <p>

<b><center>By Steve Usdin<br>
Contributing Editor</b></center><p>
WASHINGTON -- President Bill Clinton on Friday announced a series of administrative actions by the FDA to speed development and approval of cancer drugs that in some respects goes beyond steps the agency has taken to accelerate the path of AIDS drugs to market.<p>
The steps represent significant regulatory departures that may have implications beyond cancer. The FDA will take a proactive role in fostering development of drugs and ensuring that they are available to patients, including soliciting applications for U.S. approval for products approved overseas and, for the first time, taking foreign regulatory approvals into consideration.<p>
Administration officials suggested that similar steps may be undertaken to speed development and approval of therapies for all serious and life-threatening diseases. Clinton and FDA Commissioner David Kessler compared the new actions to the accelerated approval mechanisms for AIDS drugs implemented in 1992.<p>
Kessler told reporters at the White House that "we want very much to create the same kind of incentive, the same kind of stimulus, for the development of all drugs, not only for AIDS and cancer, but of all serious and life-threatening diseases."<p>
<b><center>Accepting risk</b></center><p>
Kessler also signaled a thawing of FDA's "zero risk" attitude. "We are taking some risks," he said. "One day we are going to make a mistake, but I believe that is OK, especially when we are dealing with diseases for which there are no available therapies."<p>
The cancer drug initiative consists of four elements: accelerated approval for cancer drugs; expanded access for drugs approved in other countries; increased cancer patient representation at FDA advisory committee meetings; and less red tape for additional uses of approved cancer drugs. <p>
Clinton said the changes, which went into effect immediately, "will cut development time for cancer drugs by as much as several years." He added that  "at the same time, FDA will cut its review time of these drugs from 12 months to 6 months."<p>
The reforms are part of Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review or "reinventing government" initiative. Gore said the changes "will mean an end to all of the stories that we used to hear about interminable delays" in approving cancer therapies.<p>
Following are highlights of the changes:<p>
<h3>Accelerated approvals</h3>
Cancer drugs can receive accelerated approval based on demonstration of tumor shrinkage in patients with refractory malignant diseases or for those who have no adequate alternative.<p>
Accelerated approval usually will be contingent on the sponsor's agreement to conduct post-approval studies to "further define the utility of the new agent for the approved and/or other indications, either alone or in combination with other agents," FDA said.<p>
At the White House briefing, Kessler said "this will allow us to rely on smaller, shorter studies for the initial approval of cancer drugs." He added: "Use of similar approaches to drug evaluation and review in our experience with AIDS therapies has been a powerful stimulus to the development of new and important agents, especially for people who need them most."<p>
The agency stated that it will not require that post-approval studies be conducted in the exact population for which the approval was granted. <p>
Post-approval studies of products intended to remove treatment-associated toxicities will have to evaluate their effect on survival and/or demonstrate correlations between the surrogate measures used in the accelerated approval and clinical benefit. The agency said the new policy will encourage sponsors to submit supplemental applications for secondary indications and expedite their approval.<p>
According to an FDA document released Friday, "therapies for cancer patients have usually been approved on the basis of objective response to the agent (tumor shrinkage) together with direct evidence that the therapy produces measurable clinical benefit. Typical approval end points have included response rate together with increased patient survival, decreased recurrence rate, increased disease-free interval, and/or improved quality of life. It has been assumed that durable, complete clinical response (complete disappearance of detectable tumor) is a valid surrogate for such clinical benefit, but it is only infrequently achieved.<p>
"Much more commonly, partial tumor shrinkages are induced, and evidence has accumulated that such responses are often directly linked to longer or better patient survival. In fact, for certain new agents, FDA has already begun to rely on a reasonably high rate of verifiable objective partial response to the therapy as a basis for approval of agents to treat refractory malignancies, without requiring evidence of improved survival or quality of life."<p>
<h3>Therapies approved abroad</h3>
Kessler announced a major crack in the wall FDA has erected against the admission of regulatory decisions from foreign countries. "We will expedite the availability of promising medications that have been approved in certain other countries," he said. <p>
Kessler described a proactive approach under which FDA "will approach regulatory bodies in other countries and survey them. If there are drugs approved in those countries (for cancer) that are not approved here, we will approach the manufacturer and ask the manufacturer to give us the same information they supplied to countries abroad and see whether we can make the drug available under expanded access. Patients can have access to it at the same time that we are getting the data to determine ultimately if the drug works." <p>
Expanded access mechanisms applicable to cancer drugs include Treatment INDs, Group C drugs made available through the National Cancer Institute, and "compassionate use" (single patient) protocols.<p>
If there is no U.S. sponsor, the agency plans to encourage the foreign sponsor to file an IND and then encourage submission of an expanded access protocol.<p>
The FDA said that foreign regulatory authorities considered under this policy must "be identified as having review practices, review standards, and access to specialized expertise in the evaluation of agents for use in cancer treatment that are sufficient to allow FDA to conclude that a marketing approval action by that authority is likely to provide an adequate basis for proper consideration of an expanded access protocol for U.S. patients." Countries that use English will be contacted first, according to the agency, with initial contact planned within 30 days.<p>
<h3>Patient representation</h3>
Many FDA advisory panels, including those that consider cancer drugs, already have consumer representatives. The new policy ensures that all advisory panels dealing with cancer therapies have an ad hoc consumer representative and that he or she has "experience with the specific malignancy for which a therapeutic product is under consideration," FDA said.<p>
The agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register and conduct an outreach campaign to attract participants.<p>
<h3>Policy on INDs</h3>
"We will eliminate unnecessary paperwork that used to delay or discourage cancer research by non-commercial clinical investigators," Kessler said. <p>
The agency stated that  INDs needn't be submitted for studies of new uses of an approved drug or biological product if the agent "will be used in generally the same patient population and in generally the same manner for which the agent was approved, and the study is not intended to support approval of the new use or to support a significant change in the labeling or advertising of the product."<p>
FDA said unnecessary INDs are sometimes submitted when investigators or Institutional Review Boards incorrectly believe they are required. In other instances, manufacturers agree to provide free drugs and, incorrectly, think FDA will view the donation of product as a promotional activity if an IND is not filed.<P>
FDA stated that it will not consider supply of a marketed product for use in a study as  a promotional activity if it is being used in a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation.<p>

<b>From BioCentury, April 8, 1996</b><p>
<center><h2><i>The details matter</i></h2>
<h1>Wait-and-see on cancer drug reforms</h1></center>

<b><center>By Steve Usdin<br>
Contributing Editor</b></center><p>
WASHINGTON -- The FDA's administrative reform of its regulation of cancer therapies represents a public commitment by the agency to put into uniform practice measures that it has, for the most part, already implemented on an ad hoc basis, according to several senior managers of biotech companies with cancer therapies in the pipeline.<p>
Although they welcomed the recent proclamations by President Clinton and FDA Commissioner David Kessler that the agency would transform its best practices into standard operating procedures, the industry executives told BioCentury that the tone of the announcements may be more important than the substance, and the most important audience might be FDA staff, rather than the patients and industry officials to whom they were ostensibly addressed.<p>
<b><center>Recalibrating risk</b></center><p>
A change from the FDA's current tendency to a one size fits all, zero-risk tolerance policy to a policy that allows for higher risk quotients in the case of all life-threatening diseases, would be more important than any of the specific policy changes, they said.<p>
If the attitudes Kessler expressed permeated the agency <i>(see BioCentury, April 1), </i>sponsors would see fewer bureaucratic impediments and patients and physicians would have more options for dealing with often fatal cancers for which there are no effective therapies. On the other hand, in the absence of such a cultural change, the "new" policies might have little impact.<p>
Some executives are skeptical of Kessler's claims that FDA's decision to accept surrogate data, especially evidence of tumor shrinkage, will play a dramatic role in speeding the development of new cancer drugs. They pointed out that tumor shrinkage has been the basis of approvals for cancer therapies in the past, notably the approval of Taxotere for ovarian cancer, and the agency has accepted it as the primary end point in several ongoing Phase II and III trials for cancer therapies. <p>
<b><center>Beyond shrinkage</b></center><P>
And although there may be some diminution in the degree of linkage between tumor shrinkage and clinical effect required for approval, manufacturers still will have to demonstrate that their products provide patient benefit and have some durability in order to persuade physicians to use them and insurance companies to pay for them.<p>
Similarly, there was some skepticism and ambivalence among the executives about the increased use of accelerated approvals and expanded access protocols for cancer therapies. The benefits of these and other "reforms" to cancer patients and the manufacturers will depend in large measure on how they are implemented, they said.<p>
Accelerated approvals, for example, are contingent on post-market studies. The fruits of accelerated approval could be soured if FDA imposes onerous Phase IV trial requirements.<p>
Likewise, expanded access can get potentially effective therapies to patients rapidly and can help sponsors by educating physicians. The benefits of expanded access programs can be lost, however, if they make it more difficult to conduct well-controlled trials.<p>
Paul Abrams, president and CEO of NeoRx Corp. (NERX -- Seattle, Wash.), said that "the most important thing in my opinion is not that you now can get approval based on responses to surrogates. The most important thing, if it is carried forward, is the infusion within the agency of the concept that we are taking a very different risk profile with regard to approval of these drugs.<p>
"Before it was 'you cannot make any mistake or off with you heads.' Now they are saying that type of zero-risk profile is no longer warranted in patients with these dreadful diseases for which there is no therapy. If that is infused within the bureaucracy, it will be the most important element. Then you will be dealing with people throughout the entire drug development phase who have a different attitude about what you are doing."<p>
Abrams said the commitment to review cancer therapies in six months, half the period FDA is committed to at present, has limited importance. He noted there are numerous ways to suspend the clock, such as sending letters requesting additional information.<p>
The reduced review time "is much less important to me than if the philosophy of zero risk will be changed for products such as those we are developing for cancer and other life threatening or serious diseases for which there is no other treatment," Abrams said.<p>
"If it doesn't pervade the agency and people are looking for the same degrees of certainty as before, then all you'll get is the letter that stops the tolling of review time."<p>
<b><center>'More muscle'</b></center><p>
Regarding Kessler's announcement that FDA will start approving drugs based on tumor shrinkage, without requiring survival or other demonstration of clinical benefit, Abrams said that "they have actually been operating on the basis of approving drugs for tumor regressions as opposed to survivor indicators for quite some time.<p>
"Bristol-Myers' Taxol was approved on the basis of a 25 percent response rate in patients with ovarian cancer. It is not new that this can happen. The fact that it has become a little more public and now is stated as a policy as opposed to something happening in the ranks puts more muscle behind the policy. It makes it less likely for the agency as a whole to say 'we can't do that'."<P>
Abrams said the new policies will not change NERX's product development plans. Development plans for the company's cancer therapies already were predicated on an understanding that FDA will approve cancer therapies based on good response of surrogate markers in Phase II trials.<p>
"Our products are being designed with the hope that we can cause tumor regressions without the side effects and toxicities that have been associated with most systemic therapies for cancer. Our operating premise was, is, and will remain until there is reason for changing, that if you have a product that has a high safety profile and it can cause the same type of tumor regression that was seen before, it is a high value-added product and should be looked on favorably by the agency."<p>
Similarly, the product development strategy at Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AGPH -- La Jolla, Calif.) already had taken for granted the assumptions underlying the FDA's announcement. "We've assumed that approval was a possibility based on robust Phase II data because there was significant precedent for that in the agency already," said President and CEO Peter Johnson.<p>
Johnson withheld predictions about the impact of the policies pending explanation of how they will be implemented. "I'm concerned to know the full details. No doubt the agency's intentions are good and it wants to get drugs through the development pipeline quicker, but I will reserve judgement on the extent to which it is a major improvement until we learn more about how the agency plans to administer the approach."<p>
Johnson expressed particular concern about the implementation of accelerated approvals, which are contingent on Phase IV post-marketing trials. "The announcement emphasizes accelerated approval, which puts an emphasis on post-approval studies. To know if this is a significant step forward, we need to know what the requirements for Phase IV studies will be," he said.<p>
<b><center>New indications</b></center><p>
Johnson suggested that accelerated approval could be burdensome if FDA required inappropriately difficult, time-consuming or expensive Phase IV studies. He noted that accelerated approval is not currently required in order to obtain a product approval based on Phase II data. "Taxol got full approval from Phase II data based on a historical comparator," said Johnson.<p>
William Rastetter, president and CEO of Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. (IDPH -- La Jolla, Calif.), is optimistic that the commitment to reduced review times will be helpful. "If the FDA lives up to a six-month review, it will change the timing of our product launch, which certainly is good news," he said. "If FDA reviews cancer applications in six months and gives them the same priority it has given to AIDS drugs, that will have a tremendously positive impact on companies developing cancer drugs."<p>
I. Craig Henderson, chairman and CEO at Sequus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SEQU -- Menlo Park, Calif.), also emphasized the importance of the commitment to speeding approvals.<p>
"It will be a while before we see what it actually means," he said. "One of the things that will make a lot of difference is if it impacts on companies that are going back for additional indications. That is the status we are in. If FDA were to streamline that process, it would be absolutely great news and would have a profound impact."<p>
Speeding up approvals of supplemental applications would be a significant change because of the high level of off-label use in oncology, Abrams said. "The history of cancer therapy is that it is exceedingly rare that the major use for a product has been the initial indication it was approved for," he said. "Usually it is used in other doses or schedules or for other diseases. The medical community is still not very smart about knowing how to treat cancer, so it is hard to believe that any one company at any one time will find the best way to use a drug the first time they apply to put it on the market."<p>
Despite the public blessing of the tumor shrinkage surrogate end point, Rastetter predicted that companies are not likely to design trials to look at tumor remission without also considering duration of response. It will be very difficult, he said, to convince oncologists and patients to use a product if durability of response has not been demonstrated.<p>
Edward Erickson, president and CEO of DepoTech Corp. (DEPO -- San Diego, Calif.) also concluded that although the FDA's moves send positive signals, "they are not breakthroughs. They are going public with basic things that have been going on for some time." He said DEPO had negotiated with FDA "some years ago on trials with response rate as the primary end point.<p>
"It turned out that we showed survival benefit in an interim analysis of the data, so it was not relevant. But we used response rate as the primary end point in the trial. So we've really been operating under the guidelines that FDA has now gone public with."<p>
<b><center>Caution on access</b></center><p>
Ed Silverman, COO of The Liposome Co. Inc. (LIPO -- Princeton, N.J.), cautioned that FDA must be careful about implementing expanded access. "If there is pressure to make drugs available for expanded access too early, it could potentially preclude the ability to do real clinical trials. Without real clinical trials, it is difficult to persuade physicians to use drugs," he said.<p>
"Expanded access should be used when trials are well underway or have been completed, once you know you have a winner. Expanded access is a good way to pre-market the drug and it is ethically sound. But if you start expanded access too early, you can't do placebo trials and you can't prove that drugs work."<p> 
The agency has scheduled a meeting of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee on April 19 to discuss implementation of the new regulations. <P>
