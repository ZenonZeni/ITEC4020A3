</H2><P><I>"Aikido is the principle of nonresistance.  Because it is
nonresistant, it is victorious from the beginning.
Those with evil intentions or contentious thoughts
are instantly vanquished." -- Morihei Ueshiba, Founder of Aikido</I>
<BR><BR>
Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art with roots in Jujitsu, Kendo,
and Judo.  It emphasizes unbalancing throws and pins,
and the student learns how to redirect an attacker's motions instead of
trying to stop them by force.  As a result, balance and perception
become more important than physical size or strength.
<BR><BR>
The name of Aikido is composed of three Japanese words: <I>ai</I>,
meaning harmony; <I>ki</I>, spirit or energy; <I>do</I>, the path,
system or way.  Aikido is <I>the way of the spirit of harmony.</I>
<BR><BR>
Martial arts are studied for self-defense and self-improvement,
but Aikido is different from other martial arts in that the
practitioner seeks to achieve self-defense without injury to
attackers.  Instead of being a tool for the correction of others,
Aikido is a way through which students become more aware of their
own potentials and limitations.
<BR><BR>
Aikido is not a sport.  There are no competitive tournaments.
The Aikidoist betters his or her self without belittling others.
And because Aikido seeks no harm to others, techniques can be
practiced at full power without fear of injury.
<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=history_of_aikido>A History of Aikido</A>
</H2><P>Morihei Ueshiba, called <I>O-Sensei</I> (meaning "great teacher"),
founded the martial art known throughout the world today as
Aikido.  Born in 1883 in Japan, he dedicated himself to becoming strong
after seeing his father attacked by political opponents.  He sought
out and studied with masters in several martial arts, eventually
becoming an expert in jujitsu (the art of weaponless combat),
kenjitsu (combat with a sword), and sojitsu (combat with a spear).
<BR><BR>
Dissatisfied with mere strength and technical mastery,
he also immersed himself in religious and philosopical studies.
The stories of his immense physical strength and martial
prowess are impressive enough, but more important is the
legacy of non-violence and human integrity he has left mankind.
<BR><BR>
In early 20th-century Japan, involvement in the martial parts
was a competitive and dangerous business.  Contests, feuds
and rivalries often resulted in injuries and deaths.
The formulation of Aikido dates from an incident that
occured in 1925.  In the course of a discussion about the
martial arts, a disagreement arose between O-Sensei and a
naval officer who was also a fencing instructor.
The officer challenged O-Sensei to a match, and attacked with
a wooden sword.  O-Sensei faced the officer unarmed, and won
the match by evading blows until his attacker dropped
from exhaustion.  O-Sensei later recalled that he had felt
his opponent's movements before they where executed, and that
this was the beginning of his enlightenment.  He had
defeated an armed attacker without hurting him -- without
even touching him.
<BR><BR>
O-Sensei later wrote: <I>"Budo (the Martial Way) is not
felling the opponent by our force; nor is it a tool to lead
the world into destruction with arms.  True budo is to accept
the spirit of the universe, keep the peace of the world,
correctly produce, protect and cultivate all things in Nature."</I>.
<BR><BR>
O-Sensei continued to practice and teach Aikido into his old age.
Observers marveled at his martial abilities, vitality, and
good humor.  He was still giving public demonstrations of Aikido
at age 86, four months before his death.
After he passed away on April 26, 1969, the Japanese government
postumously declared Morihei Ueshiba a Sacred National Treasure
of Japan.
<BR><BR>
O-Sensei's son, Kissomaru Ueshiba, inherited the title
<I>Doshu</I> ("Leader of the Way") and continues his
father's work at Hombu Dojo, Aikido World Headquarters, in
Tokyo, Japan.  Today, Aikido is practiced by men, women
and children throughout the world, and O-Sensei's
teachings enrich the lives of thousands of people.

</H2><P>Aikido offers practical self-defense, but more importantly,
it teaches self-improvement.  Aikido is more than the study
of physical techinques.  Proper etiquette, attitude and
behavior are also emphasized.  Throwing and falling are
stressed equally -- one's practice partner is not an opponent.
Techniques are acquired by being thrown, and
practiced by throwing.  Aikido improves not only one's
physical conditioning (stamina, balance, flexibility,
coordination, strength and resilience) but also mental
conditioning:  self confidence, concentration, alertness
and concern for others.
<BR><BR>
Also, Aikido has an ethic:  <I>to defend yourself without
vengeance, to forgive your enemies, and to harmonize with
any attack of any description.</I>  Aikido technique is a
metaphor for a way to lead your life:  avoid confrontations,
harmonize with unavoidable challenges, and maintain grace
under pressure through good times and bad.
<BR><BR>
Because Aikido does not depend on physical strength, it is
attractive to men and women of all sizes and ages, and can
be practiced well into old age.  In addition to empty-handed
techniques, techniques using or defending against weapons
such as the <I>jo</I> (walking staff), <I>bokken</I>
(wooden sword), and <I>tanto</I> (knife) are also taught.
