<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Keys to a Successful Retirement Program</STRONG></FONT><P>


To ensure the success of your plan, we have designed our programs to cover six key
elements:
<P>
<STRONG>Ease Of Administration</STRONG><BR>
A successful plan involves coordination among the company, the investment provider,
and the
administration firm. Our program greatly reduces the work involved in plan
operations and
administration by providing:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Complete design and set-up services
	<LI>IRS approved prototype documents
	<LI>Personal Plan Consultant
	<LI>IRS 5500 Forms
	<LI>Employee 800 number
	<LI>Plan Sponsor 800 number
	<LI>Benefit processing
	<LI>IRS Form 1099R preparation
	<LI>Quarterly employer reports
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Simplified Compliance</STRONG><BR>
Compliance involves setting up and operating the plan according to the Internal
Revenue Code and
regulations, Department of Labor (DOL) rules and regulations, and the plan
provisions.
<P>
The Plan Administrator of the MainStay Retirement Program offers you a comprehensive compliance
package that will provide you with:
<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>IRS approved plan documents
	<LI>Notification of required plan amendments.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Cost effectiveness</STRONG><BR>
Before you implement a plan, you need to evaluate its cost. Administration fees,
legal and regulatory
compliance costs, and the time you spend with the plan are all elements which
factor into the total cost
of a retirement plan. Once these have been determined, these elements can be
weighed against the
cost of other retirement benefit plans, the total cost if benefits were purchased
separately, the tax
savings the plan will provide, and the cost of waiting to begin the plan.
<P>
You may also want to weigh benefits such as improved employee loyalty and morale,
better employee
retention, future financial security, and other benefits of your company.
<P>
MainStay's retirement programs currently provide these important advantages with:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A complete turnkey program
	<LI>Fees below the  American Society of Pension Actuaries national average.
</UL>

<STRONG>Investments</STRONG><BR>
Breadth of selection and depth of investment expertise are critical to the success
of your plan. In
addition to attractive investment options, employees may need help evaluating their
investment options and
selecting those which are appropriate to their individual needs.
<P>
Since investment performance will largely determine how much your employees have at
retirement,
MainStay's program offers a wide selection of MainStay Mutual Funds and a
Guaranteed Investment
Contract (GIC) from New York Life.
<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Your plan can provide up to eight investment options, including a Money
Market Fund
	<LI>Personalized investment counseling from your Registered Representative
	<LI>Daily valuation of funds and accounts
	<LI>Ability to move money anytime, within plan provisions
	<LI>Quarterly statements for ongoing performance monitoring.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Effective Communications</STRONG><BR>
Another key to the plan's success is the quality of the communications you and your
employees
receive. MainStay's retirement programs provide ongoing sponsor information and
employee
education.
You will receive the reports and data you need to continually monitor the progress
of your Plan. Your
employees are provided with regular statements and daily access to current fund and
account data.
<P>
MainStay provides a wide variety of communications at every stage of the plan
process:
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>Fund information and prospectuses
	<LI>Participant 800 number
	<LI>Quarterly participant statements
	<LI>Plan sponsor 800 number
	<LI>Registered Representative follow-up.
</UL>

<STRONG>High Participation For 401(k) Plans</STRONG><BR>
A high level of participation is essential to the long-term success of the plan.
Low participation is often
an indication that employees do not fully understand the benefits of their 401(k)
plan. Participation
levels can affect the results of the Average Deferral Percentage (ADP) test.
Failure to pass this test
could limit the amount of contributions your highly compensated employees can make
to the plan.
<P>
The MainStay 401(k) encourages high participation levels by providing you with a
complete
communications package and enrollment assistance, including:
<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Pre-enrollment communications
	<LI>Professionally conducted enrollment meetings
	<LI>Saving for Your Future video
	<LI>Personalized plan savings analysis
	<LI>Information and guidance in setting investment objectives.
